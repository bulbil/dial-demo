		A V77 * AL HISTORICAL WORK The German Element in the
United States	LOCATION	By
ALBERT BERNHARDT FAUST	PERSON	Assistant Professor of German in
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	An \ important historical work of great popular interest to many readers .

		THE first volume deals with the history of the Germans in this country from the earliest times to the present .

		Beginning with an account of the first Germans who came to
America	LOCATION	with
Leif Ericson	PERSON	in the
11th century	DATE	, Professor
Faust	PERSON	carries the narrative down through the founding of
Germantown	LOCATION	and the large German immigration to
New York	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Virginia	LOCATION	, and
South Carolina	LOCATION	in the
early 18th century	DATE	, to the notable part played by them in the pushing out of the Western frontier , and in the wars of the
19th century	DATE	, e. g. , War of
1812	DATE	, Mexican War .

		Civil War , and Spanish War .

		He concludes with a general summary of German immigration through the
19th century	DATE	, and an account of the location , distribution and general character of the immigrants .

		This volume is based upon the re-examination of a vast amount of material and draws likewise upon numerous sources hitherto unstudied .

		It is well arranged and thoroughly documented , yet it is so full of picturesque detail and illustrative anecdote that it is readable from start to finish .

		The second volume makes a searching analysis of the influence of the German element in our American civilization , and traces in the most interesting way the influence of the Germans on the material development of our country in both agriculture and manufacture , upon our political institutions , education and social life , and music , literature , and the drama , and the important part played by prominent Germans of to-day .

		The book is lavishly illustrated with maps , portraits of eminent German-Americans , both pioneers and contemporaries , facsimiles of important documents and historical scenes .

		In short , the work is the first to deal exhaustively with this important subject , and will be indispensable for historical scholars , and of great value and interest for the general reader , while its appeal to readers of German birth will be unique .

		BRIEFER MENTION 23 NOTES 23 TOPICS IN
DECEMBER	DATE	PERIODICALS ... 24 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 24 PHILOSOPHIC DOUBTS CONCERNING CR ITICI SM .

		Public life in
England	LOCATION	has one happy char - acteristic which has not been developed to any considerable degree in our own country .

		It does call to its posts of leadership and responsi - bility men of intellectual distinction -- men who have already made their mark , or who are by way of making their mark , in other and less tur - bulent fields than those of politics .

		Men of the type of
Lord Morley	PERSON	, Mr.
Haldane	PERSON	, Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, and Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	rise to high positions despite their possession of that fine culture which would be to them an almost insuperable barrier in this country .

		Try to imagine , for example , Mr.
William James	PERSON	, or Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, or the late Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	, as members of the national legisla - ture , and you have a concrete illustration of this fundamental difference between the two coun - tries .

		On the other hand , try to imagine Speaker Cannon dashing off a little thing on aesthetics , or Senator Aldrich acquiring meta - physical fame -LRB- on any other subject than that of the tariff -RRB- in his hours of studious retirement , and another illustration of the same negative sort is provided .

		The scholar is indeed rara avis in the American politics of to-day , and the most frequently mentioned example is one of whom we are not exactly proud .

		In
England	LOCATION	it is different -- so different that when , for example , the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	authorities wished to name the Romanes lecturer for the present year , they naturally turned to the graceful and subtle philosopher who is the present leader of the
Opposition	ORGANIZATION	in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's address , as given in the Sheldonian Theatre about a month ago , now lies before us , and has for its title '' Questionings on Criticism and Beauty . ''

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	is an adept at ques - tioning , and the pale cast of his thought , when directed toward the subject of aesthetic criticism , forces him into his favorite attitude of philo - sophic doubt . ''

		The amount of splendid literary and other artistic work which has been produced since the revival of learning is the glory of our modern civilization .

		The amount of intellectual energy which has been thrown into the criticism of literature and of art is very great , and yet I think that anybody who has studied that criti - cism can not but feel profoundly depressed by the char - acter of its total output .

		In the course of your survey you will come upon the names of men whose critical THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, labours have made them immortal ; but if you ask what they have done , you will usually find that what they have done is to sweep away the rubbish of their critical pre - decessors ; you will usually find that where they have failed is in not having made that drastic process of purgation sufficiently complete . ''

		This is sad if true , and a melancholy commen - tary upon the futility of all human endeavor to create a philosophy of the beautiful ; for it follows that our own most admired modern judgments -LRB- Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	's included -RRB- will in time go into the rubbish heap , to be succeeded by new and equally unstable appreciations .

		But we can not believe the situation to be really as bad as all this , in spite of skeptics like Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, or subjectivists like
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, or iconoclasts like Mr.
G. B. Shaw	PERSON	, or aesthetic agnostics like
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		How - ever such men may rail at the pedantry of the critics , or deny the gift of real vision to the in - terpreters of literature , or deplore the sophisti - cation that befogs their judgment , there remains a very definite canon of the beautiful which has been beaten into shape amid the warring of schools , the clashing of critical temperaments , and the shifting of points of view .

		We know pretty definitely , and can make fairly clear the reasons , why Sophocles was a greater poet than Euripides , and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	than
Schiller	PERSON	, and
Tenny	PERSON	- son than
Browning	PERSON	.

		As individuals we may make grievous mistakes about our contempora - ries , but as students of the history of literature we accept the registered verdicts , primarily be - cause they are reasonable , and the consider - ations that support them have the clear signs of validity .

		After all , Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	saves himself from the extreme lengths of skepticism , as usual , by his qualifications and reservations .

		He may assert that '' nobody lays down rules now , '' and that '' rules of correct composition are buried among lumber of the past , '' but he also admits that '' superficially at all events there is a very great appearance of unanimity , in this eclectic age , as to what is or what is not a successful work of art . '' ''

		Are we to take as a test , '' he asks , `` the feelings of men of trained sensibility ?

		Are we to take , if that is true , the man who has cultivated a particular art , and acquainted him - self with its technique , its principles , its history , and studied it and cultivated it ?

		And if we take him shall we attain to anything in the nature of an agreement as to what truly consti - tutes excellence in artistic production ? ''

		If Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	really wishes us to answer these questions he is welcome to our decided affirma - tive .

		But he is not more than half sincere in asking them , for he goes on to cite certain noto - rious eccentricities of judgment -LRB- on the part of
Arnold	LOCATION	and
Kuskin	PERSON	-RRB- as things that '' we hush up as quickly as we can , '' and to say that '' on the whole , cultured persons show a tolerably united front to their enemies . ''

		This is pretty nearly conceding the whole point of Mr.
Bal	PERSON	- four 's questionings , unless one goes over bag and baggage to the Tolstoyan camp , and holds the untutored hind the only truly competent juror in matters aesthetic .

		And this our author , although he toys with the notion , is not quite prepared to do .

		The plea that beauty is its own excuse for being , needing no further exposition or justifi - cation , will never fully satisfy the mind that seeks an essential part of its happiness in learn - ing the causes of things .

		To stand upon that proposition alone is to plant one 's feet upon a quicksand , to cast one 's mind adrift from all its moorings .

		A man convinced of the proposition would still have to ignore it in practice , just as the convinced determinist can not help assuming himself to be a free agent .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	rather childishly argues that because when a boy at
Eton	LOCATION	he revelled in '' the various works of fiction which are the joy of youth , '' and experienced a careless rapture in this reading which his con - templative and discriminative years now deny him , no matter how much finer the art which engages his attention , that because of this mel - ancholy contrast he wonders if he has not lost the capacity for `` true aesthetic enjoyment . ''

		This is philosophic doubt carried to the point of perversity , and not likely to be shared by any persons of cultivated taste whose judgment has not become unbalanced through overmuch intro - spection .

		It really begs the whole question , and in about the same way in which it is begged by the champions of hedonistic ethics when they refuse to recognize the fundamental distinction between the pleasures of the sense and the joy that the spirit takes in self-sacrifice and high impersonal endeavor .


Frederic Remington	PERSON	, famous for his spirited illustrations from Western frontier life , but known also as a painter , sculptor , and writer , died at
Ridge	LOCATION	- field ,
Conn.	LOCATION	,
December 26	DATE	, at the age of forty-eight .

		He was born in
New York State	LOCATION	, but had lived much in the
West	LOCATION	, where his varied experiences -- as '' cow - puncher , '' ranchman , and scout -- gave him the in - timate knowledge of scenes and characters that were so strikingly delineated in his pictures .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE
DIAL ABOUT NATIONAL ACADEMIES	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	, having erected a
Hall	PERSON	of Fame and brought it into notice by excluding the one indubi - tably famous American poet , has made the country a present of a
National Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The composition of this
Senate of Immortals	ORGANIZATION	, as given in a recent number of The Diai , -LRB-
November 1	DATE	-RRB- , is a matter for curious study .

		There is a fair representation of
New Englanders	LOCATION	, and a few other exiles from the Great White Way ; but the pomp and prodigality of
New York	LOCATION	genius is mainly in evidence .

		And doubtless
New York	LOCATION	could have done better by itself , had it not been too magnanimous not to let the rest of the country have a look in .

		A good third of the names would probably be inevitable in any list of distinguished living Americans .

		But the others could be matched and overmatched again and again .

		There is of course a good side to this glorification of a group .


New England	LOCATION	in its best days was loyal to instincts of locality .

		It backed and cheered its intellectual athletes on , and the spirited runners felt the stimulus and sprang forward to win the prizes .


New York	LOCATION	deserves credit for taking care of its own .

		It reminds me of a story which my father used to tell , of a visit he paid with a companion to a friend 's country house .

		The owner of the property had an idiot son ; and my father , introducing his friend , said .

		`` This is Mr.
Satterthwaite	PERSON	,
Sammy	PERSON	.

		He is a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Quakers , you know , are good people . ''

		■ Yes , '' said the idiot , - good to themselves . ''

		It used to be said that no Bostonian could escape hav - ing a statue erected for him ; and
New York	LOCATION	seems moving in the same laudable direction .

		But it can hardly expect that the rest of the country will bow down and worship its totems of a tribe .

		It is hard to conceive just what ideal the makers of this
Academy	ORGANIZATION	had in view , -- just what kind of sheep they deemed acceptable , and just what kind of goats they thought undesirable .

		It includes men of affairs and publicists , but ignores some of our greatest .

		It admits a large number of artists , which is a commendable departure from the practice of the French Academy .

		It allows a number of college presidents , but disallows others as well and widely known .

		It ignores the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, and the Stage .

		Altogether the list is badly balanced and badly selected , and seems to be issued with the imprint of a prominent magazine .

		The inevitable questions in all such cases is , '' What is the Source of Honor ?

		Whose is the authority which confers the stamp of greatness ? ''

		Artists are envious , and the mob profane .

		Even scientists can hardly be trusted to honor their best And a popular vote would be a folly .

		The French Academy was founded at the culminating period of the French monarchy .

		It has gathered traditions to itself and become venerable by age .

		Yet it is questionable whether it has not done more harm by Its log-rolling , its continual rejection of genius for mediocrity , than it has done good by its recognition of noble work .

		Too many great Frenchmen have occupied its forty-first chair , for the world to accept its judgments as final .

		Besides , it was instituted for a definite purpose -- the preservation and promul - gation of the French language .

		It may have kept this language pure , but it has kept it thin .

		The piratical English speech , recklessly despoiling the tombs of antiquity , ravaging all coasts , bringing back booty from the uttermost ends of the earth , has trebled and quadrupled its stock of words and idioms , and acquired a richness and flexibility which fit it for all human uses , and promise to give it the dom - ination of the world .

		If the
French Academy	ORGANIZATION	has failed in its main object -- that of keeping the French language supreme , -- its minor successes in cultivating urbanity and precision will not much count in the long run .

		We talk a great deal about democracy in
America	LOCATION	, but it looks to me as though we were making a quiet , disguised , but determined effort to create an aristoc - racy .

		And quite rightly , in a way .

		We begin to want some tangible evidence of the existence of the best .

		The idea of a society composed of people of achieve - ment and renown begins to appeal to us .

		The move - ment is fluid as yet ; it has not hardened into an official caste , a plutocracy , or a class of all the talents .

		Any effort toward directing this movement in the way of intellectual and spiritual superiority , and away from the worship of mere wealth , is good .

		Coteries and associations with intellectual trend are springing up all over the country .

		A bright woman once told me that she had just had a dream of heaven , and it was exactly like a meeting of the
Contemporary Club	ORGANIZATION	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Possibly she was an enthusiast , but she expressed a feeling of delight in high intercourse which I believe is becoming common .

		One use for an
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	is to furnish a beadroll of distinctions .

		Another purpose it might serve , and which I suppose the French Academy does serve , would be to bring together persons of high and diverse achievements .


England	LOCATION	, however , has managed this business fairly well without an
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her people of position and wealth have , down at least to a late period , recognized their responsibilities toward the intellectual life of the land .

		They have been hungry for celebrities .

		It is impossible to read the English biographies and memoirs of the last hundred years and not note how rich and full has been the intercourse of great men .

		Almost every Englishman of distinction has seemed to know every other of the same class .

		Here and there an isolated artist or man of letters , or a group of revolters , has escaped being caught into the full current , but as a rule the unofficial Academicians `` f
Great Britain	LOCATION	have been invited everywhere .

		The breakfasts of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	and
Monckton Milnes	PERSON	, the dinners of a hundred other hosts , and most of all the country house parties of people of rank , have been clearing-houses for genius .

		When
the History of Civilization	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	is written it will become evident how much has been due to this hospitality .

		Possibly there have been some drawbacks of pa - tronage and caste ; but these have been greatly THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, overweighted by the benefits of acquaintance and interchange of thought , amid delightful surroundings , which has been made possible for intellectual leaders .

		These benefits have not only been a stimulus but a main reward for effort .

		We have had nothing com - parable to this life in
America	LOCATION	.

		Here a man of genius has been expected to be more grateful for a sandwich than an ordinary person would have to be for a year of banquets .

		Genius of any kind is not apt to be gregarious .

		It stalks alone , feeds on its own breast like the Pelican and reproduces itself like the
Phoenix	LOCATION	.

		Only the lure of dainty feminine presences brought it into the precincts of the HQtel de
Rambouillet	LOCATION	, the
Academia Delia Crusca	LOCATION	, or the later French salons .

		And even these did not get the big men .

		Left to itself , genius has always preferred the social life of taverns , coffee-houses , and small clubs .

		The Mermaid , the
Mitre	LOCATION	, Will 's
Coffee House	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's Club , were the Academies of their times .

		They were the nurs - ing places of talent ; in them reputations were made or unmade ; there the intellectual life of the day flowed freest .

		Yet it may be doubted whether in our times a great capital or chief city is a necessary factor in the development of the arts and sciences .

		That it was so of old , is unquestionable .

		Where the king and court were , there was the assemblage of intellect .

		But we have changed all that .

		Weimar , a country village , dominated
Germany	LOCATION	for fifty years ; the
Lake District	LOCATION	and
Edinburgh	LOCATION	cast the rest of
Great Britain	LOCATION	into the shade for half as long .


Victor Hugo	PERSON	in the
Jersey Islands	LOCATION	was a fair counterpoise to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Wagner scorned
Berlin	LOCATION	, and built his throne at
Beireuth	LOCATION	.

		As long as
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	lived , even
London	LOCATION	was in comparison to his hermitage as the low flar - ing confused lights of a seaside resort are beside the high clear flame of a light-house beacon .

		Wherever the great man is , wherever the few good heads are congregated , there is the head of the table .

		And apparently what genius needs is a desert island for ten months in the year , and then a passport to the best life of the world for the remaining two .

		There has lately been launched , also in
New York	LOCATION	, an organization called
The American Civic Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its object is vast , if vague , being nothing less than , in the language of its prospectus , `` An effort to supplement the Government of the people with a civic body representing the combined
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- lect and Conscience of the entire nation . ''

		Its mem - bership is limited to four thousand , and the qualifi - cations seem to be quite elastic .

		Apparently anyone of respectable attainments , who has the necessary enthusiasm and ten dollars , can belong .

		This is certainly being democratic , and everyone his own Academician .

		Strange as it seems , it looks to me as though this rough-and-ready body , if it material - izes , might have the germ of greater usefulness in it than the localized Academy I have been discussing .

		If its
State	ORGANIZATION	chapters could bring together the best minds of their various sections , if a wave of enthu - siasm could be sent through the whole body , some - thing might come of it .

		It would at least make for the acquaintance of people who in various lines of work are trying to do their best .

		It might do for us , in a measure , what the flow and interchange of English social life have done for Englishmen .

		It might teach the politicians that literary men are not necessarily fools , and the clergy that politicians are not inevitably '' crooks . ''

		From such a general un - derstanding among our leaders in all departments , a larger and fuller life might dawn for our country .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The year 's additions to the Library of Con - gress , according to the recently published report of the librarian , amount to 167,677 volumes , besides pamphlet , manuscript , and other material , bringing the total book collection up to 1,702,635 volumes .

		Among the noteworthy accessions is a set of the great Chinese Encyclopaedia , of which we have before made mention in connection with the copy owned by the British Museum and regarded as one of its most valuable possessions .

		The
Washington	LOCATION	set was presented by the Chinese government -- possibly as a slight acknowledgment of American courtesy and fair play in returning the undistributed balance of the Boxer indemnity .

		Among the valu - able manuscripts lately transferred to our national library from various departments of the government are all the applications for public office received during
Washington	LOCATION	's administration , the original accounts and vouchers of his expenses in the Revo - lutionary War , and documents concerning pension claims of soldiers in that war .

		The catalogue cards now so satisfactorily prepared by the library and furnished to more than a thousand other libraries , both at home and abroad , have attained a yearly circulation of about four million cards .

		A method of exchange is in operation whereby a collective or union public library catalogue is being formed , to indicate the contents of all the great libraries of the country .

		Good work , too , is being done in the draw - ing up of library rules and regulations , the Wash - ington code being already adopted by the
Library Association of England	ORGANIZATION	; the desirability of its still further use on the Continent will be discussed next
June	DATE	at the international library congress to be held at
Brussels	LOCATION	.

		A LIBRARY OF BANKING AND CURRENCY , of twenty volumes or more , is to be published during the com - ing year under the auspices of the
National Mone	ORGANIZATION	- tary
Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and efforts will be made to give the volumes a large circulation throughout the coun - try .

		The government will be the publisher , and it is hoped that the books can be distributed by the superintendent of documents at a moderate price .

		Private purchasers may be few enough , but public and semi-public libraries will be interested in secur - ing sets of these authoritative works , which will ,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL collectively , give a full history and description of the monetary and banking systems of the world .

		Representatives of the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	have for some time been collecting material and holding interviews with finance ministers and leading bankers in various countries .

		The services of the foremost authorities in the many departments into which the general subject divides itself have been secured .

		In the matter of Japanese banking , for example , a theme of especial interest in view of
Japan	LOCATION	's rapid financial development in the last forty years , papers have been expressly prepared by
Marquis Katsura	PERSON	, Pre - mier and
Minister of Finance	ORGANIZATION	, by
Baron Sakatani	PERSON	, ex-Minister of
Finance	ORGANIZATION	, and by
Baron Takahashi	PERSON	, vice-governor of the
Bank of Japan	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is at present unusual interest here in the question of banking , and the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	expresses the hope that business men and students of finance will study the volumes and cooperate in devising for this country a more adequate banking system .

		A QUEER SCHEME OF LITERARY CENSORSHIP has been agitating the book world of
England	LOCATION	.

		The circulating libraries wish to decide on the morality or immorality of a book before it shall be formally turned over to the book-buying and book-reading public .

		If approved by the circulating libraries , through some examining board appointed by them , the book would enjoy the patronage of those com - mercially important institutions .

		If disapproved on the score of immorality , what an advertisement the book would thereby receive !

		The plan is too obvi - ously objectionable , not to say absurd , on many accounts , to be taken seriously -- more ridiculous even than the much-criticised puritanic committee of fiction-sifters voluntarily undertaking to decide what novels are good enough for the
Boston Public Lib	ORGANIZATION	- rary .

		It is no wonder that the English Society of Authors is strongly opposed to the scheme , and that a leading
London	LOCATION	journal pronounces it '' incom - parably more deadly '' than the theatrical censorship which has stirred up so much opposition in
England	LOCATION	.

		The interesting situation is discussed more fully by
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	correspondent in this issue .

		The perils of precocity in a popular writer are grave .

		Having early made his mark and familiar - ized the public with his juvenile genius , can he per - suade his readers to accept riper and worthier and it may be heavier work at his hands ?

		Will Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, for example , find himself forced to con - tinue writing Chestertonese for the next thirty or forty years , or will he be able to drop the journal - istic cock-sureness and epigrammatic smartness that have so well served him thus far ?

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, a somewhat older writer , is one whose later work , whatever its excellence , seems to suffer by comparison with those first fine flights of his imag - ination before the cares of his country weighed on his mind and prompted him to produce rhymed homilies on imperialism .

		Another early successful author is Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	, from whose pen we are not getting many new books of late .

		Is it possible that he has described his own fate in '' The Altar Fire , '' and that his pen , once so fertile , has written itself out ?

		And yet Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is still several years under fifty .

		It is to be hoped that he is simply resting and ripening for yet worthier achievements in literature .

		To be handicapped by youthful fame is worse than to be muffled in a not easily penetrable obscurity .

		The singular usage of some Latin plurals invites passing comment .

		A current paragraph , in a newspaper standing at or near the head of the list for acknowledged literary excellence , runs as follows : '' '
Cook	PERSON	's data turned over , ' says a head - line , referring to the delivery of the stuff to the
Copenhagen	LOCATION	scientists .

		The next thing will be to turn it inside out .

		Was there ever any ' data ' that was so mercilessly criticised as this will be ?

		The examination of
Peary	PERSON	's records was like an afternoon tea in comparison . ''

		No fewer than four times does the writer of this short paragragh proclaim the rusti - ness of his Latin .

		We have long been accustomed , though not wholly reconciled , to the misuse of '' stamina '' as a singular noun . ''

		His stamina was inadequate to the strain put upon it '' might now be read in one 's morning journal without robbing the entire day of its enjoyment ; but '' the data was '' still jars one rather painfully .

		Miss LagerlQf , now entering on

		FROM LITERARY
LONDON	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		The two things that are most interesting the En - glish public since I last wrote are , first , the attempt to purify our literature through a censorship emanat - ing from what are called subscription libraries ; and , second , the question of an
Academy of Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first question has arisen in part , no doubt , from genuine remonstrances having been made to these libraries in behalf of parents who think that their children are taking out books that are very bad for them .

		The whole problem is a difficult one .

		On the one hand , one does not see that any censorship , especially one coming from the cir - culating libraries , which in this country are very keen commercial affairs , on a basis of private ownership , would be other than detrimental to good literature .

		Four of our great circulating libraries , having an enormous business -- not only in this country but in some cases all over the world , -- although rivals in everything else , have joined themselves together into a sympathetic union over this question .

		First , there is
Mudie	PERSON	's , a splendidly managed library , founded by the late Mr.
Charles Edward Mudie	PERSON	, and now a flourishing company .

		In one department of this great business you may see huge boxes packed with books to go to
India	LOCATION	and the British Colonies .

		These boxes are sent to and fro as systematically as if it were only across the road .

		Naturally , considerable control is exercised by the library as to the books distributed in this way .

		The next firm is
W. H. Smith & Sons	ORGANIZATION	.

		This company once had at its head Mr.
W. H. Smith	PERSON	, who held important posts in sev - eral Conservative Governments .

		The third of these firms is known as Boot 's Book-Lovers Library .

		Mr.
Boot	PERSON	was made a knight the other day , and is now Sir
Jesse Boot	PERSON	.

		He has chemist shops all over
London	LOCATION	, and the happy idea came to him of adding book-lending to medicine-vending ; and there is no doubt that the plan has proved a great success .

		The fourth of these book firms is known as
The Times Book Club	ORGANIZATION	, a concern already known to American readers through the big fight that raged between '' The Times '' newspaper and the book publishers when this club was founded , the dispute being over the right of the club to sell the new books that it had purchased at second-hand prices without a certain interval intervening , -- a plan obviously disastrous to the booksellers .

		These four firms have made the proposal to the book publishers that time should be given to the libra - rians to examine books before they are taken by the libraries , with the view of discovering if they contain anything either '' scandalous , '' '' libellous , '' or '' im - moral . ''

		The
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	promptly fell into line with this idea ; which shows .

		that certain publishers are evidently not connected with that Association -- presumably the publishers of
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL the books aimed at .

		The
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, however , desired to consult the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, an organization which undoubtedly has the majority of English authors among its members .

		The
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, at their meeting held to discuss the matter , declared that the libraries obviously had the power already to select what books they willed for their customers .

		The Society declined , however , to accept the condition that the books of their authors should be submitted to any committee of librarians , and indeed described the claim of the libraries as unwarrantable .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	wrote a very sensible letter to '' The Times '' in which he condemned this attempt at censorship on the part of what would be a secret or irresponsible committee .

		He incidentally declared that in their day
Darwin	PERSON	's books would have been impossible under such conditions .

		Where - upon Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	wrote to u The Times '' to say that , as the publisher of
Darwin	PERSON	's books , he did not think that such works as the '' Origin of Species '' would have been in any danger .

		Mr.
Murray	PERSON	has a short memory .

		I recall the days when , in this country at least ,
Darwin	PERSON	's books were looked upon by more than half the community as emanating direct from hell .

		I recall that Mr.
Mudie	PERSON	, the founder of the Library bearing his name , was a very strong dissenter , who would gladly have burnt
Darwin	PERSON	and all his works .

		But Mr.
Mudie	PERSON	was also a shrewd business man .

		and could not have acted with - out the cooperation of his competitors .

		My own strong feeling regarding the proposed censorship is that the remedy is to be found in the newspapers and not in the libraries .

		The call for novels is largely based upon reviews , and if a paper denounces any given book as immoral it is sure to have a great sale .

		It is not the favorable reviews , but the unfavorable , that sell a book , at least in this country .

		The condemnation of the libraries would serve as an additional advertisement of a bad book .

		However , we shall await the result of the struggle with no small interest .

		That some horrid books are now being issued here , is undeniable .

		We have also had considerable discussion of the question of a
National Academy of Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		For ages past , English men of letters have hankered after such an institution as they have in
France	LOCATION	.


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	made great fun of the idea in a very clever essay , and it seemed to have quite ceased to be considered .

		Meanwhile , however , some clever men in the realms of non-imaginative literature have formed an Academy among themselves , which con - tains some of our ablest writers , -- the British Ambassador to
America	LOCATION	, for example .

		It is devoted purely to the work of the student , and not to that of the writer who writes because he must , -- that is to say .

		the imaginative artist .

		The Society calling itself the
British Academy	ORGANIZATION	has a very energetic secretary in Mr.
Israel Gollancz	PERSON	, and has been taking the lead in directions in which I for one can not see that it has any clear authority .

		It organized , for exam - ple , the
Milton Celebration	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	; it organized the
Tennyson Centenary	PERSON	, and it took in hand the whole arrangements of a funeral service to
George Meredith	PERSON	in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	.

		These activities have awakened a spirit of revolt among our men of letters , -- that is to say , among imaginative writers .

		They assert that a Society which does not admit any of their number into its ranks has no right to assume functions of this character .

		Tennyson could not have been a member of it ;
Meredith	PERSON	was not a member .

		Yet the
Society	ORGANIZATION	arrogated to itself the task of commemorating these very men .

		The Society might perhaps justify itself by saying that it only does what there is no one else to do .

		But the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	clearly thinks that such things are the especial business of that body .

		There is no doubt that the Society does number among its sub - scribers a majority of our English writers .

		Yet one feels that its membership is made up almost too indiscriminately .

		Perhaps the ideal
Academy	ORGANIZATION	would be made by a selection of forty of the most brilliant imaginative writers of the day .

		But who is to make the selection ?

		The popular verdict could hardly be trusted .

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, for example , might be elected a member of such an
Academy	ORGANIZATION	, because he has thousands of readers , although his books are quite remote from literature .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	demands that the Society of Authors should con - sider the question ; but I doubt very much if that would be the best method .

		It is rather the a critics '' of authors than the authors themselves who should have the power of selection ; and to that the authors would never submit .

		Altogether , I do not imagine that a
National Academy of Literature	ORGANIZATION	is likely to be established in
London	LOCATION	for many a year to come .

		In a recent letter I referred to the
Johnson Club	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	.

		I have just come away from a dinner which took place on the anniversary of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's death , and on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	's existence .

		The Club numbers only about thirty members , but its membership has been a very interesting one .

		Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	, for exam - ple , has been an enthusiastic supporter from the beginning , although his duties as a Minister of the ; Crown have kept him away of late .

		Sir
Henry M. Stanley	PERSON	, the well-known African explorer , was a member ; Dr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	, who edited the best edition of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's
Johnson	PERSON	that has ever been pub - lished , was a very regular attendant .

		Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	was a member for some years , until , in fact , ; he ceased to go out at night .

		Each member takes !

		his turn in being what is called the '' Prior '' of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		A quite recent Prior was Mr.
H. B. Wheatley	PERSON	, who has written some important books on
London	LOCATION	, and is the editor , preeminently , of
Pepys	PERSON	's Diary .

		The Prior for this year is Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	, ' the author of a book called u The Age of
Johnson	PERSON	, '' and one of the ablest of the reviewing staff of the t
London	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		Among the visitors to the Club | for the evening were Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	,
Canon	ORGANIZATION	10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	,
Beeching	LOCATION	, and Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	.

		Anthony Hope we all know as a popular novelist ; he is also an excellent after-dinner speaker .

		Canon Beeching , who is a canon of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, is one of the few men of to-day who are keeping alive the literary traditions of that church which were so pronounced when we had Dean
Stanley	PERSON	and
Dean Church	ORGANIZATION	, to say nothing of Dr.
Merivale	PERSON	and
Bishop Creighton	PERSON	.

		It might almost be said that
Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	was the last of the literary clergymen of
England	LOCATION	; for
Canon Beeching	ORGANIZATION	, with considerable critical gifts , is but little known to the reading public .

		The third of our guests , Professor
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, is the son of an eminent Nonconformist Minister , Dr.
Alexander Raleigh	PERSON	; he now holds the chair of English Literature at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and has written books on
Milton	LOCATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	that have attracted much attention .

		But perhaps I have said too much about the
John	PERSON	- son
Club	ORGANIZATION	and its pleasant gatherings .

		We meet only three times a year ; a paper is read and dis - cussed , and we drink in silence to the memory of '' the Master . ''

		The event of the week in which I am writing is the publication of the `` Jubilee Number '' of the ''
Cornhill Magazine	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The '' Cornhill '' has existed for fifty years .

		Thackeray was its first editor ; its other editors have included Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, Mr.
Frederick Greenwood	PERSON	, and Mr.
James Payn	PERSON	.

		I rather fancy that Mr.
Greenwood	PERSON	had some difference of opinion with the publishers of the magazine ,
Messrs. Smith & Elder	ORGANIZATION	, and hence his name is strangely ignored in the volley of congratulations contained in this `` Jubilee Number . ''

		Mr.
Stanley Weyman	PERSON	writes about James Payn ; Mr.
W. E. Norris	PERSON	writes about Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	; while
Lady Ritchie	PERSON	, the daughter of
Thackeray	PERSON	, writes about her father .

		There is a poem by
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	that has distinct charm .

		Altogether , the '' Cornhill '' jubilee is a very notable celebration , because magazines that love to publish literature are becoming more and more uncommon in
England	LOCATION	.

		There is a very marked deterioration in this field .

		Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	once had a nice magazine , with good literary matter in it , called `` Murray 's Magazine . ''

		Our other old - time firm , the Longmans , had a magazine called ''
Longman	PERSON	's Magazine , '' which also published much good literatui'e .

		The
Macmillans	ORGANIZATION	issued a magazine which they called after their name , that had equal merits .

		All three are dead . ''

		Blackwood 's '' and '' Cornhill '' alone survive of all the magazines run by high-class publishers aiming to provide good readable material of the best quality ; and I do not believe that either of these has a very large sale .

		Thackeray boasted of a hundred thousand copies of the earlier numbers of '' Cornhill . ''

		I am afraid your readers would be astonished if they heard the present-day sales .

		The fact undoubtedly is that literary taste in this country seems to have dete -

		THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND SPELLING REFORM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The pith of Professor
Paul Shorey	PERSON	's courteous letter in The Dial of
December 1	DATE	is to be found in his assertion that the amelioration of our spelling can not be confided solely to profest scholars , learned in the history of English , because it '' involves many nice questions of taste , literary feeling , psychology of education , and practical consequences , in the de - cision of which the judgments of all thoughtful men , whatever their specialties , are entitled to considera - tion . ''

		And with this assertion no friend of a more logical orthography has any desire to quarrel .

		By an interesting coincidence , the same number of The Dial contained an account of the organiza - tion of an
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , having now forty-five living members .

		In this article the declaration is made that '' the collective distinction of the list is deeply impressive , '' and that it is '' clearly representative of what is best in our intellectual and artistic life . ''

		Probably the writer of that article would be ready to admit that men who have been elected to the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters ought to be specially qualified to deal with what Professor
Shorey	PERSON	has aptly de - scribed as '' nice questions of taste '' and of '' literary feeling . ''

		It may , therefore , be interesting to have it pointed out that six members of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	are also members of the
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	-- Messrs.
Clemens	PERSON	,
Higginson	PERSON	,
Lounsbury	PERSON	,
Matthews	PERSON	,
Roosevelt	LOCATION	, and White .

		Three other members of the Academy are on record as sympathizing heartily with the effort to better our orthography , -- Messrs.
Burroughs	PERSON	, Cable , and Ho wells .

		This has an obvious significance upon which there is no need to expand .

		But what is almost as significant is the fact that at most only one of the twenty other men of letters in this carefully selected group of leaders in the several arts , -- only Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	, -- has publicly ex - prest his opposition to the progressive simplifying of our spelling .

		Of course , it may be quite possible that there are others among this silent score of Amer - ican authors who do not approve of the movement .

		But if any such there are , they have seen fit to keep their opinions to themselves , for whatever reason .

		On the other hand , those members of the
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	who believe that something ought to be done now to make our noble tongue fitter for service thruout the world have not hesitated to stand forward to testify to the faith that is in them .

		Professor
Shorey	PERSON	does not say in so many words that scholarship in English is a disqualification for advocacy of spelling reform ; but he seems to be on the verge of insinuating this .

		That Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	is tainted by this disqualification , can not be denied ; but it does not attach to Messrs.

		A LOCALIZED AMERICAN ACADEMY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		It is easy to see that an
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , as outlined in your issue of
Novem	DATE	- ber 1 , may be a useful and authoritative institution , and a vital force in the upbuilding of our higher national life .

		But tbere are phases of it that call for thoughtful consideration .

		It is hard to see how an institution representing one locality , however meritorious it may be , can properly be regarded as a national Academy .

		It is true that for such an institution the best men should be chosen , wherever found ; and it may be that the promoters of the Academy have had this principle in mind .

		If so , their minds afford subject for interesting inquiry .

		Culture , the pursuit of arts and letters , are commonly believed to tend toward a broadening of view , a correcting of what is narrow and provincial ; yet the proverbial inability of
New York	LOCATION	to see beyond the
Hudson River	LOCATION	, its naive unconsciousness of the rest of the country , have seldom been more signally displayed .

		An inspection of the list of names of the new Academicians , as given in The Dial article already referred to , shows that of the sixty-two members about forty -LRB- two-thirds of the total membership -RRB- are of
New York	LOCATION	; while of the remaining third ,
Boston	LOCATION	and vicinity have fourteen .

		Of the eight remain - ing ,
Baltimore	LOCATION	has two ,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	two ,
Wash	LOCATION	- ington two , and far-off
Georgia	LOCATION	has one for her beloved '' Uncle Remus . ''

		One membership is thus left for all that is '' American '' beyond the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	seaboard ; and this -LRB- under the circumstances -RRB- rather overwhelming honor goes to Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	of
California	LOCATION	, a man far greater than any distinction like this could make him , but distinguished in science and exploration rather than in arts and letters .

		Now my present purpose is not to complain of all this -- not to show the suitability of any of the scholars or artists or men of letters in the vast and influential region thus excluded from the ken of culture in the
East	LOCATION	, or to urge the representation of any of the great universities of the West or the
Pacific Slope	LOCATION	, -- but only to call attention to the facts of the case , leaving others to ponder their sig - nificance and to consider whether an '' American '' Academy can be established on a basis such as is here disclosed .

		THE ORIGIN OF '' OLD GRIMES . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		It is so seldom one finds The Dial napping that I am tempted to express my surprise at the note on '' Old Grimes '' in the last issue .

		The statements that the origin of the song '' is now revealed in Mr.
Dwight C. Kilbourn	PERSON	's ' History of the Bench and Bar of
Litchfield County	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, ' '' and `` The authorship of the song is now traced to a source sufficiently distinguished , '' are made as if they an - nounced a new discovery .

		As a matter of fact , the authorship of the poem has always , I think , been generally known .

		Both
Duyckinck	PERSON	's '' Cyclopedia of American Literature '' and
Griswold	PERSON	's '' Poets and Poetry of
America	LOCATION	'' discuss the work of the Honorable
Albert G. Greene	PERSON	-LRB- not
Green	ORGANIZATION	, as The Dial gives it -RRB- , and print among their samples of his poetry '' Old
Grimes	PERSON	, '' and that other favorite of the earlier school-readers , '' The

		O'er a low couch the setting sun had thrown its latest ray , Where in his last strong agony a dying warrior lay , The stern old
Baron Rudiger	PERSON	.

		... '' Several of the more recent handbooks of American literature also perpetuate the memory of '' Old Grimes '' and its author .

		In '' Book Notes '' for
May 30 , 1908	DATE	, Mr.
Sidney S. Rider	PERSON	, of
Providence	LOCATION	, gives two versions of the poem , and reprints an interesting letter from
Greene	PERSON	, who says : '' It was first published , I think , in
1823	DATE	, in one of the
Providence	LOCATION	papers , for which purpose a copy had been requested of me by the editor .

		In reply to your question respecting the authorship of the stanzas , I answer that the first verse , for aught I know to the contrary , may have been repeated and sung from time immemorial .

		Whether it formed part of some earlier production now for - gotten , or was one of those fragments of verse of which no one can tell the origin or author , I know not .

		That verse was used as a file-leader for the remainder .

		... I need only add that , with the exception of the first , every line of them was written by myself . ''

		Some Evolution House-cleaning .

		* The purpose of all scientific investigation is to learn as much as possible about natural phenomena , in order that man may order his life to the best advantage with reference to these phenomena .

		In carrying out this purpose , science sets before itself the ideal of dealing only with verifiable truth .

		But in the develop - ment of the actual intellectual machinery of investigation -LRB- hypotheses , theories , and the like -RRB- it results not infrequently that this ideal gets put to one side and for the time being forgotten .

		Under such circumstances , a great deal of so - called scientific endeavor and speculation comes to deal with '' things as they might be '' rather than with '' things as they are . ''

		Nowhere has this been more truly the case than in the study of Organic Evolution .

		Darwin and
Wallace	PERSON	showed at the outstart how the selection idea might account for many of the observed phenomena of organic nature , and brought forward definite and cogent evi - dence that selection had really acted to produce certain of these results .

		This idea of selection developed quickly into certain set formulae , and much -- indeed , most -- of the speculation and writing on Evolution up to the present time has concerned itself with the discussion of the prob - able results of the application of these formulae to organisms and conditions as they might con - ceivably be .

		Thus , the brilliant coloring of certain butterflies has been '' explained '' as warn - ing coloration , developed by the action of natural selection , to show the birds that prey on butter - flies that these particular kinds were not whole - some or palatable , and had therefore better be left strictly alone .

		Volumes have been written on this subject , and detailed phases of it have called forth as heated discussion as ever did the famous Theory of Tittlebats .

		Yet practically no one ever took the trouble , or even thought it worth while , to see whether , as a matter of fact , birds do really prey on butterflies to any extent , and whether the effect of the brilliant coloration actually is as it is theoretically sup - posed to be .

		A periodical house-cleaning is just as neces - sary and just as disagreeable intellectually as it is physically or morally .

		On the whole , these gentlemen make very effi - cient '' help '' ; they have done their work unusu - ally well . ''

		The Making of Species '' frankly has as its aim the destructive criticism of Neo-Darwinism , -- or , as the authors rather curiously prefer to designate this school of thought , '' Wallaceism . ''

		In particular , the attempt is made to show that the
Allmacht of Natural Selection	ORGANIZATION	, which is the keynote of the Neo-Darwinism position , is in very large degree fanciful rather than real ; that it depends on metaphysical speculation rather than on the actual observation of living plants and animals under natural conditions .

		The method of the book is to bring forward an array of concrete facts observed by the authors them - selves in their ornithological studies , or cited from the literature , and then to show that these facts can not be accounted for by certain exist - ing theories of the method of evolution without straining logic and credulity to an absurd de - gree .

		The authors ' standpoint and way of pro- ceeding are refreshingly Darwinian . ''

		Like
Darwin	PERSON	, we welcome all factors which appear to be capable of affecting Evolution .

		We have no axe to grind in the shape of a pet hypothesis , and conse - quently our passions are not aroused when men come forward with new ideas seemingly opposed to some which already occupy the field .

		We recognize the extreme complexity of the problems that confront us .

		We look facts in the face and decline to ignore any , no matter how ill they fit in with existing theories .

		We recognize the strength and the weakness of the Dar - winian theory . ''

		The first two chapters are introductory and historical , dealing with the rise and development of the theory of
Natural Selection	ORGANIZATION	and with some of the more important criticisms that have been directed against it during the last fifty years .

		The next three chapters , on '' Variation , '' '' Hybridism , '' and '' Inheritance , '' contain keen critical discussions of a number of problems and lines of work in the foreground of interest and attention to-day .

		DeVries 's mutation theory , as a general theory of evolution , is criticised , al - though the great value of his experimental inves - tigations is fully recognized .

		The discussions of hybridism and inheritance are excellent .

		A wealth of material regarding hybrids amongst wild forms is presented ; nothing could show more convincingly how greatly the importance and generality of the Mendelian principles of
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTAL 13 heredity is exaggerated by some of the more active and zealous investigators in that field .

		The next two chapters deal with two of the pet theories dearest to the heart of the orthodox Neo - Darwinian ; namely , protective and warning coloration and mimicry on the one hand , and sexual selection on the other hand .

		The criti - cisms are sharp and convincing .

		There can be no doubt that much of the post-Darwinian re - finement and extension of theory and speculation on these subjects is utter nonsense , having no relation whatever to the real facts of Nature .

		The last chapter gives a very clear and excel - lent exposition of the factors -LRB- and their relative importance and limitations -RRB- now known to in - fluence evolution .

		The authors point out , with entire correctness and justice , that '' The real problem is the cause of variations ; or , in other words , how species originate .

		At present our knowledge of the causes of variation and muta - tion is practically nil ... The future of biology is largely in the hands of the practical breeder . ''

		The worst that can be said of this extremely interesting and stimulating book is that the authors weaken the presentation of their case by the adoption of an unfortunate style of expres - sion .

		The book was written in a very short time , considering the range and importance of the topics treated , and its tone throughout is rather flippant .

		It is certain that a more tactful presentation of the criticisms and evidence would have gained for the book much more respectful and immediate consideration by professional biologists .

		In its earnestness , the diction occa - sionally gets amusingly turgid .

		Thus , the fol - lowing sentence , in its mixture of desperate earnestness and foozled grammar , reminds one of nothing so much as of the small boy who chokes and swallows as he tries to state an im - portant matter with all the force that he can command : '' We are endeavoring to save biology in
England	LOCATION	from committing suicide , to save it from the hands of those into which it has fallen . ''

Survey of American Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		* As its title indicates , the '' Manual of Amer - ican Literature , '' by Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	, in collaboration with members of the
Faculty of Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, is a compendium of material for reference rather than a history of literary A Man-cal of American - Literature .

		development .

		For more reasons than one , the volume awakens interest .

		It is M No. 4000 '' of the Tauchnitz Editions , a '' memorial volume '' in the well-known Collection of British Authors which , instituted by
Baron Tauchnitz	PERSON	in
1841	DATE	, has now reached the proportions indicated by the number of this issue .

		Its significance as a '' memorial volume , '' in thus marking a notable turning-point in the enlargement of the series , is emphasized by the fact that '' No.
2000	DATE	'' took the form of a volume by Henry
Morley	PERSON	upon '' English Literature in the Reign of Victoria . ''

		No account of literature in
America	LOCATION	has hitherto appeared in the Collection .

		The Manual is dedicated '' to President
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	. ''

		The distinctive feature of the work is the plan of arrangement , which presents the nineteenth - century literature in six divisions under the headings , The Historians , The Novelists , The Poets , The Essayists and the Humorists , The Orators and the Divines , and The Scientists ; a seventh section is given to the Periodicals .

		There are obvious advantages in such a plan , and obvious disadvantages .

		It is adhered to rigidly , not only in cases like those of
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	, who are consequently '' split '' into essayists and poets , but also with
Irving , Poe	PERSON	, and
Holmes	PERSON	, who , like a certain noted actress on a well-remembered occasion , are here com - pelled to appear in three parts .

		The awkward - ness of such an appearance is perhaps less note - worthy than the danger of disproportionate and inconsistent treatment .

		Take
Lowell	PERSON	, for ex - ample : the scant single page which barely gives the titles of his prose essays is painfully inade - quate , and altogether out of proportion when compared with the seven and a half pages given to
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	in the chapter on the Poets , even when we note that all biographical data is pre - sented in this latter section .

		In Irving 's case there is considerable repetition in two of the three divisions ; in fact the '' Knickerbocker History '' is successively described as history , fiction , and humorous essay , -- which may be altogether proper : but there is something like contradiction in the description of the '' Life of
Washington	LOCATION	'' as `` monumental '' by one writer , and as `` the task - work of his declining years '' by another .

		However , this is said not so much by way of criticism as in illustrating the difficulties that attend this method of presentation .

		As a mat - ter of fact , we think that the authors have kept well together ; they have met the difficulties with a degree of success impossible had they not been in constant and close touch with one another .

		The work is distinctively a product of Cornell 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, scholarship .

		Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	is a graduate of that university , and his associates are members of its faculty .

		This kindred in authorship includes yet more ; for the two sections dealing with Colonial Literature and
The Revolutionary Period	ORGANIZATION	are an abridgment of the masterly work of the late
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	, formerly a pro- fessor at
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was not only gracefully appropriate thus to join the distinguished name of another Cornellian with the group , but em - inently wise and just ; for certainly no summary of those periods in our literary history can ever stand except on the foundation of Tyler 's work .

		The largest section in the Manual is that upon the Novelists , by Professor
Clark S. Northup	PERSON	.

		It is also the most interesting .

		More than a quarter of the volume is here included , and the list , which begins with
Charles Brockden Brown	PERSON	, comprises a hundred and eighty names ; yet Professor
Northup	PERSON	is discriminating and concise in his commentary .

		In view of the great and rapid growth of fiction in this generation , it is surprising to note that one of the earliest of American novels , the crude and sentimental '' Charlotte Temple '' -LRB- 1790 -RRB- , has survived its century of life through more than a hundred editions , its last appearance having been in
1905	DATE	.

		In his account of the beginnings , Mr.
Northup	PERSON	does not include
Sarah Morton	PERSON	's '' Power of Sympathy '' -LRB-
1789	DATE	-RRB- , which sometimes figures as the first American novel , although sup - pressed previous to publication .

		The much - discussed authorship of two conspicuously suc - cessful American novels is definitely settled in these pages .

		It is announced authoritatively that Professor
Henry Adams	PERSON	, the historian , is the author of '' Democracy '' -LRB- 1880 -RRB- , and that
John Hay	PERSON	wrote `` The Bread - Winners '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- .

		In the remaining divisions of the book we have the Historians , presented by Dr.
Isaac Madison Bentley	PERSON	; the Essayists and the Humorists , by Professor
Elmer James Bailey	PERSON	.

		The section on the Poets , and that on the Orators and the
Divines	LOCATION	, are by Professor
Lane Cooper	PERSON	.

		Pro- fessor
Northup	ORGANIZATION	provides the section on the Scientists , and that on the Periodicals .

		The latter is , necessarily , much condensed , and will doubtless seem meagre to American readers .

		It must give The Dial a feeling of loneliness to find that it is about the only Western periodical of which Professor
Northup	PERSON	is aware .

		Had he consulted Mr.
Herbert Fleming	PERSON	's very complete monograph on this subject -LRB- published by the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , this section would prob - ably have been considerably expanded .


W. E. Simonds	PERSON	.

		Greek Culture axd
Modern Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		* If experience qualifies one to give counsel , the cause of Greek studies would look far to find two better fitted advocates than the authors of the two volumes before us .

		Each has devoted to that cause more than half a century of un - broken activity , and each has been peculiarly successful in brhiging his own life into vital contact with the deepest currents of Greek life which have come down to us through the souls of men , as well as with the more external remainders of Greek civilization .

		The three chapters of Professor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	's little volume entitled '' Hellas and
Hesperia	LOCATION	'' were delivered as lectures before
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, on the Barbour-Page foundation .

		An old man thus returning to the home of his scholastic youth must naturally be less formal than under other circumstances ; and this fact gives to his words a personal touch which can only enhance their value to those who have been fortunate enough to know him , though it may result in some disappointment to persons who open the volume in search of so thorough and logical a defence of Greek studies as a man of the author 's attainments might present .

		As to a formal plea for Greek , he begs to be excused . ''

		If the study is doomed , let it die .

		Living is the test of vitality .

		... If classical culture has outlived its usefulness ; if its teachers are squeaking and gibbering ghosts and not real men , let in the light , turn on the current and have done with it . ''

		One recalls the spirited words put into the mouth of the aged Cato by Cicero : '' That is a wretched old age indeed which must defend itself by argument . ''

		The '' cubic contents '' of Greek studies , Professor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	reminds us , are greater now than in past generations ; by which he means , of course , that the actual number so engaged is larger than before , in spite of the fact that they do not constitute so large a proportion of the entire body of students and scholars .

		The American , he holds , is essentially the Greek of the modern world . ''

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 pleasure from a first-hand acquaintance there - with .

		Dr.
Gildersleeve	PERSON	's kindly humor , of course , pervades every paragraph .

		That will never depart until pen and tongue are stilled forever .

		Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	's
Lowell Lectures	ORGANIZATION	on • • What Have the Greeks Done for Modern Civilization '' are naturally more formal .

		In various important fields of human effort -- prose and poetry , architecture and sculpture , painting and music , logic , mathematics , medi - cine , politics , law , philosophy , etc. , -- he points out the achievements of the Greeks and the direct or indirect relation of those achievements to modern efforts in the same lines .

		In general , this work is well and carefully done ; but we note a tendency unduly to depreciate the work of the Romans by way of comparison .

		Of course no Latinist denies the general artistic superiority of the Greek , through which he '' took his fierce Roman conqueror captive , '' but that is a very superficial view of the evidence which fails to recognize that the Romans added substantial and valuable qualities of their own to all their borrowings from
Greece	LOCATION	, qualities without which modern life would have lost very heavily in its lessons from the ancient Mediter - ranean civilizations .

		It is not necessary to attempt here any resume of Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	's arguments , since intelligent readers are already aware of the general trend which such a discus - sion must take .

		Perhaps many would be sur - prised to read some of the definite information which he gives as to the extent of Greek achieve - ment in the field of higher mathematics .

		The present writer once heard a famous platform lecturer , the head of an educational institution in an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	city , assert to a body of students in a preparatory school that they knew more of science and mathematics than any of the ancient Greeks and Romans !

		Few , of course , are as ignorant of the facts as that , but not many are aware how far one would have to go to pass the northernmost igloos of a Euclid , an Apollonius of
Perga	LOCATION	, an Hipparchus , or a Diophantus , in the polar latitudes of mathematics .

		The aver - age modern student preparing for such a feat would certainly find it necessary to dispense with many of the customary accoutrements of current college life and load his sledges with a high quality of intellectual pemmican instead .

		In discussing the subject of Greek music , Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	assumes that the idea of Greek educators that the practice of music has a direct and powerful effect upon the morals of average men is entirely foreign to modern thought .

		We have no sufficient acquaintance with modern musical literature to say whether this idea has had any very general discussion , but we have heard it put forth orally too often to believe that it can be as foreign to modern thought as he imagines .

		In fact , when we con - sider how readily certain types of music appeal to certain moods of mind , it would seem an inevi - table conclusion that either elevating or degrad - ing moral effects must be produced by this means under appropriate conditions .

		Who does not know how readily , in the field of church music , almost an entire audience may be jarred out of a spiritual frame of mind by some misplaced effort of organist or choir ?

		Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	is too plain-speaking a man to be insincere in his assertion that he found during his visit to
America	LOCATION	a far more hopeful situation with regard to Greek than he had expected .

		And we are glad that he was not afraid , within such close proximity to
Harvard Square	ORGANIZATION	, to allude to the part of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	itself in making the situation as bad as it is .

		We can do no better in closing than to quote the final sentence of our author 's peroration : '' So now , when my part in the race is nearly run , there remains to me no higher earthly satisfaction than this , that I have carried the torch of Greek fire alight through a long life -- no higher earthly hope than this , that I may pass that torch to others , who in their turn may keep it aflame with greater brilliancy perhaps , but not with more earnest devotion , ' in the Parliament of man , the Federation of the world . ' ''


W. H. Johnson	PERSON	.

		New Revealmexts of
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		* Seldom has the foolishness of prophesying been better illustrated than by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's famous dictum of three decades ago : '' I doubt whether
Shelley	PERSON	's delightful Essays and Letters will not re - sist the wear and tear of time better and finally come to stand higher than his poetry . ''

		Certainly , we welcome gladly a collection of Shelley letters which includes thirty-eight entirely new ones , besides nearly fifty containing hitherto unpublished matter .

		Yet our enthusiasm is mild compared with what we should feel at the announce - ment of an equal number of fresh Shelley poems .

		However , a comparison of this kind is quite unneces - sary ; and we would not belittle what we now have , after eighty-seven years of waiting -- a chronologi - cal and systematic arrangement of material which hitherto it has been necessary to seek through numer - * The Letters of

		With illustrations .

		In two vol - umes .

		New York :

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ous fragmentary and scattered volumes , the whole collection of old and new amounting to about four hundred and eighty letters , or nearly three times as many as any one previous work has contained .

		Moreover , the compact biographical sketches of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's numerous friends and correspondents are of the greatest service in putting the reader en rapport with his environment ; the illustrations are mostly new , and the whole work of editing is admir - ably done .

		Naturally , the volume is richer in biographical than in critical interest .

		Concerning the moods , the motives , the impulses and surroundings that influ - enced the production of special poems ,
Shelley	PERSON	has little to say in these letters .

		But
Mary Shelley	PERSON	's Notes to the early editions of the poems have made these as well known as any such matter can ever be made known to an outsider .

		What we do get , and are heartily glad to get , is considerable light upon two fundamental principles that perpetually chal - lenge discussion in the career of
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		To enter fully into his attitude of mind on these two points is absolutely necessary if anyone is to justify or even endure his course of conduct as a man , however he may be esteemed as a poet .

		These principles were : -LRB- 1 -RRB- Opinion should be absolutely free ; therefore no man should be arraigned by his fellow-men for any opinion .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Resolutely and consistently to act according to his own opinion is the duty of every man , and is the way in which he can best serve his fellow-men .

		To read the group of letters written by
Shelley	PERSON	to his publisher and to other friends in the
last month of the year 1817	DATE	, when a young man of twenty-five , unknown to fame and seeking to get a poem of twelve cantos into print , is to realize the stuff of which he was made . ''

		Laon and Cythna '' -- so the poem was called -- so far outran the bounds of discretion in its utterances , moral , political , and theological , as to terrify the publisher and cause him to threaten to withdraw it after only three copies had been printed .

		Although he had no hope of another publisher ,
Shelley	PERSON	for a long time refused to alter a line of the poem .

		His eloquent letter of protest against the intended injustice of suppressing the book after it had been printed , brought the pub - lisher down to
Marlow	PERSON	; a personal conference resulted in the cancelling of some pages , the altering of others , and the final publication of the poem as '' The Revolt of Islam . ''

		The transaction is brought into high relief by placing the vigorous letters written at this period to different persons side by side , as well as by the addition of one entirely new letter .


Thomas Moore	PERSON	had written kindly and encourag - ingly to the young author , and this was his reply : '' The present edition of '
Laon	LOCATION	and
Cythna	PERSON	' is to be sup - pressed , and it will be republished in about a fortnight under the title of ' The Revolt of Islam , ' with some alterations which consist in little else than the substitution of the words friend and lover for that of brother and sister .

		The truth is that the seclusion of my habits has confined me so much within the circle of my own thoughts that I have formed to myself a very different measure of approbation or disapprobation for actions than that which is in use among mankind ; and the result of that peculiarity , contrary to my intention , re - volts and shocks many who might be inclined to sympathize with me in my general views .

		As soon as I discovered that this effect was produced by the circumstance alluded to , I hastened to cancel it -- not from any personal feeling of terror or repentance , but from the sincere desire of doing all the good and conferring all the pleasure which might flow from so obscure a person as myself .

		I do n't know why I trouble you with these words , but your kind approbation of the opening of the Poem has emboldened me to believe that the account of my motives might interest you . ''

		Five years earlier than this ,
Shelley	PERSON	, at the age of twenty , wrote thus to an unknown correspondent : '' No human being is a member of the community , not as a limb is a member of the body , or as what is part of a ma - chine , intended only to contribute to some general joint re - sult .

		He was created not to be merged in the whole as a drop in the ocean , or as a particle of sand on the sea-shore , and to aid only in comprising a man .

		He is an ultimate be - ing , made for his own perfection as his highest end , made to maintain an individual existence , and to serve others only so far as consists with his own virtue and progress ...
Noth	PERSON	- ing seems to me so needful as to give the mind the conscious - ness -- which governments have done so much to suppress -- of its own separate work .

		Let the individual feel that he is placed in the community not to part with his individual - ity , or to become a tool .

		To me , the progress of society consists in nothing more than in bringing out the individual , in giving him a consciousness of his own being , and in quick - ening him to strengthen and elevate his mind . ''

		No man , I affirm , will serve his fellow-beings so effect - ually , so fervently , as he who is not their slave , -- as he who , casting off every yoke , subjects himself to the law of duty in his own mind .

		For this law enjoins a disinterested and generous spirit .

		Individuality , or moral self-subsistence , is the secret foundation of an all-comprehending love .

		No man so multiplies his bonds with the community as he who watches most jealously over his own perfection .

		There is a beautiful harmony between the good of
the State	ORGANIZATION	and the moral freedom and dignity of the individual .

		Were it not so , were these interests in any case discordant , were an indi - vidual ever called to serve his country by acts debasing his own mind , he ought not to waver a moment as to the good which he should prefer .

		Property , life , he should joyfully surrender to the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		But his soul he must never stain or enslave . ''

		On the great crux of Shelley biography -- his elopement with
Mary Godwin	PERSON	while still in appar - ently friendly relations with his wife
Harriet	PERSON	-- more opportunities than ever before in one place are offered for individual judgment .

		Harriet 's letters to Mrs.
Nugent	PERSON	, soon after the event , are collected in an Appendix ; and we know her view of the case as well as his .

		It becomes , indeed , far less easy to justify
Shelley	PERSON	, or to endorse
Dowden	PERSON	's opinion : '' It is evident that in
May , 1814	DATE	-LRB- the elopement took place in the
July	DATE	following -RRB- ,
Harriet	PERSON	had assumed an attitude of hard alienation towards her husband who pleaded with almost despairing hope for the restoration of her love . ''

		It is true that
Shelley	PERSON	left home and went to
London	LOCATION	about this time ; yet it looks like anything but '' hard alienation '' when we find that there was a continual correspondence kept up , -- that on one occasion , four days having elapsed without a letter from
Shelley	PERSON	,
Harriet	PERSON	wrote an appealing letter to his publisher , saying , '' It seems an age since I heard from him ... If I do not hear from you or from him I shall come to
London	LOCATION	.

		I can not endure this dreadful state of suspense . ''

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 That she never intended to alienate herself from
Shelley	LOCATION	is plain from her pathetic account to Mrs.
Nugent	PERSON	, and the desperate eagerness with which she seeks to shield Shelley by placing the blame elsewhere . ''

		Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	has become profligate and sensual , owing entirely to
Godwin	PERSON	's '
Political Justice	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The very great evil that book has done is not to be told ... He cares not for me now .

		He never asks after me , or sends me word how he is going on ... Oh !

		if you knew what I have suffered , your heart would drop blood for my miseries . ''

		With as much of the evidence before us as we are ever likely to have on the H
Harriet	PERSON	question , '' it seems high time to banish at least one cruel injustice .

		Many of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's biographers have placed the blame of separation on
Harriet	PERSON	's unfaithfulness .

		The evi - dence of this vanishes into less than nothing , since it comes from prejudiced parties : and there is a good deal in disproof .

		Shelley 's only justification , if justi - fication there be .

		must be found in his views of mar - riage , as expressed in '' Queen Mab '' and often in his letters .

		Very early he had become a disciple of
Godwin	PERSON	, and had accepted entirely
Godwin	PERSON	's belief that u The institution of marriage is a system of fraud ... Marriage is a law .

		and the worst of laws . ''

		Shelley greatly desired the union of his friend
Hogg	PERSON	with his beloved sister
Elizabeth	PERSON	; yet he wrote to
Hogg	PERSON	: '' Matrimony .

		I know , is a word dear to you ; does it vibrate in unison with the hidden strings of rapture -- awaken divine anticipation ?

		Is it not the most horrible of all the means which the world has had recourse to , to bind the noble to itself ?

		Yet this is the subject of her constant and printed panegyric .

		It is in vain that I seek to talk to her -LSB-
Elizabeth	PERSON	-RSB- .

		It is in vain that I represent , or rather endeavor to represent , the futility of the world 's opinion . ''

		The last words explain much of
Shelley	PERSON	, and of his conduct , which at least was founded upon conviction .

		The u futility of the world 's opinion '' carried no restraint with him ; if he loved another person more , marriage was no reason for remaining with one less loved .

		In general it may be said of these letters that they do not materially alter our impressions of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		The qualities of decision , promptness of resource and action , of generosity , of self-forgetful interest in others , general kindliness , and courtesy , come out with increased force .

		A new light seems thrown upon him in the capacity of a business man .

		We see him negotiating , transacting , advising , con - trolling , treating the business of life in a business - like way , though not blind to the fact that he was unconscionably '' worked '' by the insatiable
Godwin	PERSON	.

		In one of the last letters he ever wrote , he said : `` I have been long firmly persuaded that all the money advanced to
Godwin	PERSON	, so long as he stands engaged in business , is absolutely thrown away . ''

		Shelley 's religion , or absence of religion , has been so often discussed , his belief in immortality has been so often denied , that we can not refrain from quoting one very explicit statement in a letter dated 1811 : '' Shall we sink into the nothing from which we have arisen ?

		But could we have arisen from nothing ?

		We put an acorn into the ground .

		In process of time it modifies the particles of earth , air , and water , by infinitesimal division , so as to pro- duce an oak .

		That power which makes it to be this oak we may call its vegetative principle , symbolizing with the animal principle , or soul of animated existence .

		An hundred years pass .

		The oak moulders in putrefaction -- it ceases to be what it is ; its soul is gone .

		Is soul then annihilable ?

		Yet one of the properties of animal soul is consciousness of iden - tity .

		If this is destroyed , in consequence the soul -LRB- whose essence this is -RRB- must perish .

		But as I conceive -LRB- and as is certainly capable of demonstration -RRB- that nothing can be an - nihilated , but that everything appertaining to nature , con - sisting of constituent parts infinitely divisible , is in a con - tinual change , then do I suppose -- and I think I have a right to draw this inference -- that neither will soul perish ; that in a future existence it will lose all consciousness of having formerly lived elsewhere , -- will begin life anew , possibly under a shape of which we have now no idea .

		But we have no right to make hypotheses -- this is not one ; at least I flatter myself that I have kept clear of the supposition . '' '

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, to
London	LOCATION	in outraged dignity .

		Taking cheap lodg - ings , she sets ahout '' living her own life '' in fact , and discovers it to he a difficult matter .

		Her ser - vices do not seem to be greatly desired , and she fin - ally borrows forty pounds from an elderly stock - broker with bulging eyes who professes solicitude for her welfare .

		He naturally expects payment after the fashion of his kind ; and this episode leads to a scene in a cabinet particulier which is -- well , we hesitate to say what it is , beyond expressing the opinion that it goes beyond what is legitimate in decent fiction .

		With the borrowed money ,
Ann Veronica	PERSON	pays her fees in the laboratory , and per - sues her studies under the direction of a young biolo - giat named Capes , who has a wife and a shady past .

		She concludes that she is in love with him , and , nothing abashed , tells him so .

		He makes difficulties , still having some sparks of decency in his nature ; but she is determined , and off they go to
Switzer	PERSON	- land .

		Meanwhile ,
Ann Veronica	PERSON	's experience with the stockbroker has aroused an indignation that must find vent somehow , and the thing nearest at hand for
Ann Veronica	PERSON	is to beceme a suffragette , which she does so successfully that she is soon enjoy - ing a fortnight of enforced seclusion from the world .

		Then comes the Swiss escapade with its delirious joys .

		And finally , skipping several years , we are given an epilogue showing the couple living happily together as Mr. and Mrs.
Capes	PERSON	.

		We infer from this that the former Mrs.
Capes	PERSON	has made some sort of an end , although the author delicately refrains from mentioning the fact .

		Capes , who has deserted biology , is now a prosperous dramatist .

		Meeting his father-in-law one day , he introduces himself and invites him to dinner .

		The affair goes off very well , and when their guest has departed ,
Ann Veronica	PERSON	says to her husband : '' To think that is my father !

		Oh , my dear !

		He stood over me like a cliff ; the thought of him nearly turned me aside from everything we have done , He was the social order ; he was law and wisdom .

		And they come here , and they look at our furniture to see if it is good ; and they are not glad , it does not stir them , that at last , at last we can dare to have children . ''

		The modern young woman is a restless creature , no doubt , and Mr.
Wells	PERSON	knows some things about her .

		But if we thought him serious in offering this par - ticular specimen for our approval , we should straight - way , in preference , declare for the young women of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's world .

		They at least recognized something higher than the law of individual impulse .

		But we can not take Mr.
Wells	PERSON	very seriously , or find much more than good fun in his account of
Ann Veronica	LOCATION	.

		We should have to call this his latest story one of the most immoral , if it were not obvi - ously one of the larkiest , of books .

		An instructive contrast to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's audacity of invention is provided by Mr.
A. E. Jacomb	PERSON	's '' The Faith of His Fathers , '' which is also a story of revolt , -- a plea for the claims of the new generation against the crusted prejudices of the old , -- but is conceived in a spirit of sympathy and reverence , not one of scorn and recklessness .

		The revolt which it portrays is a reaction against the drab puritanism which frowns upon all pleasure as sinful , which holds in dark suspicion every natural motion of the human spirit toward light and cheer .

		It is a novel of pro- vincial
England	LOCATION	, dated , we should say , some time ago , although survivals of the austere and dogmatic idealism which supplies its motive may possibly yet be found in out-of-the-way communities .

		Here is a father , a leader of some such narrow sect as the Ply - mouth Brethren , unswervingly conscientious in his own light , who well-nigh ruins the lives of his chil - dren by the sternness of his discipline .

		The son , forced to marry the girl whom he has seduced , drags out a wretched life which ends in crime and a prison sentence .

		The daughter , forbidden to marry the man she loves because he does not accept the tenets of the sect , is made miserable by the interposition of this unreal obstacle in the path of her happiness , and asserts her rights as an individual only at the cost of family estrangement .

		Even the long-suffering wife gives way in the end , and , after a lifetime of self - repression , turns upon her husband , saying , '' I hate you !

		I hate you and your religion ! ''

		But we , seeing with more objective eyes the man who has wrought all this calamity , can not withhold a consider - able measure of sympathy from one who is so sincere , even if so intellectually at fault .

		He stands unshaken , a sort of minor replica of Ibsen 's '' Brand , '' as the moral avalanche for which he is responsible descends upon him , and his uncompromising fortitude makes of him the one heroic figure of the narrative .

		Throughout this conflict of ideals there is always recognized the principle , of which we can find no evidence in the conflict of ''
Ann Veronica	PERSON	, '' that the controlling force in every soberly-ordered life must be something more deserving of respect than the individual will , something that bears a higher mandate than even the most passionate desire for personal happiness .

		The man who forsakes '' the faith of his fathers '' is bound to see to it that the substitute he provides is no less morally effective , and is something more than a mere cloak for self - indulgence .

		The atmosphere of Egyptian life is reproduced for us with quite extraordinary effect by Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	in his latest novel .

		In this respect , a com - parison with Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's efforts , or even with those of Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, is so far in favor of the author of ''
Bella Donna	PERSON	'' as to make such books as `` The White Prophet '' and `` The Weavers '' seem garish and tawdry .

		But we can hardly call it a pleasant tale for which Mr.
Hichens	PERSON	has provided so wonderful a setting .

		A woman whose past is more than dubious , but who has the power to affect injured innocence , is looking about
London	LOCATION	society for a new victim , and finds him in the person of an idealist of quixotic temperament , whose chivalrous instincts are so aroused by the slanders heaped upon her that he asks her to become his wife .

		This is precisely her game ; for her affairs are desperate ,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 19 and he is , besides , an excellent parti , being the pro- spective heir to a title and estates .

		It so happens that his work is in
Egypt	LOCATION	-- a work of agricultural reclamation -- and thither he takes his bride .

		His friends , meanwhile , are aghast at the way in which he has been duped , and one of them , a keen-sighted physician , determines to keep his eyes open .

		The scene now shifts to
Egypt	LOCATION	, where the discomforts of existence makes it hard for the wife to keep up the de - ception of even so credulous a person as her husband .

		When his prospects of a title vanish , she becomes reckless and throws herself into the arms of a native potentate , whose sensual nature matches her own , and who is the possessor of great wealth .

		Keeping up the pretence of wifely devotion , she not only betrays her husband , but sets about getting rid of him by means of poison , slowly and subtly admin - istered .

		His robust health breaks down under the treatment , and he is almost at the point of death when the physician friend -LRB- whose suspicions have become aroused -RRB- , journeys post-haste from the Thames to the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, takes a hand in the plot , rescues the man , and opens his eyes to the doings of the would-be murderess .

		Finally , poetic justice is sat - isfied when the latter flies to her Egyptian lover , only to be spurned by him as a cast-off toy .

		It is not , as we said before , a pleasant story : but it is one of vivid description and characterization , and of marked power to hold the interest .

		Mr.
Albert E. Hancock	PERSON	is the author of ''
Bronson	PERSON	of the Rabble , '' a historical novel of early American life , covering the period from the War of
1812	DATE	to the first election of President
Jackson	PERSON	.

		The hero is a youth of the people -- '' the rabble , '' as it is contemptuously styled in the circles of wealth and breeding -- who distinguishes himself in the Battle of
Lake Erie	LOCATION	, and afterwards becomes a political leader and newspaper editor in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		His story , although not devoid of the private and senti - mental interest which readers have a right to expect , is essentially a portrayal of American life in its formative stage , in the period which witnessed the emergence of democracy from a society that had been mainly controlled by aristocratic ideals and influences .

		The author is almost fiercely partisan in championship of the new spirit then making itself felt , and takes a whack at the Federalists upon every possible occasion .

		He has only words of praise for the war in which
America	LOCATION	took the part of the arch - enemy of liberty , and only scorn for the movement which led to the
Hartford Convention	ORGANIZATION	.

		He carries contempt for
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	to an extreme , and accepts the legend of the ' • corrupt bargain '' whereby
Jackson	PERSON	was defeated in
1824	DATE	.

		The triumph of democracy four years later is the climax of the novel .

		While we think Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	's view unfairly colored by prejudice , we can not deny the vigor and interest of his work , or the unusual char - acter of his historical and antiquarian equipment .

		His book is fairly comparable with the works of his fellow-townsman .

		Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, for knowledge and sound literary workmanship . '

		• My Lady of the South , '' by Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	, provides a sort of complement to '' My Lady of the North , '' by the same novelist .

		Hero and heroine are merely reversed in their sympathies , and other - wise the stock situation is the same .

		It is a situa - tion of perennial interest to American readers , and in the hands of as capable an entertainer as Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	it requires no apology for another treatment .

		The present story is compactly knit , and the entire action covers only a few days , all spent in and around an old
Kentucky	LOCATION	home .

		The heroine is about to be forced into a distasteful marriage , when the hero appears , and , under cover of darkness , passes himself off as the bridegroom , contracting a midnight mar - riage .

		The obvious difficulties of this situation are ingeniously met , and we are prepared for the eclair - cissement and the softening of the young woman 's rebel heart .

		Days of excitement follow , for the house becomes a scene of raids and forays , of excur - sions and alarms , during which both hero and heroine exchange several times the characters of captor and captive .

		There are secret tunnels in which mysterious murders take place , and there is a concealed family maniac to account for these deeds of blood .

		There is also a feud , of which the dramatic possibilities are exploited to exciting effect .

		The story is as good as the best that the author has ever given us .

		The simple and appealing tale of a baby found - ling , whose parentage is at last happily discovered , is told by Mr.
Jay Cady	PERSON	in * ' The Moving of the Waters . ''

		It is a tale of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and the child grows up in the rude house-boat of a wooden - legged fisherman .

		One day she flags a train that is rushing to distraction , and thereby becomes a heroine in the literal sense .

		This brings her into notice , and sets in action the machinery whereby her secret is disclosed .

		It also provides a suitable hero in the person of the young physician who looks after her when she is injured in her life-saving adventure .

		The scene then shifts to
St Louis	LOCATION	, where the threads of the mystery are gradually untangled .

		There are several quaint and lovable characters , besides those already mentioned , and the whole story is delicate in feeling and charming in sentiment Tales of treasure-hunting have a perennial charm .

		The tale called ■ The Treasure , '' which Mr.
Paul W. Eaton	PERSON	has provided for our delectable excitement , is concerned with no less a booty than the pirate hoard of Captain
Kidd	PERSON	, which was buried by the redoubtable buccaneer upon one of the islands in
Casco Bay	LOCATION	.

		The inevitable manuscript provides a clue to the hiding-place , but there is a rival claimant in the person of one of
Kidd	PERSON	's descendants , who has allied himself with an Englishman , a pirate himself , but posing as a British privateersman in the War of
1812	DATE	.

		Thus history is interwoven with romance , and we are regaled , among other matters , with an account of the burning of
Washington	LOCATION	by the British in
1814	DATE	.

		It is a fairly well-written yarn , which brings the villain to a suitable end , and the heroine to her lover 's arms .

		But the treasure , to our regret , goes to the bottom of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, If anything is equal to a good story about pirates and buried treasure , it is a good detective story ; and Mr.
Cleveland Moffett	PERSON	has written one of the best that have come to us in recent years .

		It is a Parisian tale , much after the manner of Gaboriau , and deals with the unmasking of an arch-villain of wealth so enormous that he is able to control the very mach - inery of justice , and thwart the detective-hero at every turn .

		He knows that
Paul Coquenil	PERSON	is the only man whom he has to fear , and attempts , by flattering offers from
South America	LOCATION	, to secure his removal from the scene .

		But
Paul	PERSON	refuses the bait , after nibbling at it , and remains in
Paris	LOCATION	, to the dis - comfiture of the criminal , after the wits of the two have been pitted against each other in a long game of check and countercheck . ''

		Through the Wall '' is the title of this exciting and absorbing tale .

		`` The Silver Horde '' which supplies the motive of Mr.
Rex Beach	PERSON	's latest Alaskan story , is a pic - turesque designation of the salmon that congest the northern rivers at a certain season of the year .

		The hero , who has been down and out for some time , finds new opportunity beckoning to him in the shape of a cannery , and proeeeds to organize a company and lay plans for the acquisition of the fortune that shall win for him the love of the girl to whose service he has long been devoted .

		She is the daughter of a
Chicago	LOCATION	magnate who at just this time is organiz - ing a trust to control all the salmon fisheries of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		This brings the hero and his pro- spective father-in-law into violent collision , and the warfare that follows makes up the substance of the story .

		The hero is successful , of course , after over - coming exaggerated and incredible obstacles , but in the progress of these events his affections are trans - ferred to a young woman of somewhat dubious past , whom he meets in
Alaska	LOCATION	, and whose loyal support and self-sacrifice are the most important factors in his triumph .

		The story is highly-colored melo - drama , violent in action , and with little claim to serious consideration .

		It presents certain phases of the rough Alaskan life with vivid forcefulness , but of the finer graces of fictive art it is wholly innocent .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		A quiet man 's book for quiet people iSSU a pp ears from Mi - E - M -
Martin	PERSON	' s pen under the pleasantly alliterative title , `` Wayside Wisdom '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Availing himself of the intimate essayist 's privilege , the author speaks throughout in the first person singular , and reveals himself with some distinctness to the reader in the end .

		He appears to us as a book-loving book - seller , printing in the back of his house the volumes he sells in the front , -- a disciple of
William Morris	PERSON	, one conjectures , and making a fine art out of what would else be a trade .

		But there is little of book - ishness in his chapters , which deal with such matters as old superstitions , rural life , the advantages of poverty , the smoke of cities , travelling , being in love , the vanity of learning , living alone , growing old , death , and a few others .

		The chapter on `` Some Old Superstitions '' makes the oldest of these to be the superstitions of sound .

		One would have said the visible ghost , the apparition , was older than '' the calling voices . ''

		But who knows ?

		In connection with solitary living , the author quotes from an un - named source : '' Silent men are kings , for they rule over a great country where none can follow them . ''

		But the assertion that follows , a little later , that '' it is a law of our being that we live alone , '' must refer to spiritual solitude , not physical .

		The very first essay , on '' Wayside Wisdom , '' quotes the contempt - uous definition of proverbs -LRB- '' milestones on the pathway of fools '' -RRB- only to dissent from it , very properly .

		The writer 's style is agreeable and fluent .

		On the opening page stands a little example of per - versity that is often met with in current literature .

		Why will writers use '' still less '' for '' still more , '' and vice versa ?

		Here is the sentence : '' There is a grace , even a virtue , in doing nothing ; but so un - accustomed are we to its practice , still less its praise , that at first this very old truth sounds like some new thing . ''

		Six of the essays have already appeared in '' The Gentleman 's Magazine '' -LRB- one of the six being rewritten for the book -RRB- , and the remaining eleven are new .

		Pepys 's Diary will always be the best Old Pepv * ' commentary on its author ; whatever others say can be based only on that most fascinating of self-revealing documents .

		So when Mr.
E. Hallam Moorehouse	PERSON	writes on ''
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	, Administrator , Observer , Gossip '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , he puts before us when he can the
Pepys	PERSON	of the Diary , and when he can not he has to be content with the formal documents consciously prepared for pub - lication .

		The book aims to give the domestic and historical setting in which
Pepys	PERSON	's activity was placed , and in this it forms a useful commentary on the Diary .

		It does not take its place -- no work could do that -- but it forms a very good introduc - tion ; it enables one unfamiliar with the events and persons of the time to read the work itself with greater intelligence .

		The author has caught
Pepys	PERSON	's spirit admirably ; in fact , in his zeal as
Pepys	PERSON	's de - fender he seems to exaggerate the unfavorable criti - cism on the poor sinner , as if we were all Puritans and there were to be no more cakes and ale .

		The charming naivete '' of the man goes far to atone for his embracing
Deb Willet	PERSON	; and surely his repent - ance should cause him to find favor in the sight of the most proper individual , when he could as a light affliction endure
Will Hewer	PERSON	, his wife 's authorized detective , who '' goes up and down with me like a jaylour , but yet with great love and to my good liking it being my desire above all things to please my wife therein . ''

		Mr.
Moorehouse	PERSON	brings out in a very favorable and just light
Pepys	PERSON	's fine admin - istrative ability , his splendid showing before the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE
DIAL 21 House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	, his remarkably effective work as Clerk of the Acts and Secretary of the Admiralty in conducting the affairs of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, drawing for this upon the Diary and official documents .

		And there is , too , the
Pepys	PERSON	of the
Bibliotheca Pepysiana	LOCATION	, that graces and enriches
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cam	LOCATION	- bridge .

		But above all is the inimitable gossip , who prattles about all sorts of persons , from the servant whom he was seen to kick , to his chief whom he righteously reproves and his king of whom he sin - cerely disapproves ; he is introduced to us here that we may go to the Diary to know him as we can know few men , as we hardly dare know ourselves .

		The uhite mans That '' the white man ' S bu .

		rd .

		en '' S * ^ ' burden , and Us is often evident .

		The willingness to galling curse .

		assume it has never been more nota - bly shown than by
Britain	LOCATION	.

		The needs of British trade lie in the direction of the policy of burden - assumption .

		Exploitation and elevation -- at least in theory -- go hand in hand ; and wherever we find the white man taking up his burden and working the lower races for his profit and their welfare , we also find chafing and sores .

		Just now ,
South Africa	LOCATION	pre - sents serious problems .

		What is to be done with the native ?

		How is he to be worked ?

		How is he to be protected ?

		How can he be worked and still protected ?

		To such problems the work on '' South African Natives '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is devoted .

		In
South Africa	LOCATION	are tribes so badly needing elevation that for their uplift
Britain	LOCATION	has taken possession .

		True , the bind offered agricultural opportunity , and mines of gold and dia - monds .

		In assuming the burden , and incidentally getting the land and mines , there has been injustice to the natives : there always is .

		And hence there is the
South African Races Committee	ORGANIZATION	, composed of estimable gentlemen who have some conscience .

		They acquiesce in the necessity of burden-bearing , but desire to reduce the native suffering and the overlord 's injustice to a minimum .

		Their Report discusses such topics as The Labor Question , Land Tenure , Taxation ,
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, Legal Status , Education ,
The Ethiopian Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		The need of a watchful committee is amply demonstrated by the facts presented and the discussion of them .

		Within a few decades the Bantu native , well adapted to and fairly utilizing his environmental resources , has been dispossessed .

		He can no longer gain a living in his own natural and simple fashion ; he must be so man - aged and manipulated as to supply a continuous and usable labor force for mine and farm ; where his fathers were owners , he may no longer hold land , or only under strange and new restraints ; he is subject to heavy taxation , often amounting to coercion to labor for the benefit of aliens -- for his own eleva - tion , of course ; his legal status is uncertain , often disadvantageous ; his education but qualifies him the better to serve his overlords .

		These and many other interesting facts emerge from the careful reading of this Report , which on the whole is optimistic regard - ing the future .

		Not the least interesting chapter deals with `` The Ethiopian Movement . ''

		In the native churches , in the section of population most tolerant of and affected by ameliorative influences , signs of revolt appear .

		Even the Christian natives are becoming restless , and prefer to elevate them - selves rather than to be further elevated .

		Probably the political significance of the '' movement '' has been exaggerated -LRB- as is here claimed -RRB- ; but it is an interesting symptom , encouraging and wholesome , though not reassuring to the burden-bearing white Chapter * of
Xew York	LOCATION	's early history The trading-post established by the Dutch on the island of
Manhattan	LOCATION	, at the mouth of the
Hudson River	LOCATION	, in 1610-13 , presented to the student some interest - ing phases of colonial history in the seventeenth cen - tury , and before the settlement began to give any sign or promise of ever becoming one of the world 's great cities .

		Not until
1633	DATE	was it regarded as of sufficient importance to receive the name of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	.

		Twenty years later it acquired a form of municipal government from Governor Stuy vesant , who in
1664	DATE	surrendered the city to Governor Nicolls of
New England	LOCATION	; and its name was changed to
New York	LOCATION	.

		In
1673	DATE	the city was recaptured by the Dutch as an incident of the war between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	, and its name was again changed , this time to New Orange .

		It was restored to
England	LOCATION	by the Treaty of Westminster the fol - lowing year , and resumed its former name of
New York	LOCATION	.

		It received , in
1686	DATE	, the famous Dongan Charter , which was the basis of a plan of govern - ment for the great city which it has since become .

		Within a few years , and before the close of the seventeenth century , at the time of the accession of
William and Mary	PERSON	, it was the scene of an effort to establish popular government , led by
Jacob Leisler	PERSON	, which resulted in the execution of Leisler and one of his supporters on the charge of high treason .

		Such , in outline , are the materials for Mrs.
Schuyler Van Rensselaer	PERSON	's `` History of the City of
New York	LOCATION	in the Seventeenth Century '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a work in two volumes , aggregating nearly twelve hundred pages , and illustrated by two frontispiece maps .

		The volumes treat of `` New Amsterdam '' and ''
New York	LOCATION	under the Stuarts '' respectively .

		The author 's thoroughness is attested by the long lost of authorities consulted , at the end of each chapter ; some of them original documents or rare books to be found only in the
New York Society Library	ORGANIZATION	, to which library she pays a high tribute .

		The author has , however , presented no complete bibliography of the history of
New York	LOCATION	in these lists , having excluded some well - known books because of their inaccuracy of state - ment and their tendency to mislead the serious student .

		Under this rule , Irving 's '' Knickerbocker History '' is excluded , because , although written as a jest , it has been accepted as a history of a period with which no historian had yet familiarized the public ; and it has served to give an erroneous bias even to serious historians in later times .

		It is the effort to correct this that has apparently given to 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, Mrs. Van Rensselaer the zest with which she writes her account of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	and its people .

		And her account of the Dutch suffers not at all in inter - est by comparison with
Irving	PERSON	's because written in more serious style .

		Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	believes
Leisler	PERSON	, about whom students of history have quar - relled more than about any other colonial character , and upon whose career her second volume chiefly centres , to have been neither villain nor martyr , but a patriot born under a hapless star ; and she notes , as one of the effects of the Leislerian episode , the rise of parties which gradually found wider range of interest than merely local ones , and eventually became the Patriots and Tories of Revolutionary times .

		Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	's work is well done , and her volumes are valuable contributions to our historical literature .

		All who read them will look forward with interest to the two additional volumes which will carry the story of the city 's growth through the later Colonial and Revolutionary periods down to the year when
New York	LOCATION	was the capital of the nation and witnessed the inauguration of the first President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Somepopuiar Mr '
Garrett P. Serviss	PERSON	, who is known astronomy for as one of the most prolific of writers the curious .

		Q f p p U l ar books on astronomical themes , has until recently devoted himself chiefly to exploiting the wonders of the sky as revealed by small telescopes , striving to make his readers better acquainted with the constellations and the chief objects of interest in them .

		But his latest book , '' Curiosities of the Sky '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , has a widely different trend , being a popular discussion of various interesting matters on which astronomical research has recently thrown light .

		The book consists of four - teen separate essays of about twenty pages each .

		The first half-dozen of these are upon the distant realms which are tenanted by the fixed stars and nebulae .

		The mysteries of the Milky Way , the migra - tions of the stars -- which will eventually lead to the dismemberment of the constellations -- the flam - ing forth of new stars , and the new views of the nebulae which are brought out by the triumphs of modern photography , are all discussed in entertain - ing fashion .

		The remaining eight essays are devoted to topics connected with the solar system .

		Those on which modern developments in the science of physics have thrown especial light , such as the sun 's corona , the zodiacal light , and auroras , receive es - pecial attention .

		Mars , the moon , and the asteroids , are also treated in a fashion as unhackneyed as one can reasonably expect .

		The illustrations include thirty-six full-page plates , most of which are of unusual excellence . ''

		Man is man , A .

		volume that has passed through and master thirty editions in fifteen years , on so of Ms fate . ''

		apparently trite a subject as the Edu - cation of the `` Will , must certainly have found the secret of a popular appeal .

		This and more may be said of Dr.
Jules Payot	PERSON	's volume which has just ap - peared in English form -LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Though not so aptly suited to the needs of English readers , yet the common human nature to which the book appeals , and the admirably direct and fresh attack of the subject , will justify many an edition in En - glish .

		The book is fortunately free from the hack - neyed academic treatment of problems apart from their concrete setting , and equally from the undue simplification which solves all the loose knots but leaves the tight ones as badly tangled as ever .

		The text of the discourse remains the same : the inherent laziness of the human kind , the necessity of vitalizing ideas with true and clean motives , and the absolutely frank , almost confessional , attitude which self - examination requires .

		In setting forth the elemental place of action in the human life ,
M. Payot	ORGANIZATION	is not quite as brilliant as Professor James , but his task is differently conceived and no less practically exe - cuted .

		Such chapter headings as '' Day-dreams and Sensuality '' and '' Sophisms of the Indolent , '' and the influences of the '' Departed Great , '' suggest the trend of the book ; while the pertinent use of every - day examples and of helpful analogy further drives home the moral which even a tale unadorned might forcibly point .

		Those who are looking for such aids and inspiration as a plain book may give to plain people will find few writings more to their taste and need than this acceptable volume .

		Its appeal is not alone to teachers and those who have to do with training , but likewise to the larger mass who aspire to be in some measure masters of their fate .

Jefferson	PERSON	.

		This interesting and little-known book is now republished by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with an introduction and footnotes by Mr.
A. J. Morrison	PERSON	.

		A peculiar interest attaches to this work because its author was a self-educated man of letters , awake to the literary promise of our country and on the alert for literary material for his own use .

		He speaks of having with him on shipboard a library of nearly three hundred volumes , and adds : '' The Muses , whom I never ceased to woo , blessed me , I thought , not infrequently , with their nightly visita - tions ; and I soothed my mind to tranquillity with the fancied harmony of my verse . ''

		Landing at

		THE DIAL 23 though betraying no remarkable acumen or pro- fundity , are genuine and refreshing .

		Now and then , too , he favors his readers with a set of verses inspired by the new scenes .

		On the whole , it is a most agreeable book .

		To interpret the primitive and seem - The hard life ingly contradictory wants and aspira - tions of young people of industrial centres , to discover the soul of goodness in things evil , to summon the ambitions of generous youth to the service of universal justice , is the task which Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	has set herself in her latest book , '' The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		The spectacle of thwarted hope , of muti - lated affections , of perverted souls , lends these pages of Miss
Addams	PERSON	's a touch of sadness .

		There may be more enthusiasm for justice outside the circles of Halsted Street immigrants than she discovers ; but we can not blame her for reporting what she sees .

		We might ask rather more precise and concrete advice as to the actual methods we ought to use , those with which the daily struggles of the author make her so familiar ; but one must be adamant who does not , after reading this little book , search his own conscience , and , what is better , go forth in quest of adventures on behalf of the oppressed and the spiritually starved .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Useful Fiction catalogues , marking the initial step in carrying out the
A. L. A.	PERSON	plan of making cooperatively printed catalogues , as outlined before the
Minnetonka	LOCATION	meeting of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, have been published by the
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	.

		A list of about
2000	DATE	titles is printed , with both author and title entries , and frequent brief annotations , in a pamphlet of 147 pages , while shorter lists , of
1200	DATE	and 800 titles , are also issued .

		It is the publishers ' design '' to furnish to librarians and library patrons a near-at-hand substitute for the heavily alphabeted card catalog .

		From it small libraries may check their fiction titles , and have their catalogs , any number necessary , made up from slugs kept at head - quarters . ''

		Good authorities have been consulted in the compilation of these lists , and they are inexpensive as well as serviceable .

		The multiplication of books of selected readings , com - piled to provide material for the study of important subjects at their sources , is one of the most character - istic of educational publishing activities at the present time .

		History and literature having been fairly well covered by books of this sort , the movement is now being extended into the domains of social and political science , and now , by Dr.
Benjamin Rand	PERSON	, into those of ethics and philosophy .

		For Dr.
Rand	PERSON	's '' Modern Classical Philosophers , '' published not long ago , a companion volume of '' The Classical Moralists '' is now provided .

		It is a large volume of eight hundred pages , represent - ing all the great ethical thinkers of ancient and modern times , and amounts practically to a history of the sub - ject in the very words of those who have created it .

		Such works as this are of very great usefulness , and the present example is one of the best of its kind .

		An edition of TegneVs ''
Frithiof	PERSON	's Saga , '' edited by Professor
George T. Flom	PERSON	, is published by the
Engberg	PERSON	-
Hobnberg Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The work is pri - marily a gift-book , reproducing a Swedish edition adorned with many attractive illustrations .

		The editor has fitted it for use as a language-text by furnishing the customary apparatus of introduction , bibliography , and notes .

		He also reprints TegneVs '' Anmarkningar '' concerning the poem , as well as several of the author 's letters about it .

		The special feature of this edition is the introduction , which deals with TegneVs literary de - velopment , the sources and genesis of the poem , and the translations into other languages .

		This bibliography of the translations is very valuable , and it must have cost the editor much labor to collect the facts .

		Notes .

		We welcome another good source-book for the use of teachers of history .

		This time it is '' A Source History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' prepared by Professors
H. W. Caldwell	PERSON	and
C. E. Persinger	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Ainsworth & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a book for high schools , and the extracts given are boiled down to their essentials by omission of all but the most significant passages .

		The latest addition to the '' Musician 's Library '' of the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	is a volume of '' Songs from the Operas for Alto , '' edited by Mr.
H E. Krehbiel	PERSON	.

		Twenty - two composers are represented by twenty-nine songs .

		There are few really great songs in this collection , for the alto voice does not get the lyrical prizes , but
Gluck	PERSON	's '' Che Faro '' is alone good to bring up the average .

		The editor 's explanatory notes are helpful and interesting .

		Dr.
Samuel B. Harding	PERSON	's volume of '' Select Orations Illustrating American Political History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- offers a valuable aid to both teacher and student .

		The orations are for the most part abridged or represented by fragments , which makes it possible to give examples from thirty-four men , from Otis and
Henry	ORGANIZATION	to
Carl Schurz	PERSON	and Mr.
Booker	PERSON	T.
Washington	LOCATION	.

		An essay on '' Oratorical Style and Structure , '' by Professor
John M. Clapp	PERSON	, prefaces the selection . ''

		Fifty Songs by
Hugo Wolf	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Ernest Newman	PERSON	, form a new volume of the '' Musician 's Library , '' published by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are arranged for high voice , and accompanied by the editorial appara - tus customary with the books of this series .

		Most of the fifty are included within four groups , one Spanish , one Italian , and one each composed for texts by
Morike	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same publishers send us ■ Echoes of
Naples	LOCATION	, '' being thirty Neapolitan songs edited by
Signor Mario Favelli	PERSON	, and a volume of exercises in `` Hand Expan - sions and Contractions , '' by Mr.
E. R. Kroeger	PERSON	. ''

		The Great English Essayists , '' edited by Messrs.
W. J. and C. W. Dawson	PERSON	, is a new volume in '' The Reader 's Library , '' published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nearly half a hundred essays , or parts of essays , are given , grouped under the following six heads : '' The Classic Essay , '' '' The Letter Essay , '' '' The Short - Story Essay , '' '' The Biographical and Critical Essay , '' '' Impassioned Prose , '' and '' The Familiar Essay . ''

		Each group has an editorial essay by way of introduction .

		All of which makes a pleasing book of very good read - ing , so put together that its several parts serve to illu - minate one another as well as the general theme of the work as a whole .

		BRIEFER MENTION 58 NOTES 59 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 60 We were recently assured by the
New York	LOCATION	'' Nation '' that philologists are by no means the dull dogs that they are popularly supposed to be , and the assurance was fortified by modern in - stances in convincing exposition .

		The psycholo - gists also , under the leadership of Professor James and Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, are growing posi - tively genial ; and the sociologists , if we may in - clude among them such writers as Mr .


H. G. Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, are becoming fairly coruscating in their brilliancy .

		Even the dismal science now and then reckons among its adepts a scholar whose irrepressible vitality relieves it from the old-time reproach , and shows it to be really human in its implications .

		Just now it is the turn of history , -- if we may indulge in the method of generalization from a single ex - ample , and base our proposition upon the ad - dress of President
Hart	PERSON	before the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	at its meeting held during holiday week .

		The subject of Professor
Hart	PERSON	's address was '' Imagination in History , '' and it makes the liveliest sort of reading .

		The dry - asdusts may have worked their will upon other sessions of the meeting , but this one was given over to wisdom tempered with wit , and to his - torical scholarship garbed in the grace of literary expression .

		Mr.
Hart	PERSON	pays his respects to many kinds of imaginative historians -- the plain liars , the myth-makers , the hero - worshippers , the senti - mentalists , the writers of metaphyical leanings , the literary artists who are constitutionally incapable of accuracy , the historians who are determined to be picturesque and dramatic at all costs .

		Of deliberate historical fabrications he gives some of the familiar examples , and some very curious ones not nearly so well known .

		There was
George Psalmanazar	PERSON	, u whose very name is a guarantee of candid bad faith , '' and whose
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	'' was plainly one of the most distant spots visited by Sindbad the Sailor . ''

		There was
Sigonio	PERSON	, who forged a work of
Cicero	LOCATION	, and had his publisher obtain `` from the great scholar Sigonio an opinion that none but
Cicero	PERSON	could have written the book . ''

		There was
Lucas	PERSON	, an ingenious Frenchman , whose specialty was autograph letters , and who imposed upon a 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, single credulous customer with examples from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Lazarus	PERSON	to St.
Peter	PERSON	,
Judas Iscariot	LOCATION	to
Mary Magdalene	PERSON	, and
Strabo	PERSON	to Juvenal !

		Then in our own country there was the Keverend Mr.
Peters	PERSON	who invented Blue Laws , and the forger of the '' Cape Fear Mer - cury '' in the interests of the Mecklenburg myth , a document whose examination '' raised many embarrassing questions . ''

		The myth-makers have been busy in the field of American history , comparatively young as that history is .

		The story of
Marcus Whitman	PERSON	and how he saved
Oregon	LOCATION	has recently been `` resolved into its elementary gases '' by an ex - pert analyst .

		Other myths , such as those of the Pilgrim Fathers and the
Virginia Cavaliers	LOCATION	, are of such molluscous structure that it is difficult to strike them at a vital point , and they still persist in a sort of semi-animate existence .

		Dr.
Hart	PERSON	remarks truly , concerning one of them : '' My ancester ,
Stephen Hart	PERSON	, helped to settle Cam - bridge , and later was one of the fundamental orderers of the Fundamental Orders of
Connecticut	LOCATION	; but in the
Pequot War	LOCATION	he massacred Indian women and children mercilessly .

		I take no responsibility for his acts ; I refer the case to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs . ''

		The hero-myth , as exemplified by the portrait of
Washington	LOCATION	drawn by the inventive and sen - timental
Weems	PERSON	, is neatly characterized . ''

		Weems has never been properly understood by the American public ; he landed himself among the im - mortals by writing what is substantially a romance -- a kind of patriotic ' Sanford and
Merton	PERSON	' -- not intended to give information about
George Washington	PERSON	but to suggest virtuous conduct to young Americans .

		Who but an expert performer upon the imagination could personify
Washington	LOCATION	's father on the boy 's refusal to divide a fine large apple with his brothers and sisters ? '

		George looked in silence on the wide wilderness of fruit .

		He marked the busy humming bees , and heard the gay notes of birds ; then lifting his eyes filled with shining moisture to his father , he softly said , '' Well , Pa , only forgive me this time ; and see if I ever be so stingy any more . '' '

		Human nature rebels at this attempt to make a prig out of a youth who was probably more likely to steal apples than to divide them . ''

		Such examples of misdirected imagination in historical writing almost force one into the sci - entific camp , where facts alone are supposed to count .

		But husks are the provender there offered the hungry student , and he is not alto - gether to be blamed for hankering after the flesh-pots of invention .

		The president of the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	is under bonds to respect facts , and honor the men who give their lives to ascertaining them ; but he demands something more of the historian than the scra - ping together of facts , and realizes the justice of such criticism as he quotes from Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	: '' The historical expert starts with the
Magna Charta	ORGANIZATION	and makes a preliminary survey .

		Then he begins his march down the centuries , intrenching every position lest he be caught unawares by the critics .

		His intel - lectual forces lack mobility , as they must wait for their baggage trains ... There are references to bulky vol - umes , where at the foot of every page the notes run along , like little angry dogs barking at the text . ''

		So our writer has a good word even for
Froude	PERSON	, and a more than good word for
Macaulay	DATE	, for neither the unreliability of the one nor the pre - judice of the other can altogether nullify the splendid picturesqueness and dramatic qualities of both .

		Those men , and
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	and
Gibbon	PERSON	and
Parkman	PERSON	, are all quoted from to illustrate imagination of the kind that must excite the ad - miration of the most captious historian ; and by way of contrast , a single sentence , running to over three hundred words , from
Bishop Stubbs	PERSON	, is cited as an example of historical writing that '' would not arouse a poet to an ode nor a nation to revolution . ''

		This is perhaps as far as the speaker dared to go when addressing an audience '' composed wholly of cautious persons who never open their mouths without a foot-note to a trusty original . ''

		On the whole , Professor
Hart	PERSON	's plea is for imagination , properly regulated of course , in the writing of history . ''

		There is much in his - tory that can not be measured like atomic weights , or averaged like insurance losses , '' is his epigrammatic way of saying it .

		All histori - cal writing that is worth anything recognizes `` this impotence of facts taken by themselves , this infusion of a shadowy something which may be called sentiment , or the ideal , or spirit , or imagination . ''

		History is `` an art which stands alongside that of the painter , the sculptor , and the architect , which puts the great historian parallel with the philosopher , the seer , and the poet . ''

		And the final summary of the argument is thus finely expressed : '' The danger of the historian is in imagination , that is , in the kind of imagination which invents details or seizes upon the unimportant ones , or combines them into pictures which are but the outside ; which tell us nothing of the stir and movement of human souls , the clash of human wills , of the thinking of national thoughts .

		There is another kind of imagination which works from within outword ; which makes the reader see , as the historian sees , the real characters of men ; which divines their motives ; which , allowing for human weaknesses and for the pressure of adverse circum - stances , informs us whether this or that man , this or that peoplo , this or that age , this or that standard has carried forward civilization , opened wide the gates for thought , liberated souls .

		There is no great history without large imagination , any more than there is painti ing , or for that matter , scientific discovery . ''

		THE DIAL 37 CASUAL COMMENT .

		Gladstone the man of letters received but a small part of the tribute that was paid to the great statesman on the occasion of his centenary -LRB- Decem - ber 29 -RRB- .

		The omission may justify a passing word in recognition of Gladstone the writer and lover of literature .

		His very first book , `` The State in its Relations with the Church , '' which appeared in
1838	DATE	as a plea for the union of church and state , had the distinction of a review from
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's pen . ''

		The book , '' said
Macaulay	PERSON	, `` though not a good book , shows more talent than many good books .

		It contains some eloquent and ingenious passages .

		It bears the signs of much patient thought . ''

		Talent rather than genius was , indeed , a characteristic of all
Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		-- a wonderful facility in the handling of material and in the use of words .

		It was the same quality that appeared , intensified by the arts of the orator , in his speeches .

		A Quarterly Reviewer , commenting on
Gladstone	PERSON	's four-hour speech on the budget of
1860	DATE	, used the phrase , `` The enchanted region of pure Gladstonism , -- that terrible com - bination of relentless logic and dauntless imagina - tion . ''

		One can not read
Gladstone	PERSON	's printed words without feeling the vigor and earnestness of his thought .

		His ''
Juventus Mundi	ORGANIZATION	, '' written in the intervals between engrossing public duties , is a re - remarkable piece of scholarly research touched with enthusiasm -- whatever its defects as a contribution to the right understanding of Homer .

		Its opinions are stated with emphasis and clearness .

		Homer 's treatment of the gods and goddesses of
Greece	LOCATION	is , as a representation of '' the Olympian religion , '' '' one of the topmost achievements of the human mind . ''

		His appreciation of animal grace is described in glowing terms : '' Homer had a profound perception of the beauty of animals , at least in the case of the horse , as to color , form , and especially movement . ''

		It was
Gladstone	PERSON	's tremendous earnestness , the con - centration of all his energies on the matter in hand , that enabled him to accomplish so much , both in literature and in affairs of state .

		The multiplication of learned societies , as called to one 's attention by their holiday conventions in
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and elsewhere , offers encour - aging proof that our national energies are not all directed toward materialistic ends .

		The large and enthusiastic gathering of scholars in the halls of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, and in other public buildings of the city , was made up of members of no fewer than nine learned societies , -- the American His - torical Association , the American Economic Asso - ciation , the
American Political Science Association	ORGANIZATION	, the
American Statistical Association	ORGANIZATION	, the
American Sociological Society	ORGANIZATION	, the
American Association for Labor Legislation	ORGANIZATION	, the
American Social Science Association	ORGANIZATION	, the
Bibliographical Society of America	ORGANIZATION	, and the
American Society of Church History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Simultaneously with the
New York	LOCATION	meetings there was a mustering in
Boston	LOCATION	of the American Asso - ciation for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	, and its nu - merous subsidiary and allied societies , under the presidency of Dr.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	.

		In the halls of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Harvard Medical School	ORGANIZATION	and elsewhere in
Boston	LOCATION	and in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, were held meetings of physiolo - gists , anatomists , bacteriologists , chemists , mathe - maticians , entomologists , astronomers , seed-analysts , geologists , and representatives of many other - ologies , -- all presumably interested in making Science really and beneficially the concern , not of the school or the study or the laboratory merely , but of society at large .

		Whatever the comparative cultural value of science and humanism -LRB- those jealous educational rivals of long standing -RRB- , that late ` lamented French humanist ,
Ferdinand Brunetiere	PERSON	, went entirely too far in asserting that science is bankrupt and has no new things in store for mankind .

		Notable gatherings of American scholars occurred at
Baltimore	LOCATION	in the Christmas vacation week , when the
Archaeological Institute of America	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Philological Association	ORGANIZATION	met in annual convention under the hospitable roof of the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Despite the polysyllabic names and learned character of these bodies , one presidential address at least was in lighter vein and provocative of much mirth .

		Professor
Gildersleeve	PERSON	, president of the
Philological Association	ORGANIZATION	, succeeded in so presenting the '' Aspects of Philological Work in
America	LOCATION	'' as to enliven and entertain his large audience .

		His fifty years ' study of languages , and his almost fifty years ' connection with the society he was addressing , qualified him to speak in a richly reminiscent and instructive strain .

		Yet he earnestly deprecated being called the Nestor of the
Associa	LOCATION	- tion . ''

		The grievance of grievances , '' he continued , ' • is that .

		Nestor has left a name to be fastened on every man who has had the opportunity of making himself foolish in the sight of the third generation . ''

		The titles of a few of the papers read will show the nature of the discussions for which so many eminent scholars had assembled from all points of the com - pass .

		There was an essay on '' The Origin of the Idea of the Atom According to Heracleides and Asclepiades , '' one on '' Certain Linguistic Tests of the Relative Antiquity of the Iliad and the Odyssey , '' another on '' The Treatment of Time in the jEneid , '' and still another on '' Certain Popular Elements in the Satires of Persius . ''

		A worthy successor to Pro- fessor
Gildersleeve as President of the Association	ORGANIZATION	was chosen in Dr.
Paul Shorey	PERSON	of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rooster as > a hero of the stage is the novel feature of
M. Rostand	PERSON	's new play , `` Chanti - cleer '' -LRB- as we will call it in English -RRB- , about which there has been a vast amount of talk and conjecture and curious inquiry , ever since it was reported ,
eight years ago	DATE	, that the author of '' Cyrano '' and '' L'Aiglon '' had conceived a novel and startling 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, idea for dramatic treatment .

		Why
Paris	LOCATION	has had to wait all this weary while to hear the marvellous '' cock '' crow appears to have been due to illness , to a death in the poet 's family , and , later , to the lamented demise of the actor Coquelin .

		In regard to the genesis of the new play , its author is reported to have expressed himself at some length in a recent interesting interview .

		That he had taken a hint from Aristophanes or any other writer , he would not admit . ''

		It may be possible , '' he acknowledged , '' that others have had the same idea as mine .

		They tell me that in the Middle Ages certain parts of ' Le Roman du
Renard	PERSON	' were arranged for the stage and acted ; but I have not verified the statement , and no one can show me the text . ''

		Pressed with questions as to whence came his first suggestion for the play , the poet replied : '' Where did the idea come from ?

		By chance , while idling in the coun - try .

		Soon after I had produced ' L'Aiglon ' I was ill , and to convalesce I established myself at
Cambo	LOCATION	.

		Near the house I then occupied there was a farm .

		One day , while walking about , I entered the farm - yard .

		I can still see this farmyard , full of light and thronged with happy animals .

		There were all sorts of them ... There was a magpie .

		There was a cage on the wall full of birds .

		All these creatures seemed to be thinking and talking together of a thousand things .

		Suddenly the cock came in , and there was a general commotion .

		It seemed as if his entrance had been made the topic of a new conversation ; they really talked about this rooster .

		... Then these animals , I know not why , seemed to me the characters in a sentimental , ideal play , of which the background was this barnyard .

		I saw the play before beginning it , and I called it ' A Little Corner of the World . '

		For a long time it lived in my mind under this title .

		Then a novel , a very good novel , was published with the same title .

		Thereupon I named my play after the principal character , • Chanticleer , ' so called in ' Le Roman du
Renard	PERSON	' to distinguish the cock .

		At the same time that I found the title I found the actor for the part , Coquelin . ''

		A NOTEWORTHY EXHIBITION OF MANUSCRIPTS and rare books , loaned by different persons , was held at the
Columbia University Library	ORGANIZATION	in connec - tion with the recent annual convention of various learned societies , including the Bibliographical So - ciety of
America	LOCATION	.

		Especially interesting to members of the
American Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	were various autograph manuscripts of famous historians , mediae - val chronicles in manuscript , and early editions of ancient historians .

		There was also on exhibition the famous
Columbus	LOCATION	letter announcing the discovery of
America	LOCATION	in
1492	DATE	, the first dated edition of Americus Vespucius -LRB- 1504 -RRB- , Corlear 's Journal of
1634	DATE	des - cribing the Mohawk Indians , the manuscript rolls of the
Concord Minute Men	ORGANIZATION	, and other documents of the colonial and revolutionary periods .

		English his - tory was well represented by the manuscripts of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's and
Hume	PERSON	's Histories , and
Gibbon	PERSON	's notes to his great work , by the original proclamation of the Commonwealth -LRB- dated
May 19 , 1649	DATE	-RRB- , and by printed books of rarity and interest .

		From Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	's splendid collection came , among other treasures , the famous `` Golden Gospels '' once owned by
King Henry VIIL	ORGANIZATION	, written in gold on purple vellum , and for a time in the keeping of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was presented by
Leo X.	PERSON	to
Henry	ORGANIZATION	when the latter received the title '' Fidei Defensor . ''

		It is supposed to be about twelve hundred years old .

		This remarkable exhibition , after attracting the his - torians and bibliophiles and other savants assembled in convention , continued open for two weeks for the benefit of the general public .

		The hand of little employment hath the daintier sense , said Hamlet on a certain occasion ; but he might have added that through too little employment the hand doth lose what sense it had .

		In a recent address before the
Liverpool Philomathic Society	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Frederick Treves	PERSON	, the eminent surgeon to the
King	PERSON	, lamented the decline of manual dexterity and nice skill , with the increasing use of machinery in the arts and manufactures .

		The loom , the sewing machine , and the typewriter , he declared , have re - duced to a soulless level of uniformity what formerly were the diversely excellent products of a million hands ; the stamping machine displaces the wood - carver and the decorator ; and the human hand is in some danger of forgetting its cunning .

		I wish I could -- But I can not run a Typewriter more than a Sewing - Machine .

		Will the next generation learn to write -- any more than learn the alphabet ? ''

		Personal letters from both these men now lie before us and give point to the above passage , although Dr.

		Another letter of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's , dictated and typewritten , also lies before us , and perhaps helps to explain the com - parative illegibility of the one executed by the little - used pen .

		After all , if the time has passed -LRB- or soon will have passed -RRB- when the Japanese worker in ivory could spend half a lifetime in carving a series of con - centric hollow spheres , his energies are set free for what may well prove to be higher and worthier activities .

		Some curious phases of biblioklepsis -LRB- the Greek word sounds less harsh than `` book-stealing '' -RRB- attract now and then the notice of those interested in such things .

		The dexterity with which an invet - erate book-thief will gain his end would , if turned into legitimate channels , win him fame and fortune in a short time .

		THE DIAL 39 room of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	presented a clear case of perverted genius .

		There has been recently recalled , by a chronicler of the vandalism com - mitted in that library , the instance of a professional biblioklept who managed to make off with a copy of the rare first edition of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's u Fanshawe , '' and , after removing the book-plate , to sell it to some obscure and conscienceless or uninformed dealer , from whose hands it finally reached a
New York	LOCATION	auction house , and was returned thence to the lib - rary .

		Such treasures are too rare and too easily identified to be of much commercial value to thieves .

		A curious sequel to this incident was the search that it led to , on the part of those who read or heard about it .

		for stray copies of the valuable little book that might be lurking in ancestral attics or cupboards ; and , as a result of all this rummaging , several copies were actually unearthed and put on the market , so that the price speedily fell from eight hundred to
four hundred dollars	MONEY	.

		Often enough it has been noted that the bibliokleptic desire seizes upon persons otherwise honest and respectable ; a survival , pos - sibly , of primitive predatory instincts .

		The book of the year in
London	LOCATION	can not be named with ease and certainty by any reviewer of the extensive literary output of the last twelve months in
England	LOCATION	.

		But probably more general attention has been drawn to Sir
Ernest Shackleton	PERSON	's work ,
4i	ORGANIZATION	The Heart of the Antarctic , '' than to any other book of acknowledged worth and importance .

		Its extra-literary or practical interest of course greatly overshadows its purely literary merit , al - though it is written in a style admirable for its strength and effectiveness , and deserves to live as a narrative of vivid and fascinating quality .

		Curiously enough , the book of the coming year in the English - speaking world , if not in the world at large , prom - ises to be another autobiographical account of polar exploration , -- namely , Captain
Peary	PERSON	's story of his dash to the
North Pole	LOCATION	and his safe return , which will next month begin its serial appearance .

		The public appetite has been whetted by a most extra - ordinary series of events for this true account of a genuine exploration , and it will be cause for surprise rf the book does not attain an enormous circulation .

		The censorship of books for Sunday-school LrBRARiEs , as carried on by a volunteer body known as the
Church Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, organized at
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		thirty years ago , appears to be most thorough .

		We read in regard to the monthly routine duties of this body , that its forty members , earnest men and women of the
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, are divided into a certain number of reading com - mittees , and that every book examined by its appro - priate committee is reported upon in writing by each member of that committee .

		If a majority of these written opinions are favorable , the book is brought before the monthly meeting of the association , the opinions are read aloud , discussion follows , and a vote is taken on the eligibility of the book .

		A nega - tive vote from a fourth of those present casts the book into extra-ecclesiastical darkness .

		All this work is of course primarily for the benefit of
Sunday	DATE	- school and parish libraries of the church which the association represents ; but the published catalogues -LRB- of which four have now appeared -RRB- are obtainable by anyone on request from the Secretary of the

		No books are sold and no orders are taken by the society for books , but all its expenses are said to be met by voluntary contributions of
twenty-five cents	MONEY	each from those receiving the catalogues .

		If such a thing as sterilized literature is possible , the books sanc - tioned by this reading committee may surely be recommended with a tolerable sense of security .

		SCHOOL BOARD AND SUPERINTENDENT .

		fTo the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The problem of school administration is filled with many practical difficulties , and has never been quite comprehensively solved .

		True , it is always easy enough to say what ought to be ; but it is not quite so easy to determine just how to secure the exact thing desired .

		There exists , for instance , among some school boards , the view that the superintendent , as the expert head of the school system , should have pretty full swing in the conduct of the purely pedagogical side of school work .

		These school boards hold that the superintendent should have both the initiative and the final word in these matters ; that any attempt at official interference is un - warranted , and likely to be disastrous to the best inter - ests of the school .

		Another view existing in some quarters is that the school board is , and of necessity must be , the final authority upon all matters , both of a professional and a business nature ; that the initiative may and should be accorded to the superintendent in strictly professional matters , but beyond this is dangerous ground ; that no well-equipped school board will permit the superin - tendent to extend his official acts beyond the field of the initiative .

		The superintendents themselves are not wholly agreed as to the exact scope and extent of their duties and authority .

		But the consensus of opinion seems to be in favor of their complete and absolute control of purely professional work , the school board exercising only a perfunctory relation to such matters .

		The writer has been a somewhat interested student of the problem for a score or more of years , during which , both as a teacher and a member of several school boards , as well as a parent and patron of the schools , he has tried to consider the subject from every point of view .

		And he is frank to say that from the view-point of the public interest -- which , as he views it , is always of paramount consideration , his conviction is firm that the school board should have the final word upon every important educational question and matter of policy .

		It seems right and necessary that this should be so .

		The superintendent is at most but the servant of the board .

		He is not its superior ; he is employed to do its will .

		It is true that he is , or ought to be , an intelli - gent , conscientious , and wise servant ; and he can , and does , do much to further the interests which he is em - ployed to conserve .

		His advice and services upon pro- fessional subjects are admittedly invaluable .

		But while all this is true , it is the school board that is and must be responsible to the people .

		The school board is the trustee of the educational interests , -- not the superin - tendent , and not any other employee of the board .

		There is always danger in giving great and exclusive authority to an individual .

		The superintendents of schools are not less human and not a whit wiser than their fellows in other walks of life and other fields of endeavor .

		As a school board is answerable to the people that put it in power , so should a superintendent be subject to the power that gave him his position and authority .

		There is safety in numbers ; and a school board , if wisely and judiciously selected , may be trusted with the final word .

		To say that such selections are not always made wisely and judiciously does not mili - tate against the main contention .

		A school board of three , or five , or seven , or more members , will care - fully weigh important school questions before pronounc - ing the final verdict .

		The danger from favoritism , from chicane , from trick or fraud , is never inconsiderable .

		School systems have been known to suffer severely on these accounts .

		Here is where the right to review the actions and to keep a check on the recommendations of superintendents be - comes vitally important .

		This is a field which offers opportunity for independent investigation .

		It is a field which , if properly worked , means much to the defence - less teacher in every school system .

		The writer has known of superintendents who wel - comed the right of review , of independent investigation and inquiry ; but their number is not large .

		Most of them smart under any attempt at the exercise of authority over their professional acts .

		They assert that it is an unwarranted exercise of authority , an exercise of the right of review and of criticism which belittles them in the public eye and does harm to the system .

		The writer has never become convinced of the correct - ness of this professional point of view .

		On the contrary , he believes that the best interests of the schools demand that the right to the final word be always reserved to the board itself , which , after all , is only the voice of the people whom the board represents and serves .

		To say that the voice of the people is not always wisely ex - pressed is to say , in another way , that all human effort is imperfect .

		`` I SWAN ! ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		My eye has just caught the following passage in
Thk Dial	ORGANIZATION	of
October 16	DATE	, p. 273 : `` A writer in the
London	LOCATION
` Nation	ORGANIZATION	' comments on our sup - posed use of ' I swan . ' '

		I frequently ask my American friends , ' says this writer , ' if they can give me the derivation of '' I swan , '' and never yet have I heard even an attempt to do so .

		Fifty years ago '' I swan '' was in regular use by poets and novelists , and to-day it is employed in current American speech , though a certain class of Americans seem to find it necessary to apologize for the use of what they think is slang . '

		Then we are confidently assured that it is not slang , but merely a corruption of ' I warrant you , ' through ' I ` se warrant , ' ' A 's warn , ' of the Liddesdale farmer .

		Thus what has been considered a bit of Yankee slang turns out to be an idiom of the Scottish border that ' fifty years ago ... was in regular use by poets and novelists . '

		Henceforth , our polite circles of
Boston	LOCATION	, or
Chicago	LOCATION	, or
Kalamazoo	LOCATION	, or any other centre of refinement and culture , may feel at liberty to con - tinue the daily use of ' I swan , ' but with no longer any need of the hitherto customary apology .

		What a relief ! ''

		We all know that many words and phrases , popularly supposed to be Americanisms , were brought over by the early settlers from
England	LOCATION	, where they have become obsolete .

		So often has an alleged Americanism been proved to be a survival of an English provincialism , that there are times when we Americans may well ask ourselves , '' Is our reputed faculty for coining words after all a delusion ? ''

		Our British cousins are too apt to insist that it is .

		The easy way in which your re - viewer accepted the gold brick handed out by the writer in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' confirms this .

		It may be necessary to haul down the Stars and Stripes , but let us not do so without at least striking a blow .

		Permit me to offer the following comments on the above passage .

		-LRB- 1 -RRB- The writer in the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' has never
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 '' heard even an attempt '' to explain '' I swan . ''

		An attempt , doubtless a successful one , was made twenty years ago in the
Century Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, where we read : '' A euphemistic variation of swear • cf. svcow , a similar evasion . ''

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The notion that '' I warrant you '' is '' an idiom of the Scottish border '' which originated a beggarly half-century ago is diverting , seeing that it has been in vogue among English poets and authors for at least three centuries .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- The writer 's further notion that '' I warrant yon '' and '' I swan '' are identical in meaning is also amusing , for '' I swan '' is an expletive .

		Moreover , though no fewer than twenty-eight forms of '' I warrant you '' are recorded in the English Dialect Dictionary , '' I swan '' is not one of them .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- `` I swan '' is declared by lexicographers , even English ones , to be an Americanism .

		This of course is not conclusive , for even lexicographers are not infallible ; but as the examples they quote are all American and run back to
1842	DATE	, clearly the burden of proof lies on him who asserts that it is not an Americanism .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- In their '' Slang and its Analogues , '' Farmer and
Henley	PERSON	quote an example from Mrs.
Kirkland	PERSON	's '' Forest Life , '' published in
1842	DATE	-- or before the idiom is said to have originated along the Scottish border .

		But that is a much-belated example , for in a letter written from
Boston	LOCATION	and printed in the '' New fork Packet '' of
November 22 , 1784	DATE	, we read : ' ' When I left this town
last April	DATE	, I was -LRB- you will remem - ber -RRB- very desirous that we should obtain a charter of incor - poration ... Go , go to
New York	LOCATION	, gentlemen , go and see what pickle that town is in , and then tell me -LRB- if you dare -RRB- of getting Mayors .

		Aldermen , and the Lord knows what besides !

		Cui bono , my friends ?

		Nay , I swan -LRB- as the old saying is -RRB- , we of
Boston	LOCATION	, after all .

		are the better off than those of
New York	LOCATION	; have we not got a fine public walk , now well planted , gravelled and fenced in ?

		Whereas , at
New York	LOCATION	-LRB- although they have what they call their fields -RRB- , yet none of them have ever thought as yet of planting a single tree for public ornament or utility .


Ergo	ORGANIZATION	, no charter for
Boston	LOCATION	; and I will vote against every attempt to bring in this new mode of govern - ment . '

		* Note the words '' as the old saying is , '' showing that one hundred and twenty-six years ago the idiom was well established .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- Finally , the expression carries on its face proof that it is an Americanism .

		Your Britisher comes out with a good honest '' damn , '' but your American , ever fond of soft swearing , dilutes it to '' darn . ''

		Hence , '' I swan '' is eminently characteristic .

		SECTIONALISM IN LEARNED SOCIETIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		It ought not to be necessary to point out to the writer of the communication on `` A Localized American Academy , '' in your last issue , that such institutions as the American Academy of Arts and Letters can not be established on a geographical basis .

		It is not a question of where a man lives , but what he has done .

		Naturally , it is the tendency of men eminent in art or literature to gravitate to the great cities of the country , and par - ticularly to the older centres of culture .

		Artists , in - deed , as in the cases of
Sargent	LOCATION	and
Abbey	LOCATION	, are quite as likely to make their homes abroad .

		But they are none the less American by birth and inheritance .

		The
Academie Franeaise	ORGANIZATION	is made up almost wholly of men who live in
Paris	LOCATION	, yet no one would think of denying its claim to represent fairly the literary ideals and per - formance of the French nation .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I have been reading your paper with much interest , as I always do , and I notice in a recent issue a review of '' The Literary History of the
Adelphi	LOCATION	and its
Neigh	LOCATION	- bourhood , '' by Mr.
Brereton	PERSON	.

		May I observe that I am the publisher of this work , and my friends
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue it for me in
America	LOCATION	; of course the book is of
London	LOCATION	origin .

		Like my friend the author , I am also a resident in the
Adelphi	LOCATION	.

		You ask what part of the neighbourhood de - scribed in this book is known as the
Adelphi	LOCATION	.

		I think it is that part which forms a square with its front to the Thames known as
Adelphi Terrace	ORGANIZATION	, its west side
Robert Street	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- named after
Robert Adam	PERSON	-RRB- , its east side Adam Street , and its north side John Street -LRB- after
John Adam	PERSON	-RRB- , in which will be found the well-known
Adams House	ORGANIZATION	occupied by the Society of Arts .

		This square block was practically all built by the
Brothers Adam	ORGANIZATION	, architects ; and , as you will note , is named after the family .

		Your notice fairly describes the book and its literary associations .

		I am glad to say they continue to this day , as we have as neighbors on this Terrace some good American citizens , such as Mr. and Mrs.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	; there are also
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	the dramatist ,
Sidney	PERSON	Low the historical writer and journalist ,
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, novelist and dramatist ,
J. B. Atley	PERSON	, another well - known man of letters ; and of course my publishing business is housed at
No. 1 Adelphi Terrace	ORGANIZATION	and No. 19 Adam Street -- houses which show the characteristics of the art of the brothers for whom the street was named .

		I may add that should any of your friends desire to visit this interesting neighbourhood , they will find the '' quartier , '' as Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	calls it , by taking the first turn westward after leaving the Hotel
Cecil	PERSON	or the Savoy , and it certainly will give me great pleasure to show them anything of interest there is to be seen in the

		A
Southern Woman	ORGANIZATION	's Reminiscences .

		* If Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	's volume of '' Reminiscences of a Long Life '' does not sell with the best novels of the season , the reason will lie elsewhere than in its power to seize and hold the interest of any intelligent reader .

		American autobiography and reminiscence has attained many a high level during the past decade , but here is a book which the reader will unhesitatingly put on his choicest shelf with the best of it all .

		A happy girlhood and a happy marriage in the best circles of the old
Virginia	LOCATION	life of the middle of the last cen - tury , the fiery test of extreme poverty and humil - iation in the wreck of that society incident to the Civil War , the removal to
New York City	LOCATION	and the grim struggle there to pick up the broken threads of life and weave them once more into a comely fabric , with the slow but ever advancing march to a position of usefulness and influence and honor beyond anything which either she or her gifted husband had dared hope for , -- this is the framework of Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	's story .

		At the outbreak of the war Mr.
Pryor	PERSON	was a member of the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the fateful news of the secession of
South Caro	LOCATION	- lina reached
Washington	LOCATION	, the Pryors , President
Buchanan	PERSON	, and others in high social and official station , were attending a wedding .

		Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	herself bent over the back of the President 's chair and gave him the momentous information , just received over the wires by Representative
Keitt	PERSON	of the seceding state .

		Falling back in a dazed condition , the President grasped both arms of his chair , and begged her , in a whisper , to have his carriage summoned .

		She and her husband immediately called their own carriage , and drove away , '' with no more thought of bride , bridegroom , wedding-cake or wedding breakfast . '' ''

		This , '' she continues , '' was the tremendous event which was to change all our lives , -- to give us poverty for riches , mutila - tion and wounds for strength and health , obscur - ity and degradation for honor and distinction , exile and loneliness for inherited home and friends , pain and death for happiness and life .

Pryor	PERSON	's husband threw him - self energetically into the cause of his section and attained distinction as a brave and effec - tive commander in the Confederate army , he * My Day .

		At one time or another he had met in battle
Generals Hancock	PERSON	,
Slocum	LOCATION	,
Butterfield	LOCATION	,
Sickles	LOCATION	,
Fitz-John Porter	PERSON	,
McClellan	PERSON	, and
Grant	PERSON	, all of whom became his firm friends in later years . ''

		They had fought loyally under opposing banners , and from time to time , as the war went on , one and another had been defeated ; but over all and through all , their allegiance had been given to a banner that has never surrendered -- the standard of the universal brotherhood of all true men . ''

		In
November , 1864	DATE	, while she was leading a painfully economical life at
Petersburg	LOCATION	, virtually in a state of siege , with a babe less than a year old in her arms , came the news that General
Pryor	PERSON	had been captured and was held as a prisoner of war .

		It was at first ordered that he be taken to
Fort Warren	LOCATION	, in
Boston Harbor	LOCATION	; but he was finally committed to
Fort Lafayette	LOCATION	instead , where his privilege of a daily walk upon the ramparts allowed him to look upon the mist - blurred outlines of the great city where in later years he was destined to an honored position upon the Supreme Bench , and his no less worthy wife to a place of effective leadership , especially in the benevolent and charitable activities of the best social life of the metropolis .

		But in the meanwhile , what grief , toil , and humiliation !

		In the little cottage at Petersburg an old trunk full of the finery of a happier day is dragged forth .

		The laces are remorselessly ripped from evening gowns , made deftly into the forms then in vogue , and sent to
Richmond	LOCATION	to be sold .

		Silks and muslins and artificial flowers followed the laces when it was found that
Richmond	LOCATION	could furnish a market for the tasteful creations which her ingenuity could devise under the keen spur of want of food for herself and children .

		But there was humor to season even that dish of woe . ''

		Aunt
Jinny	PERSON	, '' an old negro woman , was vexed in conscience because Mrs.
Pryor	PERSON	was '' sho ` ly leadin ' de po ' young lambs in
Richmond	LOCATION	into vanity '' by the powerful halter of such finery , when the Almighty has told us that we should clothe ourselves rather with the garment of righteousness .

		But
Eliza	PERSON	, another negro friend in need , cut her short right at that point : '' You ` pear to me to be mighty intimate with God A'mighty .

		Now you just run ` long home an ' leave my mistis to ` er work .

		How would you look with nothin ' on but a garment of righteousness ? ''

		She turned to her table and wrote , '' Is the Commanding General aware of the nature of the ration issued this day to the destitute women of Petersburg ? ''

		The delivery of this note brought in haste an orderly with an official slip commanding the Quartermaster and Commissary to '' furnish Mrs.
Roger A. Pryor	PERSON	with all she may demand or require , charging the same to the private account of

		Mrs.
Roger A. Pryor	PERSON	, '' the response went back to him , '' is not insensible to the generous offer of Major-General Hartsuff , but he ought to have known that the ration allowed the destitute women of
Petersburg	LOCATION	must be enough for Mrs.

		Even the tearful ap - peal of Mrs.

Great Britain	LOCATION	down to the date of the death of Cary the translator .

		Translations are also noticed and liberally ci'ed .

		Biographical notices , based upon the '' Dictionary of National Biography , '' of all the known authors , are pro- vided .

		The author exhibits again the vigilance , industry , and scholarship which he has taught us to expect from him .

		The arrangement of all this material is `` in the chronological order of the first work quoted , '' the several citations from one author being grouped together .

		It is ill looking a gift - horse in the mouth , but the re - viewer is constrained to say that this plan results in some confusion of different eras .

		For ex - ample ,
Merivale	LOCATION	, commenting in
1843	DATE	upon
Francis Horner	PERSON	's studies in
Dante	LOCATION	, undertaken to beguile his dying days in
1817	DATE	, is made to precede
Horner	PERSON	himself by some forty pages , all but three lines of those forty pages being de - voted to citations of dates between
1814	DATE	and
1822	DATE	.

		Again , an anecdote is taken from
Thomas Moore	PERSON	's Diary illustrating the prefer - ence entertained by
Moore	PERSON	for
Wright	PERSON	's trans - lation as compared with
Cary	PERSON	's .

		But before coming to
Wright	PERSON	himself we have to traverse no less than 540 pages , a long gap which Dr.
Toynbee	PERSON	has neglected to bridge by cross - references .

		This quite mechanical arrangement has the merit of bringing all the comment of each author together , all the material being rendered accessible by means of the Index , the numerous notes and cross-references , and the Chronological List of Authors -- which , how - ever , is not chronological , but is arranged in the order described above .

		Dr.
Toynbee	PERSON	has en - riched the work with an Introduction in which he gives a brief outline of the course of Dante criticism in
England	LOCATION	.

		Here , and in the Index , under the heads `` Commedia '' and `` Dante , '' are grouped together some of the more terse and distinctive pronouncements , pro and con , many of which are illustrations of the English genius for denouncing what it can not under - stand .

		A noticeable feature of the work is the hom - age done to the Rev.
H. F. Cary	PERSON	, by making his death the terminus ad quern , an homage jus - tified rather by the reputation of
Cary	ORGANIZATION	than by his real merit as a translator .

		Indeed ,
Cary	PERSON	bulks bigger in these pages than anyone else except
Dante	PERSON	, whose '' English Duplicate and Re - incarnation ''
Coleridge	PERSON	declared him to be .

		No work in the English language , except
Macpherson	PERSON	's Ossian , has been more persistently over-rated .

		To parody
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's unlucky 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, prophecy about
Dante	PERSON	, it does seem that
Cary	PERSON	's reputation has gone on increasing because he has been so little read .

		To the
Cary	ORGANIZATION	legend , Dr.
Toynbee	PERSON	has contributed an impetus , not only here but in an annotated edition of
Cary	ORGANIZATION	's translation .

		Scholarship , however , not poetic taste , is the forte of our author .

		Why
Cole	PERSON	- ridge should have so praised
Cary	PERSON	in the first place , is an interesting question .

		Certainly ,
Coleridge	PERSON	was a good judge of poetry ; that he was not an infallible judge is shown by his extreme admiration for the sonnets of
Bowles	ORGANIZATION	.

		An impulsive critic , he was doubtless overawed by
Cary	PERSON	's superior knowledge of
Dante	LOCATION	, whose work had hitherto been imperfectly known in
England	LOCATION	, and scantily appreciated .

		Cary offered the first presentable translation ;
Coleridge	PERSON	, who was getting up Dante about that time , found the translation and notes serviceable ; he paid his debt to
Cary	PERSON	in the most effectual way by praising the latter in the famous lecture of
1818	DATE	; having set up as an authority on the subject , he could not conveniently withdraw anything he might have said , especially after all the world had taken up the laud from him as critical cory - pheus .

		All this , I admit , is little better than reading between the lines ; but it may have as much foundation as some of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's own critical divinations .

		At all events , one has only to analyze the first passage which
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	quotes from
Cary	PERSON	in the notes of his lecture , to perceive how uncritical was the praise he lavished to the misleading of the nation .

		The fact is that
Cary	PERSON	's traducement of the divine Tuscan could have found acceptance only among a people essentially ignorant of the poet , and at a time when interest was just beginning to awaken .

		To be sure , he is a competent writer of blank verse , but in a movement which does not sug - gest the movement of any great poet except sometimes
Milton	PERSON	.

		Does Dante soar easily and swiftly , like an eagle ?

		Cary flutters like a bird whose plumage is entangled in the lime-twigs .

		Does
Dante	PERSON	say a thing and have done ?

		Cary says it twice .

		Is Dante simple and severe ?

		Cary is turgid and ornate .

		Does Dante stamp the precious metal with his own image and super - scription ?

		Cary deals forth the featureless fool 's gold of poetic commonplace .

		Dante 's `` broad stream of speech '' becomes `` copious floods of eloquence '' ;
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's '' poets , '' a `` tune - ful train . ''

		Dante says to
Virgil	PERSON	: `` May the long study avail me and the great love , which have made me search thy volume ! ''

		Vagliami il lungo studio e il grande amore Che m ` ha fatto cercar lo tuo volume .

		Cary :
May	DATE	it avail me that I long with zeal Have sought thy volume , aud with love immense Have conn 'd it o'er .

		The trailing repetition is intolerable ; nor is to seek a book the same thing as to search it .

		It would take up all the space which utmost edi - torial indulgence could allot to this review , to point out all the crimes which
Cary	ORGANIZATION	manages to commit in the three stanzas selected by
Cole	PERSON	- ridge for special praise .

		He sometimes does better , but oftener far worse .

		Chaucer and
Milton	PERSON	knew
Dante	ORGANIZATION	well , and show many traces of his influence .

		Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	must have had some acquaintance with him .

		Shakespeare sometimes says a thing in a way that makes one think of Dante , but such parallels occur everywhere when great writers touch upon the same human or # moral themes .

		Lowell asserted that
Spenser	PERSON	had read his Dante closely , but Dr.
Toynbee	PERSON	is inclined to think the resemblances , like those in Shake - speare , mere coincidences .

		Between
Milton and Coleridge	PERSON	, there are few allusions to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in the great English writers .

		If he be mentioned at all , it is likely to be with disparagement , or , what is worse , with condescension .

		In his '' Essay upon the Ancient and Modern Learn - ing , '' Sir
William Temple	PERSON	gives his list of '' the great wits among the moderns '' ; these were , in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Boccaccio	PERSON	,
Machiavel	ORGANIZATION	, and
Padre Paolo	LOCATION	; in
England	LOCATION	, Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	,
Bacon	LOCATION	, and
Selden	PERSON	.

		What names shine by their absence !

		The gen - erous shades of
Sidney	PERSON	and
Boccaccio	PERSON	might well be indignant that they also were not omit - ted from the enumeration of a critic who could forget their betters .

		Temple 's jwotege , Swift , does not mention Dante ; nor does
Addison	PERSON	, who wrote a book about his literary pilgrimage through
Italy	LOCATION	; nor yet does
Burke	PERSON	, who was so great a lover of Virgil .

		Pope and Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	show no symptoms of familiarity with the Tuscan poet , whose name does not occur in the famous life of
Milton	LOCATION	.

		To
Horace Walpole	PERSON	's jaunty philosophy , the greatest of modern poets is `` in short , a Methodist parson in Bedlam '' ; while the
Earl of Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	warns his hopeful son against wasting his time in the attempt to understand an author who is not worth the pains .


Goldsmith	PERSON	, in his `` Enquiry into the present State of Polite Learning , '' pronounces thatDante owed most of his reputation to the obscurity of the times in which he lived .

		Akenside , who in his curious ''
Ballance	PERSON	of Poets '' applies to the great poets what is known in the schools as the `` marking system , '' places

		In taste ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is marked 12 -LRB- on a scale of twenty -RRB- , with
Cervantes	PERSON	and Tasso , no one being lower except that ill-bred
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In dramatic expression ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Homer get the best mark -LRB- 18 -RRB- , while poor
Dante	PERSON	goes to the foot of the class with a mark of 8 .

		In critical ordonnance ,
Dante	PERSON	gets off with the middling mark of 12 :
Boileau	PERSON	,
Homer	ORGANIZATION	,
Sophocles	LOCATION	, and
Terence	PERSON	receiving the highest standing , while
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Ariosto	PERSON	-- careless fellows -- are '' flunked '' with a zero apiece .

		As to moral .

		Dante is placed on the same indifferent footing with
Horace	PERSON	-- who appears to have been no better than he should be , -- but is able to look down upon the inferior virtue of his compatriots ,
Tasso	PERSON	and
Ariosto	PERSON	, to say nothing of that basest of the base ,
Lucretius	PERSON	, with his zero .

		But amid all the ■ Rash judgments and the sneers of selfish men '' recorded in these
1400	DATE	pages , perhaps nothing is worthier of bad eminence than the remarks of Dr.
Thomas Warton	PERSON	in his History of En - glish Poetry : '' We are surprised that a poet should write one hundred cantos on hell , para - dise , and purgatory .

		But this prolixity is partly owing to the want of art and method , and is common to all early compositions in which every - thing is related circumstantially and without rejection , and not in those general terms which are used by modern writers . ''

		So carefully is all truth here reversed , that the sentence , stand - ing alone , might pass for a laborious effort at irony .

		Particularly to be admired is the rare excellence of modern poets which consists in the use of general terms !

		In a later age , indeed ,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, that most treacherous of critics , at - tacked
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, just as he attacked
Milton	PERSON	, in the guise of a friend .

		He did what in him lay to promote the false and superficial view which sees in Dante little to admire but the episodes of
Francesca	LOCATION	and Ugolino , and three or four others .

		Nbm ragionam di lor I In that dark age of '' enlightenment , '' Gray , in his admiration for
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, as in other things , stood almost alone .

		After
Coleridge	PERSON	had spoken , it became the fash - ion to prophesy in
Dante	LOCATION	's name , as did
Hazlitt	PERSON	without ever knowing him , and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	with better right .

		In those days every critic felt bound to come out with a parallel between
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	.

		To this whole discussion ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	contributes what seems to me the most penetrating observation :
Milton	LOCATION	, he says , '' had not the faith in things that Homer and
Dante	PERSON	had , apart from the intervention of words .

		He could not let them speak for them - selves without helping them with his learning . ''

		The year
1818	DATE	produced two memorable winged words about
Dante	PERSON	.


Coleridge	PERSON	said : '' You can - not read
Dante	ORGANIZATION	without feeling a gush of man - liness of thought within you . ''


Hallam	PERSON	said : • • His appearance made an epoch in the intel - lectual history of modern nations .

		... It was as if , at some of the ancient games , a stranger had appeared upon the plain , and thrown his quoit among the marks of former casts which tradition had ascribed to the demigods . ''


Hallam	PERSON	is inclined to prefer '' Paradise Lost '' to the `` Divine Comedy '' ; but
Macaulay	PERSON	, who knew Milton by heart , thinks Dante the superior poet .

		u He runs neck and neck with Homer , and none but
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has gone decidedly beyond him . ''

		Again : '' His execution I take to be far beyond that of any other artist who has operated on the imagination by means of words . ''

		In temperament ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	is a typical Englishman , who would have found himself very comfortable in the eighteenth century beside
Johnson	PERSON	and Akenside .

		His frank and not undiscriminating admiration for
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is there - fore significant of the immense change that had come over the English mind with respect to the vital things of poetry .

		It is quite to be ex - pected that men of spiritual insight -- such , for example , as
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, the younger
Hallam	PERSON	-LRB- he of the '' etherial brows '' -RRB- ,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	-- will be attracted to the divine Poet .

		The general impression made by this volum - inous comment is one of relative poverty .

		It is a dark mass of prejudice , error , and ignor - ance , shot through only here and there by bright flashes of insight .

		So this , we murmur , is the reaction of the great English nation upon the most spiritually inspired of modern poets !

		Even those who were most persuasive in drawing the attention of the English middle-class to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, themselves walked rather by faith than by sight .

		Coleridge ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	,
Carlyle	PERSON	say so much of true and good that the critic may well wink at the times of this ignorance .

		Carlyle has much the same fanciful Orphic mode of dealing with
Dante	PERSON	as has
Victor Hugo	PERSON	with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Much in the same way ,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	divined Homer through the cloud of the unknown tongue .

		Prob - ably these writers were just the teachers needed by their time .

		The well-known anecdote of
Robert Hall	PERSON	, employing at the last his spent strength in learning enough Italian to verify
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's parallel between
Milton	PERSON	and
Dante	PERSON	, 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, may be taken both as an example and a symbol of the effect which all this discussion was having upon the class whose chief source of literary culture for generations had been first
Milton	PERSON	and the English Bible , to which more recently had been added
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will do much to deprovincialize the English-speaking race if we ever make the vital discovery that another modern nation has produced a poet not decisively inferior to Shakespeare in size and range , and fully
Milton	PERSON	's equal in art , in piety , in loftiness of character .

		In
1850	DATE	, six years after the date chosen by Dr.
Toynbee	PERSON	for the hither limit of his collec - tion , appeared the first really adequate critical survey in English of the Tuscan poet .

		It is a pity that a somewhat undue respect for the per - formance of Cary should have induced the editor to stop short of a date that would have made it natural to ornament his collection with
Church 's Essay on Dante	ORGANIZATION	, which in absolute value far transcends all that these volumes con - tain .

		For just and sympathetic and intelligent criticism of Dante in English , no reader need go back farther than to that Essay .

		The present work , valuable as it may be historically , is only a history of the wanderings in the Wilderness , and brings one barely to the border of the
Land of Promise	ORGANIZATION	.

		Theophile Gautier somewhere observes that the human race is so wanting in originality as never to have invented more than seven deadly sins .

		He had only to read the '' Inferno '' to learn that
Dante	PERSON	himself had recognized the inadequacy of that sevenfold framework to close in all human badness .

		Dante follows the con - ventional category down to the walls of the City of Dis , whereupon he abruptly drops it , widen - ing his classification of sins with the narrowing of the bottomless pit .

		On the other hand , in the '' Purgatorio '' he finds the sevenfold divi - sion sufficient for his purpose .

		This variation has puzzled many critics , who have made rather inconclusive attempts to account for it .

		There is a legend that the composition of the '' Inferno '' was interrupted , after the completion of seven cantos , by the exile of the poet .

		Such a cir - cumstance might explain an apparent change in the scheme of the work .

		Probably most readers have been content with the feeling that too exact a parallelism between the parts would have been inartistic .

		The '' Inferno '' and the ''
Purga	PERSON	- torio '' are symmetrical , without being identical , in plan .

		In his dissertation upon the moral system of the '' Inferno , '' Mr.
Reade	PERSON	, as becomes an Oxford don , approaches the subject by the dialectical road .

		It is a very cogent piece of reasoning , bristling with quotations in Latin from St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's great theo - logical authority , from whom , as Mr.
Reade	PERSON	proves , the poet does not radically deviate .

		The learned and logical author is not lacking in trenchancy .

		He remarks that if therms , or inward criterion , of all crime must always have been one of the seven capital vices -LRB- which , by the way , are not to be confused with the seven deadly sins -RRB- , then '' iniquity seems , after all , to be a meagre profession , failing in a very marked manner to satisfy the ambition of those who find the path of virtue too narrow . ''

		Students will find this work a valuable criticism of , and sup - plement to , the essays of
Witte	PERSON	and
Moore	PERSON	on the subject .

		Not only to members of his own congregation , to each of whom Dr.

		THE DIAL 47 of original sin , by which all mankind had lost communion with God .

		This communion , even as a child , he desired above all things to regain ; but though he tried a thousand times , he never felt that u emotional or ecstatic experience '' he had been taught to expect .

		He says : i -LRB- I have often wondered , in later rears , that my faith did not give way ; that I did not become an atheist .

		It was the memory of my father , and the consistent piety of my uncle , I suppose , which made that impossible .

		But that little unplastered room under the rafters in the old farmhouse , where I lay so many nights , when the house was still , looking out through the casement upon the unpitying stars , has a story to tell of a soul in great perplexity and trouble because it could not find God . ''

		It was not till his eighteenth year that a wise friend showed him that he had but to trust in God 's love , walk in the ways of service , and confide in his friendship .

		This single word friendship has since then dominated all his religious thought .

		He sums it up in almost the last paragraph of the book : ' ■ I am fain to believe that the time is drawing near when the Christian church will be able to discern and declare the simple truth that Religion is nothing but Friendship ; friendship with God and with men .

		I have been thinking much about it in these last days , and I can not make it mean anything else ; so far as I can see , that is all there is to it .

		Religion is friendship -- friendship first with the great Companion , of whom Jesus told us , who is always nearer to us than we are to ourselves , and whose inspiration and help is the greatest fact of human experience .

		To be in harmony with his purposes , to be open to his suggestions , to be in con - scious fellowship with Him , -- this is religion on its Godward side .

		Then , turning manward , friendship sums it all up .

		To be friends with everybody ; to fill every human relation with the spirit of friendship ; is there anything more than this that the wisest and best of men can hope to do ? ''

		The consistent avowal of this faith has always put Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	among the leaders who turned away from dogma to the practical test of con - duct .

		In consequence , his right to stay in the fellowship of the church was called in question ; but as a M Sta \ '' - inner '' rather than as a '' Come - outer , '' he preferred to hold to fellowship that was dear and needful , and that , as differences once emphasized have disappeared , has grown increasingly dear .

		Of his feeling on this point he speaks very clearly : '' The duty of liberal men to stay in the churches to which they belong -- if they can be tolerated there -- and , by kindness and patience and fidelity to the truth as they see it , to do what they can to enlighten and broaden the fellowship of those churches , has always appeared to me very plain . ''

		How far such conduct on the part of a few leaders has liberalized popular opinion is illus - trated by the fact , cited in this connection , that in the early seventies Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	stood alone in a company of twenty Congregational clergy - men in feeling that it was safe to tell the people , that the verse 1
John	PERSON	, 5:7 , was admitted by i scholars to be spurious .

		Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	was for several years , from
1871	DATE	to
1875	DATE	, engaged in editorial work on the staff of '' The Independent . ''

		In that capacity he contended vigorously against '' immoral theol - ogy , '' as he unequivocally termed the Calvinistic theories .

		The issue can perhaps be best stated in the concluding words of one of his editorials , reproduced in this volume : '' For our own part we say , with all emphasis , that between such a theology as this and atheism we should promptly choose the latter . ''

		In his pulpit he has never hesitated to speak with equal directness , and in mentioning various calls to undertake educational work he expresses himself as follows : '' I do not believe that there is any place of influence in the world in which a man can be as free as in the Christian pulpit ... Unquestionably there is cowardice and subserviency in the pulpit , as everywhere else .

		But there need not be .

		... I have been saying things , with no sense of restraint , during the last fifty years , that I should not have been so likely to say if I had been a journalist or a college professor .

		... I doubt if any other kind of work would have given me so large an opportunity as my churches in
North Adams	LOCATION	and ;
Springfield	LOCATION	and
Columbus	LOCATION	have given me to speak my deepest thought .

		`` But it has not all been criticism or controversy .

		How far from it !

		The great themes of the ideal life , are , after all , the supreme interests .

		The insights , the aspirations , the convictions , the hopes , the purposes which flow into our lives from the realms about us and above us -- how much of our peace and strength depend upon them !

		These things of the Spirit are the great realities .

		The existence of that world in which our higher nature dwells and from which we draw our inspirations is not a matter of conjecture .


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	himself , the great agnostic , declared that we are more sure of the
Unknown Reality	ORGANIZATION	, out of which all physical forces and laws proceed , than we are of our own existence .

		By our scientific logic we can not define it , but we can not think without assuming it .

		And that which our scientific logic can not define is made known to us in our religious experience .

		It is with these realities of the unseen realm that our faith makes us acquainted .

		And these , after all , are the ' fountain light of all our day , the master light of all our seeing . '

		It is in the light of them that everything else gets value and significance .

		They are the only certainties . ''

		Especially the conclusion of this passage is note - worthy .

		The abiding sense of spiritual verities , together with the idea of God 's friendship , -- these two things are the cardinal points of all Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	's teaching and living .

		More than once Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	has been instru - mental in the settlement of social and political questions .

		He initiated and guided to its suc - cessful consummation the movement to amend 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the Constitution of
Ohio	LOCATION	abolishing the
October	DATE	elections .

		He also drafted the petition to Presi - dent
Roosevelt	PERSON	, in
1902	DATE	, to intervene in the coal strike .

		All facts of this sort are modestly men - tioned in this volume , but they may serve here to call attention to the deep sympathy with the working classes that has always characterized his ministry .

		On the duty of the clergy to inform themselves upon social and economic questions , he expresses himself very strongly . ''

		The plea of religious teachers that they are incom - petent to deal with social questions is a fearful self - accusation .

		They have no right to be incompetent .

		Whatever else they are ignorant of , they must not be ignorant respecting matters which concern the very life of the organization they represent ... Shall the teacher of religion confess that in the arena where char - acter is mainly lost or won , where the life of the church is at stake , where the destiny of the nation is trembling in the balance , he is unfit for efficient service ? ''

		Space forbids further consideration of this interesting and suggestive volume .

		The just and kindly characterizations of many men of distinction , the occasional flashes of humor , and the sense for diction everywhere shown , make it a book that is hard to lay aside till the last page has been read .

		But the best thing about it all is that it reveals the personality of the author .


Lewis A. Rhoades	PERSON	.

		The
Government of Cities	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Among recent substantial additions to the literature of municipal affairs are two notable books by Professors
Goodnow	PERSON	and
Munro	PERSON	, law - yers and political scientists both , who have set forth the product of recent research in that always interesting field of our '' conspicuous failure . ''

		Their purposes are distinct , but they have an important relation , and the conjunction is interesting .

		Mr.
Munro	PERSON	's three chapters are so many monographs , describing with intense concreteness and little generalization the present condition of French , Prussian , and English cities .

		Mr.
Goodnow	PERSON	, on the other hand , is analytical .

		For him , the '' city , '' whenever and wherever he can find it , is a political and admin - istrative form , whose evolution is to be traced , whose structure and functions are to be studied , that he may discover the laws of its being , the principles of its organization .

		We have long been told that , whatever the constitutional unsatisfactoriness of European * The
Government of European Cities	ORGANIZATION	.

The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		states , their cities at least are well governed .

		Mr.
Munro	PERSON	's book is intended , the author says , to provide an '' introduction to the study '' of those foreign city governments .

		About one-half the volume is given to the cities of
England	LOCATION	; the remainder , in equal portions , to those of
France	LOCATION	and
Prussia	LOCATION	.

		In each case an historical intro - duction gives us the background for our picture of the present day commune , or Stadt , or borough ; then follows an account of the repre - sentative bodies and the magistracies , their re - spective powers and their relations to each other .

		Incidentally , numerous striking features are described , to a very few of which attention may here be directed .

		A singularly valuable feature of Mr.
Munro	PERSON	's book is the discussion of elections .

		Suffrage qualifications , parties and their methods , pro- visions against corrupt practices , the calibre of men elected , -- all these and other features are treated elaborately .

		Regarding supplementary elections , required when the first ballot shows no majority or an insufficient proportion of the registration , it is perhaps a little surprising to find a preference shown for the French over the Prussian system .

		The Prussian voter must choose between the two standing highest at the first balloting ; the Frenchman is free , and may even elect , by a mere plurality , one not men - tioned at the first ballot .

		However , he concludes that in both cases equally the system encourages a first ballot that is scattering and ineffectual , inconsiderable factions making such showing as they can to win recognition from the favorities .

		The protection of the voter 's independence by a secret ballot , he shows to be utterly wanting in
Prussia	LOCATION	; with the result -LRB- partly due to other causes -RRB- that abstention is an evil of serious pro- portions .

		In
France	LOCATION	, he says , the ballot is secret only when the voter `` troubles to make it so , '' and apparently it is made a matter of trouble to him .

		The American reader can not fail to be struck with the shortness of the ballot abroad .

		The annual choice of a councillor or two , possibly a prominent executive officer also , is an electoral task which the voter can be expected to perform with some degree of satisfaction .

		It is feared that much of the '' intelligent vote '' in
America	LOCATION	would wander , hopelessly lost , on our vast blanket-ballots , but for the convenient party emblem .

		In these days of legislation by statute or constitution as the cure-all for our municipal pains , it will be wholesome to reflect that the change in English boroughs , from
1832	DATE	when conditions were `` about as bad as they could well be , '' to the admired present , was wrought by an alteration in
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 the '' spirit not the form of local administration , ' for the organs of municipal government ... are now almost exactly the same in structure and in functions as they were before
1835	DATE	. ''

		Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	has long been regarded as an expert in municipal affairs ; in lecture , text - book , scientific treatise , and commission report , he has been forming opinion and solving prob - lems with increasing influence and authority .

		AYe suspect that college classes may be disap - pointed in his present book .

		His paragraphs do not lend themselves readily to analysis and orderly grouping ; the paragraph headings are useless and often misleading ; the argument is sometimes obscurely developed .

		But it is not as text-writer that we value Mr.
Goodnow	PERSON	; rather is he an expert , whose opinions we must have and shall rely on .

		And the book is crammed with suggestive comment , comparison , conclu - sion .

		After introducing us to the phenomena of urban life generally , he devotes several chap - ters to an historical exposition of the thesis that cities have progressively played their part as -LRB- 1 -RRB- city-states , -LRB- 2 -RRB- mere administrative districts of states , -LRB- 3 -RRB- local political beings , having needs of their own and requiring organization adapted to those needs .

		At once we are in the presence of the problem with which our author seems to be constantly preoccupied : viz. , municipal home - rule .

		It is interesting to observe that he regards home rule as desirable , not in itself and of course , but only where populations are fit to be entrusted with the right to vary municipal policy , and when municipal policy may be varied without detriment to the state .

		Centralization , he has told us before , may be legislative or administra - tive .

		He now observes that
England	LOCATION	has for some years past been experimenting with the continental method , and has found that this substitution of administrative for legislative control , instead of repressing local life , has '' been accompanied by a great increase '' in municipal activity .

		He distinctly favors a further introduction of administrative control among us .

		He believes that '' the legislature must in the nature of things be a partisan po - litical body , '' and , as we should readily agree , administrative control stands a better chance of being firm , consistent , and expert .

		The author is well persuaded that
America	LOCATION	is wrong in the method by which she distributes powers to municipalities .

		Enumeration of powers granted by the legislature , and strict limitation to those powers by the judiciary , -- the municipal corporation on the same plane with any private corporation , bearing the burden of that hostile presumption which public welfare requires that the ordinary corporation shall bear , -- this arrangement is inconvenient and unjust to cities ; for the latter are public rather than private bodies , and the first requisite for the public welfare is that their powers shall be adequate .

		The
Continental	ORGANIZATION	method is preferred , endowing cities with powers by general grant , limited only at need by general legislation , or more conveniently by the devices of administra - tive control , a system which affords sufficient safeguards but allows free growth according to varying circumstances .

		Having thus dealt with the position of the city in the modern state , Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	devotes a chapter each to the Executive , the
Council	ORGANIZATION	, and the Participation of the People ; and then a chapter each to the five great admin - istrative departments of Police , Charities and Correction , Education , Local Improvements , and
Finance	ORGANIZATION	.

		He holds that the city electorate in the
United States	LOCATION	is not properly safeguarded , and has doubts , therefore , of the general utility of the municipal referendum .

		As to the city legislature , it is interesting to observe that '' both practical men and theorists ... are tending towards a partial rehabilitation of the municipal council . ''

		The commission system has this important characteristic , that in con - centrating legislative and administrative author - ity in the same hands it wholly abandons the idea of the separation of powers in city gov - ernment .

		That principle had never been appli - cable , and the attempt to secure it was found by bitter experience to be `` most disastrous . ''

		The official system and the organization of its mem - bers presents a very difficult problem , whose discussion brings in valuable incidental remarks on several features of administration in general , e. g. t tenure of office , removal for cause , appoint - ment by competitive examination .

		A properly organized administration must show , -LRB- 1 -RRB- amen - ability to popular control , -LRB- 2 -RRB- administrative efficiency .

		The German system sacrifices the former to the latter , the American vice versa .

		The English system -LRB- to which the author con - stantly displays strong leanings -RRB- secures both in a high degree .

		The English administrative officer is well paid , and is thus supplied with a motive for becoming expert ; he is protected in office not so much by law as by public opinion ; there is an antidote to bureaucracy in his legal position , for he is under , and not superior to , the council com mittee , the non-expert element of the system .

		Upon the form of the headship of departments conflict has long raged between the advocates of 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the board plan and the single-commissioner plan .

		Granting that the latter secures greater responsibility , and expecting to be branded as '' heretical , '' Professor
Goodnow	PERSON	argues for the board plan , -LRB- 1 -RRB- from English and German ex - perience generally , -LRB- 2 -RRB- from our own experience in educational administration , -LRB- 3 -RRB- because it se - cures greater permanence of tenure in the heads of departments , boards being only gradually re - newed from year to year , -LRB- 4 -RRB- because '' it is the only form ... which makes permanently pos - sible popular non-professional administration , '' that is , that participation of laymen in adminis - tration which he admiringly observes on such a wide scale in
Prussia	LOCATION	under
Gneist	ORGANIZATION	's influence .

		Finally , a word must be said as to the rela - tion of municipalities to public services , the ab - sorbing political issue of '' municipal trading . ''

		European opinion is almost unanimous that cities should '' under proper limitations have the power to enter upon the field of municipal ownership and operation , and even in the
United States	LOCATION	opinion is gradually coming to approximate the opinion of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' though as yet few American cities have the requisite legal powers .

		Local regulation of transportation services has often proved unsatisfactory , partly because of the in - adequate legal powers of cities , partly because of inefficiency and corruption in their govern - ments .

		Possibly for this part of the problem a proper solution has been found in the state commission , already used to good effect by
New York	LOCATION	and some few other states .

		But in other departments , lighting , housing , etc. , the sphere of direct municipal activity is gradually extend - ing .

		Private parties can often render better service at less cost , but the question is not only economic ; it is social . ''

		It is wise to endure a slight waste in processes of production in order to secure greater equality in distribution or a greater regard for general social needs . ''

		As the sewers have been universally municipalized , so are water - works generally ; and other services will probably follow the same way .

		In every case the city must sit down first and count the cost , for what it gains in general social conven - ience it must pay for , often not from dividends , but in taxes .

		This absolutely requires that realization of the community of interest between voters and tax-payers that is so essential to so - cial peace , and yet so far from obvious or easy to secure .

		It was easy and natural , perhaps , in primitive times .

		It is extremely difficult in these days of highly concentrated wealth and vast voting but property-less populations .

E. Spencer	PERSON	.

		Recent Poetry .

		* When a poet has '' climbed to the snows of age , '' his voice may lose something of its warmth and richness , but acquire in their place the note of prophecy . ''

		From labours through the
night	TIME	, outworn , Above the hills the front of morn , We see , whose eyes to heights are raised , And the world 's wise may deem us crazed .

		While yet her lord lies under seas , She takes us as the wind the trees ' Delighted leafage ; all in song We mount to her , to her belong . ''

		There is little need to name
George Meredith	PERSON	as the author of these lines , or of the following equally characteristic quatrains : '' Once I was part of the music I heard On the boughs or sweet between earth and sky , For joy of the beating of wings on high My heart shot into the breast of the bird . ''

		I hear it now and I see it fly And a life in wrinkles again is stirred , My heart shoots into the breast of the bird , As it will for sheer love till the last long sigh . ''

		These examples from the precious sheaf of Mere - dith 's '' Last Poems '' vividly recall the brave free spirit that winged its flight a few months ago .

		Sev - eral of the poems offer retrospective pictures of the Napoleonic days at which
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	's imagination always took fire . ''

		Their facts are going headlong on the tides , Like commas on a line of History 's page ; Nor that which once they took for Truth abides , Save in the form of youth enlarged from age .

		`` Meantime give ear to woodland notes around , Look on our
Earth	LOCATION	full-breasted to the sun : So was it when their poets heard the sound , Beheld the scene : in them our days are one . ''

		THE DIAL 51
Nelson	PERSON	and Trafalgar are the subjects of two noble poems , and the moral drawn from these historical musings is thus convincingly put : '' Our cry for cradled Peace , while men are still The three-parts brute which smothers the divine .

		Heaven answers : Guard it with forethoughtful will , Or buy it ; all your gains from War resign .

		• • A land , not indefensibly alarmed , May see , unwarned by hint of friendly gods , Between a hermit crab at all points armed , And one without a shell , decisive odds . ''


Ireland	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	receive generous tributes in this volume .

		The stanzas upon u The Centenary of
Garibaldi	LOCATION	'' come to this splendid close : ■ ' Down the long roll of History will run The story of these deeds , and speed his race Beneath defeat more hotly to embrace The noble cause and trust to another sun . ''

		And lo , that sun is in
Italia	LOCATION	's skies This day , by grace of his good sword in part .

		It beckons her to keep a warrior heart For guard of beauty , all too sweet a prize .

		• • Earth gave him : blessed be the
Earth	LOCATION	that gave .

		Earth Master crowned his honest work on earth :
Proudly Italia	ORGANIZATION	names his place of birth : The bosom of Humanity his grave . ''

		The stately lines for the
Milton	LOCATION	tercentenary also call for thankful mention , and we reluctantly refrain from quoting a part of them .

		Enough has been said to show that these new poems are much more than crumbs swept from the Meredithian board ; they constitute indeed a substantial addition to the poet 's finer work .

		Mrs.
William Sharp	PERSON	has made a selection from the poems of her late husband , drawing upon the five volumes published under his own name , for the purpose of supplying a companion to the volume which he published under the assumed name of ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	. ''

		A few poems never before brought into book form are added to the closing section .

		One of these later poems , '' On a Night - ingale in
April	DATE	, '' may be taken for our illustration of a poet whose sweet and wistful song has qualities that repay a close examination . ''

		The yellow moon is a dancing phantom Down secret ways of the flowing shade ; And the waveless stream has a murmuring whisper Where the alders wave . ''

		Not a breath , not a sigh , save the slow stream 's whisper : Only the moon is a dancing blade That leads a host of the Crescent warriors To a phantom raid .

		• ' Out of the Lands of Faerie a summons , A long , strange cry that thrills through the glade : -- The grey-green glooms of the elm are stirring , Newly afraid .

		u Last heard , white music , under the olives Where once Theocritus sang and played -- Thy Thracian song is the old new wonder O moon-white maid ! '' '

		Since several of Sharp 's volumes are now out of print , this selection of the best in all of them is highly acceptable , coming , as it does , from the hands of the person most competent to make it .

		The last work done by
Eugene Lee	PERSON	-
Hamilton	PERSON	took the form of a cycle of twenty-nine sonnets conse - crated to the memory of his lost child who died when but two years old .

		u Minima Bella '' he caressingly called her , and that is the title given to the poems in which she is enshrined .

		The one which we quote , beautiful and impressive as it is , offers only a fair average example of the extraor - dinary series to which it belongs . ''

		Mantled in purple dusk , Imperial Death .

		Thy throne
Time	ORGANIZATION	's mist , thy crown the clustered stars .

		Thy orb the world ; -- did Nature 's countless wars Yield insufficient incense for thy breath ' ? ''

		Hadst not enough with all who troop beneath Thy inward-opening gates , whose shadowy bars Give back nor kings in their triumphal cars , Nor the worn throngs that old age hurrieth ' ?

		• '' sateless Death , most surely it was thou .

		-LRB- A thousand ages , yea , and longer still , Before the words were heard in
Galilee	LOCATION	-RRB- '' That saidst with dark contraction of thy brow , While through all Nature ran an icy chill : • Now let the little children come to me ? ' ''

		The pathos of these poems is almost intolerable , but it is redeemed and sanctified by their loveliness .

		The cycle is a worthy pendant to those '' Sonnets of the Wingless Hours '' which first revealed to the world the full stature of this poet .

		The present volume is edited by his widow , who contributes a few pages of biographical notes .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's '' New Poems '' include the sting - ing and indiscreet verses to '' The Woman with a Serpent 's Tongue '' that recently provided the jour - nalism of two nations with a nine days ' sensation .

		The volume contains much other matter far worthier of attention , and notably -- since the author is now a visitor to these shores -- a stately invocation '' To the Invincible Republic , '' from which we take pleas - ure in producing the central passage . ''

		And as thou art vast , So are thy perils vast , that evermore In thine own house are bred ; nor least of these That fair and fell
Delilah	LOCATION	,
Luxury	ORGANIZATION	, That shears the hero 's strength away , and brings Palsy on nations .

		Flee her loveliness , For in the end her kisses are a sword .

		Strong sons hast thou begotten , natures rich In scorn of riches , greatly simple minds : No land in all the world hath memories Of nobler children : let it not be said That if the peerless and the stainless one , The man of
Yorktown	LOCATION	and of Valley Forge , -- Or he of tragic doom , thy later born , He of the short plain word that thrilled the world And freed the bondman .

		-- let it not be said That if to-day these radiant ones returned , They would behold thee changed beyond all thought From that austerity wherein thy youth Was nurtured , those large habitudes of soul . ''

		These lines will illustrate Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's chief poetic gift -- an aptitude for the fitting characterization of significant men and events .

		When he attempts 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, this task , he is always restrained and dignified , provided only his theme is far enough removed from the passions of his own time and environment .

		His '' Purple East '' sonnets , and his denunciation of the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	, were marred by over - vehemence and cloudiness of judgment .

		Probably this should be said also of the present lines upon the late King of
Belgium	LOCATION	, although their effectiveness is not to be denied . ''

		No zeal , no Faith inspired this
Leopold	PERSON	, Nor any madness of half-splendid birth , Merely he loosed the hounds that rend and slay That he might have his fill of loathsome gold .

		Embalm him ,
Time !	ORGANIZATION

		Forget him not , Earth !

		Trumpet his name , and flood his deeds with day ! ''

		A group of seventeen '' Sonnets to Miranda , '' clearly of the nature of a personal confession , forms a con - spicuous feature of this volume .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	is not so happy when he affects playfulness , for his gambols are rather like those of a dancing bear .

		Vivacity is not his affair , and his efforts to be sprightly do not exactly come off .

		But , despite his misguided experi - ments , he remains one of the noblest of our living poets -- a fact strangely forgotten by those who have recently been overwhelming him with vituperation .

		The '' New Poems '' of Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	seem to be the product of about ten years -- at least they go back to the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Most of them are pretty futilities , although now and then a simple , sincere strain appeals to us in the deeper fashion .

		Such a strain is heard in '' The Cry of the Little Peoples . '' ''

		The Cry of the Little Peoples went up to God in vain ; The Czech , and the Pole , and the
Finn	PERSON	, and the Schleswig Dane . ''

		We ask but a little portion of the green , ambitious earth ; Only to sow and sing and reap in the land of our birth . ''

		A rather striking story -LRB- with a moral -RRB- is told in the '' Ballad of the Sinful Lover . '' ''

		Four years he sinned , because she died -- With base corroding anodyne He numbed the noble pain in him , Four years he herded with the swine .

		`` And then at last he died , and went , With hurry of immortal feet , To seek in the Eternal Life The face that he had died to meet . ''

		Up all the stairways of the sky Laughing he ran , at every door Of the long corridors of heaven He knocked , and cried out ' Heliodore ! ' ''

		In shining rooms sat the sweet saints , Each at her little task of joy ; Old eyes , all young again with heaven , Watched angel girl and angel boy . ''

		And o'er the fields of
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, Scattered like flowers , the lovers passed All rainbows -- saying each to each
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's two words : ' At last !

		At last ! ' ''

		But
Heliodore	PERSON	would have nothing of the sinner , which is the moral already referred to .

		It takes courage to write an epic nowadays , but Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, greatly daring , has essayed no less a task , and carried it to triumphant success .

		His subject is ''
Drake	PERSON	, '' probably the greatest epic theme that English history can offer , and his poem is a full-blooded composition of such high and sus - tained interest that it makes breathless reading , and causes us almost to forget that we are dealing with a supposedly outworn literary form .

		It culminates , of course , in the defeat of the Armada , and its heightened diction may be adequately illustrated by this passage : '' None but the everlasting voice Of him who fought at Salamis might sing The fight of that dread Sabbath .

		Not mankind Waged it alone .

		War waged in heaven that day , Where
Michael	PERSON	and his angels drave once more The hosts of darkness ruining down the abyss Of Chaos .

		Light against darkness , Liberty Against all dark old despotism , unsheathed The sword in that great hour .

		Behind the strife Of men embattled deeps beyond all thought Moved in their awful panoply , as move Silent , invisible , swift , under the clash Of waves and flash of foam , huge ocean glooms And vast reserves of inappellable power .

		The bowsprits ranked on either fore-front seemed But spear-heads of those dread antagonists Invisible : the shuddering sails of
Spain	LOCATION	Dusk with the shadow of death , the sunward sails Of
England	LOCATION	full-fraught with the breath of God . ''

		This noble poem is almost worthy to be named in the same breath with
Swinburne	PERSON	's magnificent ode upon the same subject , and it was , indeed , completed just in time to greet the eye of the master now dead , and to win his unstinted praise .

		The '' Collected Poems of the late
Arthur Upson	PERSON	'' are published in two dignified and almost sumptuous volumes , with an editorial introduction by Professor
Richard Burton	PERSON	.

		From this introduction we learn that the poet was born in
Camden	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, in
1877	DATE	, that he was busily writing at the tender age of nine , that in
1894	DATE	he removed to
St. Paul	LOCATION	and entered
the University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	, that his college life was suspended from
1896	DATE	to
1900	DATE	on account of ill health , that it was finally resumed and all but com - pleted , that in
1906	DATE	he was appointed an instructor in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and that in
1908	DATE	, at the age of thirty-one , he was drowned from his boat in a
Minne	LOCATION	- sota lake .

		We may hardly say of him , in view of the volume and value of his accomplished perform - ance , that he is to be classed with '' the inheritors of unfilled renown ; '' but we may express a more than perfunctory regret that the springs of a fountain of beauty should have been sealed in such untimely and tragic fashion .

		The evidence is clear in these two volumes that their author was a poet of the kind that can transmute all experience into beauty , and that our literature suffered no ordinary loss in his death .

		He had not become widely known , although no less than seven volumes of his verse were published before he died , and he had won the esteem of those whose business it is to keep themselves informed con - cerning the poetic movement .

		Aldrich , for example once wrote : '' I am afraid he is too fine for mime ' mo. -RSB- THE DIA1 , 53 diate popularity ; but that does n't matter .

		It is not the many but the few that give a man his place in literature .

		The many are engaged canning meat and manipulating pious life insurance companies . ''

		Certainly he was not one of the '' Failures '' char - acterized in his fine sonnet thus entitled . ''

		They bear no laurels on their sunless brows , Nor anght within their pale hands as they go ; They look as men accustomed to the slow And level onward course ` neath drooping boughs .

		Who may these be no trumpet doth arouse , These of the dark processionals of woe , Unpraised , unblamed , but whom sad Acheron 's flow Monotously lulls to leaden drowse ?

		These are the Failures .

		Clutched by Circumstance , They were -- say not too weak !

		-- too ready prey To their own fear whose fixed Gorgon glance Made them as stone for aught of great essay ; -- Or else they nodded when their Master-Chance Wound his one signal , and went on his way . ''

		Of the thirty-three stanzas that bloom '' In an Oxford Garden '' we cull two of the fairest . ''

		Some dust of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	eddies round us yet .

		Some clay o ' the Garden , clinging in the breast , Down near the heart yet bides unmanifest .

		Last eve in gardens strange to me I let The path lead far ; and , lo , my vision met Old , forfeit hopes .

		I , as on homeward quest .

		By recognizing trees was bidden rest , And pitying leaves looked down and sighed , ' Forget . ' '' ''

		A great nelumbo heavy on the breast Of heaven 's tranquil lake must be the moon Above this garden in the still night 's noon , Bending the gold of her refulgent crest .

		Thns to the surface of these days of rest Through all my absent idlesse , late and soon , The thought of you doth blossom and the boon Of the dear face that waits me down the
West	LOCATION	.

		* ' As an example of the pure lyric , it would not be easy to match the following : '' Flame at the core of the world , And flame in the red rose-tree ; The one is the fire of the ancient spheres , The other is Junes to be ; And , oh , there 's a flame that is both their flames Here at the heart of me ! ''

		As strong as the fires of stars , As the prophet rose-tree true , The fire of my life is tender and wild , Its beauty is old and new ; For out of the infinite past it came With the love in the eyes of you ! ''

		The range of this poet is wide , and he finds inspira - tion alike under home and alien skies .

		Many of his pieces are occasional or tributary , fancies elab - orated at sight of some quaint object or compelling monument , at thought of some noble deed or heroic soul .

		He has the Midas touch that turns every - thing to gold .

		And often , when some matter of deep human concern compels his imagination , his utterance becomes prophetic .

		His fine sonnet on `` The Statue of Liberty -LRB-
New York Harbour	LOCATION	, A. D. 2900 -RRB- '' sounds a needed note of warning to an over-complacent nation . ''

		Here once , the records show , a land whose pride Abode in Freedom 's watchword !

		And once here The port of traffic for a hemisphere , With great gold-piling cities at her side !

		Tradition says , superbly once did bide Their sculptured goddess on an island near , With hospitable smile and torch kept clear For all wild hordes that sought her o'er the tide .

		'T was centuries ago .

		But this is true : Late the fond tyrant who misrules our land , Bidding his serfs dig deep in marshes old , Trembled , not knowing wherefore , as they drew From out this swampy bed of ancient mould A shattered torch held in a mighty hand . ''

		Thia is worthy to be set beside
Aldrich	PERSON	's no finer son - net , `` Unguarded Gates . ''

		The more we delve within this quarry , the more we bring treasure-trove to the surface .

		Sweetness and light , intelligence and spirituality , are here , and always united with a fluent and admirable technique .

		Two of the longer poems are dramatic in form , and a third of this kind , ''
Gauvaine	PERSON	of the Retz , '' went down with the poet in his
Lake Spezzia	LOCATION	of
Minnesota	LOCATION	.

		We have space only to quote the gnomic lines which end `` The Tides of
Spring	DATE	, '' a dramatic romance of ancient
Scotland	LOCATION	. ''

		I think each soul spins wisely as he may , And God , who weaves the garment of this life , Draws tight the meshes of our crossing threads , And bleaches in the sunshine of His love . '' ''

		The Poems of
William Winter	ORGANIZATION	'' again offer us an example of a poet 's collected life-work , in this case , however , of one whose chief distinction is that of the essayist and dramatic critic , and , happily , of one who in advanced age still lives to exemplify unchilled sensibilities and undimmed intellectual vigor .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's poetical output has been con - siderable , and even this large volume includes only the author 's final selection from a much larger mass of material .

		He is an adept in the facile old - fashioned rhythms , and is most felicitous when pay - ing tribute to some great spirit or mourning the loss of some cherished friend .

		His feelings '' At Shake - speare 's Grave '' are thus expressed : ' '' Here the divinest of all thoughts descended : Here the sweet heavens their sweetest boon let fall : Upon this hallowed ground began and ended The life that knew , and felt , and uttered all . ''

		It is a commonplace thought , perhaps , but one made beautiful by sincerity of feeling .

		From the '' Coronal for Stedman '' -- a fifty years ' associate -- we take these stanzas : '' Thy soul is music : from its deeps o'erflowing , -- With the glad freedom of the wild-bird 's wing , Where icy gales o ` er sunlit seas are blowing , -- It sings because divinely born to sing . ''

		No stain is on thy banner : grandly streaming , Its diamond whiteness leads the tuneful host , Forever in the front of honor beaming , And they that knew thee best must love thee most . ''

		This singer 's wonted garb is that of a graceful and tender melancholy , and it becomes him well .

		Possi - bly a bit too sentimental or lachrymose in his strain , he is nevertheless a warm-hearted and appealing 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, poet , whose voice we would not willingly miss from the chorus of the now swiftly-dying generation .

		And it is a voice that has never been raised , either in verse or prose , save for things lovely and of good report .

		The poems collected under the title of '' The Soul 's Inheritance '' were prepared for publication by
George Cabot Lodge	ORGANIZATION	just before his death .

		They are eight in number , and embody a novel structural plan .

		In each case , the main body of the poem -LRB- usually in heroic verse -RRB- is followed by a group of three sonnets , rounding out the thought .

		Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	dwelt in an atmosphere of large abstractions , typified by such lines as these : '' Sun , moon , and stars -- inviolate firmament -- Phases of earth 's inveterate alchemy Of life and death -- profound tranquillities , Thunders and trepidations of the sea -- How often have you been to man in spirit A liberation and an ecstasy !

		How often has the soul gone forth with you , As with the tide , a stranded caravel Issues by noble estuaries , impelled By streaming winds and led by the low sun , Into the light , into the infinite spaces ! ''

		Such verse as this is dignified , but hardly escapes the charge of being turgid also .

		One of the poems , `` Love in Life , '' is written mostly in octosyllabics , and we quote the concluding sonnet for the sake of the unwonted measure . ''

		I saw her sandals of grave gold Move on the marble , soft as light , Her motion was like birds in flight ; The bountiful , the new , the old Deep secret that no tongue has told Was born of her -- as is the white First flame of day-break from the
night	TIME	.

		As song-birds wake , as flowers unfold .

		And then I kissed her sandals of Grave gold , and kissed her hands and mouth ; And knew how more serene than song , How spacious and how strong is Love !

		-- Spacious as thought is of the truth ; Strong as the conscious soul is strong . ''

		Two of these poems are occasional -- one written for the Phi Beta Kappa Society , the other for a Forefather 's Day celebration .

		* Mr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	is a felicitous writer of occasional and personal verse , and we take pleasure in extracting from his new volume , `` The White Bees , '' two of the four stanzas which he read at the funeral of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	. ''

		The blue of springtime in your eyes Was never quenched by pain ; And winter brought your head the crown Of snow without a stain .

		The poet 's mind , the prince 's heart , You kept until the end , Nor ever faltered in your work .

		Nor ever failed a friend . ''

		You followed , through the quest of life , The light that shines above The tumult and the toil of men , And shows us what to love .

		Right loyal to the best you knew , Reality or dream , You ran the race , you fought the fight , A follower of the Gleam . ''

		From Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	we have two new volumes .

		In '' The Giant and the Star '' he works a new and charming vein , for the book is a collection of poems which view the world with the eyes of a child . ''

		Whenever on the windowpane I hear the fingers of the rain , And in the old trees , near the door , The wind that whispers more and more , Bright in the light made by the lamp I make myself a hunter 's carnp . ''

		The shadows of the desk and chairs Are trees and woods : the corners , lairs Where wolves and wildcats lie in wait For anyone who walks too late ; Upon my knees with my toy-gun I hunt and slaughter many a one . ''

		This is an excursion into
Stevenson	PERSON	's own child garden , and there are others equally awesome in their suggested possibilities .

		There are also accounts of ''
Toyland	LOCATION	'' and '' The Land of Candy , '' which should make any child 's eyes and mouth water .

		We are a little dubious about the pieces in which `` The Boy Next Door '' figures , for the youth seems to be a graceless iconoclast .

		`` And he said that Old King
Cole	PERSON	Was a fraud upon the whole ; Never had a fiddler That could fiddle any where By the side of him ; and joked While he drank the vilest brew From a cracked old bowl ; and smoked Worse tobacco ; smiling , too . ''

		Cinderella , too !

		why , she Was a slomp ; just naturally Would n't work ; and had big feet -- Could bave seen them ` cross the street .

		Did n't marry a Prince at all , But the ashman .

		Never at Court Or a ball !

		She had her gall To put that in her report ! ''

		Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's '' New Poems '' is an English edition , from which we infer than the poems may not all be new for American readers .

		But many of them certainly are , such as the '' North Star '' series of sonnets , and the centenary tributes to
Poe	PERSON	and
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		We quote one of the sonnets . ''

		There is a place among the
Cape Ann	LOCATION	hills That looks from fir-dark summits on the sea , Whose surging sapphire changes constantly Beneath deep heavens , morning windowsills With golden calm , or sunset citadels With storm , whose towers the winds ' confederacy And bandit thunder hold in rebel fee , Swooping upon the fisher 's sail that swells .

		A place where Sorrow ceases to complain , And Life 's old cares put all their burdens by , And Weariness forgets itself in rest .

		Would that all life were like it ; might obtain Its pure repose , its outlook , strong and high , That sees , beyond , far Islands of the Blest . ''

		In such work as this , and some other that we have observed of late , Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	seems to be acquiring the touch of virility which has hitherto been lacking in his work , -- to be no longer satisfied with the rich imagery and melodic loveliness that formerly suf - ficed him .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 55 Being on the spot , and a poet of approved worth , it was fitting that Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	should write the '' Song for the Ter-Centenary of
Lake Cham	LOCATION	- plain '' to grace the celebration of
last July	DATE	.

		His poem is in quatrains -- numbering thirty-two -- and the hero is thus characterized : ''
Roland	PERSON	and
Bayard !	PERSON

		-- he was kin to these ; Swerved he no more than magnet from the pole As forth he sailed upon the uncharted seas With dreams of high adventure in his soul . ''

		What foes he faced , what dangers dread he dared , -- Patient in peace , in war unwavering !

		Unmoved he toiled , unmurmuring he fared , Like saintly
Louis	LOCATION	, the beloved king .

		• ' Since then the great Recorder of the Days Thousands has scrolled upon his golden book , Yet still a sheet of shimmering chxysophrase The great lake spreads for whomsoe'er may look . ''

		In -
Pro Patria	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	gives us a score of pieces , ballads , and lyrics , upon themes belonging to American history .

		We quote some simple verses upon
Lafayette	LOCATION	.

		• ' He left the pleasant primrose-bowers , The paths of ease , He sought a soldier 's arduous hours Far o'er the seas . ''

		* Within his high , impulsive heart Burned freedom 's flame , And he espoused the patriots ' part With ardent aim .

		• ' He fought unfaltering till the end .

		-- The goal , -- was won ; The fearless and the faithful friend Of
Washington	LOCATION	. ''

		Correct in sentiment , but hardly more than mechani - cal , Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	's verses may be allowed a humble niche in the temple of our patriotic minstrelsy .


William Morton Payxe	PERSON	.

		Briefs ox Xew Books .

		A philoiophet the unobviout Judged according to President Had - ley 's recent definition of culture -- `` the opposite of absorption in the obvious '' -- Mr.
Gilbert K. Chesterton	PERSON	is one of the most cultured of mortals .

		It is the unobvious that he sees in ever -RCB- - incident , in every commonplace ob - ject , in every person : his whole life , indeed , seems to be passed in absorption in the unobvious .

		His latest book , '' Tremendous Trifles '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is made up of thirty-nine short talks on the unsuspected significance of common things . ''

		Let us exercise the eye , '' exhorts the author , '' until it learns to see the startling facts that run across the landscape as plain as a painted fence .

		Let us be ocular athletes .

		Let us learn to write essays on a stray cat or a coloured cloud . ''

		The commonest things , in his hands , become fruitful of suggestion and instruction and entertainment .

		Once he planned to write a book of poems about the things in his pockets ; but he found it would be too long , and the age of the great epics is past .

		In one chapter we have metaphysics , '' the only thoroughly emotional thing , '' in an animated inquiry into the meaning of Certainty -- even more baffling to Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	than the meaning of Truth to some of his contem - poraries .

		Amusing , to those acquainted with the author , must be his conception of himself as a pigmy viewing the smallest objects as things of vast bulk .

		He aspires not to climb high mountains and over - look the kingdoms of the earth . ''

		I will lift up my eyes to the hills , from whence cometh my help , '' he declares ; u but I will not lift up my carcass to the hills , unless it is absolutely necessary , '' a not un - natural resolution , considering his weight and bulk .

		These hasty sketches , reprinted from the
London	LOCATION	' • Daily News , '' are not uniformly admirable or in - teresting , -- in fact , they contain pages of whimsical trifling wherein the author seems to be writing only to fill his allotted space ; but they also contain obser - vations and reflections that are so fresh , so droll , so shrewd , or so suggestive , as to make the book well worth reading .

		™ .

		* _ , • .

		The main thesis of the stimulating and weakne ** book by `` A Diplomatist , on our of diplomacy .

		`` American Foreign Policy '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , is that '' A purely defensive diplomacy on the part of a great state is as much a heresy as is a navy built only for defense . ''

		We are open , says the author , to attack in two quarters --
South America	LOCATION	and the
Orient	LOCATION	; yet we are without allies .

		For a century we were indifferent to foreign intercourse ; but the acquisition of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, which are a source of diplomatic and military weakness , has put us in the same position as other nations with Asiatic possessions , and we must imitate their policies .

		This can be done without an absolute abandonment of our traditional policy of no entangling alliances .

		The problem is to find a desirable partner for mutual insurance , with no conflicting interests .

		Our dearest foreign policy , the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, is as likely to be attacked in
Manila	LOCATION	as in the
Caribbean	LOCATION	.

		Dip - lomacy would be a far better means of defense than an enormous military establishment .

		The history of
England	LOCATION	in
Egypt	LOCATION	is a case in point .

		She first secured the consent of disinterested nations , and finally that of
France	LOCATION	, which at first viewed this policy through the cannon 's sight .


Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	are the nations most likely to attack the
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine ; but at present the latter is in no position to do so .

		If we could now secure the assent of
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, while
Italy	LOCATION	is weak , she would not later dare to oppose us .

		In this way also
Germany	LOCATION	and her ally -LRB-
Austria	LOCATION	-RRB- might be check-mated .

		That is .

		something like this might be done , if we did not recklessly throw away every pawn .

		A bit of African jungle is no tempting for - eign possession , but it might be valuable to cede for just such recognition of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	as has been suggested .

		Yet we foolishly declined to take shares in the Morrocan bank .

		Likewise we failed to lay
Japan	LOCATION	under any obligation to us , though we were decidedly friendly toward her in the recent 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, war with
Russia	LOCATION	and were the first to abandon the legation at
Seoul	LOCATION	.

		Now it is our turn to ask favors , and we have nothing on the other side of the ledger .

		The
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	defines our policy toward
Europe	LOCATION	in South American affairs , but it is a nega - tive policy on our part toward that region itself .

		It is now time to develop an active South American policy , -- or , rather , two policies .

		South of the Orinoco our policy should be that of disinterested friendliness ; north of that region it should be to maintain a sort of suzerainty .

		The latter might be called our
Caribbean	LOCATION	policy , as it must apply to all territory in that region .

		The
Piatt	PERSON	amendment was only a foolish tying of hands in
Cuba	LOCATION	to put off the inevitable .

		Such , in outline , is the foreign policy which '' A Diplomatist '' sets before us .

		It is not a pleasant prospect to contemplate , but we must con - fess that the author 's reasoning is not altogether illogical , if our faces are to remain set as they are at present .

		Those who remember
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's oflapal
Rome	LOCATION	, vigorous condemnation of papal mis - government , recorded in his journal in
1848	DATE	, will turn with lively interest to
Signor R. de Cesare	PERSON	's `` Last Daysof Papal Rome '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , in order to study in more detail the features of Roman administration , and to discover whether Pius IX .

		had mitigated the evils of priestly rule which the English traveller summed up in the sen - tence , '' Old women above , liars and cheats below -- that is the Papal administration . ''

		The subject has also a larger interest , because it is the fall of a princely power , the beginnings of which run back to the last days of the Roman empire .

		The spectacle of such a fall has deep dramatic significance .

		It was something more than a tragic close of an ancient rule ; it was the vanishing of the final barrier to the completion of the great task of Italian unification .

		Signor de
Cesare	ORGANIZATION	's treatment ignores none of these elements of interest ; but it has other claims upon our attention .

		To the student of types of character , it offers that finer kind of gossip out of which one is able to gain impressions of the personality of the principal actors in the drama , --
Pius IX.	PERSON	,
Cardinal Antonelli	PERSON	, the
Duke of Sermoneta	ORGANIZATION	, and of Mgr .

		de Merode .

		Some of de
Cesare	ORGANIZATION	's stories of Pius IX .

		remind one of those told by
Grant Duff	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Pope certainly had a sense of humor , which occasionally found strange manifestations .

		For example , after
Mentana	PERSON	he received the victors over
Garibaldi	LOCATION	by declaiming `` in a loud voice the first octave of ' Gerusalemme Liberata , ' to the great amusement of all present '' ; and in
1870	DATE	, an hour after the white flag had been raised over the
Porta Pia	LOCATION	, he `` re - sumed his easy good-humor , and , seating himself at his writing-table , composed in all tranquillity a charade in three verses on the word tremare -LRB- to tremble -RRB- . ''

		In his serious moods the Pope was no less individual .

		De Cesare describes the intense interest he took in the direction of the discussions on the doctrine of papal infallibility .

		After the results of the war of
1859	DATE	have been explained , the interest of the volume centres about the attempts to settle the Roman question , of which the most startling were the schemes of Cavour and
Ricasoli	PERSON	.

		These were the first steps toward the Law of Guarantees .

		The fate of Father
Passaglia	PERSON	, who was one of the negotiators , recalls the recent painful experiences , in another field of reconciliation , of the Modernists .

		De Cesare brings out clearly the weak and hesitant policy of the Italian ministry on the eve of
Mentana	LOCATION	.

		He notes , apropos of the battle , that although the French chassepots may have done '' wonders , '' the '' Stutzen carbines of the Pontificals were more murderous . ''

		In reference to the book as a whole it may be added that those who know the
Rome	LOCATION	of the present day will find many interesting pages on the topography and social organization of the city of a generation or two ago . ''

		It is a recognized fact that the work tSSSSSlL * the world is largely done by neu - rasthenes . ''

		Whether this sentiment is likely to receive wide endorsement or not , the story reported by Dr.
Margaret A. Cleaves	PERSON	in '' The Auto - biography of a Neurasthene '' -LRB-
Richard Badger	PERSON	-RRB- tells a remarkable tale of success in the active practice of medicine on the part of one who , by reason of weak inheritance , dwelt for years in the dismal shadow of neurasthenia .

		The incapacitating effect of this most serious handicap to success seems in this case to have been met by an indomitable will ; and it is an open question how far the advice , '' Go thou and do like - wise , '' may really be offered to those of like condition .

		It seems to make surprising differences in the inter - ference with normal life which this dread disorder induces , whether it attacks one group of activities or emotions , or another .

		But there can be no doubt that the most courageous persons are the neurasthenics , who accomplish all their ordinary tasks in spite of the terrific , if irrational , fear which obsesses them .

		It is indeed a notable document that is recorded in this unusual autobiography .

		Here and there are inconsistencies , both of statement , of attitude , and of grammar ; but on the whole the account rings true , even though disguised in the interests of anonymity .

		Its reading may be recommended as a consolation to nervous invalids , and as a warning to those who by temperament are likely to become so .

		A book for ^ n tne P re f ace * ° his work on '' Sailing the lover of Ships '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
E. Keble	PERSON	sailing craft .

		Chatterton states that his history has been written `` primarily for the general reader . ''

		Yet the sort of general reader he has in mind surely has sea-legs under him and a weather-eye suffi - ciently peeled to distinguish a '' butter-rigged '' top - sail schooner in the offing from one whose to ` gallant sail is not set flying , or a genuine barque from the '' jackass '' variety .

		To understand Mr.
Chatterton	PERSON	's book , the reader must be a real sailor-man , who knows what brails and braces are , as well as the difference between a to ` gallant yard and a stun ` sail

		THE DIAL 57 boom , -- no mere fore-and-aft fresh-water man , but a genuine sea-dog such as has become a rarity even in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fancy the sympathy and horror of a land-lubber upon reading that '' running with her bonnet off , she gripes badly . ''

		He might fancy that Mr.
Chatterton	PERSON	referred to some poor old lady with the colly-wobbles , instead of a
Norfolk	LOCATION	wherry labor - ing with shortened sail in a gale of wind .

		Decidedly , then , Mr.
Chatterton	PERSON	's volume is not for the '' gen - eral reader , '' but for him who loves salt water -- for the sport-loving sailor , in fact , who believes that the sailing ship bears the same superiority over the mere steamer that the horse does over the automobile .

		To such a reader it will be heartily welcome , for it traces succinctly -- and clearly , if one understands sailor 's talk -- the history of the sailing ship from the first Egyptian craft of which we have knowledge down to the time when a
Gloucester	LOCATION	boat left the ways so gracefully that a bystander , exclaiming '' See how she scoons ! ''

		added the word '' schooner '' to the language ; aye , even to the day of the racing machines that defend the
America	LOCATION	's cup .

		It is just the sort of book to have for handy reference on board the yacht when one sits on deck in the gloam - ing of the second dog-watch smoking a pipe and arguing with a nautical friend .

		It is a book , too , for the marine artist , its one hundred and thirty illustrations being technically correct ; in a word , a ready means to prevent the sad mistakes that mar the average marine-drawing for the sailor-man 's eye .

		Though not a work for the land-lubber , it should find a place on the book-shelf of every true lover of sail - ing craft .

		- What must strike one in reading Mr. Literature and 6 .

		advertising in
Lawrence Lewis	PERSON	s '' The Advertise - '' The Spectator - . ''

		men tsof The Spectator '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the comparatively slight difference between the advertisements of the present day and those of the days of
Steele	PERSON	.

		We , of course , advertise more ex - tensively and much more aggressively ; we go out into the highways and hedges and compel the buyer to come into our shops .

		But the advertisers in '' The Spectator '' were none the less assured of the supe - riority of their goods to all others , as witness : '' The most acute and violent Tooth-ache instantly cured , by a liquid remedy prepared without Mercury . ''

		The accompanying pictures of the dismal persons cured were reserved for our long-suffering age .

		Fraudulent schemes now exploited in the
Sunday	DATE	issues of our papers of negligible morals were given the dignity of insertion in the highly moral ' • Spec - tator . ''

		Addison and
Steele	PERSON	condemned in their arti - cles what as `` practical men '' they approved of in their advertising columns .

		When the '' ads '' fell off as a consequence of the tax , the paper ultimately died from non-support .

		That even the '' agony column '' is not a modern invention for the relief of distressed lovers , the following bears witness : ``
Florinda	PERSON	, the letter , you was desirous to know , was received . ''

		The news '' ad '' too was not un - known .

		Thus it seems likely that
Addison	PERSON	's seven - teen critiques on '' Paradise Lost '' were written '' with the ulterior motive of promoting the sale of
Tonson	ORGANIZATION	's edition of
Milton	LOCATION	's epic . ''

		In like manner we find
Addison	PERSON	making all manner of fun of Italian opera till the management '' came down '' with some paying advertisements , when a most complimentary notice appeared .

		All this is strangely familiar , but we had believed better things of '' The Spectator . ''

		The book has an interesting selection of specimen advertisements , and through these it throws very valuable light on the times , as well as on some lit - erary questions that had not before been satisfac - torily answered .

Gordon	PERSON	The peaceful conquest of and the subsequent defeat and dis - the Soudan .

Africa	LOCATION	for tragic interest .

		To-day , amid the tropic heat and dust of
Khartoum	LOCATION	, another conquest is going steadily on , not by cannon and sword , but by the patient , unobserved , unap - plauded and largely unnoticed efforts of a group of investigators and physicians in the scientific depart - ments of
Gordon Memorial College of Khartoum	ORGANIZATION	.

		The third '' Annual Report '' of the Wellcome Re - search laboratories of this institution gives a glimpse of the lines of investigation , fraught with unknown and perhaps untold consequences to the future of this land and the teeming population of the
Upper Nile	ORGANIZATION	regions ; for they are all designed to increase man 's knowledge and mastery of that tropical envi - ronment .

		The Report contains investigations on the diseases of men and of animals due to parasites , including observations on the protozoan , the cause of the much dreaded '' sleeping sickness '' of man and of allied diseases in lower animals ; on poisonous serpents ; on the native medical customs and super - stitions , and the healing art as practised by the dervishes ; on the insects injurious to fruits , crops , and goods , in storage or transit ; and anthropological investigations on the native and sometimes still - savage tribes .

		No outpost of modern civilization contends with forces of nature and savagery so malign in character , so entrenched by the process of evolution , by custom and by inheritance , as this English colony at
Khartoum	LOCATION	.

		The Report , quite aside from its scientific value , is an interesting human document , recording the first steps in this second , and , let us hope , permanent and peaceful conquest of the Soudan for modern civilization .

		Stage settings Much has recency been done toward in the time of the determination of the stage condi -
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		ditions under which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays were presented to their first audiences , as well in special monographs like
Brodmeier	PERSON	's and
Reynolds	PERSON	's as in the more general works of
Schelling	PERSON	and
Baker	PERSON	.

		It is well to know that the Shakespearian stage is not a mere matter of curtains , which itinerant dramatic companies can foist upon the public at a convenient cost to themselves .

		The latest treatise 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	y upon this subject is Dr.
Victor E. Albright	PERSON	's `` The Elizabethan Stage '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which appears with the imprimatur of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		A study is made of the rude staging of the old miracle plays , the interludes , and the moralities , so as to trace the development of the stage to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	; and a corresponding study is made of the
Restora	PERSON	- tion stage so as to carry back what is evidently a survival from the time of Shakespeare .

		In this way a determination of the actual stage of Shake - speare 's time is made from both ends .

		The con - clusion arrived at is that '' the typical Shakespearian stage contained the following parts : an outer and an inner stage separated by a curtain , two proscen - ium doors , a gallery closed by a curtain , two balcony windows , and a ' hut . ' ''

		There was , of course , no curtain of any kind in front , nor was the curtain at the back painted ; consequently there was no '' per - spective in scenes '' such as came in with D'Avenant at the Restoration .

		The stage was therefore not a part of indefinite space , as with us , but a mere room or enclosure .

		There were very few properties , only enough to indicate the character of the scene .

		Everything was arranged for the presentation of the play with as little loss of time as possible .

		The audience was of imagination all compact , and did not need the elaborate background of a modern theatri - cal production .

		A sound mind An extremely interesting group of with the aid of essays by ten distinguished physi - cs sound body .

		c i ans ig published under the just now popular title of '' Psychotherapeutics '' -LRB-
Richard Badger	PERSON	-RRB- .

		They form the addresses given at
New Haven	LOCATION	, in
May of this year	DATE	, at a meeting of the
American Therapeutic Society	ORGANIZATION	, devoted wholly to this topic .

		These essays will appeal to the physi - cian who has no special acquaintance with nervous disorders , and equally to the layman who has .

		They cover a variety of aspects of this question , such as the value of hypnotic suggestion , the treatment of fatigue states by mental means , the methods of analysis -LRB- which amount to a special psychological technique -RRB- , the application of similar measures to prevent disaster in childhood , the relation of char - acter to psychotherapy , and the several medical and psychological purposes underlying this form of pro- ducing a sound mind with the aid of a sound body .

		The general impression of this symposium is at once to enforce a caution against the shallow or hasty use of psychotherapeutics , and equally a very encour - aging endorsement of its value when applied with the expertness and technique indispensable to every art .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	publishes an '' Oxford edition '' of the '' Poems of
Robert Southey	PERSON	'' in two forms , one being somewhat higher-priced than the other .

		Mr.
Maurice H. Fitzgerald	PERSON	has edited this work , which will be very welcome as a compact representation of a poet who gets something less of attention from modern readers than is his dae .

		It includes the four epics , '' Thalaba , '' '' The Curse of Kehama , '' ''
Roderick	PERSON	, '' and ''
Madoc	PERSON	, '' besides a large selection from the rest of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's poetical writings .

		We may say quantum satis , on the whole , despite our usual objection to editions that are less than complete .

		Miss
Mary B. Ehrmann	PERSON	is the composer of two col - lections of songs for young people , '' The Child 's Song Treasury '' and '' The Child 's Song Garden , '' both pub - lished by
Messrs. H. W. Willis & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her selection of texts for musical setting is excellent , nearly all of the poems having some value as literature , and particularly as literature within the reach of a child 's appreciation .

		Both melodies and accompaniments are simple and graceful .

		M The Englishman in
Italy	LOCATION	'' is a very charming little book published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		It is edited by Mr.
George Hyde Wollaston	PERSON	, and quite adequately de - scribed upon its title-page as '' a collection of verses written by some of those who have loved
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Most of the familiar pieces are here , and some less familiar , but richly deserving of acquaintance , drawn from the writings of such men as
Symonds	LOCATION	,
Dobell	PERSON	, Trench , Mil - man , and
Hare	LOCATION	.

		There is a good equipment of notes and indexes .

		The first thing to be noted about ''
Terry	PERSON	's
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' a guide-book to our sister republic by Mr.
T. Philip Terry	PERSON	, is the marvellous exactitude with which it imi - tates the familiar Baedeker manuals .

		In every mechani - cal respect , binding , typography , and engraving of maps and plans , it looks as if it might have come straight from the
Leipzig	LOCATION	establishment .

		But as a matter of fact , it is a product of the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, and , although it is ostensibly published in the
City of Mexico	LOCATION	, the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	are its agents in this country .

		The text also , in arrangement and selection of material , follows the
Baedeker	PERSON	example -LRB- and there is no better -RRB- so closely that nothing is left to be desired .

		It is a book that is calculated to fill anyone possessed of the traveller 's instinct with a wild desire to pack up and set off at once in search of the multitudinously interesting places and objects described in its pages and to be traced in its alluring maps .

		Nothing in book form could well be more appealing to genuine book-lovers than the reprints that come to us from the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Henry Frowde -RRB- .

		Just now we have a group of volumes of exceptional interest .

		The stately edition of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
J. C. Smith	PERSON	, is completed by publication of '' The Faerie Queene , '' in two volumes .

		Mr.
S. P. Vivian	PERSON	has edited , for publica - tion in similar form , the volume of ''
Campion	PERSON	's Works , '' which includes the Latin poems and prose treatises along with the lovely lyrics .

		In smaller but quite charming form , we have the '' Select Poems of
Winthrop Mack	PERSON	- worth Praed , '' edited by Mr.
A. D. Godley	PERSON	; `` Shelley 's Literary and Philosophical Criticism , '' edited by Mr.
John Shaweroes	PERSON	;
Lowell	PERSON	's `` Fireside Travels , '' edited by Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	; '' A Hundred Verses from
Old Japan	LOCATION	, '' being a translation by Mr.
William N. Porter	PERSON	of the '' Hyaka-nin-isshiu '' -LRB- with the original text and native illustrations -RRB- ; Sir
William Temple	PERSON	's '' Essays on Ancient and Modern Learning and on Poetry , '' edited by Professor
J. E. Spingarn	PERSON	; the poems of
Keats	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
M. Robertson	PERSON	from the edition of
1820	DATE	; and -LRB- in the '' Tudor and Stuart Library '' -RRB-
Browne	PERSON	's '' Religio Medici '' with
Kenelm Henry Uigby	ORGANIZATION	's '' Observations '' upon it .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 59 Notes .

		It is announced that Mrs.
Josephine Daskam Bacon	PERSON	is the author of ''
Margarita	PERSON	's Soul , '' a popular novel published anonymously two or three months ago .

		The monumental work on '' Social England , '' edited by the late
H. D. Traill	PERSON	and Dr.
J. S. Mann	PERSON	, is to be reissued soon by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	in an enlarged and revised edition , to occupy twelve volumes .

		.

		The
Teachers ' College of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	send us a brief monograph on '' Later Roman Education in
Ausonius	LOCATION	,
Capella	LOCATION	, and the Theodosian Code , '' pre - pared , with translations and commentary , by Dr. Per - cival
R. Cole	PERSON	. ''

		The Centenary of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' a lecture given in the Sheldoniau Theatre by the Vice-Chancellor of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, is
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	's contribution to the recent com - memoration of the great poet .

		It is published in pam - phlet form by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		The
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, publish a volume of '' Selected Articles on the
Commission Plan of Munici	ORGANIZATION	- pal
Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' compiled by Mr.
E. Clyde Robbins	PERSON	, and forming an issue in the '' Debaters ' Handbook Series '' for the use of college debating teams . ''

		The
Elements of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	, '' a treatise by Pro- fessor
G. F. Warren	PERSON	, is a text-book for high schools and colleges , published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In its fitness for use in the high schools it has no competitor among modern texts , and in that respect supplies a long-felt want .

		The
Nobel Prize in Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	for
1909	DATE	has been awarded to Professor
Wilhelm Ostwald	PERSON	of
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	's works have included a number of text-books , the most recent of which is '' An Elementary Text-Book in Modern Chemistry '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In a new series of handbooks called '' A History of the Sciences , '' the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	publish the '' History of Chemistry , '' in two volumes , by Sir
Edward Thorpe	PERSON	, and the '' History of Astronomy , '' by Professor
George Forbes	PERSON	.

		These little books are interestingly written and illustrated .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will inaugurate their books of
1910	DATE	for general readers with two related to the drama , -- '' Elizabethan People '' by Professor
Heury Thew Stephenson	PERSON	of
Indiana University	ORGANIZATION	, and M
Allison	PERSON	's Lad and Other Martial Interludes '' by Miss
Beulah Marie Dix	PERSON	, both of which they hope to issue early in
February	DATE	.

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a '' Text-Book of Hydraulics , '' by Professor
George E. Russell	PERSON	.

		It is a work for classroom use in the more advanced schools of technology .

		From the same publishers we have a '' History of the Human Body , '' an advanced text-book of human anatomy and physiology by Professor
Harris Hawthorne Wilder	PERSON	.

		It was not so many years ago that Mendele'eff 's law was dismissed with a scant page or so in the average text-book of chemistry .

		It has since gained recogni - tion as the fundamental principle of the science , a fact now attested by the appearance of '' The Periodic Law , '' by Mr.
A. E. Garrett	PERSON	, as a volume of the '' International Scientific Series , '' published by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Schwenkfelder revival is in full swing in
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania .

		We mentioned some months ago the inaugura - tion of the huge publishing enterprise of the ''
Corpus Schwenckfeldianorum	PERSON	, '' and now we have as a contribu - tion to the '' Americana Germanica '' series a monograph on ''
Schwenkfelder Hymnology	PERSON	and the Sources of the
First Schwenkfelder Hymn-Book Printed	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Allen Anders Seipt	PERSON	The book has several in - teresting illustrations in the form of photographs and facsimiles .

		It is a matter of pleasing interest to
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	, and perhaps to its readers , to note the number of contribu - tors to its pages who have become presidents of various learned societies that have lately held their annual gatherings .

		Among them are Dr.
D. S. Jordan	PERSON	,
Presi	PERSON	- dent of the
American Association	ORGANIZATION	for the
Advancement of Science	ORGANIZATION	; Prof.
F. J. Turner	PERSON	, President of the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	; Prof.
Paul Shorey	PERSON	, President of the
American Philological Association	ORGANIZATION	; Prof.
F. W. Kelsey	PERSON	, President of the American Archae - ological Institute ; Mr.
Irving K. Pond	PERSON	, President of the
Institute of American Architects	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the list is by no means complete .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's great work on '' The American Common - wealth , '' published over twenty years ago , is regarded by its distinguished author as out of date .

		After running through numerous more or less revised editions , the work now undergoes a thorough overhauling at Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's hands , and so radical are the changes and additions sug - gested to him by his later familiarity with the American people and American institutions , that entirely new plates will be called for in the proposed new issue of the book .

		The last two decades have been fruitful in events and de - velopments of national significance , and Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's com - mentary on them will be well worth reading .

		Already the curious fact has been noted that the best exposition of our system of government is from an Englishman 's pen , while the ablest treatise on the English Constitu - tion is the work of an American , our new President of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fiftieth anniversary of the '' Cornhill Magazine '' is celebrated this month by the issue of a '' Jubilee Xumber , '' to which Lady
Ritchie	PERSON	, Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, Dr.
W. H. Fitchett	PERSON	and others contribute special articles .

		It is cause for congratulation that while so many high - class English monthlies , like ''
Macmillan	PERSON	's Magazine , '' ''
Murray	PERSON	's Magazine , '' ''
Longman	PERSON	's Magazine , '' and '' Temple Bar , '' have been pushed to the wall , this excel - lent literary periodical has rounded out its half-century of honorable existence .

		Edited first by
Thackeray	PERSON	, and later by
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and by
James Payn	PERSON	, it has always maintained a high standard , and has given to the world , in serial form , the works of many of the great novelists of its time -- even as it is now producing the latest of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's stories .

		With the old and reliable ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's , '' it stands in eloquent pro- test against the deluge of sixpenny popular monthlies now flooding the hind .

		The Trustees of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	announce that they have arranged to publish through the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	a complete edition of the works of
John Milton	PERSON	, in verse and in prose , in English and in
Latin	LOCATION	.

		The editorial supervision of the work has been accepted by
William P. Trent	PERSON	, LL.D. , Professor of English Literature in
Barnard College	LOCATION	,
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity .

		Professor
Trent	PERSON	has already published a study of
Milton	LOCATION	, and is now completing a biography and bibli - ography of
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	, which is to be issued shortly in three volumes by the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		For his difficult task Professor
Trent	PERSON	is qualified by life - 60 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Such terrors Dr.
E. H. Rowland	PERSON	in her little book , ' The Right to Believe , ' has done much to remove .

		Her elaborate scientific and philosophic training , her brilliant style , candor , and devoutness , should make her a veritable friend of the spirit wherever there are perplexed souls .

		It would not be easy to point to another religious book where so much good sense is packed into so brief a compass . ''

		A knowledge of the laws of mutation must sooner or later lead to the possibility of inducing mutations at will and so of originating perfectly new characters in animals and plants .

		And just as the process of selection has enabled us to produce improved races , greater in value and in beauty , so a control of the mutative process will , it is hoped , place in our hands the power of originating permanently improved species of animals and plants .

		The whole science of vital phenomena is contained in what

		It treats of the epoch of the Reformation , but does not attempt to deal with the religious conflict except in so far as it influenced the political , diplomatic , and economic activities of the period .

		Our whole interpretation of the sixteenth century , of course , has been profoundly changed by the recent progress in economics : and in the matter of industrial history , and of the retroactive effect of wretched existing conditions , as also in the development of the

		It is a matter of common knowledge to all who are familiar with the Armenian struggle for religious freedom , that political forces have been a strong factor in the persecution to which this people has been periodically subjected .

		All the sidelights which the condition of European politics could throw on the situation have been employed by the author , and his sympathetic treatment leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the various motives for the frequent outbreaks against the Armenians which have aroused the Christian world .

United States	LOCATION	have grown up , for the most part , in the
Eastern States	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	has long been recognized as the chief distributing centre for American books .

		The
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, from the Alleghanies to the Rockies , is the great book-buying section of the country , and the city which focuses the principal lines of transporta - tion of this section is naturally the city to which it looks for supplies not of meat and grain alone .

		It is only a logical extension of this principle that has recently brought to
Chicago	LOCATION	the headquarters of the American Library Asso - ciation , which is now comfortably housed in quarters generously provided by the
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	of the municipality .

		Chicago thus be - comes the centre of the activities represented by the profession of American librarianship ; and those activities , we need hardly say , are varied and far-reaching to an extent of which the gen - eral public has little idea The fact that
Chicago	LOCATION	is the home of four of the largest libraries in the country constitutes one of the important reasons for thus making it the national centre and rallying-point of the pro- fession .

		These libraries , all four of which have been rapidly growing in possessions and in use - fulness , are the
John Crerar	PERSON	Library , the New - berry Library , the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and
the University of Chicago Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first two have about a quarter of a million volumes each , the third upwards of a third of a million , and the fourth a number not far below half a million .

		Here , then , are about a million and a third of volumes altogether , dedicated to the uses of the democracy and the republic of scholarship .

		There have recently been develop - ments in the history of all four of these libraries which , while sufficiently familiar to Chicagoans , are of such interest to the larger public as to call for the brief statement that we are now about to make .

		The library of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, the largest of the four , is to be congratulated upon the pros - pective erection of a long-needed building .

		Soon after the death of President
Harper	PERSON	, plans were made for a library building that should bear his name , and that should stand as the 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, imposing central structure of the campus group .

		A popular subscription was opened , in order that the building might be the result of many personal contributions , and Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	made the liberal offer of three additional dol - lars for every one thus subscribed .

		The sum of eight hundred thousand dollars was fixed as the total to be realized , and that mark was reached some months ago .

		An adequate building is thus assured , and it will be erected as soon as possible .

		The
University Library	ORGANIZATION	has thus far been without an official head , and its collections have grown in a rather haphazard way .

		The departments have done about as they pleased with their special appropriations , and there has been little coordination of effort .

		In fact , the most difficult problem that will confront the librarian , when he shall have been appointed , will be that of reconciling the departmental demands with the general interests of the insti - tution .

		He will have to be both diplomatic and masterful to bring order out of the long - existing chaos .

		This problem confronts the administration of every large university library , but we imagine that it will prove unusually serious in the present instance .

		The
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has been in the lime-light of local interest since the disturbance of
last spring	DATE	, marked by the abrupt dismissal of its faithful and efficient librarian , and all the miserable chicanery which attended that indefensible act .

		The fact that a highly capa - ble successor , in the person of Mr.
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	, has been provided , places that deplor - able affair in the class of res judicatce , but by no means wipes away the reproach .

		The activ - ities of the new librarian are taking the form of a reorganization of the service upon a more professional basis than formerly obtained , a movement to establish branch libraries in out - lying sections of the city , and an extension of circulation through the agency of the public schools .

		The last of these activities is particu - larly important , and is capable of surprising results .

		The latest report upon this subject from
New York	LOCATION	exhibits nearly half a million volumes in class-room libraries and a home cir - culation for the year of six millions .

		It costs a great deal of money to carry out such plans , as well as to establish branch libraries ; and
Chicago	LOCATION	has not yet got the money in sight .

		As a matter of fact , these good things would have been done years ago had the money been available , and had the library trustees made them the object of serious effort .

		The
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, under the direction of Mr.
W.N. C. Carleton	PERSON	, the recently-appointed head , is entering upon a promising period of development .

		This is the institution which of all the Big Four most distinctly stands for the humanities , and is therefore peculiarly inter - esting to the friends of liberal culture .

		It was unfortunately handicapped many years ago by an over-expensive building , the construction of which impaired very seriously the endowment , and the upkeep of which has kept the annual appropriation for books far below what it might have beeen under a more sagacious management .

		It has been still further handicapped by a pre - posterous cataloguing device and by a clas - sification which unduly sacrificed practical to theoretical considerations .

		Mr.
Carlton	PERSON	has no slight task before him in bringing order out of this comparative chaos , and his energies will have to expend themselves upon these matters alone for a long time to come .

		The
John Crerar Library	PERSON	, restricted to the sciences -- although this term is taken in a very catholic sense -- has been exceptionally well managed from the beginning , both in a business and a professional way .

		It has had but one librarian , Mr.
Clement W. Andrews	PERSON	, who has built up both the collections and the adminis - trative organization to admirable effect .

		The trustees , moreover , did not make the initial mis - take of putting a large part of the endowment fund into a costly plant , but determined instead to occupy rented quarters until a building fund should have been created out of the accumula - tions of surplus income .

		The wisdom of this policy is now patent , for the fund is ready to be used , the interest-bearing capital has not been reduced , and the collection of books is even larger than could have been expected from so severely economical a plan .

		The problem now before this institution is that of securing a site .

		The municipality has offered public land in the heart of the city , fronting on
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	, and the library has accepted the offer .

		Unfor - tunately , there is in
Chicago	LOCATION	one obstructionist individual who claims a legal right to keep the lake front clear of buildings , and he has thus far been successful in thwarting the evident wishes of the community .

		The litigation is slowly drawing toward its end , and with that end the chief problem of the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	will be settled one way or another .

		Taking a concluding general glance at the four great libraries of
Chicago	LOCATION	, we see that they have had many difficulties to overcome , and that they have sometimes suffered from acts of mis - taken judgment .

		Looking at them merely as
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 collections of books , the one outstanding fact about them is that , with a single exception , they are the result of accretion rather than of organic growth .

		What they now need is a closer delimitation of their spheres of activity , a systematic filling-up of their gaps , and an extension of the principle of cooperation in serving the community toward which they have a common obligation .

		They are now under such direction that we may anticipate for them henceforth just the sort of organic development that has hitherto been but imperfectly realized .

		GLEANINGS FROM THE LIBRARY PRESS OF
1909	DATE	.

		The library profession has during the past year made its contribution to the gayety of the nations .

		An editorial contributor in the
London	LOCATION	'' Library World '' wrote two articles comparing American and European -LRB- especially English -RRB- libraries , poking fun at what he called `` American tomfoolery , '' -- the efforts to attract children through picture bulle - tins and Hallowe'en parties , which he compared with `` the freaky sideshows which are to be found in the cabarets at
Montmartre	LOCATION	. ''

		He also tried his hand at the dismal science of library statistics , the study of which led him to the belief that American libraries are shining examples of '' extravagant management and comparatively poor results , '' a belief which evidently comforted his heart , as it was intended by the author `` to bring comfort to the heart of the British rate-payer by showing that , in comparison with his American fellow-victim , he is getting a valuable public service for a mere trifle , '' that is , in plain language , that British libraries have inadequate funds , and that British librarians are woefully underpaid -- as they certainly must be if their salaries are smaller than those prevailing in
America	LOCATION	.

		The English writer adds a personal touch when he says that he has found American librarians to be '' a somewhat narrow-minded , self-sufficient and wilfully-ignorant class of public officials , '' with emoluments large enough to enable them to feast on '' pumpkin pie , clams , baked beans and canvas-back duck all the year round . ''

		These two articles , nat - urally , provoked several replies in American jour - nals , but of most of these it can be said that , if the Englishman used a club where the sword of a French duelist would have been more appropriate , the Americans largely missed the humor of the situation and made the mistake of taking a donkey for a bull .

		Criticism is good for the soul , but it must , to be effective , combine frankness with fairness and good nature .

		It was just here that the critic in the '' Library World '' failed .

		Of the replies which his article evoked , Dr.
E. C. Richardson	PERSON	's address on '' Book Matters at Home and Abroad , '' read at the bi-state meeting in
Atlantic City	LOCATION	in
March	DATE	, and printed in the
May	DATE	'' Library Journal , '' has its value , both in the even-tempered and dignified refutation of some of the statistical vagaries of our English critic , and in the author 's own passing judgment on where American librarians lead , where European .

		The progress of cooperative cataloguing , the development of library schools , '' the intelligent application of libraries to social life , '' are pointed out as among the distinctive American contribu - tions to library progress ; while the leadership of
Europe	LOCATION	is acknowledged in inter-library loans and '' in almost all the higher branches of library sci - ence : Bibliography ,
Palaeography	LOCATION	, all the historical aspects , the choice and use of books for scholarly use , the Seminar method , etc. .

		We have also , '' Dr.
Richardson	PERSON	adds , `` been glad to find European libraries pressing hard by in the development of the stack system , showing us ingenious practical devices and teaching us all sorts of excellent points in technique . ''

		The widespread interest in historical matters among English librarians is testified to by several articles in the English library press .

		Mr.
W. R. B. Prideaux	PERSON	has an interesting paper in the
April	DATE	'' Library Association Record '' on '' Library Econ - omy in the
Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' his material being drawn chiefly from
Conrad Gesner	PERSON	's '' Pandecta '' -LRB- 1548 -RRB- ,
Florianus Treflerus	PERSON	' `` Methodus '' -LRB- 1560 -RRB- , and
Angelo Roccha	PERSON	's ''
Bibliotheca Apostolica Vati	PERSON	- cana '' -LRB- 159 1 -RRB- .

		The author shows how books then were accessioned , catalogued , classified , shelf-listed , much as they are now , and says truly : '' It ought to be a very real help in our present problems if we are able occasionally to place ourselves in the position of our predecessors and enter into their difficulties .

		We can trace what means they adopted to cope with them and what success attended their efforts , and before long we will find that their difficulties were not so very different from our own .

		I contend that his - torical study is one of the most practical forms of study and one of the richest in results . ''

		The
Milton	PERSON	centenary gave Mr.
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	the text for the introductory article in the
January	DATE	issue of `` The Library , '' -- `` The Bibliography of
John Milton	PERSON	. ''

		This article is a model of bibliographical biography , in which the very title-pages , as it were , are put in their proper place in the story of the au - thor 's life .

		Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	has also contributed , during the past two years , several articles , of interest to bibliog - rapher and bookman , to '' The Printing Art . ''

		In one of these papers , on `` The Ending of Books , '' he makes a plea for a return to the habit of the early printers to reserve a rather conspicuous place at the end of a book for their name and place of printing . ''

		A printer , '' Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	says , '' has right to an ade - quate recognition of the good work which he puts into a book , and this recognition naturally takes a form which gives a decorative finish to the end of 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, a volume , instead of allowing it , as is the case with so many modern books , to stumble along at hap - hazard to an humble conclusion . ''

		In three articles in the
April , June	DATE	, and
October	DATE	numbers of '' The Library , '' entitled `` The So-called Gutenberg Documents , '' Mr.
J. H. Hessels	PERSON	retraces the paths of his earlier writing , adding little or nothing that is new .

		His new investigations leave the question of the invention of printing exactly where it was before .

		It is reasonably well proved , though Mr.
Hessels	PERSON	does not admit it , that in the year
1439	DATE	Gutenberg was engaged , among other undertakings in metal work , on something that looks suspiciously like printing ; we have document - ary evidence that he was engaged in printing a very large book for some years between
1450	DATE	and
1455	DATE	-LRB- or 1453 -RRB- , and we have typological evidence that before
1450	DATE	-- how long we do not know -- some - one in
Mainz	LOCATION	-LRB- and there was no other printer in
Mainz	LOCATION	at that time than Gutenberg -RRB- had been printing a number of broadsides and pamphlets .

		Of print - ing with movable type as practiced by
Gutenberg	ORGANIZATION	, `` Dutch Donatuses , '' accordingto the
Cologne Chroni	PERSON	- cle of
1499	DATE	, were a '' prefiguration , '' whatever that may mean .

		Of
Gutenberg	ORGANIZATION	we know enough to satisfy us beyond doubt , that he lived and practiced print - ing in
Mainz	LOCATION	about the middle of the fifteenth cen - tury .

		About
Coster	PERSON	, or whoever else printed the '' Dutch Donatuses , '' we know nothing , not even when he lived , or when the books ascribed to him were printed .

		But to enter fully into this contro - versy would carry us too far .

		Mr.
Louis N. Wilson	PERSON	, the librarian of
Clark Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , published in the
May	DATE	number of `` Public Libraries , '' under the title '' Common Sense in Li - braries , '' the result of an enqiiete among two thou - sand university men , journalists , school teachers , and other users of libraries in various parts of the country , by which he tried to find out what those who use libraries think of them , and what improvements have suggested themselves to library users .

		Not less than
1743	DATE	answers were returned , a remarkable evidence of the interest with which libraries are regarded among those for whom they exist .

		The criticisms centred round four points : Too much art at the cost of adaptability in the buildings , too little light and ventilation in the public rooms , too many restrictions , and too much patronizing .

		The restric - tions against admission to the shelves are those that are most often and most earnestly complained of .

		And the two-card system , by which only one work of fiction may be taken out at a time , is also dis - paraged , and seems to be looked upon as an item of patronizing , though there are sufficient adminis - trative reasons to justify that rule .

		The fiction problem itself is taken by the horns by one of Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	's correspondents in the following fashion : `` If people want novels , let them have them -- the good ones -- and do not worry about it .

		Is there any earthly objection to the reading of standard novels ?

		As to the unwholesome ones , do not buy them . '' ''

		The Librarian 's Future '' is discussed by Mr.
C. K. Bolton	PERSON	in the
January	DATE	'' Library Journal . ''

		He compares the profession of librarianship with those of the law and medicine , and finds that , in matters of a broad outlook upon life , a wide-awake interest in the world that surrounds them , librarians lag behind .

		But there is comfort in sight : '' Leaders in all work are men who do more than earn a liveli - hood .

		Are we , '' Mr.
Bolton	PERSON	asks , '' to reach this standard ?

		If so , two courses seem just now open to us , the old way of scholarship , the new way of sociological interest .

		The old way has a few adher - ents among our American librarians .

		The new way -- the civic spirit -- claims a greater number of earnest followers . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A POISON-LABEL FOR TREACHEROUS LITERATURE , proposed by Librarian
Lummis	PERSON	of the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and already commented on by us , has now been before the library world -LRB- as a sugges - tion , that is -RRB- for some months .

		In his current Annual Report , Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	devotes ten pages to this question of warning the reader not to repose con - fidence in untrustworthy books , giving a summary of answers received from other librarians to a question - naire extensively circulated by him .

		As an illus - tration of Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's striking and original way of putting things , let us quote his remarks on the value of critical comments printed in a catalogue rather than conspicuously displayed on the books themselves . ''

		But the vital thing is , '' he says , '' that these druggists do not put their poison label in the right place .

		It is like placing it , not on the bottle , but in the druggist 's prescription-book at the drug - store .

		There are , doubtless , Methodic Citizens , who , if seized with an internal disturbance at 2 o'clock , a. m. , would prefer to run down town to the drug - store and waken the druggist to consult his book as to whether the bottle labelled < R. 932 : 361 ' is paregoric , glycerine , Mother
Winslow	PERSON	's ,
Lydia Pink	PERSON	- ham , carbolic acid , strychnine , or what .

		The average mere human prefers the skull-and-crossbones on the bottle itself , along with the name of the dose . ''

		The one objection to this labelling scheme , as brought out by the canvass of librarians , is its insufficient practi - cability , especially for libraries of less than the am - plest resources .

		Few libraries can maintain a corps of experts , in all departments of literature , to see that each book , as it is placed on the shelf , is labelled with nice regard to its excellences and defects .

		But Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	is pushing ahead , and has obtained his directors ' approval of five simple forms of label for the guidance of his readers .

		His purpose he declares to be '' not censorship , nor any other partisan proced - ure , but rather a sort of ' Glorified Cross-Reference , ' to be employed with the same tact which is necessary in all other functions of a public library . ''

		Within
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 ten years , he predicts , this suggestion of his will he bearing fruit in every respectable library in
America	LOCATION	.

		Let it be understood , finally , that the plan seems not to include fiction . ''

		Bad novels do no great harm -- particularly if you do n't have them .

		The people who abuse their mind with trash are predes - tined , anyhow . ''

		... Reminiscences evoked by the
Lew Wallace	PERSON	memorial , the statue of the late
General	ORGANIZATION	placed a few weeks ago in
Statuary Hall	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	by
the State of Indiana	ORGANIZATION	, are now current , and form a valuable appendix to the Autobiography which the author of '' Ben-Hur '' gave to the world about three years ago .

		From a letter written by him at
Constantinople	LOCATION	in
1885	DATE	the following passage is of interest : '' We may as well regard the curtain rung down on this act of life .

		I have tried many things in the course of the drama -- the law , soldiering , politics , authorship , and , lastly , diplomacy -- and if I may pass judgment on the success achieved in each , it seems now that when I sit down finally in the old man 's gown and slippers , helping the cat to keep the fireplace warm , I shall look back upon ' Ben-Hur ' as my best performance , and this mission near the Sultan as the next best . ''

		Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	's eloquent tribute to his friend contained many noteworthy passages ; for example : '' His gift of concentration was very unusual .

		He could write on his knee on a railway train , or in an office beset by callers , and never be disturbed .

		During the years between his return from
Turkey	LOCATION	and his death , I had many opportunities for observing him in various circumstances , and I never saw any lapse from that grave and beautiful courtesy which marked him . ''

		There was something oriental , probably in part ac - quired in the
East	LOCATION	, in his unruffled calm and perfect self-control .

		Concerning the genesis of '' Ben-Hur , '' Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	says it was a chance conversation with Colonel Ingersoll on a railway train that sent
Wallace	PERSON	home to pursue those studies which finally bore fruit in the romance whose success , after two years of only moderate sales , became enormous .

		No other novel , protected by copyright , has equalled the commercial success of u Ben-Hur . ''

		The indignity of the imperfect period is one to be protested against by all readers , and especially by those who pursue the pleasant practice of reading aloud and rather pride themselves on their skill in that now decadent ai ` t. Eccentric punctuation is one of the cheap devices easily within the reach of the striver after novelty , and not a few there are in the world of letters who avail themselves of it .

		Even so gifted a writer as Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	repeatedly grieves his admirers by erratic syntax and an improper use of the full stop .

		Opening ''
Alice	PERSON	- for-Short '' at random , one finds the fol - lowing : '' In days when a
Gretna Green	ORGANIZATION	elopement from
London	LOCATION	meant four days ' posting , day and night , through pastoral silences that are now resonant with pumping-engines ; under skies then clear that now are tainted with a Cimmerian gloom , or blacked outright like Hell -- through villages that have be - come railway-stations and village-inns that have become Hotels , with lifts . ''

		In the mould and form of a well-rounded period the author has palmed off on us a mere fragment of a period .

		Reading it aloud , one comes plump upon the full stop with somewhat the same kind of shock as is given to the unwary person descending a flight of stairs in the dark and reaching the bottom when he thinks there is still one stair left .

		Mrs. St.
Leger Harrison	PERSON	's '' Sir
Richard Calmady	PERSON	'' is another book that in - dulges in this sort of eccentricity .

		Her clauses calling only for commas between them are often sep - arated by periods , making them verbless sentences -- things abhorred by all right-minded persons .

		For reading aloud , such authors are a vexation and a torment .

		Let them go to school awhile to Macaulay and
Johnson	PERSON	and
Addison	PERSON	, and learn a proper respect for the laws and conventions govern - ing the construction of sentences .

		Some reminiscences of the first editor of '' Punch '' have recently been going the rounds of the press , in connection with the famous humorist 's centenary ; for
Mark Lemon	PERSON	followed the example of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, and other cele - brities , in choosing
1809	DATE	for his birth-year .

		It was Lemon 's rather peculiar and suggestive name that finally determined the choice of a title for the pro- jected paper . ''

		The Funny Dog '' had been all but decided upon , when one of the group of artists and authors interested in the new journal spoke of it as resembling a good brew of punch , in that it was nothing without a
Lemon	LOCATION	.

		Thereupon
Henry Mayhew	PERSON	, the proprietor of the paper , caught at the suggestion and exclaimed : '' A capital idea !

		We 'll call it ` Punch ' ! ''

		So humble were its first begin - nings that Lemon 's salary was no more than thirty shillings a week .

		Yet so truly did he discern the possibilities of the new weekly , and so effectively did he bend all his energies toward realizing those possibilities , that eventually he enjoyed an editorial income of fifteen hundred pounds a year .

		The story of
Lemon	LOCATION	's brilliant achievements and of the remarkable success he made of '' Punch '' -- a suc - cess that is wont to seem somewhat incredible to readers on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	-- is an interesting one .

		And all this carries one back sixty-nine years to the birth-year of u Punch '' in
1841	DATE	, while its genial and tactful first editor has been dead nearly forty years .

		A Sisyphus task for library trustees is that which has for seven weary years been unsuccess - fully attempted in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		The
District of Columbia Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is in urgent need of branches .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	has offered
$ 350,000	MONEY	, under the conditions usual in such cases , for the building of these branch libraries .

		For seven years attempts have been made to secure Congressional action favorable to the acceptance of at least enough 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, to erect a branch at
Tacoma Park	LOCATION	, where the resi - dents have offered to provide a suitable site ; but again and again the hope of success has been dis - appointed on the very eve of its expected realiza - tion , and the stone pushed almost to the top of the hill has gone rolling back again to the bottom .

		What interest has a
billion-dollar	MONEY
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in a petty thirty-thousand-dollar library bill ?

		There are no plums in that pudding for any constituency , no voters on the watch to punish a representative for lack of zeal .

		If one could any longer feel surprise at anything done or left undone by our national law-makers , it would be amazing to witness this indifferent attitude toward a most handsome offer to provide our capital city with needed library buildings ... The courteous and tactful librarian is he -LRB- or more often she -RRB- who can so sweetly and convin - cingly recommend a book possessed by the library , in place of one asked for but not at hand , that the applicant shall go away blessing the librarian for the happy substitution . ''

		For instance , '' says a facetious speaker at a recent meeting of
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts librarians , `` do n't say you have n't Mrs.
Mary J. Holmes	PERSON	's books , but rather say you have n't them to-day ; and add , ' But we have Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's books , and who would n't be interested in ``
Elsie Venner	PERSON	'' ? ' ''

		In similar manner , if Mill `` On Liberty '' is asked for at a small library not owning a copy , let the polite answer be : '' We regret that the book is not available just at present , but would n't ' Mill on the Floss ' serve your purpose equally well ? ''

		Or if `` Miss Toosey 's Mission '' is desired when the book happens to be out , rather than give a blunt refusal one might -LRB- though the age and calling of the applicant should first be considered -RRB- recommend
Bliss	PERSON	's `` Encyclopaedia of Missions . ''

		This plan of procedure , however , needs more careful elaboration than it can here receive .

		Public library events in
St. Louis	LOCATION	are just now unusually indicative of growth and progress .

		Mr.
Crunden	PERSON	's retirement because of illness last
summer	DATE	was cause for more than local regret .

		He had acted as librarian for nearly thirty - two years , and to him the present flourishing condition of the library is largely due .

		Under the new administra - tion -- that of Mr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	, who assumed charge last
October	DATE	-- the onward progress appears to continue unchecked .

		The latest official report of the library contains a view of the handsome new central building now under construction , with pic - tures of various branch buildings .

		A seventh branch is about to be built , if building has not already begun .

		Encouraging is the librarian 's report that though the branches multiply the circulation from the central building remains nearly constant , showing that each branch calls into being a fresh patronage -- the supply creates the demand , contrary to the usual rule in business .

		The '' Annual Report '' now before us is unusually full , covering in fact the
two years 1907-8	DATE	and
1908-9	DATE	, the issue for the earlier year having been omitted on account of Mr.
Crunden	PERSON	's illness .

		The winter encouragement of
summer	DATE	reading is systematically undertaken by the public library -LRB- or
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, as it is officially styled -RRB- of
Portland	LOCATION	,
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		In the months of short days and long evenings the seeds are sown that germinate and bear fruit in the
summer	DATE	season .

		The courses in English language and literature at the high schools of that city partly govern the libra - rian in issuing lists of selected books that may profit - ably be read in connection with the prescribed work ; and so ready has been the response on the part of students that the reading has in many instances been continued into the vacation .

		Five hundred and eighty-two vacation cards , the librarian informs us in her current Annual Report , were issued last year , and nearly forty-five hundred books were drawn for
summer	DATE	reading .

		A good record ; but one may , with - out offense , query how much the Oregonian
summer	DATE	, so different from the depressing season known in more eastern longitudes , has contributed to a result that would put to shame the record of many a com - munity possessing equally good schools and cherish - ing equally high standards of culture .

		The child 's conservative taste in litera - ture has often been noted .

		Whereas his elders are fretfully eager for the latest sensation in fiction , the tried and true old authors are good enough for him .

		Miss
Clara Herbert	PERSON	, of the children 's department of
the District of Columbia Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, reports for the past year a continued steady demand for the books of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	, and
Pyle	PERSON	.

		Furthermore , not only is it these standard novels that the young people demand for their light reading , but they show a disposition , in the com - munity named , to avail themselves increasingly of the library 's stores of more instructive literature .

		The demand for fiction declined in the last twelve months two per cent , despite the granting of unusual privileges in the drawing of books from that class .

		The ready response of children everywhere to intelli - gent and tactful encouragement in the choice of the best books is a source of satisfaction to the library worker .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		AN
EARLIER AMERICAN ACADEMY	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		It is interesting to notice how history repeats itself in small things as in great .

		The
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	, which has been given considerable prominence of late , invites comparison with a similar institution that ran its brief career some ninety years ago . ''

		The
American Academy of Language	ORGANIZATION	and Belles Lettres '' apparently owed its inception to the efforts of
William S. Cardell	PERSON	, a now forgotten
New York	LOCATION	linguist and grammarian .

		The object and plan of the proposed organization were announced in a circular issued in
1820	DATE	,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 and later in the same year a constitution was adopted and officers were elected .

		The Academy was located in
New York	LOCATION	, and consisted of resident , corresponding , and honorary members .

		Resident and corresponding members were in every respect on an equality , except that the latter had the privilege of submitting their votes on any subject in writing .

		The number of mem - bers was at first fifty , and this might be increased to a maximum of one hundred and twenty .

		The fees were
twenty-five dollars	MONEY	on admission , and
two dollars	MONEY	a year thereafter .

		It was expected that public-spirited citi - zens who were not members would furnish funds to carry on the work of the

		Meetings were to be held quarterly , and the annual meeting was to be distinguished by a learned address The officers , -- all of whom , it was announced , consented to serve , -- were : President ,
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, LL.D. ; vice-presidents , Hon.
Brockholst Livingston	PERSON	, Hon.
Joseph Story	PERSON	, Hon.

		The prospectus , which to a modern reader seems al - most blatantly patriotic , says of the Academy that '' Its prime object is to harmonize and determine the English language ; but it will also , according to its discretion and means , embrace every branch of useful and elegant literature , and especially whatever relates to our own country . ''

		It was particularly charged with the duty of regulating the introduction of Americanisms , and of con - trolling innovations in spelling .

		Recent correspondence and comment in The Dial render especially interesting a sentence which the authors themselves italicize : '' The Professors of Rhetoric and
Logick	LOCATION	, in our best univer - sities , should at least agree in spelling the names of the im - portant sciences they teach . ''

		A resolution adopted at a meeting held in the
City Hall	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
October 20 , 1820	DATE	, shows something of the aims of the society , and in its wording -- unless it suffered violence from a con - temporary printer -- it furnishes a surprising example of Academic English .

		u Resolved , that a premium of not less than
four hundred dollars	MONEY	, and a gold medal worth fifty dollars , be given to the author , being an American citizen , who within two years shall produce the best written history of the
United States	LOCATION	, and which , with such history shall contain a suitable exposi - tion of the situation , character and interests , absolute and relative , of the American Republic : calculated for a class - book in academies and schools .

		This work is to be examined and approved by a committee of the institution , in reference to the interest of its matter , the justness of its facts and prin - ciples , the purity , perspicuity and elegance of its style , and its adaptation to its intended purpose . ''

		Though it is wished to interfere as little as possible with the freedom of judgment , in authors ; yet it will be expected that the examining committee , in accepting a work which is to receive the premium and sanction of the society , will sug - gest the alteration of any word , phrase or figure , which is not strictly pure and correct , according to the best usage of the English Language . ''

		At later meetings , in
1821	DATE	or 1822 , prizes were offered for other text-books , a gold medal was awarded to
Charles Botta	PERSON	for his History of the American Revolu - tion , and a committee was appointed to compile a list of Americanisms from all parts of the country .

		There is no record of the manner in which this ambi - tious institution came to its end , and , notwithstanding the illustrious list of officers , its whole career is some - what clouded m obscurity .

		There was an evident attempt to make it really national .

		In its latest pub - fished list of members , less than one-third were residents of
New York	LOCATION	, and most of the officers were from other sections of the country .

		With the faculties for com - munication that existed in
1820	DATE	, such an organization was not workable .

		In an article in the '' North Amer - ican Review , ''
Edward Everett	PERSON	, with some show of sec - tional jealousy , implies that the affairs of the Academy were wholly controlled by the
New York	LOCATION	members , if not by the corresponding secretary alone .

		Indeed , the affair may be an illustration of the way in which one enthusiastic and persistent man can organize and keep alive a movement that might conceivably have great significance .

		The institution , however , won letters of commendation , and acceptance of membership and office , from men quite as distinguished as later Academicians , and it called forth in the periodical press comment not very unlike that which is now being bestowed on its successor .

		A `` LIBRARY OF THE MASTERS '' AT MOUNT HOLYOKE COLLEGE -LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The Standard Authors Room , or '' Browsing '' Room , in the new
Smith College Library	ORGANIZATION	, to which you lately called attention , is worthy of wide-spread notice .

		The need of special invitation to the company of choice spirits , wise and witty , in literature , is keenly felt in the colleges , and in society at large , in these days of fierce competition of invitations and engagements .

		This is not the first room and collection dedicated to the delights of the companionship with books .

		Mr.
William E. Foster	PERSON	, librarian of the
Providence	LOCATION	-LRB- R. I. -RRB- Public Library , mused over the idea for several years while the plans were taking shape for a magnificent new building , which , when complete , embodied his thought in an inviting room with the mural motto , '' The books invite you not to study but to taste and read . ''

		Among other libraries which have followed a similar plan is that of
Mount Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	, which devotes a wing , separated by arches from the current periodical room , to its '' Library of the Masters . ''

		It is a favorite corner , partly because of easy chairs and window seats , but also we believe because of the appeal , mute but potent , from the great authors who are there given favorable environment .

		The classes of
1904	DATE	,
1896	DATE	, and
1897	DATE	, at graduation or reunion , have provided funds for > English , Greek and Latin , and German literatures , respectively ; and a few individual donors have given something from other literatures especially desired .

		Futher additions are expected .

		If there are worthy English translations of foreign works , they are wel - comed along with the originals .

		Readings by those who know and love the poets and seers have led their hearers into some new pathways .

		The Biography of a Famous Geologist .

		* The Dwights and the Whitneys have acquitted themselves well in the settling and subduing of the
New England	LOCATION	wilderness , both families hav - ing established themselves in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in
the first half of the seventeenth century	DATE	, and multiplied with the rapidity natural and desir - able in immigrants of sturdy stock .

		No de - scendants of those early settlers have reflected more credit on their ancestry than the large family sprung from the union of
Abel Whitney	PERSON	and
Clarissa Dwight	PERSON	.


Josiah Dwight Whitney	PERSON	, eldest son of these two , business man and banker of
Northampton	LOCATION	, became the father of
Josiah Dwight Whitney	PERSON	-LRB- born in
1819	DATE	-RRB- , the eminent geologist and man of science .


Sarah Willis	PERSON	ton , representative of another good
New England	LOCATION	family , and a woman of unusual loveliness of character and of good mental endowment , was the mother of the young
Josiah	PERSON	and of seven younger children besides .

		To these eight were afterward added five more children by a second marriage of the father .

		But it is the fortunes of the first of the thirteen that here concern us , and that have been ably and interestingly traced by the pen of Mr.
Edwin Tenney Brewster	PERSON	in his '' Life and Letters of
Josiah Dwight Whitney	PERSON	. ''

		The education of parents , as the author re - marks , is gained largely at the expense of the first child ; and so
Josiah	PERSON	was made to pay rather heavily for the parental inexperience of his father and mother .

		Unwise and harsh re - strictions and unduly severe punishments in - duced , it may reasonably be supposed , what is described as '' a certain cloudiness of temper which he never completely outgrew . ''

		Yet he loved his parents none the less warmly , though he showed in more ways than one an edifying determination not to be puritanized out of all capacity to enjoy life to the full and in his own way .

		A favorite sister 's repeated endeavors to bring him to a conviction of sin always found him affectionately and imperturbably unrespon - sive .

		From one of his father 's letters to him when he was attending Stiles French 's private school in
New Haven	LOCATION	, after three years at
Cogswell 's	ORGANIZATION	and
Bancroft 's Eound Hill School	ORGANIZATION	in
Northampton	LOCATION	, we quote a passage character - istic of the writer and of the period . ''

		Nor do I wish you to practice so much self-denial as I was obliged to the first 40 years of my life .

		But you must avoid contracting waste - ful or extravagant habits of any kind , of which self - indulgence is one of the most dangerous .

		Only look forward to the time not far distant when you must provide for your own wants , and you will see the im - portant bearing of the subject .

		You can not then feel an honorable independence , unless you are able to pro- vide for yourself , without asking favors of friends ... Avoid all places of vice or doubtful amusements .

		Never let me hear of your being once seen in an oyster shop , or eating or drinking house , or even
Confectioners	ORGANIZATION	' Shops , unless it be for the purpose of getting sugar plums for the children .

		Such places are in the certain road to ruin . ''

		Preparation for college was completed by young Whitney at
Phillips Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Andover	LOCATION	, and he was graduated from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in his twen - tieth year , well-grounded in the rudiments and accomplished in fencing , riding , dancing , and in playing the violin , flute , and guitar .

		He also drew and painted with a dexterity that served him well when he came to illustrate his own voluminous geological reports in later years .

		Postgraduate study and laboratory work in chemistry followed the college course , and we find him now in
Boston	LOCATION	with Dr.
Jackson	PERSON	-LRB- of renown in connection with the first use of ether as an anaesthetic -RRB- , now in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	with Dr.
Robert Hare	PERSON	, and later in
Paris	LOCATION	, Ber - lin , and other European seats of learning .

		But Dr.
Jackson	PERSON	's interest in geology , as head of the
New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	geological survey , had helped to turn his pupil 's attention to that and kindred branches of science , and this bent be - came more and more confirmed with the passing of time and with the increasingly important and responsible positions offered to him in mining engineering and in more general survey work throughout our then undeveloped West .

		The
California	LOCATION	survey , which came to him in
1860	DATE	and occupied his time until
1874	DATE	when he accepted the Sturgis-Hooper professorship at
Harvard	LOCATION	, may be called the parent of the great national geological survey which is still in progress .

		The author has favored his readers with many of
Whitney	LOCATION	's family and friendly letters .

		They are written with a dash and spirit and a sense of humor that make them the best of reading .

		In a brief season of special study at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	he is found writing to his brother at
Williams	ORGANIZATION	--
William Dwight Whitney	PERSON	, the Sanskritist in embryo -- in the following cheer - ful vein : '' What on earth they wanted to locate a college up among those hills for , I ca n't conceive ; the most aston - ishing part of it is that they find students to stay in

		You must know that I have advanced a step in life ; I have acquired new honors and shed immortal lustre on old
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	by becoming a Resident Graduate .

		That is to say , I signed a piece of paper binding myself , my heirs and executors forever , to pay One Hundred Dollars in case I should run off with any of the books which I expect to obtain from the
College Library	ORGANIZATION	, say an old Indian Grammar or two and a musty history of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	... Having been here more than a fort - night , 1 may consider myself at home , especially at the table , where I do prodigious execution among the muf - fins and baked apples , no doubt much to the dismay of those who feel a deep interest in the motions of my knife and fork .

		... It is forbidden to talk Greek or quote
Patagonian	LOCATION	, so that , although we are very learned , no one would suspect it to hear us talk . ''

		The men of eminence , in science or otherwise , whom the wandering scholar became acquainted with , and who showed a liking and appreciation for him , were many .


Liebig	PERSON	and
Berzelius	PERSON	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	and
Dana and Gibbs	PERSON	,
Theodore Parker	PERSON	and
Starr King	PERSON	and
Eliphalet Nott	PERSON	, all seem to have been considerably more than passing ac - quaintances .

		`` Agassiz is a very fascinating man , ' he writes to his brother
William	PERSON	, `` and it is impossible not to like him , even in ac - knowledging that he , like all the rest of man - kind , has his faults -LRB- except you and me -RRB- .

		Dana is a k brick and no mistake . '

		n His admiration for
Theodore Parker	PERSON	and hearty enjoyment of the arch heretic 's Music
Hall	PERSON	discourses form a significant commentary on his strict upbringing in the town of
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	, and in fact in a house standing on the very site of the
Edwards	PERSON	dwelling .

		The Rev.
Eliphalet Nott	PERSON	, for sixty years president of
Union College	ORGANIZATION	, was past eighty when
Whitney	PERSON	first met him , but had still ten years of work before him .

		He seems to have regarded the young geologist with affection as well as esteem .

		Mrs.
Whitney	PERSON	--
Louisa Howe	PERSON	, to whom
Whitney	PERSON	was married in
1854	DATE	-- writes in a letter to her brother-in-law ,
William	LOCATION	, some words in praise of this remark - able man that are worth quoting here .

		`` I would have come barefoot with scrip and shell and staff to this place -LSB-
Schenectady	LOCATION	-RSB- to do reverence to Dr.
Nott	PERSON	.

		He is even more benevolent and unselfish than your grandfather , with far , far more talent , breadth of range , and depth of thought .

		He is an im - proved St.
John	PERSON	-- as much love and more brains .

		You may imagine how my veneration , which I am generally obliged to feed with a Barmecide dinner of abstracts and ideals , flaps her wings and exults .

		I am perpetually on my knees before this shining reality of worth . ''

		The writer of this enthusiastic letter is not the least interesting character in the book .

		After fifteen years of an unhappy first marriage , she had at last found a worthy object for her affec - tions and her admiration , and though it was a hard and unsettled life she led at first with the wandering geologist , she played her part with cheerfulness and spirit , and was an efficient aid to her husband in various ways .

		With the settlement at
Cambridge	LOCATION	and the occupancy of a professor 's chair in many respects the most desirable of any in
America	LOCATION	, the less eventful portion of
Whitney	LOCATION	's life begins , and may be here rather briefly dismissed .

		The drudgery of teaching was not imposed upon him , though it was to some extent voluntarily assumed .

		Study and research were pursued with what zeal the Sturgis-Hooper professor chose , and in what - ever direction .

		Occupation rather philological than geological was found in assisting his brother
William	PERSON	on the
Century Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, of which Dr.
Benjamin E. Smith	PERSON	was the '' managing editor . ''

		The humors of lexicography under this editor 's supervision are more than once touched upon by Whitney . ''

		I am continually trying to impress it on the Smithian mind , '' he writes to his brother , '' that dictionaries are no authori - ties .

		You have already got some ' gimcracks ' in the C. D. , and very seedy they look ! ''

		Professor
Whitney	PERSON	died in the
summer of 1896	DATE	.

		The impulse he gave to the study of geology in
America	LOCATION	, and the number of com - petent geologists he sent forth from his class - room , are matters regarding which those who know speak with great respect .

		Certain it is that he was the first American geologist of both European training and wide practical expe - rience .

		The story of his life-work , as faithfully and attractively told by Mr.
Brewster	PERSON	, is stim ulating , and also more universal in its appeal than might have been expected .

		A bibliography of fourteen pages , and a long list of '' titles , ap - pointments , and memberships in learned socie - ties of Josiah D wight

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, The Music of Primitive Man .

		* Mr.
Frederick R. Burton	PERSON	, in his book on '' American Primitive Music , '' gives the results of studies made amongst the Indians , chiefly the Ojibways , resident in the regions north of
Lake Huron	LOCATION	and Lake Superior .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	was connected as an expert with the ethnologi - cal departments of the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, and the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		He lived for some time with the Ojibways , and was by them adopted into the tribe .

		He shows genuine sympathy with the customs and habits of the people with whom he deals , and , being himself a musician of learning and experience , seems just the man to make the most of his subject .

		He states that he has taken up this special work on its musical side , and considers its scientific aspects as merely by-products , so far as he is concerned .

		Nevertheless , he has made a real contribution to a discussion of the matter , and is in every sense a witness of unusual discrimina - tion and significance .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	divides the music of the tribes living north of
Mexico	LOCATION	into three sections : that of the Indians of the pueblos , that of the dwellers on the northern
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , that of the inhabitants of the forests and the plains .

		The music of these last is evidently a higher development than that of the others , and the Ojibways appear to have been noteworthy in the character and completeness of their songs .

		The difficulties of observation were clearly many and the musical records obtained require frequent emendation and interpretation .

		The influence of civilization upon the Indian has subjected the native song to a process of modification which makes it frequently very hard , or even impossi - ble , to recover the originals .

		Moreover , civil - ized music has driven the native material into the background , and unless genuine and well - directed efforts are made to collect what is yet to be had , the whole will vanish into the limbo of the outlived and lost , there to mingle with many ghosts whose shrivelled lips give forth no utterance , much as we interrogate and eager as we are to hear .

		The questions which arise in the discussion of primitive music are many .

		A great deal of the latter , of course , can hardly be called music at all , except in the sense that it is the promise of better things to come .

		There is the usual chaos of elements , the vagrant gleams of appre - * Amebican Primitive Music .

Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		hension here and there , the sudden appearance of results , sporadic and followed by a relapse into the precedent confusions .

		According to Mr.
Burton	PERSON	, the song accompanies every activity of the Indian .

		The planting of the corn , the chopping of the fuel , the skimming of the river in the canoe , the setting out on the journey , the courtship and the wedding , the passing of the spirit into immortality , are all sung in a rude and tentative fashion .

		The civilized man does the same ; but the primitive custom is communal and tribal , the hymn or the secular melody has its composer in the whole clan , the famous singer is only one who has signalized himself as a leader of the choir , the music is handed down by tradition subject to the vicissitudes which are part of such a method of transmission .

		The author discusses at length the subjects of Indian Scales , Rhythms , Melodies ; the char - acter of the poetry conjoined to the song ; the possible use of the Indian music as thematic material for the American composer .

		He is not wholly in agreement with other investigators in the same field , -- Dr.
Franz Boas	PERSON	of the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, who has made a study of Esquimo songs , and Mr.
Benjamin Ives Gilman	PERSON	, who has done his work among the Zunis and Hopis and other dwellers in the pueblos of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		The questions that are raised relate to the intervals employed , the scale lying at the basis of the songs , the comparative completeness of the melody .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	, using his observations amongst the Ojibways , gives to the Indian music a considerably higher value than do the others .

		He admits that the Ojibways are exceptional in this direction .

		He seems , however , not to emphasize sufficiently the tribal characteristics of the Indian music .

		This is not the creation of any single composer , but is the work of the tribe in its various activities .

		Like early poetry , it has not been made by any single man , but has come forth at various gatherings of the people , at the war conclaves , or the secular festivals , or the religious ceremonies in which the entire community joins .

		There is , throughout , the constant struggle to attain what is , after all , attained but partially .

		There is the struggle for the correct interval , the struggle for something approaching the scale , the struggle for a consistent melody .

		The rude dweller in the forests and mountains makes his first efforts at musical art ; his sense of rhythm is merely elementary , and he can develop it with only relative consistency ; his power of appreciating intervals is even less satisfactory ,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 for the effort here required is of a higher type , and finds the usual successes and failures ; the adiatonic interval will make its appearance , and in process of time will be eliminated .

		The con - struction of a melody is an achievement which he will struggle towards , but with limited suc - cess ; and beyond that the American forest dweller has apparently no incentive to go .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	probably presents in his songs the last reach of Indian effort in the way of music , and one need not be surprised if he makes all he can out of these melodies , which have in their very incompleteness an alluring quality that gives them a special charm .

		According to statements made in Mr.
Bur	PERSON	- ton 's work , the Indian music is based upon a pentatonic scale , which has both a major and a minor mode .

		It is rare to find the fourth and the seventh in the same song .

		The melody only seldom terminates on the tonic .

		In the matter of rhythm also there are great peculiarities .

		There is often one rhythm in the accompanying drum , another in the vocal score , and a third in the dance in which everybody indulges .

		The only musical instruments which the Indian pos - sesses are the drum and the rattle .

		He makes a rudimentary flageolet ; but the sole use which he knows for it is in his declarations of affection for his inamorata .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	gives a large number of melodies in the form in which the Indian uses them .

		He also translates the words , and has a chapter on Indian poetry .

		The mean - ing of the songs is often not on the surface .

		It sometimes requires an intimate acquaintance with Indian life and habits to get the drift of the words .

		In many cases the text is archaic , and the Indian himself gets small meaning from it .

		Where the text and the melody do not easily flow together , he helps himself over the difficulty by the introduction of meaningless syllables , like our hey , ho , nonino .

		Twenty-eight of these songs are here presented in a civilized version with piano accompaniments .

		They are done with skill , and retain most of their aboriginal flavor in spite of the sophistication .

		It is an open ques - tion , no doubt , to what extent such liberties are to be taken with primitive art .

		The practice , however , may perhaps be defended on the ground that the melody is glorified in the process , and the Indian version in its simplicity is found as well as the ennobled substitute in this book .

		The matter appeals diversely to the musician and the scientist .

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	suggests the use of the Indian melodies as thematic material for American com - posers .

		He deplores the dearth of folk-music among us , and thinks that our poverty in this respect may change into something approaching the European opulence by turning to the un - expected sources of wealth furnished by our mountains and prairies .

		He also alludes to the abundance of tunes , mostly religious , thrust into our lap by the negro .

		It must , however , occur to everyone that this is after all alien material .

		The musician , no doubt , like every artist , has the whole world before him , -- he has Teutonic folk-songs at his disposition , and Norwegian , and Romaic , and others .

		Yet the composer has shown small inclination to overleap national bar - riers .

		Perhaps here is the achievement in music now to be made , and the innovator will under - stand how to find use for material furnished by all parts of the earth ; or has , indeed , the leit - motif ` run its course already , and will a still freer application of musical methods be the purpose of the masters to come ?

		Mr.
Burton	PERSON	has made a satisfactory presenta - tion of his subject .

		He is not to be grudged his right to idealize his man and give the Indian a claim to achievement higher than others have done .

		Probably it is time to do justice in this regard .

		Also , the ethnologist is more in accord with the writer than the latter seems to think he is .

		Moreover , Mr.
Burton	PERSON	has a fluent and entertaining style , and without sacrificing accu - racy or completeness has made a book which was well worth his while .

		The publishers , on their part , have sent out a handsome volume .

		His original endowments and their uninter - rupted development adapted him to this his - torical work .

		Gifted with ready speech and interested in practical questions , in early life he coveted a position in

Feb. 1	DATE	, direction .

		When , nearly at the close of life , he was chosen to represent
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, in
Parliament	LOCATION	, though he performed the labors of the position faithfully , he found them to involve much drudgery , and to use up the strength he would prefer to devote to literary tasks . ''

		The work is physically very tiring , '' he said , '' and I often feel that a good deal of it might be done equally well , with a little train - ing , by a fairly intelligent poodle-dog . ''

		Few historians have so justly estimated their true function , and even fewer have pursued it with equal diligence .

		He aimed to have the facts of the period under consideration fully be - fore him , and to apprehend them with the under - standing of those who were prominent in them .

		He cultivated that breadth of sympathy which enables us to comprehend the actions of our fellow men , and at the same time to recognize their bearings on the general welfare . ''

		History is never more valuable than when it enables us , standing as on a height , to look beyond the smoke and turmoil of our petty quarrels , and to detect in the slow development of the past the great permanent forces that are steadily bearing nations onward to improvement or decay . ''

		He did not limit his attention to the military or civic events in the national story , but strove fully to enter into the forces which were at work at any time to help forward the development of a people .

		History , as a complex of individuals , may be worked out biographically , and so have the zest of personal narrative .

		This is its more fascinating presentation .

		It may also be written in a less personal form , as a combination of forces and motives , often obscure , which are working profoundly or superficially in the minds of men , and , half consciously , controlling their actions .

		While the first form is more entertaining and dramatic , it is liable to carry the entertainment beyond the sober commonplace facts which actu - ally shape events .

		We are more occupied with the fortunes of the boat and the boatmen than we are with the open way and the obstructions of the river itself .

		What we need to know are the conditions and possibilities the time offered to those who are the agents of the public welfare .

		There are two allied but somewhat diverse lines of inquiry in
Lecky	LOCATION	's works .

		The one which first occupied him resulted in the volumes on '' The Rise and Influence of the Spirit of Rationalism '' and '' The History of European Morals , from
Augustus	LOCATION	to Charlemagne . ''

		These both bear on the fundamental terms under which the religious convictions and the ethical char - acter of men are developed .

		No discussion is embarrassed by more prejudice , or calls for more breadth of observation and sympathetic insight .

		These discussions prepared the way for the second forms of inquiry , '' The History of
England	LOCATION	in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' and '' Democracy and Liberty . ''

		Both lines were united in the '' Leaders of Public Opinion in
Ireland	LOCATION	'' and in `` The Map of Life . ''

		The first and higher line of consideration was needful as a preparation for the lower but more comprehen - sive one , embraced in his '' History of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The candor of
Lecky	PERSON	was established in his ear - lier work , and went manifestly with him where its exercise was even more difficult -- in the nar - rative of the eighteenth century which covered a passionate period in English life .

		Other En - glishmen have written influential histories and presented the current of events seething under living forces ; but none have surpassed
Lecky	PERSON	in a wide , quiet , conservative estimate of the influences and motives at work in the English people .

		Carlyle ruffled his narrative with over - powering personal conviction ; events were not given in their integrity , but under the livid light the author cast upon them .

		Buckle read the history of nations as if it had been a palimp - sest whose significance had just been discovered and whose usual interpretation was merely a dis - guise ; he thereby exercised much influence on active minds , but an influence a large part of which was lost again as the natural force of events was restored .

		This detachment of
Lecky	PERSON	was the more remarkable as he was an Irishman , and took a leading part in the discussions of a period which called out much passion .

		He went through the vicissitudes of opinion incident to Home Rule , and in them all he showed the same quiet com - posure of thought .

		No one better deserves per - sonal recollection , or , in the confusion of events , more strongly calls us back to a sober estimate of the forces with which we have to do .

		The memoir of
Lecky	LOCATION	, by his wife , is to be commended for the fulness of the material offered and for its natural arrangement .

		It is not fulsome , as the abundant praise is given by third persons .

		Under the circumstances , it may be pronounced to be a work well done .

		Yet it lacks something of the charm of the very best biography , which we are learning more than hitherto to fashion .

		We have come to desire the weakness and the strength , the successes and the deficiencies , of the life before us , its human as well as its superhuman side .

		We desire a delineation in which we can deeply sympathize , as well in its struggles as in its triumphs .

		THE DIAL 87 seems to have had few frailties .

		He demanded little for himself , and readily gave full apprecia - tive praise to others .

		At times , under the ex - haustion of hard work , he lost mental courage and took a disparaging view of his productions .

		But he was fond of physical beauty , and was able to restore the tone of his mind by a few weeks of uninterrupted enjoyment of nature .

		Nothing really detracts from the merit of
Lecky	LOCATION	, and we need perhaps even the more to know the few obstructions that lay in his path .

		For this work of chastened delineation , a wife is not very well fitted .

		Her best impulses are all on the side of her husband , and recognition of the abatement of his powers or observation of the burdens that oppressed him are liable to bear to her something of the appearance of unfaith - fulness to his memory .

		* The sixth volume of Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's '' Biographic Clinics '' is made up of twenty-two essays which were originally published in the leading medical journals of this country , and completes a series the first volume of which was published in
1903	DATE	.

		Eye-strain and its effects on the human organism have always been the main theme of Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's writings : and a glance at the table of contents of the present volume might lead the reader to judge of it as a collection of technical writings of interest only to the professional world .

		This is , however , not the case ; for the author 's idea has been that the public should be most keenly interested in any medical discovery , or in the new light which study and discovery throw upon any already accepted medical doctrine .

		He has therefore adopted the plan of presenting his theories and the results of his researches in such a way as to appeal to the lay-world as well as to the profession . ''

		Test cases '' may be of clinical value , and are necessary in a volume dealing with a special - ized branch of medicine ; but their interest is limited largely to the physician or the medical student .

		To make their interest more general , and yet illustrate his theory by means of clinical material , Dr.
Gould	PERSON	selected twenty-one of the most prominent characters in literature -LRB- De Quincey ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
George Henry Lewes	PERSON	,

P. Blakiston 's Son & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Parkman , etc. -RRB- , and by carefully gathering from biographies , letters from friends and relatives , and other trustworthy sources , any mention which has been made of their health , he has proved beyond all doubt that all of these char - acters suffered during a part of their lives from some obscure and unexplained disease , and the cause of all their suffering he believes was eye-strain .

		To the general reader it is certainly more interesting to be reminded of Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's aches and pains , or of
Wagner	PERSON	's repeated com - plaints , than to read '' case reports , '' no matter how careful and accurate they may be .

		Dean Swift and '' Some added testimony in the case of Wagner '' are the only illustrious biographic clinics in the volume ; and it is to be regretted that Dr.
Gould	PERSON	feels that his work in this field has been completed .

		Mr.
William Ashton Ellis	PERSON	, who has con - tributed the chapter on
Wagner	PERSON	, '' The
Pessi	PERSON	- mist , '' has enthusiastically accepted Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's theory of eye-strain in the case of
Wagner	PERSON	; and in his monumental '' Life of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	'' he has devoted a whole chapter to this question , concluding that eye-strain and its pathologic and physiologic effects had played an important part in the development of the great musician 's character .

		In his latest book , the '' Letters of Richard to
Minna Wagner	PERSON	, '' we find
Wagner	PERSON	giving fresh proof of his sufferings and of his increasing visual defect .

		A medical theory , however , can not be estab - lished by means of interesting speculation , and it is not enough merely to collect evidence in its favor from the past .

		It must be demonstrated , both as to its theory and application , by its practical results .

		Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's sixth volume , which is the closing one of the series , is a comprehensive review of the entire field of the author 's work in his particular branch of medi - cine , and is a complete resume of his theory of eye-strain and of its far-reaching results .

		The reader of medical literature will find it useful to examine the chapters on the subject of '' Eye - strain and Epilepsy '' or a '' Mysterious Case of Suicide . ''

		The author clears up the myth of Meniere 's disease , and defines the phenomena of a new discovery in ophthalmology under the name of ophthalmovascular choke : while mi - graine , common sick-headache , and many minor ills , come in for their share in the discussion of cases selected for his '' Brief Biographic Clinics upon living patients . ''

		All of these articles are written with remark - able clearness and directness , and the unhesi - tating emphasis used throughout the book 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, compels and holds the interest of the reader .

		Dr.
Gould	PERSON	is fully in possession of his facts , and crowds into a few pages the result of his wide reading and matured thought .

		The articles which best illustrate his skill in the vivid and concise exposition of new ideas are the chapters entitled '' Vision and Senility '' and the '' Role of Visual Function in Animal and Human Evolution . ''

		The cause of senility has been the subject of much discussion by eminent patholo - gists during the past few years .

		It has been attributed either to the hardening of the arter - ies , the weakening of the , heart , to changes in the cells , or to germs in the blood and body .

		Dr.
Gould	PERSON	, however , claims that these are the results of senility , not its cause .

		The real cause , he tells us , is in the eyes .

		At the age of forty-five or fifty most men and women begin to have impaired vision ; their ability to work fails ; their usefulness is diminished ; and they are forced into inactivity which speedily affects their interest and purpose .

		They are practi - cally '' laid aside '' or '' put on the shelf , '' accord - ing to their own words , and slip quickly into the helpless senility of old age .

		If , on the con - trary , they have passed the critical or presbyopic period without losing any of their visual acumen , they are still capable of continuing a life of achievement .

		Knowledge , experience , and judg - ment , added to the results gained by a long life of study and reading , are the acquisitions and activities which should accompany increasing years .

		Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's philosophy on this subject should be an inspiration to all those who find themselves growing old . ''

		The Role of the Visual Function in Animal and Human Evolution '' does not refute
Darwin	PERSON	's principles of evolution , but enlarges them by showing that one of the chief causes for the development of the fit , and for the elimination of the unfit , has been the fitness or unfitness of the eyes for the struggle attendant upon exist - ence .

		The biologic origin of the eye and the stages of development through which it has passed are explained .

		Only a scientist who has carefully studied this subject could have presented so clearly the complex factors in this development , and we are indebted to Dr.
Gould	PERSON	for giving us the results of his labors in this most interesting field of original research .

		The Old South Society of

		Two
Great Foes of Slavery	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Two statesmen could hardly be more different the one from the other than were the two great leaders of the Republican party whose newly - written Lives appear before us for review .

		In almost every personal characteristic they were opposites , as they were in training , experience , and environment .

		One was a
New England Brahmin	LOCATION	, cold , domineering , exclusive , ultra - refined , a devotee of art and literature , abso - lutely without the sense of humor and with little knowledge of human nature .

		The other was a
Kentucky	LOCATION	poor-white , genial , approachable , self - trained and without formal culture , bubbling over with humor , knowing the hearts of men .

		Even their leading motives were not the same : Lincoln , much as he hated slavery , thought first of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and its preservation ; while the wrongs of the Negro , the wickedness of the men who wronged him , and the righting of those wrongs , were first in Sumner 's mind .

		Sumner had not the balance , the sense of proportion , the saving salt of humor , that
Lincoln	PERSON	had ; and his fame is already growing dim , while that of Lincoln increases steadily .

		Sumner could never have foreseen this ; for he failed to under - stand Lincoln , he patronized him , and lectured him mercilessly , while he felt perfectly sure of his own fame .

		Professor
Haynes	PERSON	, in his new Life of Sumner , illustrates the eclipse of that statesman 's reputation by the answers submitted to college entrance examinations in
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts .

		He says : '' Not one in ten of those boys in the commonwealth which Sumner had so long and so honorably represented showed any intelligent knowledge of the man .

		One re - plied : c
Charles Sumner	PERSON	was always held in respect , even by the people of the South .

		Fort Sumner ,
Charleston	LOCATION	, was named in his honor ' -- an honor which several of the other papers also accorded him ! ''

		The comparative fame of
Lincoln	LOCATION	and Sumner at this time is curiously shown by the fact that while one can get a fair idea of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's whole career from
Haynes	PERSON	's
Life of Sumner	ORGANIZATION	, the name of Sumner is not found at all in
Putnam	LOCATION	's
Life of Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		With all
Sumner	PERSON	's limitations , he did most efficient service at a crisis when he was the man for the hour , and his position is sure in the rank of our leading statesmen if not of our popular ♦

		THE DIAL 89 heroes .

		Professor
Haynes	PERSON	's book is a clear and well-balanced formal biography of moderate size , its size and scope dictated by the requirements of the well-known series of American biographies to which it is added .

		The author shows himself a thorough student of the period , and his literary style is pleasing and effective .

		As the life of Sumner can not be written apart from the leading political events of the exciting quarter-century between
1850	DATE	and
1875	DATE	, the book is a readable and in the main trustworthy sketch of our national history during the Civil War era , as well as a good political biography of a forceful and interesting man .

		We can not here under - take to follow through the outline of the book , which in the main takes the usual course familiar to students of the period .

		It will be a good reference-book for younger students of American history , and will interest readers who desire to become acquainted with the great men of the past century and lack time or energy for the mastery of the more extended biographies .

		The book naturally challenges comparison with the
Life of Sumner	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Moorfield Storey	PERSON	, issued in the '' American Statesmen Series '' ten years ago .

		Inevitably they are much alike , being written from the same point of view , each for a series of political biographies .

		The book of Professor
Haynes	PERSON	is rather fuller on the per - sonal side , and shows us more of the man .

		It is also more interestingly written ; the author has not been overwhelmed by the mass of his mate - rial , but has organized and given life to the story he had to tell .

		Major Putnam 's book is quite different , being a brief sketch of Lincoln and his work , enlarged from a centennial address given a year ago .

		Its origin indicates its character .

		Few details are given as the basis for characterization and appre - ciation , only the larger aspects of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's life being included in the treatment .

		There is little to mark the sketch as noteworthy until the Civil War is reached : here the writer 's own experi - ences in the army , and his personal relations to men and events , add life to the sketch and give it value .

		But it is chiefly what it purports to be , an enlarged memorial address .

		Included in the volume is the text of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's
Cooper Institute	ORGANIZATION	speech , one of the greatest of American speeches , and one that had an important influ - ence in the shaping of history .

		Recognizing its greatness and anticipating its influence , two young lawyers ,
Charles C. Nott	PERSON	and
Cephas Brainerd	PERSON	, later leaders of the
New York	LOCATION	bar , had the address corrected by Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, and published with introduction and elaborate his - torical notes .

		This pamphlet , and the accom - panying correspondence with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	never before published , gives the book unique interest for the historical student .

		Collected in one volume , the mis - Addresses and essays , personal cellaneou8 contributions to historical and historical , writing made by Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	during the past ten years are published under the title '' Historical Essays '' -LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- If more exact definition were needed , the title might be enlarged to '' Essays on Historical `` Writers and Writings . ''

		In one group would fall the addresses delivered to historical societies on the historians
Gibbon	PERSON	,
Gardiner	PERSON	,
Lecky	PERSON	,
Green	ORGANIZATION	, and Sir
Spencer Walpole	PERSON	, of the English school , and on
Edward L. Pierce	PERSON	,
John D. Cox	PERSON	,
Edward Gaylord Bourne	PERSON	, and
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	, American writers .

		To another group belong four occasional addresses on '' History , '' `` Concerning the Writing of History , '' `` The Pro- fession of Historian , '' and `` Newspapers as Historical Sources . ''

		The four remaining productions comprise a critical discussion of the presidential office , a re - view of the administration of President
Hayes	PERSON	, a new estimate of Cromwell based on
Gardiner	PERSON	's lec - tures , and an effort to prove that
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, S. C , was burned by looters of the city during the Civil War , and not by executive order .

		In these essays Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	preserves the painstaking accuracy characteristic of his former writings , but displays a slightly different style , since he is freed from the trammels of condensed narrative and has leisure to introduce a wealth of apt quotation .

		There is also the attractive personal note of a composition intended to be read to an audience .

		Especially does this be - come manifest in the personal tribute to the late
E. G. Bourne	PERSON	, who was sometime an amanuensis to Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	.

		The essay on the presidential office is the most distinct contribution to historical writing , being descriptive of the contributions of each president to the prerogatives of the office .

		Hayes is praised for his '' steadiness and equanimity '' in office , and for his '' serene amiability and hopefulness . ''

		Several of the essays are reprinted from magazines .

		The volume as a whole will be read with pleasure by the many admirers of the writings of this scholarly author .

		If the lover of autobiographies -- a Sta P r kind of Hterature which * ver y aW dant in these days -- has never yet fathomed the secret of their fascination , now is the time for him to do so by reading Mrs.
Anna Robeson Burr	PERSON	's excellent book , '' The Autobiography : A Critical and Comparative Study '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Two hundred and sixty-five '' capital autobiographies , '' in various languages , have been scrutinized by Mrs. 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
Burr	PERSON	from sundry points of view , with reference to their motive , their greater or less subjectivity , the occupation and character of the writer , the strength or weakness of memory displayed , and so on .

		Five appended tabulations group and re-group the works according to divers schemes , and a full index fur - nishes still another survey of the authors discussed .

		In any such attempt as this to bring scientific method to bear on subject-matter that refuses to be bounded by the strict demarcations of science , there is neces - sarily much of personal bias and individual opinion .

		For example , in speaking of the greater objectivity manifest in `` the intellectual life of elder civiliza - tions , '' Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	declares that '' this difference separates the ancient world from the modern as tangibly as a wall or a ditch '' -- which reminds one of the now discredited catastrophic theory of geologic change .

		She makes subjectivity , in a pro- nounced form , to begin with the Christian era , at least as far as the literary manifestation is concerned ; as if , centuries before , the Hindu and the Chinese mind had not attained to self-consciousness and left written evidence of the fact ; and as if the subjective element were not discernible even in certain of the ancient Greeks and Romans .

		Cicero , for instance , in his letters , his orations , and his philosophical writings , was very far from being dispassionately objective .

		On a later page she speaks of Caesar in the same breath with '' our basis for the general and particular study of sincerity , '' linking his name with
Augustine	PERSON	's and
Cardano 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		But if any chronicler of his own achievements ever understood the art of throwing dust in his reader 's eyes , the self-styled conqueror of
Gaul	ORGANIZATION	must be accounted an adept .

		An illuminat - ing word on this has recently come from
Signor Ferrero	PERSON	's pen .

		However , these points must not be pressed unfairly .

		It is a new and far from easy task that Mrs.
Burr	PERSON	has undertaken .

		With the exception of Professor
Georg Misch	PERSON	's '' Geschichte der Auto - biographien , '' of which the first volume has just appeared , and is noted by her after sending her own book to the press , her work is the only one of its kind in the field ; and its marks of painstaking industry , of careful thought , and of genuine enthusiasm , are too many to admit of aught , on the reviewer 's part , but hearty commendation of the book .

		`` The Old Librarian 's Almanack , '' published at New Haven in
1773	DATE	, and attributed to Master
Jared Bean	PERSON	, Curator of the
Connecticut Society of Antiquarians	ORGANIZATION	, is now re-issued as the first number of '' The Libra - rian 's Series '' edited by Messrs.

		The editor of this rare pamphlet is Mr.
Edmund Lester Pearson	PERSON	, -LRB- '' Librarian '' of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript '' -RRB- , who has already printed in that journal some choice extracts from the
Almanack	LOCATION	.

		After a brief preface setting forth all that is known about Master Bean and his Almanack -LRB- of which latter only two copies are now believed to be extant -RRB- , Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	leaves the reader Maxims of an old-school librarian .

		to revel at will in the unannotated pages of the unconscious humorist who has chosen to sign him - self '' Philobiblos '' -LRB- in Greek characters -RRB- . ''

six weeks of summer	DATE	when doors are closed and all books have been called in and restored to their places on the shelves .

		With Sir
Thomas Bodley	PERSON	, he scouts the notion that domestic cares can be made compatible with a librarian 's duties .

		Speaking of women and their blandishments , he admonishes us to '' Shun them as you would the Devil . ''

		And again , as to admitting women to a library : '' Be suspicious of Women .

		They are given to the Reading of frivo - lous Romances , and at all events , their presence in a Library adds little to -LRB- if it does not , indeed , de - tract from -RRB- that aspect of Gravity , Seriousness and Learning which is its greatest Glory . ''

		A '' warder of the accumulated record of the world 's wisdom , '' he elsewhere says , should be '' a person of sober and Godly life , learn 'd , virtuous , chaste , moral , frugal and temperate . ''

		Entering into the details of libra - rianship , he gives rules and advice that will move the modern librarian to mirth .

		Rhymed maxims , too , are scattered down the calendar pages , as , '' Let no intruders put your ease in doubt , Lock fast the door & keep the rascals out . ''

		The right-hand pages are devoted to more detailed and serious discussion of matters interesting to '' bibliothecaries . ''

		In one instance this discussion takes metrical form , begin - ning , '' First of all matters , ' t is your greatest need To read unceasing & unceasing read . ''

		A rare treat is in store for all readers of '' The Old Librarian 's Almanack . ''

Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , to frighten the peaceful civilian into a consciousness of his unpreparedness to repel a Japanese invasion .

		The book is divided into two parts , -- the first dealing with general principles , such as the -LRB- supposed -RRB- inevitability of continual warfare as long as human nature remains human nature , and the unquestioned superiority of trained soldiers to raw recruits ; and the second expounding , in a manner terrifying to the dweller on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , the ease with which the Mikado could seize upon that fair portion of our domain , under circumstances that exist at present .

		Our sole salvation , thinks Mr.
Lea	PERSON	, lies in a formidable standing army and a mighty navy .

		He would have our navy made double the strength of any European navy .

		But why stop there ?

		One could take the author more seriously if he did not indulge in so many questionable gen - eralizations and assumptions .

		But when , for exam - ple , he asserts as an '' invariable law '' that '' the boundaries of political units are never , other than for a moment of time , stationary -- they must either expand or shrink , '' he is formulating a plausible enough theory , but one refuted by actual experience .


Switzerland	LOCATION	, -- to take but one instance , -- has been acknowledged as an independent nation since

		There is much in the book , however , that is of universal application , and it will doubtless appeal to some of our own librarians .

		There are a few books in the American book-market on '' How to Read , '' or '' Books Worth Reading , '' and so on , most of them having chapters on the use of libraries ; but there has not been col - lected in any one place sufficient practical informa - tion on the best use of libraries , and of their tools and accessories -- catalogues and bibliographies .

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's book is not one to be followed too explicitly ; for example , it makes no mention of inter-library loans , nor of the machinery of the library itself , a knowledge of which would certainly be of value to the users of libraries .

		The chapter on '' Guides to Books '' seems too closely confined to English bibli - ography ; this results in some cases in undue mea - greness , even for so short a list as is here intended .

Alice Meynell	PERSON	-RRB- under the title , ``
Ceres	LOCATION	' Runaway , and Other Essays '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		The `` runaway '' that gives its name to the opening essay is the grass or other verdure which grows in the streets and squares of
Rome	LOCATION	, in defiance of paving-stones and street-cleaners , and for which the author confesses a lurking fondness .

		As was to be expected from Mrs.
Meynell	PERSON	, most of her pages betray more or less opeidy a predilection for things Italian ; nor is this touch of enthusiasm a blemish on her work .

		The mere language of the country , and its patois , stir her to eloquence .

		So slight a phrase as piuttosto bruttini has a wonderf ul charm for her , though why she chooses the plural rather than the singular of the diminutive adjective for her praise does not appear .

		She contrasts our unmusical English with the liquid speech of
Italy	LOCATION	, but nevertheless finds a redeeming virtue in that convenient negative prefix , un , common to German and to English .

		But in denying that the French enjoy the use of a similar prefix with the participle , after the analogy of our '' unloved '' and '' unfor - given , '' she forgets the occurrence of a few such words as inoui , inconnu , inhabits .

		She has an untrite chapter on the trite subject of laughter , and three excellent ones on certain characteristics of children , evidently based on first-hand knowledge .

		Her style throughout possesses distinction , now and then verging on preciosity , and occasionally some - what marred by little affectations -- as her repeated spelling of `` judgment '' with a superfluous e. Far better , however , these small blemishes of over - carefulness than the looseness and wantonness com - mon to so many prose writers of our day .

Crowell	PERSON	in their '' Library of Economics and Politics . ''

		The book is provided with much new material , and is brought thoroughly up to date .

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- of

Italy	LOCATION	from the II .

		to the

last year	DATE	's celebration of the centenary of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		The
February	DATE	'' Century '' contains many apprecia - tions of its late editor , Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	, with consideration of various phases of Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's public activities , by
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	,
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	,
Jacob A. Riis	PERSON	,
Cecilia Beaux	PERSON	, and
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	; and tributes by President
Taft	PERSON	, Ambassador
Bryce	PERSON	,
John Burroughs	PERSON	,
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93
Helen Keller	PERSON	, and many others , who knew and loved the man .

		There is also a reproduction of the portrait painting by
Cecilia Beaux	PERSON	, and of Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's last serious poem , '' Love in a City . ''

		The announcement is definitely made that Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	, who has long shared with Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	the editorial responsibility of '' The Century , '' now becomes the chief editor .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	is a capable and experienced man , and the interests of the magazine are not likely to suffer in his hands .

		The '' Librarian 's Series , '' of which the first number is noticed in another column of this issue , will include , besides '' The Old Librarian 's Almanack , '' '' The Rev.
John Sharpe	PERSON	and his Proposal for a Pubbck Library at
New York	LOCATION	,

Austin Baxter	PERSON	Keep ; `` The Librarian , '' being selections from the department thus named of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Evening Transcript , '' and written by Mr.

		Among
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's odd comments on this country , after his memorable visit here a few years before his death , is a remark -LRB- referring to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' -RRB- about a paper `` written by
Godkin	PERSON	, an expatriated Anglo-Irishman . ''

		This queer conception of a journal '' written '' by its editor is carried out quite literally in '' The Forerunner '' of Mrs.
Charlotte Perkins Gilman	PERSON	, the third monthly issue of which is before us .

		It is written from beginning to end by its editor , who is also publisher and business manager , -- not improbably compositor and bookkeeper as well .

		Editorials , notes , comments , even stories and poems , are all from her ready and versatile pen .

		For the first time in her life , says Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	, she is able to print such of her writings as she wishes to , and not such as editors will let her print .

		To one of her ardent and vital temperament , this must be a joy indeed , and we hope it will be one forever .

		Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	is a forceful and stimulating writer , with plenty of convictions and no lack of courage for them .

		No one is likely to fail of getting a full dollar 's worth , who sends that amount for a year 's subscription to '' The Forerunner , '' 67 Wall Street ,
New York	LOCATION	.

BJORNSTJERNE BJORNSON	PERSON	.

		The time is fast approaching when the twen - tieth century will have to produce its own great writers .

		The ranks of the surviving nineteenth - century veterans are rapidly thinning , and of their intellectual leaders few remain .

		To con - sider the giants only , the men of immensely resonant voice , we have recently had to mourn the loss of
Carducci	PERSON	and of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, still more recently of
Swinburne	LOCATION	and
Meredith	PERSON	; and now the vigorous personality of
Bjornson	PERSON	is likely to exist henceforth only in the books that are the transcript of his life .

		When he and his great compeer Tolstoy shall pass , the slate will be wiped clean .

		It seems more than likely that we shall then realize the reverse of
Emer	PERSON	- son 's aphorism , '' When half-gods go , the gods arrive , '' and look in vain for the lineaments of authentic divinity in the faces of those among the living who seek to fill the places of the great departed .

		The capricious distribution of genius among men has never been more strikingly illustrated than by the fact that one of the smallest of nationalities has given to the modern world two of its most dominant literary personalities .

		Which of the two was the greater , may not now be determined .

		Against the supremacy of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's dramatic technique , and the trenchancy of his social surgery , we must put the far wider range of
Bjornson	PERSON	, his more comprehensive sympathies , and his more vital and impressive individuality .

		The balance has seemed of late years to incline in the favor of the former ; but we are disposed to believe that in the eventual adjustment the latter will tip the scale .


Bjorn	PERSON	- son has not yet been adequately presented to the English-speaking public .

		We know him as a novelist only , imperfectly as a dramatist , and hardly at all as a lyrist .

		As the singer pure and simple , his native idiom -LRB- as with all lyric poets -RRB- opposes an impassable barrier to foreign understanding ; as a dramatist , he has not yet come to his own in other countries than his own ; his international fame rests at present upon his tales -- the naive idylls of his earlier years , and the later work freighted with the deepest soul - concerns of the modern man -- and , in a lesser 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, measure , upon his identification with many of the political and social movements of his time .


Bjbrnstjerne Bjornson	PERSON	was born at
Kvikne	LOCATION	,
December 8 , 1832	DATE	, -- four years after
Ibsen	PERSON	.

		He was sprung from hardy peasant stock , and his childhood was passed in one of the wildest and most picturesque parts of
Norway	LOCATION	, the legend-haunted region of the Romsdal and the Dovref jeld .

		He was educated at
the University of Christiania	ORGANIZATION	, and his first book was published in
1857	DATE	, when he was completing his twenty - fifth year .

		That book was ''
Synnbve Solbakken	PERSON	, '' and it was truly epoch-making , for it was the beginning of a new literature , fresh from the soil and untrammelled by academic or alien in - fluences , for his native country .

		The following fifteen years were richly fruitful , and made him the foremost figure in the national life .

		They were the years that produced ''
Arne	PERSON	, '' '' En Glad Gut , '' and '' Fiskerjenten , '' which form with '' Synnbve '' the famous group of peasant idylls ; the years in which the great saga-dramas were written , including ``
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	, '' ``
Sigurd Jorsalfar	PERSON	, '' and ''
Kong Sverre	PERSON	, '' and the years in which his songs found their way to the hearts of the Norwegian people as no songs had ever reached them before .

		During this period he also produced his one long poem , ''
Arnljot Gelline	PERSON	, '' an epic cycle of the clash between heathendom and the Christian faith , his ''
Mary Stuart i Skot	PERSON	- land , '' and the first of the social plays that were to represent so large a part of the activity of his later years .

		Bjornson had all these things to his credit before he had reached the age of forty .

		He had become the voice of his people , the incarnation of all that was best and deepest in the national life of
Norway	LOCATION	.

		It seemed hardly possible for a man to achieve greater fame , yet in the early seventies a new
Bjornson	PERSON	took the field , with a vastly broadened outlook , and a new power to compel attention .

		He had been reading widely and to effective purpose ; he had plunged into the mid-current of advancing thought ; he had acquired the full spiritual franchise of the modern European .

		No longer bound by the fetters of a narrow orthodoxy in religion , or of the provincial spirit in politics , he had raised himself to a more commanding plane , not indeed of creative art but of intellectual power .

		His work from this time on was to be the vehicle of a message , the result of an imperious mandate to enlist in the world-wide struggle for the eman - cipation of the body and the soul of man .

		Like his most famous fellow-worker in this struggle , he found in dramatic composition his most effective weapon .

		During the last thirty - five years of his life he produced upwards of a dozen social dramas , providing a series of object - lessons no less impressive than those which
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	was providing during the same period and by the same agency .

		The first of these plays were '' Redaktbren '' -LRB- The Editor -RRB- and '' En Fallit '' -LRB- A Bankruptcy -RRB- , preceding by two years the first of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's modern series .

		The former of the two is a fierce satire upon modern journal - ism ; the latter , a trenchant discussion of the ethics of business life . ''

		En Hanske M -LRB- A Glove -RRB- is perhaps the most contentious of these modern plays ; it has for its theme the double standard of sexual morality .

		The two plays linked by the common title of '' Over ^ vne '' -LRB- Beyond the Strength -RRB- are singularly powerful and appealing .

		One is religious in theme , and the other social ; but the teaching of both is to the effect that much of the best human energy goes to waste because it attempts to realize im - possible ideals .

		The greatest of all these modern plays is '' Kongen '' -LRB- The King -RRB- , a study of the institution of monarchy , and an implicit demon - stration of its anachronistic character .

		Why this work , to say nothing of others , has failed to find its way to our English stage , is a matter that passes comprehension .

		During these years of dramatic fecundity , the pen of the novelist was by no means idle .

		Half a dozen works of fiction , including two of major importance , have appeared from time to time , offering as striking a contrast to the peasant idylls as the modern plays offer to the saga-dramas .

		We do not know which is the more marvellous : that '' Arne '' and '' Det Flager '' should have been written by the same hand , or that ''
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	'' and '' Kongen '' should have been brought forth by the same mind .

		`` Det
Flager	PERSON	i Byen og paa Havnen '' -LRB- Flags are Flying in
City	LOCATION	and Harbor -RRB- is a work of fiction in a qualified sense only .

		It is of the lineage of '' Emile '' and ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	, '' and is at once a study in heredity and an exposition of educational ideals . ''

		Paa Guds Veje '' -LRB- In God 's Ways -RRB- is a work so noble and rich and beautiful that it beggars critical appraisement .

		With its delicate and vital de - lineations of character , its rich sympathy and depth of tragic pathos , its plea for the sacred - ness of human life and its protest against the religious and social prejudice by which life is so often misshapen , this book is an epitome of all the ideas and feelings that have gone to the making of the author 's personality and have received such manifold expression in his works .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		109 This is the book that illustrates
Bjornson	PERSON	's genius in its ripe fruitage , as its rich early flow - ering was illustrated by '' Arne '' and ''
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	'' and the lyrics .

		When we remember that besides his triple distinction as novelist , dramatist , and poet , BjornsoD has served the public in many other capacities , we begin to realize how great a figure is fading into the past .

		He has been the director of three theatres , the editor of three newspapers , the promoter of schools and patri - otic organizations , the participant in many politi - cal campaigns , the lay preacher of private and public morals , and the chosen orator of his nation for all great occasions .

		When one com - pares him with Ibsen in such respects as these , the contrast is as great , let us say , as that between
Henri Quatre	PERSON	at
Ivry	ORGANIZATION	and
Phillip II	PERSON	.

		in the
Escorial	LOCATION	.

		In private life also he was as ebullient and genial as his famous compeer was self-centred and reserved .

		When so magnifi - cent a personality as his disappears from among men , the most skeptical may wonder if there be not some kernel of transcendental truth in
Arnold	LOCATION	's verses : '' O strong soul , by what shore Tarriest thou now ?

		For that force , Surely , has not been left vain !

		Somewhere , surely , afar , In the sounding labour-house vast Of being , is practised that strength , Zealous , beneficent , firm . ''

		Sometime in the seventies , when the first of his two periods was ended ,
Bjornson	PERSON	became a country farmer at Aulestad in the
Gausdal	LOCATION	, where he purchased an estate and led a patri - archal life , bestowing hospitable welcome upon the guests that thronged to him from many lands .

		Most of his winters , however , were spent abroad , in
Munich	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, or
Paris	LOCATION	; and one of them -LRB- 1880-81 -RRB- was spent in those parts of the
United States	LOCATION	where Norwegians most abound .

		We have precious memories of his brief sojourn in
Chicago	LOCATION	-- of the eloquence with which he addressed an afternoon audience in MeVicker 's Theatre , and of the rare evening of informal converse when a few of his friends in this far-off country were taken into the privi - lege of his intimate companionship .

		It is good news that Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	is preparing a new edition of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's Letters .

		The whole correspondence will be incorporated in one work , and there will be additions .

		Many of
Stevenson	PERSON	's best letters are still in manuscript ; but the reasons which have postponed their publication are disappearing .

		THE CENTENARY OF
AMERICA	LOCATION	'S FIRST NOV ELIST .

		A hundred years ago , on the
22d of this month of February	DATE	, there died in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	the first American novelist , who was also a pioneer American journalist ,
Charles Brockden Brown	PERSON	.

		He had won neither fame nor worldly success , and his passing attracted scarcely any attention among his contem - poraries .

		His name has gradually become familiar to students of literature , but his personality is still veiled in shadow .

		Until a recent date his unmarked grave in Friends ' Burial Ground could not be accu - rately known .

		Two surveys of his writings appeared in
Blackwood	LOCATION	's journals , in
1820	DATE	and
1824	DATE	, in which the English reviewers expressed just , if somewhat exaggerated , reproach toward Americans for their indifference to the work and memory of this man who blazed the way for later American romancers , and encouraged and practised , at great self-sacrifice , the cultivation of literature as a life-work .

		The main incidents of
Brown	PERSON	's life , as given in disjointed form by his friend and counsellor ,
William Dunlap	PERSON	, merely suggest his temperamental traits and the yearnings of his soul for sympathy and vital expression .

		With blended ancestry of Quakers and Normans , he had an alert mind and an unfet - tered fancy , with a physique that was ever frail .

		As a boy , he was precocious , over-sensitive , and rest - less ; as a man , he was introspective to a degree of morbidity , impelled by high ideals , and self-depre - ciatory because he failed to attain to his aspirations .

		He deferred to his father 's wishes , and studied law ; but he decided that he must defy his family and venture all his hopes on literature , else he would prove traitor to his own mind and soul .

		From his
Philadelphia	LOCATION	home he went to
New York	LOCATION	, in
1797	DATE	, to the home of Dr.
Elihu Smith	PERSON	, where he passed through the tragic experiences of an attack of yel - low fever aud the loss of his host and best friend from the same disease .

		After a few months in the home of
William Dunlap	PERSON	at
Perth Amboy	LOCATION	,
Brown	PERSON	returned to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to pass the rest of his life .

		In a manuscript letter to
Dunlap	PERSON	-LRB- now in the His - torical Society of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	-RRB- , written a year after his return , we find allusions to his first efforts at novel-writing , under the stimulus of Dr.
Smith	PERSON	, and also strong evidence of the morose moods which sometimes overwhelmed him .

		* ' I think upon the life of
last winter	DATE	with self-loathing almost unsupportable .

		Alas , my friend , few consolations of a self - approving mind have fallen to my lot .

		... I am sometimes apt to think that few hnman beings have drunk so deeply of the cup of self-abhorrence as I have ... Whether it will end but with my life , I know not . ''

		Below this letter is a significant note , signed ``
W. Dunlap	PERSON	, '' saying . ''

		So at certain moments could think & write one of the purest , best-beloved of men . ''

		Brown 's first book , ''
Alcuin	PERSON	, '' was a dialogue - essay on the then novel subject of
Equal Suffrage	ORGANIZATION	, which appeared as u Rights of Women '' in a jour - nal with the cumbersome title , '' Weekly Magazine 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, of Original Essays , Fugitive Pieces , and Interesting Intelligence , '' Vol .

		I. -LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, 1798 -RRB- .

		This argument on a subject of current discussion is inter - esting to-day , in spite of its diffuse and extravagant phrasing ; it reveals the progressive ideas and broad mental outlook which characterized
Brown	PERSON	's later editorials and political pamphlets .

		The four novels by which he is classified in literature -- ''
Wieland	PERSON	, '' ''
Ormond	PERSON	, '' ''
Arthur Mervyn	PERSON	, '' and ''
Edgar Hunt	PERSON	- ley '' -- appeared from the press within two years , although earlier versions of portions of two stories had appeared in
New York	LOCATION	journals .

		If the reader has patience to pass by their florid emotionalism and fantastic melodrama , he will discover a few realistic descriptions of American scenery and char - acter .

		The two later efforts at fiction , ''
Jane Tal	PERSON	- bot '' and ''
Clara Howard	PERSON	, '' are amatory letters of a vapid type .

		Within the four representative novels are reflected certain fancies , superstitions , and men - tal hallucinations , which were rife among the masses of the American people at the close of the eighteenth century .

		Brown chose a few of these agitating and haunting suggestions as motives in his novels , -- namely , ventriloquism , elixir of life , somnambulism , and the fearful memories of yellow fever and Indian forays .

		Brown 's work as novelist ended when he was thirty ; it was the immature and disjointed product of a fertile fancy and zealous brain , eager to express original conceptions , yet hampered by the influence of English models by
Godwin	PERSON	, Mrs.
Radcliffe	PERSON	, and their kind .

		During the remaining nine years of his life ,
Brown	PERSON	was a hard-working , aspiring journalist , undaunted in spirit and in a determination to increase the knowledge and widen the tastes of the American public .

		Relatively , his journalistic experiments had titles longer than their subscription lists ; yet they won a moderate patronage , and exerted , indirectly , a far-reaching influence for the appreciation of world - literature of all forms among a people who were sadly provincial .

		A lack of humor was a great drawback to
Brown	PERSON	's happiness in life , and a defect in his literary work .

		His seriousness and melancholy were doubtless reactionary symptoms from his physical weakness .

		He longed , in verbose phrase , for `` that lightness and vivacity of mind which the divine flow of health , even in calamity , produces in some men . ''

		While the last years of his life were weakened by anaemia and tuberculosis , yet his mental and emo - tional faculties were stimulated by a happy marriage to Miss
Elizabeth Linn	PERSON	, and the mingled joys and anxieties of parenthood .

		A manuscript letter to his wife ,
June 17 , 1806	DATE	, written from
Albany	LOCATION	-LRB- Library of Historical Society of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	-RRB- , shows a cheerful mood and a deep love for his family .

		A single sentence is a good example of his typical labored form , which might have been simplified by a sense of humor : '' You confirm my prognostics that the lovely babes will scamper about house , by the time of my return . ''

		To the closing day of his life , he maintained a marvellous activity of mind and pen , and tried to soften the approaching sorrow for his family by an unfailing courage and a tender consideration for them .

		A deep and pervasive loyalty to his country , and faith in her political supremacy and intellectual awakening , were cherished in the heart of
America	LOCATION	's first novelist and expressed in varied forms in his writings .


Washington	LOCATION	Irving acknowledged his debt to
Brown	PERSON	for inspiration to persist in literary en - deavors to widen the tastes and mental horizon of
America	LOCATION	.

		Brown could not combine his fantasies and realistic scenes into an artistic product ; his con - struction was weak , and his portrayals , with few exceptions , were ineffective .

		He was , however , con - stantly aspiring to combine the visionary with the realistic , and his life was noble and productive in spite of many blighting influences .

		He wrote occa - sional verse , generally a bit of rhapsodic musing , like this stanza from a manuscript poem , '' L'
Amoroso	PERSON	, '' presented by his son to
Frank M. Etting	PERSON	, and now in the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		From pleasure 's walks and market-places ; Stilly Groves and lonely Hills ; From gay carousals , thronging faces ,
Moonlight Glades	LOCATION	and warbling rills ; From fighting fields and stormy Seas ; From courtly pomp and war 's array ; From State turmoils and letter 'd Ease ; Come , my enamoured Soul , away !

		From haunts that moonstruck Fancy wooes , Where Nymphs resort , and Muses roam , From all that vulgar dreams abuse , Come home , Ecstatic Thought , come home ! ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The late
Edouard Rod	PERSON	, whose novels have a considerable circulation outside his own country , and whose lectures in
America	LOCATION	about ten years ago can - not yet have been forgotten , is the subject of a re - cent appreciative essay from the pen of
M. Henri Chantoine	PERSON	, which , though written before
Rod	PERSON	's death , serves well as an obituary tribute .

		The moral earnestness of his work is commended , while his skill and his charm as a story-teller are not lost sight of .

		Rod , concludes the essay , '' never tarries too long over psychological subtleties , never wearies us with lengthy descriptions , never loses sight of essen - tials in his care for detail .

		His aim is to depict character in its battle with realities ; individual life in its most sorrowful , most hidden , inner experience ; social existence as it envelopes and excites and crushes the individual .

		The framework of his novels is always solid , without being heavy ; the movement of the action is dramatic , without being breathless or capricious ; the form is severe and condensed , dispensing with false ornament .

		He writes calmly and deliberately , as one convinced of the truth of what he is saying .

		You feel that
Rod	PERSON	has lived long with his subject and his characters before put - ting them on paper . ''

Sanborn	PERSON	's estimate of the
Emerson Journals	ORGANIZATION	was delivered in no uncertain tones at a recent meeting of the
Emerson Society	ORGANIZATION	in the Bos - ton Public Library , where he read a paper on his illustrious fellow-townsman , paying especial atten - tion to the opening volumes of Journals and Letters that have recently appeared . ''

		The most important publication in
America	LOCATION	during the year just closed '' was his opinion of the work , because it displayed the youth and development of the greatest of American men of letters , and because for the first time it enabled his readers and critics to speak in - telligently of his early readings and meditations and all the influences promoting the growth of his genius .

		Going still further , Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	affirmed that '' the nearest approach that any American has made to the universality of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's mind is found in the wide reach and easy elevation of Emerson . ''

		The early maturity of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's thought and the wide range of his youthful studies were noted , as also his quick sense of affinity for
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, his skill , at eighteen , in turning the Spenserian stanza , and his facility in writing Latin .

		A significant utterance of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's was quoted in closing .

		When asked by
Elizabeth Peabody	ORGANIZATION	what effect it would have had on his education if his father had remained in the small rural parish of
Harvard	LOCATION	, where he first set - tled , he answered : '' Very little ; nature was there , and books . '' ''

		But how if your Aunt
Mary	PERSON	had not lived in your mother 's
Boston	LOCATION	family after your father 's death , and .

		concerned herself with your education ? '' ''

		Ah , that would have been a loss ; I could have better spared
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		The charm of mtths and superstitions , those graceful fabrications founded on poetry and romance and wonder , is so great that no amount of scientific and historic demonstration of their untenability will ever succeed in suppressing them .

		In vain does the ruthless myth-demolisher assure us that
Dick Whittington	PERSON	's cat is a fabulous animal , that
William Tell	PERSON	did not pierce the core of an apple with his arrow as the said fruit rested on the head of his little son , and that Lady Godiva never made that noonday pas - sage on horseback through the streets of
Coventry	LOCATION	, with only her golden tresses to veil her loveliness .

		Someone has tried to shiver to fragments
Cinderella	LOCATION	's dainty little glass slippers , by alleging that in the original Eastern version of the tale the footgear in question is of fur , and that our rendering of the French translation -LRB- pantoufles en vair -RRB- has stupidly given us glass slippers -LRB- pantoufles en verre -RRB- by a confusion of two French words pronounced nearly alike .

		To be sure , fur slippers would be more comfortable for dancing , unless we can imagine the spinning of glass to have attained perfection in
Cinderella	LOCATION	's time .

		But that is of small moment , and glass the slippers will remain for English-speaking children .

		Another baseless myth , if we are to believe the unsympathetic and unimaginative mete - orologist , lies behind the confident assertion of every adult inhabitant of
New England	LOCATION	, and perhaps of all our
Northern States	LOCATION	, that the winters of our boyhood were of a severity now unknown , and that Whit - tier 's 6 Snow-Bound '' pictures
December	DATE	rigors and delights not vouchsafed to this degenerate age .

		Mythoclasts , like iconoclasts , are an odious tribe ; and their destructive endeavors will little avail them .

		There may have been brave men before Agamemnon , but he will maintain his superiority to those that have come after him .


Minnesota	LOCATION	's contributions to literature are more considerable than one might expect from a
State	ORGANIZATION	still so young , and of so small a population compared with her older sisters .

		In '' Library Notes and News , '' issued by the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, there was published a year ago a list of
Minnesota	LOCATION	authors and their works , followed a few months later by large additions .

		A writer in the
December	DATE	number of the above-named publica - tion calls attention to the handsome showing of these combined lists , which give '' an enrollment of about four hundred

		About a hundred maga - zine writers are to be added to these , with some five hundred important articles to their credit .

		Count - ing also the many society publications and official documents from

State Histori	ORGANIZATION	- cal Society -- we have probably not fewer than a thousand names of writers and several thousand titles of books and pamphlets and articles and re - ports .

		Aggressive library methods -- aggressive in the sense of progressive -- are manifest in some sec - tions of the country , and in some libraries , and not so manifest in others .

		The never somnolent
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	makes active warfare on the non-reading and non-library-using members of its community .

		Thousands of copies of a rousing letter have been sent out by the librarian to persons in all walks of business life -- twenty-five hundred to rail - way employees alone .

		One of its paragraphs reads thus : '' This library has things which would be use - ful to you in your business .

		Anything it has n't now , and that may be of use to you , it will be glad to get and put at your service . ''

		That should prove irresistible .

		Supposing a recipient of this letter dis - covers that it would be useful to him in his business to have a copy of the '' Periegesis '' of
Pausanias	LOCATION	, or the '' De Re Rustica '' of
Varro	LOCATION	, or a new cash register of
Dayton	LOCATION	manufacture ; all he has to do is 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, to apply at the public library and the desired `` thing '' will be furnished at once , or , if already lent or not yet acquired , it will be procured as soon as possible .

		Truly , the public library 's range of usefulness is widened with the process of the suns .

		• * • A maker of future librarians has been found in the new director of the
Drexel Institute Library School	ORGANIZATION	at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, -- Miss
June Richardson Donnelly	PERSON	, apparently a not unworthy successor to the late
Alice B. Kroeger	PERSON	, whose bright , alert , and always cordially sympathetic personality will be remembered by all who knew her .

		A love of fun , too , was hers in full measure ; and her successor ,
Miss Donnelly	PERSON	, is said to be nowise deficient in humor .

		From '' Public Libraries '' we copy the fol - lowing personal paragraph , written by the director of
Simmons College Library School	ORGANIZATION	, where
Miss Donnelly	PERSON	is at present engaged : '' She is liked and respected by both the students and her fellow - instructors , for she has dignity , tact , and an interest in a variety of things , with the saving grace of a keen sense of humor .

		In the class-room Miss
Donnelly	PERSON	has been very successful .

		She presents her subjects logically , with a due sense of proportion , and in a clear , interesting manner . ''

		One is glad to read of the new Director , that with all her good qualities she has both humor and a sense of pro- portion -- which may save her pupils from the not unknown fate of taking themselves too seriously .

		• • • The crowded book-season , lately passed , but soon to begin again with the
spring	DATE	freshets , pre - sents so strong a contrast to the slack
summer	DATE	months , when the stream of literature trickles with the diminished volume of a mountain brook in Au - gust , that the thought must have occurred to many readers , Why not equalize the issue of books and make every season alike significant in the pro- duction of important works ?

		This alternation of dearth and superabundance has its obvious disad - vantages .

		A recent number of the
London	LOCATION	'' Athe - naeum '' -LRB- which , by the way , has at last , in its eighty - third year , added to the book reviews that have hitherto comprised its principal contents the desir - able feature of a leading article of general literary interest -RRB- advocates this more equal distribution of book-production throughout the four seasons .

		Book - publishers and book-reviewers certainly , and book - buyers and book-readers probably , would cast a majority vote for the reform .

		• • • The persistence of
Gladstone	LOCATION	's influence in
England	LOCATION	is attested , more convincingly than by any centennial eulogies , by the large sales of
Morley	PERSON	's life of the great statesman .

		From
London	LOCATION	comes the report that a hundred and thirty thousand copies of the book , in its three successive editions , ranging from two guineas to five shillings each , have been sold ; and the end is not yet .

		The length of the work -LRB- 800,000 words -RRB- and `` the nature of its contents make it no light undertaking to read it through , so that the record of its circulation becomes impressive indeed .

		Of course distinguished authorship counts for considerable , though probably for far less than in certain other departments of literature , as in fic - tion or poetry .

		But when all is said ,
Gladstone	PERSON	made on his countrymen , of whatever rank or station , an impression so deep and lasting that his biography will not soon cease to find willing pur - chasers and eager readers .

		The limit of Baconian madness has now been reached in the foolish enterprise of two Americans in exploring the caves at the foot of the cliffs on which stand the eleventh-century ruins of
Chepstow Castle	ORGANIZATION	, in
Monmouthshire	LOCATION	.

		Imagining they have found in
Bacon	LOCATION	's writings a clue to the hiding-place where his library was deposited , together with much documentary evidence to establish his authorship of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , and to upset Elizabethan his - tory generally , these enthusiastic Baconians have obtained exclusive rights -LRB- so it is reported -RRB- to the thorough searching of this mare 's nest ; and , though forced to suspend their fruitless labors for a time and return to this country , they declare their intention to return and resume the undertaking .

		As a piece of friendly counsel we would advise them to save their travelling expenses by digging and delving in their own cellars ; they would get the exercise and arrive at equally satisfying results .

Emerson	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	is still winning new ad - mirers .

		The latest proof of this takes the form of a French translation of his choicest passages for a vol - ume of '' Pages Choisies '' compiled by Mile .


Marie Dugard	PERSON	, the mistress of a young ladies ' `` Lycee '' at
Passy	LOCATION	.

		Mr.

Carlyle	PERSON	's cordial letter to his
Concord	LOCATION	friend , in which he hails the '' philosphy that hardly three men have dreamed of . ''

		Thus there are not wanting signs , both at home -LRB- where the `` Journals '' are now conspicuous in the book market -RRB- and abroad , that the Emersonian revival of seven years ago -LRB- the centennial year -RRB- did not exhaust the world 's enthusiasm for our great trans - cendentalism COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE CHARM OF INDIVIDUAL SPELLING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		A system of individual spelling -- '' every man for himself '' -- would seem to be the logical outcome of the '' spelling-reform '' movement ; but it is a little startling to find such a system openly advocated by a distinguished professor , who , if he is correctly reported , recently told
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 the students of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	that '' Much would be achieved if scholars of renown , philologists , students of literature , and writers of books in general , would indulge in some individual spellings .

		These need not be necessarily consistent , and the author need not give any other reason for his special heterodoxies than that they just suit his fancy . ''

		That men are to be found who are ready to live up to these counsels of literary anarchy , appears from some charming sentences culled from an address by one who is described as '' a professor in one of our technical schools '' : ''
Liv	PERSON	for the realization of hy ideals . '

		• He shoud hav abstaind from reviling 1 the faricees .

		• • A man brings out ... quaint litl pearls in her soul that she herself never dremt of .

		`` So are man 's enrage and generosity dubld and tripld thru a woman 's presence . ''

		As a writer in '' The Nation '' lately pointed out , '' one natural result of the agitation in favor of so-called ' simplified spelling ' would be a tendency , on the part of the careless , inaccurate , and anarchical , to be more lawless , inaccurate , and indifferent still as to spelling in general .

		Such a tendency would be shown in many places , one of them obviously being the classroom . ''

		A timely illustration of the way the tendency is shown in classrooms comes from
Iowa	LOCATION	, where a college pro- fessor has compiled from examination papers of his students a list of 160 misspelled words .

		Presumably , these counted against the students in their markings .

		But why should they ?

		Why should not students , as well as professors , exercise the right -- the duty , even -- of '' individual spelling '' ?

		This is a free country , and a student has as much right as anyone else to use spell - ings that '' just suit his fancy . ''

		THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE MALONE SOCIETY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		It will be of interest , I think , to many of your readers to know that the
Malone Society	ORGANIZATION	, of
England	LOCATION	, intends to close its subscription list on
March 20	DATE	, and that all who wish to become members of the Society and secure the valuable publications which it is issuing must apply before that date to the Honorary Secretary of the Society ,
Arundel Esdaile	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, The British Museum ,
London	LOCATION	.

		The Society was founded for the purpose of printing texts of early English plays , and documents and notes illustrative of the history of the English stage and drama .

		During the first two years of its existence it issued twelve volumes , ten plays , and two volumes of collections consisting of fragments of plays and valuable documents and notes ; and a further set of six volumes is in preparation for the current year .

		As the Society was not organized for profit , but for the benefit of the members , the number of volumes issued will depend upon the funds available from membership fees .

		It has now 215 members , and should have many more , as the annual subscription is only one guinea .

		The plays are not facsimiles , but exact reprints of the originals , executed under the supervision of Mr.
W. W. Greg	PERSON	as general editor , whose name , with those of
E. K. Chambers	PERSON	, the President of the Society , and
A. W. Pollard	PERSON	, the Honorary Treasurer , will assure those who have not seen the volumes of the scholarly accuracy with which the reprints are made .

		The com - position and press-work has been done by the
Chiswick Press	ORGANIZATION	and the Clarendon Press , and the volumes are notably fine examples of bookmaking .

		All persons who are interested in the history of the drama in
England	LOCATION	should avail themselves of the opportunity to become members of the Society before the subscription list is closed .

		As the time is short , I shall be glad to answer any questions which intending subscribers may wish to ask in regard to the Society .

		A NOTE ON SHELLEY 'S `` ADONAIS . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I believe that it has not been pointed out that the famous lines in the last stanza of '' Adonais , '' -- '' My spirit 's bark is driven Far from the shore , far from the trembling throng Whose sails were never to the tempest given ; The massy earth and sphered skies are riven !

		I am borne darkly , fearfully , afar , '' -- find an interesting parallel in the dying words of
Vittoria	LOCATION	in
Webster	PERSON	's '' White Devil , '' -- '' My soul , like to a ship in a black storm , Is driven I know not whither . ''

		It is probable that the parallelism is accidental , though
Shelley	PERSON	at the time -LRB-
1821	DATE	-RRB- was still revising `` The Cenci '' -LRB- 1820 ; second edition ,
1821	DATE	-RRB- .

		In this drama , as is well known , he drew largely on the Elizabethan plays for models .

		Both the passages cited , from '' Adonais '' and '' The White Devti , '' are also interesting because they are modifications of one of the most frequently used conceits of the sonneteers .

		Petrarch -LRB- `` Vita , '' exxxvii . -RRB-

		wrote : ''
Passa	PERSON	la nave mia colma d' obblio Per aspro mare a mezza notte il verno ... Tal ch ' incomincio a disperar del porto . ''

		Of the many imitations of this figure in the Elizabethan sonnet cycles ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's -LRB- `` Amoretti , '' xxxiv . -RRB-

		fits most nearly the present case : ''
Lyke	PERSON	as a ship , that through the Ocean wyde , By conduct of some star , doth make her way ; Whenas a storme hath dim 'd her trusty guyde , Out of her course doth wander far astray !

		So I , whose star , that wont with her bright ray Me to direct , with cloudes is overcast ,
Doe	PERSON	wander now , in darknesse and dismay , Through hidden perils round about me plast ; Yet hope I well that , when this storme is past , My Helice , the lodestar of my lyfe , Will shine again , and looke on me at last . ''

		The complaint of Britomart -LRB- F. Q. LEI. , iv. , 8 and 9 -RRB- is a free adaptation of the same idea , and the parallel in '' Adonais '' is made the more striking by the concluding thought that '' The soul of Adonais , like a star , Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are . ''

		In one of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's letters to Mrs.
Gisborne	LOCATION	, dated from
Florence	LOCATION	,
November , 1819	DATE	, there is still another echo of the familiar Elizabethan conceit : '' Madonna -- I have been lately voyaging in a sea without my pilot , and although my sail has often been torn , my boat become leaky , and the log lost , I have yet sailed in a kind of way from island to island .

		... I have been reading

		The
Authorized Biography of Richard Manseieed	ORGANIZATION	.

		* '' I am your dramatic godson , '' said
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	to his friend of twenty-five years ' standing , Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	. ''

		I wonder if you would care to undertake a biography ?

		It might interest some persons , and much in my early life was strange .

		It should prove inter - esting .

		I think a book on the
Life of R. M.	ORGANIZATION	, from your pen , might sell well . ''

		And later , after being told that the book was planned and would be written : ** I am tremendously excited about your writing the
Life of R. M	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is better than being knighted . ''

		Now at last , after the lapse of two years and a half since the brilliant actor 's untimely death , appears Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's '' Life and Art of Rich - ard
Mansfield	PERSON	, '' in two handsome and profusely - illustrated volumes .

		The long intimacy between the two men , the younger one 's constant practice of seeking the advice and encouragement of his '' dramatic godfather , '' their mutual sympathy in many of their ideals and enthusiasms , and the records , largely in the form of personal letters , in the biographer 's possession , qualify him to write informingly and authoritatively of his actor-friend , and to correct many false notions about him that have been circulated by other pens -- notably by that of Mr.
Paul Wilstach	PERSON	, whose highly readable book , ''
Richard Mans	PERSON	- field , the Man and the Actor , '' has now been before the public for more than a year .


Espe	PERSON	- cially unaccountable , in the light of Mr.
Win	PERSON	- ter 's volumes , is the other 's assertion -LRB- at the end of the preface to his book -RRB- that '' his -LSB- i. e. ,
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	's | letters , which would add to an acquaintance with him , were not many , except to his wife and son .

		To others he wrote in the main only brief notes of courtesy , for he had an aversion to telling anyone what he was go - ing to do , or to referring to what he had done . ''

		On the contrary , as shown by the many letters now reproduced , he was , if anything , too ready to enlarge , in grandiloquent fashion , on his own unparalleled achievements , past and prospective .

		For example , in an exultant outpouring to Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, he writes , in the
spring of 1890	DATE	: '' I think everything is possible to me , if I am helped , and I feel , more and more , that the future -- the imme - diate future -- of the American stage lies very much in my hands .

		At all events , I intend laying violent hands * Life and Art of

		on it -- coute que coute !

		I have a most tempting offer to go to
Berlin	LOCATION	; and I think I shall accept -- because I can go there and do great things ' right off , ' without question -- and when I 've done them there it will appear natural to people here that I should do them . ''

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	is so much interested in the art of
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	that he dwells very slightly on his life , apart from his movements in the pursuit of that fame which he so confidently expected to win .

		The early years in
England	LOCATION	and on the Continent are barely referred to ; but one question of some importance is decisively settled , and that is the birth-year of the preco - cious young man who startled theatrical circles in
New York	LOCATION	with his impersonation of
Baron Chevrial	PERSON	in
1883	DATE	.

		The commonly accepted date of his birth -- the date , too , that is given in Mr.
Wilstach	PERSON	's book -- would make him but twenty - five years old at that time ; whereas , from his own written words , cited by Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, it appears that he was in his twenty-ninth year , having been born in
1854	DATE	.

		The first volume of the '' Life and Art '' follows
Mansfield	PERSON	through the rapidly alternating vicissitudes of good and evil fortune , down to his death in the late
summer of 1907	DATE	; and , though much inci - dental comment and criticism are interspersed , the greater part of this sort of disquisition is reserved for the second volume , where each im - portant role of the versatile actor is taken up in proper order and treated in the well-known man - ner of the veteran dramatic critic , and certainly without undue prejudice in the performer 's favor .

		The writer earnestly disclaims ever hav - ing allowed any favor of persons to influence his judgment or modify its candid expression .

		Son of an English father and a Russian mother -LRB- the
Madame Erminia Rudersdorff	PERSON	of operatic fame -RRB- ,
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	was so richly endowed with the artistic and bohemian tem - perament that anything like a peaceable , well - ordered , commonplace boyhood and youth was from the very outset an impossibility .

		His peculiar gift for misfitting his environment is reflected in some notes of his early life , written for Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's use .

		He says , probably with considerable artistic intensifying of lights and shadows , especially of shadows : '' Mine was a hard life when I was a child .

		Some - times I was scolded , sometimes beaten , and sometimes starved .

		Whatever I was meant to be , God knows it is not strange if I am what they call ` singular . '

		I sometimes think that the early wrench given to my mind by such treatment was the beginning of the sym - pathy I feel with such persons as Glo ` ster and
Chevrial	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are wicked , but they are courageous ; they have seen the selfishness of the world , -- and they go on .

		What they get they compel ; the recognition they receive is for what they do for themselves ; they are always
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 lonely ; they look through the motives of all around them , and no wonder they are cynical and cruel .

		There are times when I feel so barred out of the world , so hated , that if I could push down the pillars of the universe and smash everything and everybody , I 'd gladly do it ! ''

		That one of so rebellious and stormy a dis - position , prone to regard the world as his enemy until friendship had been extorted by violence , should not have been loved by the public , even though the tribute of admiration could not be withheld , is not strange .

		It was a part of his character , and one of his methods of making his way in his difficult profession , to be aggressive and dictatorial , intolerant of stupidity and im - patient of restraint .

		Macready ,
Forrest	LOCATION	,
Kean	PERSON	, and scores of prominent actors and actresses besides , could be adduced as examples of this high-strung , uncompromising artistic tempera - ment .

		From the outset he seems to have been unable to work in harmony with associates , or on an equal footing with them .

		Whatever his part , he tended to fill the stage ; and there was no peace for him or anyone else until he had put himself at the head of a company and won the right to '' boss the show . ''

		Wherever he sat was the head of the table -- literally as well as figuratively , his uneasiness as a guest at another 's board being notorious .

		Even with a professional rival so friendly and appreciative as Henry Irving he could not manage to remain on thoroughly good terms for any length of time .

		When he went to
England	LOCATION	, in
1888	DATE	, at living 's invitation and with the Lyceum placed at his disposal , it was not long before he imag - ined himself ill-treated by all and sundry with whom he came in contact .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	writes : '' The meeting was a delightful one .

		The relations between
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	and Irving were then friendly .

		They did not always remain so .

		They fluctuated considerably ; and although , at the last , the two men remained on osten - sibly amicable terms of social intercourse , the feeling existent between them was that of disapprobation on the part of Irving and antipathy on the part of
Mansfield	LOCATION	.

		It is necessary to allude to this subject , because those actors , eventually , became professionally opposed , and because circumstances in the stage career of
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	would otherwise remain unexplained .

		The subject , fur - thermore , is an essential part of theatrical history , -- a record which should tell the truth , and not be encum - bered with sentimental eulogium and obscuration of facts .

		Mansfield had no reason to blame any one but himself for the loss of
Henry Irving	ORGANIZATION	's active friendship .

		It was an infirmity of his mind that he ascribed every mishap , every untoward circumstance , every reverse of fortune , to some external , malign influence , -- never to any accident , or any error of his judgment , or any ill - considered act or word , or any fault of his own . ''

		It should be remembered , in connection with
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	's professional struggles and rivalries , that he appeared on the stage at a time when many actors of rare ability were vying for pub - lic favor , both in
America	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	.

Langtry	PERSON	,
Wilson Barrett	PERSON	,
Charles Wyndham	PERSON	, and others that the reader will recall , need but to be run over to make impressive enough the formidable character of the competition which
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	had to encounter on the English - speaking stage .

		He always regarded it as the mistake of his life that he began his dramatic course in this country rather than in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Among the carefully studied criticisms -LRB- in volume two -RRB- of
Mansfield	LOCATION	's various impersona - tions , that of Richard the Third , his most nota - ble achievement , is especially worth reading . ''

		The value of
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	's performance of Richard '' says the author in one place , '' did not consist in theories or innovations , but in a tremendous concentration of intellectual force and passionate feeling , expressed with many fine touches of dramatic art , resultant in a life - like image , terrific and piteous , of grisly wick - edness and retributive misery . ''

		In a more general and comprehensive estimate of Mans - field 's gifts , the author well says : '' In faculty of impersonation he was extraordinary , and in that respect he has seldom been equalled , in our time ; but , because of the inevitable appearance of pecu - liarities in all bis embodiments , the merit of versatility has often been denied to him : yet he displayed the ability , and had the fortune , to distinguish himself in almost every branch of the dramatic art , -- in comic opera , farce , and burlesque , light comedy , romantic drama , melodrama , and tragedy .

		The student , remem - bering
Mansfield	PERSON	, and musmg upon the many vagaries of opinion that are or have been current about bis act - ing , might advantageously consider the astonishing grasp of diversified character and the wide and easy command of expressive art that he exhibited , during the twenty-four years of his industrious , laborious , and remarkable career . ''

		A forty-three-page '' Chronology , '' valuable to the historian of the drama , is appended ; also an interesting twelve-page '' Note on • Beau Brummell ' '' ; and a '' Note on the Gentle Art of Plagiarism , '' for the benefit of
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	's earlier biographer .

		An index of twenty-six pages concludes the work .

		The many portraits , chiefly of
Mansfield	ORGANIZATION	in his various characters as actor , are of unusual interest as a striking evi - dence of his versatility .

		The whole work is one of irresistible appeal to the lover of the stage , and with its marks of painstaking workmanship -LRB- it was begun in
1905	DATE	-RRB- it forms one of the ripest and best of its author 's many books on kindred themes .

Feb. 16	DATE	, Ox the
Wrong Tracks of Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Only occasionally is a piece of contemporary Italian literature translated into English and published in an English-speaking country .

		When so large and serious a work as Sera 's '' On the Tracks of Life '' is accorded this extension of its sphere of influence , the event arouses more than ordinary curiosity as to the character and content of the book .

		This curiosity is not abated , to say the least , when it finds such a phrase as `` The Immorality of Morality '' used as a sub-title .

		Examination of the book develops the fact that this sub-title really strikes the keynote of the whole work , though perhaps not in just the manner intended by the author . ''

		The Immorality of Morality '' implies a paradox .

		The whole book is as para - doxical as this phrase .

		Think for a moment of some proposition that the common every-day experience of mankind has demonstrated to be not true .

		Then open Sera 's book at random , read a page or so , and it is rather better than an even chance that you will find that identical proposition set forth as a great and fundamental truth .

		Thus , to take but a single instance : normal right-minded people as a result of then - knowledge of history and observation of contem - porary society are inclined to regard such things as idleness and sexual dissipation , for example , as undesirable modes of human activity , -- to put the case as mildly as may be .

		But Sera devotes pages to the discussion of the `` degrading in - fluence of work '' and to statements like the following : `` The types of activity which our morality more or less explicitly condemns -LRB- aristocratic tendencies , sexual and economic dissipation -RRB- -- -LSB- query : does he mean '' high finance '' ? -RSB-

		-- have , in my opinion , a very high function for the race , and render possible the propagation and continuation of human society which would otherwise , from many deteriorating causes , die out . ''

		The sentence just quoted states essentially the thesis of the whole book .

		Whatever is aristocratic is good , or rather is best -- the summum bonum of human endeavor .

		The more vicious and anti-social the aristocratic ten - dency , the more valuable and beautiful is it con - sidered by Sera to be .

		The first chapter of the book deals with '' Love . ''

		It puts forward as the highest ideal not even '' free love '' as advo - cated by some social philosophers , but rather in - * On the Tracks of Life .

		The
Immorality of Morality	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated from the Italian of
Leo G. Sera	PERSON	by
J. M. Kennedy	PERSON	, with an Introduction by Dr.
Oscar Levy	PERSON
New York	LOCATION	: The
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		discriminate sexual dissipation and debauchery ; '' the exaltation , the raving , the delirium of the agony of the love of a former time : a strong , undefined , promiscuous , free , and serene love . ''

		The utter perversity of the author 's conclu - sions is nowhere more clearly illustrated than in the following summary of his views : '' The aristocratic ideal , in its triple aspiration towards leisure , power , and love , is manifested as a per - petual struggle towards natural conditions of life ; a healthy , strong and vigorous nature ; pure animalness .

		The existence of this ideal is seen to be antagonistic to sociality and morality , which both make for the impoverishment , the organic degradation of the species man ... The ultimate aim of every form of social activity is animal leisure . ''

		The reasoning that leads to these conclu - sions , which from the standpoint of plain common-sense can only be characterized as silly , involves a kind of error from which the lucu - brations of more profound biologists than Sera are not always free .

		This is the error of at - tempting to '' explain '' that which is objectively clear and known , in terms of that which is mys - terious , obscure , and unknown or unknowable .

		The plain facts of social evolution are that man - kind for a very long time has been , and still is , moving steadily away from such aristocratic ideals as are enumerated by Sera , toward those of democracy and socialism .

		Only by the attempting to '' explain '' these obvious facts in terms of unknown motives and feelings can they become so perverted and obscured as they are in the work under review .

		The book is fortified , as it were , at both its points of entrance and exit , by a militant Intro - duction on the one hand , and a positively anni - hilating Appendix on the other hand .

		In both of these places any who might be inclined to criticize are warned off the premises in no uncer - tain terms .

		In the Introduction -LRB- by Dr.
Oscar Levy	PERSON	-RRB- we are told that '' there is gradually but surely forming itself in all countries a superior class of men , who , observing the gulf between them and their fellow-men , very soon give up the idea of enlightening the unenlightables , and over the frontiers of their countries heartily shake hands with each other . ''


Signor Sera	PERSON	, we are specifically told , is one of those '' superior '' gentlemen : those who do not agree with him are of the `` unenlightables . ''

		The calm and temperate spirit in which the author himself meets criticism is indicated in the following remarks in the Appendix : '' However , as criti - cisms become poorer and poorer , and at last , as
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 often happens , even the minor reviewers began to think that my silence was due to lack of grounds for objecting to their criticisms , and raised their perky little heads like young cocks with crests not yet full-grown , which nevertheless imagine themselves to be kings of their coops , I decided that the moment had come when matters should be put right . ''

		Altogether , it is to be expected that this great effort of Sera 's will , as is predicted by implica - tion in the Introduction , fail to enlighten the '' unenlightables . ''

		One ventures to think , how - ever , that the primary difficulty is , on the whole , with the source of illumination rather than with the photo-receptivity of the average reader .


Raymond Pearl	PERSON	.

		Shakespeare as
Neuropath axd Lover	ORGANIZATION	.

		* At last
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	stands revealed to us !

		It is nearly three hundred years since he died , yet it is only now that we have '' his tragic life - story . ''

		It is almost as if a new play , a greater than `` Hamlet , '' had been discovered .

		And the amazing thing is that one had only to read Shakespeare to see the man , the lover , the ruined life , all as plain as words can make them .

		This is what amazes Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	, too , who in his modesty is forced to assume superiority to the hordes of Shakespearian critics who saw not the light .

		Only Goethe and
Coleridge	PERSON	got glimpses , which , however , led no whither ; all the rest , and their '' tons of talk , '' are far astray .

		This book of Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's would show that Shakespeare painted himself not once but twenty times .

		The character that is preemi - nently
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is Hamlet ; and whenever
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in delineating other characters , grew careless , as he very frequently did , he dropped into Hamlet , -- that is , he depicted himself .

		Some characters are merely Hamlet in other circumstances .

		Romeo is Hamlet in love , as
Hazlitt	PERSON	had already remarked ; Jaques is Hamlet in melancholy discontent .

		Thus , '' if we combine the character of Romeo , the poet - lover , and Jaques , the pensive-eyed philosopher , we have almost the complete Hamlet . ''

		As Mr.
Harris	PERSON	frequently remarks , '' Think of it ! ''

		These three characters we may therefore re - gard as Shakespeare prepense .

		The real task is to find the unconscious Shakespeares .

		And from the wealth of choice let us take -- oh , anyone will do -- say
Macbeth	LOCATION	.

		Like Hamlet , * The
Max Shakespeare	PERSON	axd His Tragic Life-Story .

		By
Frank Harris	PERSON	.

		New York :
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		Macbeth weighs the pro and con of action to fulfil the witches ' prophesies ; he is courteous in his address -- calling
Banquo	PERSON	and the others '' kind gentlemen '' ; he is '' too full of the milk of human kindness '' ; he is irresolute when it comes to murdering
Duncan	PERSON	; he has Hamlet 's `` peculiar and exquisite intellectual fairness , '' and remarks that '' this
Duncan	PERSON	hath borne his faculties so meek , '' etc. ; he is the mouthpiece of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` marvellous lyrical faculty '' ; he has a religious tinge in his nature -- `` But wherefore , '' he says , '' could not I pronounce 4 Amen , ' '' and Hamlet exclaims , '' Angels and ministers of grace defend us , '' and later , `` I 'll go pray . '' ''

		This new trait , '' remarks Mr.
Harris	PERSON	, '' most intimate and distinctive , is there - fore the most conclusive proof of the identity of the two characters . ''

		Could the most skeptical dryasdust professor -- Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's bete noir -- demand more ?

		But in case he should , here it is : After the strain of the murder ,
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	loses his nerve . ''

		All this is exquisitely char - acteristic of the nervous student who has been screwed up to a feat beyond his strength , * a terrible feat , ' and who has broken down over it ; but his words are altogether absurd in the mouth of an ambitious half - barbarous chieftain . ''

		Yet , strange as it may seem , Hamlet managed to bear up after he had murdered Polonius and sent
Rosencrantz	PERSON	and Guildenstern to the final surprise of their lives .

		But after the second act , Macbeth seems to be able to do things more or less bloody .

		How account for the change ?

		In the first part ,
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	is Shakespeare -- `` gentle , bookish , and irresolute '' ; in the latter part , where the dramatist has to follow
Holinshed	PERSON	and set Macbeth to murdering , he yet '' did not think of lending Macbeth any tinge of cruelty , harshness , or ambition .

		His Macbeth commits murder for the same reason that the timorous deer fights -- out of fear . ''

		This shows how kind
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was !

		The same quality is further shown in
Macbeth	LOCATION	's unwillingness to fight
Macduff	PERSON	in their final meeting , in his confession of `` pity and remorse , which must be compared to the gentle-kindness with which Hamlet treats
Laertes	ORGANIZATION	and Romeo treats
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		Anyone must now be convinced of the identity of these characters !

		In somewhat similar fashion we are taught that Duke Vincentio in '' Measure for Measure '' and Posthumus in '' Cymbeline '' are
Hamlet	LOCATION	-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		So Arthur in ''
King John	PERSON	, '' and
Richard II.	PERSON	, are after the same model .

		In the case of the latter there is a difference be - tween his character in the early part of the play 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, and that in the later .

		In the former case he is selfish , greedy , cruel ; in the second he is all that is lovable .

		Why ?

		Because in the first part Shakespeare is following history ; in the second , he is drawing himself .

		Would the same reasoning apply to Edward II .

		in Mar - lowe 's play ?

		From these delineations of character Mr.
Harris	PERSON	shows that ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's nature , even in hot , reckless youth , was most feminine and affectionate , and that ... he preferred to pic - ture irresolution and weakness rather than strength . ''

		If you do n't believe it , look at Hotspur .

		When he is brusque , blame
Holin	PERSON	- shed ; when he talks about '' gentle Severn 's sedgy bank , '' he is Shakespeare , -- such lan - guage is too poetical for Hotspur .

		Again , it is beyond Shakespeare to present courage in Hot - spur or in anyone .

		And yet we seem to have heard these lines : '' Send Danger from the east unto the west , So Honour cross it from the north or south , And let them grapple .

		O , the blood more stirs To rouse a lion than to start a hare ! ''

		So , too , he can not present Prince
Hal	PERSON	as pos - sessing manly virtues .

		He is not much more than a weak imitation of Hotspur .

		Moreover , we learn from
Poins	LOCATION	that he is lewd , -- and , as a remarkable coincidence , so are Jaques -LRB- or so the Duke says -RRB- , and
Vincentio	PERSON	-LRB- for does not Lucio say so ? -RRB-

		; therefore
Shakespeare	PERSON	was lewd , he was a sensualist .

		The character of the Prince as here expounded explains the vexed question of the rejection of Falstaff .

		Shakespeare too had spent time in bad company , and '' like other weak men was filled with a desire to throw the blame on his ' misleaders . '

		He certainly ex - ulted in their punishment . ''

		How Professor
Bradley	PERSON	's attempt at a solution hides its dimin - ished head before the convincing simplicity of this brilliant discovery !

		But Professor
Brad	PERSON	- ley is a Dryasdust , and not a revealer .

		This
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	cuts a pretty poor figure !

		He has no virile virtues or vices , no desperate courage , only '' a love of honour working on quick gen - erous blood '' ; no '' cruelty , hatred , ambition , revenge , '' the ancillary qualities of courage .

		And yet it seems to us that there is some cruelty depicted in ''
Lear	PERSON	, '' some hatred and revenge in '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' and some ambi - tion in ''
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		But no , '' manliness was not his -LSB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's -RSB- forte ; he was by nature a neuropath and a lover . ''

		A few more aspects remain .

		Orsino , in '' Twelfth Night , '' the lover of music and flowers and passion , is Shakespeare . ''

		Shakespeare lends no music to his villains '' -- Iago and his song , '' And let me the canakin clink , clink , '' to the contrary notwithstanding .

		Shakespeare had a sense of humor , we are pleased to learn , for we would see in this a masculine trait .

		So we take much comfort out of Falstaff .

		But this staff is a broken reed .

		Not even
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was great enough to create Falstaff ; he must have had a model , and that model was probably
Chettle	PERSON	!

		Why ?

		Because Falstaff surpasses all of Shake - speare 's other comic characters ; because he de - picted Falstaff so poorly in the `` Merry Wives '' that he must have depended on his model whom he had already exhausted in '' Henry IV . ''

		; and because
Chettle	PERSON	was a jovial soul !

		But now we come to the actual events of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life , which we glean from the Sonnets and some of the plays . ''

		W. H. , '' we are to accept without question , is
William Herbert	PERSON	,
Earl	PERSON	of
Pembroke	LOCATION	; and the '' dark lady '' is
Mary Fitton	PERSON	.

		There is no doubt about it . ''

		The story is very simple : Shake - speare loved Mistress
Fitton	PERSON	, and sent his friend , the young Lord
Herbert	PERSON	, to her on some pretext , but with the design that he should commend
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to the lady .

		Mistress
Fitton	PERSON	fell in love with
William Herbert	PERSON	, wooed and won him , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had to mourn the loss of both friend and mistress . ''

		More - over , this story has been treated three times in the plays -- in '' Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, '' '' Much Ado , '' and '' Twelfth Night '' ; yet no one has noticed it . ''

		If after these three recitals , '' Mr.
Harris	PERSON	says , '' anyone can still believe the sonnet-story is imaginary , he is beyond per - suasion by argument . ''

		Now this
Mary Fitton	PERSON	has already appeared in the plays , for we can recognize her by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's very careful descriptions .

		She is Rosaline in ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' as well as the girl of the same name in '' Love 's Labour 's Lost . ''

		In all cases we have dark hair , dark eyes , pale complexion .

		All would fit in so nicely with
Mary Fitton	PERSON	, were it not that
Mistress Mary	ORGANIZATION	, we know from authentic portraits , was a blonde beauty !

		But let that go .

		This
Mary Fitton	PERSON	he loved with an intense passion ; but towards the traitor Herbert he expresses no anger , since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	dearly loved a lord .

		He was an arrant snob , like all your English .

		And thus
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, for twelve mortal years from
1597	DATE	to
1608	DATE	, suffered such agonies as only a genius and a disappointed sensualist can endure .

		The fruit of this agony we have in the plays , -- so let us be thankful that poor gentle
Shakespeare	PERSON	had a sad and weary lot .

		It is
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 accordingly not
Brutus	PERSON	, but
Shakespeare	PERSON	, who , '' racked by love and jealousy , tortured by be - trayal , was at war with himself . ''

		Like Hamlet , he was prompted to his revenge by heaven and hell , but he was too gentle and kind to act it out .

		Rosencrantz and Guildenstern did not report their opinion of Hamlet 's farewell kind - ness .

		All Hamlet 's unreasoning rage at his mother 's lechery is Shakespeare telling
Mary Fitton	PERSON	what he thinks of her . ''

		If anyone can imagine that this is the way a son thinks of a mother 's slip , '' sadly comments our author , `` he is past my persuading . ''

		Past , long past !

		How simple the complex problem of '' Hamlet '' be - comes in the light of these revelations !

		Othello 's jealous fury against
Desdemona	ORGANIZATION	merges into
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's wrath towards
Mary Fitton	PERSON	.

		Desdemona never showed '' high and plenteous wit and invention , '' but
Mary	PERSON	did , alas , too much !

		A still closer portrait of Mistress Fit - ton we get in
Cressida	LOCATION	; and , what is equally interesting , we learn that
Shakespeare	PERSON	wrote this '' wretched invertebrate play , '' this libel on
Greece	LOCATION	, to mock
Chapman	PERSON	, the rival poet of the Sonnets .

		Ignorant of Greek , he poured con - tempt on it and on
Chapman	PERSON	. ''

		This estab - lishes the opinion that
Chapman	PERSON	was indeed the rival poet . ''

		Reasoning can no farther go !

		As we might guess -LRB- provided we are not professors , like
Dowden	PERSON	and
Gollancz	PERSON	-RRB- , Cleopatra is
Mary Fitton	PERSON	, and
Antony	ORGANIZATION	is Shakespeare .

		The inter - view between Thyreus and Cleopatra was writ - ten '' out of wounded personal feeling , '' to show up the fickle
Mary	PERSON	.

		She does n't mind it , now that the discovery has just been made , -- but she wrecked
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life . ''

		Hamlet in love with
Cleopatra	LOCATION	, the poet lost in desire of the wanton , -- that is the tragedy of Shake - speare 's life . '' '

		His passion led him to '' shame and madness and despair ; his strength broke down under the strain , and he never won back again to health . ''

		Lear expresses his own dis - illusion and naked misery ; it is the first attempt in all literature to paint madness , Mr.
Harris	PERSON	informs us .

		We receive the news with fitting modesty . ''

		Timon '' is merely '' a scream of pain '' closing the agony .

		After all this ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	went to
Stratford	LOCATION	to recuperate under the care of his daughter : Mr.
Harris	PERSON	tells us so .

		Then came the Romances , '' all copies '' ; Shakespeare was '' too tired to invent or even to annex . ''

		Prospero is Shake - speare ; and so is
Ariel	LOCATION	, who was imprisoned painfully for a dozen years to a foul witch , -- to whom , indeed , but
Mary Fitton	PERSON	?

		The close of this veracious history is occupied with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' Life , '' which incorporates , as credible , stories ranging from
Audrey	ORGANIZATION	's ac - count of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's killing a calf in high style and making a speech , to his parentage of D'Avenant .

		A fitting close to the romance .

		It is interesting to note that the book , which contains such violent diatribes on the English aristocracy as would have made good Radical campaign literature in the recent elections , is dedicated to an English peer .

		A fitting begin - ning to the romance .

		James
W. Tupper	PERSON	.

		The Age of Waterways .

		* '' It will require the best thought and best effort of this generation , '' wrote Mr.
Hill	PERSON	to the late Governor
Johnson	PERSON	of
Minnesota	LOCATION	, '' to avert the evil that now casts its shadow upon the farmer , manufacturer , and merchant , to arrest the progress of the paralysis that is laying its grip upon the heart of commerce , and to restore the wholesome circulation without which there can not be life and growth in either individual or the commonwealth . ''

		Mr.
Herbert Quick	PERSON	, author of a recent work on '' American Inland Waterways , '' sees but one way out of this diffi - culty , and that is in the development of our great continental waterways so as to enable them to perform their proper economic share of the work of transportation .

		`` It is a great task , '' he says , `` but it is quite within our power ; and the waterways can do the work completely , which the railways never can .

		The natural expense of land carriage is high , and the capacity of railways is strictly limited .

		The capacity of a waterway like the new
Erie Canal	ORGANIZATION	is equal to a dozen railways .

		The capacity of a deep waterway down the
Mississippi	LOCATION	is almost incalculable ; but it is entirely safe to say that no conceivable tonnage derived from the Mis - sissippi Valley and
Lake Basin	LOCATION	could tax its carrying power .

		... In efficiency , the water - ways leave nothing to be desired as a remedy for our transportation ills . ''

		Mr.
Quick	PERSON	proceeds to discuss the advantages of waterways on the score of economy , and makes out an exceedingly strong case for them .

		His book is , in fact , an admirably clear and full presentation of a subject that is already looming large on the national horizon , and bids fair to be of paramount importance to the peo - • Amkbican Inland Waterways .

		Their Relation to
Railway Transportation	ORGANIZATION	and the
National Welfare	ORGANIZATION	; their Creation , Restoration , and Maintenance .

G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, pie of
America	LOCATION	.

		He has brought together , in clear and readable shape , a mass of material bearing not only on the question of inland water - ways , but also on the closely related subjects of the conservation of forests and streams , and the generation of water-powers , with their relation to the great problems of power , heat , light , coal resources , and the conservation of mechanical efficiency arising therefrom .

		Mr.
Quick	PERSON	has succeeded well in his attempt to convey , in terms capable of comprehension by the average citizen , the scientific knowledge of the subject as embodied in such recent documents as the Preliminary Report of the
Inland Waterways Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the Report of the
Chicago Harbor Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		He goes somewhat fully into a discussion of the efforts that have already been made by the government to improve the rivers and harbors of the
United States	LOCATION	, -- efforts which aggregate a cost of
$ 500,000,000	MONEY	, and yet mark but the beginning of what may be accomplished in the direction of the devel - opment of the inland waterways of the country .

		The trouble has been , as in so many other public undertakings here and elsewhere , that the work of improvement has been haphazard and lacking in system .

		One of the principal objects of the
Newlands	LOCATION	bill in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was to bring together all these scattered efforts and mould and enlarge them into a comprehensive scheme of waterways which would ultimately embrace every important river and lake in the
United States	LOCATION	, the rivers to be connected by canals , following in most cases the old portage paths of Indian and fur-trader , and by coastal canals connecting tidal lakes , bays , sounds , and river mouths , like the one proposed for naviga - tion from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Florida	LOCATION	and from
Florida	LOCATION	to the Texan ports .

		This remarkable bill , on which Mr.
Quick	PERSON	bases many of his arguments , is not the project of a dreamer , but rather the measure of a practical statesman , and repre - sents to a large extent the ideas of such men as Mr.
Pinchot	PERSON	, late head of the
Forest Service	ORGANIZATION	, of
Marshall O. Leighton	PERSON	of the
Water Resources Branch of the Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	, of Director
Newell	PERSON	of the
Reclamation Service	ORGANIZATION	, of Dr.
Mc	PERSON	- Gee the erosion expert , of Secretary
Wilson	PERSON	, and of Ex-President
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		It is designed not merely to promote transportation on inland waterways , by vessels of a standard draught , but also '' to consider and coordinate the ques tions of irrigation , swamp-land reformation , clarification of streams , utilization of water - power , prevention of soil waste , protection of forests , regulation of flow , control of floods , '' and the innumerable other questions arising from or connected with the great subject of the conservation of our natural resources .

		The waterway to which Mr. Quick devotes most attention is the Lakes-to-the-Gulf project , as to the vital importance of which he brings together a convincing array of facts and figures ; nor does he neglect the important projects undertaken or contemplated by
Canada	LOCATION	to im - prove her inland waterways .

		It is not to be wondered at that in discussing the larger aspects of the question Mr.
Quick	PERSON	rises to a degree of enthusiasm .

		With the facts in his mind and a map of
North America	LOCATION	spread before him , any man may quickly convince himself of the tre - mendous potentialities of our inland waterways , and incidentally of the unique strategic posi - tions held by
Chicago	LOCATION	-- and by that
Canadian Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, the city of
Winnipeg	LOCATION	.

		With the
Mississippi	LOCATION	route completed on the one hand , and the Georgian Bay Canal on the other ,
Chi	PERSON	- cago would stand at the angle of two immense water-systems , -- one leading south to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, and ultimately through the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal to the
Pacific	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	; the other leading east to the
Atlantic	LOCATION	and to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Similarly ,
Winnipeg	LOCATION	bids fair to become the central point in a waterway system of almost equally stupen - dous proportions .

		When the works now under way , or promised , are completed ,
Winnipeg	LOCATION	will have water communication with
Edmonton	LOCATION	, at the foot of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	; a series of short canals , presenting no serious engineering difficulties , would connect with Lake Superior , and ultimately with
Montreal	LOCATION	and the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Scientific experts and hard-headed business men are already discussing the project of connecting -
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	and
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, by a series of short canals on the
Nelson River	LOCATION	; and it is quite within the realms of the possible that
Winnipeg	LOCATION	may some day be connected with the
Mississippi	LOCATION	by way of the
Red River	LOCATION	,
Lake Traverse	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Minnesota	LOCATION	.

		Given the devel - opment of these great waterways , -- and with the present trend of public opinion throughout the continent , such a development is quite probable , -- and the next half - century may wit - ness the curious spectacle of
Chicago	LOCATION	controlling the trade of
America	LOCATION	with
Asia	LOCATION	and
Australasia	LOCATION	; and
Winnipeg	LOCATION	controlling the trade of the conti - nent , or at any rate its western half , with
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Those who are inclined to scoff at this latter possibility need only be reminded that York Factory ,
Winnipeg	LOCATION	's future port on
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	, is eighty-six miles nearer Liverpool than is
New York	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 121 The Bordeblam -RRB- of
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The belief that human individuality survives the crisis known as death has been held from time immemorial , and is embodied in nearly all religious creeds .

		Inasmuch as all phenom - ena , in a literal sense , are psychological , and what we call the physical world is a picture painted with the pigments of the mind , it seems incredible that anything can be less real or less permanent than human consciousness .

		On the other hand , the temporary interruption of this consciousness is a commonplace experience ; while phenomena present themselves to us in such a way as to lead to the inference that those perceived are connected by many others , some ascertainable by inference , others wholly beyond our power to imagine .

		Modern science is like a cloth in which are utilized many scraps con - taining fragments of a pattern , on the basis of which the original design is attempted to be re - produced .

		It is universally admitted that the scraps -- our experiences -- do not represent the whole cloth ; the most stupid can see that they are parts of a larger scheme , but the wisest can not make sure of all the original details .

		Orthodox religion supposes that there exists a mind in which the pattern originated , and which , therefore , is well aware of the whole arrange - ment ; a philosophy which has the merit of finding a psychological counterpart for every phase of reality .

		It is one thing , however , to postulate con - sciousness as eternal and universal , and quite another to demonstrate an ultramundane career for such particular foci of it as we find in indi - vidual human beings .

		The reviewer , for his own part , has always believed in the continuity of personal identity , because it seems to him that any coherent philosophical scheme demands it , and that in the midst of very much that is certainly mutable there exists a nucleus of something permanent .

		This , however , is a metaphysical conception ; whereas Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	and the Society for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	seek to bring the subject within the range of scientific enquiry .

		It might be supposed that patient endeavors to throw light on matters so abstruse , and yet of such manifest importance to mankind , would be applauded on every hand .

		Constituted as man is , the fear and sorrow due to death seem • The Survival of Man .

		A Study in
Unrecognized Human Faculty	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	, F.RJS .

		New York :
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		at times almost too great a price to pay for our highly developed psychical powers , and at the least seriously reduce the pleasure of living .

		If they have been necessary for the preservation of the race , it seems evident that they have now exceeded somewhat the bounds of utility , and their mitigation might be welcomed for social as well as for individual reasons .

		This has been continually attempted in the past , by religious creeds ; and even to-day is accomplished to a large extent on more or less intangible grounds .

		Many still deem this sufficient , but it ought to be self-evident that definite scientific proof of survival would be a substantial gain .

		Unfortunately , the work of the
Society for Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	has met with no such favor as it seems to us to deserve .

		According to Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	, it is continually subjected to ad - verse criticism from the Spiritualists , who , long ago convinced of the survival of human person - ality after death , consider the methods employed ridiculously slow and cautious .

		On the other hand , the outside world and orthodox science generally regard it with contempt , as over - credulous and uncritical .

		The author concludes : '' Well , we have had to stand this buffeting , as well as the more ponderous blows inflicted by the other side ; and it was hardly necessary to turn the cheek to the smiter , since in an attitude of face-forward progress the buffets were sure to come with fair impartiality ; greater frequency on the one side making up for greater strength on the other . ''

		Sir
Oliver	PERSON	's book begins by a discussion of experiments which are held to demonstrate telep - athy .

		This phenomenon is accepted as genuine by many who do not believe at all in disembodied spirits .

		It is , in fact , one of the obstacles to the demonstration of the existence of the latter ; since if any of the facts communicated are known to any living being they may conceivably have been received telepathically , while if they are not known they may be incapable of proof .

		An endeavor to overcome this difficulty is described on page 122 .

		The late
F. W. H. Myers	PERSON	, in
1891	DATE	, prepared a sealed letter , the contents of which were known to no one but himself .

		About ten years later
Myers	PERSON	died , and in
1904	DATE	it seemed to several members of the Society that messages had been received which must contain the sub - stance of the hidden letter .

		Sir
Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	issued a circular inviting attendance at the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's rooms , and the envelope was opened .

		It was found that there was no resemblance between its actual contents and the messages received .

		Those hostile to the whole movement will of course receive this result with jeers ; but 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the author justly points out that failure was not unlikely after so long an interval , and that even success would not have been absolute proof .

		In the event of success it would have been conceiv - able that the letter was read by the medium through some process of clairvoyance ; or , I sup - pose , that its contents had been received tele - pathically by someone from
Myers	PERSON	during the latters lifetime , and were waiting in some sub - conscious region of the mind to be revealed in response to the proper stimulus .

		Absurd as these suppositions may seem , many would no doubt resort to them in preference to admitting the communication to be from someone now dead .

		An example given in the book , which is thought to represent a successful experiment , is quoted from
Kant	PERSON	as follows : ''
Madame Herteville	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Marteville -RRB- , the widow of the Dutch ambassador in
Stockholm	LOCATION	, some time after the death of her husband , was called upon by Croon , a gold - smith , to pay for a silver service which her husband had purchased from him .

		The widow was convinced that her late husband had been much too precise and orderly not to have paid this debt , yet she was unable to find this receipt .

		In her sorrow , and because the amount was considerable , she requested Mr.
Swedenborg	PERSON	to call at her house .

		After apologising to him for troubling him , she said that if , as all people say , he possessed the extra - ordinary gift of conversing with the souls of the departed , he would perhaps have the kindness to ask her husband how it was about the silver service .


Swedenborg	PERSON	did not at all object to comply with her request .

		Three days afterwards the said lady had company at her house for coffee .

		Swedenborg called , and in his cool way informed her that he had conversed with her husband .

		The debt had been paid several months before his decease , and the receipt was in a bureau in the room upstairs .

		The lady replied that the bureau had been quite cleared out and that the receipt was not found among all the papers .


Swedenborg	PERSON	said that her husband had described to him how after pulling out the lef thand drawer a board would appear , which required to be drawn out , when a secret compartment would be disclosed , containing his private Dutch correspondence , as well as the receipt .

		Upon hear - ing this description the whole company arose and accom - panied the lady into the room upstairs .

		The bureau was opened ; they did as they were directed ; the compart - ment was found , of which no one had ever known before ; and to the great astonishment of all , the papers were discovered there , in accordance with his description . ''

		A rather obvious objection to this piece of evidence is that
Swedenborg	PERSON	might have known of the existence of such a bureau in the house , and been aware that those of this make contained such a receptacle .

		It is not necessary to assume that he was acting a frivolous or insincere part ; impressed with the opinion that the receipt existed somewhere , his natural guess might have come into his mind with the force of a message , as is often the case in more commonplace circum - stances .

		Of course two different theories are possible , according to one 's convictions .

		It is possible to suppose that in the numerous cases in which strong conviction arises without any apparently sufficient evidence , there are super - normal agencies at work .

		A long account was given , on the authority of Mr.
H. W. Wack	PERSON	, of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	,
Minnesota	LOCATION	, of a dream in which the killing of a tramp was made known , though this occurred some distance away and the unknown man was of no particular in - terest to the dreamer .

		It is suggested that this shows how the influence of such an event may be conveyed not merely to those who would naturally be concerned , but to complete outsiders .

		The special thing noted by the dreamer was that , the tramp having been killed by the train in which he imagined himself to be travelling , the body could not be found .

		The next day he read in the paper of such an occurrence , the account stating that the body had been cut to small pieces , and no identification was possible .

		Several objections to the value of this evidence occur readily to the reader who is familiar with American railroads .

		The dreamer had been accustomed to travel on this particular road , and must often have read of and pondered over the killing of tramps , which is a much more frequent occurrence than
Sir Oliver Lodge	ORGANIZATION	probably imagines .

		If at all sensitive he must have dreaded the possibility of being present when one of these accidents occurred .

		Moreover , the dream explicitly shows the train as stopping immediately after the man had given his death - shriek , whereas the newspaper stated that it did not stop at all , but proceeded in ignorance of the accident , which explained the condition of the remains .

		The inability to find the body in the dream is in accordance with a common ex - perience in dreams , when the expected fails to happen .

		In the above account I have laid emphasis on the evidence which seems to me to be faulty ; that which has a better claim is much more com - plicated , and will not admit of abstraction .

		Sir Oliver Lodge states that he is thoroughly convinced by it , but recognizes that much more work needs to be done to put the matter on a proper basis . ''

		It rather feels as if we were at the beginning of what is practically a fresh branch of science ; and that to pretend to frame explanations , except in the most tentative and elastic fashion for the purpose of thread - ing the facts together and suggesting fresh fields for experiments , is as premature as it would have been for Galvani to have expounded the nature of electricity , or Copernicus the laws of Comets and Meteors '' -LRB- p. 239 -RRB- .

		The weakness '' A Power & * round ^ M * weak '' and the power ness '' -- these are the words
Shelley of Shelley	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ ^ f himself in the '' Adonais '' ; and it would be hard for any biographer to improve upon the brevity and truth of his own characteriza - tion .

		Most biographers , in fact , have either tried to hide the weakness -- as if to acknowledge it were to belittle the Power , -- or else have thrown the limelight upon the weakness until the
Power	ORGANIZATION	almost lost itself in the shadows .

		It is twenty-four years since
Dowden	PERSON	collected his great body of materials and wrote what will probably always remain the standard biography of
Shelley	LOCATION	; the form of the man there presented has not been changed materially by any documents or facts that have since been brought to light .

		That
Shelley	PERSON	as a poet belongs among the world 's great ones , few would now have the hardi - hood to deny ; but considered as a man , the question is still open .

		Were certain of his contemporaries right who regarded him as a fiend incarnate , or are his modern admirers right who pronounce him unfit for this world only because he was fit for a better ?

		Among the numerous attempts at appraisal of
Shelley	PERSON	in his human aspect , perhaps none is saner and fairer , and certainly none more spirited and entertaining , than the book of nearly three hundred pages offered by Mr.
A. Clutton-Brock	PERSON	, '' Shelley the Man and the Poet '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author 's attitude toward his subject seems to be not unlike that often felt toward those we love best , -- their worst faults amuse rather than irritate us .

		Thus , speaking of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's early opinions of religion , he says : u Having got his own idea of what the world ought to be almost as easily as a baby gets its appe - tite , he found that the Christian religion did not fall in with that idea and determined to destroy it with a light heart . ''

		Again , quoting from one of the in - numerable manifestos of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's youth , the author adds : '' As we read these pompous and complacent sentences we must remember he was only nineteen ; and it is well at that age to have the ambition to reform the world . ''

		Much of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's most ques - tionable writing and conduct came from the fact that he had no historical sense , and '' never under - stood that all the institutions which he hated had been made by men of the same nature as those whom he wished to deliver from such institutions '' ; all his arguments were based on the assumption that '' men would be all good if laws did not make them bad , '' and that '' the conflict of life is entirely a struggle between the good that is within men and the evil that is outside them . ''

		Some men , therefore , were all bad , being willing slaves of the tyrant evil ; others were all good , being heroic rebels or helpless victims .

		In his treatment of the H
Harriet	PERSON	question , '' our author is uncommonly fair , saying truly , u Be - cause he was a great poet and she a poor woman who came to a miserable end , there is no reason why her memory should be sacrificed to his . ''

		Shelley had many infirmities of heart and mind , and was never cured of them ; to the end they appeared in his poetry , and troubled
Mary	PERSON	as they had brought disaster to
Harriet	PERSON	- But his character was essentially noble , his genius great .

		He always desired to love men and to be loved by them ; but from lack of communion with them , he became the intimate friend of nature .

		Often , in his poetry , he seems to sing to an audience of mountains and winds and clouds , as if they would understand him better than the human beings who received his music with anger or laughter .

		The reader who would understand or enjoy
Shelley	PERSON	's best poetry must not ask what is the use of it all ; he must have faith in it as a prophecy of a nobler state of being , and as the expression of emotions and ideas to which men in that nobler state may some day attain .

		As a whole , Mr.
Clutton-Brock	PERSON	has given us a delight - ful book ; for even when we least agree with him we can not help delighting in the easy but sure touch with which he re-tells the always fascinating story of
Shelley	PERSON	's life , and interprets his singular charac - ter and his splendid genius .

		A `` footnote person '' is the phrase y # #
otZ %	PERCENT	ie , .

		> borrowed by Mr.
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, and applied by him to
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	in one of the brief essays contained in a volume of collected studies entitled ''
Carlyle	PERSON	's Laugh , and Other Surprises '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We trust that it will seem no reflection upon their interest or value to characterize these studies by this same use - ful phrase .

		Slight and sketchy as they are , these papers are pleasantly indicative of personal and often intimate association with many a distinguished man and woman of letters .

		Their value lies in this , not in completeness of portraiture or depth of interpre - tative comment .

		The collection includes a score of articles previously published in periodical or book , on
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	,
Brockden Brown	PERSON	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Alcott	LOCATION	,
Bancroft	LOCATION	,
Norton	PERSON	,
Stedman	PERSON	,
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	,
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	,
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	,
Julia Ward Howe	PERSON	, and several others .

		They are all pleasantly written -- they are all in a sense '' footnotes '' to more adequate studies of their subjects .

		One may read with especial interest the paper on
Emily Dickinson	PERSON	, whose story recalls our debt to Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	for his introduction to the world of this strangely gifted woman .

		One is glad also to possess even this brief sketch of that modest and 124 THE DIAL -LSB-

		tireless literary worker ,
Horace Scudder	PERSON	; it is a tribute well deserved , and might have been ex - panded with advantage .

		The best of the essays , however , is that which opens the volume .

		Has `` Carlyle 's laugh , '' by the way , been described in literature , since Teuf elsdrOckh 's hearty cachinnation was echoed in the `` Sartor Resartus '' ?

		`` It was a broad , honest , human laugh , '' says Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	, '' which , beginning in the brain , took into its action the whole heart and diaphragm , and instantly changed the worn face into something frank and even winning , giving to it an expression that would have won the confidence of any child . ''

		Speaking truthfully , this echo of the Sartorian laughter is the pleasant '' surprise '' in the volume ; indeed , we do not recollect that we discovered any other contribu - tion that quite justified the promise in the latter part of the title .

		Books upon the opera multiply in proportion to the awakening activ - ities of the operatic world .

		Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	's `` Guide to Modern Opera '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a companion volume to her earlier book of similar design , and describes works of the most modern school .

		A few of the old works , such as `` Otello , '' '' Mefistofile , '' and `` Parsifal , '' are included only because they did not find a place in the earlier volume .

		But such moderns as
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	,
Strauss	PERSON	,
Charpentier	PERSON	,
Humperdinck	PERSON	, and
Blockx	PERSON	, get most of the pages .

		Twenty-six operas are described altogether , and there are a dozen illustrations of fa - mous singers , in character .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	tells the stories , but attempts little or nothing of musical analysis and criticism .

		-- Miss
Gladys Davidson	PERSON	gives us a similar book , with an added dash of biography , in the third series of her `` Stories from the Operas '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , published in the `` Music Lover 's Li - brary . ''

		She describes works to the number of an even dozen , and the illustrations are portraits of composers .

		-- Mr.
H. E. Krehbiel	PERSON	's `` Book of Operas '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a far more serious performance than these others .

		It goes extensively into musical history , besides providing competent analysis with illustra - tions in musical notation .

		There are also many other illustrations of varied and often of curious interest , such as a portrait of da
Ponte	ORGANIZATION	, the Americanized Italian who wrote
Mozart	PERSON	's most famous librettos , of a number of scenes historically interesting , of com - posers , singers , and stage-pictures .

		Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	deals with a total of seventeen works , chosen because their importance may claim such thorough treatment as he aims to give .

		They include the three great operas of
Mozart	PERSON	, the five of
Wagner	PERSON	-LRB- excluding the `` Ring '' -RRB- ,
Verdi	PERSON	's `` Traviata '' and `` Aida , '' and such single examples as '' Fidelio , '' '' II Barbiere '' and `` Der Freischtttz , '' and `` Hansel und Gretel . ''

		The other three to complete the tale are the group dealing with the
Faust	PERSON	story , the works of
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	,
Boito	PERSON	, and
Berlioz	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a very interesting and val - uable book , which we commend to the attention of all opera-goers .

		-- While on the subject of music , we may as well make note of
Elise Polko	PERSON	's '' Musical Sketches '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an old-time favorite with the sentimental , now translated from the fif - teenth German edition .

		It is still not a bad book for the young .

		-- ``
Stokes	PERSON	* Encyclopedia of Music and Musicians '' has been a useful reference-book for some time , and is now reissued in a revised and enlarged edition , prepared by Mr.
L. J. de Bekkers	PERSON	.

		It is a volume of seven hundred and fifty two - columned pages .

		One of the hopeful signs in the war - Some ounce * f a gr a i ns t disease , which is being of prevention .

		.

		° ' ° so vigorously waged in recent years , is the growing number of books dealing with medi - cal subjects written by competent authorities and designed primarily for the general public .

		Dr.
Woods Hutchinson	PERSON	's '' Preventable Diseases '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is not only authoritative and comprehensive , but it is sane and sensible , and likewise most entertaining reading .

		It treats of hygienic and sanitary matters of prime importance and profound interest to every individual , family , and community ; and the advice so freely given , if sensibly followed , will do much to check the outbreak and spread of preventable diseases and to reduce the suffering and misery that follow in their wake .

		The book is written in a free and breezy style .

		The author 's opinions are ex - pressed with clearness and vigor , and popular fads and fallacies are exposed in plain language .

		He is a wholesome and rational optimist , and every page of his book breathes hope and inspires courage to the individual or community in the fight against disease .

		The treatment of heredity and disease is eminently sensible , and will be a godsend to many distressed souls .

		The discussion of '' Tuberculosis , a scotched snake , '' is also well fitted to bring hope where fear reigns .

		Censervatives will doubtless find fault at times with the author 's picturesque state - ments and free discussion of professional data , but all must admire his breadth of view and humane purpose .

		Among the topics treated are the natural powers of recuperation of the body , so often under - estimated ; the signs of disease , typhoid fever , ade - noids , colds , cancer , nerves , appendicitis , malaria , rheumatism , diphtheria , and mental influence in disease .

		The book is a desirable addition to the library of both home and school .

		Mr.
G. E. Scott Elliott	PERSON	, author of a up-date .

		handsome volume entitled '' Botany of To-Day '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , reveals himself as an Englishman and a traveller .

		His inter - est in botany is probably incidental to his journeying about the world ; but he would fain have others share his enthusiasm , and so he writes a book , -- having in view the worthy end , as he expresses it , '' to tempt some readers to examine plants for themselves . ''

		If readers are not thus tempted it will not be because Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	has not brought before them avast amount of material , botanical and other .

		His industry and zeal are beyond question : the whole field of attain - ment and research shall be his , from the cedar of
Lebanon	LOCATION	to the hysop that springeth from the wall .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 Unfortunately , his zeal is not always according to knowledge .

		Not being a botanist himself , his dis - crimination is often at fault ; and notwithstanding hosts of high authorities cited , he sometimes falls into error , -- as when he tells us that leaves of the Victoria pond-lily are sixty feet across , or when he groups our pretty flowering Vallisneria among the algce .

		Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	seems also deficient in what is called literary style .

		The chapters have no special sequence or arrangement , and are broken into a mul - titude of paragraphs where sentence is disjoined from sentence for no obvious reason , but with an effect upon the reader which is , to say the least , dishearten - ing ; he experiences a succession of mental jolts , as if compelled to traverse a corduroy road , instead of following the smooth chaussee prepared for him by a more skilful writer .

		The sentences themselves are scarcely models of correct construction ; the verbs have a fashion of being attracted into the number of the noun nearest , rather than yielding to the milder solicitations of the remoter sentence - subject .

		A single instance may suffice to illustrate many things : '' Near lake
Nyanza	LOCATION	I rose a grasshopper-like creature which alighted on a withered grass haulm and was at once invisible .

		Its mode of resting aped exactly the hang of withered spikelets , and the color of such part of its wings and legs as were exposed were precisely that of the withered vegetation . ''

		Two chapters -- one on Conifers and one on Arable Land -- are per - haps the most useful in the book , being compends of the agriculture of the British Isles .

		The bibliography which closes the volume will be serviceable to stu - dents ; and there are many beautiful half-tone illus - trations , some of which refer to matters discussed in the text .

		-- Eugenics , the new science of `` breed - For the culture 1 a '' • j i of the race .

		mg better men , is developmg at a rapid rate .

		It was only a few years ago that Sir
Francis Galton	PERSON	began his active cam - paign for the promotion of eugenic research and the dissemination of eugenic ideas .

		Now strong and flourishing organizations making these matters their specific business exist in
England	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		While the stream of periodical litera - ture on the subject is steadily increasing in volume , books dealing directly with it have as yet been few .

		Dr.
C. W. Saleeby	PERSON	's `` Parenthood and Race Culture '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the first attempt to give a comprehensive view of the general problems of engenics , and the direction which examination of them seems likely to take .

		Dr.
Saleeby	PERSON	is a man of strong , if not always profoundly reasoned , opinions , and his presentation of the case is forceful and inter - esting .

		He lays great stress on the importance of reducing the infant mortality rate .

		In general he appears to regard a low birth-rate as in no way inherently an alarming or even a serious matter , provided the rate of infant mortality is concurrently reduced .

		Many could be found who would not agree with these ideas , but that is not necessarily against them .

		In so relatively new and important a field of thought a full and frank presentation of all points of view and shades of opinion is much to be desired .

		The care with which the proof-reading of this volume was done is indicated by the following curious ver - sion of a well-known quotation which stands at the head of a chapter : '' L'homme n'est gu'un yoseau , le plus faible de la Nature ; mais c'est an yoseau pensant . ''

		`` Truth forever on the scaffold , wrong ttaXTal .

Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page ,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a collection of speeches and papers from the tongue and pen of the late Henry
Demarest Lloyd	PERSON	; but the poet 's words are repeatedly brought to mind as one reads Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's vigorous protests , iterated and reiterated , against the greed and injustice of plutocracy , and his eloquent plea for justice to the working man and a recognition of his rights as a human being .

		The speeches now gathered into a book were delivered at various times between
1889	DATE	and
1903	DATE	, the latter year being that of the
Anthracite Coal Strike Commission	ORGANIZATION	, before which Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	spoke so effectively .

		His homely and telling way of putting things is often illustrated in the pages of this volume , -- as when , referring to '' government by injunction , '' he speaks of '' punishment at the mercy of a judge 's sour tem per or sour stomach '' ; and again , '' There is another end to this poker . ''

		Idioms of this sort must have proved effective with audiences of working people .

		Probably , too , he touched a responsive chord when he styled Mr.
John Mitchell	PERSON	'' first in strikes , first in arbitration , and first in the hearts of the working - men . ''

		In a speech delivered on the fourth of
July , 1889	DATE	, are the words : `` Eighteen hundred and eighty - nine declares that ... property , like government , has no just powers but those which it derives from the consent of the people . ''

		Have the twenty-one intervening years brought any convincing proofs that this truth is gaining general recognition ?

		The vol - ume contains many striking passages testifying to Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's quick reading of the signs of the times , and his unselfish ardor for human rights and justice .

		„ , Old if arm published his first obser - vations on American ants .

		During these years , Dr.
McCook	PERSON	has been a close student of the life and ways of these little creatures whose social organization reaches a higher grade of differentiation than can be found in any other group of animals short of the human species .

		In his book on '' Ant Communities and how they are Governed , a Study in Natural Civics '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , the author sums up his own obser - vations and those of others upon ants , considering mainly those phases of their life that pertain to their behavior as social animals .

		From this arises a second feature of the volume , namely , the suggestions of parellels and differences between the communal actions of ants and those of men considered in their relation to the highest welfare of the race .

		To ants , as well as to men , the commune is a school which has 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, been a great diversifying factor in their social evolu - tion .

		In the ant community the devotion to the com - mon weal is instant and absolute , even to the loss of life or limb ; but the queen has no sceptre , there is no ruling class , and every ant is a law unto itself .

		If socialism as a form of human government would be equally successful , it must attain that perfect individ - ual discipline , self-control , and self-devotion to the good of the whole community , that one sees in a commonwealth of ants .

		The book is interesting as natural history , and will be suggestive to all con - cerned with the foundations of social organization .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Most expert observers have not ceased to regard the
George Junior	PERSON	Republic as a social experiment , with too short a history and too narrow a range for final conclu - sions .

		None the less the story of its development by a man who discovered his pedagogical principles as oc - casion arose , generally after failures , is full of interest .

		The fundamental idea of Mr.
George	PERSON	's '' The Junior Republic '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is that training for responsible citizenship must begin in an actual community where the laws and institutions express the convictions of the people .

		Scepticism is apt to arise in relation to a scheme which seems to ignore the transitional character of immature persons , and to require them , perhaps only in appearance , to assume the tasks of adults .

		The anecdotes and pictures from real life are genuine rev - elations of the souls of young people .

		To interpret the facts and activities of the present day from a socially constructive standpoint , having in view chiefly the common welfare , is the aim of Dr.
Devine	PERSON	's little volume on '' Social Forces '' -LRB-
Charities Publication Committee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a collection of editorials which have appeared from time to time since
1907	DATE	in '' The Survey . ''

		The essays are simply written , and deal with a wide range of American problems .

		The '' new view '' advocated by Dr.
Devine	PERSON	implies neither an unthinking enthusiasm for the poor and oppressed on the one hand , nor a remote cold scrutiny of human problems on the other , but an inspiring and earnest eagerness to set things in their right relations , to work slowly but steadily for a '' social order in which ancient wrongs shall be righted , new corruptions foreseen and prevented , the nearest approach to equality of opportunity assured , and the individual rediscovered under conditions vastly more favorable for his greatest usefulness to his fellows and for the highest development of all his powers . ''

		The bibliographer can do no more useful work than that of directing the reading of children into the right channels .

		An important adjunct to such work will be found in the '' Children 's Catalog '' which has been com - piled by Miss
Marion E. Potter	PERSON	and others , and is pub - lished by the
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first part of this work is an author , title , and subject catalogue of three thou - sand books , based upon a selection of the lists approved by twenty-four libraries .

		The second and larger part provides an index to the later volumes of '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	'' and analytical subject references to five hundred of the books for children previously catalogued .

		The work should prove of great usefulness .

		We have at the same time two books from the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	, being `` A Child 's Guide to Reading , '' by Mr.
John Macy	PERSON	, and `` A Child 's Guide to Biography , '' by Mr.
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	.

		NOTES 155 TOPICS IN MARCH PERIODICALS 156 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 156 LITERARY CENSORSHIP .

		How far is it legitimate for authority to go in regulating the liberties of the public with respect to their habits , their diversions , and the indul - gence of their individual tastes in general ?

		Be - tween the extremes of fanatical intolerance and unbridled license there are many intermediate degrees ; at what point in the series may we find the golden mean which shall protect the unwary from actual peril , and which yet shall curb no innocent inclination ?

		The question is far - reaching , and instances in point are abundantly supplied to the student either of history or of present social conditions .

		Authority always tends to abuse its power , and eternal vigilance is the price of many kinds of liberty that lie wholly without the political sphere .

		The aims of the fanatic or the doctrinaire are no less repugnant to sanity than are the easy-going ideals of the philosophy of laisser faire as applied to the vicious propensities of mankind .

		But in all doubtful cases , we think that the burden of proof lies upon the shoulders of those who advocate restriction ; for individual freedom of thought and action is far too precious a thing , and has been achieved by civilization at far too heavy a cost , to be subjected to the risk of unnecessary impairment .

		There are no more pestiferous people on earth than those who , clothed in a little brief authority , seek to misuse it by forcing its unfortunate subjects to conform to their own narrow ideas of conduct .

		The long chapter of folly and failure which records the history of restrictive and sumptu - ary and prohibitive law-making is highly in - structive in its teaching , and its lessons have to be learned anew through bitter experience by every new generation .

		In matters of purely intellectual concern , it gives us warning exam - ples in the form of trials for heresy , actions against sedition , and all kinds of restraints upon the press , the pulpit , and the platform .

		The very idea of censorship has become suspect , so uniformly has the practice been associated with the suppression of ideas that had far better been left free to find vent .

		And yet .

		if the question is pressed home , there is probably no individu - alist so confirmed as to deny the social necessity of setting some limits to freedom of expression .

		Society can not , considering its own safety , per - 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, mit open incitement to what is universally rec - ognized as crime , or open encouragement to what all but the hopelessly perverted will admit to be dangerous immorality .

		These considera - tions , however , would have to be stretched out of all shape to justify so ridiculous an institu - tion as the long-established licensing of plays in
England	LOCATION	, or the more recent effort on the part of the great English libraries to inaugurate a system of censorship over current literature .

		The censorship of the English stage is not likely to last much longer in anything like its old form , for it has been so riddled by the pro- tests of practically the entire guild of dramatic authorship that it is obviously crumbling into a ruin .

		A system that makes it impossible to produce '' The Cenci '' on an English stage , that creates difficulties in the case of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and that has nothing to say about the license of the music halls , the imbecilities of musical comedy , or the viciousness of works that make a jest of every - thing that is fundamental to morality , -- such a system can hardly expect to find serious defenders .

		If it be not swept away altogether , the substitute devised for it will not continue to put a premium upon the most degrading tend - encies of the modern stage , while prohibiting the earnest discussion of vital questions .

		No regulation at all would be far better than the old legalized hypocrisy , and the police could take care of really flagrant offences against decency .

		An attempted censorship of books just now shares the attention of the English public with the long-debated question of the licensing of plays .

		It is an effort on the part of the great circulating libraries to save their customers from contamination by books deemed unsuitable for general reading .

		This private and self-appointed censorship has aroused no little indignation , not only among publishers , who think themselves quite as competent censors as anybody else , but among intelligent readers as well , who naturally resent such misguided paternalism .

		It is a rather serious matter ; for the sales of a pub - lisher in
England	LOCATION	depend largely upon the atti - tude of the libraries , which purchase new books by the hundreds and thousands of copies .

		In the case of many a book , the library orders are necessary to make its publication profitable , since the sales to private buyers alone would not suffice to cover the cost of production .

		The libraries have sought to establish a modus vivendi by requesting that books be submitted to their
august	DATE	consideration in advance of pub - lication , and on this will be based the approval or rejection of them for library circulation .

		But this scheme seems rather hard on the publishers , who will have incurred a considerable part of the expense of bringing out a book before the ver - dict of the libraries is made known .

		If books are to be censored at all in this fashion , it should obviously be done in manuscript , while there is time for a publisher to withdraw from what may be a disastrous enterprise .

		Besides , such a method savors altogether too much of the '' leave to print '' which is associated with the most obnoxious form of ecclesiastical tyranny .

		The system seems , however , to be already in limited operation , and two novels have recently been placed upon this new Index Librorum Prohibitorum .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' thus comments upon the incident : '' The library censorship has already fallen into the trap which , in the present condition of English letters , awaits all censorship , literary or theatrical .

		It has assumed as its standard a certain type of marketable article , and has decided that it will not countenance any deviations from that standard .

		Two books have been refused circulation ; whether by way of the major or the minor excommunication , by a refusal to sell them , or to recommend them for sale unless they hap - pen to be specially asked for , we do not know .

		Neither , so far as we can discover , contains a gross word or an alluring description . ''

		Contrasting this work with work that has no difficulty in escaping censure , the writer goes on to say : '' If it is to be compared with the kind of fiction which the old commercial freedom and the new com - mercial censorship -LRB- and they are mere varieties of the same spirit -RRB- usually encourages , the contrast is in the main between work which is moral in intention and in effect , and work which has no kind of moral aim or result , between meretricious , venal , and absurdly un - christian writing , and the effort to represent things as they are , or to discover regenerative forces wherever they may exist . ''

		The conclusion of the discussion is tersely put : `` The libraries , indeed , are following the path set them by Mr.
Redford	PERSON	.

		It will lead to disaster . ''

		Fortunately , no question of this sort can arise in our own country .

		We are a people of private book-buyers who , for better or worse , will pur - chase the books that we wish to read .

		No pri - vate library trust seeks to regulate our tastes and determine what is good for us .

		On the other hand , our public libraries , being distinctly educational agencies supported by public taxa - tion , have a responsibility which they are bound to accept .

		Instead of giving the public the read - ing it wants , their plain duty is to encourage the better kind of reading .

		But this duty is per - formed , be it observed , not by putting particular books under the ban , but by selecting from the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 many that clamor for purchase the comparatively few that the resources of a given library permit to be purchased .

		Here is no conspiracy in restraint of the trade in imaginings , but an exercise of discriminative judgment on the part of each library , acting singly and for its own pur - poses .

		In taking this course , any library may blunder now and then -- and grotesque examples of such blundering frequently come to light -- but no book that is worth while is likely by such sporadic action to be kept out of the public reach or have its fortunes seriously impaired .

		Between this system and the English library censorship there is all the difference that exists between organized effort and free individual initiative .

		BEING A CRITIC .

		Being a critic is not all beer and skittles .

		The popular opinion of him is of one who has not learned any science or succeeded in any art , and is therefore empowered to sit in judgment on those who have .

		u Can you sing ? ''

		asked the Maestro of the aspiring pupil .

		u No ! '' ''

		Can you play ? '' ''

		No ! '' ''

		Then I do n't see anything for you but to teach music '' As a matter of fact , nine out of ten of the good literary critics have been great creative artists or philosophers .

		A critic can hardly have too wide a range of knowledge .

		The literatures , philosophies , sciences , and arts of the world must be measurably well known to him .

		And he must have experience of nature and humanity , so that he can check his texts .

		Of course it is not to be expected that he shall know all these matters as well as the separate practitioners of them know each one , -- nor is it necessary .

		To compare , to contrast , to bring together widely sepa - rated works and ideas , to trace the analogies between things , to arrive at underlying principles , -- these are the offices of the critic .

		The specializing is almost the opposite of the critical mind .

		The mere analysis or appreciation of single works , unless backed up by such broad knowledge , or dictated by some rare instinctive taste , is apt to be hurtful rather than helpful .

		And minute knowledge in one direc - tion alone does not help much .

		It is doubtless a solace and a joy to know Anglo-Saxon , but it is something better to be able to detect in
Caedmon	LOCATION	the beginning of that high and haughty English strain , that Titanism , which comes out in
Marlowe	LOCATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	, and
Byron	PERSON	, -- all of whom were , in Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	's phrase , u great and rebellious sons of God . ''

		But there is a special training which a critic ought to have , even though he is an inspired appre - ciator .

		It consists of a study of the basic elements of literature which the great critics of the past have dug up , and of the casual utterances or well con - sidered opinions on their art which great writers have thrown out .

		To go without these would be like a player trying to dispense with the traditions of the stage ; like a man trying to be a great lawyer with only the knowledge of the Statute-book of his own
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the mass of this opinion is to-day so great that to know it is a business in itself .

		It is not to be supposed that anyone can keep it all in his head at once .

		The real critic will have tried to read most of it , but he will keep the best and let the rest go .

		It is probable that he will be able to stand an examination on the Kadapais of Aristotle , or Les - sing 's demarcation of poetry and painting , or
Schil	PERSON	- ler 's definition of art as the play instinct and his distinction between the Beautiful and the Charac - teristic , or
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's explanation of Imagination and Fancy , or De Quincey 's differentiation of the Literature of Power and the Literature of Knowl - edge , or
Arnold	LOCATION	's phrases about the
Grand Style and Natural Magic	ORGANIZATION	.

		But just what the
Daciers	PERSON	said in the fight between the supporters of Ancient and Modern Literature , or what
John Dennis	PERSON	thought of
Dryden	PERSON	or the German criticism of
Bodmer	PERSON	and Gottsehed , may well escape him .

		Yet all this mass of past criticism and opinion is like the leaves which have fallen , the trees which have rotted , the rocks which have disintegrated ; and , once taken into the mind , it forms a humus or soil in which new crops can be grown .

		There are two large works in English which to - gether sum up the whole course or growth of literary opinion .

		They are
Bosanquet 's History of ^ Esthetics	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's
History of Criticism	ORGANIZATION	.

		The difference between these two books , apparently parallel , is amazing .

		Bc-anquet tunnels under - ground ; he dives into the caverns of metaphysic and psychology , -- he spares no labor .

		Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury skims along the surface , skips from flower to flower , and declines to meddle with anything that looks ugly or forbidding .

		Bosanquet 's book is one of the most difficult in the language ; it is harder than his originals , because , of course , he has to con - dense whole theories and treatises into a few para - graphs or pages .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's book is written in a lively and exhilarating style , and is itself liter - ature .

		But
Bosanquet	PERSON	goes to the root of the matter , and reports in a colorless and unprejudiced way all the deepest divinations of the ages .

		Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury is , in spite of his vast erudition , shallow ia treatment , and from first to last is the victim of a preconceived theory of his own .

		Reading Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is like indulging in a long course of sugar-plums which is pretty sure to disorder the stomach ; reading Bosanquet is like taking repeated doses of senna and quassia to set it right again .

		Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	's little treatise on the Fine Arts is perhaps a mean between these two works , and will give anyone a fair idea of the questions which criti - cism propounds and tries to answer .

		But there are certain texts of criticism which the modern critic must know for himself .

		One of these is Aristotle 's '' Poetics . ''

		It is probably a fragment , as it does not cover the whole range of Greek liter - 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, ature .

		Excepting some scattered and generally slighting remarks on poetry in
Plato	LOCATION	, and the lively and just appreciations of tragic poetry in `` The Frogs '' of Aristophanes , it is the earliest extant document of criticism .

		And it is the best .

		It is , indeed , the corner-stone of all sound criticism .

		No - where else is there so much pregnancy and pro- fundity ; such keen analysis of literature and its relation to life .

		The greater part of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's judgments are as valid to-day as when they were written .

		A second great foundation of criticism is
Lessing	PERSON	's '' LaocoOn . ''

		Taken as a survey of litera - ture , it is even more fragmentary than the '' Poetics , '' for it deals mainly with one point -- the differentia - tion of the matter and powers of poetry and painting .

		But the white light of truth which it sheds on this subject pierces to the farthest cranny of literature .

		Longinus is the ancient type of the inspired appre - ciator -- the man of taste rather than of analysis .

		The greatest critic of this kind in modern times is probably Goethe .

		The discursive remarks on litera - ture and art scattered through his autobiography , his essays , letters , conversations with
Eckermann	PERSON	, form as large a body of good criticism as exists anywhere .

		But the difference between his way of criticising and
Lessing	PERSON	's is immense .

		The latter pierced to one cen - tral truth , good for all time ; developed it , and made it immovable .

		Goethe shifts his point of view around and around : now he sees the shield gold , now silver ; now he is Gothic , now Greek .

		Pretty much all his work in criticism may be , and in fact has been , done over .

		Take for example his criti - cism on Hamlet , in ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	. ''

		Fine as this is , it has been pretty well riddled by recent analysis .

		Schiller is of the school of Aristotle and
Lessing	PERSON	and
Kant	PERSON	.

		His '' ^ Esthetic Letters '' are a mine of rich discoveries in criticism .

		The Schlegels are perhaps more remarkable for the pupils they taught and inspired than for their own work , good as this is .

		Heine is the
King	ORGANIZATION	's jester of criticism --
Lear	PERSON	's Fool -- who says the wisest things under the guise of mocking folly .

		Nearly all the great German phi - losophers --
Kant	PERSON	,
Schelling	PERSON	,
Hegel	LOCATION	-- have discussed the aesthetic problems .

		Schopenhauer is as great in criticism as in philosophy .

		He has such skill in words that he can make our dissolution into nothing - ness seem a delight , and he paints the martyrdom of genius so attractively that one would not wish to be spared a single nail of the cross .

		The vast mass of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	's prose works contains much penetrating and true criticism .

		He was a great man of letters , a great dramatic poet , by the grace of God , -- a musician , I should say , by the determina - tion of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		England must take off its hat to
Germany	LOCATION	in criticism , as
Germany	LOCATION	must go down on its knees to
England	LOCATION	in creation .

		For foundation criticism ^ the establishment of first principles , there is no equality between them ; and in the gathering of seed - bearing vitalities of thought ,
England	LOCATION	has hardly been more than a gleaner in the field where Ger - many has reaped a full harvest .

		Even so , there are important discoveries and distinctions in
Coleridge	LOCATION	, DeQuincey , and
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		But in appreciation , the comparison of writer with writer , of epoch with epoch ,
England	LOCATION	is rich enough .

		In the works of
Hazlitt	PERSON	, for instance , while there is , I suppose , hardly a sentence which goes to the bottom , hardly a truth which really teaches , what zest , what gusto , what picture , what reflection and reverberation of his subjects , what inspiration to a love for literature !

		He is , in fact , the typical English-writing critic , -- for our masters in this trade have mainly desired to bring to our lips the rich full-bodied wine of lit - erature , rather than to offer to our hands a vial of biting acid with which we might analyze master - pieces and see what they are made of .

		Yet
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's prism decomposes , and
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's phrases disintegrate ; and they are the greatest of English - writing critics .

		American criticism has followed , in the main , the English human rather than the German abstract method .

		It has great names in
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Stedman	PERSON	.

		Each of these has been , in his own way , a sort of camera obscura reproducing in miniature the varied hues and forms of the literatures of the world .

		Poe flocked by himself , and was analytic .

		I think he was nearly always wrong in his princi - ples and nearly always right in his practice of criti - cism .

		Lanier , who acquired some reputation as a critic , is wrong in both respects .

		The man who could prostrate himself before
George Eliot	PERSON	like a
South Sea Islander	LOCATION	before his fetish , and could recommend that
Sterne	PERSON	and Fielding be thrown into the sewer , has no critical authority which anyone is bound to respect .

		``
France	LOCATION	, famed in all great arts , in none supreme , '' is not even supreme in criticism , in which it has made so great an effort .

		Of its criticism of the past , the schools of
Boileau	PERSON	and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, no one would have much to say now .

		It has wit and it has good sense , and it is utterly uninspired .

		The best of this kind is Moliere 's manly good sense in '' Les Pre ` cieuses Ridicules , '' '' Le Misanthrope , '' and '' Les Femmes Savantes . ''

		But
France	LOCATION	's recent criticism has a great name .

		Sainte-Beuve is acclaimed a prince in the profession .

		Lowell , I imagine , was thinking of him when in one of his last papers he coined the phrase `` detective criticism . ''

		I should prefer to call it the criticism of gossip .

		It is bio - graphical in intent ; and as there are a hundred people who want to know about a poet 's love affairs , or how much money he had in his purse , to one who cares anything for his verses , this sort of criticism has been popular .

		Sainte-Beuve has of course deli - cacy , finesse , justness of mind .

		But he deals by preference with second-rate or third-rate or tenth - rate geniuses .

		A really great writer frightens him as much as Snug thought his personation of the lion would frighten the ladies .

		Taine rather goes to the other extreme .

		He is somewhat like a boy who gets drunk for fear he should be thought a mollycoddle .

		He is so determined that everybody
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 he writes about shall be in a passion , that he makes us think that the great writers were always shouting at the top of their voices .

		But he has a genuine feeling for greatness , and despite his Procrustean method is usually right in his sense of proportion .

		To me ,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is more important than the whole of Sainte-Beuve .

		Arnold made good fun of its occasional rhodomon - tade , and the invariable implied winding up of the innumerable roll-calls of poets and prophets with '' and
Victor Hugo	PERSON	. ''

		But it is noble in its belief in nobility , great in its advocacy of greatness .

		And it has delicacies which surpass those of Sainte-Beuve as much as the hangings of the dawn surpass those of a ballroom .

		Beside Hugo ,
Sainte-Beuve	ORGANIZATION	's atti - tudes and graces are as those of a dancing-master to the pose of a king .

		It is true that Sainte-Beuve can probably be trusted to have read a good deal of the qooks he criticised ; whereas one always harbors the suspicion that Hugo , like Mr.
Boffin	PERSON	's mentor , had not gone right slap through his poets and prophets and historians very recently .

		Instinctive taste and the analytic faculty -- these are the two qualifications for a critic .

		The fault with taste is its want of certitude .

		It may be right or it may be wrong , and it changes from age to age , almost from season to season . ''

		I do n't know anything about art , but I know what I like , '' -- that is the natural human cry .

		Taste offers assertion without argument , opinion without proof ; its value in the end must depend on whether it is backed up by previous analysis .

		By itself , analysis is dry enough .

		It does not appeal , but it carries .

		It pre - serves the proportion and significance of things , and keeps mankind from straying too far after false gods .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A PUBLISHER WITH AN ENVIABLE RECORD for honorable dealing , sane and conservative methods , dignified restraint , real service to the cause of lit - erature and learning , and a good degree of pecun - iary success therewith , has recently rounded out his threescore and ten years of life and forty-five of business experience , and has marked the occasion with some unusually interesting professional rem - iniscences in a late number of `` The Publishers ' Weekly . ''

		Mr.
Henry Holt	PERSON	, whose name on the '' Leisure Hour Series '' is familiar to novel-readers , as it is to science-readers on the '' American Science Series , '' and to naturalists on the '' American Nature Series , '' and to other wide circles of readers on the works of
Taine	LOCATION	, Mill ,
Maine	LOCATION	, ten Brink ,
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, and many other world-famous authors , relates how he -LRB- with abundant precedent and illus - trious example to encourage him -RRB- forsook law for literature at an early age and became a manufac - turer of books at the same time that he was , in a modest way , a writer of them .

		His authorship of two remarkably good novels , M Calmire , Man and Nature , '' and ''
Sturmsee	PERSON	, Man and Man , '' first issued anonymously , is now generally known .

		The rise of Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's publishing house , under its vari - ous designations , is an instructive history of the increasing success and reputation of a wisely and honorably conducted business .

		Naturally enough , Mr.
Holt	PERSON	dwells with fond retrospection upon the principles and policies of his earlier associates in publishing , and laments the competition and greed and questionable practices of these latter days , when the issuing of books is no longer the dignified profession it once was -- to the present detriment of all concerned . ''

		I suspect , '' he declares , M that whatever may be the case with the industrial and educational branches of publishing , the belles-lettres branch has got to be conducted as a profession , or there is no money in it .

		The old fortunes in the business were built up on this principle .

		Appar - ently the fine flavor of literature will not stand being dragged through the deeper mires of competi - tion . ''

		All will join in Mr.
Holt	PERSON	's hope that , despite his seventy years , he may '' continue in evidence some time longer '' in the trade which he has so long honored , and has done so much to elevate to the dignity of a profession .


William Everett	PERSON	, teacher , preacher , au - thor , lecturer , and publicist , the third son of
Edward Everett	PERSON	, whose gift of oratory he in a marked degree inherited , and best known as prin - cipal , for nearly thirty years , of the Adams Acad - emy at
Quincy	LOCATION	, died at his home in that '' city of presidents '' on the sixteenth of
February	DATE	, at the age of seventy .

		Educated at the
Boston Latin School	ORGANIZATION	,
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	,
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and at the
Dane Law School	ORGANIZATION	, and admitted to the bar as well as licensed to preach , Mr.
Everett	PERSON	's intel - lectual interests and his abilities were wide and varied .

		A tutorship in
Latin	LOCATION	at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	was soon succeeded by an assistant professorship , and this , in
1878	DATE	, by the principalship of the preparatory school which he made famous for its thorough and schol - arly work .

		His excursions into politics , including a term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, his spirited championship of the Mugwump cause , and his stalwart independence at all times and on all questions , are matters of record .

		What more nearly concerns us here are his fine Latin and Greek scholarship , his unexcelled mastery of his own language in both speaking and writing , and his contributions to literature , including his '' College Essays , '' `` On the Cam , '' and , for young readers , '' Double Play , '' '' Changing Base , '' and `` Thine , not Mine . ''

		His many courses of
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	lectures , notably his last year 's series on eighteenth-century British oratory , should not be forgotten .

		He is said to have finished , a short time before his death , a biography of his father , and also a book inspired by a vision of peace and war .

		It is to b e hoped that both works will soon appear in print .

		140 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	,
Poe	PERSON	's prospects of a place in the Hall of Fame of the
New York University	ORGANIZATION	are considerably brighter than they have been .

		Five years have passed since the failure , by nine votes , to inscribe his name in our American
Valhalla	LOCATION	; and sixteen vacancies have in the meantime been created and filled in the
Board of Electors	ORGANIZATION	, the present compo - sition of which is regarded as preponderatingly in
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's favor .

		Nominations of candidates for immor - tality are , by the rules , to be placed in the hands of these hundred electors on the first of
May	DATE	, and on the first of
October	DATE	the ballots will be cast .

		It would be passing strange if
Poe	PERSON	should again be voted down .

		To foreign observers , especially , it would be hardly short of scandalous .

		In a current article , of considerable weight , in the ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review , ''
Poe	PERSON	's genius is made the subject of a lengthy study . ''


Edgar Poe	PERSON	, World-Author , '' was the heading that Professor
Charles F. Richardson	PERSON	chose for the prefatory sketch to his late edition of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's complete works . ''

		Taking five representa - tive libraries of world-literature , '' he writes , as quoted in the Review , '' in English , German , and Italian ,
Poe	PERSON	's is the only name appearing in all five '' -- the only American name , we assume .

		And again : '' In many a little German , Austrian , or Italian bookshop , he stands as the sole representa - tive of the literature of his native land . ''

		Whether or not he chances to be among one 's personal favor - ites ,
Poe	PERSON	's fame and influence and enduring popu - larity are such as to render ridiculous any official attempt at a denial of his eminence .

		The books that are always out , when we apply for them at the public library , must be in some fortunate hands ; but in whose ?

		Library workers are familiar with the half-resentful , half - in credulous expression that comes over the applicant 's face when told for the ninth time that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's '' Marriage a la Mode , '' or Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's `` Peter '' is not in . ''

		Other people get what they want at the library ; I do n't see why I never can , '' murmurs the disappointed card-holder , as he finally makes the best of
Thackeray	PERSON	's `` Henry Esmond '' or Trollope 's '' Bar - chester Towers . ''

		A suspicion seems often to be cher - ished by the unsuccessful applicant for a recent and popular book that the desired work is maliciously kept from him , or is being read at leisure by the library trustees and employees before being put into general circulation ; or , not uncommonly , the library page is held guilty of carelessness in overlooking the book and of reporting it as out when it is really in .

		The
Leith Walk Library	ORGANIZATION	, in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, is one of the comparatively few present-day libraries that use the cumbersome '' indicator '' to inform applicants what books are available at any given moment -- at least among those most in demand .

		A recent visitor to this library was told that this bulky and antiquated piece of equipment is deemed necessary in
Scotland	LOCATION	because the Scotch are proverbially snspicious and demand some sort of ocular evidence that a coveted volume is actually not at hand .

		Many Bostonians will recall the blackboard-like indicator in use thirty -
five years ago	DATE	at the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and will remember the sinking of the heart which followed the discovery , in black , and not in white , of a number representing a longed-for book .

		A plea for true biography , made recently by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	before the members of the
London	LOCATION	Institution , deserves a place beside Pro- fessor
Hart	PERSON	's late address in favor of unfalsified history .

		One may not go all the way with Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	in his demand for naked truth in its every detail ; yet the fact remains that the greatest biog - raphy in the English language is noted for its unsparing , realistic treatment of its subject .

		Still , not all men are so interesting and so lovable in their little weaknesses and failings as Dr.
Samuel John	PERSON	- son , even supposing them to be attended by accur - ately observing and truth-telling Boswells .

		A few of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's own words will make clear his con - victions in this matter . ''

		I will even dare to say , '' he declares in regard to the biographer , `` that his anxiety should be , not to avoid indiscretion , but to be as indiscreet as possible , within the boundaries of good taste -LSB- but who shall fix those boundaries ?

		j and good feeling .

		He should start determined to reveal as far as possible , to drag the coy , retreating subject into the light of day . ''

		The speaker then referred to the conflicting motives , the wish to in - struct and the desire to amuse , the result being commonly that the subject is presented `` in a tight frock coat , with a glass of water in his hand and one elbow on a desk , in the act of preparing to say , * Ladies and gentlemen . ' ''

		Nevertheless even Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	would probably admit that much is now being written , in the shape of personal reminiscences of the great , that errs on the side of trivial detail .

		After all , the biographer , with the genuine gift of minutely faithful and at the same time grandly in - spiring biography , is born , not made .

		The solitariness of
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	is considered by some who have studied his character one of his most marked characteristics .

		It is a trite observation that the mountain heights attained by men of the loftiest genius are in an atmosphere too rarefied for ordinary mortals to breathe , and conse - quently this aloofness is necessarily common to all leaders in the realm of ideals .

		M.
Gerard Harry	PERSON	, in a recent volume devoted to the study of the famous mystic , finds in his aloofness the key that unlocks the man 's character and his work .

		He hesitates whether to ascribe this quality to '' the fear of being too unlike the majority of men to be understood by them , '' to '' the voluptuous sense of plenitude which the vision acquires at unfrequented altitudes , '' or to `` the instinctive repulsion which the parade and ostentation of the frivolous living of the period must inspire in one who explores the abyss too profoundly to be able to take seriously the agitated swarmings of the surface '' -- or , finally , to all three of these
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 141 probable causes .

		One need not , however , be a
Maeterlinck	PERSON	to appreciate the luxury of solitude and the calm delight of self-communing .

		Even so con - vivial a soul as Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	has left it on record that if he were forced to choose between eternal society and eternal solitude he would tell the jailer to turn the key and leave him alone .

		• • • The slow but sure progress of the
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	is brought to our notice by the appear - ance , at irregular intervals , of a new volume .

		Dr.
Murray	PERSON	's great work , the greatest ever undertaken in English lexicography , has now advanced , in its seventh volume , to the end of the letter P , and hopes are entertained that Q and R will be disposed of in the present year .

		Thus there is good ground for expecting that men now living will see the comple - tion of this scholarly and useful publication .

		But -LRB- melancholy thought -RRB- the dictionary of a living lan - guage , like the catalogue of a growing library , is no sooner published than it is out of date -- a disability that becomes more serious with every passing day .

		Among the more interesting entries under P in the
Oxford Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	is the word '' psychological , '' especially as used in the expression , `` the psycho - logical moment , '' now conceded to be a blundering translation , or application , of the German das psy - chologische moment -LRB- that is , the psychological mo - mentum , or impulse -RRB- .

		It is probable , however , that in defiance of logic '' the psychological moment , '' like '' the personal equation , '' will continue to enjoy an undeserved reputation for peculiar aptness and force .

		The metrical instinct , the impulse to express oneself in verse rather than in prose , is almost a primitive instinct , manifesting itself in all literatures before the development of a prose style .

		It is natural , therefore , that many of the crude attempts , both printed and unprinted , of ambitious young people to achieve the dignity of authorship should take -LRB- or endeavor to take -RRB- metrical form .

		But the reader of these zealous efforts must often wonder what the writers ' notions of rhyme and metre really are , or whether they consciously possess any such notions .

		The
Sunday	DATE	issue of a metropolitan news - paper which is indulgent toward embryonic poets lately printed on a single page ten of these amateur effusions in verse -- or in what bore the outward appearance of verse .

		The first of them , under the promising title , '' Glorified `` by Love , '' canters along briskly for a line or two , then abruptly halts , then breaks into a walk , alternating gaits in a bone - shaking fashion throughout .

		The first line runs , not unglibly : '' Today as I was passing through the busy scenes of town '' -- a good , swinging metre ; but before the end of the second line is reached -LRB- '' I saw an humble mendicant , crouching , head bowed down '' -RRB- the rhythm disappointingly halts , though the rhyme is irreproachable .

		A little further on , however , the poet suffers ignominious defeat in both particulars .

		A sufficiently fluent line , '' But as I stood condemned , yet weak , unable to give help , '' is thus feebly supported : `` Two brothers stalked across my path -- they in duty forgot self . ''

		Do verse-endings such as these , we wonder , answer each other 's call for help -- in the writer 's mind ?

		It is an amusing study , that page of would-be poetry by contemporary authors not yet famous , and it dis - plays prodigious zeal , whatever its deficiency of knowledge .

		The finality of first impressions in the book - world , commercially considered , is a rule proved by some conspicuous exceptions .

		Edward
FitzGerald	PERSON	's '' Omar '' languished in the market for years , with almost no sales , and had suffered the indignity of being marked down to a penny in the
London	LOCATION	book - stalls when a discerning eye caught sight of it , and an appreciative word gave it a wide vogue .


Lew Wallace	PERSON	's '' Ben-Hur '' did not at first find popular favor , only twenty-five hundred copies being sold in two years .

		Then the tide turned , for some reason , in its favor , and it made a record for large sales .

		The appearance of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's pamphlet , '' Why I Wrote ■ The White Prophet , ' '' after it had become painfully evident that book-buyers were not jostling one another to secure copies of the
Manxman	PERSON	's new novel , moves one to doubt whether the author has acted with either professional dig - nity or commercial wisdom .

		Qui s ` excuse s ` accuse .

		If the novel shows deficient vitality on the market , no amount of explanation why it should be ac - counted a memorable production will breathe into it the breath of life .

		The best-housed amateur journal in the world may safely be pronounced to be the `` Har - vard Lampoon , '' which has just moved into its new forty-thousand-dollar building at the corner of
Mt. Auburn	ORGANIZATION	and Bow streets , the dedication of which was celebrated with a grand gathering of former '' Lampoon '' editors and other dignitaries , including Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	, also an ex-Lampoonist , who addressed the assembly informally .

		The '' Lampoon '' dates from
1876	DATE	; and it is one of its founders , Mr.
Edmund M. Wheelwright	PERSON	, of the class of '76 and now practising architecture in
Boston	LOCATION	, who designed and supervised the erection of the new building .

		Foreign countries have been drawn upon for ornamental finishings to the handsome interior -- including rare and costly furniture from
Holland	LOCATION	, an Elizabethan mantelpiece from
England	LOCATION	, leaded glass windows from
Belgium	LOCATION	, and tiles from
Delft	LOCATION	.

		Material comfort and aesthetic satisfaction have both been kept in mind in fitting up these quarters for future generations of Lampoonists .

		Long may this piquant representative of college wit live to excite the mirth of its readers !

		• • • The shifting sands of orthoepy are so very unstable that it might almost be questioned whether there is , after all , any such science .

		The other day in
London	LOCATION	a lecturer before the Elizabethan Society dwelt on the not universally understood fact that our 142 THE DIAJL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, pronunciation is changing so rapidly that , were Shake - speare now alive , he would probably be unable to understand one of his own plays as presented on the modern stage .

		In illustration of this ceaseless change -- a change that reveals itself in the rhymed verses of our poets of various periods -- the lecturer adduced the word '' time , '' whose pronunciation in Chaucer 's day he represented by the spelling '' teem , '' , in Shake - speare 's by the spelling `` tame , '' and in modern cock - ney by `` toime . ''

		Instruction in English at school tends to hold cockneyisms in check , and acts un - doubtedly as a beneficent hindrance to all erratic tendencies in pronounciation .

		But no living lan - guage will ever crystallize into rigid and changeless forms , whether in grammar or spelling or mode of utterance .

		Hence the folly of hoping for a perman - ently satisfactory scheme of phonetic spelling .

		A library for printers , erected by printers , is a sort of standing refutation of the time-honored saying that the shoemaker 's children go barefoot and the tailor 's family dresses in rags .

		The Printers ' Home at
Colorado Springs	LOCATION	, founded and maintained by the
Union Printers of America	ORGANIZATION	, has just made a
$ 30,000	MONEY	addition to its fine buildings , in the shape of a library to house its excellent collection of books , about 11,000 in number .

		It is proposed to make it eventually far more attractive and home-like than the usual public library .

		The main building of the Printers ' Home was dedicated in
1892	DATE	, and the property , including extensive subsequent additions , is now valued at a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		COMM UNICA TIONS .

		THE '' BEST SELLER '' AND THE GENTEEL ATMOSPHERE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		When will there arise an author of popular fiction courageous enough to come forward and reveal his formula ?

		It is quite patent on the very cover of every successful novel , and so unvarying that it is with diffi - culty one distinguishes a season 's books apart ; yet the writers wink at each other , so to speak , and seem to imagine it a secure professional secret .

		One might have looked for some such disclosure among '' The Confessions of a Best Seller '' in a recent number of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' ; but whoever did so was disappointed .

		This anonymous author , like the rest of his craft , would have us believe that the '' best seller '' sells because of its absorbing plot interest .

		It must be a tale of incident , he tells us , which by reason of its plunging melodrama -- lost messages , fights on the stairs , etc. -- can give the tired business man an evening of self-forgetfulness .

		What a slanderous absurdity !

		This may be the com - pelling force in paper-covered '' Diamond Dicks , '' but the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' contributor describes his novels as sell - ing at a dollar and
eighteen cents	MONEY	; and to accuse popular fiction at this price of real plot interest , is calumny .

		As if the American people were of so purposeless and extrav - agant a temperament that they would pay
millions of dollars	MONEY	a year merely to be entertained !

		No , we are of more serious stock ; and the people who buy new books -- not tired business men , but women mostly -- are after something more than a good story , and are willing to pay for it ; and that something is -- the genteel atmo - sphere .

		The genteel atmosphere !

		Who ever saw a '' best seller '' with a suggestion of anything so vulgar as pov - erty , -- with a heroine who makes her own shirt-waists , and a hero noble and handsome but a little short of money !

		How disgusting !

		Such books have been written , it is true , and have taken a high rank in literature ; but they are not used for window displays in the depart - ment stores of our time .

		No , the love scenes in your popular novel must take place in a gondola in
Venice	LOCATION	, and there must be a familiarity with expensive cafe 's , and rare curios , and Italian phrases ; and by all means let there be no mention of locomotion other than in automobiles -- at least until aeroplanes become more plausible .

		Why is all this ?

		It is self-evident .

		We can not all go to
Europe	LOCATION	, or keep a coachman ; and hence -- the '' best seller . ''

		One must somehow acquire the genteel atmosphere .

		But it may be objected that books which reproduce aristocratic society most faithfully are often not popu - lar ; and again , the atmosphere of the successful novel is frequently not one of gentility at all .

		People of good breeding do not act and talk as these characters do .

		True ; and I have used the term merely in a technical sense .

		For the genteel atmosphere of the '' best seller '' is a thing by itself , whose actual counterpart does not exist in heaven or on earth .

		Yet it is in the creation of this atmosphere that the author proves himself , not a clever story-teller only , but a genius .

		Such a book is based upon psychology , not fact .

		Its requisites are two : first , that the setting be unquestionably fashion - able ; second , that the characters be dressed in all the trappings and suits of affluence , but underneath they shall be not such people as one really finds in well-bred society , but -- the readers themselves .

		Otherwise your genteel atmosphere will be dull and incomprehensible to the bulk of your audience .

		What we , the buyers of '' best sellers , '' want is not to stand and stare at an alien and to us stupid group of men and women .

		We want to have the rosy Utopia of wealth and ease presented in such a way that we can feel it -- can imagine ourselves in the midst of it and a part of it .

		And to this end it is absolutely essential that the characters be at bottom very like ourselves .

		We want to be lifted gently , so that we do not feel the jar , from our vulgarly crowded street-car bench to the luxu - rious motor-car on its tour through
France	LOCATION	.

		We do not want to stand on the bank and watch the gondola , but to be in it ourselves , -- to have the people there say and do the things that we imagine we should say and do if we found ourselves in a gondola .

		When your neighbor presses upon you the latest book , her enthusiastic recommendation is sure to be accom - panied by the apology , '' There is n't much to the story , you know ; it 's the way it is told . ''

		Of course it is .

		Away with your claims of plot interest !

		And by '' the way it is told '' she means that she has wiped the dish - water from her hands -- not knowing that there may be more real gentility in dishwater than in a bunch of orchids -- and has sat down to a delicious hour of '' good society . ''

		She has covertly made note of carelessly dropped references to the opera and to out-of-the-way spots in
Switzerland	LOCATION	-LRB- they may embellish her conversa - tion later -RRB- , and has laughed with the author over the inappropriateness of a hostess serving Burgundy with
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 fish .

		She -- the reader -- never serves Burgundy with anything ; but the author does not suspect that .

		For indeed the best part of it all is the delightful way in which he takes you into his confidence and chats non - chalantly about elegant things , -- never being so com - monplace as to suggest that you know there are people who do not ride in automobiles and go to
Europe	LOCATION	every year .

		Oh , it is exquisite , this bath of gentility ; and the thing that makes it so is the fact that your neighbor really feels herself a part of it , -- because the heroine is , after all , just such a person as she herself might be with the addition of a Worth gown to her wardrobe , a title to her name , and a few French phrases to her vocabulary .

		The author who can make this delicate connection most adroitly is the one who gets the most money for his books ; he who can reduce the life of '' smart '' society just to the plane where it will touch the imagi - nation of the uninitiated while still floating tantalizingly above their reach .

		After all , is it such a mean service ?

		It affords a deal of comfort in a cold and unfair world ; and if the instinct to imitate one 's betters is snobbish and
Philistine	LOCATION	, so are some of the instincts on the part of the betters themselves .

		But thus it is that we have books sparkling with unbelievably trite quotations , and repartee that would cause nausea iu a half-way good conversationalist ; this is why we have duchesses flirting in a manner that would be charming in a shop-girl , and bishops -LRB- figura - tively speaking -RRB- with their hats on one side of their heads .

		This is why it is , in short , that the windows of our department stores are full of '' best sellers '' decor - ated with a portrait of the heiress in an evening gown -- neat little packages of genteel atmosphere at a dollar and
eighteen cents	MONEY	, and cheap at the price ; and why our popular novelist pockets his prodigious royalties for being , not a story-writer , but a shrewd psychologist .

		A REPRODUCTION OF THE CAEDMON MS. -LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Professor
John M. Manly	PERSON	, during his recent visit to
England	LOCATION	, made arrangements with the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	for the reproduction in facsimile of the Caedmon manucript in the Bodleian Library .

		The manuscript consists of 260 large pages , and is of especial interest , not only on account of the importance of the text and the very remarkable illustrations , but because of the system of metrical points , which can not be studied to advantage without exact reproduction .

		The
University Press	ORGANIZATION	have agreed to issue a collotype to subscribers at five guineas net ; only one hundred copies will be pub - lished , and it is likely that the reproduction will increase in value with the lapse of time .

		In cooperation with Professor Manly and Professor
G. L. Kittredge	PERSON	, I brought the undertaking before the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	at the
East	LOCATION	- ern meeting at
Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	; a resolution was unanimously passed commending the enterprise to American scholars and university libraries , and request - ing the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the
Reproduction of Early Texts	ORGANIZATION	to make preliminary arrangements for publication .

		In accordance with this resolution , I am now issuing a circular with a form of subscription attached , which I shall be glad to send to anyone interested .

		Applica - tions will be filed in the order in which they are received , and the subscription list will be closed as soon as one hundred names are registered Although no general appeal has yet been made , I have already between twenty and thirty names on the subscription list .

		A QUESTION OF TYPOGRAPHY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I have often felt a vague dissatisfaction at reaching the end of a page of poetry and finding nothing to indi - cate whether the last line on the page was the conclud - ing line of a stanza or the stanza was carried over to the next page .

		The feeling ceased to be a vague one the other day , when , reading a narrative poem with blank-verse stanzas of different lengths , I found the meaning obscured by uncertainty as to whether the completion of the page coincided with the completion of a thought , or the same stanza was continued when I turned the page .

		The current practice is unpleasant ; if , as I have discovered , it may at times be confusing , why should not a different one be adopted ?

		It has occurred to me that a sufficient distinction is made by leaving the earlier page one or two lines shorter when the stanza is completed there , and by beginning a new stanza the same number of lines lower on the following page .

		This arrangement would be especially clear in books that are printed with marginal lines enclosing the text .

		An artist friend suggests that such pages are hopelessly inartistic ; but I am unable to see why the addition of this irregularity to the unequal length of line , and the prevalent practice of allowing stanzas to come differently on opposite pages , will detract from the appearance of the book .

		Perhaps a more effective contrivance would be the placing of a conventional symbol at the end of each stanza .

		We are not satisfied with a double space at the end of a sentence , but use a period .

		We distinguish broken words from completed words at the end of a line by a hyphen .

		We should in the same way find some means of distinguishing a broken stanza from a completed one at the end of a page .

Fifteen Years of Diplomatic Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The names Bunsen and
Waddington	PERSON	are familiar to those versed in the history of
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean diplomacy , and they are far from unfamiliar in the world of learning and literature .

		Madame
Charles de Bunsen	PERSON	, whose recollections of her early public life have just been published under the title '' In Three Legations , '' is by birth a
Waddington	LOCATION	-- being , in fact , the sister of the late
William Henry Waddington	PERSON	, scholar and writer as well as diplomat and statesman ; and her husband ,
Carl von Bunsen	PERSON	, for years in the Prussian diplomatic service , was the son of the famous
Baron von Bunsen	PERSON	, whose varied learn - ing , contributions to philology and history , and distinguished services as representative of his country at various courts , are not yet quite for - gotten .

		In
Madame Waddington	PERSON	's two excellent volumes of reminiscences , which were reviewed in these pages at the time of their publication , the Bunsens are frequently mentioned ; and so the way has been paved , if it needed paving , for these retrospections of her sister-in-law .

		The book is made up of extracts from letters '' written on the spot '' and needing no assurance on the writer 's part that they are spontaneous , sincere , and the genuine records of passing im - pressions .

		A small part of the correspondence has appeared in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' but all the rest is new .

		The '' three legations '' referred to in the title are the Prussian Legations at
Turin	LOCATION	, at
Florence	LOCATION	-LRB- when in
1864	DATE	the Tuscan city superseded her Piedmontese sister as capital of the growing Italian kingdom -RRB- , and at The
Hague	LOCATION	; and the time covered is from
1857	DATE	to
1872	DATE	.

		At
Turin	LOCATION	, Bunsen was Secretary of Legation , at
Florence Conseiller de Legation	ORGANIZATION	, and at The Hague he acted as Minister in the temporary absence of Count Perponcher .

		It was an eventful period in European history , covering three memorable wars and witnessing considerable changes in the geography and the political constitution of several countries . ''

		Curiously enough , '' says the author in her preface , '' in each of our ' Three Legations ' we lived through the experience of a war , and were present at a royal marriage . ''

		Actual attendance at these nuptials , however , is recorded in only one instance , that of the union of the Prince of
Wied	ORGANIZATION	with
Princess Marie	PERSON	of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, * In Three Legations .

Madame Charles de Bunsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		With 49 illustrations .

		New York :
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		in the
summer of 1871	DATE	, at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the other two weddings , that of Princess
Marie Pia	PERSON	of
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	and
King Louis	LOCATION	of
Portugal	LOCATION	, and the marriage of
Prince Umberto	LOCATION	to
Margherita of Savoy	ORGANIZATION	, the writer gives short and second-hand accounts .

		The three wars were the brief clash between
Austria	LOCATION	on one side and
Italy	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	on the other , in
1859	DATE	; the short war of
1866	DATE	, which freed
Venice	LOCATION	from Austrian rule and greatly increased the might and prestige of
Prussia	LOCATION	; and the Franco-German war of
1870	DATE	.


Madame de Bunsen	ORGANIZATION	's pages fairly bristle with the names of royalties and other hohe
Herrschaften	PERSON	, as was to to be expected .

		A glimpse of Cavour at one of his receptions is obtained on an early page . ''

		Cavour was doing the honors very amiably in a much embroidered coat .

		His round good-natured face and spectacles , as well as his short stout figure , always seem to me slightly disappointing .

		It does not answer , somehow , to one 's idea of a great Italian statesman .

		He always makes me most gracious bows , however , whenever I meet him in the street , which I do fre - quently , as we do not live far from the Palais Cavour . ''

		The King -LRB-
Victor Emanuel	PERSON	II . -RRB-

		she describes as rather fierce in appearance , and not hand - some , though better-looking than his portraits ; and she pays high tribute to his bravery in the war with
Austria	LOCATION	. ''

		The King exposes himself dreadfully , '' she writes . ''

		His entourage say it is just like the time of
Charles Albert	PERSON	, only that the latter used to take his whole etat major with him , and
Victor Emanuel	PERSON	only has a few officers . ''

		The following , written at
Turin	LOCATION	in the
spring of 1861	DATE	, gives an interesting picture of
Garibaldi	PERSON	and other leaders of
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		I went to the famous sitting of the
Chambers Satur	ORGANIZATION	- day last -LSB- when the question of incorporating
Garibaldi	PERSON	's volunteers with the regular army was animatedly dis - cussed -RSB- , stood for four hours , saw and heard
Garibaldi	PERSON	,
Ricasoli	PERSON	,
Cavour	PERSON	,
Bixio	LOCATION	,
Crispi	ORGANIZATION	, etc. ... Soon
Garibaldi	PERSON	came in , leaning on two friends , who sat down after - wards one on each side of him .

		He suffers from rheu - matism , and is very lame .

		As you know , it was the first time he took his seat in the Chamber , and he was received with great applause , all the deputies rising .

		He is exactly like his portraits , with fine , regular fea - tures , which tell well at a distance .

		He was dressed in a red shirt , of course , over which he had a grey cloak falling in picturesque folds ; his whole appearance was somewhat theatrical .

		... He has a splendid voice , which filled the whole chamber , and speaks slowly , but not without eloquence .

		He did not get on far , however , before the excitement began , and when he came to the guerra fratricida ,
Cavour	PERSON	jumped up as if he was stung , and , thumping on the green table at which the Ministers sit , declared that such language he could not and would not hear !

		Whereupon
Garibaldi	PERSON	repeated the expression over again .

		The effect was tremendous ; all the deputies left their seats , crowding down to the centre , all talk -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTAh 145 ing , screaming , and gesticulating at once .

		The public tribunes , which were full of red shirts , applauded .

		The President put on his hat .

		Such a scene I had never witnessed . ''

		Among the writers noteworthy experiences at
Turin	LOCATION	was a visit to the
Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	, where the public reading-room was well filled with readers and the atmosphere correspondingly rich in carbonic acid ; accordingly the obsequious Prefetto invited his distinguished visitors into the private reading-room and laid before them all sorts of manuscript treasures and a splendid copy of Dante illustrated by Dore .

		More than that , a priceless old book of designs for point lace , dated
1587	DATE	, was placed in
Madame	ORGANIZATION	's hands , and she was allowed to take it home with her , coupled with the assurance that the library books were honored by her perusal , that the
University	ORGANIZATION	was too happy to be agreeable to her , and more in the same strain of overdone politeness .

		From the writer 's account of her life at
Florence	LOCATION	, extending from
1864	DATE	to
1869	DATE	, we quote a paragraph from a letter written in the eventful but anxious
summer of 1866	DATE	.

		■ The news of the last great Prussian victory -LRB- Sa - dowa -RRB- has arrived .

		The Legation is all imbandierata -LRB- beflagged -RRB- , the Sindaco of
Florence	LOCATION	came to congratu - late officially , and ... C. had to receive him .

		All our gentlemen were ' walking on their heads with joy ' -- at least that was Mine .

		d'Usedom 's description of them when she came in the afternoon .

		In the evening we went up to
Villa Capponi	LOCATION	, where many people had come to congratulate , and where all was very festive .

		It is pathetic to hear the people about us inquiring as the news of one Prussian victory after another comes , ' Non c ' e niente per noi ? '

		-LRB- Is there nothing for us ? -RRB-

		Poor things , they have given all so freely -- their blood , their money , and their lives .

		It is heartrending to think it should all have been of so little avail , and that the honourable defeat at Custozza is the only result . ''

		Life at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	was apparently less lively for the Bunsens than in the cities of sunny
Italy	LOCATION	.

		At one time , when all the men were gone to the frontier , as the author says , to guard the neutrality , it was especially unstimulating to the ladies .

		Relations with the French Legation were of course -LRB- in
1870	DATE	-RRB- a little strained . ''

		We do not visit , '' writes
Madame de Bunsen	ORGANIZATION	, `` but we bow and shake hands , and even speak occa - sionally . ''

		The royal wedding of the following
summer	DATE	must have been an agreeable distrac - tion , though the absurdly long and solemn wed - ding sermon was a weariness .

		Among other details we read : '' The ladies who bore the train , as generally all the women present , were dressed in shades of lilac , and the whole effect was soft and pretty .

		The service com - menced by singing , and then the clergyman of Wasse - naar ... began an address from the pulpit .

		It is a very high one in Dutch fashion , with an immense sounding-board which seemed almost to extinguish him .

		I hardly understood a word , I am sorry to say , except every now and then the name of
Nassau Oranien	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was fearfully long , moreover , more than half an hour by the clock over the organ opposite him , and , as we heard afterwards , made many sad allusions to the recent death of the bride 's mother .

		He was quite in the wrong , for the programme said explicitly ' en korte trourede ' -LRB- a short nuptial address -RRB- .

		The Princess
Marie	PERSON	grew paler and paler , the
King	PERSON	fidgeted and spoke to the Queen , who shrugged her shoulders .

		Prince
Frederick	PERSON	turned to the Hof-Marschall , Count Lim - burg
Stirum	PERSON	, who stood behind him , and evidently told him it was too long .

		Limburg Stirum gesticulated and tried to catch the preacher 's eye .

		He signalled to the chambellan on the other side , and they both took out their watches and held them up , but all was of no avail .

		Secure in his serene attitude , his '
Welerwaarden	PERSON	' went ever on , one high-sounding phrase succeeding another in a sort of cantilena , with
Nassau Oranien	PERSON	, and
Luise Henriette	PERSON	, the great
Kurfurstin	PERSON	, as the burthen of bis song . ''

		The narrative closes with the retirement of the writer 's husband from the diplomatic ser - vice , in
July , 1872	DATE	, and the
Bunsens	PERSON	' withdrawal to their estate of Mein Geniigen in the
Rhein	LOCATION	- land .

		Madame de Bunsen has , with her pleasant and well-written volume , enrolled herself among the clever and interesting diplomats ' wives who , from the day of Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	down to our own time , have brightly and briskly pictured the scenes of diplomatic life in the gay capitals of the Old World .

		She shows , for a French-born person , or for an English woman either , an admirable command of simple and effective English ; in fact , most of the slips noticeable in her pages are , curiously enough , in her own French , which is introduced for a phrase or two now and then .

		For example , she makes the crowd cry `` Vive les Francais ! ''

		when the French troops enter
Turin	LOCATION	-- as if any such violation of grammar could be detected by the ear .

		Her very first page has a slight error of chronology ,
1858	DATE	being put instead of
1857	DATE	as the year of her arrival at
Turin	LOCATION	.

		The por - traits in the volume are many , and , being chiefly of celebrities whom she met , are well worthy of insertion .

		There are also various other illus - trations .

		It is , on the whole , as agreeable a book of the sort as has appeared since her sister-in-law ,
Madame Waddington	PERSON	, entertained us with her graphic descriptions of official life at the courts of
St. Petersburg	ORGANIZATION	and
London	LOCATION	.

		146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, A New Narrative of the
American Revolutiox	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The fifth and sixth volumes of Mr.
Avery	PERSON	's most interesting '' History of the
United States	LOCATION	and Its People '' are now before the public ; and although their general merit alone must have commended them to its attention , certain fea - tures call for especial emphasis .

		The volumes cover the Pre-Revolutionary and Revolutionary epochs , and furnish , on the whole , a really excellent account of the contest between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and her thirteen
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard colonies .

		They show how the basis of the con - test lay in the reassertion of royal prerogative , in the adherence to worn-out political contri - vances , and more than all else in the adoption of an imperial policy by the British government .

		In certain respects , however , they are a trifle disappointing ; for they lay no great stress -- as to be up to date they should -- upon the essen - tially civil-war nature of the struggle , or upon the fact that other British colonies had their influence upon events as well as those that were primarily English in origin .

		Moreover , they ignore the great subject of parliamentary development in
England	LOCATION	, place undue weight upon such controverted matters as the projected introduction of episcopacy into
New England	LOCATION	, and quite frequently lose sight of salient facts and principles in an unworthy attempt to bring places , incidents , and persons , obscure and unim - portant , into strong relief .

		This last-mentioned feature is all the more deplorable because , unfor - tunately for our national dignity , there is already too much of that sort of thing in
America	LOCATION	-- too much of a tendency to exaggerate , for purely family reasons , the little doings of little men .

		A word or two should be said here about the illustrative material of Mr.
Avery	PERSON	's work .

		Here - tofore this has been good , sometimes pointedly so .

		But in these later volumes author and publishers have seen fit to intersperse , among things of great value , things intrinsically valueless and foolishly expensive , -- as , for instance , coats-of - arms , pictures of buildings now easily accessible to view on the souvenir post-card , and odds and ends of things that can be found in abundance in '' Headquarters , '' in '' Mansions , '' and in the museums of
State	ORGANIZATION	historical societies .

		As a matter of principle and of respect for tradition , the greatest objection is to be made to the inser - * A History of the
United States	LOCATION	and its People .

		By
Elroy McKendree Avery	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volume V. , The Colonies : 1764-1775 ; The Revolution to the Declaration of Independ - ence .

		tion of coats-of-arms .

		We have thirteen of them in these two volumes .

		Now heraldic devices of all sorts belong to mediaevalism .

		They have no place in American history .

		They are radically un-American , and the ideas underlying them are opposed to everything that is fundamental , and even sacred , in the origin of this government .

		Especially do they seem out of place in a history of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	, in a book that , in grandiloquent phrase , tells the story of a supreme struggle for individualism .

		Family pride in heroic deed , in intellectual achievement , or in nobility of character , is one thing ; that in priority of emi - gration or of descent , in the face of uncertain and incomplete records , to say nothing of fraud and of distraint of knighthood , is quite another .

		Among the really valuable , or at least inter - esting , illustrations are various handbills , broad - sides , and portraits , plans of battles and for - tifications , caricatures , the French map of the
United States	LOCATION	in
1778	DATE	, the map of the proposed new States in the West , maps bearing upon boundary disputes , and maps depicting military movements .

		All these are eminently appro - priate in a sober historical work , as is also the Plat of the
Seven Ranges of Townships	ORGANIZATION	in the
Ohio	LOCATION	Survey of 1785-1787 .

		There are a few places where remarks have been based upon , or may lead to , misconcep - tions .

		Take for example the words on page 196 of Volume V. , relative to the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Judiciary Act .

		Remembering , as we must , that the Act was intended to protect from injustice revenue collectors and the like who might hap - pen to get into trouble when in discharge of their duties , we are puzzled to know how a change of venue would necessarily mean convic - tion .

		Again , on page 198 , in dealing with the
Quebec	LOCATION	Act , the author ought to have made his readers understand that
Great Britain	LOCATION	, in recog - nizing the Roman Catholic religion among the French inhabitants of
Canada	LOCATION	, was acting in strict accordance with a treaty stipulation .

		The laudatory remarks oh pages 239 and 240 are decidedly misleading , inasmuch as no original text of
Patrick Henry	ORGANIZATION	's speech exists , and our only knowledge of it rests upon what his biogra - pher did years afterwards when he put together passages that certain old men thought they re - membered the famous Virginian to have uttered .

		The bibliographies of the fifth and sixth vol - umes are full and well-selected .

		There are , however , a few regrettable omissions and a few unnecessary inclusions .

		Mrs.
Gadsby	PERSON	's article on '' The
Harford County Declaration	ORGANIZATION	of Inde - pendence '' is worthless historically , and may do
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 positive harm if recommended along with the scholarly works of Friedenwald ,
Van Tyne	LOCATION	, and many others of high rank .

		To speak of a local intention to carry out the object of the
Associa	LOCATION	- tion , which was virtually non-commercial inter - course with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, as a declaration of independence , shows a lamentable ignorance of historical situations , and is as absurd as to speak of the secession of
Jones County	LOCATION	,
Mississippi	LOCATION	, just prior to the Civil War .

		Generally , how - ever , Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has indicated the historical value of a certain book in a few well-chosen remarks .

		Sometimes he has , most conveniently for the investigator , grouped the various authori - ties on a particular subject , and sometimes he has both grouped and compared them .

		Among subjects that have received remark - ably judicious handling from Mr.
Avery	PERSON	are the treatment of prisoners of war and the treatment of the loyalists ; also the participation of the negro in the Revolution .

		One might wish that some other side than the military had been em - phasized : but Mr.
Avery	PERSON	chose to follow the beaten track , and we have yet to wait for some work based upon investigations into the sociolog - ical and economic conditions that accompanied or resulted from the struggle for independence .

		We are glad to have so able a discussion as Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has given us of the early westward move - ment , of the national embarrassments under the Articles of Confederation , and of the perplex - ities that confronted the framers of the new Con - stitution .

		Altogether , he has given us a highly creditable piece of historical work ; and we can frankly say that the points for adverse criti - cism , quite serious though they are , are almost obscured by the very number and magnitude of those deserving commendation .

		We can also repeat that the publication as a whole promises to supply a long - felt want .

		It can be perused with profit by both the professional historian and the ordinary reader : for in suggestiveness , in general accuracy , and in broadness of view , its rank is un - questionably high .

		* As an intimate account of a man of genius written by a life-long friend ,

		illumination of some of the dark corners of the poet 's strange , sordid , tragic career , constitute the main claims of the book on our suffrance .

		In one way , it is a very peculiar work .

		Avowedly written by a sympathetic comrade in - spired by the motive of vindicating
Verlaine	PERSON	and setting him in a better light than have the more or less apocryphal stories circulated before and since his death , it manages to leave a picture of this child of the Parisian gutter more disgusting than was in the imagination before .

		So vivid is this impression that at times one almost won - ders if the author 's purpose be not , under the guise of friendship , to paint his subject in the darkest colors .

		Yet in reading the words of M. Lepelletier at
Verlaine	LOCATION	's funeral , one can not but believe that this is an untenable assumption ; that his subject , rather , was too much for him ; so that , somewhat naively , he damns where he would fain praise .

		There is something terrible in the spectacle of a friend exposing , with good intentions , the essential evil behavior of one of the world 's most gifted degenerates .

		A dipsomaniac , a lecher , a liar , a prison-bird , and a megalomaniac , -- these be hard terms ; yet , to be truthful , they apply to this man who has written some of the most musical and most subtly spiritual poetry in the whole range of French song .

		The plain fact is , that
Paul Ver	PERSON	- laine was untrustworthy in all the fundamental relations of life : to friends , to wife , to mother , -- even to his art , since a portion of his writings is a foul libel upon it .

		That this biographer can eulogize him as much as he does , implies a questionable standard quite as much as it does the bias of friendship .

		The attempt to white - wash
Verlaine	PERSON	's relation to that other poet - degenerate ,
Arthur Rimbaud	PERSON	, is not particularly convincing , although the reader will be glad enough to give such a man as
Verlaine	PERSON	the benefit of any doubt in his favor .

		One is glad , too , freely to acknowledge that in certain parts of his passion-tossed existence something better was aroused in him and a higher nature spoke ; as where , in the enforced regimen of a jail , some of his finest religious verse was produced ; or when he lived quietly in rural
England	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	as a school-teacher , and made a good impression on those who met him , because he was removed from the vicious city haunts which always dragged him down .

		But there was never real reform , essential regeneration ; as the biogra - pher admits ,
Verlaine	PERSON	's conversion was always '' literary . ''

		The work -LRB- which , by the way , is but indif - ferently Englished -RRB- has considerable interest in 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, its pictures of the literary and art life of
Paris	LOCATION	during the last generation and down to the present : for example , the group of poets known as the Parnassians , of whom were both
Verlaine	PERSON	and his biographer , and the Symbolists who followed , are described with piquant particu - larity .

		The study is also rich in pictorial ma - terial , including some interesting presentments of the satyr-poet from the age of two till he lay dead in a wretched garret ; as well as members of his family and the author of the book .

		But when all is said , one can but come back in sad wonderment to the poet 's own words : '' Let Lepelletier defend my reputation .

		He is able to clear what will soon be my memory .

		I rely upon him to make me known as I was in reality , when I am no longer here . ''

		Alas , that a friend could do no more !

		Alas , that
Verlaine	PERSON	could not have assisted him by furnishing a better life-story !

		There is no epoch of history more stirring and fascinating than the

		Filled with that astounding confidence in his divine mission and his personal importance which was part of his very being ,

Europe	LOCATION	.

		Strange to say , this * The Bourbon Restoration .

		manoeuvre did not make the slighted guest his mortal enemy , -- as did a somewhat similar indis - cretion , the snubbing of
Madame Ney	ORGANIZATION	by the Duchesse d'Angouleme , which slight is said to have been largely responsible for
Ney	ORGANIZATION	's desertion of the Royalists when
Napoleon	PERSON	returned .

		The Comte d'Artois had agreed to certain conditions in
Louis	LOCATION	's name before
Louis	PERSON	's appearance , and when the new King assumed his crown he calmly ignored them .

		Similar tactics , by d'Artois him - self as
Charles X.	PERSON	, a few years later , ended the Bourbon rule forever .


Ferrand	PERSON	's impassioned defense of the emigres before the
Chambres	LOCATION	, at a time when the emigres '' had nothing to do with the case , '' roused a feeling against them that predisposed the dissatisfied country in favor of the returning Emperor .

		The regulation prohib - iting labor on
Sunday	DATE	, passed in
1814	DATE	, will serve as an example of numerous laws which were ostentatiously passed and then quietly ignored .

		Constant ,
Ney	ORGANIZATION	,
Davout	PERSON	,
Fouche	PERSON	, the leading men of the state , made oaths and broke them with what would seem most injudicious frequency .

		A mistake of
$ 3,000,000	MONEY	in the computation of the indemnity due the Allies would have lost
France	LOCATION	that amount , if the English banking-house , which had the matter in charge , had not gener - ously pointed out the error . ''

		It would appear , '' was the disgusted comment of
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	, the shrewdest statesman of the generation , '' as though your affairs were managed by cornets of hussars . ''

		Louis XVIII .

		himself , though gouty and pro- saic , -- much less of an aristocrat than the name - less upstart
Napoleon	PERSON	, -- was neither fool nor knave .

		He had no sympathy with the insane party-feeling of the emigres , and he made an honest effort to govern well .

		A modern expo - nent of the omnipotence of mind might find in his calm confidence in ultimate success an agency which promoted the Restoration .

		If he was too dependent on the advice of others , he could easily have found a less able and less honest favorite than Decazes among the intriguers that sur - rounded him .

		His insistence that '' a King of
France	LOCATION	might die , but must never be ill , '' and his struggle to hold audiences and attend to his work while he was literally dying , is pathetic and heroic .

		One feels a genuine relief that the obstinate old doctrinaire did not live fa see the downfall of the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is less to be said for
Charles X	ORGANIZATION	.

		As the Comte d'Artois , he had been one of his brother 's most turbulent and troublesome sub - jects , and his reign is a series of arbitrary acts , culminating in the terrible mistake of
July , 1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 149

Philippe Egalite	LOCATION	,
Louis Duke of Orleans	LOCATION	. ''

		I know well , ''
Metternich	PERSON	had said to the French Ambassador at
Vienna	LOCATION	, '' that the free - dom of the press and your electoral laws are an abomination , but any attempt to abolish them by a coup d'etat will be fatal to the Bourbons . ''

		There are Richelieus ,
Talley	ORGANIZATION	rands , Chateau - briands , LaFayettes , -- leaders good -LRB- a few -RRB- , bad , and indifferent : but the most picturesque public character of the period , and in a manner the most instructive , as illustrating the possi - bilities of such an epoch of upheaval , is the scoundrel
Fouche	PERSON	.

		This insatiate schemer , edu - cated for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, a Revolutionist deputy , regicide , devotee of the
Goddess of Reason	ORGANIZATION	, actually succeeded in becoming successively Minister to
Milan	LOCATION	under the
Directory	ORGANIZATION	,
Minis	LOCATION	- ter of Police under the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	,
Minister of Interior	ORGANIZATION	under the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	,
Minister of Police	ORGANIZATION	under Louis XVIII .

		-- in which last capacity he drew up a list of the persons who deserved punishment for complicity in the return of Na - poleon , which list he should have himself headed .

		It is but just to him to remark in this connec - tion , that he contrived to allow all the proscribed to escape from the country , and that the few ar - rests and executions that did occur were not in any sense his fault .

		It was not till
1816	DATE	, at the age of sixty-two , that this prodigy of intrigue , who had contrived to float to the winning side of every considerable movement in forty years of turmoil , was at last definitely set aside by exile .

		Every movement , however vulgar and inter - ested , has its hero and its legend .

		The dead Emperor did more to wreck the Bourbon dy - nasty than that hard and vicious creature of ambition ever accomplished during his life .

		And set up against him to dazzle the gaze of the mob was the glorious First of the Bourbons , the gallant conqueror of
Ivry	PERSON	, who seems to have resembled this portrait quite as much as his dissipated , selfish , and incompetent descendants of the early nineteenth century resembled it .

		But legends will not stir a worn-out people to long-continued or potent enthusiasm .

		There was little real desire for the crowning of
Louis	LOCATION	in
1814	DATE	; there was little for the return of
Napoleon	LOCATION	; there was little for the accession of the younger branch of the Bourbons in
1830	DATE	.

Metternich	ORGANIZATION	, re - marked , as he took possession of

		There were no more serious and general insurrections ; and when the half-hearted !

		Citizen King was half-heartedly installed in
1830	DATE	, he was allowed to reign for a time only , because , as Major
Hall	PERSON	puts it on the last page of the present volume , '' In the hour of distress the best elements of the nation '' had `` stood aloof and allowed the Monarchy to fall to the -LSB- ground . ''

		A very thorough and extensive bibliography !

		accompanies the text , page by page ; and the book is indexed in a good deal of detail .

		It is always a matter of regret , however , when a painstaking and extended account of this sort , which is particularly valuable for reference purposes , has no more specific indexing than , for example ,
LaFayette	LOCATION	, Marquis de , 43 , 52 , | 87 , 101 , 102 , 112 , etc. , with no hint of the character of the references on each page thus mentioned .

		The reviewer wondered at the form emigre -- thus , italicized , with an accent over the final j e only .

		If one accent , why not both ?

		If there is precedent for such discrimination , he has not found it .

		He has noticed , indeed , that the '' Encyclopaedia Americana '' prints '' Emigres , '' ; but he had supposed that the first accent was omitted there because of the capital initial ' letter .

		150 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, biblical research .

		The works are constructed mechanically in the best modern style , and are both attractive and convenient .

		The editor of the Hastings '' Dictionary of the Bible '' has had large editorial experience , and has constructed this work skilfully from a literary point of view .

		It is by no means a con - densation of the five-volume Dictionary , but a new and independent work .

		The articles are written anew , and are up-to-date in every respect .

		The apportionment of space to the different themes is wisely made .

		The article on ''
Israel	LOCATION	'' covers twenty-four pages -LRB- by Prof.
George A. Barton	PERSON	-RRB- ; that on `` Jesus Christ '' -LRB- by Prof.
W. P. Paterson	PERSON	-RRB- , twenty-three pages ; and one on the '' Person of Christ '' -LRB- by Prof.
H. K. Mackintosh	PERSON	-RRB- , twelve pages .

		Mr.
R. A. S. Macalister	PERSON	writes many of the articles on Pales - tine , where he has spent several years in exca - vating Gezer and other places .

		The articles on
Egypt	LOCATION	and Egyptian antiquities are signed by Mr.
F. LI	PERSON	.


Griffith	PERSON	, whose work on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	has been well known for many years .

		Some of the best articles on the New Testament were written by Prof.
W. T. Davison	PERSON	, of
Richmond	LOCATION	Theo - logical Seminary ,
Surrey	LOCATION	.

		Prof.
G. B. Gray	PERSON	, of
Mansfield College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, has contributed a very complete article on the '' Text , Versions , and Languages of the Old Testament '' ; and Dr.
F. G. Kenyon	PERSON	, just now appointed as successor to Sir
E. Maunde Thompson	PERSON	of the British Museum , supplies the article on the '' Text of the New Testament . ''

		The book contains four good maps , but no other illustrations .

		The '' Standard Bible Dictionary '' was writ - ten mainly by American scholars for an Ameri - can public .

		It follows , in its classification , an encyclopaedic alphabet ; that is , its list of themes is constructed on an encyclopaedic rather than a dictionary plan .

		The articles themselves appear , when long enough , with numbered paragraphs and a brief bibliography .

		The editors them - selves have done a monumental amount of writ - ing for the work .

		Professor
Jacobus	PERSON	's contri - butions are mainly on the
New Testament	LOCATION	; Pro- fessor Zenos has covered , besides his especial field of Biblical Theology , a great diversity of themes ; and Professor
Nourse	PERSON	fills in scores of small arti - cles on etymological , archaeological , and topo - graphical themes .

		Dr.
James Denney	PERSON	of Glas - gow has an article on Christ , and Professor Guthe of
Leipzig	LOCATION	on Palestine .

		The article on
Jerusalem	LOCATION	is by the skilful scholar Prof.
L. B. Paton	PERSON	, who recently spent a year in that ancient and interesting city .

		The Dictionary is espe - cially full in the department of biblical archaeol - ogy , emphasized by a number of beautiful half - tone illustrations of Palestinian implements and household effects now in the collections of
Hart	PERSON	- ford
Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book contains many line illustrations that amply aid the reader in understanding the text .

		Of course , there are defects and omissions which are apparent to an expert , -- such , for example , as the attempt to present in transliteration the pronunciation of biblical names and Hebrew words .

		These are rather superfluous , and not helpful .

		The scholar knows how to pronounce the foreign words -LRB- Greek and Hebrew -RRB- , and the one who knows neither language has no use for them .

		A few good maps adorn the book .

		It may be added that these two Dictionaries are thought by their editors to be adapted to the use of laymen in
Bible	LOCATION	study , but they are grad - uated on rather too high a scale for that purpose .

		Excellent as they are , they are strong meat for mature scholars rather than lighter food for children in
Bible	LOCATION	study .

		`` The Temple Dictionary of the Bible '' stands in a class by itself .

		The names of its two editors are enough to call attention to the work .

		Both of them were missionaries for many years in the country which forms the back - ground of the biblical records .

		Rev. Mr.
Ewing	PERSON	was located at that very important old Jewish city ,
Tiberias	LOCATION	, and Dr.
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	at
Safed	LOCATION	, about fifteen miles nearly north of the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	.

		Their first-hand knowledge of and familiarity with the manners and customs of the people , and with the topography of Bible lands , give them a long advantage over some of the editors of rival dictionaries .

		They are aided in this phase of the work by such familiar
Ori	PERSON	- entalists as Dr.
Dalman	PERSON	of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Gibson	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and Drs.
Margoliouth	PERSON	and
Sayce of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, all travellers and stu - dents in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		The critical position of the writers on doctrinal and biblical themes is distinctly conservative , as seen in such names as those of Drs.
James Orr	PERSON	,
James Robert	PERSON	- son ,
James Stalker	PERSON	, and
D. S. Margoliouth	PERSON	.

		The Preface states that they '' have kept stead - ily in view the needs of the Working Clergy - man , the Local Preacher , the Class Leader , and the Sunday-school Teacher . ''

		They have fulfilled their purpose in a very commendable manner .

		While there are no articles whose revelations are startlingly new or striking , there are some that are comparatively fresh on bib - lical antiquities , geography , and topography , written by persons who are experienced guides and know personally what they are talking
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 151 about .

		The articles are free from padding ; on the other hand , the work employs a system of abbreviations , which , though unquestionably effective in space-saving , is , to say the least , far from elegant .

		It is certainly startling to find a work of scholarship , like this , disfigured by such typographical puzzles as wd. , shd. , cd. , fni. ,
fr.	LOCATION	, nn \ , br. , sr. , kge. , bk. , mt. , for would , should , could , from , father , mother , brother , sister , knowledge , book , and might .

		A very attractive feature of this Dictionary is its admirable illustrations , many of which are half - tones .

		Among the 5-40 in the book , we dis - cover scores of new pictures of biblical sites and scenes , photographed from new and splen - didly chosen points of view .

		There are at least sixteen choice views of the beautiful scenery about the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	.

		Such glimpses give more of a touch of reality to any statement than pages of common cold narrative .

		Two new large folding views of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	and eight splendid maps follow the
1171	DATE	pages of the Dictionary proper .

		These three Dictionaries , appearing almost simultaneously , are significant facts in the field of biblical study .

		They furnish ready tools whereby the earnest thoughtful reader and stu - dent may delve still deeper into the realms of ancient ethical and religious lore .

		tures of himself and his party , but also the deeds of others who have risked their lives , -- to put it in
Stevenson	PERSON	's paradoxical way , -- that they might live .

		One bit will show the manner of the narrator .

		It tells the story of the tall and wiry
Lumbwa	LOCATION	, Arab Tumo .

		slayer of sixty '' rhinos '' single-handed , who estab - lished his reputation for bravery by his part in the following incident . ''

		While about half-way down from the summit to the swamp , with Arab Tumo marching ahead of me , and , although no more than six feet in advance , quite out of my sight , sud - denly I heard just beyond him the swish and crashing of some mighty body , and jumped forward to Arab Tumo just in time to see a giant rhino , which had been crossing our line of march directly in front , start to swing for a charge up our line , his great head shaking with rage , his little pig eyes glaring fury . ''

		It was all over in a second ; for when I reached Tumo they were in arm 's length of each other , he crouched with spear shortened , and , in the very second of the rhino 's swing to charge , with one bound and mighty thrust he drove his great three-foot six-inch-spear-blade to entry behind the left shoulder , ranging diagonally through the rhino 's vitals towards his right hip .

		and burying it to the very haft ! ''

		Followed instantly a shrill scream of pain , a gush of foam-flecked blood that told of a deadly lung wound , and then the monster wheeled and lurched out of our sight down hill at right angles to our course , Tumo 's spear still trans - fixing him . ''

		So suddenly sprung and so fascinating was the scene , so like a single-handed duel of the old Roman arena between two raw savage monsters of the African jungle , biped against quadruped , that it never occurred to me to shoot , although I might have chanced a snapshot over Tumo 's shoulder . ''

		And there Arab Tumo stood quietly smiling , his pulse apparently unquickened by a single beat , signing for per - mission to follow and recover his spear , the blade broken free of its long-pointed iron butt , which was bent nearly double by some wrench in the ground the rhino had con - trived to give it to free his vitals of the gnawing blade !

		And , once free of the spear , on he had gone -- Tumo had not seen him again . ''

		Many readers of books on
Africa	LOCATION	, who have won - dered at the stories of the marvellous heads of game along the
Uganda	LOCATION	railway , will understand this re - markable occurrence from Mr.
Bronson	PERSON	's explana - tion .

		`` The extraordinary present abundance of game both north and south of this section of the
Uganda	LOCATION	Railway is due to the fact that all the vast territory extending from the
Tsavo River	LOCATION	to
Escarpment	ORGANIZATION	, a distance of two hundred and thirty miles , and from the south line of the track to the German border , embracing about eleven thousand square miles , is a carefully preserved game reserve , preserved as jealously as the
Yellowstone Park	LOCATION	; while immediately south - west of it in German territory is another reserve of the same size .

		Unfenced , shut in by no impassable streams or moun - tains , the game is free to wander out of and into the reserve at will ; but , like the shrewd stags of a Scotch deer forest , so well does the game seem to know the very boundaries that mark for them sanctuary , that little do they leave it except in periods of local drought or as crowded out by over - stocking , -- so well do they know the immunity of sanctuary that , shooting from trains being forbidden , timid antelope , wary giraffe , and even lion and rhino , often idle within a stone 's throw of the track .

		* ' Surely Africa must be protected in some way , for , not taking into account our own mighty Nimrod who is now playing havoc there , Mr.
Bronson	PERSON	tells us that in
October	DATE	and
November , 1908	DATE	, twenty hunting parties went out from
Nairobi	LOCATION	, and fifty more were 152 THE DIA1 , -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, expected during
December	DATE	and
January	DATE	.

		It is to be regretted that our space will not allow us to give more excerpts from this lively book .

		Mr.
Bronson	PERSON	's style will not appeal to the fastidious , but his robust vigor will suit those readers who care more for fine shots with the gun than with the camera , and for forceful description than for parlor language .

		To the list of those American sportsmen -- nota -
bly McMillan	PERSON	,
Astor	LOCATION	,
Chanlar	LOCATION	,
John Bradley	PERSON	,
Max Fleischman	PERSON	, Rainsf ord , and
Roosevelt	PERSON	-- who have had their fling at African big game , we may now add the name of Mr.
Percy C. Madeira	PERSON	of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia .

		His book entitled '' Hunting in
British East Africa	LOCATION	'' tells of the adventures of himself and his wife in '' the most richly stocked game country to be found in the world to-day '' -- British East
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Frederick C. Selous	PERSON	, the premier of modern hunters , vouches for the book in a foreword , by saying that it is of '' very great interest . ''

		Were one to judge hastily of the book by the illustrations , one would conclude that the author 's chief aim was to gather fine heads and make big killings .

		Such , however , is not the case .

		Of hunting and fine heads we have a-plenty , but there is also no lack of intel - ligent observation on native human and plant life , and on general conditions now existing in that won - derful dark land .

		Moreover , if other Americans are desirous of adding their names to the worthy list of African big game hunters , they will find a very complete appendix to this volume giving de - tailed information regarding marches , temperature , and equipment , for a hundred days ' safari , or jour - ney , in the land of wild beasts .

		Readers who wish to read a hair-raising tale will find unusually rare ones in this book .

		Mrs.
Madeira	LOCATION	, who was lost in `` the rough broken country between the
Tana	LOCATION	and the
Thika Rivers	LOCATION	, '' wandered for two days without food or water , in a land beset by thorns and wild beasts .

		Mr.
Selous	PERSON	characterizes the grit and pow - ers of endurance shown by Mrs.
Madeira	PERSON	as '' little short of marvellous . ''

		The illustrations in this vol - ume are of rather unusual merit .

		Lieutenant-Colonel
J. H. Patterson	PERSON	's book , '' In the Grip of the Nyika , '' has the stamp of dignity both in style and matter .

		Unlike his previous work , `` The Man-Eaters of
Tsavo	LOCATION	, '' which relates the Colonel 's adventures with the kingly beast , his pres - ent volume deals with the determination of suitable natural boundaries for the eastern and northern limits of the game preserve , and with the hunting of elephants , antelope , and rhinoceri .

		In the first of these expeditions into the
Nyika	LOCATION	-- the dark , enthralling wilderness of British
East Africa	LOCATION	-- the author with two companions returned safely to civili - zation ; but on the second and longer journey , he , with two companions designated as Mr. and Mrs. B. , met with difficulties and with death .

		Mr.
B.	PERSON	was shot while asleep by the accidental discharge of his own revolver which he had placed under his pil - low .

		At the time of his burial , the natives mutinied , and it was only through the prompt action of Colonel
Patterson	PERSON	that they were quelled .

		Following these disasters came the loss of his valuable horse under the charge of a rogue elephant , the desertion of many of his followers , and the continual illness of himself and Mrs. B. Notwithstanding all this , the author 's indomitable courage led him to his journey 's end , thus establishing a name for himself as one of the heroes who have been in the foreguard of the British Empire .

		Colonel
Patterson	PERSON	's book , unlike Mr.
Bron	PERSON	- son 's , shows us the sombre side of life on the great African veldt ; but it is African life to the core . ''

		After experience in hunting with a rifle , and with a camera to a lesser degree , I am frank to con - fess that I have found an element of excitement in the former totally lacking in the latter . ''

		With this confession , Mr.
Edward T. House	PERSON	introduces us to his adventures in
East Africa	LOCATION	,
New Brunswick	LOCATION	,
New Foundland	LOCATION	, the Rockies , and
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, as related in his interesting and well-illustrated vol - ume of detached sketches entitled `` A Hunter 's C amp - Fires . ''

		Mr.
House	PERSON	's sketches cover a decade spent in the pursuit of the big game of the world , and relate but little about the natives who made up his caravans .

		For the reader who cares only about the crack of the rifle and the effect thereof , Mr.
House	PERSON	's book will afford a good treat ; but for the reader who thinks that hunting is more than the hunter , and the hunted more than the bag , the book will offer small pleasure .

		We would not suggest that the author is that atrocious being , a game-hog , -- on the contrary he is quite sportsmanlike in his following ; but he has not the saving grace which leads us to the up - lands of foreign lands where we may get the vision of nature 's abundant wild life .

		The author will doubtless be satisfied with the commentary that this is a book for the man with a gu *

		, In '' English Literature in the Nine - A new survey '' of 19th century teenth Century -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Mr. literature .


Laurie Magnus	PERSON	has given us an inter - esting and valuable discussion of the characteristics and tendencies of that period .

		He has especially tried to make his book -- a volume of 427 pages -- '' not so much a history of English literature between
1784	DATE	and the present day as a survey of that litera - ture as a whole and an essay in its criticism . ''

		For this reason the book contains little biographical mat - ter .

		The criticism is of an eminently satisfactory kind .

		Mr.
Magnus	PERSON	is not concerned merely with re-estimating the individual writers , though this task occupies , naturally , most of his time ; he is deeply interested in the literary movements of the century ; in the peculiar significance of the typical and the col - lective utterances of the successive periods .

		Book I. surveys the period from the death of
Johnson	PERSON	to that of
Scott	LOCATION	, -- the period which saw the principles of the French Revolution extended in all directions , the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 153 rapid growth of the novel , the enunciation of new principles of poetry , and the rise of the periodical press .

		Toward the end of this period there is a lull , a pause .

		Byron -LRB- on whom Mr.
Magnus	PERSON	is less severe than are many others -RRB- ,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	had passed off the stage .

		Wordsworth 's poetry had heen practically all written before this time .

		Car - lyle , that
John Baptist	PERSON	of the new time , had not yet found a publisher for his gospel of '' Sartor '' in book form .

		The year 1832 , thinks
Magnus	PERSON	, looks back on the great period of Romance and forward to the great period of Democracy .

		The Reform Bill marks the decisive acquisition of immense social and moral gains .

		A new view of nature , physical and spiritual , was to possess men .

		Mr.
Magnus	PERSON	instructively con - trasts the thought of the `` Essay on Man '' -LRB- 1733 -RRB- with the view of things that prevailed from the times when the revolutionary principles became completely established .

		The second half of the book discusses the remainder of the century .

		The three-score and eight years between
Scott	PERSON	's death and that of
Ruskin	PERSON	beheld enormous progress in science , the rise of almost radically new views in theology , the flower - ing of the novel , and the flourishing of three great poets ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Swinburne	PERSON	, around whom may be clustered a multitude of lesser lights .

		Tennysonians will be pleased with the treatment accorded their poet on the score of form , but will not relish so much the belittling estimate of him as a thinker .

		Tennyson 's growing conservatism and con - stant timidity do not please Mr.
Magnus	PERSON	. ''

		Do noth - ing , dare nothing , assert nothing -- tradition , cus - tom , doubt -- are at the root of his practical counsel , and ` the larger hope , ' and the ` divine event ' are subordinate to these negations . ''

		Magnus admires the energy and solidity of
Browning	PERSON	's thought as well as his sturdy faith .

		To
Dickens	PERSON	and Meredith the critic is quite just .

		On Swinburne he wisely refrains from attempting a final judgment , though he is a frank admirer of the last Victorian .

		Occasionally the author 's style is enigmatical , -- for example , at the end of the description of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries -LRB- p. 179 -RRB- ; but in general he is illuminating and lucid .

		Crawford must be claimed as an American -LRB- p. 278 -RRB- ; and
William James	PERSON	is a resident of
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 222 -RRB- .

		Perhaps there is too fre - quent use of the dash-parenthesis ; and a dash fol - lowed by a comma or semicolon does not look well .

		The index is scarcely full enough .

		On the whole we find the volume commendable , a distinctly wel - come contribution to the criticism of an era which will receive more attention in the
next quarter	DATE	cen - tury , as its true proportions become more evident and perspective enables us to see more clearly what it achieved .

		An advocate of woman 's rights is not o/jfoUand '' wont to turn to seventeenth-century
Holland	PERSON	for a champion , and indeed no suffragette is the '' Learned Maid '' who looks out from her forgotten niche in history through the pleasant pages of
Una Birch	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Anna van Schurman	PERSON	, Artist , Scholar , Saint '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Yet the '' Tenth Muse , '' the '' Sappho of
Holland	LOCATION	, '' as she was styled by her contemporaries , qualified for controversy when she queried , '' Does the pursuit of learning and letters become a girl of to-day ? ''

		and proceeded to apply to her sex Plato 's dictum , '' It becomes a per - fect man to know what is to be known and to do what is to be done . ''

		Etched against the background of the Dutch Renaissance , with its '' amazing efflores - cence of national life , '' the `` Star of Utrecht '' shines with a light diffused through varied mediums .


Marie de Medici	PERSON	, hearing her sing , declared how '' pleasant a surprise it was to find
Italy	LOCATION	in
Holland	LOCATION	. ''

		After betraying her versatility in the current forms of art , she plunged as ardently into learning , mastering many languages and achieving the unique distinction of the authorship of an Ethiopian grammar .

		An object of pilgrimage for the notables of
Europe	LOCATION	, the friend of
Descartes	LOCATION	, Vo6t ,
Richelieu	LOCATION	, Queen
Christina	PERSON	of
Sweden	LOCATION	, and other famous folk , the gentle lady 's gentle adventures make picturesque reading .

		Not the least entertaining passages are the panegyrics of ad - mirers , which , despite her decorous modesty , seem to have '' delighted
Anna	PERSON	, who , together with the solid virtues of perseverance , concentration , and courage , was possessed of an amusing vanity which redeems her from all charge of inhumanity or dull - ness . ''

		A chronic habit of depicting herself and of being depicted has scattered her portrait throughout
Europe	LOCATION	, several being reproduced in the book .

		In the latter part of her life the pursuit of holiness absorbed her as completely as had her previous enter - prises , and her diverse friendships gave way to one commanding intercourse .

		Resolving to spend her days '' in the studio in which souls are as canvas to be painted on by the great master , '' she joined the community founded by the mystical preacher ,
Jean de Labadie	PERSON	.

		It is a matter for regret that here exig - ences of material or deficiencies in popular know - ledge have compelled the author to shift the limelight from her leading lady to the tenets of Calvinistic theology and the fortunes of the Labadist community with which
Anna	PERSON	cast in her lot .

		Yet it is hard to quarrel with a book which so well fulfils its own aim : simply to set down the story of a '' fearless , famed , and retired life . ''

		Slavery and secession in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		A
Richmond	LOCATION	lawyer , Mr.
Beverly B. Munford	PERSON	, in his book on `` Vir - ginia 's Attitude toward Slavery and Secession '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- has done some really origi - nal work upon a rather hackneyed topic .

		Based upon a careful study of historical sources -- manu - scripts , public records , and newspapers , as well as the published works relating to the subject -- the book is of value to the historian of slavery , politics , and the Civil War .

		The purpose of the author is to make clear the attitude of the dominant element of the Virginian people toward the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, the problems of slavery , emancipation , and secession .

		By extensive quotations from public documents , 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, speeches , and letters , he shows that the Virginians , were not hostile , hut were devoted to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and to the principles of the founders of the Repuhlic ; that they were not devoted to the institution of slavery and desirous of seeing it extended , but that they were much dissatisfied with it and made serious efforts to get rid of it .

		The reactionary effect of the methods of the radical abolitionists upon anti- slavery sentiment in
Virginia	LOCATION	is explained in detail , and the rise of pro-slavery sentiment is traced to the secession .

		Of the general conditions of slavery the author writes but little , though he gives a good treatment of the colonization movement and a dis - cussion of the difficulties in the way of emancipation .

		The economic aspects of the '' peculiar institution '' are neglected .

		As to secession , Mr.
Munford	PERSON	proves that
Virginia	LOCATION	was strongly opposed to such a step , and that only after she had vainly tried to reconcile the sections was she forced by the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	policy of coercion to range herself with the cotton States that had already seceded .

		Of the characteristics of the Virginians who thus stood between the two extremes and were forced to choose one or the other , the author says : `` Asa people they exalted honor and courage -- they exhibited the strength of the idealist combined on the part of many with the limitations of the doctrinaire ; they decided questions by the standard of abstract right , rather than in their relation to the duties and interests of other peoples and other times ; they were self-reliant , content to justify the integrity of their conduct to their own consciences rather than to the world ; they were tenacious of their rights , and regarded a threatened invasion as not only justifying but com - pelling resistance . ''

		Secession came to these people as an event * • long dreaded and much to be deplored .

		They met it with a firm adherence to the principles so often declared , but with profound regret that the occasion had arisen which rendered their assertion imperative .

		In the conflict thus joined , the people of
Virginia	LOCATION	took a stand predetermined by the be - liefs and avowals of successive generations , and , impelled by an unswerving idealism , found their supreme incentive to action in their determination to maintain the integrity of principle . ''

		Autobiopraphv In a clearly-written narrative of of a Chinese - moderate length , Mr.
Yung Wing	PERSON	, American .

		sometime Associate Chinese Minister at
Washington	LOCATION	, and Commissioner of the
Chinese Educational Commission	ORGANIZATION	, relates the main events of his active and useful life . ''

		My Life in
China	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is the book 's title , and a prepos - sessing portrait of the author serves as frontispiece .

		Born of poor parents in the village of Nam Ping , near
Macao	LOCATION	, the boy Yung had the good fortune to receive the rudiments of an English education in a mission school , which gave him a desire to go still further in occidental learning .

		How his desire was gratified , chiefly through his own pluck and perse - verance , how he entered the
Monson Academy	PERSON	, was graduated , and then proceeded to
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, where he remained four years , took high honors in English , and was the first Chinese student to receive a degree , -- all this is unassumingly told in the opening chapters ; after which comes the account of his self-imposed labors for his country , his adventures in the
Taiping	LOCATION	rebellion , his work for the American education of Chinese boys , his appointment as joint minister with Chin Lan Pin at
Washington	LOCATION	, and his diplomatic activities in connection with the Japanese war of 1894-5 .

		His opinion as to the cause of the
Taiping	LOCATION	rebellion is noteworthy .

		u Neither Christianity nor religious persecution , '' he maintains , '' was the im - mediate and logical cause of the rebellion of
1850	DATE	.

		They might be taken as incidents or occasions that brought it about , but they were not the real causes of its existence .

		These may be found deeply seated in the vitals of the political constitution of the gov - ernment .

		Foremost among them was the corruption of the administrative government . ''

		In other words , it was '' graft '' that caused all the mischief .

		The author has excellent command of his adopted lan - guage , having in fact at one time all but forgotten his native tongue ; and for both style and substance his book commends itself .

		„
Charon	PERSON	, seated on one of the twin
Nearness	ORGANIZATION	' , to the ideal peaks of
Parnassus	LOCATION	, surveying all the Greek spirit .

		Greek world , had no wider range of vision than Professor
Francis G.	PERSON	and Mrs.
Anne C. E. Allinson	PERSON	, in their book on '' Greek Lands and Letters '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		While the task that they assume of interpreting '' Greek lands by the litera - ture , and Greek literature by local associations and physical environment , '' in one volume , may appear Herculean , yet because of their simple modus operandi they have succeeded admirably in produc - ing a scholarly , and yet withal pleasing , book of travel .

		They treat all of the fourteen odd divisions of
Greece	LOCATION	in the same manner , -- first , its physical characteristics ; then the mythological and historical accounts , to complete the stage setting ; and finally the literature produced by and about each particular locality for interpreting Greek life and institutions .

		Thus
Attica	LOCATION	, open to all the world by reason of its geographical situation , becam e the world 's intellectual and literary clearing-house in religion , politics , and the fine arts .

		Sparta , on the other hand , hemmed in on three sides by mountains , was '' extraordi - narily bare of artistic adornment . ''

		After a careful examination of the twenty chapters dealing with these sympathetic phases of physiography and lit - erature , the reader feels that he has obtained , in a most learned and entertaining way , an outline of the different factors in Greek civilization , and has brought most vividly to his mind an inkling of `` what is most vital in our Hellenic heritage . ''

		Travellers who digest the contents of this volume will feel that they are in close touch with the ideal Greek spirit , and that they have progressed from thyrsus-bearers to mystics .

		The four maps and numerous photographic illustrations , together with the colored frontispiece , are instructive and interesting .

		THE DIAL 155 Ardent lovers of
Dickens	PERSON	can never tf % c7eZ7ana .

		h ^ ve enough of him ; and so they will welcome Mr.
W. Teignmouth Shore	PERSON	's attractive octavo , ''
Charles Dickens	PERSON	and His Friends '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- , in which has been assembled a considerable selection of passages about
Dickens	PERSON	by his contemporaries , and about them by him and by one another .

		Forster is , of course , the chief authority consulted , while
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Jeffrey	PERSON	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Milnes	PERSON	, and our own
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
James T. Fields	PERSON	, are among the host of others drawn upon for material .

		The author occasionally speaks in his own person , and at other times quotes without citing his authority .

		Five portraits of
Dickens	LOCATION	, with other illustrations , adorn the volume , and it is an interesting study to note the wide difference between the young Apollo of
Maclise	ORGANIZATION	's painting and the some - what severe and careworn middle-aged man from
Frith	ORGANIZATION	's brush .

		The '' door-knocker '' beard of the latter portrait was abhorred by
Forster	PERSON	, but
Dickens	PERSON	himself gloried in it and was '' told by some of his friends that they highly approved of the change because they now saw less of him . ''

		Mr.
Shore	PERSON	has produced an agreeable scrap-book which evidences diligence , ingenuity , and not too slavish regard for method .

		No index is provided , and no list of authorities , nor is the reader 's attention distracted by footnotes .

		Of preface , too , the book is innocent , and of appendix it pleads not guilty .

		It is just an unpretentious compilation of entertaining
Dickens	PERSON	- iana , a book to read in at odd moments and not to take too seriously .

		A college president 1 s pilgrimage .

		The reader of
Miss Caroline Hazard	ORGANIZATION	's volume , `` A Brief Pilgrimage in the Holy Land '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will wish that he might have heard the addresses that form the book , as they were originally given in the college chapel at
Wellesley	LOCATION	on
Sunday	DATE	evenings .

		With appropriate music for each address --
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	's
Elijah	PERSON	for u
Carmel	LOCATION	by the Sea , '' the Pastoral Sym - phony for `` The Plain of Sharon , '' Christmas music for ''
Bethlehem	LOCATION	'' ; with graceful and rare-spirited sonnets read for a prelude ; and with fitting quota - tions from the Scriptures for each address , there must have been an atmosphere of sanctity and a dim religious light which the printed book can not give .

		Nevertheless , the fervor of the author gives us the light and the peace of one who , like her ancestors in the Crusades , went down from
Carmel	LOCATION	to the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	, and thence to the blessed feast at
Jerusalem	LOCATION	.

		There is a sufficient amount of historical background to make the book instructive as well as uplifting : the sights and incidents of the holy Past give the author occasion , which she wisely improves , for deal - ing with the no less holy Present .

		No doubt , as Pres - ident Hazard says , ''
Wellesley	LOCATION	ought to be a better college because its President has been on pilgrimage '' ; and equally , no doubt , every hearer of the addresses and every reader of the book will be somehow better for hearing and reading the story .

		Notes .

		The
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, publish a vol - ume of '' University Addresses '' by Professor
William Watts Folwell	PERSON	.

		The addresses are four in number , and are dated from
1869	DATE	to
1884	DATE	.

		Privately printed by Mr.
Luther A. Brewer	PERSON	at
Cedar Rapids	ORGANIZATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	, we have a limited edition of
Stedman	PERSON	's little book upon
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	.

		The original of this work is now hard to obtain , which makes this beautiful new edition all the more welcome . ''

		Selections from the
Economic History	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, 1765-1860 , '' by Professor Guy
Stevens Collen	PERSON	- der , is a publication of
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is in form a source-book , with extensive introductory essays supplied for the several chapters .

		There are fifteen main divisions , such as '' Colonial P ^ conomy , '' '' Trans - portation , '' '' Settlement of the West , '' and '' Economics of Slavery . ''

		The book is a large one , numbering over eight hundred pages . ''

		The People 's Library , '' a series of handy and inex - pensive volumes , which have had a large sale in En - gland , will be put upon the American market by
Messrs. Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the latest additions to the '' Li - brary '' are to be noted
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Master of Bal - lantrae , ''
Hawthorne	PERSON	's '' House of the Seven Gables , ''
Jane Austen	PERSON	's ''
Emma	PERSON	, ''
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	's '' Villette , '' Borrow 's '' Lavengro , '' Irving 's '' Sketch Book , '' Rus - kin 's '' Crown of Wild Olives '' and '' Seven Lamps of Architecture , '' Pope 's translation of the '' Iliad , '' De - foe 's `` Journal of the Plague Year , ''
Holmes	PERSON	's `` Pro- fessor at the Breakfast Table , '' and
Thomas	PERSON	a Rempis 's '' Imitation of Christ . ''

		A unique and delightful publishing enterprise is that known -- but not so widely as its merits deserve -- as ''
John Martin	PERSON	's Letters for Children . ''

		One has only to send to the publisher -LRB-
Morgan Shepard	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- , stating the age of the boy or girl to be written to , and once in every two weeks a letter is forthcoming . ''


John Martin	PERSON	'' writes about animals and fairies and children and other things that children love .

		He puts in a rhyme or two towards the end , and a talk about books for boys and girls .

		He draws pictures to illus - trate his stories , and his writing is plain , so that little folks can read it .

		There is a space for the name of each small recipient at the beginning of the letters ; and this , with their friendly intimate style , would make it very difficult to prove to any of ''
John Martin	PERSON	's '' many correspondents that the '' Letters '' are only a sort of bi-monthly magazine pleasantly disguised .

		Mr.
H. E. Marshall	PERSON	, who , several years ago , published a history of
England	LOCATION	for young readers , now gives us a companion volume in '' The Child 's English Literature '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a difficult task to interest youth in the history of literature , but our author has achieved some measure of success by his avoidance of text-book methods , his adoption of a simple and unaffected style , and his choice of such material as can be brought into some sort of real relationship with childish interests .

		His scale of proportion is quite different , as is proper , from that which would be imperative in a book for older people .

		His book has , moreover , the advantage of a series of beautiful and instructive illustrations in color , to say nothing of its attractive typography and boldly - decorated covers .

		For the right kind of boy or girl from twelve to sixteen , we could not imagine a more welcome gift or delightful possession .

		NOTES 206 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF SPRING BOOKS ... 207 A classified list of books to be issued by American publishers during the
Spring	DATE	and
Summer of 1910	DATE	.

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 216 THE KEATS-SHELLEY MEMORIAL .

		It is now almost a year since the ceremonial opening of the
Keats-Shelley Memorial House	ORGANIZATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	-- the house in the
Piazza di Spagna	LOCATION	to which
Keats	PERSON	was brought by
Joseph Severn	PERSON	, and in which the poet died
February 23 , 1821	DATE	.

		The first Bulletin of the
Memorial Association	ORGANIZATION	has just been issued , under the editorship of
Sir Rennell Rodd	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
H. Nelson Gay	PERSON	, and for the first time makes public the full details of the exercises , besides presenting much other matter of deep interest to the lovers of the two English poets whose dying gaze was fixed upon Italian skies .

		Henceforth poetry-loving pil - grims from the English-speaking world to the
Eternal City	ORGANIZATION	will pay double tribute to the memory of
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	, -- first at the twin tombs in the shadow of the Pyramid of Cestius , and then at the house which is now dedicated to these two immortal singers .

		The inception aud progress of the enterprise so happily conceived and successfully carried into effect may be briefly recapitulated .

		It was in
1903	DATE	, on the anniversary of
Keats	PERSON	's death , that the plan took definite shape at the meeting of a small group of American authors who were then fortuitously gathered in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The ini - tiative was due to Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	, and his efforts were cordially seconded by Sir
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	.

		It was determined to organize English and American and Roman committees , to obtain the official sanction of the
King of Italy	LOCATION	, the
King of England	ORGANIZATION	, and the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, and to invite subscriptions for the purchase of the desired house .

		It took three years to conduct the pre - liminary negotiations with the Italian owners of the property , and then , with an option on its purchase secured , the plan was made pub - lic .

		About a year of effort was required to secure the necessary funds -LRB- something over twenty thousand dollars -RRB- , and then the property was bought by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Gifts of books , manuscripts , and works of art suitable for preservation in such a place , were then solic - ited , and the demand met with a generous response .

		More material gifts were also forth - coming , including the furnishing of the rooms of the second-floor apartment which Keats occu - 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, pied , and the Memorial was ready for its formal dedication .

		It should be added that a perpet - ual , if modest , endowment fund is provided by the rental of the otherwise unoccupied parts of the building .

		The dedicatory ceremonies were held
April 3 , 1909	DATE	, in the presence of the King of
Italy	LOCATION	, the British and
American Ambassadors	ORGANIZATION	, and about sixty invited guests , among whom were the Rev. Mr.
Esdaile	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	's grandson , and Mr.
Arthur Severn	PERSON	, the son of
Joseph Severn	PERSON	.

		Sir
Rennell Rodd	PERSON	opened the exercises with a few well-chosen words , expressing his trust that the house will remain in perpetuity '' a centre of interest and a shrine of pilgrimage to all the English-speaking people who come to this hos - pitable
Italy	LOCATION	, which all our poets have loved and to which in the century which has lately closed a large portion of their genius has been dedi - cated . ''

		Mr.
H. Nelson Gay	PERSON	, admitting that
England	LOCATION	had '' furnished the poets '' for the Memorial , said that
America	LOCATION	had shared in appreciating their genius , reprinting them steadily from
1821	DATE	onwards .

		And he added , addressing the King : '' No project which bears the name of
Italy	LOCATION	can fail to receive enthusiastic support across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
R. U. John	PERSON	- son , unable to be present , sent a letter paying tribute to
Keats	PERSON	and Shelley -- '' the freshness of their verse ; their soaring imagination ; the exquisite music of their rhythms ; the ardor and breadth of their sympathies ; their steadfast con - viction of justice as the foundation of human government ; the gracious tradition of their per - sonal lovableness , and the glowing ideality of their devotion to a noble art . ''

		An address by
Signor Ferdinando Martini	PERSON	, statesman and scholar , was given in eloquent Italian .

		He brought a continental and quasi - political note into the proceedings , calling Keats '' the
Andre Chenier	PERSON	of English poetry , the unwearied seeker after the perfection of form , '' and speaking of
Shelley	PERSON	's prophetic vision that a century ago '' perceived
Rome	LOCATION	rending the sacerdotal cowl , and the shepherds of Ausonia chasing the northern wolves across the Alps . ''

		A text from
Carducci	PERSON	supplied
Signor Martini	PERSON	's peroration : '' Fremono freschi i pini per l'aura grande di
Roma	LOCATION	, Tu dove sei , poeta del liberato mondo ? ''

		The Italian poet asked his question of
Shelley	PERSON	's urn ; the Italian statesman answered it at the shrine newly dedicated to
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's memory .

		Mr.
Arthur Severn	PERSON	, as the last speaker , told of the closing weeks of
Keats	PERSON	's life , as he had often heard the tale from the lips of his own father .

		The King then pronounced the formula of dedi - cation , and the proceedings were over .

		Their purport was afterwards summed up in these simple and sincere verses by Mr.
Harold Boulton	PERSON	: '' From
Britain	LOCATION	, Empress of the worldwide seas , And from that proud republic of the West , The new Atlantis of our latter day , In
April	DATE	tide to
Rome	LOCATION	came embassies To greet two makers of sweet melodies , Where shreds of their mortality find rest Mid cypress trees and groves of poet 's bay , And loving hearts keep green their memories .

		We , lovers of our poets and
Italy	LOCATION	, Are as their children 's sons as men count years ; These years , to them who soar in Fame 's wide spheres , Are but one wing-beat in eternity . ''

		The furnishings of the memorial rooms have been provided by the
New York Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in memory of
E.C. Stedman	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the late General
W. J. Palmer	PERSON	of
Colorado Springs	LOCATION	, Mr.
W. K. Bixby	PERSON	of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and the
Woman 's Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	.

		The other contents include works of art , personal relics , autograph letters , various manuscripts , and a library already numbering a thousand titles , to which it is expected a second thousand will soon be added .

		The committee has wisely decided to extend the scope of the Memorial to all the English poets having close associations with
Italy	LOCATION	, in consequence of which decision the collection already includes some material relating to
Byron	PERSON	and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	.

		We trust that it will in time be made to include
Landor	PERSON	, the
Brownings	LOCATION	, and
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		We have hardly as yet had any American poet of high importance -LRB- with the possible exception of
Longfellow	LOCATION	-RRB- , whose Italian associations would warrant admission to this distinguished com - pany .

		But the centuries may remedy even this defect in our record .

		The greater part of the Bulletin now pub - lished is devoted to a catalogue of the library , and a reprint of the letters acquired for the archives .

		Of this hitherto unpublished mate - rial , the most interesting part is found in a group of letters by
Trelawny	LOCATION	, relating in part to
Shelley	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	, and in part to his own adventurous enterprises .

		Letters by
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	,
Byron	PERSON	, Severn , and
Trelawny	LOCATION	are reproduced in photographic facsimile .

		An etching of the house , and two photogravure views of interiors , complete the list of illustrations .

		The Bulletin has thus documentary value on its own account , besides fulfilling its function as a record of the history of a peculiarly praiseworthy enterprise , now brought to a happy consummation .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 THE FIRST AMERICAN STUDENTS IN
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		A fresh reading of
George Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's letters from
Germany	LOCATION	, as they appear in an attractive new edi - tion of his '' Life , Letters , and Journals , '' published by Messrs.
Houghton Mifflin	PERSON	Go .

		and provided with an Introduction by Mr.
Ferris Greenslet	PERSON	, recalls a period in the intellectual development of this country which is full of interest for the present generation , when so many American students are earning their Ph.D. 's in German universities .

		The influence of the German mind over the American mind has played so great a role in our intellectual and educational history that any facts pertaining to its establishment are of interest and value .

		When the time comes to measure the importance and extent of this influ - ence , these letters of
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	will be a valuable source of material .

		It was in
August	DATE	.

		1815 , when the young Bos - tonian whom Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	calls our first cosmo - politan scholar arrived in
Gottingen	LOCATION	, where he was to learn the real meaning of scholarship .

		Ticknor was , however , not the first American student to enter a German university , although the first to leave a published record of his experiences .

		Benja - min
Smith Barton	PERSON	, of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, later an eminent physician and author of scientific works , had pre - ceded him at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, and had taken his doctor 's degree there in
1799	DATE	; also
W. B. Astor	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, and
Edward Everett	PERSON	, whom he found there on his arrival , preparing himself for the Greek pro- fessorship in
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an interesting fact that
Ticknor	PERSON	did not obtain his first knowledge of
Gottingen	LOCATION	from any one of these three countrymen , but from
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	's work on
Germany	LOCATION	.

		This famous book , which first saw the light in
England	LOCATION	in
1813	DATE	, dis - covered intellectual and spiritual
Germany	LOCATION	not only for
France	LOCATION	, but for the English-speaking world as well .

		The pitiful ignorance of the German language and literature prevailing in this country at that time is shown by
Ticknor	PERSON	's account of his difficulties in obtaining some preliminary knowledge of the lan - guage of the country where he had decided to study .

		There was no one in
Boston	LOCATION	who could teach him .

		In
Jamaica Plains	LOCATION	he found an Alsatian , a teacher of mathematics , who was willing to help him , but who warned him that he spoke a dialect .

		He bor - rowed a grammar , French and German , from Ed - ward Everett : sent to
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, where he knew there was a German dictionary , and obtained it ; and after much seeking got hold of a copy of ■ • Werther '' for a reading-book .

		At
Gottingen	LOCATION	the young scholar from over-seas found the leading university of
Germany	LOCATION	, if not of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Founded by
George the Second	ORGANIZATION	, the university had enjoyed the special protection of the English crown until
Hanover	LOCATION	was incorporated into
Westphalia	LOCATION	under
Jerome Bonaparte	PERSON	.

		While
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon was pillaging the universities of
Jena	PERSON	,
Halle	PERSON	, and
Leipzig	LOCATION	, he spared
Gottingen	LOCATION	, which , he declared , belonged neither to
Hanover	LOCATION	nor to
Germany	LOCATION	, but to the world .

		The
University	ORGANIZATION	was equally fortunate in escaping the clutches of
Jerome	PERSON	.

		Ticknor realized at once that he had entered a new world .

		Among the many distinguished scholars and teachers , he found two of international reputation -- Gauss the mathematician , and
Blumenbach	PERSON	the naturalist , who were attracting students from the whole of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		For the first time in his life , says his editor , `` he was made to understand and feel what is meant by instruction ; '' to know `` the difference between recit - ing to a man and being taught by him . ''

		In a letter to his father he thus writes of his Greek tutor Dr.
Schultze	PERSON	: • • Every day I am filled with new astonishment at the variety and accuracy , the minuteness and ieadiness of his learning .

		Every day I feel anew ... what a mortifying distance there is between a European and an American scholar !

		We do not yet know what a Greek scholar is ; we do not even know the process by which a man is to be made one .

		Mr.
Schultze	PERSON	is hardly older than I am .

		... It never entered into my imagination to conceive that any expense of time or talent could make a man so accomplished in this forgotten tongue as he is . ''

		The new-comer was also amazed by the prevailing industry .

		• If I desired to teach anybody the value of time , I would send him to spend a semester at
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		Until I began to attend the lectures , and go frequently into the streets , I had no idea of the accuracy with which it is measured and sold by the professors .

		Every clock that strikes is the signal for four or five lectures to begin and four or five others to close .

		In the intervals you may go into the streets and find they are silent and empty ; but the bell has hardly told the hour before they are filled with students , with their port - folios under their arms , hastening from the feet of one
Gamaliel	PERSON	to those of another , -- generally running , in order to save time ... As soon as they reach the room , they take their places and prepare their pens and paper .

		The pro- fessor comes in almost immediately , and from that time till he goes out .

		the sound of his disciples taking notes does not for an instant cease ... From the accuracy with which time is measured , what in all other languages is called a lesson is called in German * an hour . '

		You are never asked if you take lessons of such a person ; but whether yon take ; hours ' of him ... Visiting , as it is done in our -LSB- American -RSB- colleges , is a thing absolutely unknown here .

		If a man , who means to have any reputation as a scholar , sees his best friend once a week , it is thought quite often enough . ''

		The library of the university was a constant delight to the young student , as well as a reminder of the literary poverty of his own country .

		Speak - ing , after his return , of the library of
Harvard Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , he remarked : '' When I went away , I thought it was a large library when I came back , it seemed a closetful of books . ''

		The young barbarian from the West excited interest in the
Gottingen	LOCATION	world on his own part Endowed by nature with rare social gifts , he was received into the homes of his professors on terms of friendship .

		Together with his fellow-student ,
Everett	PERSON	, he was elected to the exclusive literary club of the university , a society composed of professors and a few chosen students .

		In reporting this honor to his father , he writes : '' W e were taken in as a kind of raree-show , I suppose .

		188 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, and we are considered , I doubt not , with much the same curiosity that a tame monkey or a dancing bear wonld be .

		We come from such an immense distance , that it is supposed we can be hardly civilized ; and it is , I am told , a matter of astonishment to many that we are white . ''

		The young American himself may have been a '' raree-show '' for several distinguished visitors of the university of whom we catch glimpses in the letters .

		One of them was
Wolf	PERSON	, '' the corypheus of German philologists , '' of whom he writes : '' He was curious about our country , and questioned me about our scholars and our scholarship .

		I told him what I could , -- - amongst other things , of a fashionable dashing preacher of
New York	LOCATION	having told me that he took great plea - sure in reading the choruses of JEschylus , and that he read them without the aid of a dictionary !

		I was walking with
Wolf	PERSON	at the time , and on hearing this he stopped , squared round , and said , ' He told you that , did he ? ' '

		Yes , ' I answered . '

		Very well ; the next time you hear him say it , do you tell him he lies , and that I say so . ' ''

		Ticknor was not in pursuit of a degree ; and after a residence of twenty months he set out again on his travels , carrying with him an unanswered letter of great moment , the offer of the professorships of the French and Spanish languages and of Belles Lettres at
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Soon after his return from
Europe	LOCATION	in
1819	DATE	, he was inducted with solemn cere - mony into these new professorships .

		At
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, then a college of twenty teachers and three hundred students ,
Ticknor	PERSON	found a state of affairs which would have completely discouraged a man of less ardent and optimistic temperament .

		The methods of instruc - tion were antiquated , the discipline weak ; the govern - ing bodies had fallen into a state of laisser-faire , which made any change a slow and painful process .

		The reforms proposed by the new professor caused a great rattling among the dry bones at
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		But the authorities had no taste for methods made in
Germany	LOCATION	, and the changes went no farther than his own department .

		But if
Ticknor	PERSON	did not have the gratification of seeing many of his suggestions adopted , to him belongs the honor of giving the initial impulse to the reforms which were finally to change into a university the institution which at that time did not deserve the name of college .

		Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	calls him `` the originator of the university idea in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Edward
Everett	PERSON	, whom
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	had left behind at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, soon came home , bringing with him more German books for the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library than all the rest of
New England	LOCATION	possessed .

		As soon as he was established as professor of Greek , one of his first acts was to urge upon the president of the col - lege the desirability of founding a travelling scholar - ship for the purpose of having some promising young scholar in training abroad for service to his alma mater .

		The suggestion was acted upon , and the choice fell upon
George Bancroft	PERSON	, then in his eighteenth year .

		After three years in
Gottingen	LOCATION	,
Bancroft	PERSON	returned to his native country , in
1820	DATE	, with the degree of doctor of philosophy .

		For a year he was tutor at
Harvard	LOCATION	; but failed to receive a permanent appointment , and was also , somewhat later , refused permission to read lectures on history after the German privat docent method , a privilege which would have been granted him in
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		Thus
Bancroft	PERSON	's efforts to introduce an important feature of the German university was unsuccessful , and the future historian of his country never lent the distinction of his name to the faculty roll of its leading university .

		But the would-be reformer of his college is nevertheless entitled to a place in the history of American education .

		With Dr.
Joseph Green Cogswell	PERSON	, also the holder of a degree from
Gottingen	LOCATION	, he founded in
1823	DATE	, at
Northampton	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, the famous
Round Hill School	ORGANIZATION	which was largely based upon German ideas .

		After the way had been pointed out , the aspiring young scholars of
America	LOCATION	began to realize that '' homekeeping youths have ever homely wits , '' and to follow those pioneers in ever-increasing numbers .

		It is a noticeable fact that
Gottingen	LOCATION	was the shrine of most of those early pilgrimages .

		For the year
1829	DATE	the Book of the
American Colony	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- an organiza - tion which still exists -RRB- shows the name of
Longfellow	LOCATION	followed under the rubric of '' Faculty '' by ''
Schone	PERSON	- wissenschaft , '' an excellent term for the refined learning of
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's successor at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other distinguished names on the colony 's roll-book are
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was at
Gottingen	LOCATION	that
Motley	ORGANIZATION	formed his famous friendship with
Bismarck	PERSON	.

		Like his predecessors , he had already finished his college course at home , which fact , however , had not made him too serious-minded for the peculiar pleasures of a German fighting corps .

		After his death , the Iron Chancellor , in a letter to Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, wrote of his old corpsbruder that he studied more than most corps members ; also that he attempted original German poems and had planned a translation of Goethe 's '' Faust . ''

		In an account of those early Americans at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, mention should also be made of
F. H. Hedge	PERSON	, whom Dr.
Harris	PERSON	has called '' the great German scholar thoroughly equipped and fully possessed of the German spirit , the German fountain among the Transcendentalists . ''

		The reader may ask why these first Americans chose the German universities instead of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		One would suppose , without further thought , that
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	`` with her dreaming spires '' would have been the intellectual Mecca of such men as
Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	and
Longfellow	LOCATION	.

		The explanation is not far to seek : the English universities have never treated foreign students with liberality ; nor did their peculiar character at the time in question permit of that universality of learning which
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	emphasized as characteristic of the universities of
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		Their teaching begins , '' she wrote , `` where that of most other nations ends . ''

		To trace the full significance and influence of the ideas brought back from
Germany	LOCATION	by these first Americans who went there for study will be an important duty of the future historian of American culture .

		THE DIAL 189 CASUAL COMMENT .

		The axxual reports of the
Carnegie Foun	ORGANIZATION	- dation * have within a short time come to he looked forward to as important expressions of opinion upon current problems of higher education .

		The report for
1909	DATE	is no exception to this rule , and brings some very pertinent comments upon college adver - tising , upon financial statements , upon politics in
State	LOCATION	universities , and upon the significance of agri - cultural education .

		But there is one item in the report that is certain to command far more general attention than any of these , and , indeed , is likely to cause consternation in academic circles and to arouse a decided word of protest wherever academic interests are cherished .

		The Dial is able to refer with pleasure to its strong words of commendation of the purposes of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	when the meas - ures adopted to promote its aims were first an - nounced ; and now , after an experience of only four years , it regrets to see one of the two fundamental policies , which gave to professors the right of retire - ment after twenty-five years of service , suddenly and unexpectedly withdrawn .

		The withdrawal is unaccompanied by word of regret , or even of excuse for its immediate execution .

		Retirements under this clause are in the future to be limited to cases of disability ; and it is set forth that because only a small proportion of those who have in three or four years availed themselves of this privilege did so by reason of disability , the result is widely different from what was anticipated .

		Yet there is nothing in the original regulations which suggests disability as a prime cause for retirement .

		Indeed , the whole set of reasons given to support the decision seem so slight as to suggest the presence of a far more decisive factor in the probable inadequacy of the funds .

		Now it is a most dangerous policy in uni - versity administration to give one set of reasons , when in reality the situation is urgent , in terms of a very different set .

		The old injunction to hold separate that which is
Caesar 's	ORGANIZATION	and that which has higher responsibilities , is not out of place here .

		It must be evident that an announcement that pro- fessors may look forward to retiring upon either one of two bases which they may personally prefer , is equivalent to a promise : and that in view of such a promise , the lives and activities of a small but worthy part of influential communities will be pro- foundly affected .

		A number of protests against the proposed change have already appeared , and all point to the conclusion that the only way for the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	to restore confidence in its policies is to postpone the execution of this decision until it is made financially necessary .

		It is particularly im - portant that the present obligation which the Foun - dation has accepted in regard to those men who in five or ten years would look forward to shaping their careers with reference to the use of this privi - lege , shall not be evaded .

		It is certainly a most regrettable situation that an institution which was distinctly created to advance the cause of learning and make more favorable the conditions under which the academic life in this country is followed , should so early in its career have aroused a situation the more aggravating because of a benefit conferred and withdrawn .

		It is inevitable that such a situa - tion will draw forth , and above all from the friends i of the
Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, a most earnest protest for a reconsideration of this unfortunate decision .

		The rain returning after the cloud might j be a paraphrase from Scripture to describe the process by which great reservoirs of wealth -- ; accumulated by an alchemy scarcely less subtle and mysterious than that by which moisture from the earth is sucked up into elouds -- when over - charged yield back their treasures to the source whence they came .

		How much of credit is dne to the clouds that `` bring fresh showers for the thirsting flowers '' by discharging moisture they can I no longer hold , and how much to the owners of the wealth restored , is a matter less vital than the : fact of restoration .

		Considerations of practical wis - dom , if nothing more , dictate full recognition of 1 acts tending toward public good .

		For such acts , I two men in
America	LOCATION	have long been preeminent ; and now one of them , Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	, has opened wider still the gates of his seemingly inexhaustible reservoir for purposes of beneficence that might almost be described as the general amelioration of mankind .

		A bill incorporating `` The Rockefeller Foundation , '' a sort of friendly rival to the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, has been introduced in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and referred to the
Senate District Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the words of the document , the object in view is `` to promote the well-being and to advance the civiliza - tion of the people of the
United States	LOCATION	and its Territories and possessions , and of foreign lands , in the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge , in the prevention and relief of suffering , and in the i promotion of any and all the elements of human progress . ''

		The reported intention of Mr.
Rocke	PERSON	- feller to give away most of his wealth in his lifetime seems in a fair way to be carried out .

		If it is his ambition to die a poor man , while most of the rest of us are foolishly nursing the contrary aspiration , the cause of learning and enlightenment , of progress and of charity , appears likely to profit materially thereby .

		The end of a famous journalistic dynasty which comprised four generations and dated from

		The tale since then of chancery proceedings , of various alien enterprises essayed by the journal -LRB- notably the u Times Book Club '' and the '' Encyclopaedia Brit - annica '' reprint -RRB- , and of other indications of a loss of solidity and prestige , must have been not exactly a joyous one to the late Mr.

		The Times '' without its

		The making of poets and dramatists is now a part of the programme of the fully equipped uni - versity .

		This is to-day a course in good and regular standing in the college on the
Charles	LOCATION	, under Professor
George P. Baker	PERSON	's competent direction ; and the number of recent Harvard graduates who have achieved greater or less distinction in the writing of plays , whether for the stage or the closet , seems to indicate that at least encouragement and wise coun - sel are to be had from the professor of the dramatic art -- who may himself never have written an acting play in his life .

		The endeavor is now being made to endow a professorship of dramatic literature at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and to raise money for the building of a suitable theatre for the use of the
Harvard Dramatic Association	ORGANIZATION	... The restoration of Homer to his old-time throne on the very peak of
Parnassus	LOCATION	, whence
Wolf	PERSON	and later disbelievers in any such man as Homer had hurled him down as an empty impostor , a mere name and nothing more , has been at least partially effected by a little pamphlet in which Pro- fessor
John A. Scott of Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	adduces proof to show that the disputed ninth , tenth , twenty-third , and twenty-fourth books of the Iliad contain no more peculiar or suspiciously recent terms than do the other books .

		This scholarly attempt to give us back our blind bard is appre - ciatively welcomed by no less a Grecian and Homeric scholar than Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, who con - tributes to the
London	LOCATION	`` Morning Post '' a com - mendatory and interesting column on the general subject of Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's pamphlet , and adds in closing : '' Meanwhile , an English scholar ,
Miss Stawell	PERSON	, of
Newnham College	ORGANIZATION	, has done for the comparative grammar and metre of the Iliad and Odyssey what Mr.
Scott	PERSON	has done for the vocabulary , with the same results , in her ` Homer and the Iliad . '

		Thus the higher criticism may be said to have collapsed . ''

		The
Southern Library Training School	ORGANIZATION	, established five years ago by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, and since
1907	DATE	known as the
Library Training School of the Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Atlanta	LOCATION	, issues a small and business-like '' Circular of Information , '' from which we learn that it now enjoys a permanent income of four thousand
five hundred dollars	MONEY	-- thanks to its founder -- and has a Faculty of seven , all women .

		Its course covers three terms , extend - ing from late
September	DATE	to the end of
May	DATE	, and amounting to 464 hours of classroom work .

		The subjects taught are grouped under seven general heads , and seem well selected to cover the essentials of library science .

		The school can not , of course , expect to turn out in one year a ready-made
Panizzi	PERSON	or Poole or Putnam ; but there appears no reason why the young person who has it in him or her to become a librarian should not get a fair start at the
Atlanta	LOCATION	school .

		The moderateness of the expense involved is an attractive feature of the course .

		There is still in the
South	LOCATION	abundant room for library training schools , as there is also for libraries .

		The persistence of poetry , despite the insig - nificance of the material reward offered to even the most successful of poets , is a thing which may make the aspiring poet take heart again .

		The amount of verse , and good verse , now being published in En - gland is by no means small ; and the amount seek - ing publication is many times larger .

		Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	, writing in the '' Nineteenth Century , '' com - pares the present age with the period immediately succeeding
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death ; both alike showing a great variety of genuine and delightful poetry .

		He makes a study of two recent poets , Messrs.
James Stephens	PERSON	and
W. H. Davies	PERSON	, and maintains that good verse , however limited its sale , has a far better chance of being remembered -- of achieving immortality , we might say -- than any prose writing of corresponding excellence .

		The novel , the book of essays , the his - tory , the biography , please most at the first reading , and seldom do they receive a second ; but the poem gives increasing pleasure the oftener it is read .

		• • • `` Making culture hum '' with the humming wheels of industry seems to be a matter of keen concern in the educational world just now , if we may judge from the advertisements of not a few academies and colleges and even universities .

		In his current report , President
Pritchett	PERSON	of the Car - negie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching animadverts upon certain features of college adver - tising .

		The transgression of the bounds of aca - demic propriety , and even of common decency , in the effort to draw students , is much deplored .

		Among certain more or less astonishing or amusing devices noted by Dr.
Pritchett	PERSON	as resorted to by some of our enterprising institutions of learning , we read the following alluring offer from a

		THE '' BEST SELLER ■ AND ROMANCE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Is n't the contributor who writes of the `` genteel atmosphere '' of the '' best seller '' a little too hard on the reading public ?

		Is it the gentility of high life that they crave , or the romance ?

		And surely the craving for romance is a legitimate emotion , and the greatest art , as well as the most flagrant artifice , satisfies it .

		For my part , I do n't believe it is because we are such snobs that we like to read about princes and heiresses , motor-cars , European tours , Worth gowns , and expen - sive cafe 's ; it is because we are romantic .

		We can ` t , in this matter-of-fact age , thoroughly believe in fairies ,
Alladin	PERSON	's lamp , white magic , and all the other pleasant possibilities that in the '' good old days '' used to alle - viate the unendurable commonplaceness of humdrum existence .

		But one magic power is still left us -- money .

		We see it -- we who have n't it -- oiling the wheels to wonderful speed and efficiency . ''

		Life `` s a gift scarce worth receivin ' , And we hae muckle care and gTievin ' ; But , oiled by thee , The wheels o ' life gang down-hill , scrievin 1 Wi ' rattlin ' glee . '' '

		Money brings mountains to Mahomet or Mahomet to the mountains , according as Mahomet decrees ; trans - forms ugliness to beauty , dullness to piquant adventure .

		We know , in our sober senses , that this modern magic has its limitations -- that there are many things it ca n't give its fortunate possessors ; but we would like to try , for once in a way , what it could do for us , with our talents , our ingenuity , our zest for the joy of living .

		Of course that is the real magic , ancient or modern , -- zest for the joy of living ; but it would be too much to expect of the average man that he should find it out , or even believe it ; money-magic appeals to his material mind .

		And so , while craving for romance remains a leading motive in the doings of this work-a-day world , the beggar-maid can not get into the '' best seller '' -- unless she marries the
King	LOCATION	.

		The realist may depict the weary round of petty tasks with wonderful adroit - ness and discrimination ; he will never write a '' best seller . ''

		So I consider the '' genteel atmosphere '' too Philistine an expression .

		I should state the formula of the '' best seller '' thus : a presentation of people like ourselves , doing what we want to do , in places where we want to be , -- and that , for most of us , unanalytic and little experienced in the ironies of life , means in places where the modern magic doth much abound , not because it is '' genteel '' to be rich , but because it is , as we thoughtlessly suppose , delightfully , unbelievably romantic .

		-LSB- Apparently Mr.
Welsh	PERSON	does not quite apprehend the difficulty pointed out by oar previous correspond - ent , who complained that in reading books of poetry he often was perplexed by the absence of any - thing at the bottom of a page to indicate at a glance whether the last line completed a stanza , or the stanza was divided at that point and carried over to the next page .

		This applies particularly , of course , to stanzas of different lengths , and when the hist line on a page ends with a period .

		We do not see that the catch - word would help the matter in the example given , the comma and the single line being sufficient indica - tion of a divided stanza .

		Nor would Mr.
House	PERSON	's suggestion of a blank line at the bottom of a page and another at the top of the following one be practically effective .

		The confusion arises , of course , from the fact that usage gives no other means of dividing stanzas than their separation by much more blank space than that used between other lines in the same book .

		Unless dashes or dots , or other mechanical signs , are used to separate stanzas , the evil will have to be endured ; although it is one that affects , whether they understand it or not , all careful readers of poetry .

		I wish someone could inform me what he believes to be the origin of that lugubrious stock phrase , '' in the cold and silent grave . ''

		Does it belong to some frater - nity ritual , some early dirge or hymn , some novel or history , -- or what ?

		It certainly is not of the
Bible	LOCATION	, nor of

		Turning the words over in one 's mind , they do take on , as our correspondent says , `` the sound of a threadbare adage . ''

		Did not

		* The source of the Indus has for centuries lain hidden in the mountain fastnesses of the great central plateau of
Asia	LOCATION	, as secure from the contaminating gaze of the European explorer as is still Dangra-yum-tso , the sacred lake of the Tibetans .

		But the head-waters of the Indus , the
Brahmaputra	LOCATION	, and the Sutlej have at last been mapped by the dreaded foreigner , though the intrepid
Sven Hedin	PERSON	still finds every ap - proach to the lake of holy waters barred by armed horsemen .

		Travelling in
Tibet	LOCATION	evidently lacks the com - forts of home , and offers no substitutes save the satisfaction of leaving on the map of
Asia	LOCATION	the record of a massive range of mountains happily christened the '' Trans-Himalaya , '' of completing the survey of the head - waters of three great rivers of the continent , and of filling in the geographic details of certain bands across that great white place on the map which for - merly bore only the laconic label '' Unexplored . ''

		It is cold in
Tibet	LOCATION	, even in
summer	DATE	.

		The monsoon blows incessantly day and night .

		The snows begin early in autumn and continue till late in the

Hedin	PERSON	's route on the great plateau was all of it at an altitude exceeding 12,000 feet , and often over 18,000 .

		For two years , through
summer	DATE	's blinding storms and winter 's baffling snows , he pushed doggedly on , wearing out caravan after caravan of horses , mules , yaks , even goats and sheep , in a grim battle with the forces of nature , crossing and re-crossing eight different passes of the Trans -
Himalaya	ORGANIZATION	range .

		The reader is compelled by the modesty of the writer to re-read the simple account of his mid-winter battle with the ele - ments in the desert and desolate
Karokorum Mountains	LOCATION	, in order to appreciate fully the magnitude of the task and the success of its accomplishment .

		Obliged by the secret nature of his enterprise to discard most of the appur - tenances of the civilization to which he had bidden farewell a year before , accompanied by a mere handful of ignorant but faithful Lada - kis , without guides in a trackless wilderness of snowclad peaks , he brought the remnant of his little caravan through by sheer force of leader - * Trans-Himalaya : Discoveries and Adventures in

		Conditions of temperature , altitude , and storm tested the powers of human endurance almost as severely as in polar explorations .

		The courage with which
Hedin	PERSON	attempted to penetrate these unknown mountain fastnesses in the dead of winter at altitudes towering far above Alpine summits is not less than sublime .

		He has made Trans-Himalayan the superlative of Alpine in the vocabulary of mountaineering .

		The desert is swept by blinding dust and sand storms ; water is scanty and found with diffi - culty , and then all too often bitter or salt .

		Nomads ' trails are followed at one 's peril , while fuel and fodder are scarce ; for
Tibet	LOCATION	is much of it a treeless desert .

		There is no playing to the galleries in
Hedin	PERSON	's portrayal of the thrilling parts of his narrative .

		A touch of rhetorical effect is reserved for the sentimental treatment which he gives to the loss of his faithful beasts of burden or to the various and sundry litters of puppies added to his cara - van , for the reflections on the lives of the self - immured lamas , or for the gruesome details of the revolting customs which the Tibetans use in the disposal of their dead .

		The narrative of his travels is detailed and encyclopaedic .

		He sees
Tibet	LOCATION	through a geographer 's eyes , and describes it with geographical completeness .

		No particu - lar of elevation , orographic structure , or rate of flow of stream , no configuration of distant moun - tain range , escapes his nimble recording pencil .

		He fairly revels in geographic detail ; the hur - ried or casual reader can hardly see
Tibet	LOCATION	for the landscape .

		It is but fair to characterize the book as one of exploration rather than travel , of information rather than mere entertainment .

		The pages afford abundant and carefully re - corded data regarding the country and people along the routes , enlivened continually by the minor details of human interest , by the minutiae of caravan life , of his horses , yaks , and dogs , and even of his sheep , which often served as refractory beasts of burden when horses and yaks failed .

		One soon comes to know the mem - bers of his caravan , -- the intelligent
Robert	PERSON	from the mission station at
Srinagar	LOCATION	, the only Eurasian in his following ; the efficient
Muhamed Isa	PERSON	, his caravan bashi ; and crafty Panchor , the grafting guide , friend of all the nomad robbers .

		His followers , in spite of the perils into which he led them , and great physical discomforts to which they were subjected , gave him yeoman service , and parted from him with tears and lamentations .

		Mountain chains , swift icy rivers , trackless wind-swept salty deserts , deep snow , and shortage

		THE DIAL 193 of fuel and water , were not the only obstacles
Hedin	PERSON	had to overcome .

		Tibet was closed to all foreigners , by formal agreement of four nations noted for their astute diplomacy --
Tibet	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		All appeals to the
Liberal Government	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	for permission to enter the forbidden land by way of
India	LOCATION	met with courteous but firm refusal .

		Baffled at
Simla	LOCATION	in his efforts to enter from the south , he plunged into
Kashmir	LOCATION	and entered
Tibet	LOCATION	from the northwest , reaching
Shigatse	LOCATION	, one hundred and fifty miles from
Lhasa	LOCATION	, through the sparsely - peopled country of the nomad tribes , before the Tibetan authorities stopped him and firmly com - pelled him to leave the country .

		A diplomatic battle-royal ensued , in which the explorer 's '' religious scruples '' against returning by the route by which he entered stood him in good stead ; for Tibetans are the most religious people in the world , and gave his geographical conscience its just dues in so far that they permitted him to zigzag his way back to the
Kashmir	LOCATION	frontier along a formerly explored route .

		A new agreement of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, in which
China	LOCATION	was requested to concur , expressly forbade for a period of three years all scientific expeditions into
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		This rendered doubly difficult all attempts to creep back into the forbidden land .

		The author says : '' The country of
Tibet	ORGANIZATION	will doubtless in the future be closed as strictly as hitherto ; for the supremacy over
Tibet	LOCATION	is a political question of the first importance to
China	LOCATION	, not ouly because
Tibet	LOCATION	is , as it were , a huge fortress with ramparts , walls , and ditches , protecting
China	LOCATION	, but also on account of the great spiritual iufluence which the two popes exercise over all Mongolians .

		As long as
China	LOCATION	has the
Dalai Lama	ORGANIZATION	in its power , it can keep the Mongols in check ; while in other circumstances the
Dalai Lama	ORGANIZATION	could stir them up to insurrection against
China	LOCATION	.

		And
Mongolia	LOCATION	is also the buffer-state between
China	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		A new caravan was , however , secretly equipped in
Kashmir	LOCATION	which , starting ostensibly northward , plunged again in mid-winter into
Western Tibet	LOCATION	through the uninhabited wastes of Kuen-Lun , only to be stopped again after crossing once more the Trans - Himalayan range , and ordered post - haste from the land .

		Once more '' religious '' scruples and clever diplomacy won for
Hedin	PERSON	the privilege of a circuitous route outward , and made possible a number of important additions to the maps of
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		The two bulky volumes of the present work do not afford opportunity for the full story of the return trip and the difficult traverse of the Himalayas by a new route .

		This , with an account of Tibetan monasteries , and of the trip through
Japan	LOCATION	,
Korea	LOCATION	, and
Manchuria	LOCATION	, is prom - ised in a later work ; while the youthful appetite for adventure is to be supplied by a selection of thrilling Tibetan experiences .

		The illustrations of the work are exceptionally fine and very abundant .

		The author 's sketches are confessedly not works of art , but they give a vivid impression of the atmospheric color - effects in this great plateau , and of scenes in the great monastery of
Shigatse	LOCATION	, while also enliven - ing and enlarging the reader 's appreciation of places , peoples , and incidents .

		Few books of exploration contain so much information so well told as these volumes of
Hedin	ORGANIZATION	's about the For - bidden Land .

Porto Rico	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	to 1 the
United States	LOCATION	and in the establishment of l substantial American control over
Cuba	LOCATION	, has | already formed the topic of a large literature .

		Of this literature , much , as might be expected where the matter deals with events so close at hand , is partisan ; much is incomplete ; and still i more lacks the higher intellectual authority and judgment which come from the larger view possible only where events are placed in their true perspective with reference to others by being viewed down a vista of years .

		Admiral
Chadwick	PERSON	's volume on the diplomatic relations of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	is an acceptable and valuable contribution to the growing body of material dealing with the Spanish war , and it has the additional merit -LRB- as the title intimates -RRB- of presenting a study of our recent relations with
Spain	LOCATION	simply as the latest steps in a long series of negotiations extending back to '' diffi - culties which had their seed in the peace of I

		The book has thus a broad historical ' quality which marks it out as more than a con - tribution to contemporary politics , although of I its 610 pages about a third are devoted to the years 1895-1898 .

		Admiral
Chadwick	PERSON	, after a general introduc - ; tion , begins with a chapter on the attitude of

		Napoleon 's invasion of
Spain	LOCATION	and its effect in this country , the relations of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, Spanish land-grants , and the position of the
United States	LOCATION	regarding these questions and the South American situation , carry Admiral
Chad wick	PERSON	to the end of his eighth chapter .

		His ninth section is an interesting discussion of the
Holy Alliance	ORGANIZATION	,
Canning	ORGANIZATION	's posi - tion on American affairs , and the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Verona	LOCATION	.

		This leads by natural stages to the development of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	and the origin of the
Panama Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our attitude toward slavery and the Cuban question , and our assurances to
Spain	LOCATION	in
1840	DATE	and the following years , are then dealt with .

		Admiral
Chad	PERSON	wick gives substantial attention to Cuban affairs , and continues with a valuable discussion of the rela - tions of
Cuba	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	during the decade 1850-1860 , which brings his history to the opening of the Civil War , and closes his thirteenth chapter .

		The author recognizes the important bearing which our abolition of slavery had upon the Cuban question , and this recogni - tion shows itself throughout his subsequent dis - cussion of our dealings with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		He reviews with care and detail President
Grant	PERSON	's Cuban views , the position of Secretary Fish , and the events which ultimately led to the disturbances in
Cuba	LOCATION	and to our forcible interference .

		In all these matters the great merit of Admiral
Chadwick	PERSON	's book is seen in his reliance upon state papers and direct historical sources ; while the main criticism on his use of material must be that he has apparently employed but little Spanish documentary information .

		The chief immediate interest in this study of our relations with
Spain	LOCATION	will , however , lie largely in Admiral
Chadwick	PERSON	's later chapters in which he deals with the events subsequent to
1895	DATE	.

		Here he has considered at length the attitude of the
Cleveland	LOCATION	administration toward the Cuban question and the Spanish government generally , the policy of Secretary
Olney	PERSON	,
Spain	LOCATION	's lack of un - derstanding of the feeling in the
United States	LOCATION	, the position assumed by President
McKinley	PERSON	, the condition of the Cuban people ,
General Weyler	PERSON	, his policy and his final recall , the regime established by
Consul General Lee	ORGANIZATION	in
Cuba	LOCATION	and his relations with the military authori - ties there , the destruction of the
Maine	LOCATION	, the find - ings of the court of inquiry thereon , conditions at
Madrid	LOCATION	, and the opening of the war .

		It is one of the most interesting features of this part of the work , that Admiral
Chadwick	PERSON	concedes fully and frankly that
Spain	LOCATION	had by the begin - ning of
April	DATE	, before the final break which led to war , practically accepted American demands with regard to
Cuba	LOCATION	, in full .

		Much of the mat - ter in this portion of the volume is , in fact , a transcript of documentary matter carefully selected and put together .

		He regards the war as '' the final act in the struggle for supremacy between Anglo-Saxons and men of the Latin race in

		THE DIAL 195 The Prophet of Modern Music * In the
year 1685	DATE	there were born in
Germany	LOCATION	two men whose future task it was to lay the foundation of the art which is distinctively that of modern times .

		Sculpture is Greek , architec - ture is ancient and mediaeval , painting belongs to the Renaissance , poetry is universal and free from time limitations : but music has reached its development in the last two centuries .

		The remarkable men referred to were Bach and
Handel	ORGANIZATION	.

		Born in the same year , they also took their flight from earth in the same decade .

		The one came of a long musical ancestry , the other relied upon his own inborn genius .

		They were engaged upon the same great task ; they were actuated by similar motives and purposes ; they made a noble contribution to the happiness and elevation of mankind .

		They united in themselves the best attain - ments of their predecessors , and they made con - quests that were impossible to earlier men .

		Music had been decisively developing in its elements and resources .

		The forms of the com - position , the perfection of the instruments , the upbuilding of structures vast and impressive , solicited the attention and determined the ener - gies of the followers of the art .

		Bach and
Handel	PERSON	came as the leaders and chief exponents of an art that had a numerous body of votaries .

		The instrument that was making extraordinary ad - vances was the organ ; the song that was chal - lenging the composer for its richer development was the religious choral ; the orchestra in its independence was making an appeal quite irre - sistible : the opera had found a congenial climate in
Italy	LOCATION	, and the Germans were eager and active in its introduction into their more serious land .

		There were remarkable executants and writers -- Frescobaldi , with his novel and brilliant audaci - ties ;
Pachelbel	ORGANIZATION	, possessing the Teutonic thorough - ness : and , greatest of all ,
Buxtehude	PERSON	, exercising a powerful influence on his students and followers .

		The young
John Sebastian Bach	PERSON	responded ardently to these stimulating demands , and felt able to bring to successful conclusion what the others were not yet ready to accomplish .

		He found himself the centre of a large and splendid activity , and his place was first among those who did the most and carried the art of music farthest on its way .

		He was born at
Eisenach	LOCATION	, in
Germany	LOCATION	, and came of a family of musicians .

Sebastian Bach	PERSON	.

		The Story of the Develop - ment of a
Great Personality	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
C. Hubert H. Parry	PERSON	.

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		the Bachs had been devoted to the art , and num - bered many notable men among their kindred .

		Their gifts all descended to the great man who made them partakers of his fame -- who concen - trated in himself all the tendencies of his time , and was the genuine forerunner and progenitor of that achievement in music which places it side by side with the highest artistic attainments of the world .

		Bach lost both parents while he was very young , and went to live with an older brother ,
John Christoph	PERSON	, who was a musician of some eminence , and who held an appoint - ment as organist in
Ohrdruff	LOCATION	, a village not far from
Eisenach	LOCATION	.

		Of this period in his life Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	says : '' In such a home new influences inevitably began to operate .

		Without laying undue stress on the difference between the art of a town musician and that of a musi - cian attached to a church establishment , it can not be gainsaid that the regular , quiet , orderly , and sober existence of an organist of a church , the peculiar artis - tic atmosphere , and the kind of work which falls to his lot to do , are liable to exert a great and basting influence upon the unfolding mind of a young musician .

		The better part of such influence is sobering .

		It leads to the concentration of the faculties upon the actual facts of art and to finding pleasure and reward in them rather than in the applause which brilliant individual achievement , either as performer or composer , may evoke .

		And under this influence it is easy to see that the character of the young musician soon received a permanent bent . ''

		The education of the youth was carefully attended to , but at best it was not anything that we should nowadays regard as adequate .

		He was a pupil of
Pachelbel	ORGANIZATION	's , and during his earlier life he made a number of expeditions to study with certain leading men , notably Bbhm and
Buxtehude	PERSON	, and with the latter he remained so long over his leave of absence that he was in danger of losing the post which he then held .

		Like
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Beethoven	PERSON	, his chief edu - cation came from his independent using and bringing to perfection of the great powers with which he found himself endowed , as soon as he arrived at self-consciousness .

		He was thrown upon his own resources early ; at the age of fifteen he held a position in the convent school of
St. Michael	ORGANIZATION	's at
Liineberg	LOCATION	, for which he received an insignificant stipend .

		He had sub - sequent appointments at Arnstadt , at
Weimar	LOCATION	, at
Cothen	ORGANIZATION	, and at last went to Leipsic and was made cantor of the
St. Thomas School	ORGANIZATION	, a place which he held until his death in
1750	DATE	.

		He was also organist of the two leading churches in
Leipsic	LOCATION	.

		He was twice married , and left a large number of children , some of whom attained considerable musical distinction .

		He was a man 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, of sturdy independence of character , serious and deeply religious ; he was honored at his death , but his full recognition was left to men and times that succeeded him .

		The period of
Bach	PERSON	's novitiate closed with his call to
Weimar	LOCATION	in
1708	DATE	.

		He had attained his Meisterschaft , and now began the mature period of his splendor as a composer .

		He was an indefatigable worker ; his creative power came from an apparently inexhaustible source , and his productions -- cantatas , motets , tocca - tas , fugues , passion music , masses -- proceeded in a never-ending stream .

		His life broadened and deepened at
Weimar	LOCATION	; he came in contact with the reigning
Duke	ORGANIZATION	, he found himself in association with men of his own type and tem - perament .

		Moreover , the Protestantism there was of the Orthodox rather than the Pietist kind .

		As the present biographer says : '' He -LRB- the Duke of
Weimar	LOCATION	-RRB- belonged to the group which was distinguished technically as being orthodox , among whose objects it was to main - tain the ancient musical traditions of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, as distinguished from the Pietists , to whom anything in the shape of artistic accesso - ries and appeals to the poetic imagination was abhorrent .

		So in this respect
John Sebastian	PERSON	was sure of a field to exercise his powers . ''

		During the
Weimar	LOCATION	period Bach sounded the heights and depths of the cantata .

		He unfolded this form as no man before him had done , and he fashioned a unity of chorals which practically brought into the world a new work of art .

		Some of his greatest achievements belong to this time .

		Toccatas and fugues and fantasies of astonishing amplitude gave evidence of his mas - tery .

		He had become conscious of his art and its infinite resources .

		Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	finds it somewhat difficult to assign a reason for
Bach	PERSON	's willingness to leave
Weimar	LOCATION	, where so much had been to his mind , and where such successes had been won .

		The reasons were probably more subjective than would strike the simple on-looker .

		At
Cothen	PERSON	a new field of his art allured him .

		The organ should not exclusively call him devotee ; the larger opportunities of the orchestra were open - ing to him .

		Composers before him and around him , in
Italy	LOCATION	and in
Germany	LOCATION	, --
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	, Scar - latti ,
Reinken	PERSON	, -- were bringing into play the special characteristics and resources of the vari - ous instruments , and , as our author says : ''
Bach	PERSON	's energy in exploring the possibilities of secu - lar instrumental music during the time when he was at
Cothen	ORGANIZATION	seems to have been all-embracing .

		His oppor - tunities of hearing such music were plentiful , and there being no special inducements to write choral music on a grand scale , his mind was more free to address itself to various forms of this large branch of art . ''

		So we get his concertos and suites for different instruments , his overtures , his sonatas , accom - panied or unaccompanied , for the violin , and his epoch-making '' Wohltemperirtes Clavier . ''

		The next step will of course be to put all these musical resources together .

		But before that occurs , there is another migration , the last , to a larger field of labor .

		He takes up his sojourn in
Leipsic	LOCATION	, where he remains until his death .

		He succeeded
Kuhnau	PERSON	, a versatile and distin - guished musician , as cantor of the
Thomas Schule	PERSON	, a foundation under the control of the
City Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		He now returns to the produc - tion of cantatas , but with the largeness and mas - tery that came from full maturity of power , and the high consciousness thereof .

		He also attains the recognition of the universality of the musical forms , and , although a consistent Protestant , pours his religious ardor into the moulds fur - nished by the
Church Catholic	ORGANIZATION	.

		To this period belong the chief successes of his career , the imposing Magnificat , the Mass in B minor to which no epithet except incomparable is applica - ble , and the wonderful
Matthew Passion Music	ORGANIZATION	.

		With these are to be grouped the Fugue in B minor , the grand Toccata in F , and the
Fantasia	LOCATION	in G minor .

		His work draws to a close , and his end is only another example of the ingratitude of an unthinking generation , and the failure of those near the benefactor to take him for what he is .

		Bach belongs with the great upbuilders of music ; it was his to give consistent form to the masses of material long accumulating , to seize upon the characteristics of instrument after instrument and find for each its place in the great whole , to show what could be done with the concerto , the sonata , the mass , and to bring them into that perfection of form which could alone lead to their setting forth their complete significance .

		With Palestrina as his genuine predecessor , and
Handel	PERSON	as his compeer and co - adjutor , he made of music a vehicle of expression not to be surpassed .

		He was both the consum - mation of what preceded him and the prophet of what was to come .

		No art had taken so long a time to ripen and mature as Music .

		He was the chosen instrumentality to bring its elements together .

		Of his musical accomplishment , Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	says : '' For over one hundred and fifty years since
Bach	PERSON	's death composers have been constantly endeavoring to enhance their artistic resources ; and yet with all their devoted and unsparing efforts they do not appear to
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 have got much beyond the standard of his achievements .

		In some respects indeed they seem like people who have turned aside from a path which appeared rather too arduous and have gone a long way round , only to find themselves after a long climb at much the same place as they started from . ''

		The opera was in full blast with
Reiser	PERSON	in the neighboring town of
Hamburg	LOCATION	, and
Bach	PERSON	visited there ; he also met the composer
Hasse	PERSON	, at
Dresden	LOCATION	.

		He was not allured , however , into any efforts in the direction which these men had taken .

		His great contemporary ,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	, spent years in the production of operas , but at last abandoned them for the serious work of his life .

		The music of
Italy	LOCATION	had some attraction for Bach ; the charm and fluency of its melody held him with its fascination , as they must hold everyone ; but he wove the lighter strands suc - cessfully into his stronger texture , and gave them such use and privilege as conduced to the fulfilment of his more strenuous aims .

		Poly - phony , of which he was the great master , has found a triumphant re-birth in
Beethoven	LOCATION	,
Wagner	PERSON	,
Strauss	PERSON	.

		After
Bach	PERSON	's death , the world gave him small attention ; his manuscripts were divided among his sons , and posterity was in danger of losing them .

		Fortunately , the younger son ,
Philipp Emanual	PERSON	, took care of his portion , -- the elder son ,
Friedmann	PERSON	, being dissipated and disposing of the precious works at his need and caprice , thus causing an irreparable loss .

		For a time
Bach	PERSON	was in an eclipse ; but he was sure to come into his own .

		The resuscitation owes much to the enthusiasm of
Mendelssohn	ORGANIZATION	and
Schumann	PERSON	, Franz and
Wagner	PERSON	; to-day and for all time he stands among the dii majores in the realm of art .

		The work of Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	occupies a place in the field of English musical literature quite its own ; we have few works to compare with it ; the voluminous life by
Spitta	PERSON	has , indeed , been translated , but its encyclopaedic character puts it into the domain of the special student .

		The present life of Bach is both for the student and the general reader .

		It is illu - minating in its discussion of
Bach	LOCATION	's music ; it presents all aspects of the master 's career fully and with insight ; it is sympathetic and highly appreciative .

		The large learning of the author has been put under contribution ; the great sub - ject has been treated in the style and with the reverence which it demands .

		It is an admirable book .

		The publishers have recognized their obligation and sent forth a fine volume with appropriate illustrations .


Louis James Block	ORGANIZATION	.

		Jo ax of Arc : Ax Anti-Clerical , View .

		* After nearly five centuries ,
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	has been formally enrolled among the beatified .

		In the minds of many devout Frenchmen she has long held the place of a saint ; but not till recently were her partisans able to produce argu - ments of a sufficiently convincing character to secure favorable action at
Rome	LOCATION	.

		But not all Frenchmen , it appears , regard the act of beatifi - cation in a serious light ; while good churchmen were seeking arguments to prove that the shep - herdess of Domremi was a worker of miracles , a famous literary artist was also examining the historical documents of the fifteenth century , and was gradually developing the theory that the strange and mysterious behavior of the Maid was merely the result of a morbid '' hallucinated '' mind acting on the fraudulent suggestions of selfish priests .


M. Anatole France	PERSON	published his biography in
1908	DATE	.

		It encountered an immediate and almost violent opposition .

		That the clerical elements should be hostile , is not strange ; more significant is the attitude of the professional his - torians , many of whom refused to regard the work as anything more than an anti-clerical brief .

		In the preface to the present -LRB- English -RRB- edition , the author admits that the reviewers had '' dis - covered in this work certain errors '' ; but these he tells us have been eliminated .

		And he adds : '' The hagiographers alone are openly hostile .

		They reproach me , not with my manner of explaining the facts , but with having explained them at all ... And these zealous inquisitors , so intent on condemning my work , have failed to discover therein any grave fault , any fla - grant inexactness .

		Their severity has had to content itself with a few inadvertences and with a few printer 's errors . ''

		It is interesting to find that among the '' hagio - graphers '' we shall have to class such writers as the late
M. Achille Luchaire	PERSON	, who knew medi - aeval
France	LOCATION	as few scholars have known it ; and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, who refused to accept
M. France	ORGANIZATION	's biography as definitive , and promptly proceeded to write another in refutation -LRB- see The Dial ,
April 16 , 1909	DATE	-RRB- ; and Mr.
F. C. Lowell	PERSON	, who once wrote an excellent biography of the Maid , and who characterizes the work of the great romancer as `` dangerously untrustworthy . ''

		M.
France	LOCATION	's conception of his subject is totally different from the conventional one .

		He sees her as the rather commonplace shepherdess , subject to mental aberrations in the form of * The

		198 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, hallucinations .

		She is good and saintly , -- the author repeatedly emphasizes her saintliness , but his conception of a mediaeval saint is such that the term is scarcely a compliment .

		Jeanne 's peculiar mental state he believes to have inter - ested the local clergy ; and soon , after a little careful coaching , the `` hallucinated lass '' is transformed into a prophetess . ''

		Had this idea of a holy militant mission , conceived by
Jeanne	PERSON	through the intermediary of her voices , come into her mind spontaneously without the intervention of any outside will , or had it been suggested to her by someone who was influencing her ? ''

		In answer to this fun - damental question , the author states that
Jeanne	PERSON	was acquainted with a prophecy that
France	LOCATION	'' would be ruined by a woman and saved by a maiden '' ; she had also been told that the '' Maiden Redeniptress should come from the border of Lorraine . ''

		And without further argument or evidence , the author concludes : `` It is no longer possible to doubt that the prophecy thus revised is the work of an eccle - siastic whose intentions may be easily divined . ''

		After this remarkable feat of logic , one is sur - prised to learn that the author can not name the priest in question ; but one among the suffering clergy of the Meuse valley '' whose name will never be known , raised up an angelic deliverer for the king and the kingdom of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		And now comes Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	with the positive statement that '' we have no evidence that she had heard of the Merlin prophecy till after she had announced her mission . ''

		In speaking of the
Dauphin	ORGANIZATION	's kingship , the Maid stated that he should hold
France	LOCATION	as a fief -LRB- en ^ commande -RRB- of the
King of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		This again is evidence to the author 's mind of clerical prompting .

		But critics reply to this that the idea could have been gotten from sermons ; it was the current idea of the time among church - men .

		At first
Jeanne	PERSON	announces a general mission , to save
France	LOCATION	; later , it is to deliver
Orleans	LOCATION	.

		And with fine sarcasm the historian comments in this fashion : '' We can not fail to recognize the readiness and the tact with which the Voices altered their commands previously given according to the necessities of the moment . ''

		The same priestly influence M.
France	LOCATION	finds at work during those six long weeks at
Poitiers	LOCATION	, when the theologians were examining the Maid to make sure that she was not sent by the evil one .

		`` But
Jeanne	PERSON	before the doctors at
Poitiers	LOCATION	was an exception ; she ran no risk of being suspected in mat - ters of faith .

		Even Brother
Pierre Turelure	PERSON	himself had no desire to find in her one of those heretics he zeal - ously sought to discover at
Toulouse	LOCATION	.

		In her presence the illustrious masters drew in their theological claws .

		They were churchmen , but they were Armagnacs , for the most part business men , diplomatists , old councillors of the
Dauphin	LOCATION	.

		As priests doubtless they were pos - sessed of a certain body of dogma and morality , and of a code of rules for judging matters of faith .

		But now it was a question not of curing the disease of heresy , but of driving out the English . ''

		However , the farce served a purpose : it gave time for the Maid 's fame to spread throughout the realm ; it familiarized the people of
France	LOCATION	with the thought that a miracle was to be per - formed on behalf of the miserable
Dauphin	LOCATION	; it filled his partisans with hope , his enemies with fear .

		Of the Maid 's actual achievements ,
M. France	LOCATION	does not speak with much enthusiasm .

		He holds that the situation of the besiegers of
Orleans	LOCATION	was , if possible , worse than that of the besieged .

		All that was necessary to dislodge the English was a little confidence ; and the Maid 's reputed sanctity furnished that .

		The author criticizes her determination to go to
Rheims	LOCATION	rather than against
Paris	LOCATION	; but '' she did not know enough of the configuration of the country to decide such a question , and it is not likely that her saints and angels knew more of geography than she did . ''

		At the same time , the author denies that the Maid had any influence on the determination to go to
Rheims	LOCATION	.

		It was the Archbishop of
Rheims	LOCATION	, a '' greedy , avaricious , unscrupulous '' churchman , who insisted on the journey , and who carried the day .

		`` Fifteen years had passed since his elevation to the archiepiscopal see of
Rheims	LOCATION	; and of his enormous revenue he had not yet received one penny . ''

		Here we have the motive .

		So far as foot-notes show , this remarkable conclusion is based on no docu - mentary evidence , and is reached in the face of Dunois 's testimony that '' the Maid won all to her determined course . ''

		Of the great tragedy that followed the capture of the Maid , -- the sale of the prisoner to the English , the two trials , and the execution , the author gives a circumstantial account of nearly two hundred pages .

		For the inactivity of
King Charles	PERSON	and the ecclesiastics of his party he can give no reason , unless it be that doubts had arisen among the Armagnacs as to the sanctity of the Maid .

		Two chapters , deal - ing with various pretended
Jeannes	PERSON	and the trial of rehabilitation -LRB- 1455 -RRB- , bring the narrative to a close .

		Four brief appendices are added , of which only one -- a letter from Dr.
G. Dumas	PERSON	1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAIj 199 cautiously accepting the author 's theory of hal - lucination and suggestion -- is of any particular interest .

		Reviewers have charged M.
France	LOCATION	with almost every offense known to historical writ - ing : suppressing or misinterpreting evidence , substituting plausible theory for documentary statements , misquoting important testimony , and the rest .

		Those charges will have to be left , however , to scholars who have an intimate acquaintance with the field in question .

		But on one point even the lay reader may have a right to form an opinion .

		In all historical writing , the attitude that the author assumes toward his subject is of prime importance ; and in this par - ticular case the attitude and the view-point are readily determined .

		In his Introduction ,
M. France	ORGANIZATION	tells us that he has tried to look at events from the view-point of the century in which
Jeanne	PERSON	lived ; and the earlier chapters give the impression that in this he has succeeded .

		But the reader soon discovers that his praise is insincere , that his purpose in describing pecul - iarities of fifteenth-century thought is not to instruct but to satirize , that of sympathy for his theme he has very little , and that he utterly fails to appreciate the importance of
Jeanne	PERSON	's achieve - ments for the history of his country .

		In many respects the biography is a remark - able work .

		Of literary excellences it is need - less to speak ; it is written in the same elegant style that we know from the author 's romances , though perhaps less vigorous , more controlled , and consequently more artificial .

		The general reader , as well as the student of history and of psychology , will find the volumes entertaining , suggestive , and thought-provoking .

		But it is not likely that the world will ever accept the picture of the young shepherdess that M.
France	LOCATION	has painted so skilfully as a faithful portrait of
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	.


Laurence M. Larson	PERSON	.

		Recent Poetry .

		* A timely word on the obsoleteness of war has been written by Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	, an Englishman , in a book that he well names ''
Europe	LOCATION	's Optical Elusion . ''

		In these days of '' Dreadnaughts '' and much talk about possible hostile invasions it is refreshing to chance upon a sensible and convincing presentation of the whole matter .

		So intricately interdependent , financially and industrially , are the nations of the world to-day that Mr.
Angell	PERSON	pronounces war to be '' intellectually obsolete . ''

		That it is also morally unthinkable , and in every way a most clumsy and unsatisfactory way to adjust international differences , no enlightened person can dispute .

		Warfare , whatever it was in Homer 's time , is now a thing without glamour or poetic charm , and we are nearly all heartily ashamed of it as a glar - ing anachronism , an ungainly survival of a ruder age .

		An allegory of sacred and profane love is found in '' A Vision of Life , '' by Mr.
Darrell Figgis	PERSON	.

		The narrator suffers the temptation of
St. Anthony	LOCATION	, but is saved by '' a voice of awful import '' that arouses his higher self .

		Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	is a metaphysical poet , as we may see from this example of his shorter pieces : '' Each hath the Type of bliss within his thought That utters for him all his Life would be : The summit of his soul 's felicity , The consummation wherein should be wrought In deft attainment all his spirit bought Awhile in fervent hope -- whose roundest fee T was good to pay . '

		T is so ; enough !

		For me , Be it amiss or be it fitly sought , This would I crave -- that mine and thy full soul
May	DATE	touch their mutual deep content , howe'er Life twists its tortuous course ; may still control Their Individuality , yet fare So subtly each on each , that as one whole They might stretch to their goal in God 's pure air . ''

		This volume is favored by an introduction from the pen of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, who finds in the poet a reversion to the Elizabethan manner , and holds him a spiritual kinsman of the late
Francis Thompson	PERSON	.

		He has `` the same essential qualities of sustained and systematic metrical style , of line linked with line in a process requiring the reader 's attention , and remote in its very nature from the startling simplicity of the old romantic ballad . ''

		All this may be allowed , and , indeed , appears clearly enough in our brief quotation .

		The critic goes on to say that '' if this kind of poetry prevails , people will have to listen to it rather as they listen to good and rather difficult music , not as they listen to scattered bril - liancies in a speech by Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	. ''

		Mr
Figgis	PERSON	is , moreover , '' on the side of the angels , '' and his work offers evidence of '' a certain return to right feeling and faith in life , not as an early dream of transcendentalism , but as an ultimate result of experience . ''

Moreton Frewen	PERSON	may be fairly illustrated by the lyric , '' Love Grown Cold . '' ''

		Like a voice from the tomb that is dead , Like the light of a star that is old , Like a face in a dream that has long since fled Is love grown cold ; `` The thoughts which I dared not think , The deeds that are past and done , Returning flock by memory 's brink One by one . ''

		Of the days that I loved you most , Of the days that you loved me best , Like the postern light of a ship at night We are dispossessed . ''

		A few of these pieces have African themes , and gain a touch of color thereby .

		Others are religious musings , and there is one rather pretty group of songs about birds .

		Mr.
Christopher Stone	PERSON	publishes a little book called '' Lusu8 , '' which is a collection of brief and pointless prose sketches with verses intermingled .

		The verses are usually commonplace , but something a little more than that is offered by the lines entitled '' The Idealist . '' ''

		Somewhere beyond the ocean 's melting rim , Beyond the level surface of the waves , He dreams of islands , in whose echoing caves Rest and eternal music wait for him .

		Behind , long billows seem to touch the brim Of low white cliffs , and looking back he craves To stand once more at his forefathers ' graves , Hard by the cottage-door and garden trim .

		Too late he turns the prow ; through fretful spray The keel slips homeward , and the ominous roar Of tumbling surf is nearer , till once more Within the arms of his familiar bay He hears the village bell from far away , And lo !

		The '' Odds and Ends '' of Mr.
R. Moutagu Tabor	PERSON	are parodies , exercises in classical and macaronic verse , political and social skits , and vers de societS of the sort made familiar by numerous exemplars . ''

		A Dissolution of Partnership '' is a neat and effec - tive example . ''

		When you played at Bridge with me , When I saw you lightly make , As my smiling vis-a-vis , Every possible mistake , I forgave you , though I paid Dearly for the slips you made . ''

		When you played at Golf with me , When your efforts made the ball Through the green or from the tee Into every bunker fall , I forgave you , though it cost Many a pang each time we lost . ''

		When you played at Love with me , Ah !

		what science then , what skill Drew me to your feet to be Now discarded at your will ; Shall I still forgive you ?

		Yes !

		Nothing ever grieved me less . ''

		Mr.
Tabor	PERSON	's touch as a parodist may be shown by a couple of brief examples . ''

		The
Trippers	ORGANIZATION	came down to the sea in their hordes , And their raiment was gorgeous with gewgaws and gauds , And their brass was as brazen , their manners as free , As when they lark nightly through
Shoreditch	LOCATION	, E. C. '' '' What means this flimsy paper blue , With hints of all the ills I '11 rue Be my return not full and true ?

		The Census . ''

		What strikes me with profound dismay At what my maiden aunt will say When pressed to state her natal day ?

		The Census . ''

		A few more extracts would go far to prove that the author was in line to qualify for the laurels of
C. S. C	ORGANIZATION	.

		In '' The Rough Rider , and Other Poems , '' Mr.
Bliss Carman	PERSON	's lyre is attuned to themes suggested by his adopted country .

		New England legends , Puritan ballads , tributes to our national heroes , and songs in commemoration of our national festivals , make up this pleasing little volume , and show the writer to have fairly earned citizenship with us .

		We are not quite sure that his description of '' The Rough Rider '' fits , but we can not deny its writer 's conviction . ''

		Who is the hardy figure Of virile fighting strain , With valor and conviction In heart , and hand , and brain ?

		Sprung from our old ideals To serve our later needs , He is the modern Roundhead , The man who rides and reads . ''

		But we can accord him complete sympathy when he hymns '' A New England Thanksgiving '' in such strains as the following : '' Here lived the men who gave us The purpose that holds fast , The dream that nerves endeavor , The glory that shall last .

		Here strong as pines in
winter	DATE	, And free as ripening corn , Our faith in fair ideals -- Our fathers ' faith -- was born .

		M Here shone through simple living , With pride in word and deed , And consciences of granite , The old
New England	LOCATION	breed .

		With souls assayed by hardship , Illumined , self-possessed , Strongly they lived , and left us Their passion for the best . ''

		The note of social idealism is predominant in this new collection of verse , but the author still hears the call of the open road , and has lost nothing of his sensitive response to the ministries of nature .

		Last
summer	DATE	's celebration at
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	seems to have fared well at the hands of the poets .

		In our last article we quoted from Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's ode .

		Mr.
Carman	PERSON	has a song upon this theme in the volume just discussed , and Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	's '' Ticonderoga '' is given the precedence among his '' Poems , '' recently published .

		It is a spirited composition , ending with these lines .

		`` So by my visionary shore Soldier and saint and sagamore Live in my shadow evermore : Where , rapt in beauty , slopes
Champlain	LOCATION	, Lulled are the passion and the pain ; The vision and the race remain . ''

		THE DIAL 201 A group of other pieces written for occasions fol - lows , and their themes take a range wide enough to include
Tennyson	PERSON	, the exploits of Mr.
Wilbur Wright	PERSON	, the
American University	ORGANIZATION	, the New Theatre of
New York	LOCATION	, and the death of Verestschagin .

		Then come the '' Poems Lyrical and Descriptive '' that fill the second half of the volume .

		We may allow the word '' descriptive , '' but hardly the word • • lyrical . ''

		The work is too jerky and prosaic to be called song .

		The following lines concerning Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's dramatic success , offer a striking example of how not to write poetry . ''

		Henceforth - we can not be the same ; for us Americans , because of you , the tide Dramatic turns to seek its heritage Splendidly homeward to ourselves ; our stage Is cleft , between its pusillanimous And daring goals stands now the
Great Divide	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		By way of contrast , and for the purpose of holding the scales even , we now give one of Mr.
Mackaye	PERSON	's best poems , the sonnet to
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's memory . ''

		Out of the ' obscure wood ' and ominous way Which are our life , to that obscurer sea Whose margin glooms and gleams alternately With storm and splendor of the shrouded spray -- He has departed .

		Our familiar day .

		His elm-hushed , ivied walks no more shall see That radiant smile of austere courtesy : On Shady Hill the mist hangs cold and gray . ''

		He has departed hence , but not alone : Still in his steps , where golden discourse burns , To
Virgil	PERSON	now he speaks , and now he turns
Toward Alighieri	ORGANIZATION	in calm undertone , Holding with modest tact his path between The
Mantuan	PERSON	and the mighty Florentine . ''

		Mr.
John Myers O'Hara	PERSON	, who published some time ago a paraphrased version of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, now gives us H Songs of the Open , '' a lyrical volume of his own .

		He has the true sense of the wild , and can be vividly picturesque upon occasion , as in '' Night in the Woods . '' ''

		The trees brood rigid and stark ,
Grey	PERSON	wolves in the brushwood bark ; A blast from the clearing sprays The snow in powdery haze . ''

		The resinous pine boughs crack ; A wild-cat doubles its track , Slinks cowed from the campfire 's flare O'er crusted slopes to its lair . '

		* The reach of the timber line Auroral flashes define ; And edged with a dagger light The pole-star pierces the night . ''

		Here is surely not a word to spare , and the scene is sharply etched .

		Nor is the reflective note lacking , for we find it in this `` Silhouette '' and in several other pieces . ''

		Limned dark against the sinking disk of red .

		One lonely tree Lifts its lorn boughs in bare obliquity ; `` Sad eremite whose arms despairing spread And agonize In dumb appeal to the responseless skies ; • • Old twisted fingers of fair seasons fled , Pointing in air Worn palms that plead in long unanswered prayer . ''

		Mr.
O'Hara	PERSON	's measures are frequently too rugged to be purely lyrical , and he has a taste for forced adjectives that is a trifle jarring .

		One of his best lines ' is spoiled by the word '' seismic , '' which he evidently thinks should have three syllables .

		Mr.
Robert Loveman	PERSON	's slender volume of lyrics is styled `` The Blushful South and Hippocrene . ''

		There are three score and ten of them , save one , and all are simple and sincere .

		Our choice shall be the two stanzas called '' Love . '' ''

		We lack love ; if we have love We have all in all ,
Earth	LOCATION	below and stars above , And calm and carnival . '

		• Love makes the ringed world ours , We are peers of God , Love woos and makes the flowers , Dew-drowsing ` neath the sod . ''

		Now and then these songs are freighted with the burden of the world 's woe , but most of them are such airy and charming trifles as the one we have quoted .

		Art and nature , heroism and virtue , the delicate motions of the spirit touched by suggestions of the past , and the aspirations of the soul rapt by mystical intuitions -- these are the chief notes of Miss
Louise Imogen Guiney	PERSON	's song , now for nearly a quarter of a century escaping her to reach the public ear .

		She is one of the subtlest and most artistic of our lyrists , and many will be glad of the volume which she calls `` Happy Ending '' -LRB- may it be anything but an ending ! -RRB-

		into which she has brought `` the less faulty half '' of her previously published verse .

		Although the poems are not new , they shall here be illustrated by one brief example -- this '' Deo Optimo Maximo '' which reveals the singer 's deepest self . ''

		All else for use .

		One only for desire ; Thanksgiving for the good , but thirst for Thee : Up from the best , whereof no man need tire , Impel Thou me . ''

		Delight is menace if Thou brood not by , Power a quicksand , Fame a gathering jeer .

		Oft as the morn -LRB- though none of earth denv These three are dear -RRB- , '' Wash me of them , that I may be renewed , And wander free amid my freeborn joys : Oh , close my hand upon Beatitude !

		Not on her toys . ''

		A rich freightage of both thought and emotion is borne with each new argosy launched by Miss
Edith M. Thomas	PERSON	.

		The fleet has grown steadily in num - bers for thirty or more years , and its collected cargo is a possession that we would not willingly miss from our literature . ''

		The Guest at the Gate '' is the latest volume to bear the name of
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	, and from its varied contents -- dramatic , gnomic , and lyric -- we select this tender invocation to `` Domiduca , '' the goddess who watches over the wanderer 's homeward journeyings .

		Lead home , brooder of the brooding bird , With wings bedewed , in grassy covert deep , Sleep-lulled , with its half - uttered vesper-notes ; Lead home , guardian of the couching flock , By pools wherein the shadow lies unstirred ; Lead home the toilers all , who scarce can keep Their pathway for encumbering drowsiness ; Lead home , pilot of lonely skiffs that rock On yearning seas where bright the moon-path floats ; Lead all these home , and of thy bounty bless -- Lead home !

		Mrs.
Helen Huntington	PERSON	's volume of simple lyrics , '' From the Cup of Silence , and Other Poems , '' may - be illustrated by quoting these stanzas '' To Snow . '' ''

		Strange divinity of snow , Eager other worlds to know , Spotless spirit , not of earth , What wild power invoked thy birth ? ''

		All the stars to thee have told Raptures of eternal cold , All the silent , ice-bound streams Made thee keeper of their dreams . ''

		They are pretty verses , if not deeply inspired .

		Something like this may also be said of the '' Lyrics of Life , '' by Mrs.
Florence Earle Coates	PERSON	.

		The idealism of this writer is fine and true , and she has an eye for themes that invite poetical treatment .

		Her best work is represented by such a poem as '' The Christ of the Andes . '' ''

		Far , far the mountain peak from me Where lone he stands , with look caressing ; Yet from the valley , wistfully I lift my dreaming eyes , and see His hand stretched forth in blessing .

		Never bird sings nor blossom blows Upon that summit chill and breathless , Where throned he waits amid the snows ; But from his presence wide outflows Love that is warm and deathless . ''

		Briefs o ^ r New Books .

		Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	, in an apprecia - a ` ZE&SL .

		tive es8a y on '' .

		Whistler 's Writing , '' offers an ingeniously impersonal plea for himself -- for the artist who uses two mediums of expression but can not get himself taken seriously in both of them .

		Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	does not commit the unforgivable sin -- in an essayist -- of taking himself too seriously .

		He is entertained by himself , after the manner of his friend , Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	; he exploits his own foibles , at times with almost Chestertonian ceremoniousness ; but he is essentially of neither
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	's nor
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's cult .

		As a caricaturist he is truly humorous ; as an essayist he knows how to trifle with life as genially as did Lamb and
Stevenson	PERSON	, and far more compellingly than does his contem - porary , Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	.

		The occasion of these remarks is the appearance of an American edition of `` Yet Again '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , the fourth volume of Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	's collected essays .

		Open fires , train - time goodbyes , the invisible President of the
Swiss Republic	ORGANIZATION	, a sensible substitute for '' rest-cures , '' the horrors of leader-writing , the tragic spoliation of a beautifully labelled hat-box , British humor , street - names , and the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	manner , are some of the subjects on which Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	, gravely , daintily , and wittily , frees his mind .

		Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	is a bystander , an observer , endowed with the keenest possible sense of the art of life , but ami - ably detached from all its practical issues .

		He poses a little ; he deliberately cultivates interesting prejudices and significant predispositions .

		And whatever he chooses to talk about , in a style inti - mate , elaborate , quite sincere beneath its polish , takes on a new meaning -- and keeps it .

		We shall never , we are sure , listen to a verger in
Westmin	ORGANIZATION	- ster
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	without remembering Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	's vivid account of the poor man 's slavery to sameness , and his apt suggestion that parrots , comfortably perched on each bust and statue , might easily be taught to relieve `` these sad-faced men of their intolerable mission . ''

		When we see a friend off for a journey we shall recall the professional '' seer-off '' of the
Anglo-American Social Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, and the read - ing of the editorials in the morning paper will be enlivened by the recollection of the '' pathetic im - posture '' involved , according to Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	, in the effort to comment effectively , to order , at top speed , on the news of the day .

		Some early
Schopenhauer	PERSON	's assertion that the appreciations number of years that elapse between of Meredith .

		^ ne appearance of a book and its acknowledgment gives the measure of time that the author is in advance of his age , has given rise to much discussion apropos of the writings of Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Was Mr.
James Thomson	PERSON	cor - rect in asserting that
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's article on `` The Egoist '' -LRB- published in `` The Athenaeum , ''
1879	DATE	-RRB- was the first public utterance on Meredith '' evincing the critic 's familiarity with all the writer 's works '' ?

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 According to Mr.
Maurice Buxton Forman	PERSON	, Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	was mistaken ; and , in order to give the student of Meredith an insight into the contemporary criticism of that author , he has chosen twenty-three articles representing critical judgment on Meredith from the
year 1851	DATE	, when his first book was pub - lished , till 1 883 , when he issued his M Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of
Earth	LOCATION	. ''

		These articles ap - peared originally in English reviews -- some anony - mously , and others over such signatures as
William Michael Rossetti	PERSON	,
Kingsley	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Richard Garnet	PERSON	,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Mark Pattison	PERSON	, ``
William Ernest Henley	PERSON	, and
James Thomson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	was perhaps , on the whole .

		Meredith 's stanchest champion , admiring more unreservedly than the rest , and calling less attention to his '' objectionable subtlety of style '' and his u faults of construction . ''

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's famous and poignant reply to '' The Spectator 's '' review of '' Modern Love '' came out boldly with the announcement that '' a more perfect piece of writing no man alive has ever turned out than the sonnet beginning `` We saw the swallows gathering in the sky . ''

		George Eliot unhesitatingly pronounced `` The Shaving of Shagpat '' a work of genius .

		Mr.
Henley	PERSON	com - pared Meredith to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in that he was '' a man of genius who was a clever man as well . ''

		Meredith 's writings were obviously not sensed by the many of his time , not even by the critics gener - ally ; but the foregoing examples show that he was appreciated by the few somewhat earlier than has been generally supposed .

		In Mr.
Forman	PERSON	's col - lection of these u Early Appreciations of Meredith '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , there is much good reading for those who are curious about that great author .

		In many of them there is a combination of perceptiveness and lack of discrimination curious in itself .

		One might dispute even with Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	-LRB- who says so many fine things -RRB- that Meredith is distinctly a man 's writer .

		And why is there no mention of the Essay on Comedy ?

		It appeared in
1877	DATE	, but , up to
1883	DATE	had apparently provoked no comment worthy of repetition .

		It is interesting also to note that , although contemporary criticism of Meredith 's novels and poems was in many respects radically different from that of to-day , the quotations from his writings in both cases are much the same .

		It would seem as if certain beautiful and pertinent passages had aroused from the beginning the intel - ligent reader 's admiration .

		Professor
J. Laurence Laughlin	PERSON	's volume on '' Latter-day Problems '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a presentation of cer - tain social and economic questions in untechnical language , and is designed for popular reading .

		The material originally appeared , largely , in various magazines , and was then published by way of com - ment upon issues that are figuring in the political contests of the present day .

		The essays cover a wide range , including some primarily social or sociological matters , such as u Socialism , a
Philoso	LOCATION	- Yital problem * , economic and tociological .

		phy of Failure , '' `` The Abolition of Poverty , '' '' Social Settlements , '' and the like ; and also some strictly economic topics , such as '' Guaranty of Bank Deposits , '' '' Government vs. Bank Issues , '' and others of kindred character .

		Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	's essays have the great merit of bringing to the solu - tion of current problems the results of analyses made by a clear and practical mind .

		They are conspicu - ously meritorious in that they nowhere fall into the common errors of sentimentalism or Utopian dream - ing .

		They have the additional and unusual virtue of conviction and of clearness in exposition .

		No one need be in doubt , after reading these chapters , either about the author 's conclusions or the line of reasoning by which they have been arrived at .

		Professor
Laughlin	PERSON	can never be charged with fall - ing between two stools .

		He is , throughout , con - sistent and determined in his adherence to a definite economic philosophy .

		A criticism which , however , will certainly be brought against bis discussion of those topics that have a larger social bearing is the apparent lack of sympathy , or allowance for differ - ences in points of view , in training , and in capacity .

		Many will perhaps feel that he has too positive a belief in the stability and permanence of the present economic order , or one closely similar to it ; and that he lays too little stress upon the possibility of improvement as the result of combined social , rather than of individual , effort .

		K these criticisms are brought against this volume of essays , however , they must stand as an impeachment , not so much of the author 's work , as of the school of thought to which he belongs .

		It is likely that the essays which will be most valued are those dealing with Banking and Currency questions , where the author speaks as our foremost academic specialist in such matters .

		The ideas he puts forward may well serve as an antidote to some of the dangerous schemes that have lately received sanction in high quarters .

		Actually to wander about the won - derful country lying around
Rome	LOCATION	is one of the most delightful of pos - sible experiences : to make the same trips through the pages of a book with
Signor Rodolfo Lanciani	PERSON	as a guide is a pleasure scarcely less .

		In '' Wander - ings in the Roman Campagna '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Signor Lanciani	PERSON	, as in his previous books , shows himself a master of the art of arranging material which in other hands might be dull , so that , for the time being , we all become archaeologists and share his enthusiasm in all his '' finds . ''

		The most charac - teristic features of the
Campagna	PERSON	landscape , as we see it to-day , are the remains of aqueducts and reservoirs stretching over the crumpled plains and ruins of tombs lining the roadsides .

		In this book we are taken back to the happy days when the
Campagna	PERSON	resembled a great park , studded with villages , farms , cottages , lordly residences , temples , fountains , and tombs ; when these tombs contained not only a funeral banquet ing-hall level with the road , but also a crypt below , where the ashes were Wandering * about
Rome	LOCATION	, old and new .

		How these changes came about , and how new discoveries underground are still being made , is an interesting story .

		Indeed , the last three years seem to have been notably marked by eventful revel - ations , -- for example , the beautiful bas-relief of Antinous at
Torre del Padiglione	ORGANIZATION	, with the name of its sculptor carved upon it -LRB-
October , 1907	DATE	-RRB- ; the sarcophagus , a masterpiece of
Hadrian	PERSON	's golden age , found by the workmen digging ground for the new freight station at
Rome	LOCATION	-LRB-
June , 1908	DATE	-RRB- ; the interest - ing triangular altar on the
Janiculum	LOCATION	, only a year ago .

		Most important of all , perhaps , are the things brought to light near the
King	PERSON	's hunting-box at
Castel Porziano	ORGANIZATION	: a Roman cottage on the coast of
Laurentum	LOCATION	, and a copy of
Myron	PERSON	's statue of the Disk-thrower -- '' Queen
Elena	PERSON	's Cottage '' and '' Queen
Elena	PERSON	's Discobolus , '' as they will hereafter be known .

		Three out of the six chapters of the present book have headings of tempting literary sound -- '' The Land of
Horace	PERSON	. '' ''

		The Land of
Cicero	LOCATION	, '' '' The Land of Pliny the Younger . ''

		These regions , so lovely in themselves , are somewhat lack - ing in absolute landmarks of the homes and lives of the great writers .

		But even if no exact bounda - ries can be traced of the Sabine farm , it is certain that we can recognize the streams and hills and fields that
Horace	PERSON	loved so well ; that we can wan - der along the same Via
Valeria	PERSON	which the poet loved to pace in the early morning hours , on his way to the villa of Maecenas . ''

		As a bee darts from the fields of Matinum where the redolent thyme grows , so I follow the banks of the Anio to feel the inspira - tion of the Muses . ''

		The volume is published in the same sumptuous style of its five predecessors on Roman themes .

		There are maps and illustrations abundant in quantity and charming in quality ; many are of full-page , and many entirely new .

		It is to be hoped that the author will keep his half - promise for a second volume of these charming '' Wanderings . ''

		''„ „ ; , .

		, „„ * When a book is written by a distin - Sack-yard J studies of guished r renchman , translated by a the stars .

		competent Englishman , and mar - keted in this country by an American publishing - house , one naturally expects to find some merit in it .

		Such a book is Rudeaux 's '' How to Study the Stars '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		To be sure , the author 's name is spelt in one way on the cover , and in another on the title-page ; and the translator on rare occasions seems to miss the author 's meaning , as in the sen - tence , '' But these remarks have mainly a theoretical value , since their effect is usually realized in that portion of the plate which is rendered useless by the least instrumental distinctness '' -LRB- pp. 325-6 -RRB- .

		However , a very few blemishes of this sort are simply the flies in the ointment ; the ointment itself is very attractive .

		It is not too much to say that this is the best book in the English language in its particular field .

		Its aim is to teach and direct those who wish to make observations of celestial objects with small telescopes and home-made appliances , as well as to indulge in celestial photography .

		The author has evidently had abundant experience of this soi ` t , and gives his directions with commendable explicitness and charming na'ivetS .

		In the first third of the book he gives descriptions of methods by which as amateur , having purchased his lenses , may make his own telescope or celestial camera , if he be so minded ; he also provides for the needs of one who purchases a ready-made small telescope , and wishes to gain a thorough insight into its con - struction .

		Besides this , good advice is given about the construction of an inexpensive observatory .

		The remainder of the book is devoted to minute and care - ful instructions about how to make observations or photographs of the different sorts of objects which one finds in the sky .

		Here the author 's experience in such work stands out very plainly , and enables him to give directions at once detailed , sound , and helpful .

		There are seventy-nine illustrations , many of which are from the author 's own observations and photo - graphs ; they well demonstrate the excellent results which follow the skilful manipulation of small in - struments .

		While very few persons in this country have telescopes in their back-yards , as Professor
Hale	PERSON	and Mr.
Burnham	PERSON	have had with such happy results , those who are so equipped will find their interest heightened and their work rendered more effective by reading
M. Rudeaux	PERSON	's work .


London Town	LOCATION	, B y ron has written of
London	LOCATION	as `` a from
King Lud	ORGANIZATION	new land which foreigners can never to Queen '' Vic '' understand . ''

		As an aid , however , to its fuller comprehension we may recommend Mr.
Arthur Compton-Rickett	PERSON	's well-conceived and carefully-executed work , '' The
London	LOCATION	Life of Yesterday '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In thirteen erudite but not unreadable chapters are presented the general aspect and bearing of the city at various periods , from the time of
King Lud	ORGANIZATION	to the reign of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		First we have ''
London	LOCATION	in the Making , '' then the
London	LOCATION	of
Alfred	PERSON	's day , after that , successively , the
London	LOCATION	of the twelfth century , of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's time , under
Whittington	PERSON	's magistracy , in the Renaissance , during the Reformation , as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	saw it , as
Milton	LOCATION	and

Christopher Wren	PERSON	rebuilt it , -- the
London	LOCATION	of
Addison	PERSON	and Pope , of Johnson and
Hogarth	PERSON	, and , finally , of Francis Place and
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		An appended bibliography of seven pages gives the contemporary and more recent sources of information drawn upon by the author , who has done well to dwell less on the physical features of the great city than on its manners and customs , its interests and aims , and its progress toward a higher civilization .

		As for the boys , some of them were mercilessly gorged with learning at a very tender age .

		Locke speaks of one who began Latin at six , understood '' geography and chronology and the Copernican system of our vortex '' at nine , and had some acquaintance with anatomy .

G. P. Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's Sons -RRB- that nearly sixty years ago brought out • ' The Wide Wide World . ''

		It is as the author of this , her first novel , published in
1850	DATE	, that
Susan Warner	PERSON	is chiefly remembered .

		The book , a relig - ious romance , was very widely read in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, as well as at home ; and many of us can remember with what absorption we followed the fortunes of poor little
Ellen Montgomery	PERSON	.

		Nowa - days the religious emotion of the story seems exag - gerated , almost morbid ; but it was , after all , an entirely natural expression of the fife of the author .


Susan Warner	PERSON	lived in a time when babies were born middle-aged , -- so perhaps it is not strange that at thirty-one she should have written a story whose heroine possessed an over-developed con - science .

		The wonder is that , in spite of this , her book was full of genuine human interest , and so escaped sentimentality .

		It seems an ungracious task to pick flaws in a work so evidently a labor of love as this biography .

		The author ,
Anna B. Warner	PERSON	, says in her preface : '' I have tried to put in nothing irrelevant , but with everything so inter - esting to me it was often hard to choose . ''

		This we can well believe ; and to a woman now past eighty , writing of an adored sister , we must pardon the gentle garrulity of age .

		The pages are full of de - tails , interesting only to one with a background of intimate personal knowledge and affection .

		The letters and extracts from journals are linked by comment sadly lacking in clearness and coherence .

		For the most part the letters are undated , and the sequence of events can only be guessed .

		Never - theless the book gives an interesting picture of life in and about
New York	LOCATION	in the forties and fifties ; also a genuine portrait of a gentlewoman , by nature eager , sensitive , and studious , who was always , in spite of Puritan influences , a devout worshipper of Beauty .

		Half the clever Frenchmen of this generation seem to be playwrights , and the other half historians : and this volume is a very creditable bit of work from the shop of an artisan of the latter - named guild .

		The most striking feature of the au - thor 's method is his fondness for '' portraits '' of the old classic variety ; and a remarkable evidence of his conscientiousness is his desperate effort to be just to the English .

		His first chapter has a lucid state - ment of the relationships subsisting between all the leading members of the Bourbon family at the time of the Restoration .

		There is a good index , and an extensive table of contents which is in itself a com - plete and detailed account of the events of the period .

		An appendix , in the form of an extract from the Almanach Royal of
1815	DATE	, gives the
King	ORGANIZATION	's house - hold in full -- Grand Almoner , Confessor , Chief Pantler , Chief Cupbearer , and the rest -- sixty-nine persons in all ; with the household of
Monsieur	PERSON	, the Comte d'Artois , who later became
Charles X.	PERSON	, the second list comprising thirty-one names .

		The translator deserves special mention .

		She has not only given us a well-written version of the French text , -- she has furnished in the footnotes correc - tions of errors and explanations of obscurities which prove her capable of writing , if she chose , quite as good a history of Louis XVIII .

		as the one she has translated .

		Though Major De Bouillane de ^ SS `` . ''

		I * ```` to , `` - .

		Aronnd Afghanistan '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a personal account of the author 's trip from
Teheran	LOCATION	to the Chinese frontier , thence through
Little Tibet	LOCATION	and Kashmere , and across the
Baluchistan	LOCATION	desert back to the beginning of the loop , it is nevertheless an important addition to our knowledge of the '' buffer state . ''

		Trained students of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	affairs are so confident that a telling conflict between
Russia	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	must arise for the superior hand over this land , that any book is welcome which adds its mite toward a true understanding of the confused and contradictory state of affairs now existing under the unsteady ruler of that country .

		Major de Lacoste travelled round
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, peeping , as it were , over the walls , but the direction and purpose of his peepings are heralded in a preface by
M. Georges Leygues	PERSON	, who , quite naturally , takes a pro-Franco-Russo view of affairs by insisting that Lord
Curzon	PERSON	and the high Indian officials made many sad mistakes during the Japanese-Russian war , and that every mistake stirred up not only the Indian - Afghan problem but also the whole Asiatic problem .

		Very naturally , too ,
M. Leygues	PERSON	is of the opinion that all the Western nations are forced to take a stand on the question , and then -- the world conflict .

		Of this serious matter there is only a slight echo in the body of this book ; rather , Major de Lacoste gives us an intelli - gent and entertaining account of the people , their manners and their country .

		The illustrations are unusual and instructive .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, L .

		, , .

		.

		The Rev.
John White	PERSON	said that a of Quantreii , large part of the first settlers of the guerrilla .


Massachusetts Bay	LOCATION	were `` rude , un - governable persons , the very scum of the land . ''

		Such is always the case in new settlements ; and it was es - pecially true of the western frontier at the time of the Civil War .

		The worst of the '' scum '' was Quantreii , whose life has recently been written by Mr.
William Elsey Connelley	PERSON	-LRB-
Torch Press	ORGANIZATION	, Cedar Rapids , la . -RRB-

		.

		Mr.
Connelley	PERSON	originally acquired a collection of Quantreii papers , made by the late
W. W. Scott	PERSON	, who was a newspaper editor at
Canal Dover	ORGANIZATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and an early friend of the
Quantreii	PERSON	family .

		These papers he has supplemented by indefatigable re - search , and by conversation with persons who knew Quantreii at every stage of his career .

		The result he has somewhat loosely put together in a large book , which gives the life-history of the notorious guerrilla in great detail .

		So many contradictory statements have been made about Quantreii that it is well the work should be done .

		The book throws a lurid light upon conditions in
Missouri	LOCATION	at the time , and adds a chapter to the psychology of the degenerate .

		It strips Quantreii of the glamour that has sometimes attached to his name , and shows how inevitably in real life the wages of sin is death .

		Notes .

		Mr.
Arthur Rackkam	PERSON	has selected
Wagner	PERSON	's '' Ring '' as the subject for his next illustrative work .

		The authorized English translation of
M. Edmond Rostand	PERSON	's new drama , '' Chanticleer , '' will be issued in this country by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A set of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's works , in thirty volumes , will be added this
spring	DATE	by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their attractive series of standard authors in complete editions .

		George Meredith 's last novel , `` Celt and
Saxon	PERSON	, '' now appearing serially in an English periodical , will be published during the coming summer by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Two new volumes will be added this
spring	DATE	to Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	's '' Leading Americans '' series .

		These are '' Lead - ing American Novelists '' by Mr.
John Erskine	PERSON	; and '' Leading American Essayists '' by Mr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		A Nature-book of an unusual sort is promised in Mrs.
Mabel Loomis Todd	PERSON	's '' A Cycle of Sunsets , '' soon to be issued by
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a sympathetic study of sunsets , interwoven with a pleasant little love-story .

		Mr.
O. C. Auringer	PERSON	, author of several volumes of verse , is about to issue a volume of twin tragedies of the Revolution , entitled '' The Death of Maid
McCrea	PERSON	, and the Lover 's Tragedy . ''

		Messrs.
Badger & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, are the publishers .

		Two volumes are devoted to '' The Great English Short-Story Writers '' in '' The Reader 's Library '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , edited by Messrs.
W. J.	PERSON	and
C. W. Dawson	PERSON	.

		Thirteen examples are given in each volume , half of the number being of American origin .

		The second volume is supposed to be more '' modern '' than the first , but there is not much chronological difference between
Stevenson	PERSON	, Mr.
James	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, on the one hand , and Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	, Sir .


Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	, on the other .

		A study of
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	, by
Gerard Harry	PERSON	, translated by Mr.
A. R. Allinson	PERSON	, including two essays by
Maeterlinck	PERSON	hitherto unpublished in English , is announced .

		The book will have a photogravure por - trait of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, and other illustrations .

		Recently at the
Abbey Theatre	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, a new play in ballad metre , by Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, `` The Green Helmet , '' was produced by the National Theatre Com - pany .

		The play is founded on a folk-tale of the
Cuchu	PERSON	- lain cycle , and Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's experiment in the use of ballad metre is completely successful .

		Three new volumes in the '' Library of Living Thought , '' published by the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	, are the following : '' Roman Law in
Mediaeval Europe	LOCATION	, '' by Prof.
Paul Vinogradoff	PERSON	; `` Crete the Foreruimer of
Greece	LOCATION	, '' by
C. H. Hawes	PERSON	and Miss
Harriet B. Hawes	PERSON	; and '' Diamonds , '' by Sir
William Crookes	PERSON	.

		It is announced that with the
April	DATE	issue '' Putnam 's Magazine '' will suspend publication , its subscription list having been transferred to the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . '' ''

		Putnam 's '' was conducted in a dignified manner , without resort to sensationalism in matter or methods ; and we regret to hear of its disappearance from the magazine field .

		The English `` Who 's Who '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- grows thicker and thicker .

		The volume for
1910	DATE	fills about twenty-two hundred pages , and contains several hun - dreds of new names , while of the old ones '' few die and none resign , '' to quote
Jefferson	PERSON	on office-holders .

		The selection of American names seems to be as capricious as ever .

		The prize of fifteen hundred dollars offered by the governors of the
Shakespeare Memorial Theatre	ORGANIZATION	in
Stratford-upon-Avon	LOCATION	for the best play has been won by Miss
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	with '' The
Piper	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Three hundred and fifteen plays were submitted in the competition .

		The successful work will be produced in the Memorial Theatre .

		Two interesting titles are announced for
spring	DATE	pub - lication in Messrs.
Houghton Mifflin Company 's River	LOCATION	- side Press Editions .

		One of these is a reprint of '' Pan 's Pipes , '' among the most charming of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	's essays ; the other is entitled '' A Poet in Exile , '' and consists of some early letters written by
John Hay	PERSON	to his friend Miss
Nora Perry	PERSON	, now issued under the editorship of Miss
Caroline Ticknor	PERSON	.

		The
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	announces that it will publish during the autumn of this year , '' The Records of the Federal Convention of
1787	DATE	, '' under the editor - ship of Prof.
Farrand	PERSON	, of the
Department of History	ORGANIZATION	at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Until now the printed records have been scattered through a dozen or more different works , and there has been some unpublished material of con - siderable value .

		Evident need has thus existed for this new and complete edition , which brings together , in a single work , all of these scattered records .

		It is expected that the exhaustive search made by Professor
Farrand	PERSON	will result in the present work 's proving to be a definitive edition of the '' Records of the Federal Con - vention of
1787	DATE	. ''

		The records will appear in three royal octavo volumes , with a special limited subscribers ' edition on English hand-made paper .

		BROWNE 'S BOOKSTORE THE FINE ARTS BUILDING CHICAGO QUALITY vs. QUANTITY A MONG other sensible remarks , a ^ * writer in `` The American Printer '' had this to say recently : • '' A short time ago I read the claims of a newspaper business manager who was talking big circulation .

		He claimed that a man out shooting ducks would stand a better chance of success by firing into a big flock than into a smaller flock .

		And so he would if they were all ducks .

		But if ninety per cent of the flock were mud-hens and gulls , and crows , and herons , he would do better if he let them pass and waited for the smaller flock .

		Circulation does n't mean much .

		It 's the canvas - backs in the flock that count , -- in other words , financial standing and probable interest of audience that the book publisher must consider .

		What 's the use in urging a dollar-and-a-half book on five hundred thousand readers if eighty per cent of that number did n't know there was that much money in the world , and would n't spend it for books if they had it to spare ? ''

		I N ADVERTISING in The Dial the publisher wastes no ammunition , -- every bird in the flock is a canvas - back .

		The Dial is devoted exclusively to books -- its readers are exclusively buyers of books .

		Several thousand well-to-do people -- private readers , librarians , booksellers -- read The Dial regularly , and depend wholly upon its guidance in making book purchases .

		` T'HESE people , the cream of the American book-buying public , can be reached only through The Dial .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 M fc M U h M H H h h 4 - OOOK publishers and book journals are * - * alike sustained by a book public The people who read book journals are the ones who buy books .

		All the readers of a book journal are bookish people .

		The Dial is preeminently a book journal , published solely in the interests of the book class , -- the literary and culti - vated cla ^ s.

		BRIEFER MENTION 248 NOTES 249 TOPICS LN APRIL PERIODICALS 250 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 250 THE BANKRUPTCY OF LITERATURE . ''

		What would happen , '' asks
M. Andre Beaunier	PERSON	in a recent review , `` if all the cus - tomers of all the bakers should set about baking bread themselves ? ''

		It is hardly necessary to reply that the bakers would go into bankruptcy .

		This quaint reflection comes from a dismayed observer of the plethora of modern books , more solicitous , perhaps , than he need be concerning the welfare of their writers .

		More fitly than in most cases , the plea of this class that they must live may be given the answer of the familiar anecdote .

		What is the necessity , indeed , for this continued activity in a world that groans beneath the burden of their literary production , a world upon which they wantonly bestow so questionable a gift ?

		The eminent critic who , a few years ago , in a petulant mood declared science to be bankrupt , might with greater justice have sought to establish a case for the bankruptcy of literature .

		If bankruptcy be the failure to meet just obligations , there is a good deal to be said for the view that modern literature is dangerously close to the insolvent state .

		When financial disaster of this sort is near , its proximity is usually indicated by a frantic straining for the extension of credit .

		Every manner of make - shift is resorted to for the purpose of staving off the crisis and regaining the prestige that is on the point of irrecoverable loss .

		No terms could more exactly describe the devices by which a large proportion of our modern writers seek to relieve a situation which they feel to be des - perate ; no metaphor more exactly fits their case than that of a credit strained almost to the breaking-point .

		No other explanation can ac - count with any degree of satisfaction for the fashion in which their vocabularies are tricked out with technicalities and neologisms , for the reckless way in which they riot in the bizarre and the paradoxical , for the intellectual and ethical audacities in which they indulge .

		To achieve novelty at whatever cost is the sum of their ambition , for thus alone is their poverty - stricken estate to be for a time concealed .

		If they can make themselves sufficiently startling , they may hope to seem impressive .

		That the hope is not altogether futile may be gathered from a glance at the vogue of such men as 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	,
Nietzsche	PERSON	and Gorky and d'
Annunzio	PERSON	and Whit - man and
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		It may also be gathered from a study of many of the rep - utations that have recently been made in the domain of philosophical speculation , and in the futile fields of pedagogical and sociological and psychical theory .

		Neither these men nor these opinions are to be ignored , for they obtrude themselves too promi - nently into the foreground of contemporary thought .

		Nor do they deserve to be wholly disregarded ; because , apart from their symp - tomatic significance , they embody a real stirring of the waters which they make so turbid .

		But by just so far as they depart from normal forms of expression and normal modes of thought they become objects of rightful suspicion , and the more startling the departure the greater the probability that they are offering mere irrational vagary as a substitute for orderly cerebration .

		It amounts to a practical confession of judg - ment in the bankruptcy court for a writer to offer for his stock in trade such unrealizable assets as the '' precious '' vocabulary and the unfettered period , such evidences of intellectual ineptitude as glaring paradox and unrestrained sensibility .

		These ways of doing a literary business may be defended by fine-sounding phrases -- '' enriching the language , '' '' increas - ing the flexibility of utterance , '' `` liberating the spirit from tradition , '' and '' unsealing the springs of sympathy , '' -- but the argument rings hollow .

		Neither the substance of thought nor the form which it contrives for its expres - sive service is as wholly a matter of fashion as our modern sophists would have us believe ; the human spirit has accumulated a certain amount of fixed capital in fairly permanent embodiment during its three thousand years , more or less , of unwearying effort .

		The trouble seems to be that our modern speculative fever has got into literature and other places where it does not belong , and the methods of '' frenzied finance '' are found profit - able -LRB- for the time being -RRB- by many of our poets and novelists and dramatic purveyors , even by our educators and sociologists and philosophers .

		So we have '' booms '' in such specialties as rhapsodical prose and degraded speech and the exploitation of sensual situations , in such revolts -LRB- sometimes revolting enough -RRB- as march under the red banners of new thought and free love and pragmatism .

		We are terrorized by educa - tional ideals that take small account of the soul , and social ideals that would overthrow the very citadel of individualism , and political ideals that are subversive of most old-fashioned notions about the sanctity of human rights .

		All these are perhaps passing phenomena , but they press upon our attention to somewhat trying effect , and the whole wildcat movement is pretty dis - couraging to those who know enough of history to understand the value of credit and stability in the operations of the intellectual market .

		The case of literature , while by no means hopeless , is far more serious than the case of science , as the latter is viewed through the spectacles of prejudice by
M. Brunetiere	PERSON	.

		The recent progress of science is marked by really definite and brilliant achievements , and its out - look was never more promising .

		But literature , if not on the verge of bankruptcy , is at least threatened by an impairment of credit for which the natural remedy would be a drastic overhaul - ing of its securities and a general retrenchment in most directions .

		There are no evident signs that this remedy is likely to be applied .

		The number of people who write flimsy novels and perpetrate bad poems and bad plays goes on steadily increasing , and the number of editors and publishers who encourage these misguided persons seems to grow at nearly the same rate .

		Then in addition to all this legitimate if ill - advised competition on either side , there is the disturbing element supplied by the host of aspi - rants for literary fame who are so assured of their own merits that no rejection deters them , and who print at their own expense the immortal works that can find no one else to stake money upon their success .

		Clearly , the threatening debacle will not be averted by a sudden growth of self-restraint .

		During the
last half-century	DATE	the world has passed through one of the golden ages of litera - ture ; but the age in which we now live is at best one of silver , if not one of lead or plated metal .

		The most enthusiastic spokesman of modernity would not claim for the best score of living writers anything like a parity of im - portance with the best score of those whose deaths we have been called upon to chronicle with such painful frequency since
1880	DATE	.

		We welcome new writers like Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	and Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	and Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, but the best we can say of them is that they reflect something of the glory of their great predecessors and exemplars .

		And those who do not thus shine by a borrowed light are pretty apt to force themselves upon our attention by their shrill or falsetto voices , and by their bad literary manners , rather than by any display of the literary graces . ''

		Politics

		THE DIAL 229 and private avarice make the air we breathe thick and fat , '' said
Emerson	PERSON	in
1837	DATE	; and it would not be a bad diagnosis of our present condition .

		Both of the de-spiritualizing influ - ences that he then named are now even more active among men the world over , and they make themselves felt in literature as in every other really vital human concern .

		And the many disillusionments that the later years have brought us have in some measure choked the springs of hope that sustained the faith of our forefathers a century ago .

		BERNARD SHA W IN
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		Although the name of
Bernard Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is , in a popular sense , all but unknown in
France	LOCATION	, -- less known , indeed , than it is in
America	LOCATION	, and according to accounts than it is in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	, -- yet his work has been examined with great thorough - ness by the students and critics who have interested themselves in it , with the result that their comments are notably free from traces of that idle chatter which has been a dominating element in his recep - tion elsewhere .

		The
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	movement , as it may now be called , seems to be confined to university consideration on the one hand , and to the discussion arising from the production of one of the plays in
Paris	LOCATION	on the other .

		Last winter no less than four
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	courses were given to university audiences -- at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, at
Brussels	LOCATION	, at
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, and at
Geneva	LOCATION	.

		Considering the fact that it is less than four years since the first extended article on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	appeared in a French review , the assumption may be made of a genuine extension of interest .

		The author of the article referred to was
M. Jean Blum	PERSON	, a native of
Paris	LOCATION	, who has been a professor of German at Turcoing and at
Oran	LOCATION	, and is also interested in contemporary English letters .

		He modestly admits that he could not literally have been the first to introduce
Shaw	PERSON	to his countrymen , as several notices had appeared in print previously , some of them as early as
1897	DATE	or
1898	DATE	.

		Neverthe - less , to
M. Blum	PERSON	beyond doubt is due the credit of being the first to write on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	at length , at first hand , and quite independently of his reception in
England	LOCATION	.

		It may safely be said that such an intro - duction has had not a little to do with keeping the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	movement free from the absurdities of fad - dism ; for
M. Blum	PERSON	's presentation , instead of being indiscriminately eulogistic , was thoughtful and mod - erate .

		The man who has written and spoken most on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, and the one most widely known as his expounder , is
M. Augustin Hamon	PERSON	, who with his wife has recently completed the authorized French version of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's works .


M. Hamon	PERSON	, when asked by the author to undertake the translation of his entire work , accepted for the socialistic and poli - tical tracts , but not for the plays , regretting that as he himself was not a dramatist he did not feel quali - fied for the task .

		Shaw would not accept the excuse , writing : '' I know well what I am doing .

		The vivacity of certain accounts of yours of Socialistic Congresses has convinced me that you are the man to write a French version of my comedies .

		You know modern society and human nature , and that is the important part in the work which I ask you to undertake . ''

		The translator was a
Paris	LOCATION	student , and is now a
Brussels	LOCATION	Professor .

		He is a copious writer , and a contributor to influential periodicals in half a dozen countries .

		The drift of his mind may be inferred from the titles of his books .

		He joins hands with
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	in anti-militarism ; and his work on '' The Psychology of the Professional Soldier '' got him into serious trouble .

		It is said that because of this book , and after the affair of the anarchists
Henry	ORGANIZATION	and
Caserio	PERSON	, the author left
France	LOCATION	for some months , for
England	LOCATION	, where he contributed to the '' Free Review '' and '' Liberty , '' and wrote '' The
Psychol	PERSON	- ogy of the Socialistic Anarchist . ''

		With such a record , it is perhaps less strange that
M. Hamon	PERSON	should find in
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	one who shares his views than that he should see anything else in him .


M. Hamon	PERSON	seems , in fact , to be the only French critic of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	who is a socialist , or who has been drawn to
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	by this bond of sympathy .

		He is the most zealous , the most enthusiastic , the most eulogistic Shawite in
France	LOCATION	.

		He regards
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's works as the dramatic expression of ideas which he himself had expounded in pamphlets and on the platform .

		M. Hamon de - livered a series of lectures on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	at the Sorbonne the
past winter	DATE	, and their success is shown by the recent announcement of a second series for the current session .

		M.
Charles Cestre	PERSON	, formerly of Dijon and of
Lyons	PERSON	, and recently appointed professor of English in the
University of Bordeaux	ORGANIZATION	, delivered there a series on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, which was better attended than lec - tures of like character have been for years .

		The publication of these lectures is called for ; and it is probable that
M. Cestre	PERSON	-LRB- who is a
Harvard A.M.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be his own translator into English .

		M. Cestre 's pre - vious books , dealing with French ideas of social democ - racy as they affected
England	LOCATION	at the time of the Revo - lution , have qualified him peculiarly for a discussion of this exponent of the modern spirit .

		The fact that the
Bordeaux	LOCATION	professor is not a socialist , and that , while sympathetic , his approval and admiration are qualified , enhances the value of his work , and at the same time shows the rational character of the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	movement .

		M.
Henri Odier	PERSON	, a graduate of the
University of Berne	ORGANIZATION	, with a thesis on the psychology of words and a work in prospect on
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, lately gave a short series of lectures on
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	at the Athe ` ne'e of
Geneva	LOCATION	; and these lectures are now in press .


M. Palante	PERSON	, professor of philosophy at
St. Brieuc	LOCATION	, has also lectured on the same subject ; and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	has been commented upon in the periodicals by such 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, men as MM .

		Henri de Re ` gnier ,
Adolphe Brisson	PERSON	,
Henri Bidou	PERSON	,
Firmin Roz	PERSON	,
Ernest Charles	PERSON	,
Gaston Rageot	PERSON	,
Regis Michaud	PERSON	,
Raymond Recouly	PERSON	, and others .

		Only those writers who are taken seri - ously have the sources of their ideas investigated ; and there has hardly been a French reviewer who has not suggested a philosopher or dramatist as a test of comparison with
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		That the names thus brought out are so often the same shows at least the existence of a standard .

		One critic ,
M. Michaud	PERSON	, says that , as a revolutionary ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is to be thought of with
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Morris	PERSON	; and he is credited with familiarity with
Darwin	PERSON	,
Spencer	PERSON	, and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		In the apology of faith versus works , of spontaneity and sincerity against the formalism of institutions , of individuality against appearances ,
M. Roz	PERSON	finds signs of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's ideals in
Bunyan	LOCATION	's great allegory .

		But the two names invari - ably brought forward in the longer reviews are
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, -- and this in spite of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's retort to his English reviewers regarding his debt to
Charles Lever	PERSON	,
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, and others still less known .

		Ibsen held that our modern conception of virtue holds us in real slavery .

		The quintessence of Ibsenism , according to
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, is in the destruction of this conception , of this ideal ; this , according to
M. Blum	PERSON	, is the bond between the two , the founda - tion on which
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	builds his philosophy .

		M. Rageot notes that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's mission is comparable to that of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, as shown in their fondness for moral problems and in their treatment of anguish of con - science .

		On the dramatic side as well ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is said to have learned from the Norwegian the art of joining exposition to action .

		Points of dissimilarity , on the other hand , are not wanting .

		Chief of these is that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is essentially comic , while
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is mainly tragic .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's optimism contrasts with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's pessimism .

		M. Odier calls Ibsen individualistic ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	social .


M. Hamon	PERSON	claims that from the social point of view ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's work is richer and deeper than
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's ; that in
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's work the lower classes play a more important part ; that he is not interested , as
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is , in social pathology ; and that woman is considered by
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	more realistically , in contrast with the comparative idealism of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's treatment .

		Upon the appearance of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's `` The
Quint	PERSON	- essence of Ibsenism , '' the Germans discovered the author 's affinity with
Nietzsche	PERSON	, whom he then began to study .

		The result is held to have been a recog - nizable obligation and similarity as clear as that with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and followed likewise by points of disagree - ment .

		Nietzsche explained European nihilism by the intermingling of masters and slaves , by the dis - appearance of castes ; he believed the Superman to be realizable by a small number of masters rigor - ously separated from the troop of slaves .

		Superman is the aim and ideal of his thesis , caste regime but a means ; if this means be ill-chosen , it must be changed .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's divergence from an older conception of socialism lies in distinguishing between the emo - tional element and what has clumsily been called the scientific element .

		The first he regards as unneces - sary , and even as unworthy of socialism .

		By means of the second he attempts to sever the old union of moral romanticism and socialism .

		For this purpose he borrowed from
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	both the word and idea of Superman , declaring that the aspira - tion to the Superman and its preaching by
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	accords with the religious precept , `` Ye must be born again . ''

		But as opposed to what might be called the class philosophy of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	holds that the two fundamental institutions of our society , property and marriage , are unfavorable to the ad - vent of Superman .

		The opposite opinion arose from the fallacy that men could be bred for the develop - ment of particular traits , just as cocks are bred for their combative qualities .

		On the contrary , what in man is really important we do not yet clearly under - stand .

		It is the '' inconscient '' which is the living source of all his energies .

		After selection we must trust to instinct .

		Shaw then falls back on communism for methods and means for the attainment of the ideal of Superman .

		In other words , his synthesis com - bines real communism with the fundamental tenet of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		The leading critics are in the main agreed on this point .

		M. Cestre arrives at prac - tically the same conclusion from another viewpoint , hinting that
Nietzsche	PERSON	is a variation of
Carlyle	LOCATION	; and he adds that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is a democratic
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		The only one of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's plays that has yet been acted in the French-speaking world is ''
Candida	PERSON	, '' and that was first played , not in the French but in the Belgian capital .

		It seems to have been a sub - stantial success -- due partly to the fact that it was well acted , but doubtless still more to the intelligent interest aroused by a discourse on the dramatist 's work , and an exposition of `` Candida '' in particu - lar , which
M. Hamon	PERSON	delivered immediately before the performance .


M. Brisson	PERSON	regrets that the
Paris	LOCATION	production had no such preliminary explanation ; the dramatis personm , he comments , escape classifi - cation , are incomprehensible to the Frenchman , and disconcert him . ''

		The atmosphere chills ; we feel that we are not in touch with the author .

		Eugene exasperates ,
Burgess	PERSON	seems caricatured .

		Yet there is a creative force , a desire to ignore the superficial and to dig down to the naked truth ; there is a beauty which I only perceive in spots , and I more than regret my lack of comprehension .

		Candida is not ours .

		An effort is necessary in order to fathom her .

		In many of our plays we see a woman obsessed by a husband and a lover , hesitating between the two , or resigning herself to both .

		The moment we under - stand her character we foresee the conclusion .

		Can - dida does not belong to any of our categories ; she is apart . ''

		M. Bidou calls
Candida	PERSON	an embodiment of charity , reason , and love . ''

		She has the good sense that belongs to our race .

		Does she not get her reasonableness from the Celtic spirit , which is as practical as it is imaginative ?

		An Ibsen heroine would have acted otherwise . ''

		Another critic calls attention to the '' Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	'' as being anti-social in comparison with
Candida	PERSON	.

		MM .

		Hamon and
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 Cestre are of conflicting opinions in regard to the wife 's motive for staying with her husband , -- the one holding that it is from love , not from duty , the other contending that
Candida	PERSON	believes it her duty to remain with the man who needs her most .

		M. Recouly , speaking of
Morell	PERSON	, asks : `` This need of setting forth so candidly his conjugal felicity , and associating the kingdom of heaven with the joys of married life , this mania of preaching to the young celibate , urging him to take his part of a God-given happiness , -- is it not for all the world like a British clergyman ? ''

		The
Paris	LOCATION	production of '' Candida '' was a dis - tinctly literary enterprise , and on the whole was coldly received .

		The piece was generally regarded as too remarkable to be laughed at , and many con - fessed that its originality gave them pause ; but also that they did not understand it .

		Frenchwomen , it has been said , understand
Candida	PERSON	but do not accept her .

		Some think that the play which should have been presented first is '' Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession , '' and this notwithstanding its resemblance to
Maupas	LOCATION	- sant 's ''
Yvette	PERSON	. ''

		But from this
M. Michaud	PERSON	dis - sents .

		There is no danger , he says , that from a given situation
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	will draw conclusions that either seem to be logical or that are ever twice the same .

		He seems to take pleasure in this , and in inserting in the same play ideas most opposed to each other .

		In this art he excels ; and it is appar - ently the most substantial profit that he gets .

		Allied to the question of feminism , of which Lady Cicely and Mrs.
Clandon	PERSON	are but two out of many examples , is the question of love and its treatment in ways that are novel to the French public .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's ignoring of the unpleasant aspects of realism , in con - trast to Ibsen or to
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, has been the subject of no more comment than the absence of physical pas - sion .

		This gives rise to types absolutely unknown to the French stage , such as the chaste bachelor , the Philanderer .

		There is not in
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	the sentimen - talism of corruption of which
Murger	PERSON	's `` La Vie de Boheme '' is an instance .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	, according to
M. Cestre	PERSON	, influenced
Shaw	PERSON	and his theory of love , in that with him love has a physical basis and moral effects .

		The idealism with which love is surrounded is only a trap which nature sets for us to ensure the perpetuation of the race .

		Love , while thus losing its poetry in a way , none the less has a noble moral beauty , binding us to nature and revealing our responsibilities .

		The special manner in which
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	treats love as a duel between the sexes is quite new to the French .

		Exultation in love is the summit of strength , of courage , the triumph of impulse over individualism .

		Valentine , for example , in `` You Never Can Tell , '' feels that the triumph of love in him is a defeat of his nature , a surrendering of individualism .

		The duel is found in `` Man and Superman , '' the genius of producing life in the woman versus the genius of producing thought in man .

		Quite different also is the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	way from that of
Dumas	PERSON	, in whose work a plot hangs on a custom or legal detail . ''

		Divorce '' deals with a special point of legislation ; whereas with
Shaw	PERSON	there is a thesis of general psychology , of love in general , and of marriage considered as a psychological event .

		This aspect of his work is , however , not the only point of interest .

		The employment of three kinds of background is noted : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the historic , as in '' The Devil 's Disciple '' and ''
Antony	PERSON	and
Cleo	PERSON	- patra '' ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- an exotic setting , a world of surprise , accepted by the English , too extravagant for the French ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- a setting not exotic , but strange , as the
Ibsen Club	ORGANIZATION	in '' The Philanderer , '' or the transfor - mation of the upper circle in '' Major Barbara . ''

		The variety of the minor or episodic characters is unchallenged , but there are diverse views in regard to the major ones .

		M. Cestre may not voice the cur - rent Anglo-Saxon opinion when he says that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's men are portraits of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		The women too , the lecturer adds , do not have the same com - plexity or the same conformity to the conditions of life that women of the French theatre have .


Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's successful character-differentiation is the accident of fertile invention , not the outcome of interest in the individual .

		Notwithstanding the entente cordiale , the French still delight in jibes of the olden time ; and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's caustic remarks to his native audience delight their hearts .

		Here is one explanation of how he cap - tured
London	LOCATION	: in a country where the theatre was chiefly given to dancing , a man appeared whose plays made people think .

		Intelligent and literate spectators , like people who have fasted for too long , threw themselves on the new food , carrying along with them the snobs who abound there in greater numbers than anywhere else in the world .

		In this way was
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's success made .

		Another critic adds : thus
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, with almost excessive but sincere auda - city , an almost heroic perseverance , a fantasy and an ingenuity ceaselessly renewed , is the English writer who has best shown the practical and moral - izing genius of this nation of shopkeepers , which is never in want of principles to justify her interests .

		This explains the resistance and the favor met with in
England	LOCATION	by this too clear-sighted , indiscreet , and amusing moralist .

		Still other explanations follow :
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	audiences had difficulty in under - standing him , because his vision of things was not like theirs , perverted by prejudices , by obscure sen - timents , and by ill-formed ideas .

		He was indiffer - ent to what seemed to them capital questions , and curious about others which they wondered were asked .

		He has revealed to his compatriots the French disrespect ; and if not the only one , is at least the one who has proclaimed most loudly that all is not for the best in the best of empires .

		This attitude of mind brings forth such an inter - pretation of '' Candida '' as
M. Rageot 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The play gives us a glimpse , he says , of what we shall like in
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, and what will , he believes , always escape us in his vigorous and combative talent .

		Above all a satirist , he observes the vices of English social life , and excels in expressing the secret restlessness of certain minds which suffocate in that puritan atmos - 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, phere , under the national mask of respectability .

		The English mind lives in an atmosphere of false - hood and illusion . ''

		Candida '' is a vigorous attack against false religion -LRB- English -RRB- , against clergymen who live by it , and against hypocritical adepts who keep it up .

		It is the more telling because of its precision and moderation .

		What stings the English to the quick is hardly felt by the French , who remain strangers to the foundation of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's works , social satire .

		The French are , of course , convinced that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	has an excellent subject in satirizing English life .

		They are equally sure that whatever in him is re - markable is French , and that they should recognize him as one of themselves .

		M.
Blum	PERSON	frankly states that in his opinion it will be
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's fate to fail , by reason of the very French qualities which have secured his success in
England	LOCATION	.

		M. Odier -- who , it should be remembered , is Swiss -- writes that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's seemingly light wit may prevent the French from appreciating his common-sense , and will cause him to be regarded by most serious people as a char - latan .

		M. Odier holds , with
M. Blum	PERSON	, that there is in
France	LOCATION	to-day such a large element of readers and playgoers who are enamoured of the exotic and the revolutionary in literature , that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	may be the object of an artificial vogue like that of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, who has never really taken with the French public .


M. Brisson	PERSON	writes that it is as inevitable that there should be Shawites as that there have been Ibsenites , but that such a phenomenon has at least the advan - tage of enlarging taste .

		M.
Blum	PERSON	presents a detailed comparison of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and
Beaumarchais	LOCATION	; and
M. Hamon	PERSON	a much fuller one between
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, heralding the latter as the successor of the former , and as the scorner of nineteenth century models , Scribe in particular .


M. Hamon	PERSON	finds
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's work un-English , and has no doubt of its ultimate acceptance in
France	LOCATION	.


M. Rageot	PERSON	says there is real intellectual relationship between
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and the French ; for if fundamentally he resembles
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and seems to have been influenced by
Tolstoi	PERSON	and
Nietzsche	PERSON	, by the form and turn of his mind he is related to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		Like them , he handles irony , which is the only weapon of satire , and which is essentially French .


M. Michaud	PERSON	's words are to the same effect .

		Translated into our tongue , he notes ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	will belong to us by more than one right : equally by the social , intellectual , and Utopian elements in his work .

		Although he does not admire our stage , -- he rates
Duse	PERSON	above
Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	, does not enjoy Musset , still less
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	, Coppe'e , and
Rostand	PERSON	, and seems to prefer the The - atre de 1 ` CEuvre to that of the Boulevards , -- yet he knows that we are of the country of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and of
Coquelin	LOCATION	, that our greatest lyric poet is the author of '' Les Mise ` rables , '' and that our purest esthete placed `` Monsieur
Bergeret	PERSON	'' side by side with the English Lake Poets and with
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		Discussion of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	as a philosopher is apt to stop with mere acknowledgement of his suggestiveness .

		M.
Blum	PERSON	calls him dramatist and philosopher in equal degree ; but doubtless the most eulogistic claim comes from
M. Roz	PERSON	.

		Shaw styles himself a philoso - pher , he writes ; that is true , provided this word calls to our minds , not Descartes or
Spencer	PERSON	, but rather
Anatole France	LOCATION	.

		In effect , if
Anatole France	LOCATION	had been inspired by
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, rather than by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and Renan , thus being or appearing to be more profound , and let the wings of his fancy float in metaphysics , he could almost give us the idea of
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		Though cognizant of the formidable obstacles which must be overcome if
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's reputation is to cross the Chan - nel ,
M. Cestre	PERSON	is none the less hopeful of ultimate success .

		Summing up the essential factors of the situation , he says in substance : One of the leading characteristics of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, which ought to call for sympathy in the French mind , is the combination of the power of observation and of portraiture with the philosophical imagination and the reformer 's enthusiasm .

		We are not likely to take so much interest in the metaphysics of the third act of '' Man and Superman '' as in the psychology spread through - out the play .

		We do not have the longing of Ger - manic peoples for the solution of the riddle of the universe .

		We are content to take the cosmos on credit , and are rather attracted by artists and thinkers who search far and deep into the complex world of emotions and motives .

		Shaw puzzles French readers by the -LRB- to them -RRB- outlandishness of the characters and manners of his plays .

		They are not shocked by his onslaughts on respectability and piety , for these bogies have long been exploded in
France	LOCATION	; but it is their sense of literary propriety , their inborn regard for sentiment , that are uncomfortably shaken .

		Shaw needs to be explained to them ; but I dare say his intellectuality , his keenness and boldness in handling moral questions , his art and his wit , will in the long run be appreciated .

		Apt as the French are to worship literary canons , they will have to be gently initiated into a new form of problem play .


Alexander Dumas	PERSON	and his disciples opposed on the stage the individual passions or collective prejudices whence spring social evil , or they dramatized the conflict of feelings which arise from the marriage laws .

		But no French dramatist has yet done what
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	so well succeeds in doing , -- describing the ethics of a future state of society involved in a pic - ture of present-day manners , and attributing to his characters unwonted feelings and unusual motives of action , while making them living and likable , in so many ways of our own kith and kin .

		It may be too early to predict whether or not
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's name in
France	LOCATION	will be known only to the few , like
Swinburne	PERSON	's or Meredith 's , or become a veritable household word like Kipling 's or like
Wells 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		A hopeful interpretation may be put on the comparative disregard of his superficial quali - ties , such as paradox and verbal brilliancy , to the advantage of psychologic and social phases .

		To think of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, even tentatively , as the English Anatole
France	LOCATION	, seems to have a certain attraction for the latter 's compatriots .

		It would be quite
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 unfair to say , although the comparison has been frequently remarked , that it has been made too much of .

		The fact itself suffices to show how - respectful the consensus of French opinion is .

		The contrast in the two estimates could not perhaps be more glaringly illustrated than in the reflection of the probable effect in
America	LOCATION	, if not in
England	LOCATION	, of a serious discussion of the author of `` L'He des Pingouins '' as the
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	.

		Opinions about
Brown	PERSON	will long be divided , '' he i says in a characteristic passage of his circular , '' but opinions are not history , and ought not to be the main stuff of biography .

		Facts of uncontested value make the staple of my book , and though I ' ■ have not avoided the expression of opinion , that part of the book has been based on the careful examination of conflicting evidence . ''

		The first vol - ume of the author 's recent • ' Recollections of Seventy !

S. G. Howe	PERSON	, '' published nineteen years ago , gives further particulars ; and the final volume of his edition of
Theodore Parker	PERSON	's works , to appear soon , '' will set forth , more fully than elsewhere , the connection of that eminent man with
Brown	PERSON	and his plans . ''

		But the biography itself , a work of about 650 pages , is indispensable to the student of

		I 'm reading this book you kindly sent to me , '' he remarked , '' and I am much interested .

		I find that it fits my present need better than anything else .

		I can read it backward or forward , just as I used to read Emerson . ''

		Invited to walk across the campus with his host to his laboratory , the friend paused on the way to point to a cluster of chicory in full bloom , and to say : '' I find myself coming to the conviction that the biologists are wrong in their conception that the bloom of a plant is related simply to the propa - gation of the species .

		To me it seems that beauty is the real object and purpose of the world of flowers . ''

		To this heterodox utterance the scientist most unex - pectedly and impressively replied : M You are right . ''

		So modest was his estimate of the value of his own contributions to science that he parted with an im - portant invention in telegraphy to the
Western Union Company	ORGANIZATION	for less than one-seventh of what that wealthy corporation was fully prepared to pay the inventor .

		He had simply named the amount that would lift a mortgage then resting on his house , and perhaps leave him a little over , and counted himself fortunate to have his price accepted .

		With his many important inventions in connection with the tele - graph and the telephone -- including telegraphing without wires , now so widely and successfully used -- the one referred to seemed but a little thing , and he valued it according to its cost to him , not by its usefulness to others .

		For simple , vigorous , idiomatic English , setting forth the life-history of one whose missionary experience and acute observations were richly worth recording , there is nothing to be compared with the Wesleyan journals .


George Fox	PERSON	's record of his sufferings and his missionary labors is a wonderful work , but lacks the variety and vivacity of
Wesley	LOCATION	's story .

		When one recalls that the founder of Methodism travelled , by his own account , more than four thousand miles a year for about sixty years -- or a quarter-million miles in all -- it is no wonder his journals possess life and embrace a wide range of topics .

		The edi - tor 's four years of puzzling over the mysterious cipher , and the happy solution of the problem that came to him in a dream , contribute to make this first complete edition of the journals a memorable work .

		• • • The need of a neutral pronoun , or pronoun of common gender and applicable to either man or woman , boy or girl , is vaguely felt by even the least reflective speaker or writer .

		Every now and then an arbitrary formation -LRB- like thon , for instance -RRB- is des - perately put forward for adoption by some language - mender ; but the great general public , and even the smaller learned and literary and philological public , refuse to have anything to do with the queer-looking thing -- perhaps suspecting it of being an emanation of reformed spelling , rather than a new word .

		Our English cousins bluntly meet the emergency , when it arises , by throwing grammar into the
North Sea	LOCATION	and letting '' they '' and '' their '' and `` them '' stand for `` he or she , '' `` his or her , '' and `` him or her , '' respectively .

		Authors of repute calmly write such sentences as this : It is everybody 's duty to love their country .

		It may be that this use of a plural pronoun in place of that neutral singular which half a thousand years or more have failed to evolve for us , is the best that can now be hoped for .

		Made - to-order words , like made-to-order spellings , are things that the public has little stomach for .

		The
Mankato Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is probably unknown to ninety-nine general readers out of a hundred -- possibly to an even larger proportion .

		In fact ,
Mankato	LOCATION	itself might not be quickly and correctly located by more than two out of every twenty-five of these same '' general readers . ''

		It is a
Minnesota	LOCATION	city , of about twelve thousand inhabi - tants , eighty miles or so from
St. Paul	LOCATION	, in a south - westerly direction ; it is the reputable seat of a highly reputable
State Normal School	ORGANIZATION	; and its citizens maintain a good and useful and wide-awake library .

		But what especially strikes one , in reading the libra - rian 's sixteenth annual report , is the liberality of the Mankatoans to their library employees in respect to vacations and leaves of absence . ''

		The extension of vacation from three weeks to a month , '' we read , '' and the extra week allowed for attendance at the
A. L. A.	PERSON	conference , were very much appreciated by both librarian and assistant , as was also the privilege granted the assistant to attend the state meeting at
Duluth	LOCATION	. ''

		Moreover , an examination of the ``
Finan	PERSON	- cial Report '' of the
Mankato Library	ORGANIZATION	seems to reveal a praiseworthy liberality in the matter of salaries -- for so small a city .

		Much is being written and said about the inadequate pay of library workers and their too close confinement .

		Encouraging , therefore , are these signs of a better order of things at Man - kato , whose enlightened policy may well be adopted elsewhere .

		The rapid growth of the English language , in number of words and in new meanings for old words , is reflected in the increasing size of our dic - tionaries .

		The indispensable ''
Webster	PERSON	'' reappears at short intervals in more and more plethoric form ; and now the publishers of the '' Century Dictionary , '' which first appeared in
1891	DATE	, are about to offer two supplementary volumes containing nearly a hundred thousand new words , new uses of old words , and new items in the proper-name division , with nineteen hundred new illustrations , and other less important additions .

		Owners of the previously issued volumes are to be favored in the distribution of the new ones , and then the price will be advanced for the public in general .

		The reason why our language contains more words than any other European tongue is obvious enough .

		Its wide distribution over two hemi - spheres , among peoples of invention and resource , who are constantly making discoveries in science and enlarging the bounds of knowledge , could not but insure its rapid growth .

		Moreover , its genius favors the formation of new compounds and the attachment of new meanings to old terms .

		It can be no restricted vocabulary that serves the needs of Briton and American , Australian and South African ,
East Indian	LOCATION	,
West Indian	LOCATION	, and
Philippine Islander	LOCATION	.

		• • • Librarian
Lummis	PERSON	's resignation of his
Los Angeles	LOCATION	position would be a matter for greater regret did it not involve the restoration of a highly original and useful worker to the fields of scientific and historical research and authorship .

		Mr.
Lum	PERSON	- mis 's five years ' management of the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has proved him a most resourceful , original , and energetic librarian .

		With a substantial basis of scholarship , but no false reverence for hoary tradition , he has made innovations that at first made his worthy associates gasp and stare .

		Who else
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 could ever have introduced the roof-garden idea into librarianism , or the poison-label for untrust - worthy books ?

		The roof-garden has proved a suc - cess , a crown of success , on the
Los Angeles	LOCATION	library .

		The poison-label is still on trial as to its practicability in libraries unequipped with a staff of experts in all departments of learning .

		Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	's varied adventures and extended travels over a large part of the western hemisphere , and his books describing those experiences and researches , would furnish matter for a long and unusually interesting article , or volume , which will doubtless some day be writ - ten .

		At present we have to note with regret his relinquishment of a task which he has shown him - self well fitted to perform , and to hail with satisfac - tion his re-entrance into the domain of authorship .

		After all , the pen is mightier than the
Dewey Decimal System	ORGANIZATION	.

		A renewal of the fight for Greek at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	reopens the interminable debate over the comparative claims of the humanities and the sciences .

		An essay on u How to Save Greek , '' from the pen of a Mr.
Snow	PERSON	, fellow of St.
John	PERSON	's , is made the text of a few approving comments by Dr.
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	, the well-known Grecian ; and although he had hitherto been inclined to relinquish compulsory classics at
Oxford	LOCATION	, Dr.
Murray	PERSON	now acknowledges the force of Mr.
Snow	PERSON	's argument , and would have both
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	remain true to the old traditions .

		These two old universities , he well observes , '' indisputably excel in a certain kind of literary , philosophic , and historical education based on the knowledge of antiquity , '' and therefore he would leave to other and less ancient seats of learn - ing the development of a school of English literature not grounded on the study of classical antiquity .

		Dwelling on this point further , he asks : '' Ought there not to be one place where English literature is taught , as a matter of course and necessity , with regard to its spiritual origins ? ''

		This is well .

		Yet it may be that in the progress of the centuries , and in the increasing strenuousness of modern life , Greek and Latin will be forced to yield to the stress even more than they have yet done -- much as Hebrew has to-day become an all but unknown tongue even to theologians .

		A periodical relapse might perhaps serve as a not unfit phrase to apply to the late abandonment of the journalistic struggle on the part of '' Putnam 's Magazine . ''

		Originally founded in
1853	DATE	by Mr.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	, the founder also of the Putnam house of publishers , and edited by
George William Curtis	PERSON	, the magazine received the support of such able pens as those of
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Stoddard	PERSON	, and
Stedman	PERSON	: but it suspended publication after only four years .

		Recalled to life half a century later -LRB-
1906	DATE	-RRB- by Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, the present head of the Putnam house , and given a rejuvenated appear - ance , with abundance of pictorial embellishment and special features , and absorbing into itself ' * The Critic '' -LRB- which had already assimilated '' The Literary World '' -RRB- and also `` The Reader , '' the combined enterprise has , like the old '' Putnam 's , '' enjoyed a four years ' existence .

		And now the new ''
Putnam	PERSON	's , '' with the predigested publications above - named , is swallowed at a gulp by another maga - zine of more vigorous constitution , '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		Fervently do we hope that the absorbing and merging process will go no further -- that the one distinctive magazine which makes its appeal on the ground of literary merit , and on that alone , will long be spared to the civilization which it does so much to promote and adorn .

		• • • A grain of Shakespearian wheat from a bushel of chaff is well worth the labor of win - nowing , to the scholar in quest of any slightest scrap of new information about the great poet .

		Professor
Charles William Wallace	PERSON	of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Nebraska	LOCATION	has beguiled a summer holiday by some toilsome researches in the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	at
London	LOCATION	, where mountains of ancient legal documents await the scrutiny of the antiquary and the historian .

		What the Nebraskan professor has gleaned affects not at all the question of the author - ship of the Shakespearian plays ; but it makes clear that Shakespeare at one time lived with a wig - maker 's family of the name of
Mountjoy	LOCATION	in Silver Street , that he was interested in its affairs , and that he appeared in a law court for these Mountjoys .

		Furthermore , a new signature is added to the few now ascribed to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's pen .

		This is suffi - ciently careless and lacking in clearness to be undoubtedly genuine .

		It reads `` Willm Shaks '' -- evidently a sort of personal mark rather than a complete signature , and throws but little light on the problem of whether or not the poet really knew how to spell his own name .

		A GATHERING OF THE DESCENDANTS OF GREAT poets , soon to be held in
London	LOCATION	, should be a rarely interesting occasion .

		The secretary of the
Poetry Recital Society	ORGANIZATION	, which is moving in the matter , has said : `` Among the most cheering facts that have come to light in our correspondence is that nearly all these descendants are comparatively well-to-do folk .

		The poets may have starved in their own day , but they have left their posterity in quite a number of cases remarkably well provided for .

		The greater proportion belong to the upper middle class .

		As regards the great poets themselves , there are , of course , some regrettable gaps .

		There is no actual descendant of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, though we have found descendants of his grandparents on both sides .

		Milton is yet wholly unrepresented , and the name of Keats seems to have vanished as though it had , in very truth , been ' writ in water . '

		Shelley has no living descendant , though of course the present Sir
John Shelley	PERSON	and others of the family are distant cousins . ''

Yankee Admiral	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Admiral
Evans	PERSON	's account of his naval service up to the close of the Spanish war has been fol - lowed by a volume of similar size and character , continuing the narrative to the author 's retire - ment from the navy , at the age of sixty-two , in
1908	DATE	. ''

		An Admiral 's Log '' is written in the same frank and straightforward style as the pre - vious volume , sometimes humorous and mildly sarcastic , but always holding the reader 's willing attention .

		After a brief opening chapter on '' The .

		Sampson-Schley Controversy , '' in which the writer 's sympathies are , as before , heartily on the side of Admiral
Sampson	PERSON	, he tells the story of the ridiculous trial of the Governor of
Samoa	LOCATION	.

		Admiral
Evans	PERSON	presided over the court - martial , as ordered by the Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	; and after relating the honorable acquittal of the accused , he permits himself this conclud - ing comment : '' In all my experience with courts-martial I have never known a case so weak as this one was , nor one where there was so little ground for charges .

		Upon my return to
Washington	LOCATION	I ascertained how the whole matter came about .

		The general impression was that the charges , or the complaint on which the charges were based , had in some way come from the mission - aries , but this was not the case .

		A letter in a woman 's hand-writing was received by the Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	reciting certain bad conduct on the part of the governor .

		The Secretary cut off the name of the writer and then sent the letter to the proper officers of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	, with an order to prepare the charges .

		Thus , practically on an anonymous letter , the expense of sending this court so many thousands of miles was incurred , not to mention the injury to the reputation and feelings of the officer , who up to that time had enjoyed a fine repu - tation . ''

		But , as the writer observes later , in connection with an official condemnation of certain indis - pensable survey work he was conducting in
Philippine	LOCATION	waters , '' swivel chairs sometimes have the effect of warping the judgment of those that occupy them . ''

		The author 's voyage to
Samoa	LOCATION	afforded him an opportunity to visit
Honolulu	LOCATION	, and he remarks in passing that the whole question of the defence of the
Sandwich Islands	ORGANIZATION	is a most difficult one , and that he is '' puzzled to understand how anyone , particu - larly a professional man , can consider them any - * An Admiral 's Log .

		thing but a source of weakness to us in case of war with any naval power in the
Pacific	LOCATION	. ''

		In such event , the defending army , 50,000 strong at least , would have to be fed from the
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia coast , more than two thousand miles distant .

		The most interesting events chronicled in the Admiral 's Log relate , of course , to his cruise in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	waters -LRB- with landings in
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	, and the
Philippines	LOCATION	-RRB- , and his conduct of the
Atlantic Fleet	ORGANIZATION	from
Hampton Roads	LOCATION	to
San Francisco	LOCATION	, in its famous round-the-world voyage .

		Speaking of President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's parting words to him just before the fleet left
Hampton Roads	ORGANIZATION	on its long cruise , the author says : '' On this occasion it was plain from his manner that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	felt deeply the importance of the step he had decided to take , and which had centred upon the navy of the
United States	LOCATION	the critical attention of the whole world .

		... I was most gratified to have the President say to me , as he did , < Remember , Admiral
Evans	PERSON	, you sail with the confidence of the President more completely than any admiral ever did before .

		Your cruise is a peaceful one , but you realise your responsibility if it should turn out otherwise ! ' ''

		And a little further on , illustrating the material from which war-scares are so often manufac - tured , we find this entry : '' Before the fleet sailed from
Hampton Roads	LOCATION	, I had seen several letters giving information that we were to be blown up and sunk on our way to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, the first attack being promised for Rio and the second in the Straits of
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the letters that I saw were anonymous , dated in
Canada	LOCATION	, and named either the Japanese government or the Japanese as the ones who were going to do us up .

		It seemed to me strange that the Japanese government should tell these men without names in
Canada	LOCATION	when and how they were going to de - stroy the battleships of a friendly nation !

		And I am free to confess that I considered the whole story un - worthy of notice . ''

		The sojourn in the
East	LOCATION	came at a rather criti - cal period .

		The Boxer insurrection had just been quelled , and the allied armies were en - camped before
Pekin	LOCATION	.

		An interview with the late
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	affords material for an interesting passage . ''

		The minister presented me in a few words to her Majesty , and , standing at a distance of about twenty feet , I repeated the speech I had sent her some days before -- at least a portion of it .

		She replied with the speech she had sent me , and then an unusual thing happened .

		She said to the minister through her inter - preter : ' Ask the Admiral to come near me ; I wish to converse with him . '

		... Then I looked into the eyes of this woman who ruled over four hundred millions of people , holding their lives and the destiny of her country in the hollow of her hand .

		Beautiful , appealing brown eyes looked back at me out of a face that must at one time have been strikingly beautiful .

		Every line of it indicated firmness and strength ; the mouth alone sug -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 gested cruelty , if occasion called for it .

		A more striking face , one to be longer remembered , I have never seen .

		...
The Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	spoke deliberately and with dignity .

		The interpreter received her words , bumped his head on the floor , raised his eyes , and repeated in English what she had said .

		I replied ; another bump of the head , and with downcast eyes he conveyed my message to her Majesty .

		Thus , for about twenty min - utes , the conversation continued , growing more inter - esting as she stated her side of the Boxer troubles , and the cruel punishment
China	LOCATION	had received , as a nation , for the doings of a band of outlaws .

		As the conversation progressed , the dark-brown eyes blazed , and I felt that it would be impossible for me to attempt to deceive the woman who was watching me so earnestly .

		Officially , she knew no word of English , but several times she started to reply before my words had been translated , which convinced me that she understood well every word I was saying .

		The rapid changes of expression on her face also led me to this conclusion .

		The inter - view concluded with these words from her Majesty : ' After all my country has suffered , I find she has but one friend in the world .

		That , Admiral , is the great country you represent . ' ''

		The author came away from the interview fully - aware that he '' had enjoyed the privilege of seeing the most remarkable woman in the world show her real feeling . ''

		In approaching the city of
Manila	LOCATION	, Admiral
Evans	PERSON	was curiously impressed by the sight of the stars and stripes flying in that part of the world . ''

		It caused a curious sensation , '' he writes , '' to see our beloved flag displayed over this foreign , tropical city , and I am not sure that I did not feel that it was out of place .

		However , there it was ; it had cost many valu - able lives to put it there , and it would cost many more before it could ever come down . ''

		This outcropping of sailor logic occurs again , even more characteristically , a few pages later , in describing a conversation with a malcontent native of influence and position . ''

		One could not argue with such a fool , '' he concludes . ''

		He , no doubt , represented a large class who were in a position to influence the feelings of the people .

		Education will in time remedy all this .

		If it does not , bullets and bayonets , I know , will . ''

		With Admiral
Evans	PERSON	's forced resignation -LRB- owing to illness -RRB- of the command of the fleet at
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and his retirement from the ser - vice soon afterward , we reach the end of the book -- a tip-top yarn , one may be allowed to call it , in the vernacular familiar to the sailor-author .

		There are some interesting portraits and illus - trations , of which the view of the fleet entering
San Francisco	LOCATION	harbor is the most impressive .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Novels or Xovelists j * Professor
Phelps	PERSON	's book on '' Modern Novel - ists '' is extremely interesting .

		It is about novelists some of whom are familiar and some unfamiliar except by name ; so that there is a pleasant variation of feeling about them , and yet a constant entertainment .

		The author knows all about them , too ; so that one feels confident , as one proceeds , that one will have no hasty though brilliant superficialities .

		He is original and independent ; so that we get the ideas of the critic instead of the conventionalities of current criticism .

		He -LRB- probably -RRB- differs from us in some respects ; so that we can have , as we read , the pleasing superior confidence that we know more than he does , in some things at least .

		This last feeling I have in one matter to an extreme degree : I feel that I know better than the author how his book should have been writ - ten .

		This is an idea not uncommon with critics and college professors , and in others I am apt to esteem it foolish .

		In this case , however , I think that Professor
Phelps	PERSON	should have written on Modern Novels instead of Modern Novelists .

		The biographical view of art or literature is very common nowadays .

		The reason is that almost everybody is interested in people , and very few in art , whether art in poetry , painting , music , or anything else .

		Hence a thousand persons , at least in
America	LOCATION	, like to hear what sort of man a given novelist is , for one who cares what sort of novels he writes .

		Of course Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	does not carry his biographical ten - dency so far as to fill his pages with personal gossip such as one reads in the literary maga - zines of the day .

		He is generally interested in the ideas and standpoints of his author , his philosophy of life and his Weltanschauung ; and he is so occupied with these things that he says very little about his novels as novels .

		You could read several of his essays , and , except by accident or other knowledge , you would not know that you were reading about a novelist rather than a dramatist , or even a poet or essayist .

		It is just as though critics wrote about Shakespeare without giving an idea that he was a writer of plays : indeed , that is the way they generally do write about him .

		Shake - speare 's view of life is what people like : of his way of expressing that view , they care little and know less .

		Of course Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	is not like that ; he often alludes to the art of the • Essays on Modern Novelists .

		238 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, novelist , -- but he is so absorbed in the intel - lectual personality of his subjects that he says but little about it .

		Now this position may be proper enough in some of the essays in this volume , but it is clearly inadequate in one -- namely , that on Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		Of most novelists , Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	is content to lay chief stress on the ideas .

		But Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	he holds to be a poor novelist , and therefore he must direct his attention to her novels .

		But it appears to me that although he makes it clear enough that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is not a keen or original observer , nor a deep thinker , he does not show that she does not write good novels .

		A little more on this point will be to the pre - sent purpose .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	gives the impression that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's reputation is only an immense vogue among women , and especially among the superficial readers of '' best sellers '' ; and that it is founded mostly upon the social respecta - bility of her books and her own journalistic sciolism .

		I am sure that this idea is incorrect .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is read and admired by many of the most cultivated and acute novel-readers of this country .

		I have read only two of her later novels , but I know a number of people of taste and appreciation who have read more and thought highly of them .

		From '' Lady Rose 's Daughter '' and '' The Marriage of
William Ashe	PERSON	, '' I have come to a different idea of her reputation from Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	.

		I believe that while people like to read her partly because -LRB- as Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	indicates -RRB- she flatters their idea that they are reading something very intellectual , dealing with great problems , etc. , the chief reason that they read her is because she writes good novels ; more particularly , because her novels are not only good , but in some especial directions extremely good .

		Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	, with his eye on the novelist , does not perceive this .

		It is hardly to the purpose to give here a critique on the art of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, especially as it would have to be based on a recollection of two of her many books .

		I merely wish to point out that Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	says almost nothing about it .

		He seems to think that she has no art , at least not enough to enable her to write '' su - premely well , '' and stand up to the test when '' compared with the great masters of fiction . ''

		I feel sure that , however correct this view may be in its results , Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	in stating it is neglecting a very important element in the study and criticism of fiction .

		Anybody who talks even a little with novelists of the day will per - ceive that they think there is something about novel-writing which is called '' technique . ''

		They usually think , also , that they have more of this article than
Scott	PERSON	, and doubtless other classic novelists , though
Scott	PERSON	is the one with whom they usually compare themselves .

		Their idea is that
Scott	PERSON	is a greater man , has a bigger view of life , a better grasp of character , a finer appreci - ation of nature , than they , so that his books are fundamentally more interesting than theirs ; but that in technique he is inferior .

		In this view I think they are fairly correct ; that is , there is at present a knowledge of a certain sort of technique in novel-writing that
Scott	PERSON	did not have .

		This technique may be something really fine , or it may not be ; but its result is to make a book interesting , to make people want to go on reading it when they have begun .

		It does not provide the novelist with ideas , but when he has any ideas it shows him how to handle them so as to be interesting .

		Just what this `` technique '' is , I have never been able to find out ; nor is it of any import - ance here , except to note that it consists largely of manipulation of plot so as to be interesting .

		This is only one element in the Complete Art of Novel-writing ; but it is an important one .

		It has been analyzed in various ways by different critics , and more or less obscurely understood by many novelists .

		But however analyzed and however understood , it seems to me that there is a certain way of telling a story that is better than other ways , in that it is interesting to the human mind in general .

		I should say that the '' way '' that was most widely and lastingly powerful was the best technique .

		How lasting is the power of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's method , I will not undertake to say .

		I fear it is not very perma - nent ; but that it is very wide in its appeal , including cultured and uncultured alike , seems to me obvious .

		In other words , she has art in her way more than
Mark Twain	PERSON	or
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, though they have in their ways more art than she , perhaps , or certainly more genius .

		And her way is more specifically the art of the nov - elist .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is best to be compared with
Sudermann	PERSON	.

		Both give superficial views on life in the guise of deep delvings in the mines of truth ; both instinctively play to the galleries .

		But both are great masters of one element -LRB- and that the same -RRB- of the art of novel-writing .

		Now all the preceding may be nonsense in de - tail .

		If it were my business to criticize Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, I should have to do it differently .

		But however wrong in detail , the main point is sensible enough -- namely , that there is an art of fiction , and that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	knows something about it , and that
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	, in his interest in ideas and subject - matter , in life and criticism of life , has forgotten to say much of anything on the subject .

		But , it may be asked , why should he say any - thing about it , if he prefers to write about something : else ?

		Why should not a man , even if he be especially well-read on something you think important , write on something that he thinks important ?

		Why would it not be well for you to write about Novels if you wish , and let Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	write about Novelists ?

		The main reason is that Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	himself really thinks that what I am talking about is the most important thing .

		He thinks that to concern oneself solely with novelists and their ideas is but a partial and incomplete way of studying literature .

		He says that '' the two most bene - ficial ways to study a novel are to regard it , first , as an art-form , and secondly , as a mani - festation of intellectual life '' -LRB- p. 249 -RRB- ; that '' the real object -LSB- of university study of novels -RSB- is to persuade him -LSB- the student -RSB- to read them intelligently , to observe the difference be - tween good novels and bad , and so to become impatient and disgusted with cheap , sensational , and counterfeit specimens of the novelist 's art '' -LRB- p. 248 -RRB- .

		It is true that this is said of a stu - dent 's reading ; but I believe it refers just as well to a professor 's writing .

		Not that Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	says nothing of the art of the novelist .

		He almost always does say something about it .

		But he usually mentions it as though it were something to be taken for granted , something that everybody knew all about , something quite obvious .

		But the art of the novelist is just the reverse of all this .

		It is something very subtle , something that com - paratively few people know anything about , something that would bear much explanation .

		If a novelist 's art be good , it will usually effect its purpose without our knowing that it is there .

		And that is the reason why it would be im - mensely interesting if anyone so well-read as Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	, in both theory and practice , would write criticism with a special view to it .

		We have had so much of criticism of life , of Welt - anschauung , of impressions de la vie , that the other thing would be a delight .

		It might create a new epoch in the history of criticism .

		But just now I note that a prominent journal calls this book '' a volume that bids fair to form a distinct and permanent landmark in the his - tory of fiction . ''

		I do not think so .

		But let everyone that cares which is right read the book and see .

		There is fun enough in that , anyway .

		* The flutter of a fan has often proved a momentous trifle .

		For the fan has been the pride and glory of kings and the plaything of queens ; it has made and unmade ministers , airily disposed of great affairs of state .

		It has masqued a coquette 's heart , beckoned a prince to try his fate in love , waved a general gaily off to war , inspired poets , hidden and evoked blushes , broken hearts and mended them .

		And all this it has been doing , if not ever since Eve walked in her garden , certainly since Cleopatra sailed up her

		A Spanish tale , recounted fittingly on a painted fan , declares that the first fan was a wing which Cupid tore from the back of Zephyrus , to fan Psyche as she slept on a bed of roses .

		The story has many variants , but all agree that Love created the fan , as he ani - mates its most effective uses .

		And now this trifle light as air has achieved due recognition of its real importance ; modern research has turned a search-light upon it , and its complete history has been written .

		There are many illustrations from plates made by the most skilled engravers ; and the edition is limited , in proportion to the beauty of embel - lishment and the somewhat esoteric interest of the text .

		Mr.
Rhead	PERSON	makes the most of the varied appeal -- archaeological , artistic , human -- of his airy subject .

		The earlier chapters are of a curious interest chiefly .

		In
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Assyria	LOCATION	, and
India	LOCATION	, the fan , like the other features of their ancient civilizations , was primitive , -- a useful fly-whisk or a richly ornate sacerdotal symbol or royal standard .

		It was left for
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	-- the two lands of fans -- to re-shape the crude early models ; to press into service ivory , silk , tortoise-shell , and mother-of-pearl ; to carve , lacquer , gild , and paint these rich ma - terials till they were more than ever things of beauty ; to invent the folding-fan , -- and finally to send their pretty treasures off to
Europe	LOCATION	in the ships of Portuguese traders , to set the western world agog over a new toy .

		There were special fans for every occasion in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , so important a part did -LRB- and does -RRB- the fan play in Japanese life that the greatest artists were not above decorating it .

		Tadahira , it is said , painted upon a fan a cuckoo that gave forth its characteristic note whenever the fan was opened , and
Tsunenori	PERSON	drew a lion so lifelike that other beasts fled before it .

		Beautiful as were the old Japanese fans , it took
France	LOCATION	and the
eighteenth century	DATE	to pro- duce the Golden Age of the art .

		Conversations Galantes furnished at once the best opportunity for adroit manipulation of the fan , and the ideal motive for its decoration .

		Spanish and Italian ladies got their fans from
Paris	LOCATION	; witness
Goldoni	LOCATION	's comedy , where the pother was all about a cheap little French fan , '' not worth perhaps five paoli . ''


Cano de Arevalo	PERSON	, a Span - ish painter , took advantage of this vogue for Parisian fans to `` fake '' a number of them .

		His trick was discovered ; but , by a logic that took small account of morals , he was thereupon hailed as a master and appointed fan-maker to the queen .

		If the French fan-painters were the acknowledged masters , the Spanish makers were wonderfully skilful in designing and deco - rating the sticks ; and the Spanish cavaliers and senoritas were the first to invent a fan language , which was later translated for the belles and beaux of other nations .

		During the first part of the eighteenth cen - tury the great vogue of fans led to the making of the engraved sort -- the fan of the people , the poor relation of the aristocratic painted fan .

		This new type speedily became the newspaper of the day .

		Royal foibles and adventures , fashions , politics , ballooning , scenes from plays and operas , all are depicted , usually with satirical or humor - ous verses by way of comment , on the engraved fan-mounts .

		In
France	LOCATION	,
Marlborough	LOCATION	was lam - pooned , the woes of
Louis	LOCATION	were mocked at or sympathized with ,
Napoleon	PERSON	's ups and downs were chronicled .

		In
England	LOCATION	the marriage of the Crown Princess and the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	was such a popular subject that
Jonathan Pinch	PERSON	- beck 's fan , which appeared first , was counter - feited , and the war between his
Nassau	ORGANIZATION	fan and its
New Nassau	ORGANIZATION	rival waged long and merrily in '' The Craftsman 's '' advertising columns . ''

		Church-fans '' appeared in
England	LOCATION	in the early part of the century , as a result of com - ments in the public journals on the unsuitability of the fan mounts often brought to church .

		A good woman 's heart divided among the cardinal virtues formed the chaste design of the first church-fan , which was speedily followed by a more pretentious one published under the patron - age of the Bishop of
London	LOCATION	, and by '' chapel - fans '' for dissenting ladies .

		To the next century belongs the feathered fan of
Hassein Dey	PERSON	, which actually caused a war ; for
Hassein	PERSON	hit the French consul over the head with his plumed fan , and refused to apologize , -- whereupon the French promptly set about the conquest of

		Mr.
Rhead	PERSON	's work is of course only incident - ally anecdotal .

		Passing fashions , in size , shape , decoration , and carving , are chronicled in detail .

		Illustrations are carefully described , and the fans of various periods and schools duly ap - praised as objets -LRB- Tart .

		For an art fan-making has been ; and , after a period of sad decline at the beginning of the nineteenth century , it is an art still .


Charles Conder	PERSON	's Red Fan , and Mr.
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	's Blue one , both reproduced in this book in full color , are comparable to any of the Italian masterpieces or the dainty marvels of the Great Age of Louis XV .

		The collector and the connoisseur will not fail to appreciate this , the first comprehensive history of fan-making in English .

		We have tried to point out its interest for the casual reader .

		Its beauty of illustration can not be overpraised .

		Twenty - seven colored plates , five times as many half tones , and innumerable little line drawings , reproduce fans odd , marvellous , unique , and beautiful , in generous profusion .

		Indeed , the work is an art treasure as truly as many of the famous fans it describes and depicts .

		THE DTAL 241 bourne whence no traveller returns , and whose towers and palaces we must as yet be content to see through the inspired eye of imagination .

		It was not to discourage him , nor to undervalue the great work that Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	had undertaken , that the reviewer suggested the possible advan - tage , to the student of life 's deeper and richer expression , of a certain line of attack in histori - cal research and presentation .

		General history is written to-day from the ethnic and psychologi - cal standpoint ; and why not also architectural history ?

		In the preface to the present volume , almost the last word which Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	ever wrote is his acknowledgment of The Dial 's '' suggestive '' criticism -LRB-
March 1 , 1907	DATE	-RRB- and the statement of his reason for not heeding the sug - gestion .

		The reason given does not altogether satisfy .

		It shows , not the bold imagination of the great explorer venturing out upon the main , but rather the studied caution of the coastwise trader .

		`` The arts of design , '' says this preface , '' are the result of the artistic impulse in man , of his disposition to record , to explain , what is beautiful in the world of nature , and to refine and beautify the work of man .

		That is enough for the artist to know .

		A lifetime of study and thought will not suffice to unfold all the charm and all the mystery of that simple creed ... Artistic beauty lies in light and shade and color : artistic interest lies in the skilful combination of those simple elements . ''

		But artistic truth is measured by broader standards ; and to know whether the artist is true to his age and environ - ment one must know something of the life and thought and character of that age as well as the superficial aspects of its artistic expression .

		It is a profound subject , of high import to the stu - dent of life ; and a history of architecture will some day be written in this spirit , but possibly not before many another critical history has been published .

		The Oriental styles lend themselves to such treatment much more readily than do the phases of the Romanesque treated in this volume , and the author 's lesser intimacy with the details of
Oriental	ORGANIZATION	architecture has permitted his thought to rim more parallel to the suggested channel .

		Throughout his exposition of the Moslem archi - tecture of
Persia	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	, of the architec - ture of
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and southwestern
Asia	LOCATION	, one feels the author 's subconscious relating of the art to the life and environment of the peoples .

		The chapters on the Romanesque are handled very much after the manner of the first volume , with thorough understanding and appre - ciation , which histories on kindred lines can do little more than augment .

		In the chapters on Oriental architecture there is too much matter in the text which performs the function of the footnote and should be relegated to that position .

		The volume is very attractive in its illustrations , typography , and mechanical make-up , maintaining the high standard set by Volume I .

		The preparation of the third volume is to be undertaken by Mr.
Arthur L. Frothingham	PERSON	, who , receiving his education abroad , has devoted his life to the study of architecture and archae - ology .

		With the full notes left by Mr.
Sturgis	PERSON	, and the thorough sympathy in which Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	holds the original author 's point of view , we may expect the third volume har - moniously as well as adequately to round out this great work .

		The history is on so large a scale that it would seem that its component volumes might well have been brought to more dignified conclusion .

		One turns a page in Vol - ume I. expecting a summing up of the Imperial Roman period , and finds that the end already is reached .

		The last sentence of Volume II. , while it relates to certain architectural orna - mentation , might apply with equal force to the literary form of the history : a great period and a great volume are dismissed with a descrip - tion of trivial detail .

		This may seem hyper - critical , but the work is of such magnitude and of such inherent value that the impression car - ried from it should be commensurate with its dignity , and undoubtedly Mr.
Frothingham	PERSON	will take cognizance of this in the literary structure of the third and last volume of the work -

		An important document from the
Temple Library of Nippur	ORGANIZATION	has been deciphered by Professor
Hilprecht	PERSON	, the indefatigable archaeologist .

		From among the tablets which he has been the means of disinterring and pre - serving , and which are now in the possession of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, he has found one contain - ing a part of the '' Babylon deluge story . ''

		It is the oldest extant written record of that event , antedating the Bible account of the deluge by at least a thousand years , and is about fifteen hundred years older than the similar fragmentary record from the library of Ashnr - banapral .

		The tablet in question is of unbaked clay , measuring nearly three inches in length , somewhat less in width , and seven-eighths of an inch thick .

		Its date is assigned by its discoverer as about two thousand B. C .

		A translation of as much as is decipherable in this ancient document has been made by Professor
Hil	PERSON	- precht .

		It briefly describes the threatened flood , and gives a few general directions for the building of a '' houseboat . ''

		* A novel ten years old is not often remembered at all .

		But those who read `` The Gadfly , '' which was published about that number of years ago , not only remember it but think of it as a singularly impres - sive work .

		The announcement of a new novel by Mrs.
Voynich	PERSON	is therefore calculated to arouse more than usual anticipations , and the statement that this new novel is in some sense a sequel to '' The Gadfly '' is enough to excite the liveliest interest .

		We say '' in some sense '' because the former novel brought the career of its hero to a close , and its successor harks back to an adventurous earlier career that was previously hinted at , but not disclosed .

		In '' An Interrupted Friendship '' we come across him as we accompany a French geographical expedition to the wilds of
South America	LOCATION	; and from the time when , a seemingly hopeless derelict , he becomes attached to the expedition in the character of interpreter , he attracts our attention until he becomes the figure of central importance in a group of which the other members are by no means devoid of interest .

		His enigmatic character , his amazing versatility , and his courage in the face of danger , make the men of his entourage seem almost coloi `` less by comparison , and even the ostensible hero of the narrative recedes into the background .

		Thus far we have outlined some - thing more than half the story ; the lesser portion of it is concerned with the more familiar European scene , and ends with an account , sketched rather than described , of the Gadfly 's career as a French journal - ist , and of his ill-fated share in the movement for the liberation of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The story is intensely vivid from first to last , and grimly tragic as well ; for the author has no mind to deal in sentimental consolations , nor does she invoke the conventional theory of poetic justice .

		An implacable and savage fate wreaks its will upon all the lives that seem best worth saving , and the clouds have no suggestion of a blue sky above them .

		But the book grips us , and , despite all its racking of our emotions , has the fascination of a true * An Interrupted Friendship .

		work of art .

		Such books offer a salutary corrective for the smug self-deception about life that ordinary novels tend to develop .

		Miss
Ethel Stefana Stevens	PERSON	has given us , in '' The Veil , '' an extraordinarily interesting story of the intermingled life of Arab and European in
French North Africa	LOCATION	.

		The scene is
Tunis	LOCATION	, and the European characters are mostly Sicilians .

		The central figures of the book are two natives -- a crafty prophet with the ambition of a
Mahdi	PERSON	, and a beautiful dancing woman , his creature and spy , who fascinates us from beginning to end of the narrative .

		Beside her , indeed , the Sicilian heroine is a colorless creat - ure , although a fair match for the Sicilian hero , who is interesting but hardly inspiring .

		The tale is replete with adventure and rich in romantic color - ing .

		It has , moreover , an historical basis in the
Mohammedan	DATE	uprising which only two years ago sought to wrest the holy city of Kairouan from its infidel possessors .

		u The Rosary , '' by Mrs.
Florence M. Barclay	PERSON	, is not a novel for the trifling reader , nor for the reader desirous of escaping with unwrenched emo - tions .

		The author has created a difficult situation , seemingly piling up obstacles for the satisfaction of overcoming them , and forcing the reluctant attention to become interested in a theme that is almost repel - lant .

		In the first place , she gives us a hero who is a gifted young artist and a worshipper of the beauti - ful , providing for him a heroine who is several years his senior and conspicuously plain of feature .

		Be - neath this exterior , the artist discerns a beauty of soul that makes her the one woman in the world for him , and he woos her with grave passion .

		She , taken all aback by this unexpected assault upon her citadel , is moved to the tenderest affection , but her judgment can not give consent , aud she rejects her lover for what she believes to be his own good .

		Then she journeys abroad , and remains away from
England	LOCATION	until she hears that her suitor has been the victim of an accident which has left him totally blind .

		Following the dictates of her heart , she returns in the hope that she may be helpful ; but the man , still deeply wounded in his pride , and wholly unaware that the woman had loved him all the time , refuses her plea that she may be permitted to come to him .

		She thereupon resorts to the extra - ordinary expedient of getting herself sent to him as his nurse and attendant , and thus , as a supposed stranger , she becomes his intimate companion .

		The deception is successfully carried on for months , and the author contrives to convince us , against our will , of its possibility .

		The task then becomes that of bringing these two high-strung souls , loyal to each other but still more loyal to their ideals , to a true understanding .

		The thing is done , delicately and by slow degrees ; and we work up to an emotional climax that is simply overwhelming .

		It is not often that a novelist grapples successfully with a self - imposed problem so seemingly insoluble , or is able to make tolerable and even beautiful the most intol - erable of all individual calamities .

		THE DIAL 243 has done all this , and in doing it has achieved an artistic triumph far out of the common .


Viscount Mountcastle	PERSON	, son and heir of the
Earl of St. Vian	ORGANIZATION	, becomes engaged , and nearly married , to a girl who loves another man .

		Discovering the facts of the situation in the nick of time , he generously smooths the way for his rival .

		Then he determines to go out into the world as a plain commoner , and find out whether he can find a girl who will love him for his own beaux yeux and manly virtues .

		Possess - ing both , he does not look far .

		He takes quarters in a
Bloomsbury	ORGANIZATION	boarding-house , and there discovers a charming American maiden .

		She is also the child of wealthy parents , and so a pretext has to be devised for her presence in this modest abode .

		He is fortunate in bis first encounters , and rescues her from imminent peril within twenty-four hours of their first acquaintance .

		Then the scene shifts to
Bruges	LOCATION	, whither he follows her , and where he wins her heart by his prowess on the tennis-court , defeating sundry Belgian champions .

		Now is the time for the blow to fall , and it does so with a vengeance .

		An appeal is made to the girl to save her mother 's honor by marrying a
New York	LOCATION	magnate , who holds some compromising letters .

		The daughter tearfully consents , and her lover is left plante-la .

		Thereupon he gets busy , discovers the secret , gets on the trail of the magnate -LRB- then cruising about in his yacht -RRB- , captures the documents by a pretty bit of piracy , and sends them to the girl by registered post .

		The rest may be imagined , and the girl does not balk even when she learns that her lover is one of the proudest peers of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a pleasant tale , crisply told , and without too many agonies ; a trifling tale , but a vastly entertaining one .

		Its title is u The Man Outside , '' and it claims Mr.
Wyndham Martin	PERSON	for its author .

		Mr.
J. Storer Clouston	PERSON	is a fantastic humorist of the type that ''
F. Anstey	PERSON	'' made us acquainted with .

		His gladsome tale of * k The Prodigal Father '' tells us how
James Heriot Walkinshaw	PERSON	,
W.S.	LOCATION	, the crustiest of Scotch solicitors , the very personification of glacial dignity and correctness of bearing , found himself in failing health , and resorted to a practitioner whose methods were justly open to professional sus - picion .

		The treatment given him had for its object the defeat of senescence by a restoration of his tissues to youthful vigor , and it proves so successful that the patient reverses his life , physiologically speaking , and grows younger at an alarming rate .

		As the process goes on .

		his actions become fairly scandalizing -- he goes to
London	LOCATION	and plunges into a wild whirl of dissipation , he flings money right and left , he substitutes directness for circumlocution in his business , he makes love to a buxom widow and then jilts her as too old for him , and he abets the love affairs of his children , to which he had formerly opposed an unyielding front .

		When the story of his downward -LRB- or upward -RRB- career is broken off , he is left in a preparatory school where he stands first in the batting averages .

		Mr.
Clouston	PERSON	tells this story in a vein of dry humor infused with sentiment , and to highly entertaining effect .

		The narrative is rich in incidents , most of which are sur - prising , and displays a keen sense of character despite its fundamentally absurd motive .

		When we first make the acquaintance of
John Ordham	PERSON	, he is an idler in
Munich	LOCATION	, twenty-four years old .

		When we leave him , three or four years later , he bears one of the proudest titles in
England	LOCATION	, owns vast ancestral estates , and is a rapidly rising star in the diplomatic service .

		The external part of this transformation is wrought by the death of his elder brother ; the more significant and spiritual part of it is the gift of tragic experience .

		This is the story told us in `` Tower of Ivory , '' the latest novel by Mrs.
Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	.

		The dea ex machina of Ord - ham ' 8 fate is a woman thirteen years his senior -- the divine artist whose
Brunnhilde	LOCATION	and Isolde have made her the idol of the
Munich	LOCATION	populace , and the favorite of the melancholy King .

		In her earlier days she had been
Peggy Hill	PERSON	of the coal-mines in
America	LOCATION	, and a notorious character in the under - world of
New York	LOCATION	.

		But this is long since past , and we are given to understand that art has so purified and ennobled her that , as
Margarethe Styr	PERSON	, she is wholly worthy of our admiration and of
Ordham	ORGANIZATION	's love .

		The first meeting takes place in no less romantic a spot than
Neuschwanstein	LOCATION	, whither the artist has been commanded by the
King	PERSON	for a midnight recital of his favorite music .

		We may here remark that from this time on discussion of the music-dramas of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	occupies as considerable a part of the book as it does in the ''
Evelyn Innes	PERSON	'' of Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	, fulfilling here also the double purpose of being interesting as criticism and of revealing the character of the heroine .

		Ordham is admitted to intimate friendship with the singer , but their relations are irreproachable , and they do not realize what they have become to each other until separation has led to the self-revelation .

		The separation , in
Ordham	LOCATION	's case , means a return to
England	LOCATION	, and a fall into the trap set for him by an American heiress and the designing relatives on both sides .

		He thinks he is in love , thinks for a time after his marriage that he is happy , and then , when he realizes the contrast between his small-minded , selfish , and hysterical wife , and the true companion of his soul , realizes how fatal a mistake he has made .

		In a mad impulse , he rushes away to
Munich	LOCATION	, to be recalled almost immediately by the news of his wife 's illness and of their still-born child .

		Soon after his wife 's death , the story reaches its tragic denouement when the singer , as the only means of atonement for her own past , and of saving her lover 's career from being ruined by a union with her , makes her last wild appearance as
Brunnhilde	LOCATION	, and turns the self-immolation in the closing scene of '' Die Gstterdammerung '' into an act of grim reality .

		This is the bare outline of a story which has so many of the elements of power that it seems ungrateful to speak of its defects .

		But it must be recorded that Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's style is as stodgy as ever , that her passages of analysis and description are terribly long - winded , that she has hardly the faintest gleam of 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, humor , that her social commentary is too acrid to arouse sympathy , and that the garish coloring of '' Ouida '' is irresistibly suggested by her more am - bitious pages .

		These are pretty serious matters , and they are all aspects of the artistic crudity out of which this strenuous novelist does not seem able to grow .

		Nevertheless , she can be impressive and almost con - vincing at times , perhaps never more nearly convinc - ing than in the present elaborate setting-forth of the play of character under social and artistic pressure .

		The freshness of treatment and the psychological insight which characterize `` The Florentine Frame , '' by Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	, rather more than offset the laxity of its style .

		The book is at least alive with thought , and displays much penetrative obser - vation .

		There are only three characters that count the opulent widow who is set apart from the com - mon herd , not so much by wealth as by aristocratic temperament and refined instincts , her daughter , just budding into womanhood , and the young man who comes from the South to occupy a post in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, and who develops into a dramatist of remarkable gifts .

		He is drawn with some difficulty into the companionship of the two women , becomes an intimate of their household , and benefits spiritually and materially by the association .

		His close rela - tionship with the older woman resolves itself into affection , which would have led to its natural con - summation had it not been for the girl , who imagines herself to be the object of
Keith	PERSON	's worship , and ingenuously reveals to him the fact that he has but to speak .

		The mother , meanwhile , when her eyes are opened , shares in the daughter 's self-deception , suppresses her own desires , and furthers the mar - riage to which reason points as suitable , although it means to her a heart-breaking sacrifice of self .

		This is literally true ; for the wedded couple find their honeymoon brought to a sorrowful end by the news of the mother 's death .

		Then comes the psy - chological climax , for the wife 's intuition discovers the husband 's secret , and she realizes that his heart has never been her own .

		The shock is so severe that it changes the face of life for her , and she is determined upon separation .

		In the end , this emo - tional tension is relaxed ;
Keith	PERSON	's genuine affection for his wife triumphs over her wild resolve , and she becomes reconciled to the life-bond which she has contracted , although the memory of the dead must forever dim the radiance of her romance .

		The title of this appealing tale is symbolical , the Florentine frame being a real frame , kept tenantless for many years by the older woman , because she could not find a portrait quite worthy of such a setting .

		She finds it at last , in the form of a Knight of
Malta	LOCATION	photographed from a famous painting -- a striking anticipation of
Keith	PERSON	's features -- but the symbol is all that destiny has in store for her ; the reality is framed in the heart of the child for whom her great renunciation is made .

		Miss Alice French -LRB- '' Octave Thanet '' -RRB- has taken to problem novels of recent years , and no less a prob - lem than that of the American negro is the theme of '' By Inheritance , '' her latest work .

		But she goes about her delicate task very engagingly , and , although the problem is suggested in her opening chapter , it seems only incidental , and is not brought into the forefront of attention until we have become interested in a situation of the ordinary human sort , and in a group of such characters as the author has described many times before .

		The scheme of her story is based upon the transplantation of Miss
Agatha Danforth	PERSON	from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to
Arkansas	LOCATION	, her errand being that of ministering to the needs of a fever-stricken nephew .

		Miss
Agatha	PERSON	, who is a wealthy spinster , has given much thought to the elevation of the negro race , and is imbued with the traditional
New England	LOCATION	idealism .

		She has known the sophisticated negro , and learned to think well of him , failing to perceive how fundamentally he is set apart in character from the white .

		When she comes to know the negro as the natural man in his
Arkansas	LOCATION	habitat , she suffers numerous severe mental shocks , and becomes slowly but completely disillusionized as the stern facts confront her .

		Much of her former theorizing is discovered to be thin and fantastic , and most of her former efforts are seen to have been misdirected .

		She realizes , among other things , that industrial training is much more needed by the negro than academic education , and that the '' door of hope '' is more likely than not , when opened to him , to lead to an impasse which will prove his ruin .

		Miss French does not pretend to solve the problem of the negro 's future in this country , but she sees clearly certain things about his present status and prospects -- things which nullify many of the aims of well - meaning philanthropy .

		Seeing these things , she does not hesitate to make them clear , and to draw the contrast between plausible theory and unyielding fact .

		There is nothing bitter or prejudiced in her account of the negro ; she appreciates his good quali - ties to the full , and her touch is always generous and sympathetic .

		These remarks have led us away from the book in its aspect as a work of entertaining fic - tion , and we must not close them without reasserting its claim upon the interest of the reader who wishes a story and not a problem .

		He can not quite avoid being made thoughtful now and then , but he is also furnished with a moderately exciting plot , and with the account of many vivid , dramatic , and human happenings .

		There is a homely and wholesome air about the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	novels of Mr.
George Cary Eggleston	PERSON	that makes them welcome to the over-stimulated sense of readers of the kind of fiction now most in vogue .

		They are old-fashioned stories in both matter and manner , straightforward narratives in plain black and white , eschewing subtleties and problems , but developing a sentimental situation with blunt sin - cerity . ''

		Irene of the Mountains '' is a typical example , perhaps a little above the average of its predecessors , and we have read it with genuine satisfaction .

		It is the love-story of an untutored mountain girl and the scion of an old and aristo - cratic family , and the conclusion is happy .

Wayne	PERSON	are the central figures among the men , -- the former a successful captain of industry and willing victim of the delusion of his own moral as well as financial stature , the latter a typical example of the American son of wealthy parents , self-indulgent to the point of drunkenness and a generally reckless course of exist - ence .

		Since this youth is to serve as the hero , he must be invested with some good qualities , and the better self must overcome the worse as his career is unfolded .

		The redeeming influence , of course , must be that of a woman , and a suitable heroine is pro- vided .

		We thus have one of the most conventional and hackneyed of situations , but Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	con - trives to attach to it a sufficient variety of interesting incident , and to develop it with vigor and inventive skill .

		In several instances he has given us real characters -- not symbols or puppets -- and has invested their relations to one another with an un - common degree of human interest .

		We hope that his work will be henceforth continued upon the lines of this energetic new departure .

		When
Cornelis Doris	PERSON	, a landscape painter by the grace of God , permitted a trickster to rob him of his just fame , and claim authorship of his inspired works , he carried self-abnegation considerably beyond the point at which it approves itself to the ethical sense .

		His motive was an overpowering emotion of grati - tude for the trickster 's wife , to whom from earliest childhood he had been bound by the ties of affection .

		It was she who , being several years his senior , had watched over his infancy , had encouraged his child - ish efforts to paint , had seen the artistic possibilities latent in his nature , and had contracted a loveless marriage with a man of wealth for the sole purpose of being able to provide for the training of her pro- tege .

		All this was cause for gratitude , no doubt , but the payment was out of proportion to the debt .

		It is the situation thus described that is developed in '' The Price of
Lis Doris	PERSON	, '' by ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	. ''

		The husband in question is a selfish and malicious person , an amateur of mediocre talents but eager for fame .

		He displays as his own the masterpieces that Lis has painted , and the artist acquiesces in the fraud out of love for his benefactress .

		He agrees , further - more , to abandon landscape for portraiture , and in that field of activity wins distinction and moneyed ease .

		The tragedy of his renunciation wrecks his life , but he keeps the faith , allowing no eyes to see the landscapes which he paints for his own secret delight .

		Even after the death of the man who has cheated him out of his birthright , he feels bound to save the man 's reputation for the sake of the wife and son , and dies directing the destruction of the canvases which would have revealed his secret - It makes a moving and tender story , glowing with exalted feeling , and quivering with the sense of beauty , but its pathos is too unbearable , and one can not justify a sacrifice , however heroically pitched , that involves the perpetuation of so base a fraud .

		After the death of Lis , the truth indeed comes out , but poetic justice requires that it should have come out before .

		The scene of this story is in the author 's own land , a village and country scene for the most part .

		It is delightfully intimate in its depiction of both nature and life , and in its confidential running comment .

		In this latter respect , it reminds us a good deal of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	, who warms us with a similar quality of sunny optimism , and has the same power to bring warm tears to our eyes .

		It is not only the principals in this story who deserve mention , for the writer 's delicate art has drawn for us numerous minor figures that are strikingly indi - vidual -- the gentle and long-suffering dominie , his domineering wife , the '' religious grocer '' who was the hero 's father , the impecunious drawing-master , and several others almost as convincing .

		This is the best book that u
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' has given us for many years .

		whi ch modern science , in the guise of preventive medicine , is making in the tropics against age-long foes of plague and pestilence , and the even more ineradicable enemies , not confined to tropics or barbarians , of superstition , ignorance , and prejudice , is ably told in Sir
Robert Boyce	PERSON	's `` Mosquito or Man '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author is Director of the
Liverpool School of Tropical	ORGANIZATION	Med icine , and as such has shared in and directed numer - ous sanitary expeditions to the fever-ridden coasts of
Africa	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	,
Central America	LOCATION	, and the Amazons .

		There is probably no one who is more familiar with the conquest of the tropics for modern civilization by means of mosquito control , and the prevention of diseases , such as malaria , yellow fever , and sleeping sickness , by the destruction of the insect carriers of their germs , than Dr.
Boyce	PERSON	.

		The book is therefore a capital first-hand authoritative account of actual practice , and not a second-hand compilation , as are most popular books dealing with the subject .

		Pho - tographs of the actual field-work , and copies of police and sanitary regulations , as well as summaries of methods and results , are freely used to illustrate the 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, method and progress of the work .

		The growth of sanitation in the tropics and elsewhere in recent years , and the obstacles of miasm , tradition , and pre - judice , are discussed at length .

		The method of con - duct of an anti-malarial campaign is well elaborated , as are also the preventive measures used against yellow fever .

		Much of the illustrative material for the latter is drawn from the late
New Orleans	LOCATION	cam - paign .

		Sleeping sickness , hookworm disease , goats ' - milk or
Malta	LOCATION	fever , dengue , plague , leprosy , and tuberculosis , are also briefly treated in a popular way .

		The history of the discovery of the secret of malaria , and of insect transmission of its germ , is related but only partially , for no mention is made of the very essential pioneer discoveries of
Grassi	LOCATION	, the Italian zoologist , who shares with Dr.
Ross	PERSON	the honor of the initial discoveries which have brought health to stricken peoples , and are destined ultimately to exterminate certain diseases from all habitable lands .

		Dr.
Boyce	PERSON	has been most generous in ac - cording mention of work in our own land , and in
Cuba	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	; but he seems not to have heard of the American hookworm !

		Doubtless the second edition will relate the progress of the com - paign against this germ of laziness , and will also afford the author an opportunity to eradicate a num - ber of complicated and obscure sentences which mar an otherwise very readable book , and one of great practical interest to all communities where malaria lurks or mosquitos sing .

		Echoes of the 0f books called forth h Y the occur - Darwinian rence of the centennial anniversary centenary .

		f
Darwin	PERSON	's birth , the end appears not even yet to be in sight .

		To the volumes offici - ally issued in connection with both the English and American commemorative ceremonies , Professor
Edward B. Poulton	PERSON	was a contributor .

		By dint of reprinting these addresses , and three others given in connection with the same events but not printed in the official volume , together with an account of the celebration of the
Darwin	PERSON	centenary at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and a few hitherto unpublished
Darwin	PERSON	letters , this author is able to make a
Darwin	PERSON	centenary book , ''
Charles Darwin	PERSON	and the Origin of Species '' -LRB- Long - mans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Poulton	PERSON	is an orthodox Neo-Darwinist of the most extreme and reactionary type .

		With
Wallace	PERSON	, to whom the present volume is dedicated , and
Weismann	PERSON	, he stands as one of the very few who still cling to the fetish of the Allmacht of the cumulative selection of minute variations as the vera causa of evolution .

		All the results of the analytical and experimental study of the problems of evolution , which have made the decade just past the most fruitful of new knowledge and new view - points in this field of biology of any period since
Darwin	PERSON	's own work was done , are to
Poulton	PERSON	of no significance as regards fundamental problems .

		He holds that the `` only fundamental changes in the doctrine -LSB- of evolution -RSB- given to us in
1858	DATE	and
1859	DATE	are those brought about by the researches and the thoughts of
Weismann	PERSON	. ''

		This , fortunately , is an opinion held by but very few people .

		Three of the addresses deal with
Darwin	PERSON	's personality , the develop - ment of his ideas , and historical matters connected with his life .

		Two have to do with an exposition of Mr.
Poulton	PERSON	's well-known views as to the origin and significance of the coloration of butterflies .

		The nineteen letters to Mr.
Roland Trimen	PERSON	, here printed for the first time , form an interesting addition to existing
Darwiniana	PERSON	.

		Full , as were all
Darwin	PERSON	's letters , of the most acute and stimulating observa - tions and opinions on the scientific matters which were under discussion , these also show the extreme modesty , genial and cordial anxiety to help others , and kindly , quiet humor , which appear through his correspondence .

		The following bit is characteristic : '' Many thanks for your Photograph , and I send mine ; but it is a hideous affair -- merely a modi - fied , hardly an improved , Gorilla . ''

		Four appen - dices , dealing with controversial matters , and an excellent index , complete the volume .

		Aspects and Sane and sensible , as a rule , and contrasts of eminently readable always , are Pro- American life .

		f essor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	's occa - sional collections of essays on literary , dramatic , social , or practical themes .

		Nearly half a score of these attractive volumes have now appeared , the latest of which is entitled '' The American of the Future , and Other Essays '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The title essay in this collection of fifteen public addresses and other utterances is an optimistic forecast of our future in respect to our conglomerate but always preponderatingly patriotic population .

		Our ability to assimilate the foreigner is now , as it has been in the past , something remarkable ; and the so-called alien element is proportionately no larger now than it has been for more than a century .

		In a chapter contrasting the Americans and the British , Professor
Matthews	PERSON	calls attention to the Englishman 's '' habit of fighting for his own hand '' which has developed `` a certain hardness , '' an almost frankly brutal manner in word and deed .

		`` The same desire to give pain , '' he remarks , '' is visible in the long his - tory of British literary criticism , from
Gosson	ORGANIZATION	's ' School of Abuse ' to Pope 's ' Dunciad , ' and from the quarterly reviewers of a century ago to the vio - lent vulgarity of the
Saturday	DATE	Review to-day . ''

		Arrogant Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	and urbane
Benjamin Frank	PERSON	- lin , the loudly scornful
Carlyle	PERSON	and the courteous and gentle
Emerson	LOCATION	, are offered as contrasting examples of the British and the American manner of bearing oneself , in life and in letters .

		Good chapters on American humor , the question of the theatre , reform and reformers , standards of success , and a dozen other topics , are to be found in the book .

		As was to be expected , Simplified Spelling comes in for a chapter ; and the author has shown the courage of his convictions , and the indulgence of his publishers , by spelling in his own wild fashion throughout , even when making quotations .

		He has
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 also misspelled the middle name of Mr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	, giving it a superfluous I -- surely not in the interest of simplified spelling .

		On the whole , the hook is rich in thought , and treats of timely topics in a scholarly way .

		Wit not too erudite , and fancy not ™ fo 1 fZh `` r t 00 ™ tous , have joined hands in Professor Grant
Showerman	PERSON	's hook , • • With the Professor '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , and they gracefully trip it as they go , on the light fantastic toe , through three hundred and sixty pages of delightful fooling -LRB- and some seriousness -RRB- .

		Desipere in loco is an art of which this incumbent of a Latin Literature chair proves himself to be a master .

		With a reso - lute determination not to take himself and his col - leagues and his profession too seriously , the author disports himself at the Professor 's expense through twelve sprightly chapters dealing with various aspects of college life and of education in general .

		In the opening essay , '' A Prelude on Pessimism . ''

		he strikes the keynote of the book , a sort of cheerful derision , or gleeful sarcasm , or good-humored pessimism , punctuated -LRB- as the cant phrase puts it -RRB- with all manner of droll conceits , odd quips , and playful sallies .

		But there 's many a serious word said in all this jest ; and it is so well said , with so apt and evidently unstudied employment of classic quotation and neat literary allusion , that the lesson of the book , so far as it has a lesson , is learned without sense of effort or anything but entertainment on the reader 's part .

		Occasionally , in the laudable and admirably successful endeavor to throw off the pro- fessorial manner , the writer goes a little further than necessary in making his style familiar and col - loquial .

		Twice in a single chapter he allows himself to use the barbarism '' enthuse . ''

		Could complai - sance in a finished classical scholar go beyond that ?

		Sometimes , too , he is a bit hackneyed -- as in his definitions of optimist and pessimist : one seeing the doughnut and the other the hole ; one thinking all milk cream , and the other all cream milk , etc. .

		If he had included the heraldic definition of pessimist couchant as one who has lived too long with an optimist rampant , he would have added freshness to his collection .

		Most of these chapters have already passed muster in various magazines , but are still of a breezy quality that revives the fagged brain .

		sours i m mortality is debated by nine eminent authors in a volume entitled '' In After Days : Thoughts on the Future Life '' -LRB- Harper . -RRB-

		The several chapters have already appeared in print , but their collective issue is welcome .

		The manner of treating this engrossing topic falls , in each instance , under one of three general heads .

		Messrs.
Howells	PERSON	and
Higginson	PERSON	and Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	and Mrs.
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward	PERSON	offer consolation to the bereaved , giving warmth and persuasiveness to their words by the introduction of personal experi - ence or personal conviction .

		Messrs.
Henry M. Alden	PERSON	and
Henry James	ORGANIZATION	are philosophical and speculative , as is also
Signor Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	, with the addition of historical and literary illustra - tion and reference .

		Dr.
William Hanna Thomson	PERSON	and Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	enforce their utterances with biblical citations and the vocabulary of devotion , Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	also giving abundant evidence of his strong Swedenborgianism .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, writ - ing at some length , is as tortuous and subtle and little conclusive as his fondest admirers could wish .

		Curi - ously suggestive of his brother 's '' Will to Believe '' is the novelist in the following : '' K one acts from desire quite as one would from belief , it signifies little what name one gives to one 's motive .

		By which term action I mean action of the mind , mean that I can encourage my consciousness to acquire that interest , to live in that elasticity and that afflu - ence , which affect me as symptomatic and auspicious .

		I ca n't do less if I desire , but I should n't be able to do more if I believed . ''

		Each chapter has prefixed the portrait of its author , the volume thus being a valuable collection of photographs of two kinds -- mental and physiognomical .

		Memorial edition The P * 51 ™ 1 f < > U < ™ ™ g Meredith 's of the works of death has naturally been prolific of
George Meredith	ORGANIZATION	.

		^ ^ g -RCB- ^ ^ him .

		Early apprecia - tions have been reprinted , reminiscences and anec - dotes have been recalled ; we have had introductions to his novels , interpretations of his philosophy , analyses of his character-study , of his sense of hu - mor , of his style .

		But as all this is only significant either as preface or incentive to the reading of Meredith himself , so the finest tribute paid him by any publisher is the inception , by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , in connection with his trustees and his English publishers , of a sumptuous '' Memorial Edition '' of his works , to be completed in about twenty-seven volumes .

		Two of these , ' *
Richard Feverel	PERSON	'' and `` The Shaving of Shagpat , '' have already appeared .

		Fine paper -LRB- water-marked with the author 's initials -RRB- , large , clear type , and a plain and dignified binding of silk cloth , characterize the '' Memorial Edition . ''

		A distinctive feature is the illustrations , three or four to a volume , all repro - duced in photogravure .

		These will include scenes associated with the novels and poems , houses where Meredith lived and wrote , several portraits , and reproductions of many of the original illustrations , by
Millais	PERSON	,
Du Maurier	PERSON	, and others , which accom - panied the novels and poems when they were first published in magazine form .

		The principal addi - tions to the text will be the new novel * ' Celt and
Saxon	PERSON	, '' and an unfinished comedy '' The Senti - mentalists '' -LRB- now being played in
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , besides incomplete essays and short stories , and , to the volumes of poems , some unpublished stanzas for u Love in the Valley '' and an early draft of '' The Head of Bran . ''

April 1	DATE	, A collection ^ * s tne sma U Dut significant traits , of literary the less-guarded actions , the involun - anecdotes .

		tar y g estures an -LRB- J acts Q f 8e lf re _ vealment , that most intimately engage our interest in the lives of great men and women .

		The formal biographies we read , and are glad to read , as pre - serving for us the grand outlines of noble and inspiring personalities ; but the anecdotal gleanings of informal biography have a human flavor and a living reality that is often lacking in the studied narrative . ''

		Stories of Authors '' -LRB-
Sturgis &	ORGANIZATION	`` Wal - ton Co. -RRB- , by Professor
Edwin Watts Chubb	PERSON	, is a book designed to appeal to the young student and to the general reader , and to kindle in the breast that spark of literary enthusiasm , of passionate attachment to what is best in the world of books , which the more laborious manuals commonly fail of doing .

		The book contains seventy-one short chap - ters , touching on the characteristics of the great English authors from Chaucer to Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, and of the great American authors from
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	to
Eugene Field	LOCATION	.

		`` Every article , '' says Professor
Chubb	ORGANIZATION	in his preface , '' has been written , selected , or adapted , because of some special value , '' though which of these three methods has been fol - lowed in each instance is not always expressly indi - cated or otherwise made apparent .

		In a certain sense , the plan of the book is better than its execu - tion , inasmuch as the manifest difficulty of finding fresh and entertaining as well as authoritative mat - ter for each chapter has often made it necessary to draw on the standard biographies and reprint what is already more or less familiar to the reading world .

		To the young and little read , however , the volume should prove interesting and stimulating .

		Legends and
Mexico	LOCATION	, with traditions both Indian folk-lore of the and Spanish , both ecclesiastical and
City of Mexico	LOCATION	, political , and with an unusually large class of people among whom folk-tales originate , develop , and are perpetuated , is especially rich in folk-lore .

		Mr.
Thomas A. Janvier	PERSON	has made a valu - able contribution to the treasures of the folk-lorist , in his '' Legends of the City of
Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Harper . -RRB-

		As stories for the general reader , they have been subjected to the experimentum cruris by publication in a popular magazine .

		In their present form , as a contribution to the scientific collection of folk-tales , their value is enhanced by the addition of an intro - ductory chapter and an appendix containing explana - tory notes .

		The legends , as Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	says in his Introduction , have been found , not made , by him ; and he has been exceedingly happy in the manner in which he has presented them to his readers , hav - ing taken them down from the lips of one of the class which is given to the preservation of folk-tales , in the colloquial Mexican-Spanish which is especially fitted to be their medium .

		In his translation of them he has preserved the naivete of the Mexican narra - tor to a remarkable degree .

		To one familiar with the
City of Mexico	LOCATION	, the localization of the various legends give them a still deeper interest .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The
Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just issued a translation of
Francesco Redi	PERSON	's '' Experiments on the Generation of Insects , '' by Miss
Mab Bigelow	PERSON	.

		The work of this Jesuit physician , naturalist , and poet is interesting from the fact that he was one of the first to argue against the popular notion of spontaneous gene - ration .

		The work now translated was published in
1668	DATE	, and it is from the fifth edition -LRB-
1688	DATE	-RRB- that the present translation has been made .

		Mr.
Robert Haven Schauffler	PERSON	's series of anthologies devoted to the days we celebrate now includes a ■
Washington	LOCATION	's Birthday '' volume , made up of essays , poems , stories , and bits of historical characterization suitable for school exercises .

		The real rather than the mythological
Washington	LOCATION	is here delineated -- `` a lov - able , fallible , very human personality , with humor , a hot temper , and a genuine love of pleasure . ''

		Messrs.
Moffat	PERSON	,
Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the volume .

		Mrs.
Florence Jackson Stoddard	PERSON	presents the first collection thus far made of the folk-tales of
Cuba	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	, `` As Old as the Moon '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- In the first division of the book she gives the cosmo-genetic myths of the aborigines ; in the sec - ond , the folk-tales that originated at the time of the advent of the Europeans ; and in a third division , the folk-tales of the slaves of the later days .

		These do not differ materially from similar tales of the Indians under like conditions elsewhere ; and what fascination the book may have for young readers , for whom it seems to be primarily intended , will depend much upon the individual taste .

		But the book will be of value to the student of folk-lore and suggestive of a field for further and closer investigation .

		No matter how many editions of '' The Compleat Angler '' the lover of that ever-verdant classic may have upon his shelves , we can assure him that , if he be a proper Waltonite , he must find a way to possess also the edition recently produced at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	under Mr.
Bruce Rogers	PERSON	's oversight .

		In no other mod - ern setting that we know of has the fresh and quaint flavor of the text been so happily embodied in the typo - graphical arrangement and general form .

		By omitting the supererogatory second part by
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	, it has been possible without sacrifice of large type and liberal mar - gins to bring the volume into pocket dimensions -- surely an important consideration in the case of so `` pocketable '' a classic as the `` Angler . ''

		The wood - cuts of fish in the first edition have been worthily re-engraved by Mr.
Lamont Brown	PERSON	, and there are a few appropriate ornaments and initials .

		Five hundred copies only are offered for sale .

		Every scrap of fact relating in any way to Shake - speare is of interest , especially when it concerns him so intimately as the matter published by Professor
C. W. Wallace	PERSON	in the
March	DATE	'' Harper . ''

		No such light is thrown upon Shakespeare in the pamphlet before us entitled '' Globe Theatre Apparel , '' which Professor
Wallace	PERSON	has privately printed for presentation only ; but it brings
John Hemynges	PERSON	, the business manager of his Company at
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	, and certain members of the
Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	's Company , into the range of our obser - vation .

		The three legal documents that constitute the pamphlet are the papers in a suit brought in
1612	DATE	by Hemynges to recover # 20 from
Joseph Taylor	PERSON	of the
Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	's Company , for players ' apparel the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 latter had got from the former .

		The dreary dulness of these documents gives us some idea of the brain - wearying , heart-breaking labor Professor
Wallace	PERSON	must have done to make his discoveries .

		Eight '' Indian Speeches '' made by Lord
Morley	PERSON	during the past three years are now collected by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	into a volume , to which is appended an important selection of state papers bearing upon the same subject .

		A '' Handbook to the Works of Dante '' is written by Mr.
F. J. Snell	PERSON	, and published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a useful little manual , analyzing the works in some detail , and containing critical and biographical chapters which give us most of the essentials .

		Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	persistently refuses to let the reading public share in the pleasure of seeing his new plays .

		Instead , he will give us this
spring	DATE	a small volume entitled '' Socialism and Superior Brains , '' with a frontispiece portrait of the author taken by himself .

		A literary statistician calls our attention to the fact that out of the three hundred and seventy-five volumes -LRB- excluding translations -RRB- in '' Everyman 's Library , '' thirty-six , or almost ten per cent , are reprints from American authors .

		This is certainly a creditable show - ing for our youthful literature .

		The excellent '' Child 's Guides '' series published by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	has suffered somewhat from the limitations of its title ; the books being in fact not addressed primarily to children but to amateurs and beginners generally .

		A change of title to '' The Guide Series '' has therefore wisely been decided upon .

		The
spring	DATE	announcements of the
Newold Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,

James Redfern Mason	PERSON	; `` The Garden at 19 , '' a novel by Mr.
Edgar Jepson	PERSON	; and a new work of fiction by Mr.
Stanley Portal Hyatt	PERSON	, author of '' The Little Brown Brother . '' ''

		The Shifting and Incidence of Taxation , '' by Pro- fessor
Edwin R. A. Seligman	PERSON	, is now published at the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	in a third edition , consider - ably enlarged and in part rewritten .

		It is eleven years since the original publication of the work , and much fresh material , especially in connection with municipal taxation , and the taxation of instruments of credit , has been provided for the investigator .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons publish a library edition of '' The Autobiography of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, '' which reproduces the work in its unmutilated form , as it was edited and published some thirty years ago by Mr.
John Bigelow	PERSON	, the owner of the original manuscript .

		An interesting introduction tells how the manuscript came into Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's possession . ''

		The Story of Opera , '' by Mr.
E. Markham Lee	PERSON	is a new volume in the '' Music Story '' series , published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		There are many illustrations , includmg examples of musical notation .

		The same publishers , in their '' Makers of British Art '' series , send us a biography of Sir
J. E. Millais	PERSON	, by Mr.
J. Eadie Reid	PERSON	, also with many illustrations . ''

		The Tramp , '' a sixpenny monthly addressed to '' all who are sick of stuffiness in art , life , literature , and magazines , '' has just made its appearance in
London	LOCATION	.

		An interesting miscellany of articles , stories , and verses is contained in the first issue .

		American lovers of the open , as well as their English brethren , should welcome this blithe new-comer in the periodical world .

		The '' American Addresses at the
Second Hague Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, '' as delivered by Messrs.
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	,
Horace Porter	PERSON	, and
James Brown Scott	PERSON	, are now published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for the
Interna	LOCATION	- tional
School of Peace	ORGANIZATION	.

		This volume , dignified in both appearance and contents , is edited by Mr.
Scott	PERSON	, and is a credit to the country , the cause , and the authors .

		The
Marquis de la Mazeliere	ORGANIZATION	's `` Le Japon : Historie et Civilisation '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	:
Plon	LOCATION	-RRB- is now complete in five volumes , the two just received covering the period
1854	DATE	--
1910	DATE	.

		The analytical study of modern
Japan	LOCATION	given us in these concluding volumes is of great value , being both precise in statement and intelligent in dis - cussion .

		The volumes have numerous illustrations .

		Gilder memorial fellowships in
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, for the promoting of the cause of good citizenship and the honoring of an eminent worker in that cause , are to be established if the present endeavor to raise a fund meets with success .

		Research in political and social science will be pursued by the holders of these fel - lowships ; and they will have , as incitement to good work , the memory of a fine example of civic usefulness .

		It is hoped to raise a fund of a hundred thousand dollars .

		A '' Life of
John Brown	PERSON	of
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry , '' by Mr.
Oswald Garrison Villard	PERSON	, one of the editors of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' is announced for early Fall pub - lication by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Villard	PERSON	has devoted years to his task , and has made exhaustive ex - amination of original documents , contemporary letters , and living witnesses , whenever they were to be found , utilizing materials never before drawn upon , and dis - covering others whose existence has heretofore been unknown .

		Among the
Spring publications of Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : `` By The Way : Pleasant Travel Letters with Useful Notes for Tourists , '' by Mrs.

		BRIEFER MENTION 281 NOTES 262 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 282 A VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS .

		Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	occupies a unique posi - tion among our dramatic reviewers .

		For nearly half a century he has been steadily engaged in writing upon the interests of the stage and of the actor 's profession , and his work has been unfailingly characterized by consistency of pur - pose and weightiness of expression .

		He has stood for dignity and self-respect , while his colleagues , in ever-increasing numbers , have deserted to the camp which flaunts the banners of frivolity and servility ; he has defended prin - ciple against opportunism , and art against com - mercialism , with a stout if a saddened heart , amid the evil days and the evil tongues on which he has fallen in his advancing age .

		We have not always been in sympathy with his particular pronouncements , and we think that he has not always displayed the open mind -- that he has found toxic qualities in work that is really tonic ; but we have only unstinted admiration for the steadfastness with which he has upheld the dramatic ideal as he has envisaged it , and only gratitude for his lifelong devotion to the things which are lovely and of good report .

		Self - respect has compelled him to withdraw his ser - vices from the newspaper which for two score years honored itself by engaging them ; but for this material loss he has for compensation the heightened esteem of all those whose approval is best worth having , and the knowledge that he is loved all the more for the enemies he has made .

		Vbi libertas , ibi patria .

		He has refused to wear the shackles of unprincipled journalism , and has won the franchise of the great commonwealth of those who seek and speak the truth .

		Incidentally , he has made himself one of the foremost among American men of letters , a distinction which no time - server can ever hope to attain .

		Nevertheless , when we now hear his clear ringing accents the voice seems as of one crying in the wilderness , so far has the chorus of what passes for dramatic criticism retreated from the position which he now almost single-handed defends .

		The clamor of flippant vulgarity , the chatter that makes novelty its cult , the raucous praise bestowed upon every manifestation of glittering indecency and the sentimental gloss - 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, ing over of vice , now the sounds most prevalent in quarters where things of the stage are dis - cussed , have gone far to drown the voice of this veteran as it puts forth its plea , now old - fashioned enough , for `` joy and temperance and repose '' as the remedies most needed by the diseased body dramaturgic .

		The plea falls upon deaf ears , so far has the theatre-going public gone in its rake 's progress toward an ignoble goal , so dulled has its theatrical sense become from a diet over-seasoned with unwholesome condiments .

		Our text for these remarks is afforded by an article contributed to ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' in which Mr.
Winter	PERSON	falls foul of the
New York Theatrical Syndicate	ORGANIZATION	and its off endings .

		He is prompted to this deliverance by a defence of that organization undertaken by Mr.
Charles Frohman	PERSON	in a metropolitan newspaper .

		Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	has some good things to his credit , and is not personally answerable for all the sins of the Syndicate ; but in standing as the apologist for most of its unconscionable proceedings , he makes himself a fair object for attack .

		After all , the man who could decide upon such an artistic outrage as that of presenting a woman , no matter how estimable and accomplished , and a diminutive woman at that , in the titular role of '' Chantecleer , '' lays himself open to the im - putation that he is capable de tout , like the prophet
Habakkuk	LOCATION	in
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's witty saying .

		And since he defends the methods of the
Syndi	PERSON	- cate , it is not improper , for the purpose of the argument , to lay them upon his shoulders .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	finds no difficulty in crushing '' the most active and influential of contemporary theatrical managers '' beneath the weight of his own admissions and sophistical reasonings .

		The claim that
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' more than four hundred years ago , '' was the originator of the theatrical '' trust , '' offers a good opening ; and the critic could not have asked a better text to go on with than is found in the following ingenuous words of Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	: '' My impression was that within very recent years several men united to systematize the conduct of the theatre , put the actor 's profession on a self-respecting footing , guard the playwright against piracy , protect the managers of theatrical companies against unfair competion , at the same time obliging them to keep faith with managers of theatres . ''

		Several vulnerable points are noticeable in this statement , and Mr.
Winter	PERSON	puts his finger upon all of them .

		The impudent plea that one of the aims of the Syndicate is to '' put the actor 's profession on a self-respecting footing '' arouses his hottest indignation , and he draws upon his extensive knowledge of theatrical history in
America	LOCATION	to expose the hollow pretence of such an assumption .

		It seems quite clear , on the whole , that we had self-respecting actors before the days of the palmy present had dawned ; and the numerous modern instances of trickery and coercion which are adduced seem to indicate that Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	's notions of what constitutes self-respect are curiously inverted .

		The pretence that the
Syndicate	ORGANIZATION	provides a safeguard against unfair competition is almost equally hollow and hypocritical .

		One thinks of Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	playing in circus tents , and Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	in shabby second-rate houses , be - cause they refused to submit to the insolent dictation of the monopolists .

		One thinks of the boycotting tactics practised upon
Augustin Daly	PERSON	because he rebelled against the tyranny of the '' closed shop . ''

		One thinks of the bull - dozing policy which has marked such men as Mr.
Mantell	PERSON	and Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	and Mr.
Faver	PERSON	- sham for its victims .

		One thinks of the exclusion from the Syndicate theatres of a critic like Mr.
Metcalfe	PERSON	, and of the deposition from his critical post of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	himself , for no other offence than that of daring to speak the truth and of maintaining the right of independent judgment .

		No , the theory of fair and free competition is not even specious ; no man knows better than its hypocritical proponent that '' the Syndicate is a despotic , arrogant monopoly , organized and conducted for the one purpose , and no other , of ` cornering the market ' in theatrical affairs , and gathering wealth for the few speculators who have combined to batten on what they call public amusements . ''

		In the matter of the recent flooding of our stage by the sewage of vulgarity and indecency , Mr.
Frohman	PERSON	has nothing less feeble to urge than the plea that '' what the public wants is what they ought to have . ''

		We have recently discussed this subject on our own account , and would gladly re-state , did space permit , using Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's own words of indignant repu - diation , the only view of the matter that has anything to do with ethical principle .

		Our critic 's reductio ad absurdum of the shameful proposition is elaborate , vigorous , and pictur - esque .

		In more general terms , the only belief possible to a man who does not flout the very idea of the individual 's responsibility for his acts is formulated by Mr.
Winter	PERSON	in a statement that could not well be finer or more impressive . ''

		When a man assumes to employ any one of the fine arts as a means of ' doing business , ' he is , likewise , undertaking -- whether he knows it or not , and whether
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 he intends it or not -- to mould and guide the public taste , to influence the direction of the public thought , and to affect the condition of the public morals : ac - cordingly , such a man therein assumes a responsibility much higher , much more serious , than that which is incurred in the adoption of any strictly and exclusively business pursuit : and , while the obligations of honor and honesty rest with equal weight upon all workers , in all branches of human industry , those obligations are inex - orable and peculiarly sacred in the ministration of intellectual , moral , and spiritual forces .

		It is one thing to deal in dry-goods and groceries ; it is another and vastly different thing to deal in the dissemination of thoughts and feelings . ''

		Turning back to our
Ruskin	PERSON	, we find the same doctrine expounded with the same earnest con - viction : u It is physically impossible for a well - educated , intelligent , or brave man to make money the chief object of his thoughts . ''

		With all such men '' their work is first , their fee sec - ond -- very important always , but still second . ''

		Our theatrical interests can never be safe unless they are in the hands of men who are prepared to accept this principle with all its implications .

		OSCAR WILDE 'S PLACE IN LITERATURE .

		After a decade of noisy oblivion , the writings of Oscar Wilde have received the recognition of a definitive edition , worthy as to form and complete in contents .

		* No longer need we contend with the pornographic stock-broker at the book-auction , or shake our heads over the excessive prices of items listed in the catalogues under the dreadful caption of
Oscariana	LOCATION	.

		However , no one but the collector will complain that
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	is no longer a rarity .

		Now at last we can fight in the light : we may '' adopt an attitude , '' to use a phrase of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's own , toward a definitely presented literary talent ; and even the apologists who plead that
Villon	PERSON	was a rascal and Shakespeare a poacher , may judge whether or not we shall forget that the '' apostle of the English Renaissance '' was an improper person .

		Will Wilde survive ?

		The answer lies in these substantial volumes ; the evidence is all in , though it may be over-early to discuss it .

		What strikes one first is the range of the writings : there are plays , novels , poems , essays , art-criticism , book - * This edition was planned and published some two years ago by the English firm of
Methuen & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		with the authori - zation and cooperation of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's literary executor , Mr.
Robert Ross	PERSON	.

		The set comprised fourteen volumes , beauti - fully printed on hand-made paper , the edition being limited to a thousand copies .

		Bv arrangement with the English publishers .

		Messrs.
John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	have used the plates of this edition for an American reprint , much less expensive in price , but naturally also less attractive in paper , presswork , and binding .

		Besides their limited idition de luxe , referred to above .

		Messrs.
Methuen	LOCATION	have within the past few months completed a popular-priced library edition of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's works , printed from new plates , and issued in twelve volumes ; this , however , does not contain all of the matter presented in the limited edition .

		reviews , and autobiography ; nothing is lacking but history and the '' miscellaneous divinity '' of the old - book stores !

		Wilde preferred making history to writing it -LRB- we are still trying to forget the lily ! -RRB-

		; and if he worshipped
Pater	PERSON	's style , he did not care in the least for patristic literature .

		Here , therefore , we must content ourselves with the Pre-Raphaelite lyrics , filled with aesthetic religiosity as the poems of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	: charming decorative pieces surely , but insincere in spirit as most of our modern cathedral glass .

		Mediaeval feeling , after aU , can hardly be reproduced in a copy of a copy .

		Rossetti is but one of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's literary models ; every great poet of the Victorian age finds a second immortality in his verses .

		They pass before us in '' The Garden of Eros '' --
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, Swin - burne ,
Morris	PERSON	, and the poet-painter himself .

		But if we add to these self-confessed mentors most of the other great English poets , and to these Homer and the Greeks , and
Dante	PERSON	, and a few of the lyrists of
France	LOCATION	, we shall get a better idea of the range of his reading and the strength of his memory .

		No academic ear is needed to detect this ; echo follows echo as in a musical comedy . ''

		The true artist is known , '' said
Wilde	PERSON	in one of his reviews , '' by the use he makes of what he annexes ; and he annexes everything . ''

		So our poet modestly lived up to his maxim , aware that in literature at least there is no
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Had not
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	said , before him , '' Je prends mon bien ou je le trouve '' ?

		Like Moliere , we are all plagiarists -- though hardly , per - haps , with such an excuse ; and some Elysian day , when all but the scholars have ceased to read the classics , judicious plagiarism may become a literary virtue , supported by a socialistic culture and justified by the pedagogic theories of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		So perhaps might Wilde have justified his imita - tions .

		But his plagiarism was of the old-fashioned sturdier sort , like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's or
Moliere 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		He copied from other poets , hoping , as all plagiarists hope , that in the course of time others might copy him .

		He copied himself , to show that he was not unworthy of the compliment .

		Did not Homer re - peat his adjectives , his similes ?

		So in these books the best refuses to be hidden , and telling epithets , aphorisms , and puns reappear like comets in the cosmic life .

		Over a score of the epigrams in `` A Woman of No Importance '' are taken from '' Dorian Gray . ''

		Like the bird in
Browning	PERSON	's verses , Wilde '' Sings each song twice over , Lest you should think he never could recapture The first fine careless rapture . ''

		One can not see how much of the early verse can survive .

		We soon tire of hydromel , and a Keats devoid of genius becomes the most dreadful of lit - erary diets .

		Alas for
Wilde !	ORGANIZATION

		he feasted too long on ambrosia , and drank too deeply of his `` poppy - seeded wine . ''

		To read his verse at all is cloying , and to read much of it is like a literary debauch .

		The best things are the Sonnets , in which the imagery is definitely limited by the form : there at least the reader is sure of one thought for every 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, fourteen lines .

		Next to these come , not the '' Pagan '' verses , far too morbidly romantic to be Greek , but the pastel-like pictures inspired by
Gautier	PERSON	, some of which have all the delicate impressionism of Emaux et CamSes .

		What could be better in its way than this : `` la fuite db la lune . ''

		To outer senses there is peace , A dreamy peace on either hand , Deep silence in the shadowy land , Deep silence where the shadows cease . ''

		Save for a cry that echoes shrill From some lone bird disconsolate ; A corncrake calling to its mate ; The answer from the misty hill . ''

		And suddenly the moon withdraws Her sickle from the lightening skies , And to her sombre cavern flies , Wrapped in a veil of yellow gauze . ''

		No minor poet in
England	LOCATION	ever attained a more thorough mastery of technique than Wilde : we see it in the sonnets , as nearly perfect in construction as the study of Milton could make them ; we see it pushed to the extreme of I ` art pour I ` art in that bit of Byzantine mosaic , '' The Sphinx . ''

		Yet of these early poems none are to be found in the anthologies save `` Ave Imperatrix , '' which alone catches a breath of national feeling in an adequate chord .

		Most of them , to be sure , are esoteric ; when we read them we wonder what is the matter , but when we have read them we conclude that there is n't any .

		Never did Wilde conform more closely to his maxim , '' Youth is rarely original . '' ''

		The Ballad of Reading Gaol '' was written fifteen years later .

		We all remember how it was re - ceived ; we remember -- alas !

		-- how it was compared to '' The Ancient Mariner . ''

		Such judgments show the evils of literary journalism : they indicate that the critic has had no time to read
Coleridge	PERSON	since his college days . ''

		Reading Gaol '' has more limp - leather editions to its credit in the department stores , -- but where in
Wilde	LOCATION	's ballad do we find anything like the conception , the imaginative power , and the classic simplicity of '' The Ancient Mariner , '' whose every sentence is as full of meaning as the etcher 's line ? ''

		Reading Gaol '' does recall
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , as '' Charmides '' recalls something of Keats ; but the first poem is too brutal , the second too deli - cately indelicate , to carry out the comparison invited by occasional imitative lines .

		No realism , however poignant , can match the serene imaginative reality of the earlier poem ; we want no paradoxes in the ballad , we want no ballad so artistic as to be artificial .

		And , after all , Wilde never forgets that the important thing in his poem is the manner .

		The tyranny of technique is
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's real prison - wall .

		If art is not able to efface itself -- ars est celare artem -- better to write without regard for style than use the diction of '' The Decay of Lying . ''

		Such prose makes one think that it is possible for an artist to be too articulate .

		`` The world was created , '' said
Stephane Mallarme	PERSON	' , '' in order to lead up to a fine book . ''

		For
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, apparently , the cosmic processes led up to the paradox .

		`` Pen , Pencil , and Poison '' was built around an epigram , and '' The Model Millionaire '' was written for the sake of a pun . ''

		Paradoxy is my doxy '' is the basis of his artistic creed ; and the principle of his method is simple contrariety .

		For example : '' After the death of her third husband her hair turned quite gold from grief . '' ''

		We live in an age that reads too much to be wise , and thinks too much to be beautiful . ''

		What could be simpler than the modus operandi ?

		Yet each of these phrases occurs three times in the volumes before us , with many another gem of rare and recurrent wit .

		Surely
Wilde	PERSON	knew that the best of paradoxes will scarce bear repetition , and that the wittiest of epigrams loses its flavor when it becomes a refrain .

		The least affected of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's prose is to be found in the journalistic criticism which fills a volume and a half of the collected works ; book-reviews of purely ephemeral interest , yet written with sprightly grace and wit , and full of literary judgments which will be turned against their author -- when our would-be doctors fall upon the difference between
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's preaching and his practice !

		And to reward their la - bors , they will find some charming '' purple patches '' ; the best of these were afterwards worked into the pages of '' Intentions . ''

		Wilde might have become a critic of importance , had it been given him to out - grow his paradoxes and to chasten his style .

		He had a nice appreciation of all the arts , and a sense of the melodic possibilities of language that puts his best work beside that of Pater ; and , unlike
Pater	PERSON	, he never falls from music to mosaic .

		Truly , '' Intentions '' is a delightful book , -- but how far below
Pater	LOCATION	, if we consider it as a collection of essays !

		How far below Landor in its management of the dialogue form !

		Wilde 's adversary is always the man of straw ; there is none of the play of personality , the contrast of opposite standpoints , that we find in such books as Mallock 's '' New Republic . ''

		Wilde could not project himself into the intellectual life of another .

		This is the fault of all his work .

		The very types in his plays , excepting those that call for a mere surface characterization , are at heart merely dra - matic phases of the moods or poses of their author .

		He gives them emotions , but not minds or characters ; he makes them real by their repartee .

		They are puppets animated by puns ; they bedazzle our judg - ment with a pyrotechnic shower of epigrams .

		We are carried away by it all , but we are left nothing which we can carry away .

		The aesthetic `` katharsis '' of his dramatic theories is lost sight of ; we must purge our souls with paradoxes , and in improper situations make them clean .

		After all , the charac - ters of these plays are not characters , for all they have the tone of good society .

		They are sometimes society men and women , but more often only marion - ettes with manners .

		Marionettes , too , are the men and women of '' Dorian Gray . ''

		Lord
Henry Wotton	PERSON	, brilliant ,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 autobiographic , the monocled Mephisto of an inef - fectual
Faust	LOCATION	, may alone be said to live , and at times tbe reader finds him more lively than alive .

		Dorian simply does n't exist ; he has sold his con - science for an eternal youth , -- and what man can exist without a conscience ?


Sybil Vane	PERSON	is a shadow , and the painter
Hallward	PERSON	the shadow of a shade .

		He is never so living as when he is slain , and his corpse sits sprawling in the dreadful attic .

		Only a few of the minor characters , sketched in , like the unctuous Jew of the theatre , with broad realistic touches , may be said to live even as properties .

		No , '' Dorian Gray '' is a good subject spoiled .

		One can imagine how Flaubert would have told the story , how Balzac would have filled it with fiery - colored life .

		Yet some have compared this novel to La Peati de Chagrin !

		The shorter stories need not detain us ; they are less real than the fairy-tales .

		We turn with pleasure to '' The Happy Prince '' and '' The House of Pomegranates , '' -- for the luxuriance that cloys in the poems becomes delightful when submitted to the partial restraint of a poetic prose .

		No one , of course , would go to
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	for the trenchant simplicity of the German folk-tale .

		His are merely artistic apologues , touching life with the light satire of the drawing-room .

		One forgets their author , excepting when he is sticking pins into his puppets to create an artistic pathos ; only then do we rebel .

		However ,
Wilde	PERSON	did not take his heroes seriously , nor need we .

		Let us be thankful that he does not , that he drags in no pompous moral , for without it these fables have all the honesty of the frankly artificial , and in their very slightness of texture lies the secret of their charm .

		The case is the same with the plays .

		The best of the comedies have a sort of frivolous unity ; they are often terribly affected , but they never affect a moral .

		Sincerity makes
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	inconsistent with his art ; he becomes impossible when he assumes a pur - pose , and intolerable when he has a paradox to prove .

		Could anything be worse than the essay on Socialism ?

		But no problems spoil his plays , and when we find that the least serious of them is incomparably the best , the inference is easy .

		He felt too much the charm of his material ; he found it easier to play with constructions than to construct a play .

		As a follower of Vart pour 1 ` art , a purpose would spoil him , and he admitted sincerity only in his attitude toward aesthetics .

		Yet the value of a fundamental seriousness is nowhere more apparent than in the superiority of his art-lectures to such work as '' Pen , Pencil , and Poison . ''

		The final necessity of subduing style and spirit in a deeper unity is shown in '' De Profundis . ''

		Reading Gaol , and not
Oxford	LOCATION	, gave us the final development of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's prose .

		It is said that prisons make men liars ; but it was none the less a prison that made '' De Profundis '' sincere .

		Here first his art attains its final unity , -- a unity of spirit and form which puts certain pages of his confession almost beyond criticism .

		All of his early work , in comparison , seems little more than a promise ; for here alone he attains the simplicity of great art .

		When we add to this its value as a '' document , '' we can not doubt that `` De Profundis '' will survive .

		It is a pity that this is all we can be sure of .

		But '' The Ballad of Reading Gaol '' contains too much alloy ; if it becomes a classic our classics will have lived .

		The art-criticism , the aesthetic '' philosophy , '' will be stolen and rewritten , as it was originally stolen and rewritten by
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		The life of the plays is limited by the life of their paradoxes , as we can see from the puns in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	; and even the fairy tales need more human nature to keep them alive .

		Wilde 's place in literature , in so far as he concerns us , is that of a precursor : he prepared the way for
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's paradoxes , and the success of
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	is to be laid at his door .

		He revealed to us a certain kind of wit , but he has made some of our critics tre - mendously trifling .

		Everything considered ,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's literary executors would have done better to give us a selection from his works -- a careful selection , with all the cheapest epigrams expunged .

		Not even a reviewer can read a dozen volumes of this sort with impunity

London	LOCATION	, of course , is a great literary centre ; but in proportion to its immense population it is a small book-buyer .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	affirmed that the high road to
England	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	was the fairest sight a Scotchman could look upon ; but the road leading from
England	LOCATION	to
Scotland	LOCATION	is now one of the fairest to the view of an Englishman with books to sell .

		For no country of so small a population and so modest resources equals
Scotland	LOCATION	as a book-buyer .

		It is claimed , indeed , that she buys and reads more books per capita than any other country , '' not even excepting
America	LOCATION	'' -- a country that is confessedly very self-denying in the purchase of books . ''

		Just walk along famous Princes Street of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, '' proceeds our authority , '' and notice the number of bright , busy book-shops .

		Every other person you meet is carrying a book to or from one of those shops and libraries , and the whole sight is grateful and comforting . ''

		And it is the best books , too , that the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	folk buy , with a pardonable prefer - ence for her own famous sons , such as
Scott	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	. ''

		The third old university town of Scot - 264 THE DIAL L
April 16	DATE	, land ,
Aberdeen	LOCATION	, buys books with every penny she can spare ; for up there literature is pursued even if it has to be on a little oatmeal ... Book-buying is part and parcel of the economy of a Scottish household , and be they ever so poor Scottish people are educated .

		They have been for centuries , which is what makes
Scotland	LOCATION	literary , and , the Scots would probably declare , liberal in politics , meaning progressive . ''

		It is certainly in accordance with the fitness of things that the best books should find their best market in the country that has produced one of the greatest British poets , the greatest British romancer , and the most forceful and original of British prose-writers .

		• • • The poetic inspiration of the simple life , as contrasted with the thronging and often unwhole - some suggestions of modern metropolitan existence , is hardly open to serious dispute .

		The question whether poets have themselves generally preferred to live the simple life as well as to sing it , is not quite so easy to decide .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' the English poet laureate , and Mr.
Clement K. Shorter	PERSON	, editor of '' The Sphere , '' have recently been engaged in a newspaper debate of this question .

		`` The Times , '' in a well-written editorial on '' The Fiction of the Simple Life , '' provoked the discussion , by venturing to affirm that despite all the pretty things said of the country by the poets , most of the poets have been only too glad to enjoy the comforts and amusements of urban life ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	standing out as a conspicuous exception .

		Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	made a vigorous rejoinder to this , but based his argument chiefly on the many and undisputed references in the poets to things rural and pastoral . ''

		The Times '' replied , and Mr.
Shorter	PERSON	also wrote to that journal a letter of vehement dissent from Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's opin - ions , saying truly that u it is not so much a question of what poets have written about the simple country life as of how far they have cared to endure it . ''

		Attention might be called also to the queer procliv - ity of literary persons to write , or at least to wish to write , about what they know nothing of from experience .

		The most entrancing stories of domestic bliss are often written by unmarried or unhappily - married men and women ; the hall-bedroom boarder contributes society gossip and notes on the doings of the Four Hundred to the daily newspaper ; and tales of horror and carnage and awful crime come from the pens of timid maidens and pale-faced young men .

		The passing of a noted naturalist and a distinguished contributor to the literature of natural science is noted with regret in the sudden death ,
March 28	DATE	, of Professor
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	, at the age of seventy-five .

		Gifted son of a gifted father , he shone not only as an original investigator in that father 's domain of science , but also as a mining engineer and a remarkably able man of business .

		His work at
Harvard	LOCATION	, where he stepped into
Louis Agassiz	PERSON	's shoes without getting lost in them , and where he built up a great museum of comparative zoology and made the university his pecuniary debtor to the extent of half
a million dollars	MONEY	, is well known .

		His success as superintendent and then president of the Calumet and
Hecla	ORGANIZATION	mines is to be read in the astonishing rise of Calumet and
Hecla	ORGANIZATION	stock from next to nothing until it is now quoted at
six hundred dollars	MONEY	a share .

		The elder
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	used to declare , when invited to turn his scientific knowledge to his own and others ' pecuniary account , that he had no time to waste in money-making .

		The son found time to make money and to spend it beneficently , besides continuing his special re - searches in his favorite branches of science .

		His original and unostentatious ways of giving were in marked contrast with the methods pursued by some other public benefactors .

		When , six years ago , he was offered
$ 75,000	MONEY	for conducting some deep - sea soundings in the
Pacific	LOCATION	, on condition that the enterprise should be known as the
Carnegie	LOCATION	-
Agassiz Expedition	ORGANIZATION	, he promptly declined the offer and found money elsewhere -- chiefly in his own pocket .

		The life of such a man is full of inspiration to others ; and it is to be hoped that a worthy biog - raphy of
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	may in due time be forthcoming .

		A master of sane thinking , and a living expo - nent of that rational conduct that grows naturally and inevitably out of such modes of thought , has passed away with the death , early this month , of Professor
Borden Parker Bowne	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	Uni - versity .

		With a sure perception of things funda - mental and essential , and an impatience with all that is in the nature of superfluous ornament , Dr.
Bowne	PERSON	was a power in the lecture-room and also a deeply impressive and strongly convincing writer .

		His numerous writings on philosophical and theistic subjects have had a reading not confined to English - speaking lands , some of his works having enjoyed the distinction of translation into other tongues . ''

		The Philosophy of Theism '' and '' The Immanence of God '' may be mentioned as among his best-known works .

		What was perhaps his last published utter - ance , `` The Present Status of the Argument for Life after Death , '' in the
January	DATE	'' North American Review , '' was remarkable for its scholarly clearness and its combined hopefulness of outlook and sober restraint .

		Probably no one of his books ever attained a large circulation , but he had appreciative readers who will lament his death in what may be regarded as the very prime © f an intellectual worker 's life .

		He was but little over sixty-three when he died .

		A great general `` meeting-house , '' in even more than the old
New England	LOCATION	sense of that word , is advo - cated ; and it would be devoted to the welfare of the people at large , of whatever denomination , and to the promotion of all sorts of good works .

		THE CHARM OF
MRS. HUMPHRY	PERSON	WARD 'S NOVELS -LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		I have just been reading in your issue of
April 1	DATE	the remarks of Professor
E. E. Hale	PERSON	, Jr. , on Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, in his review of Professor
Phelps	PERSON	's recent book of '' Essays on Modern Novelists . ''

		One may agree with Professor
Hale	PERSON	's main contention , and yet think him rather wide of the mark when he makes technique account for the vogue of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	.

		The immediate hold of her novel may , it is true , be dependent upon the skill with which she puts together her story ; but , although I am no great admirer of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, I find that what holds me to her books , even over considerable 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, sandy tracts , is the desire to discover what is coming next .

		Yet although this might lead one to read one of her stories to the end , it would not account for the desire to take up another .

		For that kind of interest , we must look to the substance of the story .

		And I think in this matter the common judgment is to be trusted .

		To put the matter briefly , it seems to me that what Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has for us is a sort of gentlewomanly morbidity that suits a large public in these days of analysis and psychology .

		Book after book exhibits this characteristic , as life is disclosed , first in one aspect , then in another , -- through
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	in the field of religion ;
Marcella	PERSON	in the field of politics and toil ;
William Ashe	PERSON	in a study of politics and the family ;
Diana	PERSON	and Lady Rose in the workings of heredity and environment .

		This gentlewomanly morbidity involves , it seems to me , both the material of melodrama and the method of analysis .

		The melodrama explains the story interest , the analysis the feeling of self-approval with which the would-be serious-minded readers excuse their indulgence in fiction .

		Only one of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's novels -LRB- I have not read them all , and have really studied none , so that my judgment is of the impres - sionistic sort -RRB- leaves with me the sense of vital passion -- ''
David Grieve	PERSON	'' ; and one , '' Sir
George Tressady	PERSON	, '' is so flagrantly melodramatic in its conclusion that it has failed , I believe , of the popularity that has attended the others .

		At least I have never heard the book com - mended .

		The popularity of '' Eleanor '' I do not find accounted for by the explanation given above ; at least to me the analysis was so in excess of the story that after a few chapters I was put to sleep and never woke up to resume the story and find out what happened .

		`` WHO 'S WHO IN THE WORLD . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		There is no question that there is a place for a bio - graphical dictionary which will give in one volume concise information about the living notables in all the leading nations of the globe .

		The original English '' Who 's Who '' pretends to an international character ; but it is only a pretense , and a very flimsy one .

		Since this lack is felt , it is unfortunate that the publication which has just appeared in
London	LOCATION	, under the editorship of a gen - tleman with the highly floral appellation of
Hyacinthe Ringrose	PERSON	, fails so signally to supply the need .

		The '' International Who 's Who '' seems to have had an immense deal of trouble getting itself issued Its compiler set out to employ a very easy and effective method , -- namely , to cull a list of biographies from the English '' Who 's Who , '' the pioneer of all ; the French `` Qui Etes-Vous ? ''

		the German '' Wer Ist 's , '' the `` Italian `` Chi E ? ''

		and our own `` Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		He was so indiscreet , however , as to men - tion in a circular letter , sent out in order to collect information , that he intended to use data published by these other works ; and his forgetfulness of the fact that the national volumes were protected by copyright brought down upon his head -- from the American publishers at least -- such a volley of commination as convinced him of the necessity of finding a different method .

		Checked by the threat of prosecution for infringe - ment of copyright , the enterprising
London	LOCATION	editor at once dispatched another circular letter , informing the notables that each must send him a complete biogra - phical statement couched in different language from that employed in the American volume .

		But the notables were annoyed . ''

		Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' is a responsible and influential publication , and its fulmina - tions had had their effect .

		A large number of the Americans addressed failed to respond , especially as the request was accompanied by a very frank assur - ance that a remittance of five dollars must be forth - coming in order to secure mention .

		The worst feature of the English compiler 's method is that the eagerness of response is in exactly inverse proportion to the real importance of him who is to respond .

		Mr.
Job Johnson of Turkey Center	ORGANIZATION	is very ready to exchange a five-dollar bill for a scrap of biography ; but Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	does not rate a scrap of biography so highly .

		Thus it comes about that the name of
William Dean Howells	PERSON	does not appear in the '' International Who 's Who , '' but that
Job Johnson of Turkey Center	ORGANIZATION	is there in all his glory .

		Aside from its defects of method , the work is unfor - tunate in execution .

		The proof-reading is execrable .

		Some of the notables will never recognize their names .

		Dozens of Americans will find the city of their residence given , but the state omitted .

		The French section is a chaos of misplaced or omitted accents and meaningless jumbles of letters ; and the German and Italian sections are scarcely more accurate .

		One might venture the guess that the whole volume was corrected by an English reader with no language but English and a very limited knowledge of geography .

		The biographies seem to have been printed in just the helter-skelter , loquacious fashion in which the subjects sent them in ; so that no two give exactly the same sort of information .

		There is no at - tempt at a table of contents or an alphabetical index ; and as some of the names occur in most unexpected sur - roundings , there is no way of telling whether a name is there except by looking through the entire volume for it .

		The book , in short , is little more than worthless in its present form .

		It is to be hoped that the editor and publishers may find a more practicable working method for completing what might prove to be a useful volume , or that some one else may take up the task and do what they have failed to do .

		DESCENDANTS OF THE POET KEATS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In a paragraph in your last issue , on a gathering of the descendants of great poets in
London	LOCATION	this week , the statement is made that '' the name of Keats seems to have vanished as though it had , in very truth , been • writ in water . ' ''

		While it is true that there are no living descendants of the poet
Keats	PERSON	, yet several of his distant relatives , grandchildren and great-grandchildren of his brother George , are living in

		Fifty Years of
Xew Japan	LOCATION	.

		1 Between the supposed commercial interests of the American people and their more unself - ish ideas and feelings there is a startling dif - ference .

		While the men interested in selling their steel , pork , and other things called for in war contracts at Government prices , are busily engaged in planning war with
Japan	LOCATION	, there is on the other side of the water a disposition to turn the other cheek , as far as it is possible to do so without dishonor .

		Nevertheless , it is generally supposed that the Christians live on this side of the
Pacific !	LOCATION

		If Americans could pay a little less attention to getting up hysteri - cal fears of a military invasion of our western shores , and give more study to the real purpose of the modern Japanese , there would be less talk about building steel castles that cost more than university foundations .

		Then the '' valor of ignorance '' would take on a new significance .

		Those who have known
Japan	LOCATION	best and longest realize that her one purpose and her chief problem is peaceful development .

		Hers is the desire , first , to provide food for her in - , creasing millions : and then to compel
China	LOCATION	to reform and become modern , and thus to arouse all
Asia	LOCATION	to progress .

		Count
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	, in this great book , of which he is the master spirit , expresses this idea clearly . ''

		We desire by the cooperation of our Anglo-Saxon friends to en - gage in the glorious humanitarian work of civi - lizing and developing two Oriental nations -LSB-

		To do this ,

		From vital necessity * , she is as much interested in

Okuma	ORGANIZATION	in
Japan	LOCATION	forty years ago , as also the young men who were connected with him in forming the new government , knows that this ambition of the Japanese is no new thing , and that any feeling of innate hostility to Americans is purely imaginary -- about as unthinkable as the ingratitude of Japanese children to their parents .

		The spirit of gratitude and acknowl - edgment of obligation to Americans breathes throughout this book .

		Count
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	was himself a pupil of the American missionary
Verbeck	PERSON	, who was the great trainer of Japanese statesmen ; while many of the younger men in public life were taught by those of us Americans who were pioneers of the secular education , which in
Japan	LOCATION	was founded on American prin - ciples and methods .

		Like the resourceful housekeeper ,
Count Okuma	ORGANIZATION	brings forth from the national storehouse things old and new .

		He brings into cooperation men who a generation ago were young like him - self and strenuous in bringing in the new world of ideas .

		As a matter of fact , nearly all the men who created the new government of
1868	DATE	were under thirty-five , and numbered scarcely more than fifty .

		Out of this original company he has secured as contributors for his monumental history his comrades Count Soyeshima , Prince
Ito	PERSON	,
Prince Yamagata	LOCATION	, Admiral
Yamamoto	PERSON	, and others of `` the old guard . ''

		He has even -- he himself being the interviewer -- secured a chap - ter of testimony from the last
Shogun	PERSON	, who in
1867	DATE	nobly abdicated from power , ending the duarchy of nearly seven hundred years , and refusing to lift up his hand against the
Mikado	LOCATION	.

		He is still living in
Tokyo	LOCATION	.

		We count his opin - ions among the most valuable in the book , and we are inclined to accept the justice of his views .

		These show that there was no real revolution , but a restoration of the Imperial power , a return to ancient unity , for which the teachings and example of his house -LRB- Mito -RRB- and of his ancestors had prepared the way .

		Space does not permit a detailed sketch of this intellectually new Empire .

		Almost everything that portrays external
Japan	LOCATION	is here set forth .

		The style is as clear as the matter is interesting .

		The original papers , by nearly threescore writers , were written in Japanese , and translated in mas - terly style by Captain
Frank Brinkley	PERSON	, editor of `` The
Japan	LOCATION	Mail . ''

		This is a feat worthy of admiration .

		Mr.
Brinkley	PERSON	is a veritable
Columbus	LOCATION	in discovering idioms and equivalents .

		Specialists in their particular fields have dis - cussed the Constitution , Political Parties ,
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, Legal Institutions , Politics , Prisoners , 268 THE T > LAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	,
Finance	ORGANIZATION	, Municipal Progress , Commercial and Industrial Progress .

		These and kindred sub - jects occupy chiefly the first volume .

		In the second volume the writers deal with the things unseen , which the commercial and aver - age foreigner , including the `` globe-trotter '' and the person who has '' been there , '' in home and club and with the automobile , knows so little about .

		There is probably no country on earth concerning which the opinions of the mere trav - eller and resident visitor , or even quondam alien missionary , may or do count so little as
Japan	LOCATION	.

		No other people provoke such contradictory expressions of praise or blame .

		The reason is very simple . ''

		Shallows murmur , but the deeps are dumb . ''


Japan	LOCATION	does not , can not , reveal her - self all at once .

		There is no nation in
Asia	LOCATION	so young , or whose history , even the oldest part of it , is so modern , as
Japan	LOCATION	; while all the time foreigners go there and talk about it as though it had a '' hoary '' civilization like that of
China	LOCATION	.

		Yet while the Japanese can not satisfy modern criticism as to their existence as a nation much before the twelfth century of our era , yet in one sense
Japan	LOCATION	is an epitome of all
Asia	LOCATION	.

		The Japanese are not a race .

		They are a mixture of races ,
Arian	PERSON	, Semitic ,
Malay	LOCATION	, and Tartar .

		No people in eastern
Asia	LOCATION	have so large an infu - sion of Aryan blood in their veins .

		The com - monest words in our language and in theirs are the same as to roots , while almost every word pertaining to things known to civilization are later than their era of initial writing , and of that great influx of letters and art and architecture which came in the train of Confucian ethics and the Buddhist religion in the sixth century .

		The opinions of people who know next to nothing about the Japanese language , art , literature , or history , are very nearly worthless .

		To know a people we must know what forces move and have moved them .

		There are cosmic and ocean currents that move the invisible nine-tenths of the Japanese iceberg far more than do the winds and surface currents the visible one - tenth .

		This second volume is exceedingly rich in subjects pertaining to religions , culture , and education , the philosophies and sciences , phi - lanthropy and the fine arts , journalism and literature , social intercourse and socialism ; and it will richly repay both reading and study .

		Of course
Count Okuma	ORGANIZATION	is an optimist .

		There is no country and no people like those of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The gifts of nature have been lavished there .

		With what Count
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	declares in his buoyant and youthful optimism , one can find no more fault than with Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, who depicted a kind of Middle Ages that had no existence , unless one shuts one 's eyes to the dark and dreadful side of them .

		The Count dodges scientific chronology and the cold criti - cism of the alien in regard to the prehistoric days when there were many Mikados , for he is loyal to the core , and neither
Mikadoism	PERSON	nor the primitive documents can be handled rudely in
Japan	LOCATION	, where academic freedom is not yet very well known .

		Ancestral worship did not exist in ancient
Japan	LOCATION	.

		He says nothing about the awful famines , the millions of outcasts and the brutalities of feudalism .

		He drags no skeletons from their closets .

		He writes more out of his feelings than out of critically sifted facts or rigid perspective , when he sets forth the history of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		As a subjective , personal presentation of
Japan	LOCATION	's development , his three chapters are invaluable ; but the cold-hearted alien wants more critical salt on his salad .

		Nor can we understand how any book giving a true history of the last fifty years can be written with - out a special chapter and pretty full accounts of the work done by the thousands of expert Europeans and Americans , including a regiment or two of teachers who from
1857	DATE	took hold of the boys who are now or have been the recon - structors of Japanese society and government .

		Some one must write the history of the yatoi -LRB- hired foreigners -RRB- who taught the Japanese the way out of mediae valism into modern life .

		After reading the book through and finding what to us are omissions , but few inaccuracies , we commend the work most heartily to all who would seek to understand the real spirit of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		It confirms , if confirmation were needed , the fact that the supreme purpose of
Japan	LOCATION	is , and has ever been , next to her own self - preservation , the uplift and regeneration of
Asia	LOCATION	.


Japan	LOCATION	is a true pupil of the Anglo-Saxon nations .

		THE DIAL 269 of method and of approach .

		The illustrations are drawn from the playwrights of all time -- from iEschylus to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, from
Sophocles	LOCATION	to
Maeterlinck	PERSON	.

		As we learn in the prefatory note , the work is '' a study of the technic of the drama .

		It is intended , not for those who want to write plays , but for those who wish to learn how plays are written now , and how they have been written in the past .

		It is the result of a belief that the fundamental principles of the drama are the same throughout the ages .

		... It is devoted mainly to an examination of the structural framework , '' and `` discusses only incidentally the psychology , the philosophy , and the poetry '' which we admire in the great pieces that have reached us .

		The author asserts in his initial chapter , '' The Study of the Drama , '' that the art he discusses '' does not lie wholly within the limit of literature . ''

		The playwright may call to his aid the arts of the actor , the musician , the painter , and the sculptor ; and the '' literary merit of a play does not reside so much in its mere wording as in its solid structure , in the logic of the plot , in the sincerity of its character - drawing . ''

		The reader of a play '' should endeavor always to transport himself from the library into the theatre and to visualize an actual performance . ''

		Fine writing , as such , is of little importance ; the thing to be emphasized is form and structure as adapted to presenta - tion .

		This point of view Professor
Matthews	PERSON	maintains throughout .

		It is at the root of his treatment of the themes of the succeeding chap - ters .

		Let us see , briefly , what these chapters contain .

		The second , third , and fourth are given to a study of the influence exerted upon the play - wright by the actor , the theatre , and the audi - ence .

		The medium of the playwright is such that he '' can never claim the right of solitary self-expression , which the lyrist may assert '' ; he must appeal to the public as a whole , `` not to any coterie of dilettants . ''

		He must heed the performer 's demand for action and character ; and this demand is wholesome in so far as it tends '' to stiffen the dramatic action , to inten - sify the passionate climax , '' and '' to persuade the poet to a larger and deeper reproduction of human nature . ''

		He must bow to the exactions of the contemporary theatre ; and , if he be a modern , realize that the scenery of our stage forbids the quick shiftings of place and the poetic descriptions of Elizabethan days .

		He must also reckon with the audience , with its prejudices , its mental and social customs ; for the drama is the most democratic of the arts , and can not exist without the multitude .

		The journeyman playright may pander to these in - fluences , or be hampered by the limitations they impose ; but the masters have found them a source of strength -- have hearkened to the wants of the actor , accepted the current stage practices , and made themselves the most popular playwrights of their time . ''

		The Law of the Drama '' and '' A Chapter of Definitions '' are the next two titles in the volume .

		Under the former , the author approves the definition of the drama as `` a story in dialogue shown in action before an audience . ''

		Action , however , may not consist of '' mere move - ment or external agitation . ''

		Brunetiere has made it plain that '' the drama must reveal the human will in action ; and that the central figure in a play must know what he wants and must strive for it with incessant determination . ''

		It follows as a corollary that certain scenes are essential , and must be , not inferred or related , but represented on the stage ; '' they are the scenes in which we can see the struggle of con - tending wills . ''

		In '' A Chapter of Definitions '' we confront the bewildering terminology of the stage .

		The terms '' chronicle-play '' and '' tragedy-of - blood '' suggest special types of the drama ; farce and melodrama , as opposed to high-comedy and the serious drama , permit the plot to dominate the characters ; but the usage of the important words '' comedy '' and '' tragedy '' is far from fixed .

		From the French vocabulary of critical terms we may transplant three phrases to denote certain effects of comic dialogue : the mot -LRB-
Tesprit	ORGANIZATION	is a witticism existing for its own sake ; the mot de situation takes its color from the incident that calls it forth ; the mot de caractere springs from the individuality of the speaker . ''

		Traditions and Conventions '' are next treated . ''

		A tradition is an accepted way of doing things , which may or may not be com - pletely i natural . ' ''

		`` A convention is a depart - ure from the fact , '' an implied contract wherein neither playwright nor spectator '' has a right to violate the conditions of the treaty . ''

		All conventions are also traditions ; but the converse does not hold .

		Necessary conventions '' are the result of three conditions of theatrical perform - ance , '' -- limited time , which compels a compact and luminous dialogue ; observation by the spec - tator , which takes it for granted that the fourth wall of the room is removed ; and an overhearing of everything said .

		The soliloquy , a convention 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, with an interesting history , is obsolescent as a means of conveying information about facts , but as a revelation of the hero 's conflicting emotions at a crisis its use is higher and more defensible .

		Under the head of `` Dramatic Characteri - zation '' the author tells us that although '' a sufficient story is a prerequisite to immediate success , it will -LSB- in itself -RSB- bestow only a fleeting popularity . '' ''

		We reserve our warmest regard for the men and the women who carry it on .

		It is by veracity of character delineation , by sub - tlety of psychology , that the great plays are great . ''

		And '' in the final analysis , it is by his power of projecting characters that the dram - atist survives . ''

		Whether , in evolving his play , he begins with plot or with character matters little , so he gives the appearance of a plot sub - ordinate to character .

		He must exclude those details in the history of his characters that have no bearing on the story , yet through his creative imagination endow them with a life so large and a personality so rich that variety and complexity will be their possession .

		The next themes are '' The Logic of Con - struction '' and `` The Analysis of a Play . ''

		A stringent constructive faculty is necessary to the playwright .

		In the strict limitation of his time , and in the need to make things clear as he goes , exciting curiosity perhaps , but never misleading , he is hedged by difficulties unknown to the writer of prose fiction . ''

		He can not rely on constructed decoration ; he can only decorate his construction . ''

		In his exposition -- that is , his conveying of the knowledge essential to a fol - lowing of the plot -- he must avoid on one hand those devices which are trite and outworn , and on the other that obscurity which is fatal .

		His plot must have beginning , middle , and end , showing a segment from life which is complete within itself .

		He must exclude chance and caprice altogether , or reduce them to a minimum and confine them to that part of the story which he does not present on the stage .

		The more nearly every action seems the inevitable result of the characters and the conditions , the finer and more enduring will his achievement be .

		But if his method of construction is not sternly logical , -- if he does not present an essential struggle , consistent characters , happily-chosen scenes , large truth to life , etc. , -- the spectator will know , though blindly perhaps , what an analysis will disclose as unavoidable , that the interest is not focused and therefore not main - tained .

		In the chapter on '' The Elizabethan Dra - matists '' the author states that the literary form which happens to be popular in any given period is certain to attract men whose native gift lies elsewhere .

		So it was in the days of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, for the talents of many of the play - wrights were not primarily dramaturgic .

		The audience could be pleased without firmly - textured plots , and the playwrights did not trouble themselves about the readers of the future .

		Their work was better in parts than as a whole : Lamb 's Selections show them at their best , and indiscriminate eulogies have given us too exalted an opinion of them .

		Their poetic merits are superb , but , excepting Shakespeare , '' they are great as playwrights only occasion - ally , and almost , as it were , by accident . ''

		Linked with this chapter is its supplement , '' The Poetic Drama and the Dramatic Poem . ''

		Here the author affirms that the closet-drama does not justify itself , because it is too easy ; its writer lacks the stimulation of a grapple with difficulties .

		Moreover , those plays which have been intended for acting , but have included also a deliberately poetic strain , have failed in the theatre '' because their authors did not keep an eye single on the stage .

		They may have had the impatient spectator in mind , but they had also the leisurely reader ; and as a result they fell between two stools . '' ''

		Whenever and wherever the poetic drama has existed , it has been primarily dramatic and only secondarily poetic . ''

		The final chapter -- for , unluckily for the reader , there are only thirteen -- discusses '' The Three Unities . ''

		It reminds us that the ever - valid unity of action is the only one to which Aristotle gave formal statement , and traces the hampering application of the unities of time and of place to the critics of the Italian Renas - cence .

		Yet '' there is , after all , something to be urged in behalf of the three unities . ''

		Of this there is evidence in two works of practical nineteenth-century playwrights -- in the '' Fran - cillon '' of the younger
Dumas	PERSON	and the '' Ghosts '' of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		This review attempts to give hints , rather than a summary , of what the volume contains .

		The brief and rather dogmatic statements fail to do justice to Professor
Matthews	PERSON	, who puts his points fairly , without contention .

		The book as a whole is delightful and illuminating .

		An appendix contains pertinent '' Suggestions for Study , '' together with some concise and helpful '' Bibliographical Suggestions . ''

		THE DIAL 271 Biographical , Studies of Wild Animals .

		* Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	entered the world of letters in
1883	DATE	with an article on the Striped Gopher .

		Three years later he read a paper before the Historical and Scientific Society of
Manitoba	LOCATION	, on the Mammals of
Manitoba	LOCATION	.

		This modest little article formed the nucleus of the present magnificent work , ''
Life Histories of Northern Animals	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The bare statement hardly suggests the extraordinary possibilities of such an expansion .

		Roughly speaking , the same species are treated in both -- forty-nine in the pamphlet of
1886	DATE	, and sixty in the latter work .

		The former , however , covered but fifteen pages , while the latter fills two huge volumes of
1267	DATE	pages .

		The pamphlet was reprinted in
1887	DATE	, in a slightly enlarged form , treating fifty-two species .

		This reprint contained six illustrations by the author .

		The new work is illustrated with 68 maps and 560 drawings , many of them full - page .

		Mr.
Seton	PERSON	divides his work into two parts , or volumes , the first devoted to Grass - eaters and the second to Flesh-eaters .

		The former includes the Deer family , the Wapiti or
Canadian Elk	ORGANIZATION	, the Northern Whitetailed Deer , the Blacktailed Mule-deer , the
Moose	PERSON	, and the
Woodland Caribou	LOCATION	; the Prong-horned Ante - lope ; the American Bison or
Buffalo	LOCATION	; the
Squirrel	PERSON	family ; the Canadian Beaver ; eleven members of the wide-spread
Mouse	PERSON	family ; the Gray-gopher ; the Jumping-mouse ; the
Porcu	LOCATION	- pine : and the Hare family .

		The second volume embraces the
Canada	LOCATION	Lynx ; the Kit-fox and
Royal Fox	ORGANIZATION	, the
Gray Wolf	LOCATION	and Coyote ; the Otter ,
Weasel	LOCATION	,
Mink	ORGANIZATION	,
Spruce Marten	PERSON	,
Fisher	PERSON	,
Wolverine	ORGANIZATION	, Skunk , and Badger ; the
Raccoon	LOCATION	; the Grizzly-bear and Black-bear ; the
Shrew	PERSON	family ; the Star-nosed Mole ; and the Web - tailed Bats .

		Although the work is limited to the sixty species frund in
Manitoba	LOCATION	, in tracing their life - histories Mr.
Seton	PERSON	follows them into all parts of their ranges ; and in this way the book is to a large extent an account of the mammals of
North America	LOCATION	.

		The author says : '' Thirty years of personal observations are herein set forth ; every known fact bearing on the habits of these animals has , as far as possible , been presented , and everything in my power has been done to make this a serious , painstaking , loving attempt to penetrate the intimate side of the animals ' lives -- the side that has so long been overlooked , because until lately we have persistently regarded wild things as mere living targets , •

Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		and have seen in them nothing but savage or timorous creatures , killing or escaping being killed , quite for - getting that they have their homes , their mates , their problems , and their sorrows , -- in short , a home-life that is their real life , and very often much larger and more important than that of which our hostile standpoint has given us such fleeting glimpses . ''

		In addition to his own personal observations , covering nearly every State in the
Union	LOCATION	, and most of the Canadian Provinces , Mr.
Seton	PERSON	has gathered together from widely-scattered sources the evidence of hundreds of other students of the animal life of the continent , the result forming a most remarkable series of animal biographies .

		For some years past Mr.
Seton	PERSON	has been widely known as a writer of entertaining stories of animal life .

		Some readers , judging the form rather than the substance , and with very limited knowledge of the facts of wild animal life , have assumed a rather patronizing attitude toward these tales , and jumped to the conclusion that they were founded on nothing more substantial than the vivid imagination of a clever maker of fiction .

		Not the least important feature of the present work is the testimony it affords , in clear and scientific terms , as to the substantial accuracy of these animal stories .

		Here , as in so many other cases , the fact is shown to be often more wonderful than fiction .

		Another important result of Mr.
Seton	PERSON	's work is the correction of many popular misconceptions .

		One of these concerns the speed of wild animals .

		We have all heard marvellous stories as to the phenomenal speed of the coyote , the antelope , and several other animals .

		After gathering all the available data on the subject , Mr.
Seton	PERSON	has reached the deliberate conclusion that the horse still holds his own . ''

		There seems no good rea - son , '' says he , '' for supposing that any creature on legs -- two , three , or four -- ever went for any distance faster than a blood race-horse .

		Salva - tor 's mile in 1 minute 35 ^ seconds is the fast - est pace reliably recorded for anything afoot . ''

		Tabulating the evidence , Mr.
Seton	PERSON	puts the fast - est four-footed animals in the following order : Race-horse , best speed for a mile at the rate of 34 miles an hour ; Prong-horned antelope , 32 miles an hour ; Greyhound , 30 miles ; Texan Jack - rabbit , 28 ; Common Fox , 26 ;
Northern Coyote	ORGANIZATION	, 24 ; Foxhound , 22 ; and American Gray-wolf , 20 .

		It is interesting to note that a man 's best speed for a mile is at the rate of 14 miles an hour .

		A number of ancient errors concerning the Beaver are also exposed .

		It can not and does not drive stakes ; it never plasters the lodge with mud outside -- all beaver-lodges are finished out - side with sticks ; it does not use its tail as a 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, trowel ; it does not suck the air out of sticks to make them stay down ; it does not cut or carry large logs or use them in the dam ; when caught in a steel trap it does not deliberately amputate the foot , but twists about and pulls until it is torn off .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Seton	PERSON	, in his very readable chapter on the Beaver , does much to rehabilitate the character of this sagacious animal .

		Time was when the Beaver was popularly endowed with almost superhuman intelligence .

		Of late years we have been inclined to rush to the opposite extreme , and deny it even moderate sagacity .

		The truth lies between .

		The facts here presented , and amply substantiated from the works of such careful observers as
Lewis H. Morgan	PERSON	,
Audubon	LOCATION	,
Bachman	PERSON	, and other naturalists , including the author , place the Beaver in the first rank among four-footed arti - sans .

		It is gratifying , therefore , to know that successful efforts are now being made to restore the Beaver to some of his old haunts , in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Ontario	LOCATION	, and
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		`` There can be no doubt , '' says Mr.
Seton	PERSON	, `` that the Beaver did more to open up
Canada	LOCATION	than any other creature or product .

		It was the pursuit of the Beaver that lured on the early explorers and that brought here the original colonists .

		It was Beaver fur that bought for white men the manufactures of
Europe	LOCATION	that were needed to make life tolerable when first our people took to the woods ; and it is fitting indeed that this creature , the symbol of energy , peace , and industry , should be the emblem of the country for which it did so much . ''

		One is tempted to quote some of the many interesting bits of animal biographies found everywhere between the covers of these two substantial volumes , but limits of space make this impossible .

		It is sufficient to assure the reader that he will find here an immense amount of trustworthy information on each of the ani - mals whose life-histories are given ; and the whole is presented in such fascinating form , and so attractively illustrated , that he will find it impossible to skip a single page .

		Where every point has been covered with so much care and thoroughness , it seems almost an impertinence to suggest additional informa - tiou .

		One or two facts may , however , be worth mentioning .

		On page 271 it is stated that the horse arrived on the great plains of the North - west -- the
Buffalo	LOCATION	range -- about the close of the eighteenth century .

		In the Journal of
Anthony Hendry	PERSON	, 1754-55 -LRB- Transactions of the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Canada	LOCATION	,
1908	DATE	-RRB- the Black - feet are described as being accomplished horse - men in the middle of the eighteenth century ; and there is reason to believe that the arrival of this powerful factor in the extirpation of the
Buffalo	LOCATION	must be carried back to the beginning of the eighteenth century .

		The same journal may be cited among early records of the
Buffalo	LOCATION	in what is now the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	; as may also Cooking 's Journal , 1772-73 -LRB- Transactions of
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	,
1909	DATE	-RRB- .

		Early mention of the Antelope will be found in Cooking 's Jour - nal , and in the narrative of
Larocque	PERSON	-LRB-
Canadian Archives Publication	ORGANIZATION	,
1910	DATE	-RRB- .

		In addition to its many other merits , Mr.
Seton	PERSON	's splendid work is equipped with an Intro - duction containing a sketch of the physical features of
Manitoba	LOCATION	, and an outline of the plan of treatment ; a Bibliography ; and a Synoptic Index .

		The
Story of New England Expansion	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The muse of history , it is well known , has of late been turning her attention in various new directions .

		Kings and parliaments have not ceased to have their interest ; the lives of presi - dents and generals are still fascinating ; but we are more and more becoming interested in the lives of common men , the unknown toilers whose names are only in rare instances handed down , yet whose influence lives in the institu - tions they helped to frame and perpetuate .

		The humble and illiterate have always been purveyors of comedy ; we now concede that in their obscure lives there may also be supreme tragedies .

		One is reminded of these things in reading Miss
Mathews	PERSON	's volume , which has to do with the peopling of
New England	LOCATION	and the northern Middle and
Middle	LOCATION	-
Western States	LOCATION	by the sturdy , radical , God-fearing Puritans and their descend - ants .

		One is reminded , also , of the many - sidedness of history ; since this book suggests not only the comic and tragic possibilities of pioneer life , but also its romance .

		The pioneer epoch has already become for us a remote world , in which both
Arthur Dimmesdale	PERSON	and
Natty Bumppo	ORGANIZATION	have their being .

		In these days of lightning communication with all parts of the country , we have quickly forgotten the time when a journey from western

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 central
New York	LOCATION	was a matter of weeks of difficult and dangerous travel .

		Miss
Mathews	PERSON	has , however , held resolutely to the less picturesque and romantic yet cer - tainly more important aspects of her subject , and has produced a substantial contribution to the early history of the northern
United States	LOCATION	.

		The subject is fresh , and the treatment of it is fitting and adequate .

		In the preparation of her work the author has had to evaluate and digest a mass of town , county , and state histories .

		It may be remarked , in passing , that the value of such works of local history becomes evident when one begins to labor on a subject like this .

		The author 's sense of proportion is commend - able .

		Instead of piling up details which would only have swollen the volume without furnish - ing more light on the topics involved , she has frequently selected typical groups of facts , and thus constantly gives general impressions -- a thing which is of the utmost importance .

		What were the causes of emigration to the New World ?

		Miss
Mathews	PERSON	has well summed them up : lack of religious liberty -LRB- a condition due to excessive radicalism -RRB- , church quarrels , the desire to retrieve fallen fortunes or make more money by trade or agriculture , the Wan - derlust always characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon temperament .

		And the same causes which brought the English to the shores of
America	LOCATION	have spurred on the more radical and adven - turous spirits to extend the frontier and experi - ment there with their ideas of education and government of church and state . ''

		The tendency of those portions of the country first peopled has been to grow conservative , and even to crystallize , as
England	LOCATION	had seemed to have done when the first emigrants left her shores .

		As the towns on the coast grew slower to change character and institu - tions , the more radical spirits began to chafe , and turn to newer sections where they might be unhampered by either tradition or habit .

		They have not , however , been wholly divested of either , and have turned as their fathers had done to the civilization of their birth-place for precedents , compromising , conceding , and readjust - ing because of new conditions and new elements , and thus shaping institutions which were neither wholly new nor entirely old .

		Again and again , with each succeeding generation , has the process been repeated , with
England	LOCATION	as the background , the older colonies as the ' middle distance , ' and the newest of our states as the foreground . ''

		The story of the settlement of
New England	LOCATION	is of great interest .

		Up to
1629	DATE	only a few villages were planted along the coast from
Plymouth	LOCATION	in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to
St. George	LOCATION	in
Maine	LOCATION	.

		Then came the beginning of the En - glish emigration due to the discontent aroused by the harsh and blind policy of
Charles I. John Endicott	PERSON	with 380 emigrants came in
1629	DATE	to
Lynn	LOCATION	and Salem .

		The next year a thousand more came , to found
Boston	LOCATION	and other towns ; and by
1637	DATE	the eastern coast of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	had been settled as far south as
Plymouth	LOCATION	, and beginnings had been made at
Springfield	LOCATION	, and in
Maine	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and Con - necticut .

		By
1660	DATE	the coast from
St. George to Greenwich	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Connecticut	LOCATION	-RRB- had been practically all settled , and the settlements on the Connec - ticut River had largely grown .

		Two features characterize the earliest settlements : -LRB- a -RRB- the community always centred about the church ; -LRB- b -RRB- education was generously supported .

		For example , '' The
Massachusetts Bay General Court	ORGANIZATION	passed an act in
1649	DATE	compelling every town of fifty householders to appoint a teacher for all their children ; and further requiring a grammar school for every town of one hundred families or more .

		Connecticut and
New Haven	ORGANIZATION	adopted the same system , as did
Plymouth	LOCATION	at a later time . ''

		The period from the Restoration to the peace of
Utrecht	LOCATION	was one of rapid development of the colonies , though a terrible setback came in
King Philip	LOCATION	's War .

		In
1675	DATE	there were perhaps 120,000 people in
New England	LOCATION	, of whom 16,000 could bear arms .

		The uprising under
Philip	LOCATION	, however , wiped out scores of villages , and the frontier receded to such an extent that by
1713	DATE	it had little more than made up the ground lost in
1675-7	DATE	.

		Miss
Mathews	PERSON	thinks she detects , by
1713	DATE	, that difference between the frontiersmen and the inhabitants of the older towns on the coast to which we have alluded .

		Concerning tendencies on the frontier , where the more radical pioneers still struggled crudely though vigorously with the forces of nature , the author remarks : '' It was on the frontier that men from the various colonies mingled , and while they held in common the stern religious views and educational ideas of their ancestors , these were tempered by contact with others of somewhat different cast ; so that while fundamentally the ideals of all were the same , -- all were striving toward civil and religious liberty , and all were tenacious of their rights , -- individualism still found its freest development out at the edge of civilization . ''

		With the
Peace of Utrecht	ORGANIZATION	the frontier began to be pushed northward and westward much more rapidly .

		The next forty years saw the
Maine	LOCATION	settlements carried north to
Waterville	LOCATION	, the
New Hampshire	ORGANIZATION	settlements extended to
Bristol	LOCATION	-LRB- and on the
Connecticut	LOCATION	to
Charlestown	LOCATION	-RRB- , and begin - nings made in southeastern
Vermont	LOCATION	, south - eastern
New York	LOCATION	, and northern and southern
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		It was in this period that specu - 274 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, lation in lands became common , as it did in
England	LOCATION	about
1720	DATE	.

		Owing to the repressive measures passed by
England	LOCATION	on colonial manu - facturing schemes , the capital which had now accumulated in the colonies could find no other form of investment than in land .

		As the grants of land had to be settled within three or seven years , much pressure was brought to bear on families to move to new settlements .

		Influences tending to check emigration were fear of the Indians , and the difficulty of getting titles to new lands , largely because of the ignorance of geography , which resulted in overlapping grants or in setting too indefinite boundaries .

		This was one of the chief factors making against the set - tlement of
Maine	LOCATION	.

		The three decades ending with the
Revolu	PERSON	- tionary War were marked by rapid colonial ex - pansion .

		The defective colonial charters were revised , titles were made secure , and as soon as peace was in sight the more restless and radical population surged to the north and the far West .

		Thirty-one new towns were begun in
Vermont	LOCATION	in 1776-81 , many
New Yorkers	LOCATION	settling there .

		Eleven towns in
Maine	LOCATION	date from 1780-1 , and the
Maine	LOCATION	frontier had then advanced north as far as
Orono	LOCATION	,
Machias	LOCATION	, and
Calais	LOCATION	.

		The num - ber of
Connecticut	LOCATION	students at
Dartmouth	LOCATION	is interesting ; 42.6 per cent of the graduates in 1770-90 were from
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		Beginnings were also made in northeastern
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The second half of this interesting book gives chiefly the story of the migrations from
New England	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	and the
Middle West	LOCATION	, from
1781	DATE	to
1865	DATE	.

		The great movement into
Central New York	LOCATION	began in
1783	DATE	and reached its climax by
1820	DATE	, when the entire state except the Adirondack region had been settled .

		The census of
1850	DATE	showed 6.6 per cent of the inhabitants of
New York	LOCATION	to have been born in
New England	LOCATION	.

		By
1840	DATE	Ohio 's frontier had disappeared , the northern part and some dis - tricts in the centre and southeast having been occupied by
New England	LOCATION	settlers .

		In
1850	DATE	, 65,632 Ohioans , or 3.3 per cent of the popula - tion , had been born in
New England	LOCATION	.

		The numbers and percentages of native New Eng - enders in the neighboring states in that year were as follows :
Indiana	LOCATION	, 10,646 , or 1.08 per cent ;
Illinois	LOCATION	, 36,532 , or 4.29 per cent ;
Michi	PERSON	- gan , 30,923 , or 7.78 per cent ;
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, 27,029 , or 8.8 per cent .

		Concerning the settle - ment of
Indiana	LOCATION	,
Miss Mathews	PERSON	remarks : ''
Indiana	LOCATION	was never a favorite stopping-place for the
New Englanders	LOCATION	, for the Southern element was strong here , and the Virginian or Kentuckian was apt to con - fuse the shrewd , unscrupulous ' Yankee ' peddler of cheap clocks with the substantial
Connecticut	LOCATION	farmer , and to treat the two alike . ''

		Among the reasons for emigration to the Western frontier ,
Miss Mathews	PERSON	finds the most potent in general to have been the search for cheap and fertile land Connected with this as a powerful motive has been discontent with existing social or religious conditions , and the reluctance to yield to the will of a hostile ma - jority .

		With the emigrants went the institutions they had fostered in
New England	LOCATION	-- school and church and town-meeting ; yet these under - went certain changes . ''

		The church must become more liberal , it must take on the Presbyterian form if that would insure its growth ; it must be divorced from politics , since one reason for the removal to the frontier had often been the union of church and state upon the coast .

		Far from escaping from the majority rule , the pioneer had become subject to it anew ; but it was now his majority , and he could afford to yield to gain his ends .

		The school had to change also .

		Separation of the sexes had been the rule in
New England	LOCATION	; coeducation became the habit of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Partly due to lack of funds , partly perhaps owing to the intense feeling of equality not only between man and man , but between man and woman , the coedu - cational plan became the custom for the Western states .

		It was not always adopted willingly , for con - servatism and tradition in such matters die hard ; but in the end a shrewd business sense dictated the policy , and it won . ''

		The reaction of the frontier upon the older parts of the country is an interesting phase of the subject , which the author might have treated at much greater length .

		Clark g < NoRTHUP > The IjrFE-STORY or a Great Musician .

		* Musical biography is often sadly lacking in interest for the general reader , so intent are its writers upon questions of technique .

		A happy exception to this rule is found in a recent book on
Handel	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
R. H. Streatfeild	PERSON	, published in the
New Library of Music	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author says in his preface : `` I have tried to find the man
Handel	PERSON	in his music ; to trace his charac - ter , his view of life , his thoughts , feelings , and aspirations , as set forth in his work . ''

		This point of view is consistently held throughout the book ; and though the critical study of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's work is thorough and painstaking enough to command the admiration of a student , we never lose sight of the man .

		He is vividly portrayed in all his vigorous uprightness , his genuine modesty and independence , at a time when ser - vility was the rule .

		In summing up the story of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's struggles in
London	LOCATION	, the author says : '' He was an incarnation of the spirit of revolt against the old system of patronage that had ruled the world of music so long .

		Here was a man who , while every other musician in the land remained at an angle of forty-five degrees in the presence of his princely patron , resolutely stood upright , went his own way , and snapped his fingers in their ducal faces . ''

		Mr.
Streatfeild	PERSON	also heartily disagrees with those amiable early biographers who have tried to show that
Handel	PERSON	was what is called '' a pious man , '' adding that '' his religion was eminently of the type which , as Disraeli observed , all sensible men profess but no sensible man talks about . ''

		Nearly half of the book treats of the external events in the musician 's life , his boyhood in
Halle	LOCATION	, his years of work and growing reputa - tion in
Italy	LOCATION	, his struggles , defeats , and final success in
London	LOCATION	.

		The stories of his early precocity are critically examined to determine what elements of truth they contain ; the dis - cussion of the four years spent in

		The and
Venice	LOCATION	gives an excellent idea of his noble patrons and is full of the atmosphere of the times ; and the struggles of his
London	LOCATION	years are described with a fairness and sympathy most refreshing .

		The breadth of view , so noticeable a feature of this book , is nowhere better shown than in the following interesting passage , de - scribing
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's triumph . ''

		The battle was won at last .

		The struggle had been long and severe , but
Handel	PERSON	had come out a conqueror in the end .

		With everything against him , he had won by sheer force of personality .

		What
Pitt	PERSON	was doing in the world of politics ,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	had done in the world of art .

		Different as were the spheres in which they worked , the ` Great Commoner ' and the composer of '' The Messiah ' had much in common .

		Both were poets in an age of prose , transcendentalists waging mortal con - flict with the forces of materialism .

		In the Parliament of that day ,
Pitt	PERSON	stood alone ; the depth of his convic - tion , his fiery energy , his poetic imagination , his appeal to the higher instincts of mankind contrasting strangely with the mercenary opportunism of the world in which he moved .

		England rallied round the man whose hands were clean in an age of corruption , whose life was pure in the midst of debauchery , and who loved his country with a passionate reverence .

		Handel 's appeal was based on similar grounds .

		The turning-point of his career was when in
1747	DATE	he threw aside his subscription and appealed to the public at large .

		In the middle class he found the audience that he had sought in vain in the pampered worldlings of the court .

		The splendid seri - ousness of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's music , its wide humanity , its exal - tation of thought , its unfaltering dignity of utterance , had fallen on deaf ears so long as he appealed only to an aristocratic audience .

		It was in the heart and brain of the middle class that
Handel	ORGANIZATION	found at last an echo to his clarion call . ''

		The latter half of the book is devoted to a careful study of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		With rare discrimination , and painstaking though never tedious accuracy , the writer traces the plot of each of the forty-three operas and thirty-four oratorios .

		He emphasizes in each instance that distinctive atmosphere so characteristic of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's music .

		He traces through various works his three distinct styles of composition , -- the earliest , purely German , that he learned from Zachow at
Halle	LOCATION	; his operatic manner , almost wholly Italian ; then the later English method , at first influenced by
Purcell	PERSON	, '' whom
Handel	PERSON	s mighty strength of wing soon left far behind . ''

		Mr.
Streatfeild	PERSON	emphasizes especially one characteristic of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's music , much neglected by earlier writers , -- his feeling for Nature .

		The familiar Largo , for example , from the opera Serse , is sung by the hero ,
Xerxes	LOCATION	, standing under the boughs of his favorite plane - tree .

		In its broad , rich harmonies and satisfy - ing melody he who can may feel all the sense of shelter , content , and rest , inspired by the shade of a great tree .

		In speaking of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's setting 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, for L' Allegro , the author says : `` It is a series of exquisite genre pictures , sketched with the lightest touch and yet elaborated with the most intimate detail . ''

		Again , in the analysis of ``
Israel	LOCATION	in
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' attention is called to the amazing picture of the '' weary march of the Israelites through the desert .

		Then the serene loveliness of the land flowing with milk and honey is painted with a tranquil charm , intensified by the harsh discords of the preceding chorus .

		Handel appreciated the majesty and splendor of the sea as perhaps no other composer has done . ''

		One very interesting feature of the book is the author 's frequent comparison of
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's work with that of other great musicians , espe - cially with that of Bach .

		He thus effectively sums up in concluding the study of '' The Messiah '' : ''
Bach	PERSON	was unquestionably a more spiritually minded , or , as we now say , a more religious man , than
Handel	ORGANIZATION	.

		When he wrote the Sanctus he was rapt away from earth ... Handel 's feet are always upon solid earth .

		His imagination opened all portals , but he passed none .

		When he wrote the • Hallelujah ' chorus he ' did think he saw heaven opened and the great God Himself , ' but he was not , like
Bach	PERSON	, caught up in spirit to the heaven that he beheld .

		Handel was an artist rather than a seer ... There was a good deal more of Titian than of
Fra Angelico	LOCATION	in
Handel	LOCATION	.

		For the rapture of spiritual ecstasy we ask of Handel in vain , but instead he gives us an all-embracing sympathy for every manifestation of human energy , that lifts his work far above sects and dogmas and makes it the common property of all mankind . ''

		In this way columns might be filled with extracts from this most readable book .

		A work of this kind can not fail to do valuable service in widening and rendering more intelligent the appreciation of music and its authors .

		her people , the new and unexpected developments for evil as well as for good of which her established institutions have been found capable . ''

		Within the past few months , while Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	has himself been occupied with the preparation of a revised edition of his ''
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, '' there has flowed from the presses on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	a veritable stream of volumes , each of which has been intended , within the scope marked out by its author , to make some contribution to the ever alluring , never finished interpretation of American life and nationality .

		Much the most ambitious project of the sort recently brought to light is that which has been undertaken by an English journalist long resident in this country , Mr.
A. Maurice Low	PERSON	.

		His book comprises nothing less than an attempt to elucidate the psychology of the American people .

		Most of us would be inclined at the outset , perhaps , to pro- nounce such a task impossible of accomplishment .

		The psychology of any mass of eighty or ninety millions of men and women is an extremely elusive thing ; and , furthermore , the people of
America	LOCATION	represent a conglomeration of racial elements such as would seem scarcely to admit of anything in the nature of composite characterization .

		Mr.
Low	PERSON	, however , is devoid of apprehensions .

		`` The psy - chology of the American people , '' he avers , '' pre - sents no miracle and is reducible to exact terms .

		We have here no unfathomable mystery .

		There are no gaps to be filled by speculative soaring . ''

		Recalling that for a good many years Mr.
Low	PERSON	has been writing of things American with very credit - able candor and discernment , one is constrained to possess himself in patience and await results .

		A volume recently published , `` The Planting of a Nation , '' is the first of a series in which Mr. Low proposes to trace the historical development of the American character , and , subsequently , to describe and appraise the principal traits of the present-day American citizen .

		Having set himself to write the biography of a people , it follows that he must begin with the incunabula of the race ; consequently , the initial volume is largely taken up with a survey of population origins , and of the climatic and other physical conditions by which the earlier generations of European settlers in
America	LOCATION	were surrounded .

		This is a well-tilled field , and it can not be said that Mr.
Low	PERSON	's contributions to our knowledge of it have been considerable .

		If we are to judge by his bibli - ography and foot-notes , there has been small resort to authorities other than the more obvious secondary writers .

		Still , it is but fair to observe that Mr.
Low	PERSON	disclaims any intention of writing history .

		His task , as he has conceived it , is rather to assume the facts and to proceed to an interpretation of them from certain novel points of view , principally the psychological .

		On this side , portions of the book are distinctly illuminating , more particularly those which deal with the contributions made to the American character by the Puritan .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 277 The Puritan , Mr. Low regards as the real founder of American institutions ; and the Puritan he de - clares to have been an Englishman of Englishmen , bringing with him to our shores English institutions , English morals , and the English mental attitude .

		Much stress is laid upon the proposition that the Puritan , while austere and fanatical and much given to morbid introspection , was neither without natural human affections , nor a sense of humor , nor averse to rational amusements ; also that the Puritan colonist , far from living in squalor or poverty , was `` in many respects better clothed and fed and housed than the mass of the English people living in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		That the men who first settled Vir - ginia were drawn from a higher social scale than the Puritans , and that morally and intellectually the Cavalier was the superior of the
New Englander	LOCATION	, is pronounced a delusion , propagated only by inexact historians and careless writers .

		Ample justice , however , is done the Cavalier ; and , in truth , the author in his later chapters comes dangerously near undermining the structure of Puritan supremacy which he has earlier set up . ''

		The American , '' he declares , '' is a blend of the Puritan and the Cava - lier , to accept an inexact terminology so rich in contrast ; a mixture of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
Virginia	LOCATION	; a product of the corn that ripened slowly under northern skies and the tobacco that sprung into life in the soil of the South .

		The influence of
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts is there , but so also is that of
Virginia	LOCATION	; and great as is the influence of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, that of
Virginia	LOCATION	is no less .

		It was tobacco that made
Virginia	LOCATION	so different from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	; it was
Virginia	LOCATION	that made the American so different from what he would have been had another
Massachusetts	LOCATION	taken root in the South . ''

		There is not , in the present volume , a great deal that is really new or striking ; but with more or less familiar material a substantial foundation has been laid and the author 's real opportunity lies yet ahead .

		If he shall be able to disentangle and to elucidate the psychology of the formation of American nationality after the achievement of political independence , his labors will have been well worth while .

		Not much less comprehensive than Mr.
Low	PERSON	's pro- ject in its chronological sweep is Mr.
Herbert Croly	PERSON	's volume on '' The Promise of American Life . ''

		What Mr.
Croly	PERSON	has sought to do is to give us an exposition of what he conceives to be the '' promise '' of Ameri - can life and institutions , together with some indica - tion as to what the prospects are respecting the realization of that promise .

		The promise consists substantially , we are told , in % i an improving popular economic condition , guaranteed by democratic polit - ical institutions , and resulting in moral and social amelioration . ''

		Consideration of so comprehensive a theme involves a survey of practically the whole of American political , economic , and social devel - opment .

		The larger portion of the book is therefore taken up with an historical sketch of American problems and American traditions from the days of Jeffersonian Republicanism to the presidency of
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, together with a series of chap - ters discussing at much length a wide variety of national questions and interests of the present day .

		The principal thesis is that at the outset , a century and a quarter ago ,
America	LOCATION	seemed clearly to our forefathers to give promise of becoming , almost inevitably , a veritable paradise of political freedom , economic opportunity , and social equality ; but that , large as the realization has been , it is manifest that the promise is yet far from complete fulfilment , -- that , indeed , the fulfilment must no longer be thought of as in any sense '' an inexorable national destiny , but rather as a conscious national purpose '' which may or may not attain its end .

		The problem upon whose solution the f ulfilment of the promise mainly depends is declared to be , not political , or religious , but social .

		`` The American problem is the social problem partly because the social problem is the democratic problem .

		American political and social leaders will find that in a democracy the problem can not be evaded .

		The American people have no irremediable political grievances .

		No good
Ameri	PERSON	- can denies the desirability of popular sovereignty and of a government which should somehow repre - sent the popular will .

		While our national institu - tions may not be a perfect embodiment of these doctrines , a decisive and a resolute popular majority has the power to alter American institutions and give them a more immediately representative char - acter .

		... In the long run , consequently , the ordi - nary American will have nothing irremediable to complain about except economic and social inequali - ties .

		In
Europe	LOCATION	such will not be the case .

		The several European peoples have , and will continue to have , political grievances , because such grievances are the inevitable consequence of their national his - tory and their international situation , and as long as these grievances remain , the more difficult social problem will be subordinated to an agitation for political emancipation .

		But the American people , having achieved democratic institutions , have noth - ing to do but to turn them to good account .

		In so far as the social problem is a real problem and the economic grievance a real grievance , they are bound under the American political system to come event - ually to the surface and to demand express and intelligent consideration .

		A democratic ideal makes the social problem inevitable and its attempted solu - tion indispensable . ''

		In following out his analysis of American develop - ment and of current American problems , Mr.
Croly	PERSON	ranges over a field that is truly enormous .

		Politics , constitutional law , international relations , industrial conditions , labor movements , reform programmes , educational questions , -- all these and many other things , are brought under survey .

		Comparison of American with European experience is frequent , -- there being in one place , for example , a fifty-page digression on democracy and nationality in the prin - cipal European states .

		Indeed , one puts down the book with the feeling that the author has undertaken too much , and that its usefulness to the
America	LOCATION	278 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, reader would have been much enhanced by a judicious elimination of a good deal that is commonplace and unessential , so that its unquestionably vital message might have been made to stand out in bolder relief .

		During the
winter of 1908-09	DATE	, Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	, as
Hyde	PERSON	lecturer at
the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	and at certain of the provincial universities , under - took to interpret to the French '' the things that seem vital , significant , and creative in the life and character of the American people . ''

		The first seven of a series of twenty-six conferences given in this connection have been brought together for American publication under title , `` The Spirit of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Those who are familiar with the charm with which Dr. van Dyke invariably invests poetry and essay alike will not require to be assured that the present papers are readable .

		Seemingly but slight sketches , they are none the less crowded with evidences of deep insight , and with interpretative analysis which is very far from superficial .

		The '' spirit of
America	LOCATION	'' is shown to comprise something more than sheer energy -- more than la vie intense , of which
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- peans have in late years heard so much that their conception of Americans has perhaps suffered more than the customary distortion .

		Love of fair play , unfailing will-power , the sentiment of common order - liness , a keen appreciation of the value of individual development , -- these are some of the factors which are described as entering , along with aggressive energy , into the make-up of our composite American spirit .

		In the book entitled '' Americans : An Impression '' Mr.
Alexander Francis	PERSON	has given us an English view of American conditions , especially social , industrial , and educational .

		The score of chapters comprising the book first appeared as a series of special articles in the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' and are to some extent already familiar to American readers .

		During his year 's residence in the
United States	LOCATION	, Mr.
Francis	PERSON	spent the larger part of his time in college and uni - versity centres ; and far the most valuable portions of his book are those in which he records his im - pressions -LRB- not unmingled with criticism -RRB- of academic methods and customs in this country .

		Admitting that the fundamental idea of elective studies is sound , he none the less condemns sweepingly the '' crude and unscientific elective system '' as it widely prevails ; and , as is to be expected from a foreign observer , he unhesitatingly deprecates the conditions attending intercollegiate athletics .

		Mr.
Van Wyck Brooks	PERSON	denominates his work on '' The Wine of the Puritans '' a study of present-day
America	LOCATION	.

		The texture is altogether too thin to warrant so pretentious a sub-title ; and yet in these happy-go-lucky musings of two American artists in
Italy	LOCATION	respecting the red wine of Puritanism , and the new bottles in which , under twentieth century American conditions , it is compelled to be treasured up , there are occasional touches of human philosophy in which more ponderous writers are apt to be bar - ren enough .

		It supplies much information regarding the life of its subject , particularly in the details of the reforms he has instituted in the government of

		THE DIAL , 279 itself .

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	's field , Mr.
Helm	PERSON	points out , is a narrow one , but she tills it perfectly . ''

		Only genius could give a vital and enduring fascination to a record concerned with the ordinary experiences of a few respectable country people almost all of one class . ''

		Her • ' inability to be unintelligible , '' to adopt a phrase of
Catharine Morland	PERSON	's , her natural dialogue , '' the bright people being differentiated from the dull by their talk , and not , as in most novels , by the author 's assurances '' ; her satiric humor , `` rare among wom - en , '' humor '' of the essential kind , which is so nearly akin to wit that it is often almost identical with it ... brothers who might be mistaken for one another by those who do not notice that the one has colder hands than the other '' ; her `` wonderfully true presentation of the hearts and minds of girls , '' she herself '' the most delightful of her own heroines , '' -- all these characteristics combine to produce a `` perennial timeliness '' which Mr.Helm finds augmented by her avoidance of accessory descriptions .

		He is a no less temperately spoken or sincerely devoted lover than Mr.
Knightley	PERSON	, and though a reader may discover on laying down the book that his sense of `` one of the supreme literary artists of the world , '' as Mr.
`` W. L. Phelps	PERSON	has styled the sprightly
Jane	PERSON	, is less vivid than that induced by the few pages of the professor 's introduction to the ``
Chawton	LOCATION	'' edition of the novels , he will not be averse to seeing some of his own thoughts affirmed in print .

		But when Mr.
Helm	PERSON	denies to the chief characters both passion and sentiment many people will no doubt hold with Professor
Phelps	PERSON	that he commits '' the old error of assuming that only those persons have passions who are unable to control them . ''

		Yet the most ardent admirer must find it easy to forgive a difference of opinion to the man who writes of Godmersham : `` The spirit of
Jane Austen	PERSON	abides in the delicious air of this quiet and unspoilt valley , where , when the wind blows strongly from the south-east , the salt of the sea-breezes mingles with the perfumes of the grass and wood smoke as pleasantly as the Attic wit of

Greece	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the first considerable English study of the subject written up from the sources .

		The title is slightly misleading , as there was nothing which can properly be styled a university before Greco-Roman times ; and even then the publicly endowed chairs and private schools of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Athens	LOCATION	,
Antioch	LOCATION	, and
Constantinople	LOCATION	, were rather '' faculties , '' as the French would call them , than universities .

		However , the intellectual content of their instruction was a direct development of the teaching in the schools of Isocrates and Plato in the
Athens	LOCATION	of the fourth century B. c. ; and in the later centuries '' University Life in Ancient
Athens	LOCATION	'' -LRB- to use the title of Professor Capes 's interesting sketch published in

		Rushing , '' hazing , tossing in a blanket , `` spreads , '' gowns , town-and-gown riots , and even muck-raking the col - leges , he shows us are no new thing under the sun .

		The two chief subjects taught were a philosophy inclining more and more to rhetoric , and a rhetoric slightly tinged with philosophy .

		As was to be ex - pected from the nature of his sources , Mr.
Walden	PERSON	has most to say of the rhetorical schools of the later empire .

		Rhetoric was taught through the study of literature with a view to the attainment of a correct classic style and facility in oratory either for its own sake or in preparation for the law .

		The result would be anathema to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, but it was not notably inferior to the education given by the literary and '' culture '' courses of a modern university under the elective system .

		It was , in fact , better in so far as efficiency was ruthlessly tested by the ability to im - provise an effective speech -- perhaps a useless but certainly not an easy accomplishment .

		Mr.
Walden	PERSON	has done his work welL A more philosophic treat - ment would have enlarged the earlier chapters deal - ing with pre-Roman times , and in particular would have emphasized with

Wellman	PERSON	's chapters have a clear , ingratiating style , enriched with frequent anecdotes from his own court-room experience or that of others .

		He begins by explain - ing the difference between an advocate and an office lawyer , or , as the English would put it , a barrister and a solicitor .

		Then in successive chapters he treats of the physical endowments , the mental equipment , and the educational qualifications that an advocate should have , the opportunity and rewards awaiting him , what preparation should be made for the trial of a case , the scene in court , the selecting of jury - men , the '' opening '' to the jury , the fine points of direct and cross-examination , the handling of dis - crediting documents , and the summing up .

		Note - worthy is the counsel on an early page to '' read everything '' if one would be a well-equipped advo - 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, cate ; there is likely to be use for every scrap of information , and for every grace of mind and deli - cacy of feeling acquired by reading good books and quantities of them .

		The author takes occasion to quote Senator Ingalls 's famous sonnet `` Oppor - tunity , '' to which one is tempted to reply by citing the more recent and quite differently conceived son - net of the same title which graced the pages of the
January	DATE	''
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		A statement concerning
Lord Mansfield	PERSON	, that in his early poverty he all but re - nounced the pursuit of the law and '' decided upon taking orders in the ministry , '' is likely , from its phraseology , to amuse or puzzle Mr.
Wellman	PERSON	's Brit - ish readers .

		A little later he gives a new form to the old adage attributed to
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, by citing
Napoleon	PERSON	as saying `` that the Almighty always seemed to be on the side which had the heaviest artillery . ''

		The author 's account of his first import - ant case is one of the best things in this volume of unusually interesting legal reminiscence and advice .

		A group of early Prof essor
C. T. Winchester	PERSON	, of
Wes	PERSON	- nineteenth-century ley an
University	ORGANIZATION	, whose admirable English essayists , b i ograp hy G f
John Wesley	PERSON	has given pleasure to many readers , gathers into a handy volume entitled `` A Group of English Essayists '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a half-dozen chapters which he de - scribes as `` for the most part , the result of many pleasant hours in a college seminary room . ''

		After a preliminary discussion of `` the new essay , '' the critical and discursive article of which
Jeffrey	PERSON	may be considered the inventor , he advances to the more inviting , more personal and intimate essay as writ - ten by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
Hazlitt	PERSON	and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, by De Quincey and
John Wilson	PERSON	; for these five masters of essay-writing are the subjects of Mr.
Winchester	PERSON	's chapters after the somewhat tiresomely arbitrary Lord
Jeffrey	PERSON	has been dismissed .

		In the treatment of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	it is to be noted that the author does not lament the genial
Elia	LOCATION	's
India House	ORGANIZATION	bondage , but rather regards his regular employment and assured income as fortunate , and points to the long list of noted writers '' who have managed to unite business and literature without detriment to either . ''

		His admiration for
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's style will satisfy the most enthusiastic .

		`` No one else in Lamb 's day , '' he asserts , `` wrote such English , and to find anything so perfect you will have to go back to the best pas - sages of the English Bible . ''

		Incidentally , he twice misquoted Lamb , writing '' the desk 's dull wood '' instead of '' the desk 's dead wood . ''

		In the remarks on De Quincey he goes so far in commendation of his style as to say that '' he is never verbose , '' that '' he never repeats the same thought with needless fulness of phrase , '' though he is `` the most prolix of mortals . ''

		Verboseness , however , or something exceedingly like it , is not so very hard to find in De Quincey 's super - foetated periods .

		It may be permitted , in a review of a book by a professor in the English department of a prominent university , to criticize his use of financial '' -LRB- he says of
John Wilson	PERSON	's income that it '' placed him beyond financial anxiety '' -RRB- in the sense of `` pecuniary . ''

		Financial , as
Webster	PERSON	de - fines the word , has to do with finance or public revenue .

		Why not observe the distinction ?

		How - ever , an infinitesimal blemish of this sort hardly detracts from the excellence of a book which is so manifestly the product of careful thought and ripe scholarship .

		_ The gambler , Fr0m the meS ° f En g lish sporting Tit * habitats journals , apparently , and from other and habits .

		miscellaneous sources , Mr.
Ralph Nevill	PERSON	has brought together a considerable amount of betting and racing history and anecdote , with appropriate illustrations from old prints , under the title , `` Light Come , Light Go '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The last decade of
George the Second	ORGANIZATION	's reign was a period of impassioned and reckless gambling among persons of quality , and from that time down to the close of the last century the author follows the his - tory of dicing and card-playing and other forms of gaming , chiefly as practised in his own country .

		His narrative has no lack of entertaining anecdote ; in fact , it is almost all anecdote , mostly amusing , but not seldom sounding a tragic note .

		Some of his illustrations of the gambling mania are strikingly odd .

		In
1813	DATE	a literary man of sporting tendencies , who had been an assistant master at
Rugby	ORGANIZATION	, laid a wager of five pounds that he could make two thou - sand pens in ten hours ; and the pens were made satisfactorily to the umpire , nearly two hours within the stipulated time .

		Another story , less edifying , tells of two gentlemen who undertook to drink against each other , one wine and his opponent water , on a wager .

		After a bottle and a half each , the water-drinker was forced to desist , being seized with illness which confined him to his bed for an unstated period .

		The writer 's experience at
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	, and his favorite method of wooing the goddess Fortune at that famous resort , will prove interesting , perhaps too interesting , to some readers .

		In his closing chapter he expresses himself in favor of licensed gambling as opposed to the illicit practices so difficult to suppress .

		A sentence in his first chap - ter , where he speaks of gambling as '' a conscious and deliberate departure from the general aim of civilized society , which is to obtain proper value for its money , '' would seem to indicate , on the writer 's part , a not very exalted conception of '' the general aim '' of civilization .

		The nine colored pictures and the fourteen in black and white are spirited and appear to reflect the manners -LRB- and costumes -RRB- of high society a century and more ago .

		`` The Last American Frontier '' ™ e e Fa n r q wTst ° .

		f -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor
Frederic Logan Paxson	PERSON	of the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, tells the story of the westward movement , chiefly from
1821	DATE	to
1885	DATE	, in the settlement of our great trans-Mississippi domain . ''

		The last frontier '' referred to in the title may be indicated by a line running nearly north and south through Kansas
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		281 City .

		Here , at the bend in the
Missouri River	LOCATION	, which had thus far furnished a water highway toward the sunset , the westward movement was stayed for a while .

		The author gives the history of various over - land trails , of Indian wars and the government 's treatment of the dispossessed redskins , of the for - mation of new territories , and of the final triumph of the railway over this seemingly impossible stretch of desert and mountain .

		The significance of the frontier in American history was the subject of a paper by Professor
Frederick J. Turner	PERSON	, in the `` Annual Report of the American Historical Asso - ciation '' for
1893	DATE	; and this the author of the book under review notes as containing `` the fundamental ideas upon which all recent careful work in western history has been based . ''

		No full history of the trans -
Mississippi	LOCATION	region has yet been written ; but Mr.
Paxson	PERSON	, while modestly calling his own volume a `` sketch , '' expresses in his preface the hope that before many years he may be able '' to exploit in a larger and more elaborate form the mass of detailed information '' upon which `` The Last American Frontier '' is based .

		That the sources for such a work are by no means scanty is made clear in an appended note of six fine-print pages .

		Illustrations and maps have been judiciously introduced , and an index is added .

		The book is emphatically a careful and scholarly piece of work .

		Lore and legend A painstaking piece of hagiology has of
England	LOCATION	's been executed by Mrs.
Henry Hulst	PERSON	patron saint .

		-LRB-
Cornelia Steketee Hulst	PERSON	-RRB- in her ''
St. George of Cappadocia	LOCATION	in Legend and History '' -LRB-
David Nutt	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The origin of what may be called the
St. George	ORGANIZATION	myth is lost in the haze of Aryan legend .

		The story is now regarded by cer - tain scholars versed in such matters as an Aryan myth capable of a solar interpretation .

		But what - ever its origin , and however important or unimpor - tant to trace the dragon-slayer back to the very first mind that conceived his popularly attractive attri - butes , Mrs.
Hulst	PERSON	has collected all that need concern most of us in regard to this legendary hero and saint .

		The common version of the story as accepted by the Roman church is first examined , then the version sanctioned by the Greek church ; and then some account is given of the spread of the worship of
St. George	ORGANIZATION	and of his influence , and the further evolution of the legend in allegory and romance .

		From the Persian legend of Mithra to a cartoon in `` Lustige Blatter '' entitled `` St. Teddy in Combat with the Dollar Dragon '' is a long journey ; but Mrs.
Hulst	PERSON	has accomplished it , and has enlivened the account of her progress with numerous pictures from many sources .

		In her concluding list of references -- a hundred and twenty authorities are cited in the body of the book -- one fails to find the Byzantine hagi - ologist Metaphrastes , whose account of
St. George	ORGANIZATION	is substantially the one adopted in the Roman `` Acta Sanctorum . ''

		The work is , nevertheless , a triumph of diligence .

		It is very attractively executed in its mechanical features .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		A Mother 's List of Books for Children , '' compiled by Mrs.
Gertrude Weld Arnold	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the revision of a privately - printed publication , which the compiler first prepared for use in her own home . ''

		The endeavor has been made to choose those fairy tales which are most free from horrible happenings , and to omit all writings which tolerate unkindness to animals . ''

		Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	writes an introduction warmly commending the book .

		The titles are annotated , and are grouped according to the ages of their readers -- from two to fourteen .

		The selection is one of the best we have ever seen , and no mother should be without it .

		In a short monograph entitled '' Was
William Shak	PERSON	- spere a Gentleman ? ''

		Mr.
Samuel A. Tannenbaum	PERSON	shows that a coat-of-arms was granted to
John Shak	PERSON	- spere in
1596	DATE	, and that the application in
1599	DATE	was not for an original grant of arms but for permission to impale with the Shakspere arms those of the ancient and noble family of
Arden	LOCATION	.

		Hitherto it has been gen - erally assumed that this second application was for an '' exemplification '' or '' recognition '' of what had been an alleged grant , and that Shakspere used influence to gratify his heraldic ambitions .

		Thereby a blot , if such it may be called , is removed from the Shakspere ` scutcheon , and all 's gules again .

		A monumental one-volume war record has recently been brought to completion in Col.
Frederick H. Dyer	PERSON	's '' Compendium of the War of the Rebellion '' -LRB- Cedar Rapids ,
la.	LOCATION	: Torch Press -RRB- .

		Colonel
Dyer	PERSON	has spent forty years in collecting data , tabulating and arranging it , and revising and correcting his material , until he has produced a compact repository of all essential facts and dates pertaining to the men and military organizations engaged in the war , and the actions , big and little , in which they took part .

		The sources are all official , thus insuring the greatest possible accuracy .

		The arrange - ment is in three parts : Organization -- covering troops furnished , losses , brigade , division , corps , and army formation , commanders ; Action -- covering every battle , engagement , and skirmish , showing troops involved in each , and losses when they were officially reported ; and History -- giving the complete story of the regiments and companies participating in the struggle .

		To the statistician or historian of the Civil War period , the
Compedium	ORGANIZATION	will doubtless prove invaluable ; and as a reference work it will fill a constantly increasing demand .

		`` In English Homes , '' that sumptuous account of English domestic architecture , has now reached its third volume -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mr.
Charles Latham	PERSON	, as before , furnishes an abundance of clear and beautiful photographs , and Mr.
H. Avray	PERSON	Tipping provides the textual comment .

		The period covered is that of
Palla	LOCATION	- dianism , introduced from
Italy	LOCATION	by Leoni , most skilfully practised by
Inigo Jones	PERSON	, and exerting a dominating influence over English architecture up to the time of Sir
William Chambers	PERSON	.

		A comprehensive introduction characterizes the period and gives brief biographical notes of its best-known builders and designers .

		Forty country houses are then depicted , with historical data and as much architectural comment as the merit of each warrants .

		Interior decorations by men like
Gib	ORGANIZATION	- bons ,
Verrio	LOCATION	,
Laguerre	PERSON	, Kent ,
Robert Adam	PERSON	, and Chip - pendale , receive due attention in picture and text .

		BRIEFER MENTION : > 24 THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF '' THE DIAL '' : LETTERS TO THE EDITOR TOPICS IN THE MAY PERIODICALS ... 330 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 330 MARK TWAIN .

		The report of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's death on the
21st of April	DATE	, this time not `` greatly exag - gerated '' but sadly and literally true , was the occasion of heart-felt grief to the entire nation , we may almost say to the whole world .

		No American of our time was more widely known ; no other American writer lately among the liv - ing had endeared himself to so large and cos - mopolitan an audience .

		His life , ended midway in its seventy-fifth year , had been rich in human experience , had fulfilled the season of mellow fruitfulness , and had given literary expression , as few other lives have done , to the qualities of buoyancy and independence so characteristic of the typical American temperament .

		It was also a life which , in its personal aspects , revealed the qualities of manliness and sympathy , was admirable in its public and private relations , and bore with fortitude the buffets of ill-fortune .

		There are tests of character which few men can suffer without some show of weakness ; his char - acter they served only to sweeten and strengthen .

		Mark
Twain	PERSON	's life may be divided into two nearly equal parts .

		Of the first part , which includes his boyhood days , his experiences as a journeyman printer and editor , his brief career as a
Mississippi	LOCATION	pilot , his briefer career as a Confederate soldier , and his adventures in the mining-camps and rude settlements of the West , we have the most vivid of records in his books -- in ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' and '' Huckleberry Finn '' and M Roughing It , '' and in the count - less short stories and sketches which began with '' The Jumping Frog '' and are probably not yet at an end , for only a part of the work which he humorously styles his '' Autobiography '' has been put into print .

		Those early days left him with a fund of recollections upon which his drafts were honored -- as was similarly the case with
Bret Harte	PERSON	-- for long years after the experiences themselves had become old -LRB- although not unhappy -RRB- far off things .

		As the recorder of these phases of pioneer life which he knew at first hand , and of which he almost alone has preserved for us the very form and pressure , we are immeasurably in his debt .

		There are few things that we know as well as what it was to be a boy in a
Missouri	LOCATION	country town , a futile skirmisher in the early days of the Civil War , and a traveller on the lower
Mississippi	LOCATION	, few 306 THE DIAJL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, bygone types that are as real to us as the miners and stage-coach drivers and politicians and bar - room loafers of the untutored West of the mid - century .

		The writings in which these things have been preserved for us are
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's best , be - cause they are his raciest and least self-conscious .

		The next best group of his books is provided by '' The Innocents Abroad , '' '' A Tramp Abroad , '' and '' Following the Equator , '' the three extensive records of unconventional travel .

		Yet in these the touch of sophistication is seen , and becomes progressively pronounced with each succeeding narrative .

		The second is not as good as the first , and the third is distinctly weaker than the second , more artificial in its conception and more forced in its humor .

		When the author transplanted himself to the East for permanent residence in the seventies , he aban - doned the primal sources of his inspiration , and never developed others of comparable import - ance .

		Going farther and farther afield in search of fresh material , he illustrated anew the myth of
Antaeus	ORGANIZATION	, and displayed a pitiable weakness .

		Over some of his later flounderings in the alien elements of literary criticism , history , and met - aphysics , it were best discreetly to draw a veil .

		There was in him a streak of the Philistine which might have remained undetected had he `` kept to his last , '' but which was sharply revealed when he infringed upon the domain of intellectual and scholarly concerns .

		The present is not , however , the best occasion for dwelling upon
Mark Twain	PERSON	's limitations , or for emphasizing the ephemeral character of a considerable part of his work .

		A fair share of that work , at least , stands upon a level so high as to be in no danger of passing out of sight .

		Up to an advanced point in his career , he grew steadily in power and wisdom ; his sympathies became ever broader and deeper , and his expres - sive faculty kept pace with the larger demands that were made upon it .

		From the exuberant journalist who gave us entertainment in his earlier days he developed into something like a sage to whom we came to look no less for counsel than for amusement .

		We learned to detect in his homely speech the movings of a fine spirit , instinct with the nobler promptings of democ - racy , hating shams and ostentatious vulgarity , gentle and gracious in its quieter moods , but fanned to burning indignation when facing some monstrous wickedness , such as the corruption of our political life , or the dastardly act of the American soldier in
the Philippines	LOCATION	who be - trayed his rescuer and shamelessly boasted of the shameful deed , or the infamy of the royal libertine who distilled a fortune from the blood of the miserable natives of the
Congo	LOCATION	.

		Even more than by his strictly literary work , he earned our gratitude for the brave words which he spoke upon such themes as these , words that cleared the moral atmosphere and made us see things in the light of naked truth .

		Nor should we , in our tribute to the man , forget the silent heroism with which he endured loss of fortune in his advancing years , and shouldered the burden of a debt incurred by the rascality of his associates , a debt for which he was only indirectly responsible , and which he might have evaded without serious impairment of his reputation .

		The strenuous labors of the years of lecturing and writing which enabled him to discharge in full the shadowy obligations which he then assumed took their toll of his vitality , but won for him an esteem higher than is ever the reward of the artist alone .

		This action ranks with the similar examples set by Scott and
Curtis	PERSON	; it is one of those shining deeds that reveal the man himself , in contradis - tinction to the works by which most men of creative genius are contented to be known .

		The attitude of criticism toward
Mark Twain	PERSON	as a writer has undergone a slow but complete change during the past thirty years .

		From being thought of simply as a '' funny man , '' of the kin of
Josh Billings	PERSON	and
Artemus Ward	PERSON	, he has gradually come to be recognized as one of our foremost men of letters .

		This is a pro- foundly significant transformation of opinion , and to account for it fully would require a more careful analysis than we here have space to undertake .

		The recognition has been unduly delayed , partly because so much of his output has been utterly unworthy of his best self , and partly because his work in its totality is of so nondescript a character .

		The conventional way to distinction in literature is by the fourfold path of the poem , the play , the novel , and the essay .

		Occasionally , also , an historian compels literary recognition .

		But
Mark Twain	PERSON	was neither a poet nor a playwright nor an historian .

		He was hardly a novelist , either , for his share in '' The Gilded Age '' does not seriously count , and his work in the form of fiction is not remarkable as story-telling pure and simple .

		If we are to group him at all , it must be with the essayists , using that term elastically enough to include with him our own Irving , and such Englishmen as Swift and Carry le .

		We must either do this , or fall back upon the sui generis solution of the problem .

		Again , if we make a subdivision of the essayist class for the humor -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJj 307 ists alone , we encounter the difficulty offered by our obstinate association of that term with mere fun-making and the appeal to the lighter inter - ests of human nature .

		Obviously , our subdi - vision must take yet another step , and admit that , on the one hand , there are humorists who make us laugh and have hardly any other influence over us , and humorists who are also creative artists , and critics of life in the deeper sense , and social philosophers whose judgments are of weight and import .

		If we are to classify
Mark Twain	PERSON	at all , it must be with the latter distinguished company ; and his title to kinship with the three English writers above mentioned , and even with such alien prototypes as
Aristo	ORGANIZATION	- phanes and Rabelais and
Cervantes	PERSON	, is at least not scornfully to be put aside .

		THE INTERREGNUM IN AMERICAN LITERATURE .

		BJORNSTJE RNE
BJORNSON	PERSON	The survivor of the Norwegian Dioscuri -- if a classical similitude be permissible in the case of two such sturdy Goths as
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Bjornson	PERSON	-- closed his eyes in
Paris	LOCATION	on the
26th of April	DATE	.

		His death - bed was surrounded by the members of his family , and he passed peacefully away after an illness of many months .

		A less vigorous frame would not have gone through the crisis of
last February	DATE	, when his death was hourly expected .

		At that time , the critical journals of the world -LRB- The Dial included -RRB- paid their respects to his fame , and he bad the unusual experience of living to read -LRB- if he cared for such entertainment -RRB- an extensive collection of what were , to all intents and purposes , his obitu - ary tributes .

		His life was continued well along into his seventy-eighth year ; and few lives have been so worthily lived , or made so helpful to human kind .

		His nation -LRB- become a nation largely through his efforts -RRB- mourns him as it mourned
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, but with a difference ; for he inspired love in no less measure than respect , and was a national figure in a deeper and more intimate sense than was ever his famous compeer .

		And the world mourns with
Norway	LOCATION	, for he has been a figure of cosmopolitan significance since that time in the seventies when his outlook became broadened , and he plunged into the main current of the stream of modern thought .

		Politics , sociology , science , education , and religion , have all been enriched by his activities and his intuitions .

		Yet it is probably as the singer of the people 's songs , and as the artist who portrayed their simple lives and vivified their heroic and legendary past , that his fame will chiefly endure .

		Other ages will have new problems to face , and new prophets will arise to give guidance for their solution ; but the poet of '' Ja , vi elsker '' and '' Over de
Hoje Fjelde	PERSON	, '' the creator of '' SynnOve Solbakken '' and ``
Arne	PERSON	, '' the restorer of
Sigurd Slembe	PERSON	and
Olaf	PERSON	the Holy , is reasonably sure of immortality .

		`` Authors , do not read your contemporaries , '' was the sage advice of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		Authors , do not write about your contemporaries , is perhaps a better counsel , and one which I have tried to follow .

		I used to read my contemporaries religiously , -- and I ought to have had a pension for my efforts in this line .

		But I did not think I could serve them or the public by criticising them , and for a good while I have busied myself with the things which I know are abiding .

		But even to one who sports his oak to the present , a great silence outside may become audible , a great vacancy may make itself felt .

		I suppose everyone is agreed that we have in literature no recognized kings or princes of the blood , no glittering court which fixes all eyes .

		And that we had such regali - ties in the past , powers that were potent in their own day , is also recognized .

		What has come over us ?

		The late
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, master of a magic flute , said , in a letter dated in
1891	DATE	, that for the next twenty years poetry was going to have a hard time in
America	LOCATION	.

		Never was there a truer prophecy .

		But why ?

		The commonly received explanation is the materi - alism of the age , which in turn is due to the great advances in the physical sciences and to the enormous increase in wealth .

		Such explanation leaves me unconvinced .

		Mankind is always , in the main , material -- is chiefly concerned with getting a living and having a good time .

		And other ages have equalled ours in scientific discovery , and , propor - tionally , in wealth .

		No recent material discovery is on the same plane with the finding of
America	LOCATION	and the establishment of the rotundity of the earth .

		No late scientific hypothesis equals the Copernican theory or the law of gravitation .

		No modern inven - tion is so far-reaching in consequences as the inven - tions of printing , of the mariner 's compass , or of gunpowder .

		And in the ages which saw these marvel - lous developments of science and discovery , religion and imagination , literature and art creation , walked abreast of the other activities of man .

		People did not stop going to church , or singing love or festal songs , or recounting the heroic legends of their race , because of
Columbus	LOCATION	or
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	or
Guttenberg	PERSON	, or
Newton	LOCATION	.

		H anything , the achievements of these men stimulated the mind of the world .

		There is perhaps more plausibility in the wealth theory .

		Wealth , really , only respects wealth ; and intellect , really , only respects intellect .

		The person - ages of the two camps do not come together very well .

		And of late the masses , dazzled by money and its uses , have weakened in fealty to intellect and turned their whole worship to the Golden Calf .

		But rich men have often stood by literature and art .

		The traditions of the English aristocracy , for instance , have always been to foster these -- to the extent , at least , of buying books and objects of art .

		And rich nations have often gone art mad .

		The Athenians 308 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, did not become an art people until they acquired the spoils of the Persian War -- until they won the gardens of the
Cyclades	LOCATION	, the commerce of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		No , -- nations like individuals must be born with certain faculties or tendencies .

		`` What is the best way to become beautiful ? ''

		asked a young girl of her doctor . ''

		Well , my dear , the best way I know is to be born pretty . ''

		Perhaps
America	LOCATION	was behind the door when the fatal gift of beauty was given out .

		But these are large considerations , and may be tossed about in a good many ways .

		It is better to come down to the actually appraisable tendencies and influences that have made for what at least seems to be a period of comparative dulness and poverty in American literature .

		The preaching and practice of the dogmas of realism may account for some part of our weakness .

		I have never been able to attach much importance to the fanciful labels of classic , romantic , realistic , symbolic , and the like , which writers give them - selves and fight for .

		There is a real distinction between the different forms of literature , between tragedy and comedy , the novel and the play , narra - tive and lyric poetry .

		But all literature is based on human nature , on the spectacle of the world , on the thoughts and dreams of men .

		The reports of these things differ according to the talents of the authors , but not by any set formulas .

		The Agamemnon is just as real as the last novel founded on the same theme of the unfaithful wife .

		So while our doctri - naires have filled our ears with the fury of their words , I do not believe they have done much harm beyond withdrawing writers too much from what
Rossetti	PERSON	called '' fundamental brain-work '' and mak - ing them trust too much to observation .

		Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, in her Autobiography , says that when she first played Ophelia she went to the madhouse for models .

		But she found that she had to imagine first and observe afterwards .

		That , I judge , is really the law of all art .

		You must know what you want to do , and then take from nature the materials for doing it .

		A more important cause for our comparative failure in pure literature is the American appetite for the didactic .

		Other and perhaps sounder nations are content to take part of their instruction in life from art , to absorb it from the examples in great literature .

		But with us nothing will do but the direct hortatory word .

		Dean Swift left his money to the Irish people to found a madhouse , -- '' To prove by one satiric touch No nation needed it so much . ''

		Possibly American authors have expended the exchequer of their intellects on the didactic , for a similar reason .

		Everyone preaches in
America	LOCATION	-- our Presidents , the presidents of our colleges , maga - zine editors , and so on down the line .

		No wonder the clergy are overslaughed .

		They do n't get half a chance .

		The word is taken from their mouths .

		Now the critic would be a fool indeed who would decry the province and power of the didactic in literature , or deny the nobility and usefulness of the works it has brought forth .

		Two poets so important and opposed as Pope and
Wordsworth	PERSON	are liege subjects of the
Lord of Didacticism	ORGANIZATION	.

		And our own
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	holds his titles from the same hand .

		To me it seems , however , that all these men are takers of second prizes .

		In pure literature , didacticism should be the sauce , not the piece de resistance .

		The business of literature of the central type is to depict life -- life real , great , grotesque , charming , ridiculous ; life ideal , noble , and beautiful .

		And an overplus of moralizing spoils both the truth and beauty of the picture .

		Men of letters can afford to leave the direct preaching and enforcement of morals to the clergy , who are trained and paid to do such work .

		If Beauty is the beginning of literature , tragedy is its culmination .

		It is certain that we do not love tragedy to-day in
America	LOCATION	.

		We put it aside as something black and unpleasant and intruding , like cockroaches or the cimex lectutarius .

		That we had the feeling for it , the stern joy in it , in the past , is also sure .

		We read and applauded our great writers who explored the heights and abysses of human nature , who faced all the horrors and deaths of spirit and body , and rose above them , winged , ex - alted , victorious .

		As long as we refuse to deal with such losses and gains of life , we doom our literature to mediocrity .

		Some of our critics explain our deficiency in great - ness by the irreverence of our minds , by the lowness and vulgarity of our humor .

		Now I do not think our humor is irreverent enough or low enough or vulgar enough for that .

		Perhaps our humorists have not got it in them ; but more probably they , like Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, do not dare to be as funny as they can .

		Public opinion compels them to be decent .

		Wit can be as genteel as it pleases ; but great humor -- the world-upsetting kind -- can hardly exist with - out grossness .

		It is the foil to the noble side of life , and what is the use of a foil which tries to look as much as possible like its principal .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, Puritan and precisian as he really was , has some coarse though not gross scenes in his Friend - ship 's
Garland	LOCATION	-- and his whole heart went out in critical approval of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	's '' Jolly Beggars '' and the bestialities of
Faust	LOCATION	and Aristophanes .

		He knew what literature was , and always declined to accept dishwater or weak tea as efficient substitutes .

		Of our own men , Irving in the past was not afraid to be low .

		Of course all the great humorists of the world -- Aris - tophanes ,
Boccaccio	PERSON	,
Cervantes	PERSON	,
Rabelais	LOCATION	,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Sterne	PERSON	, Fielding ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Heine	LOCATION	-- have been utterly contemptuous of decency and the proprieties when they wanted to give the reality of the animal side of human life .

		The magazines , -- taking them in full -- have done a good deal to depress the vitality and destroy the originality of our recent literature .

		A novel writer has his direct appeal to the public , but for the poet , essayist , or short-story writer , the maga - zine has been the only path of access .

		This has placed a great power and responsibility in the edi -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 309 tor 's hands .

		But for the most part these miscellanies are commercial undertakings .

		To pay , they must appeal to a wide puhlic ; and to reach this public they must give it what it understands and can appre - ciate .

		There must therefore be an inevitable level - ling down that there may be some uplift .

		I have no doubt that the editors do their best to reconcile lit - erature with an appeal to the masses .

		But their best , a little way off , does not loom large .

		I remem - ber once being shut up alone in a house with a com - plete set of one of our oldest and most respected magazines .

		It was in a little inn on the top of
Mount Mansfield	LOCATION	; and for several days the fog hung over the mountain , so that I could not get about .

		Never mind , I thought , there is solace within !

		But as I turned over volume after volume of the magazine , and realized the mediocrity of the verses , the dul - ness of the essays , the tameness of the domesticated variety of the short-story , my soul grew dark within me , and I took my chances in the fog outside .

		The late
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	is reported to have said that he edited the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun '' for an audi - ence which was thirteen years old .

		Now my last indictment of our lateliterature is that it has been edited for women , who have been its main readers .

		Women , like the pretty realism which reproduces the everyday facts of their lives .

		With their practical instincts and craving for authority , they approve of didacticism , which seems to them plain good-sense .

		Although playful and witty , they have no great turn for humor , and coarseness disgusts them .

		They are in themselves the best exponents of Beauty , but they are by no manner of means the Beauty worshippers that men are .

		Their plastic sense is naturally weak , and hardly extends beyond an appreciation of pretty gew - gaws ; so that the form , color , picture , music of verse makes little appeal to them .

		What they demand in poetry is sentiment and emotion .

		Tragedy hurts them ; it was the women who fainted when the Eumenides of iEschylus rushed upon the stage .

		They do not see the good of the crimes , horrors , and vio - lence necessary in tragic work .

		Of course these are sweeping charges , and they are open to many excep - tions ; but in the large they are true .

		And certainly men do not want any general reformation in feminine nature in these respects .

		We are fairly content with women as they are .

		But if we are going to relegate altogether to them the reading of books , literature will of course follow the lines suited to their tastes and instincts .

		Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's period of probation is nearly past .

		After its twenty years wandering in the desert , Poetry may at last be coming to the Promised Land .

		In prose there are signs of a leavening and lighten - ing of the vast soggy mass of realism , didacticism , and sentiment .

		Real creative imagination , real humor , real wit , begin to be apparent .

		But Poetry , with its balanced wings of sense and spirit , is the true angel that must move the waters .

		Until we believe in Poetry again , we shall not be saved .

Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The public library 's vast accumulation of trash -- for such , in sober truth , much of our cur - rent literature will hereafter be adjudged to be -- may well give us pause .

		At the recent dedication of the new building of the
Pennsylvania Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	took occasion to utter a warning against the indiscriminate pres - ervation of printed matter . ''

		I venture a confident opinion , '' he declared , `` that the world of scholar - ship would be in no wise appreciably poorer if one - half , and that the larger half , of the printed matter now accumulated in our public libraries could to - morrow be obliterated -- swept clean out of exist - ence . ''

		With a book production yearly increasing , it is no wonder that library buildings designed to serve the needs of a century to come prove inade - quate in a quarter of that time , or even in less .

		Yet who can anticipate the verdict of posterity on our present literary output , and so decide what ought to be kept and what discarded ?

		The now familiar expedient -LRB- urged by Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	-RRB- of providing a storage room or building for at least the temporary deposit of all likely candidates for oblivion , thus relieving the groaning shelves of the book-stack , is worth considering , even though the storage of inac - tive books is far more expensive than their summary destruction .

		The responsibility of deciding , peri - odically , what portion of a library 's possessions should be committed to the flames is obviously greater than most librarians would care to assume .

		But to cull out , now and then , a few authors to be sent to the morgue , there to await a more or less remote posterity 's mandate for their decent burial , would be a less serious matter ; and at any moment a book thus provisionally offered as a prey to dumb forgetfulness could , on second thought , be restored to the warm precincts of the cheerful day and per - haps put once more into lively circulation .

		The whole problem , however , is so serious , so increas - ingly serious , that no off-hand solution of it is pos - sible .

		Happily , like so many other diseases , this bibliothecal congestion will tend to work out its own cure , and it will be some time yet before our library book-stacks actually scrape the sky .

		• • • Over-capitalization in literature -- in the printed page -- is a matter on which a few timely words may be said ; as also a few words on under - capitalization .

		Capitals are a precious asset in the printer 's art , and not to be treated frivolously .

		The reaction against the excessive and unmethodical capitalization of two centuries ago has itself been followed by something of a reaction in favor of the initial capital letter ; and most effective that upper - case bit of type often proves as a mark of emphasis .

		But familiarity breeds contempt , and the reader ceases to be impressed as soon as the sprinkling of capitals turns into a steady down-pour .

		There is one use of the capital letter that has often seemed to us 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, an abuse , though it has excited no general comment .

		In quoting a German word , of the noun-class , why should we feel obliged to conform invariably to the German rule and distinguish the word with a capital ?

		It is well enough to write
Kaiser	PERSON	and
Konigreich	PERSON	and
Vaterland	LOCATION	with large initials if one chooses ; but when it comes to beinkleider and bleistift and tintenfass , they deserve no such distinction at our hands , whatever the practice of the
Teuton	LOCATION	.

		Con - trariwise , merely because the French -LRB- and the library-school graduates -RRB- write their book-titles with only an initial capital , unless proper names occur , why should we discard the old and approved usage of capitals for all nouns and other important words in the title ?

		Excessive economy -- parsimony , in fact -- in the use of upper-case letters has long marked the typography of a leading
New England	LOCATION	newspaper whose reputation is national .

		There is a story that when a new compositor on this paper asked what rule to follow in the use of capitals , he was instructed by a fellow-compositor to confine their use to the founder of Christianity and the founder of the paper .

		The journal in question indulges in such eccentricities as '' Bunker hill , '' ''
Connecticut	LOCATION	river , '' `` New haven railroad company , '' '' Standard oil trust , '' and '' the social democrat party , '' and in a late issue made the surprising statement , '' We have crossed the rubicon . ''

		A small river , in truth , is the Rubicon , but surely of sufficient importance in Roman history to deserve a large initial letter .

		In this matter , as in so many others , there is a reason - able middle way between the extremes of excess and abstinence which the trained taste should find it not hard to follow . ''

		How to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day '' is the effective title of a little book by Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, written some years ago , but practically discovered in
America	LOCATION	in the wake of the recent popularity of '' The Old Wives ' Tale . ''

		Many of the characters in Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's novels are of the type that '' muddle along '' and call it living ; and he understands with peculiar completeness the common - place person 's attitude -LRB- or lack of attitude -RRB- toward life , -- the sleepy , unthinking acquiescence in its conditions , dominated by a wish -- not poignant enough to operate as a motive , but too strong to make real contentment possible -- that he had '' more time '' for the things that count . ''

		More time , '' says Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, is one of a very few things that nobody can get .

		You can neither buy , beg , nor lose your quota of time .

		No matter how shamefully you misuse one hour , another undeviatingly follows .

		The thing to do , then , is to cease wishing for the impos - sible , and to realize that if you work , let us say , eight hours , and sleep seven or eight , you still have eight or nine hours a day in which to live , with mind as well as body .

		In the little book above referred to , and in a similar collection of articles on '' The Reasonable Life , '' Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	makes trenchant suggestions on the vitalizing of dull , purposeless evenings , the utilizing of time spent in getting to and from work , the application to the quickening and development of the mind of the ideas that are rife nowadays about physical culture .

		He proposes no spectacular scheme of self-cultivation ; '' slow and sure '' is his motto .

		But most of his readers will be perplexed indeed to know what becomes of those extra eight or nine hours , and will be inclined to try some of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's simple expedients for filling one or two of them .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's dramatic theme has always been justice to the under dog .

		Recently he has used '' Justice '' as the title of a play which , in grim sim - plicity of motive and action and in utter absence of stage conventions and dramatic `` effects , '' is even less theatrical , if possible , than his three plays that have preceded it .

		The brief is strong just because it makes no pretension to being unassailable .

		Its unfolding has been followed with the tensest interest at the
Repertory Theatre	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, and it is said that Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, after listening atten - tively through a performance , immediately instituted several reforms in prison management suggested by the experiences of the hero ,
Falder	PERSON	, who is '' sent up '' for three years for raising a cheque .

		He does raise the check , his motive being a desire to free a woman friend from the tyranny and abuse of a cruel husband .

		Whether he was at the moment crazed by love and worry , is the legal point at issue ; the vital one being whether the law is justified , -- for the boy 's life is ruined , and incidentally the woman 's , before justice has run its course .

		A fussy old bar - rister 's clerk with a heart furnishes the humor , with - out which this '' slice of life '' would be unbearably grim .

		The very restrained style of the play is hard on the reader -- and on the actor too , at the same time that it furnishes him with his great opportunity .

		The power of the apt phrase can hardly be overestimated .

		The late
Professor Sumner of Yale	ORGANIZATION	declared in his last book that '' an educated man ought to be beyond the reach of suggestion from advertisements , newspapers , speeches , and stories . ''

		Nevertheless , a live man must and will react on his environment , and the seductions of clever adver - tisements , adroit headlines , persuasive speeches , and interesting stories must be resisted if they are not yielded to ; they can not leave an intelligently alert person absolutely indifferent .

		Hence the pow - erful influence exerted by men who can put thoughts that breathe into words that burn .

		How many a man and woman has been moved to the expression , wise or unwise , of righteous indignation by that little phrase of
Burke	PERSON	's '' a limit at which forbearance ceases to be a virtue , '' or has been taught patience by that other phrase of his , '' Custom reconciles us to everything '' !

		`` A wise and salutary neglect '' has been the salvation of many young persons wholly ignorant of their debt to the coiner of the phrase .

		Franklin 's assertion that `` there never was a good war or a bad peace '' has contributed , who knows how much , to international harmony , as his equally
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 famous saying that '' in this world nothing is certain hut death and taxes '' has helped many of us to hear philosophically the vicissitudes of our lot .

		That there is a one best way , or supremely effective way , to state an important truth , who that has picked up a few of the immortal phrases of literature and of proverbial philosophy can doubt ?

		• • • The steady demand for the favorite old books reveals an element of strength and perma - nency that is in encouraging contrast with the insatiate craving for the latest popular novelty in literature .

		Recent investigation has proved that , with the
Bible	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	heading the list of constant sellers .

		Scott -LRB- especially his `` Ivanhoe '' -RRB- ,
Hawthorne	PERSON	-LRB- `` The Scarlet Letter '' first and fore - most -RRB- ,
Thackeray	PERSON	-LRB- `` Vanity Fair '' particularly -RRB- , and
Dickens	PERSON	-LRB- both in '' Pickwick '' and ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' -RRB- , are in large and unflagging demand .


Lew Wallace	PERSON	's • ■ Ben Hur '' still appeals strongly to book-buyers , and is said , perhaps with some exag - geration , to bring in about forty thousand dollars a year to the author 's family .

		Strikingly inferior is the popularity of both his earlier novel ** The Fair God '' and his later effort u The Prince of
India	LOCATION	. ''

		An encouraging symptom is the large public demand for the leading poets ,
Longfellow	LOCATION	outdistancing all competitors in this country , with
Whittier	LOCATION	in second place .

		Tennyson and
Browning	PERSON	also have each a strong following , and the sale of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's '' Omar , '' since the expiration of copyright twenty years ago , has been such as would have struck the modest translator -LRB- or adaptor , rather -RRB- dumb with amazement .

		The possibilities of the ` prentice pen are delightfully unrestricted .

		What new and epoch - making contribution the young writer shall make to literature , it rests with himself to determine .

		A striking proof of the young and unknown author 's power to command attention , and to win sure reward for good work well done , was lately furnished in

		PROFESSOR AGASSIZ AND THE CARNEGIE FUND .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I find on page 264 of your issue of
April 16	DATE	a state - ment in regard to my lifelong friend Dr.
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	, which in justice to him and to the Carnegie Scientific Institution of
Washington	LOCATION	needs to be cor - rected .

		The statement is , in substance , that
Agassiz	PERSON	was offered 875,000 for conducting some deep-sea soundings on condition that the enterprise should be known as the Carnegie-Agassiz Expedition , and that he declined the offer and found the money elsewhere .

		Together with Dr.
John Billings	PERSON	, I spent a night with Mr.
Agassiz	PERSON	and arranged that we should offer him
$ 50,000	MONEY	from the Carnegie Fund to enable us to place several men of science on his exploring vessel , who would carry on researches somewhat different from those in which he expected to be engaged .

		There was no condition made as to the name of the expedition , which was always mentioned in the papers of the Car - negie Scientific Institution as the '' Agassiz Expedition , '' and never had associated with its title even the name
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some time before the expedition started , Mr.
Agassiz	PERSON	made up his mind that he preferred to carry on the expedition without assistance ; and as it was so arranged , we of the Carnegie Institution took no part in his ven - ture .

		It is therefore not true that he was offered 875,000 , and that he promptly declined ; and untrue that any condition as to a name for the enterprise was attached to the offer of assistance .

		The li Hoosier Schoolmaster '' Revealed .

		* Probably nearly every reader of '' The Hoosier Schoolmaster '' -- that pioneer in a school of fic - tion that has had a numerous following , though none of the zealous imitators has yet imperilled the supremacy of the original model -- has been inclined to regard the Schoolmaster 's experiences as the more or less faithful autobiography of the writer .

		It is therefore likely to surprise many readers of Mr.
George Cary Eggleston	PERSON	's ''
Recol	PERSON	- lections of a Varied Life '' to learn that not Edward , but his younger brother George , the author of these '' Recollections , '' was the School - master so well depicted in the novel .

		Edward
Eggleston	PERSON	's feebleness of health debarred him from active pursuits and constrained him to turn , not unwillingly , to his pen as a means of sup - port ; and it was his brother 's pedagogic diffi - culties and triumphs at
Riker 's Ridge	ORGANIZATION	, in
Indiana	LOCATION	, that appealed to the novelist 's fancy , and at a critical moment rescued from failure and bankruptcy that excellent old story-paper , '' Hearth and Home . ''

		Sundry homely details characteristic of Hoosier life in the fifties , told with the convincing force of actual experience , are now added to the necessarily embroidered account of that life as given in the story .

		Mr.
George Cary Eggleston	PERSON	calls himself , near the close of his volume , '' an extempora - neous writer '' -- the sort of writer developed by the stress and strain of metropolitan jour - nalism ; and his brisk narrative has all the excellences , and not many of the defects , of the trained journalist .

		The reader is spared all introductory or genealogical matter , and all that is of a family nature or of interest chiefly to the writer himself .

		Plunging into the midst of things , Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	tells us , rapidly and effectively , what sort of a life he has led since his birth at
Vevay	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, seventy years ago , and what kind of persons , celebrated or obscure , he has had intercourse with in his varied , and , for a man of letters , rather eventful , course .

		His family is of
Virginia	LOCATION	extraction , and in the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	he himself passed a few of his adolescent years and received the latter part of his academic training .

		His enthusiasm for things and persons Virginian , well known to readers of his romances , finds additional warm expression in these retrospections , wherein also * Recollections of a Varied Life .

		By
George Cary Eggleston	PERSON	.

		New York :
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		he not unnaturally deplores the passing of the old order , the displacement of the Southern planter by the Yankee farmer , and the invasion of the cotton-mill and all the unloveliness of factory life where once were to be enjoyed the courtliness and the leisure of the broad-acred
Virginia	LOCATION	plantation .

		So warmly did the young
Eggleston	PERSON	espouse the cause of his adopted State that when the Civil War broke out there seems not to have been the slightest hesitation on his part which side of the quarrel to make his own .

		Enlisting early and serving to the end , the young caval - ryman evidently found his life in the field much to his taste ; at least he treats us to very little of the horrors of war , but to not a few agree - able pictures of the freedom and adventure he enjoyed during those four years of campaigning .

		Of his life in general in the South , and of the peculiar virtues of Southerners , he has much to say which , in its warmth of eulogy , taxes the reader 's credulity .

		But he earnestly protests that he is not exaggerating , and it is certainly far pleasanter to believe than to doubt him .

		He must , however , have been placed in somewhat exceptional surroundings if one may judge from such passages as the following . ''

		Both the young men and the young women read voluminously -- the young men in part , perhaps , to equip themselves for conversational intercourse with the young women They hoth read polite literature , but they read history also with a diligence that equipped them with independent convictions of their own , with regard to such matters as the conduct of
Charlotte Corday	LOCATION	, the characters of
Mirabeau	LOCATION	,
Danton	PERSON	, and
Robespierre	LOCATION	, the ungentlemanly treatment given by
John Knox	PERSON	to
Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	, and all that sort of thing .

		Indeed , among the
Virginia	LOCATION	women , young and old , the romantic episodes of history , ancient , mediaeval , and modern , completely took the place , as subjects of conversation , of those gossipy personalities that make up the staple of conversation among women generally . ''

		Soon after the close of the war , young Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	removed to
Illinois	LOCATION	, and thence to
Mississippi	LOCATION	, where he began and ended his brief and unstimulating experience of the law as a profession .

		Forsaking this , `` in the profoundest disgust , '' for journalism , and for literature in a wider sense , he betook himself , with wife and child , to
New York	LOCATION	and secured work as a reporter on the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	'' Union , '' of which
Theodore Tilton	PERSON	was then editor , having recently left `` The Independent . ''

		The enterprise and what he himself calls the '' cheek '' of the would-be journalist are illustrated by his very first con - tribution to his newspaper .

		While waiting for his first assignment he wrote an article and sent it in to Mr.
Tilton	PERSON	, who liked it and printed it

		THE DIAL 313 as a `` leader . ''

		Throughout Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	's '' varied life , '' he has manifestly had a happy faculty for landing always on his feet and for makinsr a success of whatever he has undertaken .

		He says of himself that he has always been '' intensely in earnest , '' and that may help to explain his unfailing effectiveness in any activity claiming his attention .

		Among the many famous men , chiefly men of letters , with whom Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	has had deal - ings , professional or friendly ,
Bryant	PERSON	is one whom we are glad to be made better acquainted with from the personal anecdotes of the great editor 's assistant on the `` Evening Post . ''

		Con - troverting
Lowell	PERSON	's commonly-accepted descrip - tion of him in '' A Fable for Critics , '' where he appears as cold and unresponsive by nature , Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	says : '' The lack of warmth usually attributed to Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	I found to be nothing more than the personal reserve common to
New Englanders	LOCATION	of culture and refinement , plus an excessive personal modesty and a shyness of self-revelation and self-intrusion which is usually found only in young girls just budding into womanhood .

		Mr.
Bryant	PERSON	shrank from self-assertion even of the most impersonal sort , as I never knew any other human being to do .

		He cherished his own opin - ions strongly , but he thrust them upon nobody .

		His dignity was precious to him , but his only way of assert - ing it was by withdrawal from any conversation or com - pany that trespassed upon it .

		Above all , emotion was a sacred thing , not to be exploited or even revealed .

		In ordinary intercourse with his fellow-men he hid it away as one instinctively hides the privacies of the toilet .

		He could no more lay his feelings bare to common scrutiny than he could have taken his bath in the presence of company .

		In the intimate talks he and I had together during the last half-dozen years of his life , he laid aside bis reserve , so far as it was possible for a man of his sensitive nature to do , and I found him not only warm in his human sympathies , but even passionate . ''

		Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	's long experience as literary editor gives weight to his opinion in matters of literary ethics .

		His judgment concerning anonymity in literary criticism is apparently reflected in what he quotes from
Bryant	PERSON	under this head . ''

		I regard an anonymous literary criticism , '' said the poet on one occasion to Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	, `` as a thing quite as despicable , unmanly , and cowardly as an anonymous letter .

		It is something that no honorable man should write , and no honorably conducted newspaper should publish . ''

		It is true that most of the reviews in the `` Post '' were unsigned in
Bryant	PERSON	's day -LRB- as now -RRB- , but he maintained that in letting it be generally known who was the literary editor of that journal he had removed the stigma of anonymity from them .

		As Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	devotes most of his chap - ters to those early days of young hope and boundless possibilities with which he entered on his life-work , there is no lack of stimulus and freshness in his pages .

		In writing his first book , a manual entitled '' How to Educate Yourself , '' for '' Putnam 's Handy Book Series , '' he says that he had the advantage of comparative youth and of that self-confident omniscience which only youth can have . ''

		I knew everything then , '' he continues , '' better than I know any - thing now , so much better , indeed , that for a score of years past I have not dared open the little book , lest it rebuke my present ignorance beyond my capacity to endure . ''

		The account of his early good-fortune in being solicited to write '' A Rebel 's Recollections '' for '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' and of the genesis of various other works from his pen , with the record of his busy life as a journalist in
New York	LOCATION	, is full of interest .

		The chapters are short , and the reader 's attention is gladly given to their brisk recital of incident and anecdote .

		The writer 's brief closing description of his working habits is likely to be of help to young followers of lit - erature or journalism .

		The '' extemporaneous '' element in the book , while freeing it from any evidence of labor , any smell of the lamp , betrays itself less admirably in an occasional mark of carelessness , as in the use of compte as the French form of count , and in the neither French nor English seigniors .

		There are no pictures in the volume , not even a frontispiece portrait of the author .

		Something of
Bryant	PERSON	's '' shyness of self - revelation and self - intrusion '' has indeed been shown by Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	in this respect as in others ; and who shall say his book is not all the better for it ?


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Some English Romantic Poets .

		* Current essays in literary criticism are numer - ous enough , but it is a rare volume which really takes its readers further along than they were before .

		It is therefore with pleasure that we take account of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's sub - stantial volume of criticism on certain British poets who in their time contributed to the modern development of natural feeling and the feeling for nature in English poetry .

		It is a book over which the discerning reader will felicitate himself as he reads , and the literary student -- even though a critic -- grow decor - ously enthusiastic as he writes .

		There are , of course , spots upon which criti - * The Romjlntic Movement ix Exglish Poetbt .

		By
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		New York :
E. P. Dutton	PERSON	and
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, cism may light .

		There is , first of all , a disap - pointment in store for those who take the volume in hand with expectations naturally aroused by the title .

		The book is not a treatise upon the Romantic Movement at all .

		In his preface the author explains that he does not use the term in its usual historical sense .

		There is , from his point of view , nothing in this development of English poetry so definite as a conscious '' move - ment . ''

		In the
Tractarian Movement	ORGANIZATION	, for exam - ple , there was a definite aim which set many minds working together . ''

		No such thing ever happened in the creation of literature . ''

		These romanticists among the poets were comrades , to be sure , but not colleagues ; they should there - fore be studied as individuals .

		And so in the bulk of the volume we find a collection of criti - cal estimates in which some eighty or ninety versifiers are considered in chronological order , and in which a valuation is placed upon their work .

		A brief Introduction , of less than twenty pages , contains all that Mr.
Symons	PERSON	cares to say about what we usually term the Romantic Movement ; and here he defines the phrase as meaning '' simply the reawakening of the imag - ination , a reawakening to a sense of beauty and strangeness in natural things , and in all the im - pulses of the mind and senses .

		That reawaken - ing was not always a conscious one . ''

		Nor will the plan of selection adopted by the critic in his choice of poets for consideration com - mend itself to everyone .

		No method of limitation could be more arbitrary .

		The year 1800 is fixed upon as a centre for Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's chronological compasses , and the sweep of his instrument in - cludes all the romantic poets who , born previous to that year , survived it .

		As fate arranged , there - fore , it is John Home -LRB- 1722-1808 -RRB- who heads the list of these romanticists , since he chanced to be the oldest British versifier who survived the century ; and it is Thomas Hood -LRB- 1799-1845 -RRB- who closes the list , because , apparently , no other romantic poet claims the closing year of the century as that of his birth .

		However , it is for Mr.
Symons	PERSON	to write of whom he pleases , and it is hardly worth while to quarrel with him for thus excluding from his pages the earlier leaders in the movement -- Gray ,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, and
Burns	PERSON	.

		Of
Burns	PERSON	, to be sure , the author does have a few suggestive words to say in his Introduction , but he gives no adequate study of the Scotch poet .

		Quibbling aside , there is abundance of inter - esting material in these pages .

		It is worth while , perhaps , just to have one 's memory refreshed regarding the significance of those half - forgotten if not altogether unknown names .

		Who was
John Home	PERSON	, for example ?

		Little of his work has survived his own day , yet two lines in his play of ''
Douglas	PERSON	'' were familiar to us when we were schoolboys : '' My name is
Norval	LOCATION	; on the
Grampion Hills	LOCATION	My father feeds his flocks ; a frugal swain . ''

		And here appears Dr.
Erasmus Darwin	PERSON	-LRB-
1731	DATE	-
1802	DATE	-RRB- , physician , natural philosopher , and didac - tic poet , the distinguished grandsire of the more distinguished Charles ; with his '' Loves of the Plants '' and his '' Temple of Nature , '' in whom Imagination mated with Science , producing some strange results .

		Describing a statue of Lot 's wife in the salt-mines of
Cracow	LOCATION	, he notes : '' Cold dews condense upon her pearly breast , And the big tear rolls lucid down her vest . ''


John Wolcott	PERSON	-LRB- 1735-1803 -RRB- follows , more easily recognized under the pen-name of '' Peter Pindar '' -- with his '' desultory way of writing , A hop and step and jump way of inditing . ''


William Combe	PERSON	-LRB- 1741-1823 -RRB- is another writer whose name rests upon the memory with less weight than that of '' Dr. Syntax , '' the pseu - donym under which he wrote .

		It now occurs to us that in our youth we curiously studied over two or three volumes of Dr. Syntax 's '' Tours , '' but it is a surprise to learn that this gentleman was the author of some eighty publi - cations , of which none has really survived .

		If the names already cited are unfamiliar , those of a little group of women contemporary with these men are still alive .

		Here are Mrs.
Barbauld	PERSON	and
Joanna Baillie	PERSON	; and
Hannah More	PERSON	, of pious memory , whose sacred dramas , we are assured , are '' still readable on a dull afternoon . ''

		It may well be that few now read the verses which these ladies wrote ; but this can hardly be said of
Carolina	LOCATION	, Lady
Nairne	PERSON	-LRB-
1766	DATE	-
1845	DATE	-RRB- , whose lilting songs -- `` The Laird of Cockpen , '' '' Caller
Herrin	PERSON	' , '' and `` The Land o ' the Leal '' -- make their appeal to-day as freshly as when first written .

		It was
Lady Nairne	PERSON	, by the way , whose '' admiration of Burns showed itself in the desire to publish a ' purified ' edition of his songs '' ; but whose practical good sense led her to see that some of the ploughman 's best poems `` would n't be purified , '' and finally to abandon the scheme .

		There is an interesting note upon the two sisters ,
Ann	PERSON	and
Jane Taylor	PERSON	, joint authors of `` Twinkle , Twinkle , Little Star , '' which contains the following comment .

		It will strike an American ear oddly enough . ''

		The talents of
Jane	PERSON	were more considerable than those of
Ann	PERSON	.

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 315 There is not much space for personal history in these severely condensed paragraphs of critical comment , but Mr.
Symons	PERSON	has found room here and there for a few details .

		The reader is often touched by their pathos .

		There was
Robert Bloomfield	PERSON	, a country boy , and afterward a tailor in a
London	LOCATION	garret .

		There he wrote rural tales , ballads , and nature poems ; thirty thousand copies of '' The Farmer 's Boy '' were sold in three years ; he was lionized and patronized , and then left to die in poverty . ''

		Had he lived longer he would probably have gone mad . ''


Robert Tannahill	PERSON	worked at a loom in
Paisley	LOCATION	all his life , making his songs as he worked , like
Hans Sachs	PERSON	on his cobbler 's bench .

		He went `` melancholy-mad , '' burned his manuscripts , and drowned himself in the river .


George Beattie	PERSON	, the crofter 's son , who wrote much about '' grisly ghaists '' and u whinnering goblins , '' shot himself because of disappointment in love .

		On the other hand , there was the experience of
William Nicholson	PERSON	, son of a Galloway carrier , who be - came a peddler , printed his own poems and took them about in his pack .

		M He went to fairs as singer and piper ; then took to drink , and a new gospel which he wanted to preach to the
King	LOCATION	; but .

		coming back unsatisfied , became a drover . ''

		Most romantic of all , perhaps , was the career of
James Hogg	PERSON	, M the
Ettrick Shepherd	PERSON	, '' who began at seven by herding cows on the hills of Selkirk .

		At twenty he could not write the alphabet : but at twenty-six he began to make up verses in his head .

		Having heard ''
Tarn O'Shanter	PERSON	'' recited by a half - daft person , he resolved to be a poet and to fill
Burns	ORGANIZATION	's place in the world .

		And he did become a poet -- a poet of such pretensions that Mr.
Symons	PERSON	de - votes ten pages of comment to his work .

		The general reader of this book will turn with natural interest to those sections which deal with the greater poets --
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Cole	PERSON	- ridge ,
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	.

		And here Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's critical strength is most forcibly recog - nized .

		His discussion of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetical quality is one of the best that has been written . ''

		Sincerity was at the root of all
Wordsworth	PERSON	's merits and defects ; it gave him his unapproachable fidelity to nature ; and also his intolerable fidelity to his own whims .

		Like
Emerson	PERSON	, whom he so often resembled , he respected all intuitions ; but , unlike
Emerson	PERSON	, did not always distinguish between a whim and an intuition . ''

		Such is the critic 's point of view as indicated at the beginning of the section .

		In his criticism of individual poems , therefore , he consistently deprecates the w Laodamia '' as `` an attempt to be classic . '' ''

		Here
Wordsworth	PERSON	would be Greek as the Greeks were , or rather as they seem to us , at our distance from them , to be ; and it is only in single lines that he suc - ceeds , all the rest of the poem showing an effort to be something not himself .

		Thus this profoundly natural poet becomes for once , as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	has noted , ' artificial ' in a poem which has been classed among his masterpieces . ''

		It is interesting to find that Mr.
Symons	PERSON	him - self considers `` The Leech-Gatherer '' -LRB- or `` Reso - lution and Independence '' -RRB- to be
Wordsworth	PERSON	's '' greatest , as it is certainly his most charac - teristic , '' poem .

		This assertion , while perhaps unconventional , is altogether consistent , and to many a lover of that realistic , homely , yet eloquent parable , it is exceedingly gratifying .

		Ideally characteristic of the poet this composi - tion surely is ; among the compositions typical of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, which other is more admirable than this ?

		Of Scott , the critic says : '' The novelist died ... in
1825	DATE	; but the poet committed suicide , with
Harold the Dauntless	PERSON	, in
1817	DATE	. ''

		For Sir
Walter	PERSON	's poetry he has no admiration and scant patience . ''

		Scott 's verse -LSB- his long poems -RSB- is written for boys , and boys , generation after generation , will love it with the same freshness of response ... Byron usually fol - lows Scott in the boy 's head , and drives out Scott , as that infinitely greater , though imperfect , force may well do .

		Shelley often completes the disillusion .

		But it is well , perhaps , that there should be a poet for boys , and for those grown-up people who are most like boys ; for those , that is , to whom poetry appeals by something in it which is not the poetry . ''

		Byron , he declares '' has power without wisdom , power which is sanity , and human at heart , but without that vision which is wisdom . ''

		Byron 's ennui `` was made up of many elements , but it was partly of that most incurable kind which comes from emptiness rather than over-fulness ; the ennui of one to whom thought was not sat - isfying , without sustenance in itself , but itself a cause of restlessness , like a heady wine drunk in solitude . ''

		In writing of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Symons	PERSON	says : '' There are two kinds of imagination , that which embodies and that which disembodies .

		Shelley 's is that which disembodies , filling mortal things with unearthly essences or veiling them with unearthly raiment .

		Words - worth 's imagination embodies , concentrating spirit into man , and nature into a wild flower . ''

		Keats is described as the artist `` to whom art is more than life , and who , if he realises that 4 Beauty is Truth ,
Truth Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, ' loves truth for being beautiful and not beauty for its inner - most soul of spiritual truth . ''

		These passages are fairly illustrative of our author 's critical attitude .

		His comments are 316 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, incisive , sound , and stimulating .

		Originality of view and definiteness of judgment are stamped on every dictum .

		It is not necessary to add that Mr.
Symons	PERSON	writes with the pen of a literary artist , but it is proper to say that half the pleasure derived from the book is due to this fact .

		Felicitous phrases and terse epigrams brighten the paragraphs and illuminate the criticism . ''

		Thus , Setebos , storming because Mephistopheles Gave him the lie , Said he 'd ' blacken his eye , ' And dashed in his face a whole cup of hot coffee-lees . ''

		This illustrates what Mr.
Symons	PERSON	terms the '' cascading of cadences '' in '' The Ingoldsby Legends . ''

		In describing the songs of
Tanna	PERSON	- hill , he speaks of '' that almost inarticulate jingle and twinkle which goes with the genuine gallop of the Scottish tongue . '' ''

		Pope , '' he says , '' is the most finished artist in prose who ever wrote in verse . ''

		Again : '' Where other poets use reality as a spring-board into space ,
Blake	PERSON	uses it as a foothold on his return from flight . ''

		This is indeed a book which reflects the posi - tive personality of a brilliant mind .

		It is not without eccentricities of opinion , nor are its judgments infallible ; but it is a volume thor - oughly worth while .

		It really takes its reader further on .

		* In
1900	DATE	appeared the introductory part of the first volume of the original German edition of
Hugo De Vries	ORGANIZATION	's mutationstheorie .

		This work has recently been translated into English with the title , '' The Mutation Theory : Experiments and Observations on the
Origin of Species	ORGANIZATION	in the
Vegetable Kingdom	LOCATION	. ''

		Volume I. , '' The Origin of Species by Mutation , '' has already been issued .

		If not epoch-making , this work in the original edition was at least epoch-marking .

		In conjunction with the then recently rediscov - ered work of the Austrian monk ,
Gregor Mendel	PERSON	, regarding the method by which characters are inherited , the ideas of De Vries served to stimu - late investigators all over the world to undertake experimental studies of the basic problems of organic evolution .

		Volume I. ,
Origin of Species by Mutation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Chicago :
The Open Court Pubhshing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		approached the
last decade	DATE	in respect to the quantity of reliable experimental data collected regarding the factors of evolution and their operation .

		The Darwinian and neo-Darwinian schools of evolutionary thought , in the very na - ture of the case , did not stimulate experimental lines of investigation .

		Their teaching was that the progressive changes of organic structure and function which we call evolution are things which proceed by the slow and gradual accumulation of exceedingly minute variations by a process of natural selection .

		But if it takes centuries to make any definite progress in evolution , what chance might a graduate student yearning for a doctorate , or a university instructor struggling for an increase in salary and rank , be supposed to have of getting anywhere in an experimental study of evolution ?

		Vita brevis est ; and one was much surer of `` results '' by embarking upon a speculative discussion of the relation of exist - ing animals and plants to hypothetical primitive forms , assumed to have been acted upon by a hypothetical environment , or some similar sub - ject .

		To De Vries , perhaps more than to any other man , is due the credit of having brought about an entire change of the prevailing viewpoint in regard to the study of evolution .

		He saw clearly that the only way to get the investigation of evolution out of the slough of metaphysical despond in which it had so long floundered was precisely by the application of the experimental method to its problems .

		Through a long period of years he carried on a most brilliant and thor - ough experimental investigation aimed at the determination of how new varieties and species are as a matter of fact actually produced .

		The results of this investigation are embodied in the book under review .

		It is a substantial and enduring work of reference , rather than a popu - lar treatise .

		Its place in the library is beside
Darwin	PERSON	's `` Origin '' and '' Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication . ''

		The first volume of '' The Mutation Theory '' is divided into two parts .

		The first part is occu - pied with a critical review of current theories of evolution , particularly those relating to the effect of selection .

		This is followed by a pre - sentation of the author 's theory of the origin of species by mutation .

		Part II .

		contains the detailed account of De Vries 's experiments and observations regarding the production of new elementary species in the evening primrose -LCB- Oenothera -RRB- .

		It is contended that evolution in general has proceeded by such dis - continuous steps , rather than by the gradual accumulation of minute variations .

		De Vries makes no denial of the importance of natural selection , but believes that its chief function is not to create , but rather to determine which mutations shall survive in the struggle for exis - tence .

		The limitations of the
Mutation Theory	ORGANIZATION	as a general theory of Evolution must be settled by future investigation ; but there can be no doubt that this masterly work of De Vries 's will long rank as a classic of biological literature .

		Ax American Soldier axd Mystic * A remarkable character is revealed in the
Diary of General Ethan Allen Hitchcock	ORGANIZATION	, extracts from which have been edited by the veteran author and journalist
W. A. Croffut	PERSON	, and published under the title '' Fifty Years in Camp and Field . ''

		The Diary covers almost the whole of the active life of
General Hitch	ORGANIZATION	- cock .

		It was begun soon after his graduation from West Point in
1817	DATE	, and the last entry was made more than
fifty years later	DATE	.

		It gives information upon
Hitchcock	PERSON	's life while in - structor and commandant at
West Point	LOCATION	, where he trained many of the prominent Civil War generals ; upon his services on the Western frontier , in the
Seminole Wars	ORGANIZATION	in
Florida	LOCATION	, and in the Mexican and
Civil Wars	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is not only a source of information about Hitch - cock himself , but a side-light thrown upon the public matters and policies of the time .

		The editor tells us that the hundreds of volumes of the Diary are filled mainly with
Hitchcock	PERSON	's notes on his reading and with his own philo - sophical reflections , while only slight space is given to the details of his army life .

		However , somewhat more is said in the Diary about public questions of the day .

		In selecting material for publication the editor has omitted all except the most striking of the philosophical reflections , and has printed the more interesting personal notes and the comments on public matters and men .

		The Diary discloses an interesting character -- a soldier well read in all the branches of litera - * Fifty Years r > - Camp axd Field .

		Diary of Major -
General Ethan Allen Hitchcock	ORGANIZATION	.

		U.S.A. Edited by
W. A. Croffut	PERSON	.

		Ph.D. .

		New York :
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		ture , philosophy , and science ; a scholar who was an accomplished military organizer and execu - tive ; a philosopher of inquisitive mind , who , while he sat in courts-martial , inspected armies , or commanded districts , '' took more pleasure in the infinite than in the finite , in metaphysics than in physics , in the occult than in the obvious . ''

		But it was chiefly as a soldier that the world knew General
Hitchcock	PERSON	.

		He tells us that he went into the military profession , not because he was attracted to it , but because his people thought it to be the proper vocation for the grandson of the hero of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	.

		Yet he was one of the most accomplished of American soldiers , as the positions held by him indicate .

		And probably no other good soldier was ever quite so independent in speech and with pen , so nearly insubordinate at times .

		The entries in the Diary show that he was a frequent '' protest - ant '' against the rulings or policies of command - ing officers , of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	, and of the President .

		And his protests were usually effec - tive .

		At times he must have been very trouble - some .

		The Diary mentions a dozen instances of issues between
Hitchcock	PERSON	and some superior authority .

		He was sent by the West Point authorities to protest against President
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	's interference with the discipline of cadets , and he roundly scolded u Old Hickory . ''

		He openly said that the Seminole Indians were cruelly treated , defrauded , and lied to by the government officials , and insisted that only a policy of conciliation would succeed in pacifying
Florida	LOCATION	, that he '' never did believe in
Harney	PERSON	's method of dealing with Indians -- to hang them wherever they were found -- but in friendly over - tures . ''

		In
Florida	LOCATION	he was finally given leave to try his plan ; and it succeeded .

		In the West he made much trouble for the politicians , but saved the Winnebagoes and the Cherokees from being defrauded and despoiled .

		General
Hitchcock	PERSON	read aright the signs of American expansion in the
Southwest	LOCATION	.

		As early as
1836	DATE	he predicted the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	, the war with
Mexico	LOCATION	, and a later disso - lution of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		He condemned both the Texan War and the Mexican War as being caused by American greed for land .

		Stationed , in
1836	DATE	, on the Texan frontier , he came to the conclusion that the Texan War for indepen - dence was only a land-grabbing movement inspired from
Washington	LOCATION	.

		His Diary relates the story of the solitary individual who was making his way with long strides across
Ken	PERSON	- tucky , with long rifle on shoulder and bullets in his belt .

		Someone asked him , '' Where are 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, you going ? ''

		`` To
Texas	LOCATION	. ''

		`` What for ? '' ''

		To fight for my rights . ''

		In
Hitchcock	PERSON	's opinion , most '' rights '' on the Texan frontier were of this kind .

		In his note-books he recorded : '' I am puzzled what to do .

		I regard the whole of the proceedings in the
Southwest	LOCATION	as being wicked as far as the
United States	LOCATION	are concerned .

		Our people have provoked the war -LSB-
1836	DATE	-RSB- with
Mexico	LOCATION	, and are prosecuting it not for ' liberty ' but for land .

		And I feel averse to being an instrument for these purposes . ''

		Our people ought to be damned for their impudent arrogance and domineering presumption !

		It is enough to make atheists of us all to see such wickedness in the world , whether punished or unpunished . ''

		We have certain intelligence that
J. K. Polk	PERSON	is elected President over
Henry Clay	LOCATION	.

		... I look upon this as a step toward annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	first , and then , in due time , the separation of the Union . ''

		He criticized the government for the policy leading up to the Mexican War , for claiming the Rio Grande as the boundary , and for its treatment of Scott and
Taylor	PERSON	; but when the war actually began he took a prominent part in it , and became so interested that he quit read - ing and writing philosophy -- the first time and the last time that such a thing happened in his life .

		As an historical document , the Diary is of most value for the light it will give the future historians of the Mexican War .

		It is a genuine inside view .

		The comments and information about
Taylor	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and other generals , about the battles and the campaigns of the war , the conditions in
Mexico	LOCATION	and the politics in the army , will be worth much to the investigator in this unpromising field .

		It is here , too , that the Diary is fullest .

		For the Civil War period it is less valuable .

		There are some good things about the political methods of the War Depart - ment , and some sharp criticism of the confused military policies that were evolved at
Washing	LOCATION	- ton by civilians .

		Of Secretary
Stanton	PERSON	, Hitch - cock recorded this opinion : '' He has no general principles of action .

		He decides a point one way one day , and
a week later	DATE	, forgetting his decision and having no definite principles to go by , he decides the same point another way .

		He authorizes a particular proceeding , and , within a week perhaps , the circumstances being exactly the same , he flies into a passion with someone for having followed his first decision . ''

		Here and there throughout the book we gain glimpses of
Hitchcock	PERSON	's peculiar personality .

		He mentions `` my abomination -- a card-table '' ; when others were drinking , he retired to his room `` and thought about infinity '' ; at
Fort Jesup	LOCATION	, when the officers had the choice of attending a horse-race or going to a gander - pulling ,
Hitchcock	PERSON	`` took up the Meditations
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus	PERSON	, that heathen of Spinoza . ''

		He did not swear , he read much , he was quiet ; he liked music extravagantly , and played on the flute .

		It is easy to see that with the generally uncultured officers of the twenties and thirties he could not be a favorite .

		Under date of
February 16 , 1835	DATE	, he gives this glimpse of life at an army outpost . ''

		I am in a peculiar situation here .

		I do not wish to depreciate the merits of my brother officers , but it is certain that their habits if not their tastes are differ - ent from mine , and , while a majority of them congre - gate and either play cards or smoke or drink or all three together , I am left in solitude or compelled to choose between those resorts and the company of the few ladies there are at the Prairie .

		... I am certainly out of place here .

		My life is calculated to make me an object of envy and hate to most of those around men .

		In the first place , I do not join in any of the vices of the garrison -- not one .

		I neither drink , play cards , nor even indulge in the smallest license of lan - guage .

		Next , I am disposed to literature , and some - times indicate that I read or think ; and it is mostly in a field unexplored by others .

		I visit the ladies , and am almost the only officer who does visit the ladies ; and this is calculated to move to jealousy . ''

		But as the quality of the army officers improved ,
Hitchcock	PERSON	became more reconciled , and even found a few congenial spirits who preferred
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	to gambling and drinking .

		Like his grandfather ,
Hitchcock	PERSON	was an inde - pendent thinker about matters of religion .

		Soon after finishing his West Point course , he began his philosophical studies .

		He explained in his Diary that , having begun to doubt the stories of
Jonah	PERSON	and
Balaam	ORGANIZATION	's Ass , he endeavored to find out '' what a certain class of men called philo - sophers thought of God and man and life . ''

		Thenceforward philosophy was his religion , -- '' a faith freed , '' he said , '' from the gross super - stitions which give so many religions of the world a forbidding aspect . ''

		He kept standing orders for works on philosophy with booksellers in the
United States	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, and he read all that could be had on the subject .

		Wherever he went he carried his books , until he reached
California	LOCATION	, when he sold them to the
City of San Francisco	LOCATION	to form the beginning of the present
Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		A typical entry in his Diary says : '' My box of books has come -- near
$ 2 00	MONEY	worth , including Behman ,
Cudworth	LOCATION	,
Napier	PERSON	,
Niebuhr	PERSON	's
Rome	LOCATION	,
Scaliger	PERSON	,
Bentham	PERSON	,
Strauss	PERSON	, and the
Bhagavat Gita	PERSON	. ''

		In his old age he became interested in the works of the alchemists and in the hermetic philosophy which would find hidden meanings in mediaeval writings .

		During the Civil War he published several books on the hermetic philosophy .

		Of all the philosophers , he was most impressed by
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	,
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319 '' that God-intoxicated man . ''

		Hitchcock him - self was Spinoza-intoxicated .

		He had editions of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's Ethics in French , German , and Latin , in addition to five manuscript copies in English , three of which he had made himself .

		Yet he '' still felt a want , '' and made another translation .

		`` I find myself more in harmony with Spinoza , '' he wrote , '' than with any other man , dead or alive . ''

		And Philosophy was to him '' the first and foremost blessing in the world . ''


Walter L. Fleming	PERSON	.

		Chicago Before the Fire .

		* Chicagoans who have memories long enough to be worth mentioning relate most of their recollections to the year of the Great Fire .

		The year
1871	DATE	is our A. IT .

		C ; local history since that date has an orderly and documented development , while the happenings of earlier days have a legendary tinge and seem so im - mensely remote that we almost wonder if they ever could have been true .

		The city that we know is a palimpsest , and the older record has become so completely obliterated that its recon - struction , even in imperfect form , involves toil - some effort and difficult mental readjustment .

		Yet the span is a brief one , as history reckons ; and even The Dial , with its thirty-year period this day rounded out , covers it by more than three-fourths .

		Holding to the past by this and other bonds , we have to go back only a few years further to penetrate the mists of the years which antedate the Fire , and enter into the spirit of the city 's adolescent period .

		The retrospective venture is now prompted by Mr.
Frederick Francis Cook	PERSON	's '' Bygone Days in
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' a book of compelling interest to those of us who believe that we are citizens of no mean city , and who receive these greetings from the past , rich in their power to evoke long-slumbering memories , with feelings that are quite beyond adequate description .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	, now for many years a resident of another city , came to
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1862	DATE	, and was an old-time newspaper reporter in the service of our four leading dailies -- `` The Tribune , '' '' The Times , '' `` The Journal , '' and '' The Post . ''

		He was a well-equipped journalist , who was brought close to the heart of many important matters and interests , and has preserved an extraordinarily vivid memory of his experiences .

		* Bygoxe Days m
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Recollections of the '' Garden City of the Sixties . ''

		By
Frederick Francis Cook	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		He tells his story in a simple and straightfor - ward manner , and supplements it by something like a hundred reproductions of rare prints and photographs , mostly found in the collections of the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		His aim , stated in his own words , has been '' To shed what light may be his on the psychology of a staid yet surcharged period , now difficult for those who were not of it to realize ; rebuild for the mind 's eye a vanished city ; restore to its streets their varied life ; rehabilitate past types in their proper setting ; recall with a due regard for values some of the moving events of a memorable epoch ; and so provide a faithful tran - script for whomsoever may be interested in the *
Garden City	LOCATION	' of a classic past , or a somewhat unique social integral , or feel moved to re-people it in fancy with the offspring of his imagination . ''

		The spirit which has animated him in this en - deavor is thus finely expressed : ''
Chicago	LOCATION	is to the unthinking a synonyme for Ma - terialism .

		Yet , of a truth , she is a very Mother of Idealism .

		Unfortunately , she can not yet hold all she nurtures , nor always realize the visions she inspires .

		For the present , therefore , she must needs content her - self with the role of prolific matrix , whose issue on occasion answers the beckoning of older centres , in the hope of a fuller expression -- not , however , always realized . ''

		Both in the letter of historical fact , and in the spirit above set forth , Mr.
Cook	PERSON	has accom - plished his task with admirable success , and deserved the gratitude of the younger genera - tion for which he has chiefly written .

		It is in its constant forcing of comparisons between past and present that this book achieves its most striking effects .

		These comparisons are usually implied rather than expressed , but they are soon present in the consciousness as we read .

		What a suggestion there is in the very name '' Garden City '' !

		For there was a time when
Chicago	LOCATION	had more gardens than slums -- when Prairie Avenue really led straight to the prairies , and when
Cottage Grove	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now how fallen from its beautiful primitive estate ! -RRB-

		was in very truth an oak grove in which cottages nestled , cottages that sheltered simple house - holds that are hardly imaginable in the '' flats '' that are now crowded and piled in those erst - while liberal spaces .

		In those days ,
Kankakee Avenue	LOCATION	was the road to
Kankakee	LOCATION	, and not to the
South Park	LOCATION	;
Blue Island Avenue	LOCATION	was the road to
Blue Island	LOCATION	, and not to the Slavonic quarter of our modern hive ; and residents of the
North Side	ORGANIZATION	could start from their very doors to journey upon the
Green Bay Road	LOCATION	.

		In those days ,
Clark	PERSON	Street really recalled to those who used it the heroic deeds of
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	, and Wells Street the little garrison that marched from
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	to its tragic fate among 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the dunes along the lake shore , and
Clinton	PERSON	Street the creator of the
Erie Canal	ORGANIZATION	that had made early
Chicago	LOCATION	possible and was to make
Illinois	LOCATION	one of the stanchest of the common - wealths that defended the
Union	ORGANIZATION	in the great struggle against slavery .

		The descendants of the men who then walked those streets now think little of the names and their significance ; is it not something of a question whether the old thoughts have been replaced by new ones as worthy ? ''

		Probably no event in
Chicago	LOCATION	's history up to the time of the Fire was so much talked about all over the West , and so variously com - mented upon . ''

		The average older Chicagoan would have to guess many times before hitting upon the occurrence thus referred to ; and for the Chicagoan under sixty , guessing would be useless .

		The reference is to the cleaning out of the '' North Side Sands '' under the orders of '' Long John '' Went worth , then mayor of
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		The scene of the episode was an isolated sand bar - ren , on the bleak North Shore , with
Michigan	LOCATION	Street for its centre .

		It was the fashion in the rough-and-ready volunteer fire department days for the ' authorities ' to give the men that < ran wid de masheen ' and worked the brakes , on one pretext or another , a `` time , ' -- by making them instruments of ' moral regeneration . '

		... Here was an assemblage of rookeries , none above two stories in height , and very easily demolished .

		The brute in the average man was far greater in those days than now .

		There were no doubt many estimable citizens con - nected with some of the fire companies , for they were of many degrees , including one or two regarded as quite ' tony . '

		But others were mere • fighting ' organizations , with small reference to fires ; and sometimes one would get so demoralized as to call for disbandment .

		Thus it was men in many instances in no wise above the level of their victims , who in a riotous enthusiasm drove these bedraggled outcasts from their shelter , and forced them to seek refuge where none was obtainable .

		Yet this exhibition of barbarism in the name of high morality set • Long
John	PERSON	' apart in the estimation of ' good and pious people , ' as the defender of the home and an apostle of purity ; while to the • men about town ' it furnished a theme to dramatize . ''

		The result of this raid was to drive vice into
South Side	LOCATION	quarters , where it became a greater menace to decency than it had been before .

		But some lessons are never learned , and the zeal of our present-day '' reformers '' is misdirected in much the same way .

		A large section of this book is devoted to war-time memories , and deals with such inter - esting matters as the raising of troops , the history of Camp
Douglas	PERSON	, the closing of the '' Times '' office by order of General
Burnside	PERSON	, the partisan alignment of the foreign popula - tion , and the strife between copperheads and loyalists .

		The following passage illustrates the sectional sympathies of the city during the course of the conflict . ''

		With the exception of a considerable Southern-born admixture , the native population was in the main loyal to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	side , while the foreign-born population was divided into opposite camps , with an appreciable preponderance of numbers on the Irish side .

		Whereas the
North Division	ORGANIZATION	with its dominant German popula - tion , and the
Milwaukee Avenue	LOCATION	region with its
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian beginnings , were ever enthusiastic for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and the abolition of slavery , all that region which lies between
Archer	PERSON	and
Blue Island Avenues	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- excepting a German cluster about Twelfth and Halsted Streets -RRB- was never more than lukewarm , and on occasion dis - tinctly hostile to the prosecution of the war .

		Whenever there was a notable Union victory , the
North Side	ORGANIZATION	would burst spontaneously into a furor of enthusiasm , while matters down in the densely populated southwest region would be reduced to a mere simmer .

		But no sooner was there a Rebel victory than it was the turn of Bridge - port and its appanages to celebrate ; and these demon - strations generally took the form of himting down any poor colored brother who might have strayed inadvert - ently within those delectable precincts . '' ''

		Old Abe , '' the famous war eagle of the
Eighth Wisconsin	LOCATION	regiment , was on exhibition in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago at the first Sanitary Fair .

		The eagle '' made it plain that he had but a poor opinion of his surroundings -- that he missed the bugle call and the roar of battle .

		Then it happened one day that a noted war orator in attendance was called on for a speech .

		No sooner had he got well started than < Old Abe ' rose on his perch , flapped his wings , and evidently mistaking what he heard for the familiar , terror-inspiring ' Rebel yell ' , screeched a wild defiance .

		This is probably the only instance when an orator in very fact made the American eagle scream . ''

		The Copperheads come in for much comment , illustrative quotation , and personal portraiture .

		One of them is thus characterized : '' I am firmly persuaded that immovable Jacksonian Democrat -LRB- and a very Old Hickory , too , in appearance -RRB- , dear old Dr.
N. S. Davis	PERSON	, opposed the war on grounds of constitutional construction and none other : for , being a
York State	ORGANIZATION	man , he had no controlling Southern family affiliations .

		The good doctor lived long enough to be well remembered by a later generation , and few in
Chicago	LOCATION	have died in greater honor .

		But in his virile manhood he was a chronic storm centre ; and it was only because he was so much besides a Copperhead that his so frequently ill-timed ' constitutional ' f ulminations met with toleration . ''

		A few brief quotations will show to what lengths the
Copperhead	LOCATION	orator was willing to go in those days of high feeling . ''


Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	has deluged the country with blood , created a debt of
four thousand million dollars	MONEY	, and sacrificed two millions of human lives .

		At the
November	DATE	election we will damn him with eternal infamy . '' ''

		We want to try Lincoln as
Charles I.	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	was tried , and if fonnd guilty will carry out the law . '' ''

		If I am called upon to elect between the freedom
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 321 of the nigger and disunion and separation , I shall choose the latter .

		You might search hell over and find none worse than
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	. '' ''

		We have patiently waited for a change , but for four years have lived under a despotism , and the wonder is that men carry out the orders of the gorilla tyrant who has usurped the presidential chair . '' ''

		Still the monster usurper wants more victims for his slaughter pens .

		I blush that such a felon should occupy the highest gift of the people .

		Perjury and larceny are written all over him . ''

		These pleasant observations , made in a spirit of such delicate amenity , make the campaign of
1864	DATE	seem a lively affair .

		We may think we get excited in a modern presidential year , but we do not work ourselves up to that pitch of frenzy .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	quotes
Taine	PERSON	's saying , '' Let me once frame the true psychology of a Jacobin , and my book is written . ''

		His own effort is to frame the psychology of the
Copperhead	LOCATION	, and his conclusion is '' that among the Democratic masses of the north , antipathy to the negro out - weighed every other consideration . ''

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's portrait gallery of old Chicagoans is so crowded with canvasses that we pass from one to another of them in a state bordering upon bewilderment , so many are the memories evoked and so strong the temptation to linger for a closer inspection .

		What he says about the redoubtable
Wilbur F. Storey	PERSON	is unusually interesting , because he holds a brief for his old - time employer , whom he thinks to have been unjustly maligned in many ways . ''

		There was unquestionably a vein of vindictiveness in Mr.
Storey	PERSON	's make-up -- as there was in most strong characters in those days -- but it was never shown ex - cept against his equals .

		He was at bottom a just man , far from over-exacting in his demands for service ; while every failure had its day in court , and was judged on its merits .

		He was an incarnation of frankness himself , and demanded this quahty in his subordinates .

		Mr.
Storey	PERSON	's faults were hugely the defects of his qualities .

		He was through and through a newspaper man .

		Xews for him , however , included the shady side of lif e ; and in exploiting this he gave perhaps too much scope for individual license .

		I am certain that he never gave an order that a scandal should be salacious or made attractive to the prurient .

		... I permit myself to say that for more than a half-score of years most of the local • copy ' passed through my hands ... and that during all that time not one line of • imaginary ' or 1 fake ' matter of any sort or description was either published or so much as submitted for publication . ''

		Storey 's
Copperhead	LOCATION	proclivities were of course against him , and were probably the underlying cause of the animus that long directed the attack upon his private life and character .

		The chapter entitled '' An Early Sociable '' shall provide our last glimpse of Mr.
Cook	PERSON	's somewhat haphazard chronicle , and at the same time cast a pleasant light upon the chronicler .

		One evening , in the
summer of 1866	DATE	, he had just turned in his '' copy '' -- an account of the raiding of a vile resort -- and was about to de - part from the office , when the city editor asked him if he could `` spare the time to run down to Mayor Rice 's house . ''

		It seems that the eldest Miss Rice was giving a party , and
Storey	PERSON	had made up his mind to take what was then a new departure in
Chicago	LOCATION	journalism , and exploit social functions in the columns of the '' Times . ''

		The young reporter was aghast , for such an as - signment was an absolute novelty , and he could hardly take the request seriously .

		Asking what sort of story was desired , he was told : '' Oh , mention the decorations if there are any , de - scribe some of the most picturesque toilettes , but above all get a list of those present . ''

		At last convinced that it was not all a joke , the dis - mayed reporter started out , walked to the Rice residence , and rang the bell .

		Miss Rice herself came to the door , and asked his errand .

		He timorously expressed a wish to report the party , but the suggestion was received with constern - ation , and the young woman pleaded so elo - quently against this invasion of her privacy that he promptly capitulated , and turned away without any attempt to gather the desired in - formation .

		The only story he turned in that night was one about a mysterious baritone who chanced to pass the house , singing '' Marching Through
Georgia	LOCATION	, '' just as the reporter had taken his leave .

		His fear of the wrath to come was not realized , and he was never made to suf - fer for his lack of '' enterprise . ''

		But he tells us that a few months later he would not have escaped so easily , for
Storey	ORGANIZATION	's edict to have '' things of that sort written up for all they were worth '' had then gone into force , and the other papers were prompt to follow the lead of the '' Times . ''

		Thus '' society reporting '' came into existence as a function of journalism in
Chicago	LOCATION	.


Welliam Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		German dramatic ^ ^ ^ S
Witkowski	PERSON	's `` German literature in the Drama of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	mh century .

		-LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , as issued in Professor
L. E. Homing	PERSON	's translation , no fewer than 532 dramas by 227 dramatists are mentioned , a very large majority of which receive some discussion .

		Yet the book is neither sketchy nor unbalanced .

		Written for the ini - tiated layman , and aiming to throw light on the drama of to-day from an historical standpoint , Dr.TVitkowski has , with nothing short of brilliancy , characterized the main movements of the three chronological divisions of the century , and analyzed , from the 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, triple standpoint of art , the actor , and the public , the dramas that have given tone to the various epochs .

		After a brief but convincing resume of the dramatic situation at the close of the eighteenth century , in which he makes some striking assertions as to the influence of
Iffland	LOCATION	and
Kotzebue	LOCATION	then and even now , the author passes rapidly over the first section -LRB- 1800-1830 -RRB- with the dramatic failures of the romanticists , devoting a well-proportioned num - ber of pages to
Kleist	PERSON	-LRB- 7 -RRB- ,
Grillparzer	PERSON	-LRB- 9 -RRB- ,
Raimund	PERSON	-LRB- 2 -RRB- , and
Grabbe	PERSON	-LRB- 3 -RRB- .

		The portrayals of the faithful wife by
Kleist	PERSON	: the superiority of Fate , in
Grillpar	LOCATION	- zer , in that he did not allow it to relieve from moral responsibility ;
Raimund	PERSON	's genius in pleasing the jolly Viennese , and
Grabbe	PERSON	's picturing of battles , receive just emphasis .

		In the second division -LRB-
1830	DATE	-
1885	DATE	-RRB- he sets forth the polished but spiritless drama of
Young Germany	LOCATION	in its relation to Hugo ,
Dumas	PERSON	pere , and Scribe ; the idealizing drama of
Halm	PERSON	,
Gottschall	PERSON	,
Geibel	PERSON	, and
Jordan	PERSON	;
Hebbel	PERSON	, with his cornerstone of modern dramatic art in '' Maria Mag - dalena , '' on whose shoulders Ibsen stands ;
Ludwig	PERSON	with his excessive reflection and worship of Shake - speare ; the deplorable status of the German stage around
1870	DATE	; the years -LRB- 1874-1890 -RRB- of brilliant service to the German theatre rendered by the Meininger company ; the unsurpassed and unsur - passable greatness of
Wagner	PERSON	, and
Wildenbruch	PERSON	with his themes from Prussian history .

		This forms the best chapter of the book , because it treats of a period old enough to allow the final word as to its worth ; and it is this final word that Dr.
Witkowski	PERSON	has spoken with constant certainty and unbroken interest in his theme .

		The third section -LRB-
1885	DATE	-
1900	DATE	-RRB- begins with a terse analysis of Naturalism , at the head of which tendency stands Ibsen , '' whose influence no one who writes for the stage can escape , let him yield ever so reluctantly . ''

		For three years -LRB- 1889-1891 -RRB- the `` Free Theatre '' existed , and widened the scope of the theatre by extending the limits of permissibility .

		The movement as such died of inanition .

		Sudermann is treated as a writer of great talents , who often condescends to flatter the likings of the public regardless of the infallible laws of art .

		Of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's twenty plays , Dr. Wit - kowski thinks that scarcely a single one will hold a lasting place on the stage , while all will live as monuments of this confused and uncertain period .

		The playwrights of the present ,
Fulda	LOCATION	and all the rest , are treated only tentatively , and skeptically at that .

		The author seems to begrudge them their popularity , taking this latter as an evidence that they are living from dramatic art rather than for it .

		As to the future , Dr.
Witkowski	PERSON	is at once an opti - mist and a pessimist .

		He sees hope in the fact that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	, and
Grillparzer	PERSON	are more in demand than ever ; he despairs at the low grade of drama now being produced in the great cities , in the highest intellectual centres .

		The book contains a valuable table showing the number of performances of the most popular dramas from
1899	DATE	to
1905	DATE	, `` Tell '' leading the list with 412 in

		Anyone who has read a thrilling tale ittZSrl ° nl y ^ find in the last sentence that somebody 's pink pills will cure pale people , can realize the feelings of the reviewer who goes through Mr.
W. L. Stoddard	PERSON	's '' Life of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	Expurgated '' -LRB-
W. A. Butterfield	PERSON	-RRB- and discovers in the last paragraph that '' in the only document identifying
William Shakespeare	PERSON	from
Stratford	LOCATION	with the poet , the name of so illustrious a contemporary -LSB- Lord
Bacon	PERSON	-RSB- should be secretly imbedded . ''

		This book , which is a compilation of contemporary evidence relating to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, tries to show that when all inferential matter is '' expurgated '' there is no evidence before his death connecting the actor
William Shakespeare	PERSON	of Strat - ford with the dramatist
William Shakespeare	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The connection , so Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	con - tends , was not made till the publication of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	in
1623	DATE	.

		Here we have references to the '' Sweet Swan of Avon , '' mention of the
Stratford	LOCATION	monument , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's name heading the list of the principal actors in the plays .

		In other words , if it were not for these pieces of information in the First Folio we should not know specifically why the good folk of
Stratford	LOCATION	permitted a bust of their fellow-townsman to be set up in the church , except that they believed that , in the words beneath the bust , he was a great genius .

		The
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	showed wherein his genius lay ; and Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	holds that it is the first bit of evidence that has survived to identify the citizen of
Stratford	LOCATION	with the play - wright .

		And it is this part of the Folio that con - tains Mr.
W. S. Booth	PERSON	's acrostic signature of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	!

		There is , however , a reference which Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	quotes but does not satisfactorily get rid of ; it is a short poem by
John Davies	PERSON	addressed '' To our English Terence .

		Mr.
Will	PERSON	.

		Shake-speare '' -LRB- 1611 ? -RRB-

		.

		Here Shakespeare is the playwright ; but he also '' played some kingly parts in sport , '' and thereby fits in with tradition .

		Now it is admitted that the Stratford
William Shakespeare	PERSON	acted in the dramatist 's plays ; therefore there either must have been two
William Shakespeares	PERSON	acting in plays , or the dramatist and the actor are identical .

		Must we '' expurgate '' the conclusion that the two were one ?

		It is interesting to note that in Professor
Wallace	PERSON	's article in the
March	DATE	''
Harper	PERSON	's '' there is contem - porary reference to
William Shakespeare	PERSON	of Strat - ford , and to
George Wilkins	PERSON	the dramatist , in the Bellott-Mountjoy lawsuit .

		If what is generally admitted is accepted here -- that
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Wilkins	PERSON	collaborated in `` Pericles '' -- we have a similar identification ; for it is unlikely that
Wilkins	PERSON	would be associated so closely with two separate
William Shakespeares	PERSON	.

		Further , as Professor Wal - lace says , if
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was a '' mere pen-name of some one else , it would be difficult to explain how he and
Wilkins	PERSON	were both interested in the suit ... in behalf of young
Bellott	PERSON	, and how the same he and
Wilkins	PERSON	also wrote two plays together . ''

		It seems , therefore , that we may believe that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is Shakespeare still .

Thomas Jefferys	PERSON	with the statement that he was geographer to the King and published atlases '' which now are of little use '' ; and this is the almost universal atti - tude toward the u out-of-date '' atlas .

		Only very slowly is it coming to be recognized as an indispensa - ble historical source .

		A word should be said in appreciation of the monumental '' List of
Geogra	LOCATION	- phical Atlases in the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' compiled by Mr.
P. Lee Phillips	PERSON	, chief of the division of maps and charts .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	gives nearly 3500 titles , with descriptive notes where needed , and lists of the maps relating to
America	LOCATION	under each impor - tant one .

		Of early atlases the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	possesses all bat three of the forty editions of Ptolemy listed by
Eames	LOCATION	, twenty-two of the folio and fifteen of the smaller editions of Ortelius , eleven editions of
Merca	LOCATION	tor 's Atlas Major and eight of the Atlas Minor ; but the descriptions of these are less important than those of the miscellaneous atlases of more recent date , since they can be obtained else - where .

		The classification would have been more logical had the general atlases preceded the special ones ; parts of atlases would not then have come before the whole , and reproductions before the originals .

		The order of arrangement is , however , comparatively unimportant , since there is an exhaustive index of over forty thousand references .

		We think the exact dimensions of volumes should have been given , since the terms '' folio , '' `` quarto , '' and the like , as applied to atlases , are very indefinite .

		There are necessarily some lacunae .

		Curiously , the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	has no copy of the English edition of the '' American Gazeteer , '' although pos - sessing the Italian translation .

		The supplementary list , in which it is intended to describe current accessions , will in time fill gaps of this sort .

		Most people may think that this `` List '' appeals only to special students ; but any library can make a small collection of atlases , which will possess a constantly increasing value , by taking pains to acquire old edi - tions which their owners will otherwise relegate first to the attic and eventually to the ash-heap .

		Mr.
Richard Edgcumbe	PERSON	's '' Byron : * ES3E '' The *** Phase '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- '' '' book which , both as a eulogy and a polemic , challenges attention .

		Its author is well known as the Secretary of the
National Byron Memorial Committee	ORGANIZATION	and its historian , and as a biographer of
Edward Trelawney	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book rec - ords the impressions left in the mind of the writer after a close study of
Byron	LOCATION	, persisted in for almost forty years .

		It is divided into three parts -- the first part being a eulogy of the last phase of the poet 's career , 1821-1824 , and the second and third parts a defence of his memory against the most serious indictment ever laid against the Byron of earlier years .

		In Part I. we find the writer especially emphasizing two points : that the closing scenes of the poet 's life have not been adequately depicted by his biographers ; and that his disposition and conduct after leaving
Ravenna	LOCATION	in
1821	DATE	underwent a complete transformation .

		In Part II .

		he advances the new and astonishing claim that the underlying reason for the separation of Lord and Lady
Byron	PERSON	was a hitherto unsuspected relationship existing between the poet and
Mary Chaworth Musters	PERSON	-LRB- 1813-1816 -RRB- ; that Mrs.
Musters	PERSON	was the mother of the child Medora ; that she was the Thyrza of the u Thyrza poems '' and the Astarte of '' Manfred '' ; and that the endeavor to shield her and keep their intimacy unsuspected led to a self-restraint in the face of most degrading accusations and a self-immolation on the part of
Augusta Leigh	LOCATION	of which a human being seems hardly capable .

		In Part III .

		we find statements , made by Lord
Lovelace	PERSON	in `` Astarte , '' argued ; we find Au - gusta
Leigh	PERSON	defended and Lord
Lovelace	PERSON	attacked .

		The best parts of the book are those in which the writer is least controversial .

		We should welcome the emphasis laid on the good side of the poet 's char - acter , as shown during his career in
Greece	LOCATION	; and the record of his laborious days and nights spent in the service of an alien people , without , according to
Byron	PERSON	's own statement and others ' belief , desire for personal aggrandisement .

		He had faults , to the end ; but the most careful examination of
Byron	PERSON	's later days shows him a hero .

		We should regard evidence supporting a claim that
Byron	PERSON	's life from 1813-1816 has never till now been adequately understood , as of sufficient importance to demand publication .

		We must , however , feel that some assertions on important points are but too weakly supported ; and we must share the regret of the author that he is `` unable more precisely to indicate the source of information embodied in the concluding portions of the work . ''

		In his eulogy of Lord
Byron	PERSON	's later years , we can willingly follow Mr.
Edgcumbe	PERSON	; in his attempt to reconstruct our ideas of what happened earlier , we can follow him only part way .

		We can not , how - ever , if we are students of
Byron	LOCATION	, afford to leave the book unread .

		The gospel here preached is that of outrof - doors , of fresh air and sunlight , of abundant food and intelligent idleness , and of social responsibility for the care of the dependent sufferer from tuberculosis and for the vigorous prosecution of efforts to stamp out this plague from among men .

		Everyone interested in 324 THE DIAL -LSB-

		One may see from this list that the author follows the main travelled roads of our naval history .

		Now and then , however , he departs from them , and writes of such little-known events as the building of the Red River Dam and the fighting of
Ellet	ORGANIZATION	's steam rams at
Memphis	LOCATION	.

		The most original part of his book is that treating of the work of the

		Brief chapters are devoted to ancient and modern instances in countries other than the
United States	LOCATION	, but the bulk of the work deals with popular ratification in
Colonial America	LOCATION	and the share of the electorate in the making of our state constitutions .

		Eighteen pages suffice for the consideration of popular participation in legislation by means of initiative and referendum .

		The book belongs to the field of history rather than of law , and is a valuable study in the origins of our state constitutions , showing to what extent in actual prac - tice popular ratification is a source of our funda - mental institutions of government .

		The work is to be particularly commended as an introduction to a wealth of original material inaccessible in any other single volume .

		The work of preparing this biography was put into the hands of Mr.

		The writer 's sudden death interrupted the task , but it has been completed in harmony with his plan by Mr.
Oberholtzer	PERSON	, editor of the series .

		The work , one of love and loyalty to the distinguished ancestor of the author , shows no undue prejudice ; the writer has investigated carefully and tries to hold the balance evenly .

		Of course he believes in his grandfather , but he does not find him perfect .

		It is a good reference book for details .

		It consists of a chronological catalogue of arithmetics printed before
1601	DATE	, with a full descrip - tion of those in the library of Mr.
George Arthur Plimpton	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Plimpton	PERSON	's collection of such texts is the largest that has ever been brought together , including over three hundred printed volumes -- practically every sixteenth-century work of any im - portance -- besides a number of valuable manuscripts on arithmetic , of which a separate list follows that of the printed works .

		Author and artist have not felt con - strained to keep too close company ; each has exercised his own taste in the matter of selection , the result being , no doubt , better pictures and more spirited essays than a more constrained method would have produced .

		For example , the Thames figures largely in the pictures ; in the text , the Severn is more promi - nent as being more beautiful and far less familiar both to travellers and readers .

		Scenic description and his - toric lore , with some hints to anglers , compose the text .

		The pictures are confined strictly to the natural beauties of the English streams , which afford ample material for such exploitation .

		THE DIAL 325 THE DIAL 'S THIRTIETH AXNIVERSARY .

		With this issue The Dial commemorates the thirtieth anniversary of its founding .

		Thirty years of continuous publication are behind it , during which it has never missed an issue .

		It enters upon its fourth decade in the same hands and the same spirit in which its publication was begun ,
May 1 , 1880	DATE	.

		Few are the journals that have been con - ducted by the same man for so long a period ; fewer still are those which after thirty years remain in the hands of their founder and first editor , who has conducted it continuously throughout that period , making the history of the journal in a peculiar sense the history of an individual .

		The Dial has not been given to self-glorification or the exploitation of personality .

		If the letters that are printed herewith are somewhat intimate in tone and warm in appreciation , some explanation may perhaps be found in the facts above indicated .

		The letters derive an interest from the varied per - sonalities and viewpoints of their writers , and it is in them , rather than in any words of our own , that we prefer to commemorate the occasion that has called them forth .

		LETTERS TO THE EDITOR .

		As I am the only one , except the editor and founder of The Dial , left of those who contributed to its first number thirty years ago , I perhaps may be entitled to lead the chorus of congratulations on the completion of its third decade .

		I greet my '' fellow veteran , '' rejoic - ing that he is still at the helm of the craft he has guided so long and well , and glad that he is finding the rewards of faithful service highly planned and highly wrought .

		Few in these grasping , selfish , and avaricious days can contemplate three decades of such honorable , uplifting , and self-sacrificing effort , brought to such deserved success .

		I am glad to hear of your Anniversary celebration ; to which I can , however , contribute little , unless it be conveyed in the following reminiscence .

		I am prob - ablv one of the few men living who habitually read the original `` Dial '' on its quarterly appearance , and per - haps the only person who had the honor of having some verses of his own rejected in the last number of its early existence -LRB- in
April 1844	DATE	-RRB- by its editor ,
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	.

		The following was his delicious reply to my `` Sunset Thoughts , '' as they were modestly entitled : * ' Perhaps I may not print your verses in * The Dial . '

		They have truth and earnestness ; and a happier hour may add that external perfection which can neither be commanded nor described . ''

		To this he kindly added , as a P.S. : '' Perhaps after fur - ther reflection I may print these verses in ' The Dial . ' ''

		But this he wisely abstained from doing ; and more than one younger writer than myself may have been consoled in later years , when I have quoted to him this gentle but resistless verdict of our most revered leader .

The Dial	ORGANIZATION	that we know .

		We recognize that
The Diai	ORGANIZATION	has taken to itself the function of criticism of current literature , un - influenced by any other consideration .

		It has held this function from the first , and without change of purpose or policy .

		We know that whatever may be said in its pages is the honest judgment of a competent authority .

		We value the visits of

April 16	DATE	.

		To those who cherish the interests of literature and criticism in its shaping of the standards of living and the ideals of life , the survival of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	for thirty years is at once a consolation and a triumph .

		It may be accepted as a welcome sign that the still small voice is not wholly still , nor too insignificant to make an im - pression in spite of the din of a noisier journalism .

		It is through its acceptance conscientiously of the respon - sibilities of leadership that
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	has achieved a success which must be weighed rather than counted to express its numerical status .

		With no assumption of superiority and no tendency to hold itself aloof from popular interest , it combines the sympathy of a view from the inside with the objective independence of a critical and poised observer .

		It is natural that con - tributors are willing to bring to such a purpose an ap - preciative and disinterested cooperation .

		It is at once a privilege and a pleasure to be enrolled in such a group , and to extend to The Dial cordial good wishes for further decades of prosperity .

		Having been one of The Dial 's '' constant readers '' almost from the beginning , news of its approaching
Thirtieth Anniversary	ORGANIZATION	came to me with something of a shock ; for I had not appreciated that time had sped so fast .

		To a public institution like The Dial , however , age brings prestige rather than decay , so that it may indeed be congratulated upon having attained so ripe an experience .

		The Dial occupies a unique position ; it is not only the sole journal among us exclusively devoted to literary criticism , but it is unsurpassed and almost unrivalled in the quality , strength , and indepen - dence of its reviews .

		Librarians with literary constitu - encies find that nowhere else than in the pages of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	can they obtain such a body of serious and trust - 326 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Here is all manner of good wishes to you , and profound thanks for your thirty years of yeoman service in behalf of American scholarship .

Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	.


Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
April 15	DATE	.

		Do you , dear Editor of the The Dial , remember in the long ago when a little band of heretics assembled in the old
Unitarian Church	ORGANIZATION	of the Messiah to consider the possibilities of starting a new journal in the interest of '' Kingdom Come , '' and you were present , by invitation of
Robert Collyer	PERSON	, as a likely young fellow to take editorial charge of the same ?

		And how we balloted for names -- the only one which I remember being
Robert Collyer	PERSON	's suggestion that the paper be called `` The Head-Light '' and that the title-page be illuminated with a great locomotive in full steam and a flaming head-light throwing its rays over the title ?

		Fortunately for you , the scheme was too embryonic , the dream too chaotic and quixotic , to entangle you , and you were providentially saved for a more fitting job .

		I , for better or for worse , was entangled , and the dream was launched : it was shortly before you pushed your canoe from shore .

		You will pardon the presumption on my part , when I con - fess that '' Unity '' and The Dial have been intimately associated in my fancy as a sort of twin-venture .

		They were born out of the same impulse ; I believe they have been sustained by the same faiths in the receptive power of common , plain , every-day human nature , and that the wheels have been kept moving by the same con - fidence that the Universe is favorable to excellence , and , as
Emerson	PERSON	says , '' The dice of God are loaded '' in the interest of things beautiful and fair .

		You , steering the Dial craft , have '' made good . ''

		Your canoe has been replaced by a skiff , and now you are running at least a respectable yacht .

		Mine is still a crazy raft , and the most that can be said to my credit is that I have kept the thing afloat , and that I have not fallen overboard .

		But I rejoice in your success .

		Indeed , I have rejoiced in it continuously .

		I am sure no one can be prouder of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	's Thirtieth Anniversary than the editor of '' Unity , '' its luckless twin that has never known enough to know when it was beaten , and so lives on .


Jenkin Lloyd Jones	PERSON	.

		It is a pleasure to congratulate The Dial upon its thirtieth birthday , and a comfort to know that its vigor increases with age ; for certainly a protest against '' smart '' criticism was never more needed .

		I like The Dial because it takes its work seriously .

		I admit that I am most edified when , the subject permitting , its sincerity expresses itself in a not too sombre mood .

		But in a day when we learn flippancy before the ink of our first typewriter ribbon is cleansed from our fingers , it is more than a comfort -- it is a blessing -- that a journal of serious criticism should be entering so auspiciously upon a fourth decade .

S. Canby	PERSON	.


Yale University	ORGANIZATION	,

		I have studied The Dial all the days of its life , since it first came to my desk in
London	LOCATION	bringing welcome news of literary doings in
America	LOCATION	; and it is with almost a shock that I realize this was a generation ago !

		I think that The Dial commended itself to English readers from the beginning , perhaps because it had more of a world-outlook , was less ephemeral in tone and more dignified in character , than most American literary journals at that time .

		In saying this I do not of course forget my good old friend '' The Nation , '' for which I sometimes wrote in the Garrison days .

		In The Dial we have for years found sound helpful criticism , sane far-seeing views , and the best guidance to the product of the world of thought , -- not of its own day alone , for in The Dial we have had some of the best appraisements of the literary products of past times also .

		The literary judgments of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	have rarely erred ; they command the respect of the world of letters in two hemispheres ; and the fact that they have done so for one generation inspires the belief that The Dial will continue wisely to record , not alone the years as they pass , but the things we do in them , for generations to come .

		To have The Dial measuring the sunny hours during thirty years , is one of the wonders of the American lit - erary world .

		My long experience with nations that set value on longevity makes me take off my hat to The Dlal .

		I welcome the shadow-lines it casts according to time 's measurements , yet guided by eternal order and principle .

		May The Dial measure many more sunny hours , and aid me , as I strive with the editor -- may I not say the consecrated champion of literary justice and critical truth-seeking ?

		It was not a very exceptional thing to start a new periodical
thirty years ago	DATE	, but to have done so and to see it a living and influential element in the literary life of to-day is a bit of success not granted to many adven - turers in that field .

		And the success is all the more praiseworthy when it is remembered that the whole thirty years show no single moment of faltering in the maintenance of the high ideals which gave The Dial birth .

		Those of us who know something of the burden which you have personally carried in this work appre - ciate our indebtedness to your perseverance all the more deeply on that account .

		In offering The Dial , as I do , my hearty congratu - lations on the completion of its thirtieth year , I am re - minded of its steadiness and fidelity to high ideals and the best traditions of literature ; of its confidence in the integrity of human nature -- a confidence which asserts that a man will still write the truth though he must sign his name beneath ; and of the respect with which its verdicts are and have long been received throughout the world .

		May it prosper as it deserves !

		It must be a satisfaction of no mean quality -- as well as size -- to have kept a literary journal true to the highest ideals of criticism for thirty years .

		The Dial has been absolutely honest , fearless , and impartial .

		It has never had pets -- either among publishers or authors .

		There has never been a whisper regarding the absolute integrity of its criticisms .

		And , however severely I might be handled , of one thing I felt sure , -- at least that the critic had read every vital page of the book .

		That means a great deal to a writer .

		A journal of literary criticism which sets out calling itself by the name of that trustworthy old friend of m a nkin d , the dial , and which succeeds in living up to its name , is rightly the object of congratulation because of its consistency and of thanks for the service it ren - ders .

		In a country and at a time in which production of books is so facile and abundant , and in which the best -- for reasons of commerce , prejudice , favoritism , banality of taste , or ignorance -- too often runs danger of enjoying both less fame and less material support than the second-best or even the worst , it is necessary to the good health of both writer and reader to have at least one or two journals of dial-like solidity and per - manence , of dial-like steadfastness and indifference to the random fluctuations of temperature and breeze , of 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, dial-like security from the accidents that beset the dollar watch or from the noise that clamors from the steeple clock , of dial-like constancy to one great source of light -- in a word , of dial-like sense and sobriety and reliability .

		Those who feel the need of a reliable time - piece to help them know the literary time of day are grateful to The Dial for its unity and integrity of purpose , for its reviews written by men who read the books they review , for its resistance of the old tempta - tion to be smart rather than truthful , and for its edito - rial championship of the literary and critical ideal .

		They wish it long continuation of usefulness and pros - perity .

		The Dial 's
Thirtieth Anniversary	ORGANIZATION	ought to be matter for congratulation to all Americans .

		There is only one other periodical of ours which can be ranked with it for honesty and independence .

		Noble traditions and a prophetic vision have characterized every issue that has come to us here at the
Armour Institute	ORGANIZATION	, as for years before the beginning of our work among the young men it came to my study table .

		Let me congratulate you upon the happy completion of the thirtieth year of The Dial , a very notable achievement -- - more notable , I think , than Mr. God - kin 's , because '' The Nation '' by including politics made a wider appeal for popular support .

		Add to this a literary conscience , and you have the rare combination which has made The Dial what it is .

		It is pos - sibly not in order for a contributor to comment on the success of his journal , but he may perhaps be allowed to testify to the wisdom and daring of his editor .

		The timidity of the average American editor answers to the tyranny of American public opinion .

		We have nothing like the intellectual freedom which centuries of struggle have won for
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But the editor of The Dial has never been afraid to risk his circulation and adver - tising for the sake of the right , in the defense of unpopular causes , or to keep alive free discussion .

		Our methods of expres - sion have suffered a similar relaxation , with more of loss and less of gain .

		There has been a lax impressional and vulgar quality in our utterance , which has interfered with the weight and quality of truth .

		A sensuous and pictorial form has prevailed which has obstructed men - tal illumination .

John Bascom	PERSON	.

		My hearty congratulations on this anniversary of The Dial .

		While I can not claim an acquaintance of thirty years , for at least two-thirds of the period measured by The Dial 's existence I have regularly enjoyed its monthly and later its semi-monthly advent .

		Clear , clean-cut , handsome in its page and type , digni - fied and scholarly in tone , The Dial deserves the splen - did recognition it has received .

		Its leading articles , its literary essays , its critical reviews , have been models in their kind .

		Who ever read a pert or supercilious com - ment in The Dial ?

		Well do I remember a certain emphatic and indiscreet communication written with sophomoric fervor in Quixotic defense of much-maligned 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, '' poor little
Jane '' Austen	PERSON	, which was returned with a charming letter from the editor .

		He expressed full and hearty agreement with the writer 's sentiment and his vehement attack upon the traducer , -- nay , he even added the comforting statement , '' So and so is undoubt - edly an ass -- but let 's not say it in The Dial , . ''

		Thus his skilful touch upon the regulator has kept the inner works in accurate adjustment ; the pendulum has never lost its calm steadiness of swing ; the hands have duly registered the critical judgment of a generation ; and The Dial 's open face has ever recorded standard time .

		It is a great achievement ; and we of the
Middle West	LOCATION	are proud of The Dial , -- not that it is a product of the
Middle West	LOCATION	, or that it is the representative of the
Middle West	LOCATION	, but because in
Chicago	LOCATION	we have had for thirty years a publication representative of the world of letters , a journal which has so admirably filled its place in letters , and an editor whose literary ideals have had no small influence upon the taste and judgment of his time .

		I send my best wishes for the future pros - perity of The Dial , and my sincere regard .

		Among American periodicals there is no such other record as The Dial 's .

		Great journalism has pivoted always -- and always must -- upon a personality .

		The singleness , the consistency , the purpose and standards , `` without variableness or shadow of turning , '' which make Character , must derive from an undivided master .

		Else there is a wobble .

		We like people and papers that we know where to find .

		In the average Press , we do n't know .

		They are acephalous , but full of `` hands . ''

		They record the `` pressure '' like isobaric lines on a weather-map -- now up , now down , and always wavy .

		Greeley and
Bowles	PERSON	and
Dana	PERSON	, Garrison and
Curtis	PERSON	and Pixley -- six different kinds , but all Individuals -- were more implicitly trusted , I think , by more Americans of mind than to-day trust all the papers in the
United States	LOCATION	put together .

		Circulation is one thing ; '' infloo - ence '' is another ; but conviction by mental leadership -- that is the greatest thing that ever befalls a journal .

		All those other oracles of our Golden Age are gone .

		But here is the quiet Dial marking now its thirtieth birthday -- consecutive still under the same sensitive , serene , unswerving bridle-hand , and all and always in
Chicago	LOCATION	!

		It is not so much a `` record '' as a benediction .

		The Dial stands alone now in American letters -- a monument and an example .

		And this is because it has n't had to keep swapping minds .

		Many an able seaman has helped to trim its sails and stow its cargoes ; but at the wheel always the one steady hand .

		Power to The Dial !

		May its shadow never fall less true to the Hour and its need .

		Of course I am glad to add my tribute to the steady merit and courage of your Dial , if we may ascribe such human virtues to that friend of the Sun which counts no hours except the serene ones , but is no less faith - fid in cloudy weather , if we may credit the author of '' Hudibras , '' -- '' True as the dial to the sun , Although it be not shined upon .

		It is pleasant to see that your Dial has enjoyed more sunshine than the two American magazines that pre - ceded yours --
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's quarterly which you mention with deserved praise , andMoncure
Conway	PERSON	's
Cincinnati	LOCATION	monthly of that name , published by him for a single year , which you pass over in silence .

		It deserves to be recalled , however , partly for
Conway	ORGANIZATION	's spirit and enthusiasm in setting it up in that bear-garden which
Cincinnati	LOCATION	proved to be in his case , though it stood there but for a year ; and partly for his contributors , who were
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	,
Howells	LOCATION	,
Octavius Frothingham	PERSON	,
Conway	PERSON	, and -LRB- for verses only -RRB- myself , among others who are now less known .

		Short as its career was , it justified
Conway	PERSON	's pleasing figure in presenting its first number to the world , -- '' symbolized , '' he said , '' not so much by the sun-clock as by the floral dial of
Linnaeus	LOCATION	, which recorded the advancing day by the opening of some flowers and the closing of others : it would report the Day of God as recorded in the unfolding of higher life and thought , and the closing-up of old superstitions and evils .

		It would fain be a Dial measuring time by growth . ''

		Such has been the mission of your own Dial , to which so many good pens have contributed , and for which I have occasionally written an article .

		Had I been mature enough in

		-- To love and be beloved ; Men and gods have not outlearned it .

		And .

		how oft soe'er they 've turned it , Not to be improved . ''

May 1	DATE	, QUALITY vs. QUANTITY A MONG other sensible remarks , a ** writer in '' The American Printer '' had this to say recently : `` A short time ago I read the claims of a newspaper business manager who was talking big circulation .

		He claimed that a man out shooting ducks would stand a better chance of success by firing into a big flock than into a smaller flock .

		And so he would if they were all ducks .

		But if ninety per cent of the flock were mud-hens and gulls , and crows , and herons , he would do better if he let them pass and waited for the smaller flock .

		Circulation does n't mean much .

		It 's the canvas - backs in the flock that count , -- in other words , financial standing and probable interest of audience that the book publisher must consider .

		What 's the use in urging a dollar-and-a-half book on five hundred thousand readers if eighty per cent of that number did n't know there was that much money in the world , and would n't spend it for books if they had it to spare ? ''

		I N ADVERTISING in The Dial the * publisher wastes no ammunition , -- every bird in the flock is a canvas - back .

		The Dial is devoted exclusively to books -- its readers are exclusively buyers of ' books .

		Several thousand well-to-do people -- private readers , librarians , booksellers -- read The Dial regularly , and depend wholly upon its guidance in making book purchases .

		HPHESE people , the cream of the American book-buying public , can be reached only through The Dial .

May 16	DATE	, QUALITY vs. QUANTITY A MONG other sensible remarks , a writer in '' The American Printer '' had this to say recently : '' A short time ago I read the claims of a newspaper business manager who was talking big circulation .

		He claimed that a man out shooting ducks would stand a better chance of success by firing into a big flock than into a smaller flock .

		And so he would if they were all ducks .

		But if ninety per cent of the flock were mud-hens and gulls , and crows , and herons , he would do better if he let them pass and waited for the smaller flock .

		Circulation does n't mean much .

		It 's the canvas - backs in the flock that count , -- in other words , financial standing and probable interest of audience that the book publisher must consider .

		What 's the use in urging a dollar-and-a-half book on five hundred thousand readers if eighty per cent of that number did n't know there was that much money in the world , and would n't spend it for books if they had it to spare ? ''

		I N ADVERTISING in The Dial the publisher wastes no ammunition , -- every bird in the flock is a canvas - back .

		BRIEFER MENTION 362 NOTES 363 THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF `` THE DIAL '' : ADDITIONAL TRIBUTES 363 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 365 OBSERVATIO NS A BOUT OPERA .

		The operatic situation as it exists in this country is about to enter upon a new phase , in consequence of the retirement of Mr.
Oscar Hammerstein	PERSON	from the field and the consolida - tion of interests recently engineered by
Herr Andreas Dippel	PERSON	.

		The competition of the last four years between Mr.
Hammerstein	PERSON	's forces and those controlled by the Metropolitan Com - pany has had both good and bad consequences .

		On the credit side of the balance we have the spurring of effort which has revolutionized stage management , which has made it possible to pro- duce German , French , and Italian works , chorus and all , in the languages in which they were written , and which has enlarged the old routine repertoire by the introduction of many modern productions .

		But on the debit side there has been the frantic bidding of one company against the other for individual singers , and a general recklessness of extravagance which would long before this have spelled bankruptcy for ordinary purses .

		The rivalry between the two organiza - tions has been conducted upon '' sporting '' lines , and the public has benefitted in a very notice - able way .

		At the close of his last performance this year , Mr.
Hammerstein	PERSON	addressed the audi - ence in these words : `` This season has been a most unfortunate one financially .


New York	LOCATION	has been flooded with opera , and as a consequence the losses have been enormous .

		But 1 have at least the satisfaction of knowing that , large as my losses have been , those of the other house have been still larger .

		But I assure you that my efforts will not relax .

		I will be in the field as long as you aid me . ''

		Since these brave words were spoken , Mr.
Hammerstein	PERSON	has seen a great light and with - drawn from the cut-throat competition .

		The light radiated from an offer made him by the Metropolitan Company , placed by rumor at the figure of two millions , and probably sufficient , in any case , to recoup him for his losses .

		Thus he quits the game with full sporting honors , and with a salve to soothe the irritation of the inflamed pocket nerve .

		Hard following upon the retirement of this Prince Rupert of an impresario , comes the announcement of a friendly split in the Metro - politan management whereby
Herr Dippel	PERSON	be - comes the director of a new organization which 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, will give opera in
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-- a season of ten or twelve weeks in each city .

		This organization is to have its own conductors , singers , choruses , and orchestra , and will be the equal of the Metropolitan Company in all artistic respects .

		Moreover , it will maintain amicable relations with
New York	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- and with Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's
Boston	LOCATION	organization -RRB- , which will make possible an interchange of all the more important singers as occasion arises .

		Since both
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	already have magnificent opera - houses , the success of the new arrangement is much less problematical than would otherwise be the case .

		The new company is an
Illinois	LOCATION	corporation , and is financed in
Chicago	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, but the former city has the majority interest , and thus becomes the headquarters of the enterprise .

		The outcome of this new turn of the kaleido - scope is that opera on the grand scale will be given next year in only the four cities of
New York	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	; for it is a part of the understanding that neither of the companies shall make even short engage - ments in other cities .

		This is hard on the other cities , but in the present stage of the general operatic situation it is probably a wise decision .

		We have no idea that it will be the permanent solution of the problem ; nor should it be , in our opinion .

		But just now it is distinctly matter for congratulation that these four operatic foci should be henceforth assured for the American public .

		Another advantage is found in the elimination of that competition of which the great singers have been so quick to take advan - tage , and which has made operatic production of late years so needlessly expensive .

		It will always remain the most costly form of public entertainment ; but its cost may now be kept within some sort of reasonable bounds .

		All this smacks a little of the trust methods that the public looks upon as reprehensible , for the new organization is earmarked by the limitation of output and the suppression of competition which are popularly thought to be the wicked devices of greedy monopolists .

		But we should say , on the whole , that the artists were the monopolists here concerned , and that we were dealing with a benevolent trust actuated by pub - lic-spirited considerations .

		We do not imagine for a moment that the men who are assuming the risks -LRB- and the risks are certainly real ones -RRB- have any idea of making money , or that their plans are dictated by selfish motives .

		We should think it safe to say that the utmost for which they hope is to come out even at the end of the year , and that their paramount desire is to serve the interests of art and contribute to the devel - opment of the sense of beauty .

		The interest of the new enterprise is f ocussed in
Chicago	LOCATION	, because it is based upon the initia - tive of a group of Chicagoans , and because it will add a greatly-needed element to the aesthetic life of this city .

		Opera has hitherto had in
Chi	LOCATION	- cago only a sporadic and precarious existence .

		There has never been a permanent organization on a large scale , and we have had to be content with brief visits from
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	companies , usually made at the fag-end of the season , with depleted forces and under a conscienceless management .

		We have had to put up with all sorts of make - shifts , from the early days of
Strakosch	PERSON	and
Mapleson	PERSON	to the later days of
Grau	PERSON	and Conried .

		To get off as cheaply as possible , without making the inadequacy of the performances too glaring , has until very recently been the actuating prin - ciple of the management in its dealings with this city .

		We have been regaled with scrub orches - tras , hastily recruited from the ranks of local musicians , with ragged and decrepit choruses , singing cheerfully in Italian to the German or French of the principals , with a stage-manage - ment often so slovenly as to be beneath critical contempt , and with productions brutally mangled as to text , sometimes even mutilated to the extent of excising an entire act .

		And of this precious sort of entertainment we have had in some years two weeks , in some years a single week , and in some years none at all .

		Only this year and the last have we had productions well-oppointed in all the essential respects , and been given the privilege of witnessing performances that could hardly be matched elsewhere in the world .

		This leads us to the final topic of our observa - tions about opera -- to the sordid but unavoidable topic of dollars and cents .


Chicago	LOCATION	is fortunate in possessing the most commodious opera-house in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Its erection was a public - spirited enterprise , and one of its chief objects , as loudly proclaimed when the house was built nearly twenty years ago , was to make possible the production of opera at a schedule running up to three dollars for the best seats .

		This schedule would correspond , considering the respective capacities thus brought into compari - son , with the five-dollar maximum schedule of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	houses .

		The pledge thus tacitly given to the public was observed for more than ten years ; then the prices were raised until the five-dollar schedule came to prevail .

		By keep - ing
Chicago	LOCATION	on short commons of a week or two a year -LRB- with an occasional year of fasting -RRB- , the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 345 plan was made to work -- some of the time , at least .

		Last year a two weeks ' season on these terms was extraordinarily successful ; this year a four weeks ' season was attempted , and has resulted in a heavy deficit .

		On some evenings the house was filled ; on others -LRB- and more of them -RRB- it was less than half-filled .

		The moral of these facts , when applied to next year 's contemplated season of ten or twelve weeks , is plain enough .

		We have followed the history of opera in
Chicago	LOCATION	pretty closely for the past thirty-five years , and there is no con - clusion we feel safer in drawing than that which affirms the impossibility of making opera pay in this city upon a five-dollar schedule .

		We consider it as nearly certain as anything can be , that such a scale of prices will prove disastrous ; and yet we are given to understand that this scale is likely to be put into effect .

		That a scale materially lower will result in larger gross receipts , is to us a foregone conclusion ; and it is at least demonstrable that a scale with a three - dollar maximum would , if it kept the house filled , be ample to provide for the expenses of the projected organization .

		The sanguine expec - tations that now seem to prevail among the men responsible for our new departure in things operatic are seriously threatening the goose -LRB- which is the dear public -RRB- that alone can lay the golden eggs of their desire .

		CASUA L COM MENT .

		How
Mark Twain	PERSON	grappled with the riddle of the ages , the insoluble problem of necessity and free-will , may be seen by the curious in a little privately-printed book from the humorist 's pen , entitled `` What is Man ? ''

		The little volume was in the writer 's mind for about twenty years , he con - fesses , before it took material form in manuscript ; and then seven more years passed before it was printed , every sentence and every word of it being pondered deeply by the author in the mean time .

		But all this meditation has failed to produce any results of significance .

		That veritable
Sphinx	ORGANIZATION	's riddle which most thoughtful persons early see to be unanswerable , and early learn to cease puzzling over , as a snare and a menace to all sanity of mind and resoluteness of purpose , is thus tritely treated by our would-be philosopher after his twenty years of thought : '' It is a desolating doctrine ; it is not inspir - ing , enthusing , uplifting .

		It takes the glory out of man , it takes the pride out of him , it takes the heroism out of him , it denies him all personal credit , all applause ; it not only degrades him to a machine , but allows him no control over the machine ; makes a mere coffee mill of him , and neither permits him to supply the coffee nor turn the crank , his sole and piteously humble function being to grind coarse or fine , according to his make , outside impulses doing all the rest . ''

		From a strictly rationalistic stand - point , that is all true enough ; but , like many other true things , it lacks novelty .

		However , the book was written for its author rather than for the world or for critics .

		The book-rambles of an ex-Presldent , nar - rated by the rambler 's own pen , with critical com - ments and explanatory remarks , contribute not a little to the interest of his recent journalistic utterances .

		It seems that the original '' Pigskin Library , '' already referred to in these columns , became considerably enlarged by accessions as its owner felt their need in the intervals of his combats with wild beasts in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Fact and fiction , science and sentiment , history and philosophy , all have their place in this now famous Library , -- attesting Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's sincerity in his assertion that too much heavy reading is quite as bad as too much light reading .

		Among other passing observations is his declared opinion that
Dumas	PERSON	, in his novels dealing with the French Revolu - tion , is a decidedly better historian than
Carlyle	PERSON	in his famous chronicle . ''

		I have certainly profited as much , '' he asserts , `` by reading good and interesting novels and stories as by reading anything else , and from the contemporary ones I have often reached , as in no other way I could have reached , an under - standing of how real people feel in certain country districts , and in certain regions of great cities like
Chicago	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		His good sense is reflected in his declaration that there is no such thing as the hundred best books or a five-foot shelf of the best lit - erature , for there are thousands of best books vary - ing in value for different readers .

		Concerning such selections of representative works or parts of works , he doubts `` whether there is much good in this 1 tidbit ' style of literature . ''

		Yet some of the things that seem but tidbits to his Gargantuan appetite may afford no mean repast for others at the literary banquet-board .

		The increasing vogue of the roof-garden reading-room is apparent from a contemplation of the thriving and well-frequented aerial apartments of this sort now in use in
New York	LOCATION	and soon to be at the high-tide of their
summer	DATE	popularity .

		No fewer than five of the branches of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	are equipped with roof-garden reading-rooms , of which the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' has something of interest to record . ''

		The branch on Rivington Street , '' it says , `` first opened one of these outdoor reading-rooms in
1905	DATE	.

		In that first summer nearly
7500	DATE	readers gladly escaped from the unbearable heat of the reference room and did their reading on the roof .

		Since then new buildings have been planned with this feature .

		These out - door reading-rooms are planned for both afternoon and evening use .

		There will be awnings over the top to shield from sun and occasional showers ; tables 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, around which the readers can congregate , and a network of electric hulbs strung over the top so that there will be plenty of light for the industrious who wish to study .

		The Rivington Street roof , the model for these later and larger ones , has proved almost unbelievably popular .

		During the five and one-half months it was open
last summer	DATE	, from
May	DATE	to Octo - ber 12 , no less than 28,586 persons sat around the tables in the little square space .

		The largest assem - blage for a single month was in
July	DATE	, when
8246	DATE	people took their books up there .

		The
Hamilton Fish Park Library	ORGANIZATION	roof , which opened for the first time
last summer	DATE	, had a patronage of over 16,000 for its first season , with 6152 readers during the month of
September	DATE	alone . ''

		The excellent pioneer work in this field performed by Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	should not be forgotten .

		Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	's stoby of her vocation , which is appearing serially in '' The American Magazine '' under the title , `` Twenty Years at
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	, '' appeals irresistibly to lovers of the best in autobiography .

		Like Mr.
Booker	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	's and Mr.
Jacob Riis	PERSON	's own stories , it is the modest and straightforward account of worthy achievement in earnest and loving labor for one 's fellow-creatures .

		Her home life in a little
Illinois	LOCATION	town , her education and spiritual quickening at
Rockford College	ORGANIZATION	, which represented `` one of the earliest efforts for woman 's higher education in the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, reflecting much of the missionary spirit of pioneer Mt. Hol - yoke , '' her sturdy resistance there against the pres - sure of a narrow denominationalism , her subsequent choice of medicine as a profession and the poor as her patients , her enforced relinquishment of this plan because of illness , and her travel experiences in
Europe	LOCATION	, where a visit to
East London	LOCATION	and its scenes of poverty strengthened her purpose to devote her energies to the amelioration of the condition of the masses -- all this is related in full and absorbing detail .

		Incidentally she recalls a visit of
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	's to
Rockford College	ORGANIZATION	, whose pupils were eager to render some service to the father of her who wrote '' Little Women . ''

		But
Miss Addams	PERSON	was interested rather in the friend and associate of
Emerson	LOCATION	, and she remembers '' cleaning the clay of the unpaved street off his heavy cloth overshoes in a state of ecstatic energy . ''

		These recollections deserve , and probably will have , republication in book form .

		Some maxims of Pudd ` nhead
Wilson	PERSON	, that later creation of
Mark Twain	PERSON	's humorous fancy , deserve immortality .

		For droll association of incongruous ideas , and for shrewd insight into weak human nature , they are admirable .

		For example : '' The holy passion of friendship is of so sweet and steady and loyal and enduring a nature that it will last through a lifetime , if not asked to lend money . '' '' '

		Classic ' A book which people praise and do n't read . '' ''

		The man with a new idea is a crank until the idea succeeds . '' ''

		Truth is stranger than fiction , but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possi - bilities ; truth is n't . '' ''

		Few things are harder to put up with than the annoyance of a good example . '' ''

		It were not best that we should all think alike ; it is difference of opinion that makes horse-races . ''

		`` The English are mentioned in the
Bible	LOCATION	: ` Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth . ' ''

		``
April 1	DATE	.

		This is the day upon which we are re - minded of what we are on the other three hundred and sixty-four . '' ''

		Why is it that we rejoice at a birth and grieve at a funeral ?

		It is because we are not the person involved . '' ''

		A cauliflower is nothing but a cabbage with a college education . ''

		What additional gems of wit and wisdom the world is yet to enjoy in that sealed -LRB- though already partly pub - lished -RRB- Autobiography , we that are now living shall never know , if the author 's purpose of having the manuscript released only after a century has passed , is executed .

		Poetic genius and practical efficiency do not necessarily war against each other .

		Current reports from
Roumania	LOCATION	picture to us the poet-queen , who is known in the world of letters as
Carmen Sylva	PERSON	, as one of the ablest business women of her time .

		It is her judicious development and adver - tising of the talent and the resources of her country that , together with her own fame as a poet , have made little
Roumania	PERSON	one of the best-known and most prosperous of the smaller European kingdoms .

		Embroidery , the silk industry , and various manu - factures crushed out under the Turkish yoke , she has revived and made a source of wealth and pros - perity to her people , thus proving herself possessed of shrewd practical abilities commonly regarded as at the opposite pole from poetic inspiration and a devotion to the ideal .

		But , as Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	remarks in his late volume of reminiscences , in a passage touching on the life and character of his college mate , the eminently successful editor of '' Harper 's Magazine , '' a few years ' dreaming of dreams and absorption in ideals constitute not the worst of preparations for noble and effective work in the world of the prosaic here and now .

		Dr. Mar - tineau could descend with ease and grace from the preparation of a lecture on
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy to the repair of a broken shutter on his study window .

		There is something appropriate and satisfying in this inclusion of the less by the greater , this efficiency in small matters exhibited by men and women devoted to the large things of life .

		A RECORD-BREAKING BOOK-THIEF was not long ago arrested in
New York	LOCATION	in the act of offering stolen library books for sale , but by jumping his bail of two thousand dollars he has escaped the penalty imposed by law .

		The current annual report of the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	records losses , for the year
1909	DATE	, of
6131	DATE	volumes that have disappeared from the shelves , and
2356	DATE	volumes that were lost by borrowers and not paid for .

		Figures like these tend to destroy confidence in one 's fellow library - frequenters ; but there is a morsel of comfort , how -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 ever bitter its flavor , in the fact that not the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	public in general , but one professional thief in particular , and his accomplices , are responsible for a great part of these disappearances .

		An exami - nation of the books recovered proves that the mis - creant is an expert , and that his field of operation has been of considerable extent , embracing nearly all of
Greater New York	LOCATION	.

		The skilful obliteration of marks of ownership was one of his specialties , and he also took elaborate pains to secure one per - fect copy of a valuable book by destroying perhaps half a dozen in the process .

		That so accomplished a villain should still be at large is cause for anxiety and alarm to public librarians .

		• • • The library and the country parson have , in
New England	LOCATION	, been brought into relations exceed - ingly helpful to the parson through the liberal policy pursued by the
General Theological Library	ORGANIZATION	, which has its home in Mt. Vernon Street ,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		At the recent semi-centennial celebration of the founding of this library , addresses were made by Dr.
George A. Gordon	PERSON	, Rev.
Paul Revere Frothingham	PERSON	, and other clergymen of note , their remarks bearing on '' the vital importance to the preacher of familiarity with modern thought , and the significance of the service rendered by the library to
New England	LOCATION	clergy - men . ''

		The generosity of one of the directors of the
General Theological Library	ORGANIZATION	has made it possi - ble for distant users of the library to borrow and return books without expense to themselves for car - riage , the postage being paid out of a fund estab - lished for the purpose .

		No fewer than twelve hun - dred clergymen , in different parts of
New England	LOCATION	, are now enjoying this privilege .

		The library is well equipped , especially in recent important works of interest to its readers , and is undoubtedly doing excellent service in rendering backwoods theology a thing of the past in the erstwhile haunts of stiff - necked puritanism .

		• • • Trusts as material for fiction have by many American novelists and story-writers been skilfully and profitably used ; and now the French littirateur ,
M. Paul Adam	PERSON	, issues a ponderous work of the im - agination entitled Le Trust , on which he has been at work almost six years , or from the time of his visit to this country as Commissioner of the World 's Fair at
St. Louis	LOCATION	.

		The book is said to contain scores of characters , of many nationalities , and of all sorts and conditions , long-winded descriptions of scenery in all parts of the world , elaborate disquisitions on all the sciences and ` ologies , and solid pages of turgid rhetoric -- with here and there a passage of excellent and smoothly-flowing prose .

		Whatever its value as an essay on the iniquities of capitalists and the wily ways of corporate greed , as a novel it can hardly hope for a great popularity .

		Will any English or American publisher have the courage to bring it out in translation ?

		The scene of the story being laid in
New York	LOCATION	,
Cuba	LOCATION	, the
Alleghenies	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Dauphiny	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	, the book in some respects appeals to a cosmopolitan public .

		The ramification of a great public library is interestingly illustrated in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, where this branching process has now resulted in twenty-seven subsidiary libraries or '' branches , '' four '' stations , '' and two '' deposit stations , '' with a prospect in the near future of two additional Carnegie branches and five stations .

		To help the dwellers in this favored city to find their way to the nearest public storehouse of literature , permission has been obtained from the proper authorities to place in the stations of the ele - vated railroads placards showing the location of all these branch libraries .

		This is indeed bringing the books to the people , and should effect much in pro- moting the `` library habit '' ; but the true lover of the public library and its unimagined richness of accumulated treasures will always prefer to seek the fountain-head , the central library , rather than draw on the necessarily slender resources of branch or station , or even draw through the branch or station from the great central repository .

		Applications for the latest novel can , of course , just as well be made -LRB- usually without success -RRB- at the branch or the station .

		• • • The European demand for the books of
Colonel Roosevelt	ORGANIZATION	has naturally received an enormous stimulus from the distinguished author 's visit in person .

		Fashionable
London	LOCATION	, hoping to meet him at dinners and receptions , has been clamoring for his '' best book , '' and has been reading him up in that scrambling fashion known to all who have ever prepared themselves at the last moment to meet some literary lion from abroad .

		That sort of read - ing , so different from the leisurely enjoyment of '' a book of verses underneath a bough , '' is effective in its way , and at least diminishes the chances that one will compliment Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	on the fine character-study in ''
Fenwick	PERSON	's Career , '' or ask Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	when he is going to write some more `` Barrack-Room Ballads . ''

		And the practice has this advantage for the visiting lion , -- that it helps on the sale of his books , creating a kind of tidal wave that precedes his own advent to foreign shores .

		Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	as seen through French eyes is pictured in the '' Revue des Deux Mondes '' by
M. Firmin Roz	PERSON	, and thus enjoys a distinction accorded to many contemporary English and American writers by the generously appreciative directors of that excellent magazine .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is ranked as one might have expected , with such illus - trious English women novelists of the past as
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	and the
Bronte	PERSON	sisters .

		She gives us what is best worth depicting in English society to-day , says the French reviewer , who names '' Lady Rose 's Daughter '' as an instance of its author 's best work , thoroughly English in its tone and portraying in lifelike manner the aristocracy of
England	LOCATION	-- for which , by the way , and for the politics of
England	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	cherishes something like a passion , as many a somewhat wearisome page of her stories convincingly testifies .

Pioxeer Woman Educator	ORGANIZATION	.

		*
Mary Lyon	PERSON	was by no means the first Amer - ican woman to espouse the cause of advanced education for her sex -- Miss
Catherine Beecher	PERSON	at
Hartford	LOCATION	and
Miss Zilpah P. Grant	PERSON	at Ips - wich , as well as others , having gone before and prepared the way for her larger undertakings and achievements .

		From the two above-named women -- especially from Miss Grant , who be - came better known to many as Mrs.
Banister	PERSON	, and whom she assisted in the principalship of the
Ipswich	LOCATION	school -- the future founder of
Mt. Holyoke Female Seminary	ORGANIZATION	drew much of her early inspiration as a pioneer educator of young women .

		The story of that eminently successful pioneering is now for the first time told in as full detail as possible by Miss
Beth Bradford Gilchrist	PERSON	, a Mt.
Holyoke	LOCATION	graduate , who is evi - dently imbued with the
Mary Lyon	PERSON	enthusiasm for woman 's higher education , and is also filled with the sincerest admiration for
Mary Lyon	PERSON	herself .

		Miss
Gilchrist	PERSON	's '' Life of
Mary Lyon	PERSON	'' has for its documentary sources '' all known manuscripts bearing intimately or remotely on Miss
Lyon	LOCATION	's life , '' and its preparation was prompted by `` a request made several years ago by President
Woolley	PERSON	, voicing a demand that has been gathering force through more than thirty years . ''


Mary Lyon	PERSON	was born in the little hill-town of
Buckland	LOCATION	, in western
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, where the poor rock-ribbed farms are all tilted heaven - ward as if in perpetual admonition to their toil - worn owners to look on high for those richer satisfactions that are certainly not to be wrung from the thin and unfertile soil of the
New England	LOCATION	hillsides .


February 28 , 1797	DATE	, was the day of her birth , and she was the fifth of seven children , all girls but one .

		When the father of this rapidly increasing family died , the problem of support for the widow and her little ones became a serious one ; but Mrs.
Lyon	LOCATION	was a mother in all respects worthy of her famous daughter , and her energetic and resourceful administration of the little farm and the father - less home must have been a useful lesson in thrift and contrivance to
Mary	PERSON	.

		It was `` on the whole '' -LRB-
Mary Lyon	PERSON	's favorite phrase -RRB- the best of disci - plines for her who was to rear , with the slender means available in that region , a lasting monu - * The Life of

		ment to its love of learning and its high esteem for the things of the spirit .

		As the writer well says , -- '' Only in Old
New England	LOCATION	could it have mattered so little to be poor .

		There the world gave a chance at competence , instead of wealth .

		Money was not highly esteemed ; people had little of it , perhaps because they had for it few uses .

		America was young , and money is seldom reckoned among the chief assets of youth .

		Unsmothered by things , minds had plenty of room in which to work .

		Education was the badge of the only aristocracy recognized ; at the head of the intellectual hierarchy stood the minister , a college-bred man .

		The phrase carried a rare and high significance . ''

		The satisfying of
Mary Lyon	PERSON	's eager thirst for knowledge was necessarily accomplished with difficulty , and in fitful spurts of progress inter - rupted by wearisome halts and delays .

		Money had first to be earned for a term of attendance at some academy or seminary , and then , panting with desire at sight of the fair domains of learn - ing just coming in view on the horizon , the scholar was forced to pause and consider once more the prosaic question of ways and means .

		But whenever opportunity offered she grasped it with both hands .

		At
Sanderson Academy	ORGANIZATION	in
Ashfield	LOCATION	, a school and town since become asso - ciated with other famous names beside hers , she was assigned , one
Friday	DATE
night	TIME	, a lesson in
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's Latin Grammar .

		It was a new study to her , but between
Friday	DATE	and
Monday	DATE	she com - mitted to memory practically the whole book , and amazed both the teacher and the listening scholars as she recited page after page at the afternoon session while the sun went down behind the western hills and the school forgot the meaning of `` four o'clock . ''

		She afterward confessed that she had studied all
Sunday	DATE	, and it is not recorded that she was censured for it .

		Teaching alternated with learning in
Mary Lyon	PERSON	's educational development , and it will perhaps comfort some young and temporarily disheartened instructors to read that her first attempts were by no means great pedagogic triumphs .

		She is even discovered weeping bit - terly and vowing never to teach another day . ''

		Government , '' which meant so much in the country school of old time , and which is still so immensely significant , was the rock on which she nearly suffered shipwreck .

		Her spirits were too high , her love of fun too intense , to give her at first the calm dignity and quiet command of the thoroughly successful teacher .

		Indeed , her merriment of disposition seems to have been a lifelong source of trouble to her in the class - room , but a fault that her devoted pupils were more than glad to pardon in her .

		THE DIAL 349 in
Miss Grant	LOCATION	's school , first at
Derry	LOCATION	,
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, and then at
Ipswich	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, ripened her powers for the great undertaking of her life , the founding and organizing and management of the seminary at
South Hadley	LOCATION	which has since developed into
Mt. Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The raising of the funds necessary for even a modest beginning was a task to discourage a heart less stout than
Mary Lyon	PERSON	's .

		In a passage describ - ing the situation , we read : '' If she dreamed dreams , these hard-headed men and women , wringing meagre livings from rocky hill - sides , understood very well that nothing is more real than the stuff that dreams are made of .

		Their sons grew up to be editors , statesmen , preachers , presidents of colleges .

		They would give their daughters a chance , toft
Miss Lyon	LOCATION	made a business proposition , and they took her record as security , looking to her to get their money 's worth .

		One daughterless man , tilling a farm not over-fertile and with five sons to educate , gave her a hundred dollars .

		Two spinster sisters living in the slender comfort of their time signed each for the same sum ; soon afterwards they lost their property , but rather than be denied the pleasure of fulfilling their pledges they earned the money with their own hands .

		Of such gifts was
Mount Holyoke	LOCATION	built . ''

		On the rich she could not count with this cer - tainty for sympathy and aid in her great work .

		Of one wealthy family from whom she had con - fidently expected a handsome contribution , she finally had to confess : '' ' Yes , it is all true , just as I was told .

		They live in a costly house , it is full of costly things , they wear costly clothes ' -- then drawing nearer and almost clos - ing her eyes , she whispered with unforgettable empha - sis , ' But oh , they 're little bits of folks ! ' ''

		The charter for
Mt. Holyoke Female Semi	ORGANIZATION	- nary was granted in
1836	DATE	, and the factory-like building that first housed the school was opened and recitations began in the
autumn of 1837	DATE	.

		From that date to the
spring of 1849	DATE	, when she died .

		Miss
Lyon	LOCATION	was the life and soul of the institution her hands and brain had created .

		The story of her work there , of her methods , of the rare qualities of mind and heart for which her pupils admired and loved her in her life - time and remembered her long after her death , is all excellently told by
Miss Gilchrist	PERSON	, who has drawn to the full on the personal recollections of
Miss Lyon	LOCATION	's now diminished company of her former pupils and intimate friends .

		A word of hers , or a trait of character , may be transferred here from those rich pages ; but the book must be read as a whole to get any adequate concep - tion of
Mary Lyon	PERSON	's strong and original person - ality .

		M Sometimes I almost fear that we shall read our minds away , '' we find her saying in her early teaching days , '' with a perpetual suc - cession of books of mushroom growth . ''

		TVhat would have been her alarm in this respect had she survived to the present time !

		The follow - ing homely incident is rich in significance : '' Her speech was the more effective because she never used words when an action would do instead .

		Deeds in her hands served the same meaning purpose as stories in the mouth of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and like him she never broke their force by making the application .

		Entertaining anecdotes are told to show the masterly skill with which Miss
Lyon	LOCATION	wielded this kind of suggestion .

		One deals with incipient graft .

		A clever pie-circle conceived the satisfying idea of lessening the amount put into each pie an unnoticeable degree so as to provide an extra one for their own eating .

		Nobody , so far as they knew , was aware of the expedient , until one day each girl in the circle received an invitation to come to
Miss Lyon	LOCATION	's room .

		Presenting themselves in her parlor at the appointed hour , they found on the table a thick , luscious pumpkin pie , which their hostess cordially served to her enlight - ened and shame-faced guests . ''

		A sentence from her lips describing her school is worth quoting . ''

		This institution is a great intellectual and moral machine , '' she declared to her girls , '' and if you will jump in you may ride very fast . ''

		From the Bibliography appended to Miss
Gilchrist	PERSON	's book it appears , as might have been expected , that
Mary Lyon	PERSON	was not one to court publicity in print .

		She wrote hardly anything for publication .

		Books and articles about her , too , have not been many , which makes the pre - sent biography the more welcome .

		Its two por - traits of
Miss Lyon	LOCATION	and its views of the Seminary at different dates , with other appropriate illus - trations , are all of interest .

		It is a biography to place beside that of
Alice Freeman Palmer	PERSON	; the same intelligent zeal and loving sympathy have gone to the making of both .

May 16	DATE	, aid of which we have a fairly complete life of
Garibaldi	LOCATION	.

		In the opinion of Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	, the time is ripe for a profitable study of the period . ''

		Fif - teen years ago there was not enough printed matter and MS. available , and fifteen years hence there will be nothing left except these printed sources .

		But oral witness has its his - torical value , '' as both books prove very conclu - sively .

		Their tone , method , and viewpoint are of course widely different .


Madame Mario	PERSON	, born of English and American parentage in
1832	DATE	, but married in
1857	DATE	to
Mazzini	PERSON	's sup - porter
Alberto Mario	PERSON	, and herself devoted heart and soul to the cause of Italian Republicanism -- giving her life to it , in fact , as nurse , writer , lecturer , teacher , organizer -- is telling the terri - bly serious story of her own experiences , and , with all her generosity and breadth of sympathies , is telling it as a partisan .

		Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	, his - torian of another generation , writing without bias and with only a scholar 's interest , is more objective , more reliable , more enamored of lit - erary effect ; but there is something in a story of action and suffering , when told by one who has acted and suffered , that takes effect as no scholar 's compilation can do .

		Madame
Mario	PERSON	had made the acquaintance of
Garibaldi	LOCATION	on a visit to
Italy	LOCATION	in
1854	DATE	; she had at once become not merely his devoted admirer but his very intimate friend , and had somewhat later taken charge of his then invalid son , Ric - ciotti , had seen him almost completely cured in
England	LOCATION	, and sent him back to fight bravely for his native land in half a dozen wars .


Garibaldi	PERSON	's affection for his '' sisters in the faith '' seems to Anglo-Saxons a trifle exaggerated , and in one case at least an effusive letter to a '' sister '' was interpreted as a proposal of marriage , to the unbounded astonishment of the innocent author .

		As a matter of fact , there is no question that in such relations , as in all others ,
Garibaldi	PERSON	was one of the most scrupulously honorable of men .

		During a visit to
England	LOCATION	, some years after the death of his brave wife Anita , he won the heart of a lady of means and family ; but learning that her son was opposed to the union and that his motives might be misconstrued if he married her , he abruptly broke off relations with her , though in so doing he did violence to both inter - est and inclination .

		It is true that in this case the feelings of the lady herself might have had more weight with him than they seem to have carried ; but the gallant though blundering Ligurian was actuated only by generous motives , whatever the result of his actions may have been .

		It is in the pages of Trevelyan that we see this modern hero of romance at his best .

		Garibaldi 's exploits in
Sicily	LOCATION	rank with those of
Wallace	PERSON	in
Scotland	LOCATION	, of Tell in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc in
France	LOCATION	, -- with the difference that
Garibaldi	PERSON	's deeds are well-attested and are ours to study in detail .

		And with all his magnetic personality , his absolute fearlessness , his irresistible enthusiasm , his was the most lovable , the most generous , the most innocent , the most childish nature imagin - able .

		While living in the
Island of Caprera	LOCATION	, he learned one night that a new-born lamb had been lost among the rocks .

		A long search by lantern-light failed to find it .

		In the words of one of his friends , -- '' It was nine o'clock , and raining , and we were very - tired ; so we once more returned to the house , and went to bed .

		An hour afterward we heard the sound of footsteps in the next room , and the house-door opened .

		... About midnight we were roused by a voice ; it was the hero returning , joyfully carrying the lost lamb in his arms .

		He took the little creature to his bed , and lay down with it , giving it a bit of sponge dipped in milk to keep it quiet ... and he spent the whole night caressing and feeding the foolish creature . ''

		Contrast this incident with the act of the Mon - tefusco jailer who killed a nightingale because its songs were comforting the apostles of Italian liberty whom he held as prisoners , and the con - trast gives some idea of the difference between the generous enthusiasm that animated the patriots and the bitter hatred which that enthu - siasm aroused in the breasts of their Austrian and Neapolitan oppressors .

		The conquest of
Sicily	LOCATION	with a thousand men , when
Palermo	PERSON	alone held a garrison of twenty thousand , was the most remarkable military exploit of the century .

		It may be urged that the entire population of the island was aiding him ; but the support which the invaders received from the Sicilians , aside from moral support , seems to have been surprisingly small .

		There is a Sicilian proverb , '' Better a pig than a soldier '' ; and even when inspired by the encour - agement and example of those brave northern Italians who had come so far to risk their lives for a principle , the Sicilian 's military method was generally to await the issue from a respect - able distance and come in very enthusiastically at the death .

		The forced evacuation of
Palermo	ORGANIZATION	was a most beautiful game of '' bluff , '' for although the urban population aided
Garibaldi	PERSON	much more effectively than the countrymen had done , his ammunition ran short and he could scarcely have prolonged the conflict a day longer .

		But the '' bluff '' succeeded , the Sicilian cam - paign was the decisive struggle of the war , and

Garibaldi	PERSON	enjoyed a sort of popular worship that has been the lot of few moderns .

		Venosta wrote : '' When
Garibaldi	PERSON	passed through a village , you would not have said he was a general , but the head of a new religion followed by a crowd of fanatics .

		The women , no less enthusiastic than the men , brought their babies to -LRB- him -RRB- that he should bless and even baptize them . ''

		And the popular idol never deserved a fall .

		Blundering often and egregiously , a creature of wild impulse at times , woefully lacking in tact and foresight and thus often harming the cause it was his dearest wish to further , he remains to the end as pure in motives as a man could well be .

		Quite as much can be said for
Mazzini	PERSON	, the melancholy exile who tasted the infinite bitter - ness of laboring that others might reap the fruits of his labor , and who died an object of aversion to many who were enjoying the liberties his sad life had brought them .

		Patriotism was a religion with these men , to a degree that is inconceivable to our selfish and materialistic generation .

		There is food for the most search - ing thought in
Garibaldi	LOCATION	's refusal to live in
America	LOCATION	because there a man '' acquires a new home and forgets his country '' ; in the martyr - dom of
Mazzini	PERSON	, a man of affectionate home - loving nature , who lived his life alone and in exile rather than make the slightest concession to an unjust oppressor ; in the refusal of
Alberto Mario	PERSON	to take the oath of allegiance to
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	, and his acceptance of poverty and obscurity in preference to place and prefer - ment under a government which he disapproved .

		And
Mario	PERSON	's attitude suggests the difficulty which stood most stubbornly in the way of Italian liberty .

		There was what seemed for a long time a hopeless difference of opinion among Italians as to the form of government they wanted when they should be freed from
Austria	LOCATION	and the local despots .

		The monarchy under the
House of Piedmont	ORGANIZATION	prevailed through the clever - ness and enterprise of
Cavour	LOCATION	, and many Repub - licans , like
Garibaldi	PERSON	, suffered a change of views and supported it ; but others , like
Mazzini	PERSON	and
Mario	PERSON	, remained Republican to the end , and thus suffered with their contemporaries .

		But there is no need for them to suffer with pos - terity ; our admiration for
Cavour	PERSON	, who was patriotic and shrewd , need no longer lessen our sympathy for
Mazzini	PERSON	, whose patriotism burned so hotly that shrewdness could not live in the same breast with it .

		Anglo-Saxons feel a particular interest in the part that
England	LOCATION	played in the reconstruction of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	tells in detail of Glad - stone 's efforts to arouse the civilized world in protest against the treatment of political prison - ers by the
King of Naples	ORGANIZATION	, -- efforts which pro- duced their effect in spite of the retort of the Neapolitan historian De
Sivo	PERSON	, who reminded '' Lord Gladston '' that the English , who sold their wives with ropes round their necks for a few `` pences , '' had no call to complain of the '' little trials in
Naples	LOCATION	. ''

		Both of the volumes before us are full of the doings of the British Foreign Secretary , the brave Lord

		352 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, The Long Path of Light .

		* A fitting treatment of a subject so profound as '' The Problem of Human Life '' calls for wide and deep insight , both into the problem itself and into the manner in which the leading writers in philosophy have regarded it .

		If phi - losophy means anything of moment , it carries with it some solution of the problem of life ; and the connection of those who have taken a prominent position in philosophical discussions is to be found in the bearings of their theories on the solution of this problem .

		The book before us is a presentation of the view of '' great thinkers from
Plato	LOCATION	to the present time , '' and demands , therefore , a mastery of the theme itself , and of the way in which the deepest and most obscure thought of the world has been associated with it .

		The book is made up of three portions , treat - ing of Hellenism , Christianity , and the Philo - sophical Modern World , giving the great forms and eras of belief .

		It is not at all necessary that such a work should conform closely to our own conviction , if its insights are far-reaching and able to quicken the mind in its apprehensions of the bearings of human life .

		As the volume is much too comprehensive for even a brief treat - ment of the whole , we will confine ourselves to the second part , which treats of Christianity , its origin , and its earlier and later forms .

		The first topic embraces the character of Christianity and the view of life held by Jesus ; the second topic covers the Pre-Augustinian and
Augustine	PERSON	periods , and the Middle Ages ; the third period is that of the Reformation and of the later cen - turies .

		We are to bear in mind that the book is not a history of these periods , but a relatively brief and sharp discussion of their relation to each other and to the general problem of human life .

		This purpose affords illumination , and the plan is carried forward with a temper fitting the work .

		The unity of Christianity is not found in its origin , itself affected and narrowed by special conditions ; nor yet in an historical sequence which at every stage came under changing cir - cumstances and was modified or turned aside by them , but in a distinctive primary purpose which went everywhere with it as its inner power .

		It was a religion of salvation .

		It grew into and out of existing conditions , but always in refer - ence to their improvement and development .

The Problem of Human Life	ORGANIZATION	.

		By Professor
Rudolph Eucken	PERSON	, of the
University of Jena	ORGANIZATION	.

		Translated by
William S. Hough	PERSON	, of
Washington University	ORGANIZATION	, and
W. R. Boyce Gibson	PERSON	, of
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	.

		New York : Charles
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		This salvation was not of a physical , ontological sort , but ethical in its character .

		It was to be built up out of , and founded upon , the existing qualities of the world ; but it was to owe its form and power to a peculiar sense of the near - ness of the divine life to human life .

		The pre - sence of God in the world created new thought and affections , in whose activity all other activi - ties took on a new direction .

		The world was a place of difficulties and discouragement and fail - ures , but one in which the least attainment lay in the pathway of the highest success .

		Religion ceased to be an accident or incident of life , and became its verj r substance -- that without which existence sank into worthlessness .

		Instantly there sprang up a new feeling of the unity of men , sharing together the divine love and guid - ance .

		The individual could not be enriched except by a wealth which came to all .

		Hence arises not simply a return of good and evil in endless circuits , -- pleasure followed by pain and pain by pleasure , -- but a history of the world , a progress of events under the divine presence according to the divine plan .

		Gains and losses alike were brought into one forward movement .

		The mind and heart and active powers were all kept alert in the fulfilment of one great pur - pose , dear to God and man .

		This conception altered the relation of men to suffering .

		Suffering became a revelation , an emphasis placed upon events as they aided or thwarted the supreme end of growth .

		Suf - fering united men more closely to God and more sympathetically with each other .

		Yet suffering was not to be accepted as an ultimate good ; we were to escape it by rising above it , by going beyond it , by coming more fully under the good .

		Obedience and life were not plain simple things , but things of much complexity and confusion .

		Difficulties were to be encoun - tered in new forms , and by means of them we were to rise into wider and richer views of the divine purpose and the divine love .

		The mo - ment we stopped or accepted any good as ulti - mate , the vision of growth began to escape us , and we became as other men , with our portion in the present only .

		We lost our divine lead , and became subject to the endless tide of vicis - situdes .

		A mighty life-force had been planted in us , and only as we became aware of it and gave way before it did we become the children of God .

		Life was not made easier by
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , but rather more difficult .

		The solu - tion was to be wrought out ; the repose lay beyond the present , was itself so much of the nature of effort that we could never rest upon
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTAT , 353 it in simple indolence .

		All our achievements were living achievements , and led to others like them .

		Our triumphs were successes in doing and being according to the mind of God and the spiritual force of the world .

		Not indolence , but successful activity , a revelation constantly enlarging within itself , was the goal of Christian effort .

		How did Jesus present this vision ?

		He offers it as the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not simply an inner transformation , but an external one as well .

		It is an '' inseparable union of trust in God with love of men . ''

		It is a kingdom of spir - itual lif e ; a union of men in the goodness and mercy of God .

		Man is not left in anything at the sport of physical events .

		These are all gathered up in the watchfulness and protection of God .

		The human grows into the likeness of the divine , since it is viewed from the beginning as in the presence of the divine .

		Thus the child 's nature , subject to all guidance and in - struction , is the type of the Christian nature -- the fitting recipient of apprehension and explan - ation .

		But in this obedience there is no burden since it unfolds under the law of love -- love directed toward God and toward men .

		The ethics of Jesus rest on these divine and human relations , and unites them in the highest har - mony .

		It thrusts aside the hypocrisy of the Pharisee , which covers up under the law the entire brood of personal interests .

		The follower of Christ was to propose to himself the same perfection which he found in the fatherhood of God .

		Thus the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	-- a sim - ple , original idea -- was revolutionary in its effect on human life .

		It stands in growing collision with the world as found in human society , and feels increasingly the conflict .

		The ultimate and rapid triumph of the harmony and fulness of life over the partial and conflicting interests prevalent among men came to seem both assured and immediate .

		The spiritual power of a faith is measured by the conception of life which is expressed by its founder .

		The image and life of Jesus have remained , amid all aberrations , the constant centre and revelation of subsequent Christian thought .

		From this starting point , the simple spiritual personality of Christ , the author pro- ceeds to its speculative enlargement by the early church , and later to its intense and compre - hensive expression in the life and belief of
Augustine	LOCATION	.

		It is the purpose of this brief notice neither to follow this long path of light , nor to estimate its revelation .

		We wish simply to indicate the comprehensive and intelligent way in which it is pursued , the thoughtfulness with which it has been wrought out , and the reward which it is sure to bring to those who pursue it in a kin - dred temper .

		Jomf Bascom > The Career of ah Amebic ax Diplomat .

		* There has been some discussion as to whether or not our political system really admits of the '' diplomatic career , '' in the meaning given to that term by long practice over the water .

		In Mr.
Foster	PERSON	's record , one may fairly claim that the possibility has been demonstrated , and the great value of diplomacy on that plane , as com - pared with a service which is made the football of domestic politics , has been proved at the same time .

		This , too , in spite of the fact that he entered the service by the well-worn political route .

		As Chairman of the
Indiana	LOCATION	State Re - publican
Committee	ORGANIZATION	, in
1872	DATE	, he had led his party to a triumphant success in the
October	DATE	election , which of course had its effect in in - creasing the majority of Grant a month later .

		Senator
Oliver P. Morton	PERSON	, with his usual assur - ance in matters depending on his influence with
Grant	PERSON	, told the young Chairman to take the Federal '' Blue Book '' and pick out whatever office he might want .

		The Swiss Mission was modestly selected ; but for once Senator
Morton	PERSON	had tripped , for Grant had already assured the incumbent of that post of his retention .

		Instead of the '' something just as good , '' however , Mr.
Foster	PERSON	was overwhelmed by the immediate offer of the Mexican Mission .

		With no foreign lan - guage at his command , and no diplomatic expe - rience , he frankly informed the Senator that he doubted his own ability for such a position , and felt inclined to refuse the offer .


Morton	PERSON	was not impressed , however , and persuaded him to accept .

		With ordinary politicians , that would simply have meant a term of ineffective service , with a return to politics or business when the post was wanted for some other successful cam - paigner .

		But Mr.
Foster	PERSON	had in his makeup a feeling of moral obligation to do his duty , and the deficiencies which he had painfully felt in prospect were rapidly removed .

		The Mexicans were soon convinced that the new minister was an able , honest , and broad-minded man , from * Diplomatic Memoirs .

May 16	DATE	, whom they need fear no attempt at the double - dealing by which the profession of diplomacy is so often disgraced ; and this conviction was of great value during the period of strained rela - tions caused by the delay of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	in recognizing the validity of the revolution led to success by
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	in
1877	DATE	.

		In
1880	DATE	Mr.
Foster	PERSON	was transferred to
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, where he remained less than two years , as he had concluded that family inter - ests demanded his attention .

		This brief period included the assassination of
Alexander the Second	ORGANIZATION	, of which an interesting account is given in these memoirs ; also some of the famous state trials of the Nihilists -- among others , of
Sophie Perofsky	PERSON	, a woman of aristocratic connections and superior education , who had waved the sig - nal for the throwing of the bomb by which the Emperor was slain .

		It is told of her that she was accustomed to sleep with a hundred pounds of dynamite under her bed , in order to be able to balk the officers of their prey if she and her associates were detected .

		Sixteen years later , Mr.
Foster	PERSON	's services were again employed at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	by the
McKinley Administration	ORGANIZATION	-- this time on a special mission in connection with the Fur Seal negotiations .

		His determination to return to private life , formed in
1881	DATE	, was reversed
two years later	DATE	at the earnest solicitation of President
Arthur	PERSON	, who recognized his special fitness for the Spanish Mission , and for the inauguration of a policy of commercial reciprocity with the Spanish - American countries upon which the President had set his heart .

		He entered heartily upon the scheme for commercial reciprocity , but was forced to conclude in the end , after added experience under the
Harrison	PERSON	and
McKinley Administrations	ORGANIZATION	, that our system of government furnishes too many disturbing elements to admit of that permanence without which the recip - rocity system can be little else than a source of irritation in our negotiations with foreign countries .

		By special request of the President , Mr.
Foster	PERSON	remained at
Madrid	LOCATION	for a time , under the
Cleveland Administration	ORGANIZATION	, and might have remained longer but for his own desire to with - draw and take up once more the practice of law .

		But his well-known diplomatic abilities were destined to interfere with this plan , as before .

		A call to the cabinet of President
Harrison	PERSON	as
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, renewed attempts at recip - rocity treaties , the
Bering Sea Arbitration	LOCATION	, the
Alaskan Boundary Settlement	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Hague Peace Conference	ORGANIZATION	, all drew him at dif - ferent times into the service of his country , and in every case to his own credit and to the pub - lic good .

		Most interesting of all , however , are the pages which tell of the call received by Mr.
Foster	PERSON	from the Emperor of
China	LOCATION	, in the closing days of
1894	DATE	, to act as adviser to the Chinese commission which had just been appointed to the bitter task of going to
Japan	LOCATION	to sue for peace .

		It was a notable opportunity , and nobly used ; but space will not admit the details of the story here .

		We may only state that his thoroughly disinterested service to
China	LOCATION	, in the hour of her humiliation and peril , was indirectly one of the best services which it was ever his lot to render to his own land .

		In their important contributions to American history , these volumes are of the highest value .

		There is not one of the great subjects treated on which new light is not thrown ; and when we get to the position that young men may inten - tionally prepare themselves for diplomatic ser - vice with some chance of being actually called to it because of such preparation , Mr.
Foster	PERSON	's volumes will inevitably form an important ele - ment in their reading .

		If space were available , we would gladly quote some of his estimates of the men with whom his career brought him into contact .

		These are generally kindly , and never harsh in tone , -- though there are times when the lancet goes deep by suggestion , if not by direct thrust .

		For instance , when the desire of
Marcus A. Hanna	PERSON	to enter the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	made it politically requisite to take
John Sherman	PERSON	from that body and thrust him , in his old age and physical weakness , into the new and difficult duties of the office of
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, we are told that this was u an act from which the kindly nature of President
McKinley	PERSON	doubtless shrank , but which he did not feel at liberty to evade . ''

		Two points in his theory of diplomatic ethics are worthy of especial attention and emulation .

		At the outset of his career , in
Mexico	LOCATION	, Mr.
Foster	PERSON	found his diplomatic colleagues , almost without exception , making investments in Mexi - can mines or speculating in mining stocks .

		For himself , he set the rule at once that as a diplo - matic representative he should have no interests of any kind whatever in the country to which he was accredited , and no personal complications in the claims of any of his fellow countrymen .

		If all our representatives , especially to the coun - tries of this hemisphere , had been equally con - scientious in observing the demands of personal and national propriety in this matter , our repu - tation would have been spared a good many
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 355 stains which it now has to carry .

		The other point relates to the attitude of the diplomat to home politics .

		During his mission to
Mexico	LOCATION	, Mr.
Foster	PERSON	was persuaded by
Senator Morton	PERSON	to return temporarily to the
United States	LOCATION	and take part in the electoral contest of
1876	DATE	.

		`` I regard that act , '' he says , '' as one of the most serious mistakes of my diplomatic career .

		A diplomatic officer , more than any other , should be a non-partisan representative . ''

		He also re - lates in another chapter an experience of Secre - ary Hay .

		who was persuaded -LRB- if that is the word to use -RRB- by President
Roosevelt	PERSON	to make a speech in
New York City	LOCATION	on the eve of the campaign of
1904	DATE	.

		He remonstrated with the President , insisting that the Secretary of State should not take part in politics , since it would have a bad influence on the
Diplomatic Corps	ORGANIZATION	, and injure his influence with the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, which must pass on his treaties and policies .

		To all this , the reply of President
Roosevelt	PERSON	was that if Secretary Hay did not make the speech the election might be lost , and he not be Secretary of State the next term .

		We close with a few lines from Mr.
Foster	PERSON	's own closing paragraph : '' When , at the close of ray mission to
Spain	LOCATION	, I re - sumed my residence in
Washington	LOCATION	, I was fifty years of age ; and from that date forward I did my most laborious and successful work .

		It seemed as if the earlier portion of my life had been merely a preparation for the labor which was in store for me , and which proved the most useful and important .

		I have been highly honored by my country with many important public trusts , but I have the consciousness of having earnestly striven to discharge them faithfully . ''

		ages . ''

		This literature , she says , '' appears as a spectacle , a progress , a pageant , wherein every figure is not only a marvel but the embodiment of a whole invisible plexus of secret influences , ideas , traditions , and revolts .

		1 ' Gladly does the reader take a position with the author on her balcony , which she calls '' the watch-tower of a tranquil mind , '' to look on this pageant -- `` the continuous genius of a people . ''

		A glance at the table of contents , which serves as a telescope to sweep the whole proces - sion into our ken , shows the great divisions of the progress -- `` In the Distance , '' `` The Roman - tics , '' '' The Sons of Science . ''

		The first division permits a promiscuous grouping .

		Here are poet , king , scientist , mystic , rebel , in due range .

		How shall we come close to the spirit of the French nation , if those we look upon differ so markedly in temperament as
Fenelon	LOCATION	and Voltaire ?

		We listen to the overture to the march in the essay on French Poetry , eager for a clue to the line of thought we are to busy ourselves with as this varied company troops past us .

		But this over - ture , though strong and fine , is found to have little relation to what follows .

		In the entire com - pany there are but five poets -- Ronsard ,
Racine	LOCATION	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Alfred De Musset	PERSON	, and
Beaude	PERSON	- laire , -- and these are so distantly scattered in the procession as to lack impressiveness .

		We must be satisfied , then , with this essay as a com - ment on French Poetry ; for of these five poets only
Racine	LOCATION	is closely described .

		Some may think he is given more than his due ; others may feel that
Villon	PERSON	is more representative of the early modern French spirit than
Ronsard	PERSON	, and that
Paul Verlaine	PERSON	is more typical of later French poetry than
Beaudelaire	LOCATION	.

		Accepting them , however , as chosen ,
Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	, in interpreting these poets as part of the '' continuous genius of the French , '' shows herself to be more of a biographer than critic .

		Victor Hugo will not be made clearer to an English reader by the mass of personal detail which in nowise explains his poetry .

		Alfred De Musset is enmeshed in his amorous intrigues , till the fair soul of the hapless youth seems lost in a maze of gossip .

		Beaudelaire is not keenly defined as a decadent ; and being here in the rank of the poets , he gains no laurels for his beautiful prose .

		In spite of
Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	's avowal of allegiance to French poetry , there is reason to doubt its warmth .

		True ,
France	LOCATION	has no such poets as
England	LOCATION	; but the French themselves feel no lack in their poetry .

		From infancy they lisp it in the fables of
Fontaine	LOCATION	; in early youth they are well grounded in the sen - 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, timent of Lamartine and in the wit of Moliere .

		As for
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, he is by acclamation the very '' genius '' of French poetry .

		But it is just this subtle genius we do not get from mere bio - graphical data .

		It is well , after looking at these poets , who are far apart in other ways than in this procession , to read again
Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	's introductory essay on French Poetry , and thus be assured that her feeling for the subject is sincere and even noble .

		Not only is the treatment of the poets of the pageant unsatisfactory , that of the great prose writers of
France	LOCATION	is even more so ; for it is through French prose that English readers may best discern the French spirit .

		Hence one re - sents a broad inclusion of minor influences in French thought , when these might better give way to the originative forces that have given French literature , in so many aspects , an unquestionable superiority .

		Voltaire ,
Balzac	LOCATION	, Sainte-Beuve , and
Anatole France	LOCATION	fill large places in French literature ; but do they vitally cohere without Rabelais and Montaigne ?

		Here was an excellent opportunity to define the '' continuous genius '' of the French people -- a genius for satire , for urbane discursiveness , for social insight , for subduing the whole realm of thought and -LRB- as with Balzac -RRB- of passion , to rhythmic order , to stable congruity ; above all , a genius for what might be called literary conse - cration .

		Any of this group is typical of this one phase of French literary biography -- none more so than
Voltaire	LOCATION	; yet
Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	allows Professor Lanson to say the only vital thing about
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, a man in whom meet so many tendencies of the French mind -- keen - ness , criticism , a zeal for human progress even when deriding the steps thereto , a passionate interest in the things of the mind independent of race or religion , a catholic intellectuality .


Goldsmith	PERSON	's description of him defending En - glish literature in a hostile company symbolizes
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's attitude toward all literature .

		His impatience of
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	, for wishing to be thought an English gentleman rather than a writer of witty comedies , suggests the difference between the literary spirit of
France	LOCATION	and of
England	LOCATION	.

		The French subordinate life to liter - ature ; the English use literature for some gain in life .

		Balzac , whose conquest of literature is
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leonic , whose
Comedie Humaine	ORGANIZATION	expresses in its very title the French genius for social inter - pretation , has made but little impression upon
Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this , as in so much of her book , she is busied with what is adventitious in a man 's life , and not with what is essential in his art .

		She admits that Balzac created the modern novel , and then denies any meaning in this honor by ranking him with Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		The man who saw society and saw it whole , who caught the secret of passion as it affects life , and of money as a passion , and of vocational success as it is thwarted by or rises superior to either sex or money , has no affinity with
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		Fortunately ,
Madame Du Claux	ORGANIZATION	saves herself from total error in her estimate of Balzac by a real appreciation of some of his qualities ; but his splendid achieve - ment -- so all-inclusive , so integrated , so start - ling in insight , that his name comes to mean life -- needs a connotation other than this .

		So too does Balzac 's critic enemy , Sainte-Beuve , who did for French literature what the novelist did for French life -- grasped .

		it entire and gave it new meaning , teaching any critic who comes after him that he must know not only literature but history and philosophy in their relation to the individual writer .

		Madame Du Claux is not a vital literary critic , and there - fore does not do justice to the greatest of critics .

		She does , however , approach something like real critical acumen in her study of
Anatole France	LOCATION	, whom she discriminatingly contrasts with
Maurice Barr & s	ORGANIZATION	in a few large generaliza - tions which are worth more as criticism than whole pages of intimate gossip .


Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	's interest in French his - tory is keen ; her ability to trace the under - currents , to point out the depths and shallows of its wayward course , is sure .

		It is only fair to give all possible credit to the part of the pageant in which men of historical significance appear .

		The placing of
Louis Quatorze	LOCATION	in relation to the spirit of his time is excellent .


Rousseau	PERSON	has perhaps never been so thoroughly presented within the small compass of an essay .

		One may question the right of LaClos and Liancourt to be in this

		The interpretation of '' The Sons of Science '' is also illuminating .

		Whether they are real scientists like Fontenelle , or those who , like
Ernest Renan	PERSON	and
Hippolyte Taine	PERSON	, applied a scientific method to the study of religion and literature , their part in the procession is made brilliant and convinc - ing .

		In fact , there is a tendency throughout these discussions to make philosophy and science , as developed by the French , their real genius ; whereas the genius of the French is distinctively literary , and everything else is subordinate to this .

John Locke	PERSON	anticipated
Rousseau	PERSON	's educational doctrine , just as
Richardson	PERSON	had anticipated much of the sentimentality of '' La Xouvelle Heloi ` se '' ; but
Rousseau	PERSON	alone possessed the magic of the winged word to blow his truth about the world .

		He had the power of the angel voice to trumpet his message till it toppled the throne of kings .

		German theologians pointed out the necessity of Hebrew philology in the history of religion before
Ernest Renan	PERSON	.

		They lacked
Renan	ORGANIZATION	's sweet reasonableness in proving this ; hence Renan is read and the Germans are for - gotten .

		Even
Fenelon	PERSON	's lessons to the
Due de Bourgogne	ORGANIZATION	are cast in artistic form .

		French - men , whether scientists , scholars , reformers , or critics , are writers above all else , and form is the priceless wedding-garment which singles them out at the feast of things intellectual .

		The quality of this form is what we should most wish to see when all these types are massed as a
Pageant of Great Writers	ORGANIZATION	.

		But our guide , intellectually alert as she is , forgot this in attending to much which , though creditable to her learning , -LSB- is not closely according to her initial programme .

		Xo degree of attention to philosophy and sci - ence as an expression of the French spirit can keep one from looking , as this pageant passes , for a persistent element in French history and letters -- a line of notable women .

		By the promise made of a literary review in the preface ,
Madame de Maintenon	ORGANIZATION	has a more legitimate right among the choice and master spirits of her age than
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		She had a finer influ - ence upon
Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	's favorite ,
Racine	LOCATION	.


Madame de Sevigne	ORGANIZATION	had a quality of the French spirit beautiful to know .

		By a perverse selec - tion , we have a paper on '' Goethe in
France	LOCATION	, '' though the very logic of the subject demands that we see how
France	LOCATION	went well equipped to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	when
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	was gathering ma - terial for her De V Allemagne .

		The only woman observable from the tower is George Sand , and she is so trivially exhibited that her place might well have been given to
Flaubert	LOCATION	, who loved to call her master .

		The enthusiastic Sandist , will resent
Madame DuClaux	ORGANIZATION	's airing of unpleasant facts which in no way affect the fine imagina - tion of that unique force in literature .

		There are two essays on George Sand , and scarcely a word about her literary fecundity , her fine idyllic sense , her aptitude for an intellectual comrade - ship so helpful to Balzac in his precarious career , to Sainte-Beuve 's simple life of reading and writing , and to Flaubert in his sullen isolation .

		The varied gifts of George Sand should not be ignored , even by an Englishwoman .

		Both
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	were glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to her .

		Lit - erature itself has been enriched by her love of the picturesque , her large feeling for things human , her ease and grace in writing .

		She belongs truly to the French genius .

		And what is this genius ?

		Is it not a match - less sincerity toward art , and toward literature as the greatest art ?

		This sincerity is their inspiration to an almost superhuman industry in acquiring a style adequate to every form of expression .

		Style -- that is the gift of the French .

		It is not in their literature alone , but in their whole range of life , -- in their delicate food , their ornate clothing , their fine speech , their distinguished manners , their superb capi - tal which in itself is a glory of art .

		The Xegbo Problem Viewed across the Color-line .

		* The American Race-problem is one which still interests writers and readers , if one may judge from the annual output of books and pamphlets about it .

		Once in a long while a book is written which is worth reading ; many are useless , or worse .

		Professor
Kelly Miller	PERSON	's '' Race Adjustment '' is well worth reading .

		The author is a negro , born in
North Carolina	LOCATION	during the Civil War ; it is probable that he was a slave for two years , although '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' does not enlighten us on that point ; for the past twenty years he has been a professor in
Howard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has wit - nessed the trial of various plans for the solution of the race-problem , and has seen most of them fail ; he knows much of the conditions of negro life , and is acquainted with the plans and opin - ions of the leaders of the race .

		His book con - tains nineteen chapters ; the most important topics treated are Radicals and Conservatives , The
Leopard	ORGANIZATION	's Spots , Social Equality ,
The City Xegro	LOCATION	, Religion as a Solvent of the Race Prob - lem ,
Surplus Negro Women	ORGANIZATION	, Rise of the Pro- fessional Class ,
Frederick Douglass	PERSON	,

		358 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, to the radical wing of the negro progressives .

		With two exceptions -- these being fierce and excusable criticisms of Mr.
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	and Mr.
John Temple	PERSON	Graves -- the papers making up the volume are moderate in feeling and state - ment ; they show evidence of plain common - sense , and there is an absence of that peculiar irritating quality that is usually found in race - problem literature .

		The style is clear and force - ful , vivid at times ; but never is the language violent .

		The author is fond of comparisons , and makes some effective ones .

		The following striking sentences are selected as typical : '' Verbal vehemence void of practical power to enforce demands is an ineffectual missile to be hurled against the stronghold of prejudice . '' ''

		All truly useful men must be , in a measure , time - servers ; for unless they serve their time they can scarcely serve at all . '' ''


Douglass	PERSON	insisted upon rights ;
Washington	LOCATION	insists upon duty . ''

		That he possesses a sense of humor , the writer frequently shows ; as when , in quoting
Freeman	PERSON	's suggestion for a solution of the Celtic and Afri - can race-problems , he remarks : '' Let each Irish - man kill a negro , and get hanged for it . ''

		The best of the book is the first chapter -- an interesting comparision of the policies and the leaders of the negro radicals and conservatives .

		Booker
Washington	LOCATION	is classed as a conservative ; Professor
DuBois	PERSON	, and
Trotter	PERSON	, editor of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Guardian , '' are leading radicals .

		The author is conservative , but will not yield unre - served allegiance to
Washington	LOCATION	.

		One interested in learning what the negroes think about the negro problem will profit by this discussion of the conflicting policies and the keen analysis of the motives and principles of the rival groups of leaders .


Washington	LOCATION	, the conservative , who came when others had failed , -- '' a time-server '' in the best sense ; supported by white opinion ; who talks of duties rather than of rights ; con - structive , not critical ; quiet and diplomatic , not disputatious ; business-like , not heroic , is con - trasted with
Trotter	PERSON	, the extreme radical , who would insist on absolute right , yield nothing for expediency 's sake , and altogether disregard the opinions of whites .

		The estimate of Washing - ton and his policies is especially good . ''

		Few men have shown such power of development .

		... He avoided controverted issues , and moved , not along the line of least resistance , but of no resistance at all .

		He founded his ■ creed upon construction rather than upon criticism .

		He urged his race to do the things possible rather than whine and pine over things pro- hibited . ''

		Of the radical chief , he says : '' Mr.
Trotter	PERSON	is well suited to play the role of a martyr .

		He delights in a reputation for vicarious heroics .

		Being possessed of considerable independent means , he willingly makes sacrifices for the cause , and is as uncompromis - ing as
William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Trotter	PERSON	, however , lacks the moral sanity and poise of the great emancipator .

		With him , agitation is not so much the outgrowth of an intellectual or moral comprehension of right and repre - hension of wrong , as it is a temperamental necessity .

		Endowed with a narrow , intolerant intensity of spirit , he pursues his ends with a Jesuitical justification of untoward means .

		Without clear concrete objective , such as the anti-slavery promoters had in view , he strikes wildly at whatever he imagines obscures the rights of the Negro race .

		He has the traditional irreverence of the reformer , an irreverence which delights to shatter popular idols .

		President Eliot of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	,
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, and
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	are shining marks for his blunt and bitter denunciation .

		He sets himself up as the moral monitor of the Negro raee . ''

		Professor
DuBois	PERSON	, the other radical whose books on negro affairs have attracted wide atten - tion , began , the author says , as a calm scientific investigator , but under the influence of Trotter he became an agitator of the extreme type , one of the leaders of the '' Niagara Movement '' against color discrimination .

		It is the author 's opinion that Professor
DuBois	PERSON	is not suited to the role of agitator . ''

		He is a man of remarkable amplitude and con - trariety of qualities , an exact interrogator , and a lucid expositor of social reality , but withal a dreamer with a fantasy of mind that verges on the fine frenzy ... His place is the cloister of the reflective scholar . ''

		In the rest of the book there is little that is wholly original ; it is chiefly a new treatment of old subjects .

		The author calls attention to a fact frequently unconsidered -- that the rise of '' democracy '' in the South and the accession of '' popular leaders '' to power has resulted in greatly increased race friction .

		But , as he further says , in comparing the opportunities offered to the negro in
North and South	LOCATION	, -- `` It must be conceded that the Southern white man frequently displays commendable personal good-will toward individual Negroes who come within the circle of his acquaintance or control .

		In general , there is the widest margin between his avowed public policy and his personal demeanor .

		No reputable
Southerner	ORGANIZATION	is half as bad as Senator
Tillman	PERSON	talks . ''

		That religion is destined to be one of the strongest forces in the solution of the race troubles , is the belief of the author , who asserts that a basis for cooperation and mutual help - fulness will be found in the fact that nearly all negroes are members of the two great demo - cratic churches , the Baptist and the Methodist , -- a fact true also of the Protestant whites .

		The negro professional and business classes are developing rapidly ; a fact of more importance than the criminality of the lowest classes .

		The statistics quoted seem to show that city life is not good for negro man or woman , and that
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359 few opportunities are offered in a city . ''

		As one walks along the streets of our great cities and views the massive buildings and sky-seeking structures , he finds no status for the negro above the cellar floor . ''

		On the other hand , the negro '' by virtue of his geographical dis - tribution holds the key to the agricultural development of the South , '' -- the concentration of the race in the black belt , the '' Land of
Goshen	LOCATION	, '' being as effective now as it was fifty years ago to bar out white competition .

		So many opinions of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's negro policy have been recorded that it seems proper to allow this one : '' He is not permanently wedded to any one question as the dominant note of his career .

		He suddenly takes up a measure , settles it , and drops it , and goes in quest of issues new .

		And so in dealing with the negro he has established the principle but has desisted at the point df practical application . ''


Walter L. Fleming	PERSON	.

		Briefs on 2sew Books .

		In his latest book , '' The Bridling of S ^ u ^ T Pegasus '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- , Mr.
Alfred Austin	PERSON	has brought together a series of miscellaneous essays in criticism , -- one of them inspired by the recent ter-centenary of
Milton	PERSON	's birth , another delivered as a lecture some ten years ago before a
Dante Society	ORGANIZATION	, still another published in one of the English magazines while
Tennyson	PERSON	was yet alive , and most of the rest written appar - ently before the end of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's century .

		The first of the essays -- there are ten in all .

		and each of them must make interesting reading for all who find pleasure in the critical essay -- is on '' The Essentials of Great Literature , '' and is a plea for a return to first principles in the criticism of poetry .

		These principles Mr.
Austin	PERSON	conceives to be , first of all , melodiousness and lucidity ; and after these , the largeness of conception and the power that we asso - ciate with epic and dramatic verse .

		The dethrone - ment of poetry in popular favor in recent times he attributes largely to the neglect of these essentials in current criticism , though he holds that there have been other contributory influences at work , in '' the perpetual reading of novels of every kind , '' the increase of the feminine or sentimental in literature , and '' the febrile quality of contemporary existence . ''

		The sentimental note in our literature furnishes the theme of the second essay .

		The third treats anew the time-worn theme of
Milton	LOCATION	's likeness and unlike - ness to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fourth -- the most substantial and the most spirited chapter in the book -- deals with the relative rank of
Byron	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and is an attempt to discredit sundry of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's dicta in his famous prefatory essay on
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Austin	PERSON	admits the justness of
Arnold	LOCATION	's assertion that
Wordsworth	PERSON	must profit by the M boiling down '' process to which
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	sub - jected him in his volume of selections , but denies that this is true also of
Byron	LOCATION	; in like manner he argues , with much emphasis -- and , it must be admitted , with something of plausibility -- that
Arnold	PERSON	was wrong in contending that
Wordsworth	PERSON	reveals more of life than does
Byron	PERSON	, or that he reveals life more powerfully ; he also demurs to
Arnold	LOCATION	's judgment that a poetry of optimism is necessarily a greater poetry than that in which the note of sadness and discontent is struck , although he seems to contradict himself later in his essay on '' Poetry and Pessimism . ''

		Another stirring essay , u A Vindication of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' is directed against the poet
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	, whom Mr.
Austin	PERSON	calls to account for having once charged
Tennyson	PERSON	, strangely enough , with '' inaptitude for musical verse . ''

		The remaining essays are concerned with ''
Dante	PERSON	's Realistic Treatment of the Ideal , '' ''
Dante	PERSON	's Poetic Conception of Woman , '' '' The Relation of Litera - ture and Politics , '' and `` A Conversation with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in the Elysian Fields . ''

		The volume adds little or nothing to our stock of critical theory , is in no sense constructive , but in its insistence on faith in first principles and on loyalty to the masters it is bound to have a wholesome influence .

		_ 600 ** ' ^ ne amio8t ; simultaneous publication the problem of of two exhaustive investigations into woman ' * work .

		fa e industrial status of working wom - en testifies to the increasing and serious interest in the subject .

		Miss
Elizabeth B. Butler	PERSON	's `` Women and the Trades , '' published under the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	by the
Charities Publication Committee	ORGANIZATION	, is based on a close study of four hundred establish - ments in the '' niillionaire city '' of
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	in which the labor of women and girls was utilized , and includes a survey of the employment of 22,185 of those women and girls at twenty-seven trades .

		Miss
Butler	PERSON	's book is not a mere statistical statement of numbers , hours , wages , -- these things have been accurately ascertained and stated , -- but a sympathe - tic discussion of all the factors , social as well as economic , in the problem of women 's employment in
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	.

		It appears that less than
one per cent	MONEY	of the workers are skilled , while less than two per cent deserve the name of craftswomen ; twenty - three per cent do work that requires only dexterity , and of sixteen per cent not even dexterity is de - manded .

		This means that by far the great majority of the women studied are industrially helpless , -- that is , doing work which makes no demand on their intelligence and affords little opportunity for ad - vancement .

		Miss
Butler	PERSON	points out the serious con - sequences of this condition to the community .

		She shows that few -LRB- less than two per cent -RRB- get elsewhere -- in clubs , social and educational , or in other social organizations -- the training that is lacking in their work .

		One can not begin to indicate the important facts here brought out , or the ways in which the
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	community , and many others of which it 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, is a type , must begin the task of protecting women wage-earners .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	as a whole , women are engaged in 295 of the 303 occupations specified in the Twelfth Census ; and it is an inter - esting problem to trace out the beginnings of their careers as wage-earners , to see how recent a condition is their wide distribution in gainful occupations , what the conditions of their early industrial employment were , what wages they received , what were their hours of work and their surroundings .

		These things Miss
Edith Abbott	PERSON	's '' Women in Industry '' -LRB- Apple - ton -RRB- tells us .

		It is the most comprehensive and care - ful study , historical and statistical , that has been made of the employment of women .

		In it their industrial life is traced from colonial times through the period of transition from house industries to the present factory system with its minute division of labor .

		A general survey of the fields of industry in which women were earliest employed , with many quaint and amusing quotations from old note-books , records , and periodicals , is followed by histories of special industries , chosen because of their impor - tance , now or earlier , in the employment of women workers .

		An interesting conclusion from the gen - eral survey is that , contrary to popular belief , ' • the increase in the number of women employed in fac - tories has not meant the ` driving out ' of men , '' the proportion of women in the
New England	LOCATION	mills having steadily declined since
1827	DATE	, when they were nine-tenths of all the operatives , to
1900	DATE	, when they were less than half .

		The data which
Miss Abbott	ORGANIZATION	has collected disprove also another frequent asser - tion regarding women -- that they have only recently become self-supporting ; the early records show that women supported themselves before the era of the factory .

		The discussion of the problem of women 's wages confirms , in connection with the broad field of women 's employment , what
Miss Butler	PERSON	's study revealed as true for them in
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	: that for the most part '' women not only do the low-paid but the unskilled work . ''

		This volume is in one respect unlike
Miss Butler	LOCATION	's : one seems to detect in it a hidden brief for the '' cause of women '' ; while the other work , though sympathetic , is nevertheless impartial in its attitude .

		Together they are distinc - tive and important contributions to the problem of woman 's work .

		A Russian Admiral in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Captain
Vladimir Semenoff	PERSON	, of the Russian navy , in a book called '' The Price of Blood '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- gives some realistic and often harrowing details of his capture at sea , in company with Admiral Rojestvensky , in the late war between
Japan	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, and of his detention in hospital and prison on Japanese soil .

		The volume is a sequel to `` Rasplata '' and `` The Battle of
Tsushima	LOCATION	, '' from the same pen , but is of independent interest as illustrating the kind of tactics and gunnery , on both sides , that made possible the ■ easy defeat of one naval force by another .

		Captain Semenoff himself was disabled by severe wounds , and must be given credit for putting forth such strenuous resistance as was in his power ; but his narrative , perhaps not wholly with intention , reveals a state of laxness and incompetence in the Russian navy that fairly startles the reader .

		The narrative covers the period from the middle of
May , 1905	DATE	, to the sixth of
December	DATE	, when the author found himself back in
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, with the disheart - ening prospect before him of being court-martialed for dereliction of duty . ''

		Is this the price of blood ? ''

		he asked himself . ''

		Is it for this we have shed it ? ''

		The translators of the book , Mr.
Leonard Lewery	PERSON	and
Major F. R. Godfrey	PERSON	, have indulged here and there in English that may fairly be called peculiar .

		For example , on an early page we read : '' If but one of them had dared to evince his glee openly in my presence whatever , I think I would be able to clench my teeth in his throat till they would have met there . ''

		An interview with
Admiral Nebogatoff	ORGANIZATION	, after he had submitted to the inevitable and saved his men at the expense of his honor , shows the unfortu - nate man in a rather touching frame of mind . ''

		I had not the courage to do it , '' he confesses , in answer to the query why he had not sunk his ships and taken to his boats -- an operation that he felt convinced would have condemned three-fourths of his men to certain death ; '' I had not the courage to do it , and to this alone I plead guilty .

		I am sure you will believe it was not to save my own skin that I acted thus : I was the Admiral , and means would always have been found of saving me . ''

		The diarist im - presses one as a man of sturdy resolution and remark - able physical endurance .

		The conditions under which he kept his journal were extremely trying , to say the least .

		But to this difficulty much of the peculiar interest of the book is due .

		Under the title '' Some Wonders of Sr '' Biology '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Dr.
William Hanna Thomson	PERSON	has re - printed a series of essays which originally appeared in '' Everybody 's Magazine . ''

		Their aim is the popular presentation of certain medical topics not generally understood by the layman .

		In fact , if '' medicine '' had been substituted for '' biology '' in the title , a more just relationship between the cover of the book and its contents would have been effected .

		For while the science of medicine is certainly applied biology , the relationship between the applied and pure science here is not so close in current thought or usage as quite to justify labelling as '' biology '' a book dealing with such topics as abnormalities of the mind , infection , and the like .

		Dr.
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	is a fluent and entertaining writer .

		Four of the seven essays which make up the volume deal primarily with medical aspects of psychology .

		Here the author is at his best , -- though the traditional granum talis will not come amiss even here .

		The last two essays are concerned with very broad and fundamental problems of philosophical biology .

		Their titles are respectively '' Is this Earth the Only Abode of Phy - sical Life ? ''

		and `` The Nature of Physical Life . ''

		On the whole it is fair to say that these two essays
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 361 do not satisfactorily solve the questions they raise , although there is not to be found even a perfunctory expression of modest doubt on the author 's part as to whether there may not still be left something worth discussing in regard to these great problems after this book is finished .

		Indeed , Dr.
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's manner of dealing with the intellectual difficulties implied in the chapter-headingsquoted , in its mingling of genial but at the same time absolute certainty , and the smallest but none the less distinct bit of a patronizing tone , is much like that adopted by the old-school country '' doctor '' in his amelioration of visceral ills .

		The conclusion reached is that the earth is the only abode of life , chiefly because '' Man himself is alto - gether exceptional ... He is simply supernatural , and above all biology . ''

		Just what this really has to do with the questions under discussion , does not appear .

		But since the chief purpose of these last two essays is plainly to inculcate the highest moral principles , the logical non sequitur may perhaps be overlooked .

		Mrs.
Francis B. Gummere	PERSON	-LRB-
Amelia	LOCATION	as a StCMik
Mott Gummere	PERSON	-RRB- .

		in a volume entitled `` The Quaker in the Forum '' -LRB-
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , considers '' an aspect of Quakerism which , '' she says , with some excess of emphasis on the peculiar nature of her researches , '' has hitherto received no attention . ''

		The writing of the book was suggested , she tells us , by the question of a professor of history in a
New England	LOCATION	college , who asked when the Quakers obtained the franchise in
America	LOCATION	.

		In seven somewhat rambling and pleasantly anecdotal chapters , the civil status of the follower of
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	is discussed , with abundant references to author - itative sources of information .

		First the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	attitude toward the oath -- hardly a topic that `` has hitherto received no attention '' -- is considered at some length , with illustrative instances ; and then come chapters on the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	as a `` Wanton Gos - peller , '' `` The Quaker Franchise , '' `` The Quaker Citizen and the Law , '' `` The
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	in
Interna	LOCATION	- tional Politics , '' '' The Quakers and Mirabeau , '' and '' Quaker Loyalty . ''

		The fifth of these essays seems to owe its being chiefly to the fact that the writer has in her possession a silver cream - jug presented by Dr.
John Fothergill	PERSON	, a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	physician in
London	LOCATION	, to
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, upon the latter 's departure for
America	LOCATION	in
1775	DATE	; this chapter is less compre - hensive and general in its nature than its title might lead one to expect .

		The book is appropriately illus - trated , chiefly with portraits .

		Romantic career 0n .

		e of ^ most interesting and of a Frenchman unique of careers among Americans inthe Civil War .

		is that of
General Regis de Trobriand	ORGANIZATION	; and this career is commemorated in a worthy biog - raphy by his daughter Mrs.
Marie Caroline Post	PERSON	.

		One could hardly ask for more in a novel of adven - ture than is to be found in this book .

		General de
Trobriand	ORGANIZATION	came of a line of soldiers reaching back to
William the Conqueror	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was the first in these hundreds of years to enter a different career , and this because under the
House of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	the army was closed to him as a loyal upholder of the Bourbon line .

		Chance brought him to the New World in
1841	DATE	; he married a
New York	LOCATION	heiress and remained a loyal American , though by birth he belonged to the high nobility and could claim the '' sixteen quarterings '' that gave him position among the proudest , and in his boyhood had made him a page to the Bourbon heir to the throne .

		Re * gis de Trobriand excelled in many things .

		He could swim seven miles , and then row his defeated contest - ants back to the starting-point ; he was a writer of skill and superior style in both French and English ; a musical and dramatic critic , an excellent musician , a painter of reputation , a friend and companion of noted men and women on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		When the Civil War broke out , although he was in middle life , he offered himself to the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, and served with distinction throughout the war , rising to the rank of Major General .

		A volume of his reminiscences , '' Quatre ans de Campagnes a l'Arme ' e du Potomac , '' is a fine story of the cam - paigns of that army , and did much to shape French opinion on American matters .

		At the close of the war he was made a colonel in the regular army , and served on the frontier until he was retired for age .

		The story of this interesting life is well told ; an obstacle to the enjoyment of it will be found by some in their inability to read and appreciate the best por - tions -- letters , diaries , and the like -- which are in French and untranslated .

Priscilla	LOCATION	, of a eountett in Countess of

Dutton	PERSON	, constitutes a sufficiently bulky sequel to the '' Letters of Lady Burghersh during the Campaign of 1813-14 , '' which appeared in
1893	DATE	.

		The writer of both series of letters was , by birth , a Pole -LRB-
Priscilla Ann Wellesley Pole	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and a niece of the great Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	; while her marriage to
Lord Burghersh	LOCATION	, afterward eleventh
Earl	PERSON	of
Westmoreland	LOCATION	, a soldier and a diplomat , connected her with another family of distinction .

		Her familiar correspondence , thought by her daughter to throw '' a new and true light on much that has been misconceived , especially in re - gard to the formation of the German Empire , '' has the naturalness and varied interest that an intelli - gent and observing woman , residing successively at various European capitals and mingling with court society , might be expected to impart to her informal descriptions of her surroundings .

		As to the new light thrown on the formation of the German Em - pire , since her latest published letter is dated
1865	DATE	, and her earlier references to the hopes and plans of German unity are neither very numerous nor very startling in their revelations , the illumination can hardly be considered dazzling .

		But those interested in European history of the
last century	DATE	, especially 362 THE DIAL -LSB-

Augustin Daly	PERSON	's famous company of players , '' if the title-page is to be credited ; and a `` publishers ' note '' informs the reader that the Diary , written in 1879-81 , has quite by chance become available for publication thirty years later . ''

		It is printed ver - batim , '' we are to believe , `` with only such omis - sions as have seemed expedient for personal reasons , the writer having since become well known in another walk of life . ''

		Who the writer is , may furnish food for conjecture to the veteran theatre - goer ; but as the parts assigned to her by Mr.
Daly	PERSON	were always inconspicuous , and sometimes mute , there is small danger that her veil of anonymity will be rudely torn aside .

		Her first impressions of her fellow-players -- some of them , like Mr.
John Drew	PERSON	and
Miss Ada Rehan	LOCATION	, subsequently famous -- are of special interest .

		The tone of the Diary is good - natured throughout ; in fact , the daily entries are just such as a well-bred and wide-awake young lady might be expected to write under the given condi - tions .

		Play-going readers , especially if old enough to have witnessed the performances of the Daly company from the beginning , will find innocent amusement in this '' Diary of a Daly Debutante . ''

		, '' n title '' Chats about Astronomy -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		The title is an accurate description of the contents .

		Mr.
H. P. Hollis	PERSON	, the learned President of the
British Astronomical Association	ORGANIZATION	, may be pre - sumed to have knocked the ashes out of his pipe -LRB- if he smokes -RRB- , and to have summoned his stenographer that he might chat to him in more or less desultory fashion on a dozen loosely connected topics of astro - nomical import .

		Four of the chapters are about the earth ; the longest of the other eight attempts to give the reader an introduction to the constellations .

		Notwithstanding the chatty nature of these talks , the author has been careful about his facts -- an exception being the story on page 41 about what
Halley	PERSON	said concerning the return of his comet .

		There are evidences of careless proof-reading : on page 41 some Greek words have their accents and breathings in sad disarray ; such slips as '' Astrope , '' `` chartering stars , '' ``
Enke	PERSON	, '' `` Aquita , '' ''
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	- nas , '' '' Aldeharan , '' and '' Crommelia , '' are not very creditable .

		But aside from these minor defects , the book may be recommended to anyone who does not care for a systematic and orderly treatment of the subject , and will not miss the beautiful illustrations with which popular books on astronomy are usually adorned .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a new edition of '' The Works of Sir
John Suckling	PERSON	in Prose and Verse , '' edited by Mr.
A. Hamilton Thompson	PERSON	.

		The plays and the letters , when added to the more familiar lyrics , make up a stouter volume than one would expect .

		The original title-pages of the several publications are reproduced in facsimile , and there is a considerable body of notes . ''

		The aim of this volume is , among other things , to give a concrete discussion of ambiguity , to simplify the study of causal connections , and to treat with greater detail than is usually done the type of inference called circumstan - tial evidence , the nature of proof , and the postulates of reasoning . ''

		This is the programme of `` An Outline of Logic , '' by Professor
Boyd Henry Bode	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is an excellent treatise upon a too-neglected subject , and one of its most useful features is found in the extensive set of appended exercises .

		One of the best series of supplementary reading - books that have ever been planned is that published by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	under the editorship of Mr.
Percival Chubb	PERSON	.

		The readings are to be from the most typically American of American writers , and a volume made up from the juvenile books of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	opened the series not long ago .

		It is now followed by '' Travels at Home by
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' a volume of passages taken from the author 's accounts of life on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and in the
Nevada	LOCATION	of '' Roughing It . ''

		Two further volumes from
Mark Twain	PERSON	are soon to be added to the series .

		We bespeak a hearty welcome from school people for these books .

		To the series of `` Original Narratives of Early American History '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- the editor , Professor
J. Franklin Jameson	PERSON	, has contributed a reprint , with exten - sive annotations , of
Captain Edward Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's famous '' History of
New England	LOCATION	, '' better known as '' The Wonder - Working Providence of Sion 's Saviour in
New England	LOCATION	'' -- for that is the title supplied by the running headlines of the original edition .

		It is now forty-three years since the last previous appearance of this work , as it was given to the public with a learned introductory essay by
William Frederick Poole	PERSON	.

		Professor
Jameson	PERSON	has availed himself of
Poole	ORGANIZATION	's scholarship , and has con - tributed much of his own besides .

		He is himself a descendant of the author , which has lent a special interest to the task of presenting the work to a new generation of readers .

		A new edition of the writings of
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	, in English translation , is being published by the
Mac - millan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is under the supervising care of Dr.
Oscar Levy	PERSON	, and will comprise eighteen volumes in all .

		The following works are now at hand : '' Thoughts out of Season , '' in two volumes , respectively translated by Mr.
Anthony M. Ludovici	PERSON	and Mr.
Adrian Collins	PERSON	; `` The Birth of Tragedy , '' translated by Dr.
William A. Hauss	PERSON	- mann ; the first part of '' Human all-too-Human , '' trans - lated by Miss
Helen Zimmern	PERSON	; the first part of `` The Will to Power , '' translated by Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	; and '' On the Future of our Educational Institutions '' with '' Homer and Classical Philology , '' translated by Mr.
J. M. Kennedy	PERSON	.

		For readers who prefer their
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	homoeopathic-epigrammatic doses , we recommend the in little book edited by Mr.
A. R. Orage	PERSON	, and entitled '' Nietzsche in Outline and Aphorism . ''

		This volume is published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 363 XOTES .

		Mr.
Joseph B. Gilder	PERSON	, late editor of '' Putnam 's Magazine '' and long associated with his sister Miss
Jeannette L. Gilder	PERSON	in the management of '' The Critic , '' has undertaken the editorship of '' The
New York Times Saturday Review	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The interesting announcement is made of a life of
Bret Harte	PERSON	for the '' American Men of Letters '' series .

		It is the work of Mr.
Henry C. Merwin	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, who has been engaged upon it for several years , and has had access to unpublished manuscripts and other authorita - tive sources .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a revised edition of that sterling text , '' The Leading Facts of American His - tory , '' by Mr.
D. H. Montgomery	PERSON	.

		This book is par - ticularly well supplied with apparatus for the aid of both student and teacher , and has in a marked degree the merits of conciseness and accuracy .

		A lawyer 's brief for the existence of God and a belief in immortality is embodied in Judge
Lysander Hill	PERSON	's '' The Two Great Questions '' -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	:
Began Printing House	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The argument is based on a vast array of evidence offered by the processes of nature , and on the difficulty of explaining all the facts of existence by merely natural law .

		Descendants of the Scotch Irish , and genealogists of whatever ancestry , will be interested in '' Scotch Irish Pioneers in Ulster and
America	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Charles K. Bolton	PERSON	, Librarian of the
Boston Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	, a book which
Messrs. Bacon & Brown of Boston	ORGANIZATION	announce as nearly ready .

		The work has been in preparation for several years , and will form an important contribution to the history of American colonization .

		Among the interesting books to appear in
June	DATE	is a new novel by
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, dealing with the problems of modern life .

		It is translated from the Polish by Mr.
Max A. Dresmal	PERSON	, and is to be published by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same firm announces a new book by
Selma Lagerlof	PERSON	, the famous Swedish author to whom was recently awarded the Nobel Literarv Prize of 840,000 .

		The novel is entitled `` The Girl from
Marsh Croft	PERSON	, '' and is translated by Miss
Velma Swanston Howard	PERSON	.

		Professor
Willis L. Moore	PERSON	, Chief of the
United States Weather Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, has written a text-book of '' Descriptive Meteorology , '' which is now published by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	.

		It is an exhaustive work , abundantly illus - trated with charts and diagrams , and is designed for the needs of men in training for the work of forecasting .

		It may also serve well as a manual for advanced college students .

		We note with interest that the author is not to be numbered among the deserters from the Laplacian hypothesis concerning the origin of the Solar System .

		The most complete history ever prepared of an early American magazine is about to be published by the
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION	.

		It comprises the weekly records of a club of brilliant young men of
New England	LOCATION	who edited '' The Monthly Anthology and
Boston Review	ORGANIZATION	'' just a century ago .

		The book , which will be hand - somely illustrated , will contain an introduction by Mr.
M. A. De Wolfe Howe	PERSON	, a complete collation by Mr.
Albert Matthews	PERSON	, as well as extensive bibliographical notes of early books reviewed , and a complete list of authors of contributions to the ten volumes of the magazine .

		THE DIAL 'S THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY .

		ADDITIONAL TRIBUTES .

		The Dial continues to receive congratulations and tributes , from individuals and the press , on its Thirtieth Anniversary , just past .

		If any excuse were needed for adding to the full measure of appreciations printed in the preceding issue , it might be found in the fact that these also belong to the collection , as well as in their interest and the rarity of the occasion which called them forth .

		While others offer flasks of praise I bring my humble vial !

		Live long !

		Live long and useful days !

		May Fortune 's sun pour golden rays Upon the faithful Dial !

		Many congratulations on the auspicious event .

		The anniversary marks an era of fair and candid criticism , of honest and sincere appreciations .


Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	,
May 1	DATE	.

		I congratulate you on the
Thirtieth Anniversary of The Dial	ORGANIZATION	.

		I remember the Dial of the
Transcenden	PERSON	- talists , to which an aunt of mine was a subscriber , and always thought of it when I read your Dial , which I did for many years , and which I think has justified the words of the prospectus of the Dial of seventy years ago .

Washington	LOCATION	, D. C
May	DATE	S. I appreciate very much what The Dial has done for us and for many causes in which I am interested .

		The maintenance of such a journal represents a high form of public service , and I am not sure that it does not represent the highest form of public service now open to men .


Benjamin I. Wheeler	PERSON	.


University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		April ts .

		This note from a constant reader of The Dial dur - ing the thirty years of success you and your associates and friends are so happily celebrating has been delayed only to give you time to digest all the more important things coming to you .

		Yet constant readers are not without value , I take it , and their very existence is evidence of their appreciation , not loud but deep .

		The Dial , especially to one trained in judicial methods , is a balm as well as an education and inspiration , and my gratitude for the privilege of its comfort and instruc - tion during these many years would be hard to plumb .

		May at least another thirty be its and yours to bless with beauty and worth all the friends among whom I hope always to be .


Eugene E. Pbussino	PERSON	.


Chicago	LOCATION	,
May 6	DATE	.

		I wish to congratulate The Dial on its Thirtieth Anniversary .

		The Dial is one of the very few literary periodicals that I find worth reading at all .

		So from my point of view you have been greatly successful .

		You should take the foremost place among our periodicals devoted largely to literature .


Wilbub L. Cross	ORGANIZATION	.


Yale University	ORGANIZATION	,
May U.	DATE	I always enjoy reading The Dial .

		I like its com - mon sense , its good judgment , its conscientious fairness , its thorough scholarship .

		I will not call its deliverances oracles , but they give me a somewhat similar feeling at once of confidence and of finality .

		The Dial does tell 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, to all who are interested in culture and literature the state of life and growth that is now arrived and arriving .

		I join the generation it has helped and guided for thirty years in wishing it hearty Godspeed .

		Jacob
Gould Schubman	PERSON	.


Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	,
N. Y	ORGANIZATION	„
May 3	DATE	.

		That The Dial should be alive to celebrate the
Thirtieth Anniversary	DATE	of its birth should not be a source of wonder , but when one looks at the cheaper magazines and most of the higher priced ones , all of them grovel - ling before the raw intelligence of the masses , it is a wonderful achievement to make a success of such a publication as The Dial , and the credit should be in accordance with the achievement .


Isaac R. Pennypackeb	PERSON	.

		Saranac Lake , N. Y „
April 29	DATE	.

		I send my congratulations on the Thirtieth
Anniver	PERSON	- sary of The Dial .

		I wish to add my testimony to the abundance which you have received .

		It is now a good many years since I began reading The Dial , and no more welcome visitor comes to me .

		I appreciate espe - cially the generosity of its criticisms : those who are admitted into its precincts receive the best of greetings .

		May you long live and prosper .


Louis J. Block	PERSON	.


Chicago	LOCATION	,
May 3	DATE	.

		My very cordial congratulations to The Dial on the achievement of so long a period of consistent service to literature , and the hope that successors in my office may have the privilege of a similar congratulation upon the prolongation of this period to a full centennial .

		Hebbebt Putnam .

		Library of

Washington	LOCATION	, D. C ,
April 28	DATE	.

		My heartiest congratulations on your Thirtieth Anni - versary .

		The fine thing about The Dial is that it does not depend on another light , but adds to the literary world a lustre of its own , while marking the progress of that world .

		And this may you continue doing for another generation .


David Y. Thomas	PERSON	.

		University of
Arkansas	LOCATION	,
May 9	DATE	.

		May I congratulate you upon your admirable Thirtieth Anniversary number .

		I spent most of

Geobge W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
April 30	DATE	.

		I feel that The Dial is one of the few journals in the country true to the best ideals of literature , and a valu - able paper to the critical reader , the publisher , and the general public .


John Macbae	PERSON	-LRB-
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
New York	LOCATION	,
April 28	DATE	.

		We hasten to offer our congratulations upon your
Thirtieth Anniversary	ORGANIZATION	.

		A periodical that can keep its high standard for thirty years , as yours has done , deserves success .


Duffield & Company	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	,
April 29	DATE	.

		The Dial , which celebrates its thirtieth anniversary this week , is a literary journal of remarkable enterprise and independence , and Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	once declared it to be unsurpassed by any other literary journal in
America	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	.

		It was founded in
1880	DATE	by Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, who named his venture after the famous '' Dial '' which
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	conducted , and to which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	,
Thoreau	PERSON	, and many of the other
New England	LOCATION	transcendentalists , contributed .


Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's journal ceased after sixteen quarterly numbers ; but its namesake has had a longer , if not quite such a brilliant , career .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	is justly proud of the fact that he has directed its policy for so long a period , and that , though published in a city often described as the most unliterary in the
United States	LOCATION	, it is read all over the Republic , and includes among its contributors many of the most distinguished men of letters in
America	LOCATION	.


London Nation	ORGANIZATION	.


Chicago	LOCATION	has amused itself , and others , by announcing itself from time to time as '' the literary centre '' of the nation .

		This is an indefinite phrase , and the boast is as meaningless as it is harmless .

		The city has a few authors , a few publishers , and many readers of books .

		But in one respect it is unique .

		It has the only purely literary journal of the first rank in
America	LOCATION	.


May 1	DATE	The Dial celebrates its thirtieth anniversary .

		Begun as a monthly , it was changed to a fortnightly publica - tion eighteen years ago , and it is still under the control of its first editor , who has been associated with literary effort in
Chicago	LOCATION	for nearly half a century .

		It has stood for the highest ideals in art and politics , although touch - ing upon the latter only incidentally , and it has undoubt - edly exercised upon its readers a powerful influence towards better things .

		It has earned the praise of great authorities on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	for its unbiased judgments and its fearless independence , and its refusal to compromise with unhealthy and sensational tenden - cies in literature has won general admiration .


Chicago Tbibune	ORGANIZATION	.

		With the
first week of May	DATE	comes the issue of The Dial commemorating the close of its thirtieth year .

		During that long interval , a generation of human life , its founder , Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, has been continu - ously its editor , an achievement in personality and literary journalism that is almost without exception .

		For thirty years The Dial has come regularly out of
Chicago	LOCATION	, recording and commenting upon the passing and the permanent in literature with a just and author - itative voice .

		During most of that time , and at the present moment , The Dial stands alone as the only American newspaper whose sole object is the chronicling and criticism of literary achievement .

		May it continue in length of years and in wisdom .

		Boston Tbanscbipt .

		That admirable literary journal , The Dial , of Chi - cago , has just rounded three decades of continuous publication under the same editorial auspices ... Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	has been editor of The Dial since its first number appeared in
May , 1880	DATE	.

		For twelve years he issued the periodical as a monthly , but for the past eighteen years it has been a fortnightly .

		The Dial has never missed an issue , and its stability of manage - ment is almost unique in American journalism .

		Its editor has made us all his debtors many times .

		His has been a quiet but effective influence in the nation 's liter - ary development , which we hope may be continued far into the future .


Amebican Review of Reviews	ORGANIZATION	.

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 To The Dial , that admirable fortnightly review of cur - rent literature and vehicle of sound criticism , our hearty congratulations on the occasion of its thirtieth anniver - sary .

		Our personal congratulations , too , to its founder and helmsman , who has kept it steady on its consistent course by the polestar of duty to the best interests of literature in the main phases or relations of the term -- the author 's , the reader 's , the publisher 's ... By austere adherence to its high standards , by develop - ment on its original right lines , and avoidance of the commercial temptations that beset a journal with an ideal , The Dial stands to-day on an eminence of success and international recognition that vindicates the judgment of its founder and his faith in the Emersonian maxim of hitching one 's wagon to a star .


Milwaukee Sextixkl	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the whole three decades of its existence this unique and estimable literary fortnightly has been edited by its founder , Mr.
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	, whose strong personality and high critical standards have somehow achieved the apparently impossible feat of maintaining in
Chicago	LOCATION	the one purely literary period - ical in the country .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's success , like that of
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	with his orchestra , was due to no concession to popular lack of taste , but to a sort of stern enthusiasm for the best .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	and
Chicago	LOCATION	are alike to be congratulated on The Dial 's anniversary .


Chicago Record-Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		To have brought a literary journal safely through thirty years of life in
Chicago	LOCATION	, in a country not famous for enthusiasm over affairs of culture , is an admirable achievement .

		It is a tribute in part to editorial devo - tion , but more particularly to the probity which has dis - tinguished The Dial .

		Concessions have been made neither to the general preference for sensational litera - ture nor to advertisers ' desire for indulgence .

		This rare , standard has never been deserted , and the success of The Dial is good testimony that there are publishers and public who appreciate disinterested criticism .

		That such success may continue and greatly increase must be the wish of all Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's contemporaries .

		And
Chicago	LOCATION	especially must desire that this anniversary be the portal to even wider and stronger influence .


Chicago Evexixg Post	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Dial is to be congratulated upon its thirtieth anniversary ; but those who have a full appreciation of its high aims , a realizing sense of how firmly it has abided by the faith for sound literature , and how well it has performed its work in its chosen field , will hold with us that thirty years is but a milestone in a career which is destined to continue with honor for many years to come .


New Yokk Times Saturday Review	ORGANIZATION	.

		On
May 1	DATE	The Dial celebrates its thirtieth anniver - sary .

		It is pleasant to reflect that such a paper , printed in the West and devoted to the interests of letters , has had a life so long and a career so honorable and useful .

		The Dlal is one of the very few periodicals in the
United States	LOCATION	which has steadily stood for high aims and ideals , and in a consistent and dignified and fair-minded fashion kept its readers in touch with our literary production .

		There is special reason for congratulation that such a publication has been developed in the
Middle West	LOCATION	; but locality aside , the country at large should rejoice that The Dial exists , and bids fair to become a centenarian .

		It is one of
Chicago	LOCATION	's most distinctive and creditable institutions .

		The Bellmax -LRB-
Minneapolis	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The Dial of
Chicago	LOCATION	is thirty years old this
spring	DATE	.

		It is a high-class periodical , and it is no slight accomplish - ment to bring a literary periodical in
America	LOCATION	safely through so long a life .

		We wish it well , and hope it will live many times as long , with no loss of the cultivation and independence which have marked its history for three decades .

		Collier 's Weekly .

		The Dial deserves and will receive the hearty con - gratulations of the best men and women , widely scat - tered in space and in station .

		It has been true to the vision which called it into being .

		It has been an im - partial and sagacious interpreter of current literature .

		Uioty -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Every lover of scholarly criticism , of unbiassed opinion , of pure English , and of a sane viewpoint , will rejoice that The Dial has achieved its splendid record and maintained its high literary standard .

		The Graphic -LRB-
Los Angeles	LOCATION	,
CaL	LOCATION	-RRB- The Dial celebrates this month the Thirtieth Anni - versary of its appearance among the literary journals of this country , or , perhaps truer still , of the world , since its praise is in every centre of literary culture abroad as well as at home .

		An unusual circumstance of its history is that during all this time its policy has been directed by the same editor , whose rare gifts have been unre - servedly dedicated to the work of bringing The Dial to a place of preeminence among journals of its class .

		His reward is the praise of the discerning ... While The Dlal remains faithful to its present ideals and to its own splendid history , always will there be assurance of a criticism which unites sympathy and insight with the highest integrity .

Buffon	PERSON	and the rest are forgotten , personal intelligence con - cerning our temporary authors will be worth printing -- but possibly not till then .

		Yet woe to the literary magazine which in this our commercial country eschews all prattle of industrious pen - men !

		So , at least , say the daring souls who have launched periodical upon periodical only to see them succumb to the competition of the .

		newspaper .

		Only the
Bookman	ORGANIZATION	survives -- a sur - vival , we believe , due in a great meas - ure to the combination of journalistic instinct and literary taste possessed by ^ Mr.
Arthur Bartlett Maurice	PERSON	, who , in his always interesting '' .

		Chronicle and Comment , '' steers craftily between the Scylla of fatuous exploitation and the Charybdis of stodgy and sterile fact , rilustrations , of course , help the Bookman mightily .

		Could any pe - riodical , without pictures , live by lit - erature alone ?

		The answer is at hand : The Dial , of
Chicago	LOCATION	, dates .

		The Dial , of
Chicago	LOCATION	, lias lived by literature alone , lo !

		these thirty years -- conducted by the original founder , edited by its first editor .

		Nearly all the English reviews look to politics , to public af - fairs , , as well as to letter 's .

		But to let - ters alone is the Dial devoted .

		This month of
May	DATE	marks its thirtieth birth - day -- the natal day of a journal known seventy years ago as the Dial , of Bos - ton -- a journal edited for four years by
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	, and including among its contributors
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		Its continuous and prosper - ous conduct in
Chicago	LOCATION	, since its re - vival in
1880	DATE	in a course of dignity without dulness , and with a regard for timeliness without triviality , seems to us a very considerable achievement .

		Our congratulations to Mr.
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	-- printer , poet , lawyer , editor , publisher ; once a mere New Englander , but long and latitudinously of
Chicago	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	-- the bowels and red blood of our continent .

		The West is really a wonderful place when you come to know it ; and that has been our good fortune .

		NOTES 400 TOPICS LN JUNE PERIODICALS 402 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 402 AMERICAN AND ENGLISH PERIODICALS .

		Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	has a sharp eye for things American .

		Viewing us from afar , and sojourning `` in our midst , '' he has used it to good purpose , and has recorded in singularly clear terms the results of his observation .

		His vision is not altogether free from astigmatism , but it is both steady and penetrating .

		While Mr.
Archer	PERSON	is particularly concerned with mat - ters pertaining to his metier as critic of the drama and student of the technical problems of the playhouse , he is more than a specialist in this restricted field , and has envisaged many other scenes and situations .

		He has discoursed upon our manners and our morals , he has pre - sented us with a solution of our negro problem , and he has rushed into the conflict that rages about our spelling of the English language , -- not taking , we regret to say , the side of the angels .

		His latest contribution to our enlight - enment upon our own affairs -- and , incidentally , to the enlightenment of his fellow Britons by the method of comparison -- is found in a study of '' The
American Cheap Magazine	ORGANIZATION	, '' contributed to `` The Fortnightly Review . ''

		The study should please us , on the whole , because it redounds to the credit of American enterprise .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	says : `` Of the many differences between
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	which do not altogether minister to onr national self-complacency , none is more striking than the contrast between our sixpenny monthlies and the ten-cent or fifteen-cent magazines that crowd the American bookstalls .

		On the surface , the contrast is most humiliating , and though , when we look below the surface , we shall find reasons which diminish its signifi - cance , it remains , when all is said and done , a disquiet - ing phenomenon . ''

		In making this comparative study , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	deliberately excludes fiction from his purview , -- in the first place , because he seldom reads magazine fiction ; and in the second place , because he thinks it is very much the same in quality on both sides of the ocean .

		His inter - est is in that section of the contents which may be described , if euphemistically , as serious , in order to give it a name which shall distinguish it from the mere products of invention .

		Now he finds , broadly speaking , that the '' serious '' features of the English sixpenny magazines are 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, '' magnified and scarcely glorified tit-bits , '' and '' articles on everything that can pass the time for an idle brain , and can not possibly matter either to the individual or the nation . ''

		In the American popular magazines he finds , on the other hand , '' articles of absorbing and illumin - ating interest , '' the type of contribution which is '' a richly-documented , soberly-worded study in contemporary history , concentrating into ten or twelve pages matter which could much more easily be expanded into a book ten or twelve times as long . ''

		Of the group of a half-dozen or so of magazines thus referred to , he says : '' There is nothing quite like them in the literature of the world -- no periodicals which combine such width of popular appeal with such seriousness of aim and thoroughness of workmanship . ''

		Having introduced his subject with these general propositions , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	proceeds to the task of specific illustration .

		He takes some two dozen recent numbers of the magazines in question , analyzes their contents , and presents them in a classified arrangement .

		The lengthy list of titles selected includes such as Judge
Lindsey	PERSON	's '' The Beast and the Jungle , '' Judge Gay nor 's '' The Looting of
New York	LOCATION	, '' Gen - eral
Bingham	PERSON	's articles about the
New York	LOCATION	police , a group exposing the political corruption of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, a group upon the
Pinchot	PERSON	-
Ballinger	PERSON	dispute ,
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	's '' Where the Shoe is Pinched '' and '' A Tariff-Made City , '' `` A Carnival of Graft , '' '' The Negro in Poli - tics , '' `` A Continent Despoiled , '' `` The Ominous Hush in
Europe	LOCATION	, '' `` The Terror on
Europe	LOCATION	's Threshold , '' `` Barbarous Mexico , '' and `` Spik - ing down an Empire . ''

		These examples are taken from the political groups ; under the head of social topics we find mention of '' The Case against
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Blasting the Kock of Ages , '' '' The Godlessness of
New York	LOCATION	, '' '' Beating Men to Make Them Good , '' `` What Eight Million Women Want , '' '' The Bird Tribute to Vanity , '' and '' Divorce and Public Welfare . ''

		Still other groups cite '' The Vampire of the South , '' '' The Sacrifice of the Innocents , '' '' Does the Weather Bureau Make Good ? '' ''

		On the Trail of the Ghost , '' '' The Lure of Gold , '' and '' The Inde - cent Stage . ''

		We have given only a small part of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's list , but it is enough to make us understand why an Englishman should rub his eyes at the spectacle of a magazine activity which leaves the enterprise of his own country so far behind .

		But we think our critic takes the entire manifestation a little too seriously .

		It is true that these are all serious subjects , and it is also true that almost every article in the list is the product of an extended investigation and of an amount of labor far out of proportion to the ten or twelve pages that the article fills .

		But those of us who for a series of years have had these articles as a steady diet have come to realize that their fundamental note is sensation - alism , and that the underlying motive for their multiplication is commercial rather than phil - anthropic .

		The instinctive common sense of the American people has labelled them as `` muck-raking '' productions , and an instinctive optimism has discounted their lurid imaginings by about ninety per cent .

		They have stirred us up , no doubt , and often in profitable ways ; but their bias and exaggeration , their deter - mination to make sensational points at no mat - ter what sacrifice of sobriety , have prevented them from having much influence over serious - minded people .

		They have aroused emotional rather than reflective natures ; and this is a dangerous thing to do .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	thinks that these articles have been '' an incalculable force for good , '' of which we are by no means sure ; but he admits that they exhibit the logical weakness of '' an insufficient thinking-out of the fundamental ideas on which their crusade is based . ''

		To our mind a much more fatal weak - ness is found in their attitude of parti pris , in their assumption that everything is either black or white , and in their unblushing appeal to preju - dice .

		Some of them are doubtless comparatively free from these faults ; but since Mr.
Archer	PERSON	seems to cover them with a blanket approval , we feel bound to suggest that the opposing point of view is likely to result in a sounder judgment .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	wishes that the English magazines might follow the example thus set them on this side of the water ; and if they were to follow it in moderation the enterprise would probably be desirable .

		There are subjects enough for exploi - tation at the English editor 's hand , if only he realized his opportunities .

		The reasons why he does not make the venture are two in number , and are thus stated : '' The mildest of the progressive magazines , if its matter applied to
England	LOCATION	and were published in En - gland , would beget such a monthly crop of libel suits as would bring unheard-of prosperity to the legal profes - sion . ''

		Furthermore , the English cheap magazines `` have neither the circulation nor the advertisements which would enable them to pay for it .

		The American editor will pay more for a single article than an English editor would pay for the whole matter of one of his numbers . ''

		These reasons are pretty nearly prohibitive , as
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 we may easily understand .

		But if the English public can not benefit by the freedom -LRB- degenerat - ing into license -RRB- of our American editors , and by the gambling spirit which controls their expen - diture , it has its own organs for the discussion of serious public concerns .

		If we could support in this country a group of monthlies like '' The Contemporary , '' `` The Fortnightly , '' and `` The Nineteenth Century , '' and a group of weeklies like '' The Spectator , '' `` The Nation , '' and `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' we would gladly exchange for them the whole galaxy of our muck-raking magazines .

		Sobriety , in the long run , is more effective than sensationalism as an agency of reform , and writing that appeals to the intel - ligence has a farther-reaching and more lasting influence than writing that appeals chiefly to the emotions .

		THE CHARM OF GUIDE BOOKS .

		I have often wondered that in his catalogue of '' books which are no books '' -LRB- comprising '' Court Calendars ,
Directories	ORGANIZATION	, Draught Boards bound and lettered on the back , Almanacs , Statutes at Large , '' and other biblia a-biblia -RRB- ,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	did not include Guide Books .

		To be sure , there were but few such in his day .

		Travelling was expensive and wearisome , and the booksellers had but little induce - ment to forestall
Baedeker	PERSON	.

		Guide Books indubit - ably there were , but it is a question whether the gentle Elia ever held one in his hand .

		To-day , how - ever , every library of even tolerable pretensions has -LRB- not boasts -RRB- its topmost or lowermost shelf of red - covered books , mute and inglorious discarded com - panions of wanderings by sea and by land .

		A brand-new Guide Book is , at the best , but endured as an intellectual vade mecum ; a Guide Book out - of-date is poor company indeed .

		Now , perhaps from sheer contrariness , I want to say a good word for these cast-off fellow-travellers , these humble , dusty , upper-shelved volumes , whose titles are the indexes , it may be , of happy days when we were younger , and
Europe	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	and even the more distant portions of our own continent were still to us a land of dreams .

		I could dwell on the memories that are embalmed in these well-thumbed little volumes : on the faded ivy leaf that still marks the page devoted to Rydal Mount ; the pressed fern that grew • • in the crannies '' of the Coliseum ; the blood-red field-lily from the shadow of
Rachel	ORGANIZATION	's Tomb .

		But just now I am not concerned with the sentimental value of Guide Books , rather with their power to interest and amuse from an entirely imper - sonal standpoint .

		What more delicious reading for a weary brain than this local `` Surrey '' ?

		Opening at random , I find myself not far from Dorking -- ' `` an admirable halting-place for the pedestrian , who might stay here for a month and find a new walk every day . ''

		Then follow the directions for roads and foot-paths , '' along the ridge of the downs , '' '' over
Milton Heath	PERSON	, '' `` through the woods to Deepdene , '' or • • under the fir-clad Ridland Hill . ''

		The very names are soothing , and as we wander through English meadows and lanes the thought of pestilential prob - lems , of financial crises , of ward politics , are less insistent than the piping of the redbreast in the holly-bush , or the plashing of the waterfall by the moss-grown mill beside our path .

		For practical assistance in the matter of topog - raphy , history , and , to some extent , local color , the Guide Book is far superior to the gazetteer .

		Where , for instance , can so much condensed information as to modern or ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	be found as in the little red-covered volume which has been the butt of so many shafts of ridicule , launched by novelists who are not ashamed of drawing very long bows indeed ?

		If you want to learn about your own country , read one of those small German Guides , and be wise .

		Are you puzzled by a newspaper despatch from some obscure hamlet of
Norway	LOCATION	or
Austria	LOCATION	, your Guide Book , with its faithful maps , sets you right - In the older specimens of this despised class of literature are quaint directions and suggestions redolent of other days .

		My own earliest trip to
Europe	LOCATION	was in
1873	DATE	; and I remember that one of the first oddities I encountered was fractional silver , I having been `` brought up , '' so to speak , entirely on paper scrip , which was in use here between
1862	DATE	and
1875	DATE	.

		It is not surprising , therefore , to find in
Morford	LOCATION	's European Guide for
1873	DATE	the expenses of the trip reckoned both in currency and gold -- the latter , as is expressly stated , '' being at 120 . ''

		The traveller was warned that he u would always be charged for a whole candle '' at his hotel , `` whether he used it or not . ''

		At that time , probably not half a dozen hotels in
Europe	LOCATION	were lighted throughout by gas .

		Electric light , of course , was not dreamed of , outside of
Jules Verne	PERSON	's `` Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea , '' which was published that same year .

		In a White Mountain Guide Book of
1869	DATE	, the reader is told : '' Be careful , as soon as you arrive '' -LRB- at the
Crawford House	ORGANIZATION	, '' a large , new edifice '' -RRB- `` to book your name for a horse to Mt.
Washington	LOCATION	, as often all the ponies are engaged for a day or two beforehand . ''

		The Mt.
Washington	LOCATION	Railroad was opened that
summer	DATE	, but was not connected with the
Maine Central	ORGANIZATION	, the distance between the lower ter - minus and Fabyan 's being traversed by old-fashioned coaches .

		The carriage road was completed in
1861	DATE	.

		History , by the way , has been repeating itself in
1909	DATE	.

		The Western `` burro '' has been imported , and travellers have once more ridden up the steep old bridle-path from
Crawford	ORGANIZATION	's to the Summit .

		Do n't forget to book for a burro !

		Perhaps the queerest , quaintest old Guide Book I have in my possession is a little volume of about four by five inches , called '' La
Vera Guida	PERSON	per
Chi Viaggia	LOCATION	in
Italia	LOCATION	. ''

		It was printed at
Rome	LOCATION	in
1775	DATE	, 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, and is dedicated , in four pages of extra large type , `` All ' Illustris8imo
Signore Tommaso Jenkins	PERSON	'' !

		Who this most illustrious
Thomas Jenkins	PERSON	was , I have never been able to ascertain ; but I trust he was proud of the honor and of the sturdy little book in - scribed with his name .

		The frontispiece represents a post-carriage with two postillions , and a rider ahead lustily blowing his horn .

		There are many delightful maps , showing post-roads ; needless to say , the old - world geography of the country was practically the same then as now .

		Included in the general pre - fatory `` Instructions '' is a feature which I do not remember finding in
Baedeker	LOCATION	. ''

		A traveller , '' says the author , '' ought before all things to commit himself to God , without whose assistance every enterprise is vain . ''

		And , accordingly , a form for devotions is given forthwith -- a humble and rather touching little prayer for the safety of the tourist and of the dear ones he has left behind .

		A little further on are careful directions how to deal with wolves and bears en route .

		`` If the traveller has no arms wherewith to defend himself , he can escape from the peril by striking fire from a flint-and-steel , wolves especially being afraid of fire , essendo i Lupi specialmente assai timorosi delfuoco . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		June advice from the `` Old Librarian 's Almanack '' will apply just as well , or as ill , to this year of grace
1910	DATE	as to the year
1774	DATE	for which it was ostensibly written .

		On the calendar page we read : '' Stand not outdoors , gaping like a ninny at nature .

		She will take care of herself .

		Bead your books . ''

		Seasonable counsel , that , for those who have been stretching their necks and straining their eyes at all hours of the night in search of
Halley	LOCATION	's Comet .

		Halley 's Comet will take care of itself .

		In this
summer	DATE	season , with vacation at hand , there is danger of idle and otherwise unde - sirable visitors to the sacred precincts of the library .

		Note the following : '' No Person younger than 20 years -LRB- save if he be a student , of more than 18 years , and vouched by his tutor -RRB- is on any pretext to enter the Library .

		Be suspicious of Women .

		They are given to the Reading of frivolous Romances , and at all events , their presence in a Library adds little to -LRB- if it does not , indeed , detract from -RRB- that aspect of Gravity , Seriousness and Learning which is its greatest Glory . ''

		More in the same strain is added , but we refrain from quoting further , lest we get into trouble with the New Woman , the
Suffra	LOCATION	- gette , and other '' advanced '' members of the sex , and will content ourselves with one more excerpt . ''

		Let no Politician be in your Library , nor no man who Talks overmuch .

		It will be difficult for him to observe Silence , and he is objectionable otherwise , as well .

		No Astrologer ,
Necromancer	ORGANIZATION	, Charlatan , Quack , nor Humbug ; no Vendor of Nostrums , nor Teacher of false Knowledge ; no fanatick Preacher nor Refugee .

		Admit no one of loose or evil Life ; prohibit the Gamester , the
Gypsey	LOCATION	, the Vagrant ... See to it that none enter who are Senile , and none who are immature in their Minds , even tho ' they have reach 'd the requir 'd Age . ''

		With the advent of
summer	DATE	comes a blessed relief from the season of rush and worry , whereof that worthy bibliothecary , Master
Enoch Sneed	PERSON	has written : '' I am so be - pestered and bothered by persons insinuating them - selves into the Library to get Books that frequently I am near to my Wit 's end .

		There have been days when I was scarce able to read for two Hours con - secutive without some Donkey breaking in upon my Peace . ''

		Few librarians of the present day , how - ever , will be disposed to take literally Master Jared Bean 's advice for the
summer	DATE	season , -- '' Let no intruder put your ease in doubt ; lock fast the door & keep the rascals out . ''

		The Sunday-newspaper monstrosity is not without prospect of mitigation .

		We have long believed it must change or pass .

		There may be readers willing to spend their Sundays delving in these literary rubbish-heaps , -- the fact that they continue to be produced indicates it .

		But to ordi - nary self-respecting mortals , who want the important news on
Sundays	DATE	as on other days , and object to being compelled to traverse a wilderness of sensa - tional print and a morass of vulgar pictures to get it , the
Sunday	DATE	paper is a pest and a calamity .

		A good illustration , which we give at first hand , occurs to us .

		A prominent journalist was asked by his managing editor what he thought of a certain feature of
last Sunday	DATE	's paper ; to which the frank reply was given that he -LRB- the journalist -RRB- never read the
Sunday	DATE	paper . ''

		Do n't you ? ''

		said the managing editor , a bit disappointedly , -- adding , rather grimly , '' Well , I do n't blame you , -- I would n't read it myself if I did n't have to ! ''

		The encouraging news comes from
Boston	LOCATION	of the issue there of a modest one-cent
Sunday	DATE	journal , uniform in char - acter with the same paper 's week-day issues , and containing the news of the world , and a sufficiency of other matter , unencumbered with a mass of rub - bish .

		Mr.
Frank A. Munsey	PERSON	, founder and proprietor of many magazines , in adding a soberly-restrained
Sunday	DATE	issue to his `` Boston Journal , '' has rendered a service to newspaperdom and to the reading public .

		He well says in his first number -LRB- May 8 -RRB- : '' The
Sunday	DATE	newspaper is an illogical product .

		It is no more a newspaper than it is a magazine , or weekly paper , or comic paper .

		If we want a newspaper and nothing else , why should we be compelled to buy half a dozen other publications with it ?

		... If we want a magazine , why be compelled to buy a comic weekly ?

		If we want a comic weekly , why be com - pelled to buy a story-paper ?

		If we want a story - paper , why be compelled to buy the cut-out scheme for children ?

		If we want the cut-out scheme , why be compelled to buy a magazine ? ''

		The general
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 public , we believe , will be grateful for this relief , and gladly devote some of the time thus saved to the art gallery , the museum , and the public library reading - room , whose
Sunday	DATE	opening has not been facilitated by the prevalence of the time-consuming
Sunday	DATE	newspaper in its present bloated shape .

		Two aspects of literary leisure present them - selves .

		Its charms may be those of the siren -- seductive and ruinous ; or the delights of lettered ease may be productive of worthy works of litera - ture -LRB- a u Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , '' for example -RRB- impossible to one not entirely in com - mand of his time and movements .

		In the
Preface to Volume III	ORGANIZATION	.

		of the '' New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare , '' occur these words from the genial editor 's pen : '' Can we fail to prize the flashes of light -LRB- all too few -RRB- thrown here and there upon Shake - speare by Charles Lamb , that genius , wasted in the
India House	ORGANIZATION	, whom , had
England	LOCATION	known the gift of God , she would have pensioned bountifully and set to recording the thoughts these plays evoked in him that we might be brought into nearer com - munion with the great Poet than , with all our labori - ous verbal criticism , we have yet been able to reach ? ''

		But can one who knows the life of Lamb and remem - bers the barren tedium of his later years , when retire - ment and a handsome pension left him at leisure to record all the beautiful thoughts evoked in him by whatever means , fail to suspect that it was precisely that daily grind at the
India	LOCATION	House that drove his chafed spirit to seek relief in those exquisite essays that now delight us in the reading as they solaced him in the writing ?

		One of our most charming present-day essayists , not unworthy of mention in the same breath with
Elia	ORGANIZATION	, is the pastor of a large church and occupied with the varied duties of an extensive parish .

		`` What wise person would wish the author of '' The Gentle Reader '' set free to spin out his thoughts for us at ample leisure and in cold blood ?

		• • • An American season in the
London	LOCATION	book - market now cheers the heart and swells the bank account of more than one fortunate
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	author .

		Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	and Commander
Parry	PERSON	naturally create a demand for their writings wherever they go ; and the English circulation of their works is ac - cordingly very brisk .


Mark Twain	PERSON	's lamented death has sent his numerous British admirers back to their '' Innocents '' and their ** Roughing it . ''

		The death of another American , the self-expatriated author of the Saracinesca series of romances , together with the posthumous appearance of his '' Undesirable
Gover	PERSON	- ness , '' has made even more evident than before the favor he enjoys among English novel-readers .

		Con - sidering the number of Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's books and the speed with which they were produced , one must admit that even the later and less carefully studied display an astonishing wealth of resource and mas - tery of the romancer 's art .

		We long ago learned what sort of characters to expect from his pen , and what sort of conduct to expect from his characters ; but nevertheless they hold the attention to the end .

		Another
London	LOCATION	favorite of the hour -LRB- and perhaps longer -RRB- is Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, whose latest story , '' A Modern Chronicle , '' is having a brisk sale that is expected to be of some continuance .

		On the whole , American literature seems to be making its way .

		The reprehensible re-christening of books , which causes so much annoyance and confusion to the reading public , 60 many bibliographical blunders to librarians , catalogue-makers , and collectors , and such needless bother to book-dealers , deserves to be scored in the sharpest of terms .

		How many an admirer of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, for example , or of the late
Marion Crawford	PERSON	, eager to read every volume from the favorite novelist 's pen , has been betrayed by a mere difference of titles -LRB- in English and American editions -RRB- into buying , borrowing , or begging an already once-read , if not twice-read , tale !

		A late communication to the
London	LOCATION	'' Athenaeum '' touches feelingly on this subject in describing a case possessing some peculiar features . ''

		I have been comparing , '' says the writer , '' two novels by
Cleve	PERSON	- land
Moffett	PERSON	, ' A King in Rags , ' published by
Sidney Appleton	PERSON	in
1908	DATE	, and < The Battle , ' published by
John Milne	PERSON	in
1909	DATE	.

		I find that to all intents and purposes they are the same work rearranged ... Cases like this are very trying both to librarians and readers . ''

		A
summer	DATE	resort 's sumptuous library is about to be added to the attractions of
Great Barrington	LOCATION	, among the Berkshire hills in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The present library building in that beautiful town is unworthy of its environment , and its fine site will soon be occupied by a fifty-thousand-dollar structure .

		This may not mean that the butterflies of fashion who each
summer	DATE	and autumn make gay the streets of the old town will turn blind eyes and deaf ears to the lure of the golf course , the afternoon tea , the evening hop , and the loud-honking automobile , and will all become patrons of the public library ; but at least the permanent residents of the place will have the satisfaction of seeing their common stock of the world 's best books worthily housed .

		• • • The increased demand for
Mark Twain	PERSON	's books , since his death , is met by his publishers with a large reprinting of '' Life on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, '' '' A Tramp Abroad , '' '' Roughing It , '' ' `` Pudd ` nhead
Wilson	PERSON	, '' and '' Sketches Old and New . ''

		We sur - mise that the presses will have also to get busy presently with new impressions of ''
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	'' and `` Huckleberry Finn . ''

		It is an all too common experience among the frequenters of public libraries , to find no copy of either of these masterpieces on hand .

		The late Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	was enthusiastic in his praise of ''
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, '' and there have not been wanting others to rate the book as its author 's greatest production .

		Essays in
Divers Moods	ORGANIZATION	.

		* However stoutly it may be maintained that there is no demand for poetry and essays , yet the poets and essayists are not to be silenced .

		Like Garrison , they will be heard ; and it would be an evil day for current literature if they should weaken in this determination .

		The num - ber and quality of these essay-books and poetry - books continually appearing , and enjoying at least a very respectable public-library patronage , we must regard as creditable to all concerned .

		The light essay may lure the reader-f or-pleasure away from a too exclusive indulgence in novels to unexpected delights in other literary fields . ''

		Essays on the Spot , '' by Mr.
Charles D. Stewart	PERSON	, author of '' The Fugitive Blacksmith '' and '' Partners of
Providence	LOCATION	, '' is a book con - fessedly lacking the studied unity of a Greek tragedy , but possessing the inevitable unity of the writer 's personality and peculiar habits of thought and expression . ''

		My only experience with the Emersonian advice of ' Room alone and keep a journal , ' '' he tells us , '' had been in the middle of a
Texas	LOCATION	prairie under the stars in space ; and that is really room . ''

		Much of the dash and freedom of
Texas	LOCATION	cowboy life has found its way into these highly unconventional records .

		A typical example is to be found in '' The Story of Bully , '' -- the amazing feats of strength of a

		Here do we see , '' he announces , after quoting the opening lines , '' the great Power making the universe .

		And more especially the blue dome that is over all -- the sky and its contents . ''

		on '' The Study of Grammar '' is original and full of novel ideas ; but , again , we like the author better out in the open than in the study or library .

		In Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	's reprinted articles from '' The Morning Post '' we have a book of light and short essays conceived in the best of moods . ''

		On Everything '' forms a companion volume to the same author 's similar collection entitled '' On Nothing . ''

		As in the Hegelian sense '' everything '' and '' nothing '' are syn - onymous , the two sets of essays may be regarded as identical in theme .

		In seven or eight small pages to an essay , the writer discourses , in a friendly and sometimes intimate fashion , on all sorts of minor topics , choosing often the Baconian form of chapter-heading , as , '' On Saturnalia , '' '' On Song , '' '' On High Places , '' '' On Streams and
Rivers	PERSON	, '' `` On Old Towns , '' and '' On Rest . ''

		His praise of song is enthusiastic and not unde - served ; but when he goes so far as to say , `` Nor is there any pleasure which you will take away from middle age and leave it more lonely , than this pleasure of hearing Song , '' he underesti - mates the calm delights of reflection and silent observation that are the birthright of rational man as distinguished from that other vertebrate biped , the twittering bird .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's pleas - ing manner is too well known to need commen - dation .

		Miss
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	relates that from her earliest childhood her favorite exercise has been what might properly be called ligno - equestrianism ; and so , in a somewhat `` hobby '' mood , she gives us her opinions and pet enthu - siasms in a series of thirteen chapters , largely literary in theme , entitled collectively `` At the Sign of the Hobby Horse . ''

		Especially season - able is her essay on nature-books , though she does not refrain from a little mild ridicule of the fad-chasing variety of nature-students and nature-writers , and of course she has her word to say about intelligence in animals .

		In an entertaining chapter on children 's books she praises the late
Sophie May	PERSON	as '' the first realist among the writers for children , '' and relates how she herself earned the money to buy the '' Dotty Dimple '' series by denying herself butter for three months .

		She then deplores what seems to her a marked inferiority in the series succeeding the Dotty books .

		But she forgets that Dotty herself was the successor to
Prudy	LOCATION	; and there are to-day hosts of infants as delighted with Flyaway as with the earlier Dotty .

		Her book is fresh and vig - orous and worth reading from beginning to end .

		Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	's '' Rest and Unrest '' is made up of nine short studies in human nature -- rural human nature in an English setting .

		They are all pitched in a minor key , with the occasional sounding of a tragic note .

		Many a glimpse is had of cottage interiors and the inmates there gathered about the hearth or the table .

		Mention of a certain `` crowded meal of new loaves , seaweed ` bread , ' bacon , apple pasty , and plentiful thin tea , '' makes the uninitiated wonder what seaweed bread may be .

		Local color rather than action -- for little or nothing is really done -- gives this slender book its character .

		There is far more of rest than un - rest -- perhaps an excess of drowsy stillness -- in its pages .

		The Nature Virtues .

		* Although to people who are not enthusiastic over everything that is classed as '' Nature '' the nature-virtues may not seem virtues at all , no nature-lover has any doubt that they are pre - eminent among human qualities , and as precious as they are rare .

		The more widespread the fad of pretending to them , the more inimitable they seem to those who are conscious of possessing them .

		The first of these virtues is an original es ti - mate of value , quite at variance with worldly and sometimes even with scientific standards .

		Since the time of Agassiz , who '' had no time to make money , '' the real nature-lover has sacrificed worldly prosperity to the delight of his vocation -- or avocation , whichever it may be ; at least he has done this if circumstances were not too much against him .

		He knows quite well that a blue - bird is more beautiful than a bond ; that the * How to Stcdy the Birds .

		blossoming of a violet is more vital than the formation of a syndicate , and that it is a dese - cration to look upon growing grain with an eye only to the price it will bring in the market .

		He knows also that a live butterfly is more inter - esting and more important to science than many dead hippopotamuses .

		Consequently , if he lives up to his virtues he is more or less regardless of conventions .

		He does not affect sporting cos - tumes , but '' wears out his old clothes '' ; he rises any time after dark and walks in the most un - likely places to find out what the owl is doing , or to see the crow , when he wakes in the early morn - ing , `` yawn with that prodigious black beak after he has withdrawn it from under his wing , then stretch one wing and one leg , as birds do '' ; he forgoes his Thanksgiving dinner for a couple of sandwiches and a tramp on the seashore ; he stays away from the opera to hear the first meadow-lark of the season ; he takes his pet bear with him for a walk down the village street ; and he weeps , if he feels bike it , when the cat that has shared his cabin and been his friend for a season is spirited away .

		Such a person is , of course , a being of un - quenchable ardor .

		He can well afford to smile indulgently at the fancied nature-lover whose patience shows itself in sitting comfortably on a bank all day to see the birds go by , -- for he himself has knelt three hours in the mud to get a photograph of a marsh - wren , and has been protected from rheumatism by his fervor ; he has scaled a forty-foot pine-bole with disaster to his skin , to bring a bear cub down unharmed , and has spent days wading in bogs up to his waist in water .

		Crowning all his other virtues is that special quality by reason of which he is a nature lover .

		Call it what you will -- catholic - ity , sympathy , humanitarianism , tenderness , or love -- its touch makes the world of men kin with the world of animals .

		To it the destruction of life , except in defense of other life , is impos - sible ; and the vaunting of trophies -- except perhaps those of the camera -- is repugnant .

		This high quality is wholly democratic and in - clusive ; and though it may recognize the fasci - nation of a humming-bird as greater than that of a loon , or the beauty of a deer as more than that of a porcupine , it esteems and cherishes the individual traits of each .

		A small group of this season 's nature books exemplify these virtues .

		Mr.
Job	PERSON	, in telling us '' • How to Study the Birds , '' adds considerably to the tale of the abundant reward that has come to him in his loiterings in bird-land , and tells explicitly and fully how others may follow in his 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, footsteps and reach the same delightful results .

		The novice may learn from this volume where he may find nearly all of our common birds and many of the rarer species , how he would best equip himself , how he should manage his camera and keep his records , and even how to proceed in the delicate task of finding nests .

		The photo - graphs are many , and unusually beautiful , show - ing many birds '' caught in the act , '' which have never before been photographed in so intimate a way .

		The perfectly unaffected and very entertain - ing story told by Mr.
Wright	PERSON	about a black bear which he caught as a cub and reared to maturity is as good proof as one could ask of the pleasure to be derived from companionship with a dumb animal .

		Children will enjoy this book hugely , for '' Ben '' was a jolly , rollicking scapegrace , who had more thrilling adventures than fall to the lot of most children , and always kept his wits about him .

		The pictures of him in the vari - ous stages of his babyhood , and especially when he is learning to ride his pack-horse , are much more amusing than if they were of a human baby .

		The last half of the book is given to a good study of the black bear and his habits .

		Equally worthy of our acquaintance are the '' Wilderness Pets at Camp Buckshaw .

		- ' A crow , a raven , two bear cubs , a moose calf , two sea-gulls , and a porcupine , besides a cat , some dogs , and several young people , kept that happy spot enlivened through a
summer	DATE	, and , in spite of some prejudices among the pets , derived mutual benefit from the experience .

		There are good portraits of all the members of the demo - cratic family , and the story of their life together is a notable addition to the broader sociology which '' Uncle Ned , '' the leading spirit of Camp Buckshaw , was teaching his `` nephews and nieces . ''

		A book of specialized interest is Mrs.
Mabel Loomis Todd	PERSON	's '' Cycle of Sunsets , '' in which the author describes the most beautiful of the sunsets she saw in a year from her home on
Amherst	LOCATION	hill .

		The descriptions are well worth reading , and will have a useful influence if they encourage others to pay more heed to the daily pageant of the western sky .

		Mrs.
Todd	PERSON	weaves a college love-story into her experience of clouds and sunset light , and thus adds a human interest to her calendar of radiant pictures .

		A little book by Mr.
Winthrop Packard	PERSON	, which the author modestly calls '' Woodland Paths , '' gives very charming expression to the spirit of the true nature-lover .

		It shows no limitations of preference , except that it is a dis - tinctly
spring	DATE	book .

		Crows , butterflies , eels , bullfrogs , the brook ,
spring	DATE	dawns and sunsets ,
Ponkapog Pond	LOCATION	and the bogland around it , wild-flowers , weeds , and almost all the birds , are a part of life to the author , and he has the grace of words to convey the poet 's meaning which he gathers from them .

		A sense of humor is almost always latent , too , in his view of things .

		In explaining why the
March	DATE	hare goes mad , he says : '' Mad
March	DATE	winds are a good test of stability of soul .

		He who can stand their weltings with serenity , can watch his unanchored personal belongings go mad with the
March	DATE	hare , and still thrid the sombre boskage of the wood with sunny thought and no venom beneath his tongue , ought to be President .

		Even the
New York	LOCATION	papers could not make him bring suit . ''

		Mr.
Packard	PERSON	's '' ■ Woodland Paths '' lead , as he suggests the roads about Ponkapog do , '' from the land of humdrum to the country of ro - mance . ''

		Unpretentious as are the pages of his book , they stir in one the virtue of imagina - tion -- which also should have been mentioned as one of the chief of the nature - virtues .

		For example , he says : `` I never tramp these roads , which it sometimes seems as if the pudwudgies moved about in the
night	TIME	for the confusion of men , without being lost , at least for a time , and finding a new boulder to worship .

		Once , thus lost , I found a little gem of a pond , which hides in the hollows a half-mile or so east of Pongapog Pond .

		This , too , I fear the pukwudgies move about in the
night	TIME	, for I hear of many men who have found it once and sought it again in vain . ''

		THE DIAL 387 men have already learned by way of coopera - tion with those seasons .

		To sow , to reap -- of all the arts of man , these are the most sym - bolic ; and in right sowing and right reaping depend all things everywhere .

		It would seem to be almost an instinct -- the desire that leads a man who has grown a cab - bage or planted an orchard , or a woman who has achieved the art of bedding out a plot of hardy perennials , to set forth his or her experience in a book .

		The reviewer of even a part of the annual output of garden books must often shake his head over the problem of grouping into a well-balanced article the widely separated themes and styles which gather themselves on his table at this time of the year .

		Four volumes on the list now to be considered may be classed as pleasant and profitable hand - books for beginners in the art of gardening .

		In Miss
Higgins	PERSON	's `` Little Gardens for Boys and Girls , '' both style and matter are simplified to a degree which would make its pages a de - light to a child of ten or twelve years old who had a bit of ground all his own , a very little money , and an honest heart turned in the right direction .

		From Mr.
Rexford	PERSON	's long experi - ences in '' Indoor Gardening , '' many harvests have already been gathered .

		He has long sat as chief justice in a court of appeals to which countless readers of journals devoted chiefly to household affairs have turned in troubled hours , and from the endless questions which he has been asked concerning ailing rubber-plants or despondent geraniums he has learned exactly how to put into words the advice most needed by owners of a window-full of potted plants , or the more fortunate proprietor of a small green - house .

		There be folk who will gain more hope for the welfare of the republic from Mr.
Par	PERSON	- sons 's study of '' Childrens ' Gardens '' than from official announcements of many '' Dread - naughts '' or the convening of delegates of many congresses of peace . ''

		True and well-balanced conceptions of the great game of life '' can nowhere be more successfully taught than by observation of and cooperation with the laws that govern plant-life , upon which all sociological problems , directly or indirectly , depend .

		The inspiring pages of Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	's book have for their basis the work at the
Children 's Farm School	ORGANIZATION	at
Dewitt Clinton Park	LOCATION	in
New York City	LOCATION	; and so well is that work done that it is hard to see why a second book need be written on that subject for years to come .

		Into '' The Garden Primer , '' Miss Tabor and Mr.
Teall	PERSON	have condensed manv of the facts which all gardeners ought to know , but which many have yet to learn , the result being a handbook both pleasant and valuable .

		Good advice about soils , fertilizers , insecticides , and fungi-destroyers , outweigh in value the appended u Kalendar , '' which is not infallible .

		From handbooks like these , one turns to another world in the collection of verses '' In Praise of Gardens , '' compiled by Mr.
Temple Scott	ORGANIZATION	.

		The margins of its pages are not all that could be desired , but otherwise the setting of the poems is satisfactory for a book which is of a happy price that permits it to go on many bookshelves where the costlier volumes are barred out , and of a pocketable size which is an added recommendation for it now that garden - days are here , and there are those who can even read in gardens .

		On each alternate page a dial-inscription serves as headline , and the divisions into which the selections are grouped are also prefaced by dial-lines .

		The range of poets is both long and broad : Homer sings of the
Garden of Alcinous	ORGANIZATION	, Theocritus of later
Greece	LOCATION	, and
King Solomon	PERSON	his old Asian Can - ticle .

		The vernal melodies of Chaucer usher in the songs of the English bards , which extend from Elizabethan days to those of the king who has just laid down the sceptre of the island famous alike for its gardens and its poets .

		There are loved voices for which we listen here in vain , but the omissions are comparatively few when all things are considered .

		Still another anthology of garden verse is Mr.
W. A. Bradley	PERSON	's '' The Garden Muse , '' pub - lished almost simultaneously with Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's volume , noted above .

		The compiler in this case '' has simply sought to please himself , and those whose taste chimes with his own , by weaving a chaplet of choice garden flowers culled more or less at random from the richest and rarest pas - tures of poetry . ''

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	has a right eye and ear for the best poetry , and the bouquet which he has brought together is of a fragrance and diversity to delight every one who , either in fact or fancy , owns a garden .

		So comprehensive and scholarly a book as Mrs.
Cecil	PERSON	's `` History of Gardening in
England	LOCATION	'' has heretofore scarcely crossed the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to show us the difference between the best we can do in gardens and the splendid things of which the mother country can boast in countless instances .

		As the Honorable
Alicia Amherst	PERSON	-LRB- now Mrs.
Evelyn Cecil	PERSON	-RRB- , the writer of this noble volume has had the inestimable privilege of a life-long association with the great library of her father , known as the
Amherst	LOCATION	Library ; and in the 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, exhaustive bibliography which serves as one of the appendices to this history , she attests her familiarity with an astonishing number of the great old books of the great old English horti - culturists .

		We learn something of the sincerity of her studies from the short preface to the three editions of the work already published , in which , speaking of her preparation for decipher - ing the old English and old Latin -LRB- or Latinized English -RRB- of the deeds , leases , rolls , and other manuscripts necessary to her work , she says : '' I learnt to read the cramped handwriting and abbreviations of the old records I had to con - sult , by practising on the Wyklif ,
Northwode	LOCATION	,
Hampole	LOCATION	, and other fourteenth century manu - scripts , to which I had free access at my home . ''

		Some fifteen years ago Mrs.
Cecil	PERSON	was given the Freedom of the Gardener 's Company , and was furthermore admitted to the Freedom of the City of
London	LOCATION	-- honors almost never be - stowed upon a woman -- in recognition of her scholarship , as evidenced in the present work .

		As one turns these absorbing pages one sees the old-time life of
England	LOCATION	, political , social , and ecclesiastical , interpreted through its gardens in a manner wholly fresh and delightful .

		The '' brief island-story '' is told , not to the thunder of the captains and the shouting , but in the beneficent flowerings and fruitings which came of changes and developments of the national life .

		The Romans built walls that have crumbled and vanished , but a list of
Saxon	LOCATION	plant-names show how many fruits and vegetables they introduced .

		The
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	affected the common people through the new methods of horticul - ture introduced ; the Crusaders brought home strange Asian growths ; and from the wild sea - rovers many treasures were gained from foreign shores .

		The Tudors gardened very differently from the monks who had kept the gentle art alive through long ages , and the Jacobeans had yet other plans than those of the days of the
Georges	PERSON	and
Victoria	LOCATION	.

		Every great event that has affected
England	LOCATION	-- the Revolution , the Edict of
Nantes	LOCATION	, the Boer war -- has meant some - thing new , something beautiful , to the old gar - dens , whose yew hedges and pleached alleys have sheltered so many generations that the life of one man is but an incident in their quiet growth .

		Mrs.
Cecil	PERSON	's tireless industry has made it possible for us to identify almost every plant named by our oldest poets and garden-writers , and she has chosen her illustrations so fitly that they include facsimiles of ancient MSS. , plans and elevations of noteworthy estates , portraits of eminent herbalists , and photographic reproduc - tions of old iron gates , fountains , leaden statues , and topiary work , all of which may be studied with profit and delight .

		The great lessons which her book has for Americans lie in the noble use of evergreen hedges , in the salutary humility which recognizes that such historic gardens can never be for us , and a becoming gratitude that our friends across the sea hold their treasures in such tender reverence .

		THE DIAL 389 tions , a hundred and forty in number , selected from several hundred negatives made by the author , are likely to lead the reader to think that snap-shooting game in
Africa	LOCATION	is mere child 's play .

		The text will , however , prove that nervous prostration is more likely to follow the man with the camera than buck-fever is to attack the man with the gun .

		A charging rhinoceros at a dis - tance of fifteen yards may be an excellent target and a sure bag for a modern gun , but as the object of a harmless camera it presents quite a different picture .

		Yet Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	got one of his best photographs under just such condi - tions .

		At another time he and his companion set up a thorn-shed for protection , made prep - arations for '' flash-lighting '' lions , and when the lions came within three yards of the hiding - place , growling in a nerve-racking fashion and displaying fantastic shapes in the dark , the daring sportsmen not only released the flash - light but calmly went out into the field where the four lions were in concealed quarters , and re-set their apparatus .

		A typical passage in the volume recounts the photographing of a herd of buffalo , considered by African hunters to be one of the most dangerous of all game . ''

		I returned with the utmost caution to where the cameras were , and after making everything ready , crawled through the grass as carefully as possible toward where the buffalo were still feeding .

		In some way they had become suspicious , and were sniffing the air in a way that boded ill for me and my chances of obtaining any pictures .

		Not daring to go nearer than about 125 yards , I quietly lifted the camera above the level of the grass , focussed carefully , and with trem - bling fingers pressed the button ... Were they get - ting ready to charge ?

		and if so , what should I do ?

		I had no rifle with me , and my companion was some dis - tance away ; and at any rate , what would one rifle do in the wav of stopping such a large herd if they meant mischief ?

		There being no visible means of escape , I could see nothing to be gained by wasting time in conjecturing ; so I distracted my thoughts by taking another photograph just as one of the big bulls was bellowing .

		Then to my great relief they turned tail and retreated to the shelter of the deep forest .

		As they went I got one more picture just before the herd had disappeared . ''

		Though Mr.
Dugmore	PERSON	went into the African wilds primarly for just such scenes and pictures , his book has the additional charm that comes from a wide sympathy for all natural beauty and from a sympathetic understanding of man in his savage state as revealed in the native tribes dwelling in
British East Africa	LOCATION	between
Nairobi	LOCATION	and
Guaso Nyiro	PERSON	.

		Such a book as this , with its large page , clear type , and wonderful illustra - tions , will appeal to a far larger circle of readers than the multitude of books on
Africa	LOCATION	that are now finding their way to the reading table .

		Another book on
Africa	LOCATION	has lately appeared that is worthy of serious attention -- Mr.
Alfred J. Swann	PERSON	's '' Fighting the Slave-Hunters in
Central Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		The author 's residence of twenty-six years , from
1882	DATE	to
1909	DATE	, in the great lake region of the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	, makes him one of those who can speak with authority on the history of the overthrow of the slave - trade carried on during the
last quarter	DATE	of the nineteenth century by Tippu-Tib and his part - ner Kumaliza , together with other notorious slave-drivers .

		The primeval African wilderness makes a startling background for Mr.
Swann	PERSON	's account of his efforts to wipe out the nefarious human traffic which existed around
Lakes Nyasa	LOCATION	,
Tanganyika	LOCATION	, and
Victoria Nyanza	PERSON	, and of his ultimate success in establishing a rigid patrol and a protectorate for the hapless natives .

		The human element in this tragic drama played for so long a time in
Central Africa	LOCATION	assumes almost heroic proportions in the great trades .

		Mr.
Swann	PERSON	's account of African development will enlighten many readers , both missionaries and others , who have followed
Livingstone	PERSON	's and
Moffat	PERSON	's accounts of their efforts to heal ''
Africa	LOCATION	's open sore '' in the British dominions .

		The sumptuous volume entitled u Peaks and Glaciers of
Nun Kun	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.
Fanny Bullock Workman	PERSON	and Dr.
William Hunter Workman	PERSON	, will appeal particularly to those who have scaled high places on the globe .

		Students of geography too will find the present volume , like all the well-written narratives of these famous mountain - climbers , bristling with statistics of that little - known group of mountains lying about a hundred miles east of
Srinagar	LOCATION	, in the
Province of Suru	ORGANIZATION	, southwest of
Ladakh	LOCATION	and northwest of Zaskar in the
Himalayan	LOCATION	region .

		These mountains were first seen by the authors in
1898	DATE	, when they were making another exploration in
Northern Ladakh	LOCATION	; but their determination to explore the wondrous snow-bedazzled rock-peaked range was postponed until
1906	DATE	, when they succeeded in making more extensive discoveries and more accurate investigations of the Nun Kun range than any other explorers have succeeded in doing .

		Airs .

		Workman 's ascent of
Pinnacle Peak	ORGANIZATION	is a record ascent for women -- twenty - three thousand and three hundred feet . ''

		It was indeed , '' says Mrs.
Workman	PERSON	, in speaking of the septette of great peaks rising in solemn majesty in the weird crepuscular light , `` a D'dmmerung of the mountain-gods , different in meaning from
Wagner	PERSON	's G ` otter 'd ` dmmerung , yet filled with the same spirit as that which inspires his finest Xibelungen music , the deep 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, significance of Nature . ''

		Four sleepless nights , an excessive scarcity of oxygen , a diet of granu - lar kola , and a temperature ranging from high
summer	DATE	heat to below-zero cold , with the resul - tant depressing mental and physical difficulties , made up some of the personal cost for this glo - rious sight in the dwelling-place of the gods .

		Ninety-two superior illustrations of mountain scenery enhance the beauty and interest of the work .

		Mr.
Paul Niedieck	PERSON	's volume entitled '' With Rifle in Five Continents , '' published last year , was apparently so well received that the author hastened to publish his more recent experiences in
Siberia	LOCATION	and
Alaska	LOCATION	in a book having the title '' Cruises in the
Bering Sea	LOCATION	. ''

		This account is different from that recorded in his first book , in that it deals more with ethnological observa - tions and with the natural resources of the countries traversed .

		Nevertheless , the author -- who may be fittingly characterized as one of the globe-chasing Nimrods now so numerous -- is best seen in his natural guise of a mighty hunter .

		After a not uninteresting account of his voyage from
Seattle	LOCATION	to
Japan	LOCATION	, he takes us bear-hunting with him - in
Kamschatka	LOCATION	, thence to
Marsovga Bay	LOCATION	after bighorn sheep , and on to Petropanlovsky and
Anadyr	LOCATION	to
Cape Meech	LOCATION	- ken after walrusses -- the latter quest , however , meeting with no success .

		This part of Mr.
Niedieck	PERSON	's book is marked by such a remarkable tale of things going awry that it makes uncom - monly good reading , for the author is not at all reluctant to lay the blame on other shoulders than his own .

		The second part of the book , which relates to
Alaska	LOCATION	, tells about the history and development of that land , its mythology , in - dustries -LRB- especially gold-mining -RRB- salmon-fishing and fox-breeding , and the manners and customs of the nations .

		The last part of the book tells the story of the author 's adventures in the moose country .

		Though he makes lamentable moans for the continued mishaps that befell him during his seven months ' trip in
Siberia	LOCATION	and
Alaska	LOCATION	, he may rest assured that his second book has gained such strength of structure and breadth of view that it is far superior to the rambling discursiveness of his first attempt .

		Mr.
Harry A. Franck	PERSON	's unusually interesting volume , '' A Vagabond Journey Around the World , '' is a venture in the field of those famous student-tramps ,
Flint	LOCATION	and
Wyckoff	PERSON	.

		After some varied experiences as a tramp in vacation-time , during his college days at
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, he planned a two-years trip around the world , of which he says : '' The chief object of investigation being the masses , I made no attempt during the journey to rise above the estate of the common laborer .

		My plan included no fixed itinerary .

		The details of route I left to chance and the exigencies of circumstances .

		Yet this random wandering brought me to as many famous spots as any victim of a • personally conducted ' tour could demand ; and , in addition , to many corners unknown to the regu - lar tourist '' With but scant equipment of means for the journey , but with the merry heart and stout will that characterizes the true vagabond , the author made his way from
Detroit	LOCATION	to
Glasgow	LOCATION	by tending cattle ; earned his living in Mar - seilles as a stevedore and `` handy man '' ; shipped as a sailor to
Port Said	LOCATION	, where he pounded beans for a living ; acted as interpre - ter , scribe , and guide in
Beirut	LOCATION	, and as a trans - lator in
Jerusalem	LOCATION	; ran errands in
Cairo	LOCATION	; played the circus clown in
Colombo	LOCATION	; inspected the street-cars in
Madras	LOCATION	; '' fagged '' on the tennis - courts at
Delhi	LOCATION	; worked as a general laborer in
Calcutta	LOCATION	,
Burma	LOCATION	,
Yokohama	LOCATION	; and made his way home as a sailor , and landed in
Chicago	LOCATION	as a cattle-tender .

		His conclusion is that '' A man can girdle the globe without money , weapons , or baggage . ''

		Few books of travel will hold the reader 's attention closer and set his emotions astir quicker than this one .

		Miss
Mary H. Fee	PERSON	was one of the host of school-teachers who followed the flag into the
Philippines	LOCATION	; but , unlike many of her associ - ates , she had the fortitude to remain there long enough to gather more than surface impressions .

		A decade of work in the islands , chiefly at
Capiz	LOCATION	and
Manila	LOCATION	, enabled her to gather sufficient interesting and instructive material to write her book of '' A Woman 's Impressions of the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines . ''

		Though Miss Fee has a goodly amount of humor -- an excellent thing in a school-teacher -- and plentifully sprinkles her volume with it in describing her ardent endeavors to engraft western civilization on the hybrid native stock , she dwells at length on the greater problems of the political , religious , social , and industrious conditions of the Filipinos .

		American readers generally , at this season of the year , will be ready to agree with Miss Fee that the future of
the Philippines	LOCATION	is more likely to be determined by the introduction of the great American game of base-ball than by the insistance that the Filipino youngsters should learn to sing '' My Country 't is of Thee ' ' every morning !

		Were old
Fletcher of Saltoun	ORGANIZATION	to revise his statement , he might say , '' Let me make the games of a nation , and I care not who makes its songs . ''

		But Miss Fee , after a furlough in
America	LOCATION	, is quite content that

		THE DIAL 391 the `` hurry-up '' ideas of her native land should remain there ; for she finds the
Philippines	LOCATION	a pleasing place -- `` a maSana country , a fair , sunny land , where rapid transportation and sky - scrapers do not exist . ''

		Her conclusion is , how - ever , that this fair land , now wavering between American domination and the growing national sentiment for independence , with the possibility of Japanese guns some fine morning awaken - ing the echoes of
1898	DATE	in
Manila Bay	LOCATION	, is in a very unenviable position .

		Miss Fee 's volume adds nothing particularly new to our knowledge of the people of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, but it is not unworthy of having a place among the books pertaining to our foreign possessions .

		Very fittingly , Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	has dedicated his book entitled `` The Ship-Dwellers '' to ``
Mark Twain	PERSON	, Hero of my Childhood , In - spiration of my Youth , Friend of These Later Years . ''

		In his introductory chapter the author tells of the influence that
Mark Twain	PERSON	's '' In - nocents Abroad '' exerted on his boyish imagi - nation , and how as he grew older he learned that the track of the Innocents might be a reality for him .

		This possibility was made a certainty one day when he heard that '' the
S. S. Grosser Kurfurst	PERSON	would set out on her cruise to the Orient with two tons of dressed chicken and four thousand bottles of champagne . ''

		The days at sea remind the author , and to some small extent the reader , of the days that the lamented author of the greater book spent in that questionable pleasure .

		Then we pass with Mr.
Paine	PERSON	through his humorous account of his progress along the shores of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, to
Algiers	LOCATION	,
Malta	LOCATION	,
Athens	LOCATION	, into the Dardanelles , to
Ephesus	LOCATION	, into
Syria	LOCATION	, down to
Damascus	LOCATION	, following in the steps of the pilgrims of yesterday and to-day , to
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, thence to
Egypt	LOCATION	, and home again .

		When Mr.
Paine	PERSON	writes of his personal experi - ences , and those of his companions , he is capitally diverting and original .

		The many pages of seri - ous matter in the book are uncommonly instruc - tive , so much so that we wish the author had not followed in his humorous master 's tracks with such painfully short legs . ''

		I am merely a reporter of impressions , '' is the remark written by Miss Grace
Maxine Stein	PERSON	on the title-page of her book , '' Glimpses Around the World through the Eyes of a Young American . ''

		When one starts from
Chicago	LOCATION	for a trip around the world via the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	of the
Colorado	LOCATION	, the Flowery KiDgdom , '' The Core of Conservatism '' -LSB-
China	LOCATION	-RSB- , '' The Pearl Drop in

Italy	LOCATION	-RSB- , thence through a series of properly adjectived lands , back to '' The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave , '' and when one with equal propriety fortifies oneself with fitting or fitful quotations from the world 's great classics , then one may very rightly call one 's observations impressions .

		Unkind persons may describe these impressions as gossipy ; while those who have a blunter way of putting things , but a more intelligent way of looking at them , may be inclined to associate the impressions with that cosmopolitan dish called '' chop suey . ''

		For our part , we are disposed to apply that much overworked word , naive , to
Miss Stein	PERSON	's impressions of the world as she saw it , -- with the reservation that she makes no attempt to solve the world-problems as they presented themselves to her wondering eyes .

		If any reader of books of travel has never read a book about a trip around the world , he may as well begin with this one .

		It will introduce him to the facts and the fictions of the notable objects on the globe with sufficient accuracy and with a corresponding appeal to the emotions , so that he may continue to read more about the world without impaired mental indigestion .

		In the volume entitled '' Our Search for a Wilderness '' we find '' an account of two orni - thological expeditions to
Venezuela	LOCATION	and to Brit - ish
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
C. William Beebe	PERSON	, curator of ornithology in the
New York Zoological Park	LOCATION	, and his wife ,
Mary Blair Beebe	PERSON	, the grand - daughter of
Roger A. Pryor	PERSON	.

		The first of these expeditions , made in
1908	DATE	, was up the
Orinoco Delta	ORGANIZATION	into the unknown mangrove jungles , thence to the great pitch-lake La Brea .

		In
1909	DATE	these enthusiastic bird-hunters made three trips from
Georgetown	LOCATION	: one to
Hoorie Creek	LOCATION	in the northwest ; another on the Areniu and the Little Areniu in
Central Guiana	LOCATION	, and the third to the southern Savannas .

		More than three hundred and forty living birds , of sixty-five species , were captured and placed in the zoolog - ical collection .

		The authors carry something of the brilliant coloring of their tropical sur - roundings into their narrative .

		Their stories of the hunting ants , the wonderful butterflies , the talon-winged hoatzil bird of the mangrove wilderness , the song of the quadrille bird , the strutting of the curassow , the flight of the scar - let ibis , the penetrating cries of the wilderness of monkeys , and the multitude of things that make life a constant surprise in a land but little ex - 392 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Up the Orinoco and down the Magdalena , '' by Dr.
H. J. Mozans	PERSON	, is '' the record of a jour - ney made to islands and lands that border the
Caribbean	LOCATION	and to the less frequented parts of
Venezuela	LOCATION	and
Colombia	LOCATION	. ' '

		Our general impres - sion is that
South America	LOCATION	is a land teeming with a variegated animal life ; but the author , after spending a year in the land , dissipates that impression into thin air . ''

		Nowhere along the
Orinoco	LOCATION	, the Meta , the
Magdalena	LOCATION	, or elsewhere , did we ever catch even a glimpse of a jaguar or a puma , a manati or a sloth , a wild cat or a wild pig .

		More than this , not once during our entire trip through
Venezuela	LOCATION	and
Colombia	LOCATION	, through forests and plains , did we ever see a single monkey , except two or three that were kept as pets by the natives . ''

		The birds , too , which we have always imagined as clouding the sky , the author informs us are conspicuously absent .

		The uncommon interest of this book will cause its readers to desire to see the author 's next volume , to be entitled '' Along the Andes and down the
Amazon	LOCATION	, '' which is promised by Dr.
Mozans	PERSON	in his preface .

		The journeys of Sir
Francis Vane	PERSON	, recounted in his attractively printed book entitled `` Walks and People in
Tuscany	LOCATION	, '' were a continuous tri - umphal procession '' of quite the best sausages I have eaten . ''

		Seemingly , all out-of-the-way quaint old towns lost their picturesqueness un - less they accorded the author the welcome of Montemignajo : '' We arrived there certainly as prepared to enjoy the pleasures of lunch as the more aesthetic pleasures of landscape . ''

		The twenty-five chapters of the book centre around
Florence	LOCATION	and
Bagna	LOCATION	di
Lucca	LOCATION	.

		Each chapter concludes with a short predigested account of roads and personally-tested inns .

		Practically all of Sir
Francis	PERSON	's walks took him to little - known communities -- to
Tucecchio	LOCATION	, the home - land of the Bonapartes ; to
Ferrara	LOCATION	, with its ideal castle ; to
Montelupo	LOCATION	, the place where the monster she-wolf -LRB- whence the name -RRB- once saved the inhabitants from destruction ; to
San Martino	LOCATION	, an imperium in imperio , the only existing example of a fourteenth century Italian republic ; and to
Turrite di Cava	ORGANIZATION	, with its pas - toral mystery play .

		Here and there in the book Sir
Francis	PERSON	rises to the height of his sub - ject , especially when he points out some vivid contrast between the Old and the
New Italy	LOCATION	; and he tells us much of interest about this secluded region little travelled and undefiled by tourists .

		Mr.
George Kennan	PERSON	's '' Tent-Life in
Siberia	LOCATION	'' is now a classic in the literature of travel .

		First published in
1870	DATE	, the work has since gone through many editions in the old familiar blue binding , until now it is reissued in a more befitting dress , with a new preface , new illus - trations , and some new subject-matter .

		This revised edition contains about fifteen thou - sand added words -- '' including ' Our Narrow - est Escape ' and ' The
Aurora	LOCATION	of the Sea , ' and it also describes , for the first time , the incidents and adventures of a winter journey overland from the
Okhotsh Sea	LOCATION	to the
Volga River	LOCATION	-- a straightaway sleighride of more than five thou - sand miles . ''

		The illustrations are from paint - ings made by Mr.
George A. Frost	PERSON	, who was with Mr.
Kennan	PERSON	on his expedition , and from photographs taken by Messrs.
Jochelson	PERSON	and
Borgoras	PERSON	, two Russian political exiles .

		If unique experiences by field and flood , unusual hard - ships in a detestable land , hazardous explorations among a strange people , and a keen apprecia - tion of the various natural scenery of
Siberia	LOCATION	, attract the present generation of readers of books of travel , then this new edition of an old favorite is worthy of its new dress .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's book on `` The Pic - turesque St. Lawrence '' sets forth the story of the settlements along the great river , and details the historical settings that lend such an awe - inspiring aspect to the river from
Lake Ontario	LOCATION	to the
Gulf	LOCATION	, a distance of seven hundred miles .

		It is hardly necessary to add that Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's own illustrations greatly enhance the value and interest of the book , which is one of the excellent volumes in the '' Picturesque River Series
H. E. COBLENTZ	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Francis H. Alien	PERSON	, who was associated with Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	in the editing of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's complete Journal , has brought together in a volume entitled '' Notes on New England Birds '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	J all of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's references to bird-life to be found in the fourteen volumes of the Journal .

		As Mr.
Allen	PERSON	points out ,
Thoreau	PERSON	was a writer before all else , -- a describer rather than an observer , one too intent on analogy to become a trained scientist ; and so for scientific accur - acy we must go to other and duller writers .

		But we can never go elsewhere for the finer and rarer qualities that permeate his work .

		To have collected these scattered bird notes into a single compact vol - ume is a service for which nature-lovers should be grateful .

Eecext Fiction	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is quite safe to say of Mr.
Thurston	PERSON	's u
Sally Bishop	PERSON	'' that it is not a work to be recommended for the reading of the young person .

		The more difficult question of its fitness for the older person , presumably fortified by virtuous principle and knowl - edge of human wickedness , can not be given so simple an answer .

		It belongs to a large class of books constructed upon a too familiar formula .

		A young woman sins , and discovers the consequences to be more serious than she had reckoned upon their be - coming .

		She is just weak enough to make the sin inevitable , the impelling circumstances being given ; and from the time of her lapse to the tragic ending , the writer 's every effort is bent to the task of making her a sympathetic figure , and of weakening the props of our moral judgment .

		She is so good in most respects , and her seducer is so far from being a villain of melodrama , and the cry of her soul for happiness is so poignantly voiced , and the whole bewildering entanglement is set forth with such art - fully sentimental sophistry , that the most austere reader is in danger of being beguiled from his ad - herence to the elementary standards of conduct , and forced almost against his will to condone the woman 's offence .

		This is the subtlest form of immorality , and its corrosive influence affects a large share of our modern fiction ; the present example is more notable than most others because of the unusual power which it displays in the analysis of motive and the portrayal of character .

		As far as most of the attributes of artistic fiction are concerned , it comes near to being a great novel ; but the canker is at its heart .

		Unless we are to take refuge in the com - fortable doctrine that there is no such thing as sin in ly Bishop .

		any absolute sense , and that the demand for expi - ation is a morbid self-delusion , we are bound to condemn the treatment given the theme in all such works as ''
Sally Bishop	PERSON	, '' and to resent the effort to make us substitute sentimental for ethical standards in our theories of conduct It will doubtless be replied that all this is begging the question ; for our modern thinking is so permeated with hedonism that the very rocks of principle have become slippery , and all the categorical imperatives of old-fashioned morality are marks for the shafts of skepticism .

		But we are still confident that the marks are not as '' easy '' as they seem to their light-hearted assail - ants .

		We notice that Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	now classifies his works of fiction as '' romances '' and M novels . ''

		The former group includes all the wonderful inven - tions that have to do with Martians and lunar expe - ditions , and air-ships and comets , and fantastic biological imaginings .

		These works are romantic enough -LRB- in the sense of the romance of science -RRB- , and they appear all the more so when contrasted with the smaller group , which makes us acquainted with Mr.
Lewisham	PERSON	and
Kipps	PERSON	, and the haughty
Ann Veronica	PERSON	, and the hero of '' Tono-Bungay , '' and the Mr. u Elfrid '' Polly who now claims our attention .

		When Mr.
Wells	PERSON	comes down to the plane of ordi - nary mortality , he seems to feel it his stern duty to depict for us types of depressing meanness and blatant vulgarity .

		No Bohemian of the Latin Quarter was ever quite so hard on the bourgeoisie as Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is by habit and malice prepense .

		We presume this is a manifestation of the doctrinaire element in his writing , and that he thinks his socialist propaganda best served by filling us with contempt for man as he is actually shaped by the existing social pressure .

		Mr.
Polly	PERSON	is perhaps the meanest of all his creations .

		A draper 's assistant at first , then a small shopkeeper on his own account , married to a slattern , he becomes so disgusted with life that he attempts to escape from it by a combi - nation of arson with suicide .

		The latter does not come off , because his nerve fails him -LRB- he is going to do it with a razor -RRB- ; but the shop is burned up , and the insurance money collected from an unsuspecting company .

		He then deserts his wife ; and the rest of his story -LRB- as far as it is told us -RRB- is an Odyssey of vagabondage followed by an Iliad of warfare for the occupancy of a humble post as handy man in a rural tavern .

		All the figures in this tale are caric - atures , often highly amusing ones , but Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is so much attached to the mannerisms of his invention that he worries them to death .

		It is amusing for a time to guess at Mr.
Polly	PERSON	's meaning when he says '' rockcocky , '' and '' allitrition , '' and '' altaelation , '' but it proves wearying in the long run .

		The author 's humor is everywhere in evidence , and not all of it is of this low type ; but the smiles which it provokes are apt to be dreary .

		On the whole , we find less entertainment in this book than in the astronomical and biological fantasies .

		394 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	is a man of surprises .

		Each new book that he gives us is the exhibition of a new man - ner , and his accomplishment comprises the real or the romantic , the sordid or the ideal , the comic or the tragic , about as he pleases .

		His latest venture , called '' ` Fortune , '' is a study in the archaic picaresque , being concerned with the Spanish adventures of Sir
Richard Pendragon	PERSON	, a valiant braggart whom we at first barely tolerate , but at last come to admire and almost to love .

		He suggests at times
Don Quixote	PERSON	,
Falstaff	LOCATION	, Captain Fracasse ,
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	, and Za - globa ; and the setting-forth of his exploits is after the fashion of Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	as exemplified in ''
Richard Yea-and-Nay	PERSON	. ''

		The scene of this romance is the
Spain	LOCATION	of several centuries ago -- a period not too exactly defined -- and the interest increases steadily in joyousness from beginning to end .

		Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	, in his ''
Thurston	PERSON	of
Orchard Valley	ORGANIZATION	, '' gives us another novel constructed in accord - ance with his familiar formula .

		An Englishman , more or less unfortunate or handicapped at home , goes to the new world to build up his fortune .

		His goal is
British Columbia	LOCATION	; and there he engages upon a struggle for the conquest of nature which arouses all his latent energies .

		His beginnings are of the humblest , and he encounters obstacles that would break a less determined spirit , but he overcomes them with undaunted energy .

		A heroine appears at the proper juncture , to provide him with inspiration .

		She is far above him socially , and has to struggle long and strenuously with her inherited ideals before she can admit , even to herself , that simple strength and sincerity of character outweigh all the external attributes of a man .

		In the end , of course , she yields sweetly and wholly , in the hour of her lover 's dra - matic triumph over the hostility of nature and the villainy of man .

		Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	has told this story a dozen times before , but each time with an interest that makes it seem almost fresh .

		We should say that he has never told it more effectively than in this latest book , which is distinguished for fertility of invention and straightforward dramatic action .

		Thurston makes a very satisfactory hero , and his engineering exploits are difficult and daring enough to hold us fairly breathless .

		The author does not indulge in subtleties of analysis , and his characters are never deeply convincing in their psychology ; but he has a feeling for nature that he knows how to make contagious , and an instinct for the picturesque .

		If the company to which he introduces us is made up of lay figures , it is at least an interesting society , -- and it must not be forgotten that most of the people we meet in actual life are hardly more than lay figures in our consciousness .

		When we read Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's '' Lady Merton , Colonist , '' we almost suspect that she has taken a lesson from Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	; for she has given us essentially the same pair of lovers that his books acquaint us with , provides them with the same back - ground in the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and writes with the same glowing enthusiasm of man 's struggle with nature on that outpost of civilization .

		That she has bettered the instruction in some respects , goes without saying , for her style always has something of the quality of distinction , and she sees deeper into characters than the facile psychology of Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	.

		Lady
Merton	PERSON	is an aristocrat to the finger - tips , and
George Anderson	PERSON	-- the self-made and self - reliant colonial -- is somewhat handicapped by being the son of a drunken reprobate ; but love finds a way -- or , rather , Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	finds a way for it -- and the outcome is all that could be desired by the most sentimental of young women readers .

		The author has evidently been a good deal impressed by her Canadian journeyings , and it is also evident that the
C. P. R.	PERSON	has seen to it that she should be im - pressed in the proper way ; her voice rises at times to a positive paean in praise of the new country , its possibilities and its enchantments .

		There has been nothing like it since Charles
Eliot Norton	PERSON	came to
Chicago	LOCATION	, was personally-conducted to its sights , and proclaimed his discoveries to the world .

		It must be confessed that the literary fruits of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's American travels are not exactly what we should have expected .

		The present example is almost as curious as its predecessor , which was heralded as a study of life in the
United States	LOCATION	, and turned out to be a tract on the divorce problem , with a Spanish - Irish lady for a heroine .

		We can not say that either of the books has added materially to the author 's reputation .

		It is evident that the colonial note is destined to be heard with increasing insistence in the chorus of British fiction .

		The self-consciousness and the senti - ment of local patriotism that are so rapidly develop - ing in the far-off lands that owe allegiance to the British crown are rapidly making their way into lit - erature , and are bringing with them a new coloring and a new imagery .

		This is all to the good ; and the freshness of the new portrayals goes far to atone for what crudity they still exhibit .

		We may fitly link upon this occasion Miss
Cynthia Stockley	PERSON	's `` Poppy , '' a romance of
South Africa	LOCATION	, with Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's Canadian venture .

		Since Miss
Schreiner	PERSON	first took us by storm , we have had nothing from
South Africa	LOCATION	more impressive than this vivid and glowing romance of an Irish waif blossoming into opulent womanhood under the skies of
Natal	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story is immensely complicated , and will not bear summarizing ; but it all centres about the heroine , who sinned and was not defiled , and for whose pure and passionate nature '' a peace out of pain '' was finally wrought by the mysterious agencies of des - tiny .

		So vital a creation is not often met with in the pages of fiction , and even the book of life does not frequently reveal a woman whose emotions are raised to so high a power .

		This superb central study is combined with many others , sharply-limned but kept in proper subordination , and with various pictur - esque and dramatic accessories which contribute to the total impressive effect .

		The book lacks some - thing in coherence and lucidity , but of its remarkable power there can be only one opinion .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 ''
Nathan Burke	PERSON	, '' by Miss
Mary S. Watts	PERSON	, is one of those novels which aim to give a cross-section of American life as it appears to the sympathetic observer in some carefully-chosen place and period .

		It is much the same sort of book as Mr.
White	PERSON	's `` A Certain Rich Man '' -- equally generous in dimensions and equally overloaded with details -- but havingtheOhioof the forties for its scene , instead of the
Kansas	LOCATION	of a later half-century .

		It is also a book that reveals a great deal of minute historical knowledge and a remarkable power of characteriza - tion , besides being informed with a very wholesome idealism .

		Its hero is the
Nathan Burke	PERSON	of the title , a backwoods youth when we first know him , then a resident of
Columbus	LOCATION	, where he passes through the stages of chore-boy .

		grocery-store clerk , and fledg - ling attorney ; then a volunteer soldier in the Mexi - can War ; and finally a battle-scarred veteran of about thirty returning to civil life .

		His story is unfolded in the most leisurely way , and he tells it himself from the vantage-point of his later years , although the narrative is mostly given in the third person .

		When he drops into the first person , as is now and then the case , the effect is a little confus - ing , for we are apt to fancy that the author is speaking on her own account upon these occasions .

		While the book is essentially a work of fiction , a great deal of actual history is imbedded within it , and many adroit touches are added for the purpose of making it seem like a real autobiography .

		The Mexican War scenes take up nearly half the book , and give us an intimate view of that inglorious episode in our history .

		Otherwise , the story is his - torical only in its faithful reproduction of the con - ditions of life in those early Western days -- the social customs , the forms of speech , and the phases of political opinion .

		The characters offer a great variety of types , are sharply individualized , and are presented with a sympathy which embraces even the most despicable among them .

		It is life itself that the author gives us , rather than the artificial arrangements of life found in most novels ; her peo - ple are real people rather than the studies of virtue and villainy that we usually get .

		and that are so much easier to make .

		The story is doubtless too long-winded at times , but it is so human that we can not complain seriously of its length .

		It is cer - tainly a remarkable product of the sympathetic imagination , and one of the surprises of the season , coming , as it does , from a writer hitherto almost unknown .

		The novels of Miss
Mary Imlay Taylor	PERSON	always suffice for entertainment , and exhibit a constantly increasing skill in their construction .

		They give us familiar situations worked out upon familiar lines , and never worry us with problems or perplex us with casuistry .

		The familiar story told us in H Caleb Trench '' is that of the man of the people who from humble beginnings makes his way to the esteem of the community in which his lot is cast , and to the heart of the young woman who is des - tined for him , but whose wealth and social position seem to set her too far apart for hope .

		We know , of course , that the chasm will be bridged , and that the haughty maiden 's pride will be subdued ; we know also that the man will reach his goal by deeds of prowess , and will suffer discouragements that would break the resolution of almost any man not the hero of such a romance .

		The scene of these sentimental operations is a town in the
South	LOCATION	, some - where near the
Mississippi	LOCATION	; and the plot makes a judicious mingling of political with private interests .

		The rival aspirant for the heroine 's hand is clearly marked for defeat in the eyes of the practised reader , and the sum of villainies piled up against him is very satisfying .

		Seducer , embezzler , and murderer , he betakes himself to other scenes when the revelation is imminent , and
Caleb	PERSON	, to whose charge most of the offences have been laid , eomes in on the home-stretch without a rival in sight .

		Inci dentally , he wins in the political game also , and sees a Republican governor elected in a hidebound Democratic Commonwealth .

		We should call this the best story that
Miss Taylor	PERSON	has thus far produced .

		Neither the romance of American history nor the network of American parochial politics is given us in
Winston Churchill	LOCATION	's latest novel , but instead a study of the restless luxury-loving young woman of these later days , who drains the cup of pleasure until she makes the natural discovery that there are dregs at the bottom .

		The novel is called '' A Modern Chronicle , '' and its heroine might quite properly be classified with the collection made for our edification in Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's '' Together , '' while her environment is perhaps rather more suggestive of that which Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is wont to provide for those of his readers to whom the ways of '' society '' are always an object of alluring and envious inter est. .


Honora Leffingwell	PERSON	begins her life in
Europe	LOCATION	, although of American parentage ; but she is orphaned when hardly beyond infancy , and transported to
St. Louis	LOCATION	, where she finds a home with Uncle Tom and
Aunt Mary	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a simple and charming home , sweetened by all the elements that enter into true human happiness ; but
Honora	PERSON	has inherited worldly instincts , and she has glimpses of glittering things just beyond her reach that seem to her infinitely desirable .

		When she visits some wealthy friends in their
summer	DATE	home on the Hudson , she becomes so enamoured of luxurious living that she accepts , almost without reflection , the proposal of marriage made her by a commonplace stock-broker .

		His self-confident manner and general air of prosperity win him an easy victory , upon which follow the years of inevitable disillusionment .

		When Honora at last reaches the breaking-point , she obtains a divorce , and throws herself into the arms of a mas - terful
Rochester	LOCATION	sort of man , who takes her to his
Virginia	LOCATION	plantation to live .

		But his conservative family and neighbors have old-fashioned ideas of morality , and the couple find themselves practically ostracized .

		The husband thereupon develops a violent temper , and , one day seeking to work it off , is thrown from a vicious horse and instantly killed .

		396 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, More dark years then follow for
Honora	PERSON	, until , a chastened and ennobled woman , she accepts the devotion of Peter -- simple , homely , faithful Peter -- the childhood friend whose love has never failed her , and whom , had she possessed any discernment of character , she would have married in the begin - ning .

		The story is indeed '' a modern chronicle , '' paralleled by countless examples in our age and country .

		Such women as
Honora	PERSON	have a great deal to say about the individual 's right to happiness , and do not understand , until taught by stern experience , that the only right recognized by the order of nature is the right to suffer the full consequences of impa - tient folly and a false perspective of the value of life .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's heroine learns the lesson very thoroughly , and we leave her at the close with the belief that she will really profit by it .

		We think also that the author has shown himself fairly free from the fault of most novelists who deal with similar types and situations .

		He does not , in other words , permit judgment to become dissolved in sen - timent , nor does he coerce his readers into a sym - pathy , which makes the heroine appear to be more sinned against than sinning , more a victim of cir - cumstances than of her own unregulated will .

		For the rest , Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	seems to have acquired a closer hold upon life than his romantic excursions have heretofore evidenced , and he has also improved in his literary technique , although his style is still far from achieving anything like distinction . ''

		Predestined , '' which is described as '' a novel of
New York	LOCATION	Life , '' is the work of Mr.
Stephen French Whitman	PERSON	, a writer whose name we have not before seen upon a title-page .

		If it is a first novel , it is a surprisingly good one , -- a portrayal of char - acter both vivid and penetrating , a study in realism shot through with poetic glints .

		Its hero is ironically named
Felix	PERSON	, and his predestination is to become entangled with one woman after another , and with each new affair to sink lower in the scale of degrad - ation , becoming in the end a hopeless derelict .

		He is endowed with most of the graces and some of the virtues ; but a fatal weakness preys like a canker upon the core of his being .

		In early manhood , he learns with a shock that the fortune he had supposed would come to him has disappeared , and that he must gain a livelihood by his own efforts .

		He wins the love of a beautiful and noble-hearted girl , who might have saved him from himself , but speedily forfeits her respect and his own happiness by a liaison with the wife of one of his friends .

		His next affair is with a '' chorus lady '' of mercenary instincts , who throws him over when she discovers that his castles are all in
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Then he is attracted by a faded and plaintive creature who has been abandoned by her husband .

		This time he actually marries , and drags out a miserable existence in her company until her death sets him free .

		There is not much more to relate ; his progress to the gutter is now rapidly accelerated , and he dies a suicide .

		In outline , it is a gloomy enough story ; but in detail it seems less sombre , because the gloom is relieved by much cheerful incident , and by the sense of a life which is at least intensely lived , if with no high ultimate purpose in view .

		The hero 's occupation -LRB- he is a journalist -RRB- gives a kaleidoscopic pattern to his career , and the promptings of his better nature keep him in close contact with our sympathies , despite the lamentable lack of self-restraint which is his undoing .

		We instinctively murmur , '' Oh , the pity of it ! ''

		when we come to the closing pages of this ill-starred record .


California	LOCATION	in the fifties -- in the period when crime was rife , when the arm of the law seemed paralyzed , and when well-meaning citizens thought they were doing civilization a service by organized lawlessness -- is the scene of '' A Vigilante Girl , '' by Mr.
Jerome Hart	PERSON	.

		The veteran editor knows his subject thoroughly , and exhibits a fair degree of accomplishment as a novelist , although it is only proper to say that his tale is more important in its instructive than in its constructive aspect .

		As a piece of fictive art , it is rather mechanical and dis - jointed ; but as a detailed reproduction of the
life of a half century ago	DATE	on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast -- the wild politics and the wild money-getting , the unbridled corruption and the untamed passion -- it is vigorous and effective .

		We must say that the hero does not stir us to any very warm sympathy , but the heroine is quite satisfactory .

		She is called '' a vigilante girl '' because she at first defends the vigilante methods ; but she learns in the course of time to recognize in them a menace quite equal to that of the crime which they were designed to combat .

		This seems to be essentially the attitude of the author , and we can not doubt that it is justified by a dispassionate historical survey of the whole unique situation . ''

		The Isle of Whispers , '' wherewith Mr.
E. Law	PERSON	- rence
Dudley	PERSON	's ingenious romance is concerned , seems to be only a few miles out of
Boston	LOCATION	, but it is the headquarters of a gang of pirates whose methods are both original and entertaining .

		A young
New York	LOCATION	stockbroker is the hero , and his yacht is wrecked upon the island in the first chapter .

		The rascally inhabitants are ruled over by an aged reprobate who has a beautiful daughter .

		The new arrival falls in love with the girl -LRB- who is surprisingly innocent of the nefarious character of her father 's enterprises -RRB- , and accepts in pretended good faith the offer of a partnership in the pirate business .

		But he contrives to get word to the authorities , who make a descent upon the island , and obtain possession after a bloody scrimmage .

		The old man is killed , while the hero and heroine escape together , and land in
New Bedford	LOCATION	.

		It all makes a capital yarn , quite as plausible as we have any right to expect , and the excitement is not allowed to flag for a moment .

		The romantic novelist , casting about for a plot , may easily do worse than find one in the history of the revolutionary momement in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Hardly any other available field offers such attractive possi - bilities for melodramatic effects , and a reasonably fresh story is almost always to be found in that quarter .

		We have read at least a hundred such
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 397 stories , and yet confess that `` The Red Symbol , '' by Mr.
John Ironside	PERSON	, proves vastly entertaining .

		It is based upon the happenings of the past five years , which serve to make it really fresh in the literal sense .

		The hero is a dashing American , and the heroine is -- twins .

		These sisters are so much alike that the hero , although otherwise a person of much perspicacity , can not tell them apart , and thus we are enabled in one chapter to mourn over the tragic death of the heroine , and in the next to make the pleasing discovery that she is alive and safe .

		The plot all hangs upon a mysterious secret organization , and has the usual concomitants of the chosen symbol , the midnight assassination , the tribunal which judges traitors , the accomplished spy .

		the gallant rescue , and all the rest .

		The romance of the air is clearly destined to rival the romance of the sea as a motive for the story of adventure .

		Among the pioneer uses that have already been made of it , '' The Sky-Man , '' by Mr.
Henry Kitchell Webster	PERSON	, is easily the most success - ful .

		So thrilling a tale , indeed , and one so good for boys of all ages , has not recently come within our reach .

		The hero , erstwhile an American officer in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, has been falsely charged with unbecoming conduct , has left the service in disgust , made himself an exile from civilization , and devoted himself so successfully to the art of flying that when the story opens he is disporting himself in the Arctic solitude , a true monarch of the kingdom of the air .

		He is cumbered with neither aeroplane nor dirigible , but simply straps on his wings -LRB- measuring a hun - dred feet from tip to tip -RRB- , and makes something like a hundred miles an hour at his own sweet will .

		One day he becomes mixed up in a complicated situation in the northern wilds .

		The complication has three elements : the remnants of a polar expedition long given up for lost , a piratical crew , rescued by the survivors and afterwards treacherously turning against them , and a yachting company sent out in search of the lost explorers .

		In this latter party is the daughter of the lost leader of the original expe - dition , and thus a heroine is provided for our sky - man hero .

		These two are marooned for the winter on an ice-bound coast , and near them lurks all the while the pirate chief , seeking for an opportunity to destroy them , but for a time awed into inaction by his superstitious terror of the huge bird-like crea - ture that he occasionally sees hovering in the air .

		`` When he discovers that this aerial monster is only a man with wings , he forces matters to a speedy conclusion , and is killed after a desperate struggle .

		Nothing now remains to be done but to provide a second rescue expedition for the two young people -LRB- now avowed lovers -RRB- , and we leave them upon their return to civilization , having brought back with them a ship-load of gold .

		Every sort of romantic satis - faction is thus provided , and in liberal measure , by Mr.
Webster	PERSON	, who has the merit of knowing how to write in addition to that of possessing an unusual fund of knowledge and inventive ingenuity .

		■ f At a time when
South Africa	LOCATION	has a fisherman in served so conspicuously as a field for western water * .

		fa e hunter , the photographer , and the adventure-seeker , a book devoted to sport and travel in our own country comes as a novelty .

		Pro- fessor
C. F. Holder	ORGANIZATION	's • ' Recreations of a Sportsman on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a welcome diver - sion in a home field .

		The author has fished in the deep seas of the
Pacific	LOCATION	and in the streams of the high
Sierras	LOCATION	and
Cascades	LOCATION	-- has trailed swordfish in the waters off
San Clemente Island	LOCATION	in
Southern California	LOCATION	and moonfish off the
Channel Islands	ORGANIZATION	near
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	, has '' killed '' salmon in the bay of
Monterey	LOCATION	and trout in the mountain streams of the whole
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , has '' angled '' in the crater of
Mount Mazama	LOCATION	and chased whale with a revolver .

		On many of his expeditions he has been accompanied by other noted sportsmen , among them Mr.
Gifford Pinchot	PERSON	and Mr.
Stewart Edward White	PERSON	.

		The frontispiece shows Mr.
Pinchot	PERSON	and Mr.
White	PERSON	trolling for swordfish in
San Clemente Channel	LOCATION	, an exciting account of which adventure is given by the author , who , in a small launch on a dead black night , aided Mr.
Pinchot	PERSON	in his struggle with a swordfish weighing a hundred and eighty pounds .

		We quote a stirring passage : '' The work cut out for
Pinchot	PERSON	sitting in a skiff going at five miles an hour ; stern first , against a sea , in the dark , was to reel in a fish fighting mad or crazed by fear , that was anything from ten to twelve feet long ... Now I could see him dimly bracing to it , pumping with all his strength , gaining a foot to lose two , literally hauling the skiff up over the flying swordfish , and standing all the strain on the tip of his rod and his arms .

		That it was a good and hard fight , only those really know who have tried swordfish or tuna .

		The fish never rests ; he fights until he is dead , until the end .

		When you rest , he rests twice as fast , and to rest is to lose ... Suddenly I heard a shout of elation from
Pinchot	PERSON	. '

		We 've got him alongside . '

		The wind was blowing a high sea and tossing us about .

		Before I knew it I saw
Joe	PERSON	-LSB- the Mexican in the skiff with
Pinchot	PERSON	-RSB- directly underneath us , and I nearly lifted that coughing , hiccoughing eight-horse - power engine out of the launch trying to back her away .

		But it was too late ; a big sea tossed me over , and they seemed to suddenly come at me out of the
night	TIME	.

		I did not hit the skiff , but I disconcerted
Joe	PERSON	, who thought I was aboard of them , and he yelled , ' I 've lost him ! '

		The gaff had slipped , or he had lost his hold , and there was a s ma s hing , rolling , surging , and bounding , choice talk in Spanish .

		Then came
Pinchot	PERSON	's voice , ' I 've got him by the tail ! '

		And so he had .

		He held the floundering swinging fish with grim desperation until
Joe	PERSON	got a fresh hold , and a rope about him , and , as
Pinchot	PERSON	told me later , he determined to ' hang to his fish if he went overboard . ' ''

		Besides being the most enthusiastic of sportsmen , Mr.
Holder	PERSON	is a thorough man of science ; and thus the account of his recreations has a double interest .

		His attitude , too , is that of the born angler -- that angling should be approached as an art , and results considered as incidents .

		Like the immortal Wal - ton , who `` went fishing that he might commune with all the beautiful things of life and nature , sometimes forgetting his angling for echoes , the songs of birds and milkmaids , '' Mr.
Holder	PERSON	finds interest in the quieter aspects of the game , and 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, devotes pages to descriptions of some of the most picturesque portions of the western coast .

		The illustrations are from photographs taken by the author and his friends , and are a decided addition .

		hook on our table .

		Messrs.
Cooper	PERSON	and
Westell	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	are the authors , Mr.
Newall	PERSON	is the artist , and
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		The work is in two rather sumptuous looking quarto volumes , with sixteen full-page col - ored plates , and seventy of the same dimensions in black and white , from Mr.
Newall	PERSON	's drawings .

		The reader thinks at once of
Sargent	ORGANIZATION	's monumental `` Silva , '' with its half-thousand species and hundreds of lithographic plates ; but with such a work the present volumes do not at all invite comparison .

		Sargent 's is a descriptive history , telling all that is known concerning each arboreal species ; the present work is more in the style of a handbook designed for practical men and intended to be of every-day use to the lover of trees in the '' green-walled garden . ''

		The opening sentence tells us that the work has been prepared to enable the reader to identify the trees of the British Isles , and to present much valuable information on such subjects as insects and fungoid pests , the more common galls , etc. .

		Such a book , it would seem , should be offered in one volume , bound in oil-cloth or some similar fashion , that it might be of omnipresent service : we fear the smear of the gardener 's thumb or the touch of rain-drops on these handsome covers .

		About half of the first volume is devoted to what may be esteemed '' valuable inform - ation . ''

		This part of the work consists of a glossary , a list of M Latin roots '' and Greek '' root-words , '' a calendar to show the date of flowering for the listed species , an introduction full of '' a number of things , '' and four chapters on insects , galls , and fungoid pests .

		The glossary descends to great detail of erudition , giving even the
Saxon	PERSON	origin of English words ; '' acuminate '' is cited among Latin roots , '' latex '' is derived from lac , and '' paraphysis '' from para and phyllon , etc. .

		The chapters on plant-maladies and their remedies will be found serviceable ; it may be noted in passing , however , that the Amer - ican gardener who would attempt to follow English prescription here must use kerosene where paraffin is cited .

		The descriptive pages follow the order of the older books , beginning with the crowfoots .

		There is no objection to this , but the text should be covered by some sort of a key that would enable the less ex - pert reader to name an unknown species or to find the description of familiar forms .

		As the matter stands , your ordinary gardener or reader can refer to a description only as he knows the name of what he seeks .

		The illustrations are generally excellent .

		The colored plates are three-color half-tones .

		The plates from drawings are striking in effect ; they remind one of the old wood-cuts that made intelli - gible the lore of the herbalist and the botanies of long ago .

		In fine , these volumes , although primarily for English use , are of interest also in these western fields .

		Fully a fifth of the species described are North American plants ; and it will interest every lover of trees and every friend of out-door art to see to what extent the wild beauty of this newer world has been transplanted in its freshness to adorn and beau - tify still further the loveliest gardens of the world .

		Tending trees In Mr.
B. E. Fernow	PERSON	's volume on a ^ KHL * , `` The Care of Trees '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- we may find lessons in a very practical sort of tree conservation .

		Here we are taught the care of individual trees , how to look out for our pets , the special favorites of park and street-side and lawn .

		We are told how to plant trees , how they must be trimmed and tended if they are to realize our higher sense of symmetry and dendritic beauty .

		Full in - formation is given relative to soils , tools , fertilizers , and repairs that go on either naturally or artificially ; for in these days there is '' an art which does mend nature , '' an art which in this case is not nature , -- `` tree surgery '' the gardeners name it , -- an art by which to the '' brotherhood of venerable trees '' new life is given .

		One thing it seems the author here for - gets to urge : all our care and skill avail not unless we first select a proper tree .

		Trees of the same kind differ in habit , and for happiest ultimate attainment must be carefully selected .

		Half the present volume is given thus to arboriculture ; the remainder is a descriptive and well illustrated list of species suit - able for planting , with their advantages and disad - vantages in particular locations .

		The list of both trees and shrubs includes those suitable for every section of the eastern side of the continent .

		Many species are cited as '' half-hardy '' or '' half-hardy as far as
Ottawa	LOCATION	. ''

		A half-hardy species is sooner or later wholly disappointing , and may as well be at once stricken from the category .

		A list of trees and shrubs perfectly hardy as far north as
Ottawa	LOCATION	or
Chicago	LOCATION	-- and there is possibly such a list -- might be brief , but would be extremely useful .

		The book is a convenient and valuable addition to our litera - ture concerning trees .

		It is more to be commended for matter than for manner .

		Our author speaks for himself on this point : `` This book is not a sentimental effusion on the beauty and need of trees , but a com - pilation of information such as the owner of trees may be in search of . ''

		THE DIAL purposes .

		The work deals with the structure , life history , and habits of the important shellfish used as food , and gives a rather full account of the oyster fields on the American coasts and of the methods of culture , capture , and marketing , in vogue both here and in
Europe	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		The enemies of the oyster and means of combating them are discussed , and the relation which uncooked oysters and clams bear to the spread of typhoid fever is plainly set forth .

		The book also contains a number of original observations on the structure , physiology , and natural history of the oyster and clam , here published for the first time .

		The book is essentially an American work , and deals only with the principal edible mollusks of the
East	LOCATION	- ern
Coast	ORGANIZATION	.

		The great part which the parcels post plays in the distribution of the enormous product of the French oyster-beds throughout
Europe	LOCATION	might well have been mentioned .

		One looks in vain for mention of periwinkles , abalone , or the delicious octopus of
Naples	LOCATION	which can at least claim relation - ship to the shellfish .

		Our great fresh-water clam-shell industries , the pearl fisheries and mother-of-pearl industries , are scarcely noted in the book .

		As with other natural resources of our bountiful country , we have wasted and exterminated our food supplies of our coasts , raked our oyster and clam beds bare , and , worst of all , we have ruthlessly fouled their waters with industrial wastes and sewage of our great cities .

		Fortunately , there are great stretches of coast , espe - cially in the south , well suited for the development of oyster culture under scientific methods , both profit - able and productive of a cheap and abundant food supply .

		To plant and reap and distribute this har - vest of the sea is the problem of the future .

		Nevertheless the book is dedicated to the pious memory of the Leipsic guide-book publisher , and is bound in the familiar

		But the

		The author , a German-born American , has those impartially divided sympathies that fit one for depicting the peculiarities of one nation in a manner that shall amuse the readers of another while giving offense to neither .

		The positiveness of omniscient youth gives to his utterances no uncertain ring , and his short snappy sentences are an excellent antidote to summer drowsiness .

		Some of the questions which he takes up jauntily and settles conclusively in a few pages have to do with the morals of
Europe	LOCATION	, the character of the German Emperor , the intel - lectual drama ,
Gambrinus	ORGANIZATION	and Bacchus , inspired bureaucracy , and the philosophy of militarism .

		Youth and impressionability disport themselves in Mr.

L. H. #	PERSON
# # # #	MONEY	* !

		B ^ ' entiUed '' The Mature-Study Idea '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , brings us the latest word on this important topic .

		The idea of nature-study should be simple enough , one might think ; it ought to be plainly the study of Nature -- the natural world .

		But the hyphenated title here stands for something different -- something that would describe an educational effort of some years standing , designed to interest children and youth in Nature and her ways , all apart from the more formal presentments of science .

		The effort is really an outcome of the kindergarten movement , and was at first , and is yet in some places , the application of kindergarten methods to the investigation of more familiar natural objects .

		The attempt was in some instances unfortunate .

		Some of the nature-study text-books are downright nonsense .

		The play-idea involved in the kindergarten system , when carried into the fine movement of natural things , is apt to 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, degenerate into myth and foolishness .

		Professor
Bailey	PERSON	would have us see the outside world just as it is , just as it lies before our unaided senses .

		His laboratory is the open field , and his nature-study is like that of
Gilbert White	PERSON	,
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and
Burroughs	LOCATION	.

		We are carried away , in these days , by revelations of the microscope , and are in danger of losing that fine sympathetic appreciation of out-door objects which must ever lie at the basis of all true nature - study , and of true science as well ; for nature-study , in the right sense , may not traverse science .

		Nature - study need not be systematic .

		It does not especially care for the relations of things , except as these are related to the observer and claim his appreciation and love .

		Science is formal and severe ; nature - study is natural and human , and should contribute directly to the interest and individual happiness of men .

		The present volume is really a revised edition of a valuable book published some years ago .

		Pro- fessor
Bailey	PERSON	is indefatigable , and we have here not only much new matter but a thorough revision of the former text .

		The pages are full of suggestions born of wide and wise experience , and deserve care - ful reading by teachers and nature-lovers generally .

		Its qualities make their appeal , of course , not to the bodily senses , but to the finer perceptions of the mind and the imagination .

		I will have a garden ! ''

Taft	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, the young English poet , has writ - ten an imaginative verse drama , '' The Forest of Wild Thyme , '' which Sir Herbert Tree is to produce in Lon - don and later in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is possible that Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	will visit this country at the time of its presen - tation here .

		1910 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 401 The Japanese artist
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, whose charming interpretations of
London	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	have attracted wide attention , has written an account of his interesting life , which
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish soon under the title , `` A Japanese Artist in
London	LOCATION	. ''

		It is announced that beginning with the
July	DATE	issue '' The Forum '' is to be published by Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, though it will continue to be owned by the
Forum Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	, of which Mr.
Isaac L. Rice	PERSON	has been the president since its for - mation twenty-four years ago .

		The
Academy of Pacific Coast History	ORGANIZATION	publishes in pamphlet form
Miguel Costanro	PERSON	's `` Narrative of the Portola Expedition of 1769-1770 , '' giving the text in both Spanish and in English translation .

		This publica - tion is edited by Messrs.
Adolph van Hewert-Engert	PERSON	and
Frederick J. Teggart	PERSON	, officers of the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Volume V. , Part 2 , of
Philip Schaff	PERSON	's '' History of the Christian Church '' carries the chronicle to what may fairly be called the close of the Middle Ages -- that is , to the beginning of the Protestant Reformation .

		This new volume of a monumental series is the work of Dr.
David S. Schaff	PERSON	, and is published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		Mr.
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	's '' Manual of Gardening , '' lately issued by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a combination and revision of the main parts of the same author 's well - known '' Garden-Making '' and '' Practical Garden - Book , '' together with much new material , the results of later experience .

		A better book in its field is not likely to appear for a long while .

		Mr.
Horace Kephart	PERSON	, author of an authoritative manual on `` Camping and Woodcraft , '' now issues through the Outing Publishing Company a little manual of '' Camp Cookery , '' in which the camper-out of what - ever degree of experience or proficiency is likely to find many useful suggestions toward the enhancement of his alimentary welfare while in the woods .

		A new book by Mr.
Ralph Waldo Trine	PERSON	, to be called `` The Land of Living Men , '' will be brought out by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the early Fall .

		This author 's books are having a very large circulation in
Germany	LOCATION	at the present time , and his '' In Tune with the Infinite '' is published in translation in eleven dif - ferent countries , while an edition in Esperanto is now being brought out in
London	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Harriet L. Keeler	PERSON	, the author of two excellent handbooks on American trees and shrubs , now publishes through the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	a popular study of '' Our Garden Flowers , '' describing in detail their native lands , their life histories , and their structural affiliations .

		A profusion of well-executed illustrations in half-tone and line add to the usefulness of a volume which must be considered practically indispensable to the amateur gardener .

		Mr. W illiam
Swan Sonnenschein	ORGANIZATION	's valuable reference work , '' The Best Books , '' is soon to be issued in a new and revised edition by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		All the matter in the old editions that remains of value has been retained ; the characterizations have in many cases been changed , and much added , bringing the record of literature down to the end of
1909	DATE	.

		The whole contents of the book will probably cover more than 100,000 titles .

		Under the editorship of Professor
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	of
the University of Wisconsin , Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish a series of volumes intended to consider the several aspects of mental life of largest theoretical and practical interest , and to survey the ethical , social , and aesthetic aspects of human nature in relation to their origin , development , and influence .

		The books will be simple in treatment and will have a direct appeal to the general reader .

		Among the titles in preparation are '' Psychology in Common Life , '' '' Character and Tem - perament , '' and '' The Health of the Mind . ''

		A bathchairman with a leaning toward literature is the unique discovery recently made by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		Under his encouragement ,
George Meek	PERSON	, who for nine - teen years has pushed and pulled a bath chair up and down the Parade at
Eastbourne	LOCATION	, has written an autobio - graphy whose naked simplicity and unaffected realism has attracted marked interest among the
London	LOCATION	review - ers .

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish the book in this country .

		A blend of
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	,
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	,
John Ruskin	PERSON	, and his own refreshing and underived self , appears in that finely conceived character , already familiar to readers of Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	's '' Open Country , '' --
John Maxwell Senhouse	PERSON	, whose '' Letters to Sanchia '' are now published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	in a small volume extracted from '' that true tale '' above - mentioned .

		To have created such a character as Sen - house is to have lived and labored not in vain , and Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	has done his readers a favor by issuing this separate collection of his original utterances .

		Announcements of English fiction for the coming Fall season include , among others , the following titles : '' The Creators '' by Miss
May Sinclair	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Ingle	PERSON	- side '' by Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, '' Clayhanger '' by Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, '' All the World Wondered '' by Mr.
Leonard Merrick	PERSON	, `` Lady Good-for-Nothing '' by Mr.
A. T. Quiller Couch	PERSON	, `` Panther 's Cub '' by Mr. and Mrs.
Castle	PERSON	, '' Rest Harrow '' by Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, '' An Affair of Dishonour `` by Mr.
William de Morgan	PERSON	, `` Second String '' by Mr.
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, ''
Daisy	ORGANIZATION	's Aunt '' by Mr.
E. F. Benson	PERSON	, and '' The Golden Silence '' by Mr. and Mrs.
Williamson	PERSON	.

		It is safe to say that all these books will be published in this country also .

		The first number of '' The Romanic Review '' has made its appearance from the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A quarterly journal devoted to research ... in the field of the early Romance languages and litera - ture , '' the new review proposes for itself a definitely limited field ; and within the limits set , its work bids fair to be scholarly and valuable .

		One may object to the choice of '' Romanic '' instead of '' Romance '' in the title ; but , barbaric as it is , the Germanism is of course better fitted to indicate the philological character of the new periodical .

		H the promise of the table of contents is carried out as a definite policy , as would seem likely from a consideration of the choice of editors , we can only lament that the university attitude toward the Romance literatures is developing the same tenden - cies which have so largely helped to drive out Greek and Latin from our undergraduate curricula .

		Why should the cry of '' dilettanteism '' drive our scholars away from purely literary studies ?

		Why should we consider
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	or Balzac less worthy of scholarly study than
Raoul de Cambrai	ORGANIZATION	or the provenance of some forgotten
Chanson de Geste f However	ORGANIZATION	, this perhaps is a minor objection .

		Romance scholarship in
America	LOCATION	has always been a bit self-conscious , and it is eminently fitting that it should become conscious of itself in a special review .

		434 THE NEW THEATRE .

		With much that is discouraging in the con - dition of the American stage at the present day , it is possible to discover here and there a sign of promise indicative of better things to come , and even to chronicle now and then the actual accomplishment of something that is really worth doing in the theatrical field .

		Such a promise was held out to us when the New Theatre was projected in
New York	LOCATION	; and such an accomplishment has now become , with the close of the first season of that enterprise , a matter of recorded history .

		The enterprise had much to contend with in the way of suspicion , cynicism , and the scarcely - veiled antagonism of the interests that are well content with things theatrical as they are .

		It was scoffed at as a '' highbrow '' venture , and that label offers much opportunity for cheap derision .

		It was despaired of as something too good for the depraved pub - lic of this wicked world , and the analogy of certain earlier ventures in idealism seemed to deny it the hope of enduring success .

		It was decried from the seats of the mighty who take counsel together in the '' syndicate '' and who have substituted commercialism for art in nine - tenths of our playhouses .

		Nevertheless , it persevered in its quixotic undertaking , built and opened its playhouse , collected and trained its company , and has now shamed the tongues of incredulity and malice by a completed season of artistic effort that has surpassed the expecta - tions even of its friends .

		This first season has been to some extent experimental , and of necessity , for it had pio - neer work to do , and standards had to be created , or at least pieced together out of lapsed memories of the past and of suggestions from other coun - tries which take the stage seriously as one of the chief instrumentalities of culture .

		There were some mistakes , such as the building of too large an auditorium , the initial toying with stellar attractions , the ill-advised inclusion of operatic performances in its programme , and the occasional selection of an unworthy play .

		But these mistakes were not fatal , for they admitted of obvious remedies , and the manage - ment has been quick to realize them and to profit by the experience .

		On the other side of the 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, account , there is the solid achievement of a long season quite successful from the box-office stand - point , and highly satisfactory from the stand - point of observers who are mainly concerned with artistic and cultural aims .

		At the close of the
New York	LOCATION	season about a month ago , the Company set out on a mission - ary expedition to a few selected cities , the most important of them being
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It is too expensive an organization to expect to pay for itself upon such a tour , and the management made a generous appropriation to meet the deficit .

		In other words , it decided to give to a few favored cities an object-lesson in the sub - sidized theatre that has often been advocated , but that has seen small prospect of becoming realized in this country .

		The fortnight allotted to
Chicago	LOCATION	has falsified a good deal of pessimistic prophesying , and has opened many eyes to the fact that conscientious art is not the least among the attractions that may draw audiences into theatres .

		In brief , the eighteen performances given in
Chicago	LOCATION	have been presented in most cases to '' capacity '' houses , and great numbers of visitors have been turned from the doors for the simple reason that there were no more seats to sell .

		No other success equal to this has been achieved in
Chicago	LOCATION	during the past season , and it is pleasant to think that for once the most successful enterprise has been also the most meritorious .

		Seven plays were given an average of three performances each during the
Chicago	LOCATION	engage - ment .

		Of these plays , three were approved classics -- Shakespeare being represented by '' Twelfth Night '' and `` A
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' and
Sheridan	PERSON	by '' The School for Scandal . ''

		The two Shakespearian performances were made the occasion of an interesting contrast in method , since the former was given with the usual modern accessories , while the latter was given '' in the Elizabethan manner , '' which means without change of scene .

		There is something to be said for the archaic mode of representation , but we imagine that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	himself would have welcomed many of our modern appliances , and that the bareness of the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	performances was rather a matter of necessity than of set deter - mination .

		The ideal setting for a play of Shake - speare in our day is one that spares nothing likely to make the action intelligible , and per - mits nothing likely to distract attention from either the action or the thought .

		For the rest , it was a pleasure to witness a '' Twelfth Night '' which was something more than the exploitation of a Viola or a
Malvolio	ORGANIZATION	, `` A
Winter	DATE	's Tale '' which was something more than series of stage - pictures grouped about a Hermione .

		Likewise , it was a great satisfaction to witness a `` School for Scandal '' in which Lady
Teazle	PERSON	took her proper place and did not always read her lines from the centre of the stage .

		With this comedy , and with '' The Rivals , '' it is going to take us a long while to forget Ada Rehan and
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	; but it must be admitted that they put the works considerably out of balance .

		Of the modern plays included in the fort - night 's repertory , the triumph was scored by
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's '' Sister Beatrice . ''

		We have rarely seen upon the stage anything as lovely and as appealing .

		It was at once the embodi - ment of the most exquisite poetry and of the most delicate spirituality , besides delighting the eye with a color-scheme of enchanting beauty .

		In the production of such a work as this , a theatre becomes a temple , and a play-goer a worshipper .

		Since '' Sister Beatrice '' is a short piece , it had to be coupled with something else to fill out the
evening	TIME	; and its pendant was Mr.
Besier	PERSON	's '' Don , '' a comedy that is serious as well as amusing .

		The two remaining offerings of the engagement were '' Strife '' and '' The Nigger . ''

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' Strife '' is the work of a writer intensely in earnest , with an extraordinary power to make us feel the poignancy of suffering , and to arouse our social sympathies .

		Although its spirit is that of a sermon , it proved dramat - ically effective .

		Mr.
Sheldon	PERSON	's '' The Nigger '' is interesting as the work of a very young man , and is a thoroughly honest composition .

		• It comes a little too near to melodrama in its situa - tions , and its gloom is unrelieved .

		But it is a work of promise , and we anticipate with interest the play that this young writer is likely to give us when he shall have more suitable material to deal with .

		Such is the varied selection of plays by which
Chicago	LOCATION	has been permitted to judge of the
New Theatre	ORGANIZATION	and its significance .

		The judg - ment has been so favorable , and the support accorded so hearty , that the company will undoubtedly include this city in all its future plans .

		The season has brought home to us the lesson of what was lost when the stock company ceased to occupy an important position in our theatrical world , and has aroused in several thousands of people a determination to work for a restoration of the older and better order of things .

		It has been so much the most sat - isfactory of the year 's theatrical happenings that the '' star system '' and the '' long run ''
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 413 have been clearly shown to be comparatively indefensible .

		It has proved to us the immense advantage of measure and balance and good taste over emphasis and distortion and meretri - cious display .

		GOLD WIN SMITH .

		A ripe scholar , a sane and sagacious observer of the activities of men , and a wise counsellor upon the deeper problems of the political , social , and intel - lectual life , passed away in
Toronto	LOCATION	on the seventh of this month .


Goldwin Smith	PERSON	was eighty-six years of age , and for the nearly forty years of his resi - dence in the Dominion has been easily the most distinguished of Canadians .

		Coming to
America	LOCATION	for permanent residence at the age of forty-five , he brought with him a brilliant reputation as a student of history and political science .

		For eight years he had been Regius Professor of modern history at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and had published something like a dozen volumes .

		He had also identified himself with the group of liberal leaders , among whom Mill and Bright were numbered , who realized the underlying causes of our Civil War , and championed the Federal government in its struggle to preserve the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was in
1871	DATE	that he settled down in
Toronto	LOCATION	, soon after to be happily married , and to make `` The Grange '' a kind of Mecca for statesmen and scholars .

		Since then , more than a score of books have come from his pen , besides countless contribu - tions to periodical literature .

		Some of his books are of the sort that serve their purpose and no longer need to be read , but many of them are works of lasting value -- profound discussions of the philoso - phy of history , keen studies in literary criticism , and wise reflections upon the riddle of existence .


Goldwin Smith	PERSON	was , like Mill and
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, a convinced exponent of the supreme authority of rea - son in all intellectual concerns ; and the truth , even if it might seem chilling , was to him more desir - able than the comforting delusions with which many men are content . '

		- Individual freedom , national independence , and the reign of justice , universal peace , and the happiness of the masses of mankind , are the ends for which this publicist has consistently striven , with voice and pen alike , in
England	LOCATION	and on the American continent '' -- this is a summing - up by President
Schurman	PERSON	.

		It is impressive to think that the great Englishman now dead has lived under five sovereigns , and that he once '' talked with a man who talked to the man who was premier of
England	LOCATION	in
1801	DATE	-- to
Addington	LOCATION	about
Pitt	PERSON	. ''

		He remembered the Reform Bill , the destruction of threshing machines by an angry peasantry , the time when fires were lighted by tinder , when the curfew was heard , and when men were put in the stocks .

		His death has srtapped one of the few remaining links between that remote past and the twentieth century .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A BRILLIANT LITERARY BLUNDER has just made its appeal for immortality in the columns of a current newspaper , in connection with the celebration of the hundreth anniversary of
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's birth ,
May 23	DATE	.

		The reports of her death by shipwreck , sixty years ago , when nearing
New York	LOCATION	harbor , have always seemed harrowing , and it is a relief to hear that the accepted narrative is `` all a mistake '' -- that she is still alive , and well enough to join in the cele - bration of her own centennial , at her birthplace in
Cambridgeport	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		The newspaper referred to printed in its issue of
May 24	DATE	an article headed , '' Countess d'Ossoli is 100 years old . ''

		It read , in all seriousness , as follows : ''
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	, Countess d'Ossoli , observed the 100th anniversary of her birth yesterday at her home , 71 Cherry street ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Addresses were made by the Rev.
Woodman Brad	PERSON	- bury , Miss
Edith Fuller	PERSON	, and
Miss Megraw	ORGANIZATION	.

		Music was rendered by Miss
Harriet Wescott	PERSON	, Mrs.
A. H. Richards	PERSON	,
Miss Ella M. Chamberlain	PERSON	, and Miss
Sarah F. Rainlet	PERSON	.

		Miss Fuller was married many years ago to the
Marquis d'Ossoli	PERSON	of
Italy	LOCATION	, when she was working for Italian liberty .

		She was a fellow - pupil of
Holmes	PERSON	and
Richard Henry Dana	PERSON	, and a friend of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		She was the only woman promi - nently identified with the transcendental movement and the Brook Farm community .

		Hawthorne pic - tured her as
Zenobia	PERSON	in his ' Blithedale Romance . ' ''

		This charming story appeared , not in some `` raw country weekly '' in
Arkansas	LOCATION	or
Arizona	LOCATION	, but in a prominent morning journal of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		This fact might incite to comment ; but we give , instead , a quotation .

		It is from a well-known literary woman of that city . ''

		A few weeks ago , '' she writes , '' we had a literary pow-wow at our
Boston Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	, and pointed out our sad need in this country of the best criticism , and of journals voicing the same .

		And we gave thanks , in closing , for
Chicago	LOCATION	and The Dial . ''

		Chicago and The Dial !

		-- and liter - ary
Boston	LOCATION	giving thanks for these !

		How strange it seems , and new !

		The untimely end of ''
O. Henry	PERSON	, '' short-story writer and master of a mirth-provoking style that was as vigorous and untrammelled as an unbroken
Texas	LOCATION	steer , brings sincere regret to thousands of readers .


William Sidney Porter	PERSON	, as he was known outside the world of literature , was a native of
Greensboro	LOCATION	,
North Carolina	LOCATION	, where he was born in
1867	DATE	.

		Ranch life in
Texas	LOCATION	, journalism in
Houston	LOCATION	, banana-raising in
Central America	LOCATION	, and short story writing in
New Orleans	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, -- these were a few of the varied activities in which the rest - less young man engaged , finding his place at last in the pages of the popular monthlies , which were glad to pay him as much as
$ 750	MONEY	and
$ 1000	MONEY	apiece for his tales .

		Although he has written voluminously of Western life in exhilarating English redolent of the prairie and untraversed places , it is essentially in his portrayals of
New York	LOCATION	life that his fame most 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, securely rests .

		The field of the Tenderloin he made his own ; and his characterizations of its types -- the chorus girl '' artiste '' ; the shop-girl of the alluring pompadour ; the stenographer , i. e. , `` a picture-hat and a piece of pineapple chewing-gum '' ; the park - bench loafer with his fear of the '' cops '' and his regular place in the '' bread-row '' ; the Tammany boss of the big diamonds and the fat cigar ; the ''
John Doe	PERSON	'' who '' sits to have his shoes polished within sound of a bowling-alley , and bears some - where about him turquoises '' -- all these stand out in his gallery of portraits with never-to-be-forgotten vividness .

		While some of his later work has obvi - ously suffered in the interests of commercialism , yet at his best -- in the collections which comprise '' The Four Million , '' '' The Trimmed Lamp , '' and '' The Voice of the City '' -- he has been named , not unworthily , in the same breath with
Maupassant	PERSON	and Kipling as an artist in short-story writing .

		A SUPERFLUOUS FUNCTIONARY IN THE DRAMATIC world is a `` literary director , '' if we may judge by the experiences of the New Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	, as set forth by the discouraged functionary himself in the
June	DATE	number of '' The World 's Work . ''

		Out of three thousand MS. plays submitted to the New Theatre , only three seemed to him worth accepting .

		This showing is so little inspiring as to the future of play-writing in
America	LOCATION	that he appears to have thrown up his job in disgust : a not irrational pro- cedure , since there can be no pressing need of a '' literary director '' when there is nothing literary to direct .

		While one can hardly wonder at this reader 's pessimistic attitude regarding the output of our native playwrights , yet there might be other ways of accounting for what to him seems '' an unmitigated staggerer . ''

		In the view of the rejected playwrights , the trouble might be with the '' liter - ary director '' himself ; they might believe , in all sincerity , that he did not know a good play when he saw it .

		But that could hardly be regarded as an unbiassed judgment .

		A more reasonable explana - tion we suspect might be found in the number of old plays submitted -- the number of would-be dra - matists who furbished up their oft-rejected and dilap - idated manuscripts and offered them to the New Theatre whose vaunted feature of u endowment '' made it a shining mark for them .

		If theatres are to be endowed , why not playwrights as well ?

		And if subsidies are going round in the theatrical world , why should they not be shared by the children of gifts and grace who furnish the plays without which the theatre , New or Old , would be but empty walls ?

		`` Let us furnish the plays for the people , '' they might say , '' and we care not who pays the bills for their production . ''

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	at ninety-one is a most interesting and venerable figure .

		While her fame with pos - terity will rest largely on her '' Battle Hymn of the Republic '' -LRB- in spite of its author 's conscious and unconscious advocacy of universal peace and good - will -RRB- , her wide range of talents and sympathies will not be forgotten .

		As a graceful and winning plat - form speaker , able to address her audience , if need be , in other tongues than her own , and as the friend and promoter of many worthy causes , she has stamped the impress of her personality on her age and generation .

		As a late example of her still active participation in matters of public concern , it is interesting to note her appearance lately before a legislative committee to plead the cause of pure milk for
Boston	LOCATION	, where , as in many other places , the laws for protecting the community from the dangers of adulterated or diluted milk are much too laxly enforced .

		Fortunate indeed is
Boston	LOCATION	, the home of many noble women , to have in these days -- as it is to be hoped she will have for some years to come -- this one of the noblest of them all .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	is almost the same age as that other remark - able woman , '' the mother of women 's clubs '' in
America	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Caroline Severance	PERSON	, once of
Boston	LOCATION	, but now living in
Los Angeles	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, where , like Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, she is still actively interested in whatever concerns the welfare of the community or the nation .

		The centennial of the `` Learned Black - smith , '' as
Elihu Burritt	PERSON	was commonly called , has had its celebration some months in advance of his hundredth birthday , which falls on the eighth of next
December	DATE	.

May	DATE	, paid appropriate tribute to the memory of the man who conducted the first Ameri - can newspaper -LRB- `` The Christian Citizen '' -RRB- that devoted considerable space to the cause of universal peace , and who also originated the '' Olive Leaf Mission , '' a monthly issue of printed slips , headed by a dove with an olive leaf in its bill , that were sent out to hundreds of newspapers for insertion .

		Among the many other reforms claiming Burritt 's more or less active interest was the scheme of an ocean penny-postage to promote international corre - spondence , and so , indirectly , international peace .

		This was in
1847	DATE	, sixty-two years before the slow world showed itself ready for such a beneficent innovation .

		Anti-slavery , temperance , self-culture , and other good causes , were also advocated in '' The Christian Citizen , '' and the sufferings of

		The Citizen of the World , '' an anti-slavery journal , was a few years later taken charge of by him in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Besides editorial labors he wrote more than thirty books and pamphlets of a philanthropic or instruc - tive character , among which may be mentioned '' Sparks from the Anvil , '' '' Walks from
London	LOCATION	to Land 's End and Back , '' '' Peace Papers for the People , '' and '' Ten-Minute Talks on All Sorts of Subjects , with Autobiography . ''

		THE DIAL 415 sition , everyone has heard and read considerable .

		His Autobiography is the authoritative source of our information under that head .

		But like many men of great acquisitive powers and wonderful memory .

		Burritt possessed no great originality of thought , and his title to fame rests on his philan - thropic labors rather than on his wide learning and his mastery of many tongues .

		• • • Dr.
William Gordon-Stables	PERSON	, surgeon , trav - eller , and author , has written the last of his many popular books .

		Death claimed him last month , at the age of seventy years and a few days .

		His fer - tile brain and his well-stored memory of personal adventures in many lands and on many seas fur - nished him with material for a hundred and fifty volumes of vivid description and narrative and varied invention , many of his books being written for and well liked by boys .

		Born in
Banffshire	LOCATION	, he studied medicine at
Aberdeen University	ORGANIZATION	, and while still but a youth he shipped as surgeon on a small whaling brig bound for the Arctic regions .

		A false report of the loss of the vessel with all on board pre - ceded his home-coming , so that when he presented himself at his father 's door he was met by father and sister both dressed in deep mourning . '

		• `` Which of the family is dead ? ''

		he inquired anxious ` y. * • Why , you are , '' was the reply .

		Nine years of service in the navy then followed , and still another voyage to the frozen zone .

		Among his books a few of the best ^ known are '' From Pole to Pole , '' • • Every Inch a Sailor . '' ''

		A Girl from the States , '' '' The Rose of Allandale , '' ''
Frank Hardinge	PERSON	, '' `` Cycling for Health , '' and `` Tea : the
Drink of Pleasure	ORGANIZATION	and of Health . ''

		In '' Who 's Who '' it is recorded that his recreations were '' curling , swim - ming , caravan touring all
summer	DATE	, and music , '' and that he was a member of the
Humanitarian League	ORGANIZATION	and Wandering Secretary to the Sea Birds Pro- tection Society .

		In the caravan that formed his
summer	DATE	home many of his books were written .

		The dedication of the
Smith College Library	ORGANIZATION	, the fine building to procure which Presi - dent Seelye and the graduates and friends of the college have been putting forth strenuous efforts for more than a decade , took place on the twenty - seventh of last month , and was made memorable by a gathering of many distinguished guests and by the meeting of the
New England College Librarians ' Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		This latter body convened in the morn - ing and did what it could to promote the intellectual regeneration of man by discussing such questions as '' How Shall We Encourage Cultural Reading ? ''

		and a Is it Advisable for Colleges to Print Lists for Summer Reading ? ''

		and `` The Relation of Required Reading to the Capacity of Undergraduate Stu - dents , '' and '' Methods of Filing Newspaper Clip - pings , Extracts , etc. '' At the dedication exercises in the
afternoon	TIME	, President Seelye gave the history of the development of the
Smith College Library	ORGANIZATION	from the time it occupied what is now the
Regis	PERSON	- trar 's office to its removal into its present stately quarters .

		The orator of the day was Dr.
W. Dawson Johnston	PERSON	, Librarian of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, who spoke on '' Academic Ideals in Library Administra - tion , '' and emphasized the indispensability of trained and educated librarians to minister to the literary wants of college students .

		Miss
Josephine A. Clark	PERSON	, the college Librarian , called attention to the need of an endowment fund of at least a hundred thousand dollars for the proper development of the library now so handsomely provided with a home .

		The resources of the reference depart - ment of the well-equipped public library are ac - quiring dimensions that will ere long merit the adjective '' vast . ''

		General and technical cyclopae - dias , biographical dictionaries of the living and of the dead , concordances and other literary aids , lexi - cons in increasing size , atlases of growing bulk , -- these and many other kinds of helps to the studious and the curious are being produced with that plod - ding , untiring industry which has hitherto been regarded as preeminently characteristic of German scholarship .

		With the daily increasing number of special departments of learning and research , what will be the aspect of the reference room of a cen - tury hence ?

		Already the complaint reaches us from the
Providence Public Library	LOCATION	that this department is there suffering from acute congestion .

		More than thirteen hundred volumes of reference books , writes Mr.
Foster	PERSON	in his current Report , have been crowded out of the reference room to more or less distant parts of the building .

		But there is a pros - pect of ampler quarters , sometime .

		Dictionaries and encyclopaedias and similar works take up a great amount of shelf-room , but they are indispensable .


Ten million dollars	MONEY	for book-shelter , ex - pended on a single building , can not but seem a regrettably lavish outlay on externals .

		If we esti - mate the average cost of standard works in all departments of literature at
two dollars	MONEY	a volume -LRB- a rather high estimate -RRB- , we find that with this immense sum spent , or soon to be spent , on the great building in
Bryant Square	LOCATION	known as the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, a thousand collections of five thousand volumes each could be bought .

		A thou - sand small towns throughout our country could thus be provided with much-needed reading matter , in a sufficient quantity , for what has gone , in ways known to those who have studied the history of public buildings in this land of the politician and home of the grafter , to keep the wind and the weather from a single collection of public-library books .

		The first estimate of two and one-half mil - lion dollars as the probable cost of a structure worthy to serve as a central library for our metropolis was certainly a generous one ; and yet already nearly 416 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, four times that amount has been expended , and the end is not yet .

		Sometime in
1911	DATE	-- thirteen years after work began in preparing the ground for the new building -- its doors will probably be opened , and the public will see something more than the now long-familiar exterior of this monument to mu - nicipal extravagance and interminable red tape .

		• • • Poetry as a by-product of plodding toil in the least poetical of trades and callings fills a larger place in literature , especially current literature , than might be imagined .

		A
London	LOCATION	literary letter calls attention to the number of English verse-writers who are workingmen in the humbler walks of life .

		Although Mr.
William H. Davies	PERSON	, whose '' Farewell to Poesy '' has lately appeared , apparently prefers to be known as a tramp , there is Mr.
James Dryden Hosken	PERSON	, postman in
Cornwall	LOCATION	, occasional supernum - erary on the stage , one-time custom-house employee , and at present doing extra duty as librarian and secretary of a small religious establishment in his county .

		He was u discovered '' by Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	, and is the author of a volume of poems and a play .

		Mr.
Alfred Williams	PERSON	, another minor poet who may some day -LRB- who knows ? -RRB-

		develop into a major poet , works at his forge in Swindon by day and turns the graceful rhyme at night .

		Mr.
William Dowsing	PERSON	is an artificer in gutta-percha as well as in verse ; indeed , he works in a factory , an ordnance factory .

		On friendly terms with the muse are also '' A Railway Lad '' of
Belfast	LOCATION	, a Derby laborer who writes verses over the signature of '' Gurnet , '' and the ''
Galloway	PERSON	Poetess '' who is a mill girl .

		The well-known aialect poet , Mr.
Jonathan Denwood	PERSON	, is a draper in his uninspired hours .

		Is it that the eye of poetic imagi - nation , like the eye of physical sense , catches glimpses of certain things only by not being too directly fo - cussed on them ?

		`` Big brass generals '' as heroes of boys ' books have demonstrated their inability , despite all their brave trappings and splendid courage , to com - pete with the humbler and hence more easily con - ceivable '' ragged Dicks '' and '' tattered Toms '' of
Horatio Alger	PERSON	's creation .

		Mr.
E. T. Tomlinson	PERSON	, in his `` World 's Work '' article on `` The Perpetual Best Sellers , '' calls attention to the decline of
Henty	ORGANIZATION	's popularity and the continued vogue of Alger .

		One can well understand why it is that a Clive in
India	LOCATION	or a
Wolfe	LOCATION	in
Canada	LOCATION	seem to a boy reader far less real , less imitable in daily life , than a Ragged
Dick	PERSON	in the streets of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Yet theoretically , and on high artistic and moral grounds ,
Henty	ORGANIZATION	's bespangled heroes ought to do the young and ambitious reader far more good than
Alger	PERSON	's street gamins .

		But if the boys cry for
Alger	PERSON	and
Oliver Optic	PERSON	, and weary of sailing under
Drake	PERSON	's flag with Henty , it may be that for the promotion of honest American citizen - ship , rather than for the creation of British generals and admirals , whereof we are in no pressing need at present , the humbler and homelier tale will be of more service .

		Even impatient childhood ought not wholly to neglect
Tranio	ORGANIZATION	's counsel in `` The Taming of the Shrew , '' -- to '' study what you most affect . ''

		THE DIAL 417 & \ jt fUto goohs .

		Mill Revealed in his Letters .

		* '' To me it appears a very weighty matter to write a letter ; there is scarcely anything that we do which requires a more complete possession of our faculties . ''

		These words from an early epistle from
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	to
Carlyle	LOCATION	prepare us to learn that Mill composed his letters with the same conscientious care which he gave to his books .

		He wrote out a fair copy for the mail and preserved the rough original , corrected and interlined , for eventual publication .

		The bulk of the letters now for the first time published are taken from these first drafts .

		The Mill whom they present to us is essentially the Mill of the Autobiography .

		They give the history of a mind , and only indirectly the revelation of a personality .

		There were probably no new disclosures to be made .

		But if there were any , they have been withheld .

		There are no letters to the lady whom Carlyle styled '' Mrs.
Platonica Taylor	PERSON	, '' and none to the members of Mill 's family .

		Mr.
Elliot	PERSON	's Introduction is the sketchiest of biographies and characterizations .

		The '' Note on Mill 's private life '' by
Mary Taylor	PERSON	is a sincere but timid apology for Mill 's relations with Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	.

		The question detains us at the start only because the general nobility of Mill 's character and the unswerving rectitude of his conduct in all other relations of life make us reluctant to acknowledge any defects .

		The obvious external aspect of the matter was , as his father bluntly put it , `` that
John	PERSON	was in love with another man 's wife . ''

		But Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	had been forced into a loveless marriage as a girl , Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	acquiesced in the friendship with Mill , and Mill tells us that although he and Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	`` did not consider the ordinances of society binding in so purely personal a matter '' their relation was conventionally correct .

		Mill 's friends were rather amused at the infatuation of his judgment than shocked by any sense of impropriety in his conduct .

		Only
John Mill	PERSON	's reputation , they said , could stand the testimonials that he gave to his Egeria in prefaces and dedica - tions . ''

		She is a fine woman , '' said his brother , '' but nothing like what
John	PERSON	thinks . ''

		All the pent-up emotionality dammed by his unnatural education , and held in chec k through years of a • The Letter .

		purely intellectual existence , found vent in this passionate devotion .

		We can hardly blame him .

		More serious is the fault , first clearly revealed to the public in
Mary Taylor	PERSON	's apology , that he was permanently estranged from his mother because of her neglect to call upon Mrs.
Taylor	PERSON	the day after he had announced his intended marriage with her . ''

		Mill 's letters to his own family , '' says
Mary Taylor	PERSON	, `` are too many of them painful ... reading .

		He can not ... shake their faith in him as a ' great and good man . '

		He seems to endeavor to do this but fails .

		... It is wonderful to see a whole family thus loving and enduring .

		Not one bitter word is flung back to him . ''

		It is a pity .

		Mill seemed so nearly perfect -- the saint of positivism -- that we are saddened to find this flaw .

		But in default of fuller knowledge of all the conditions , we can not judge him .

		It is more profitable to turn at once to the letters which are given to the public and which deepen our admiration for the Mill that we know .

		The letters fall into two unequal groups : the more intimate letters written between the ages of twenty-two and thirty-eight mainly to
Stirling	LOCATION	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, and the vast almost impersonal correspondence of the recognized leader of lib - eral thought between the years
1847	DATE	and
1873	DATE	.

		For
John Stirling	PERSON	, the hero of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's vivid biography , Mill seems to have felt more warmth of affection than for any other man .

		He tells him , anticipating
Tennyson	PERSON	's words of Hallam : M I know no person who possesses more of what I have not than yourself . ''

		They were much separated , and of course were not at one in regard to religion .

		Four years after the corre - spondence opens Mill writes : '' I suspect that your mind and mine have passed that point in their respective orbits where they approximate most . ''

		But he continued to regard Stirling as '' quite the most lovable of all men I have known or ever look to know . ''

		And in the same last letter , written in answer to one announcing that his friend was at the point of death , he tells him : '' I have never so much wished for another life as I do for the sake of meeting you in it . ''

		The longest letter , written after a
summer	DATE	vacation at the Lakes , gives an interesting account of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Southey	PERSON	.

		What chiefly struck Mill in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	was `` the extensive range of his thought and the largeness and expansiveness of his feelings . ''

		Evidently
Peter Bell	PERSON	had more sides than he showed to
Shelley	PERSON	and
Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		`` Another acquaintance which I have recently made , '' writes Mill , '' is 418 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, that of Mr.
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		I have long had a very keen relish for his articles in the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and Foreign Reviews , which I formerly thought to be such consummate nonsense . ''

		About eight months later , we have the first letter to
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		Mill was at this time , as he tells
Carlyle	PERSON	two years afterward , in `` a state of reaction from logical utilitarian narrowness of the very nar - rowest kind , out of which after much unhappi - ness and inward struggling I had emerged and taken temporary refuge in its extreme opposite . ''

		This naturally brought the two men into a sem - blance of agreement that was not permanently possible for their temperaments .

		Mill 's scrupu - lous conscience is troubled by his suppression of .

		points of difference , and finally he makes full confession , adding : '' I have not till lately , and very gradually , found out that this is not honest . ''

		Carlyle of course reassures him that many divergencies of opinion will not alter his regard .

		The real difference , however , went deeper than abstract theology , of which at bottom
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	had as little as Mill .

		It was a difference of rhetoric , that is of psychology and temperament .

		Apropos of
Teufelsdrockh	LOCATION	, Mill ventures to ask '' whether this mode of writing between sarcasm or irony and earnest be really deserving of so much honor as you give to it by making use of it so frequently . ''

		Mill at this period of reaction from extreme Benthamism to appreciation of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Carlyle	PERSON	, conceived it to be his mission to mediate between the two schools of thought as he attempted to do in his essay on
Coleridge	PERSON	. ''

		If I have any vocation , '' he tells
Carlyle	PERSON	, `` it is exactly this , to translate the mysticism of others into argument . ''

		But
Carlyle	PERSON	, who cul - tivated metaphor , antithesis , paradox , and pic - turesque exaggeration , as assiduously as Mill suppressed them , could have no wish to see how his thoughts would look stripped of their gor - geous investiture and exposed in the uncom - promising garb of a style designed to reveal the precise truth and proportion of things .

		Mill could and always did humbly acknowledge the superiority of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's genius . ''

		I certainly could not now write , '' he says , '' and perhaps never shall be able to write , anything from which any person can derive so much edification as I , and several others , have derived in par - ticular from your paper on Johnson . ''

		Mill could understand and do justice to
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		It was impossible for
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	to perceive that in range of knowledge and power of reasoning he was a child compared to Mill .

		The correspondence with
Carlyle	PERSON	dies out after
1835	DATE	.

		The intensity of feeling on both sides in the
Eyre	LOCATION	controversy -LRB-
1866	DATE	-RRB- , and with regard to the war in
America	LOCATION	, must have em - phasized the incompatibility .


Carlyle	PERSON	said petulant things of Mill , as he did of every - body .

		Mill 's later estimate of
Carlyle	LOCATION	appears in a letter to
Thornton	PERSON	-LRB- by
Helen Taylor	PERSON	-RRB- in
1869	DATE	: '' It is only at a particular stage in one 's mental development that one benefits much by him ... but one continues to read his best things with little , if any , diminution of pleas - ure after one has ceased to learn anything from him . ''

		The multifarious correspondence from the year
1847	DATE	, aet .

		40 , to 1872 shows us Mill the authority whose opinions are sought on taxation , on the education of women , on flogging in the schools , on predestination , on profit-sharing , on the freedom of the will , on divorce for incom - patibility , on miracles , and on the value of a pretty face in a suffragette orator , as a means of influencing not men but women ; Mill the thinker exchanging views with
Grote	PERSON	,
Bain	ORGANIZATION	,
Ward	PERSON	, and
Taine	PERSON	, on the foundations of logio and psychology , the idea of cause , inconceiv - ability as a test of truth , and the systems of Comte ,
Spencer	PERSON	, and
Hamilton	LOCATION	; Mill the pub - licist and member of parliament consulting or consulted by the liberal leaders of
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	.

		We can only hint at the wealth of thought contained in these letters , or rather these finished little essays .

		A closely argued letter to
Gladstone	LOCATION	, on the
Alabama	LOCATION	Case , stands in immediate juxta - position with a searching criticism of
Spencer	PERSON	's philosophy addressed to
Bain	LOCATION	.

		A theory of the origin of the moral sentiments which evolution has not bettered is followed by a letter to
Villari	PERSON	on the situation of
Italy	LOCATION	in
1849	DATE	.

		The twentieth century can exhibit examples of like versatility of interests but none of equal competence .

		For Mill illumines , if he does not adorn , every topic on which he touches .

		Many of the letters are in defense or explana - tion of misunderstood passages in the `` Political Economy , '' the `` Logic , '' or the `` Utilitarian - ism . ''

		The abuse by Americans and
New Zea	LOCATION	- landers of Mill 's concession that protection of infant industries may sometimes be economically justifiable , led him to withdraw it altogether .

		To those who herald his `` Political Economy '' as a '' refutation of Socialism , '' he repeatedly explains that he is rather in sympathy with the ideals of socialism , though he thinks that it will
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 419 be long before the world is ripe for them .

		The considerable correspondence with Dr.
W. G. Ward	PERSON	displays Mill 's readiness to discuss phil - osophic problems with representatives of the opposite school , and his fairness and courtesy in weighing objections .

		To only a few does Mill write often or as a personal friend .

		Chief of them is the historian
Grote	PERSON	, of whose death , shortly before his own , he says to Villari : '' He was the oldest and by far the most valued of my surviving old friends . ''

		Next , perhaps , is
Alexander Bain	PERSON	, who survived him and wrote his life , who supplied many of the scientific illustrations for the
Logic	ORGANIZATION	, and with whom the subtlest problems of philosophy are frequently discussed .

		A large number of cordial letters , written mostly in French , are addressed to the Italian
Pasquale Villari	PERSON	, author of the standard work on
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many letters are acknowledgements of presentation copies or replies to such acknowledgments from those to whom he had sent his own books .

		In such cases Mill rarely confines himself to meaningless com - monplaces .

		He criticizes and replies to criti - cisms always in the spirit of what he says to
Thornton	PERSON	in reply to some animadversions on the Utilitarianism : '' Were you to attack my book or my arguments with any amount of severity , I should only see in the attack , coming from one of whose friendship I am so certain , an additional proof of friendship . ''

		Perhaps the only failure of the judicial temper in these volumes is the remark in a letter to Bain : '' I have found by actual experience of
Hegel	PERSON	that conversancy with him tends to deprave one 's intellect . ''

		Mill always took intense interest in American affairs .

		To his old philosophic adversary ,
Whewell	PERSON	, he writes : '' I have felt drawn to you by what I have heard of your sentiments respect - ing the American struggle ... No question of our time has been such a touchstone of men . ''

		How splendidly Mill himself stood the test is known to all readers of the magnificent paper on '' The Conflict in
America	LOCATION	, '' published in
1862	DATE	.

		His American correspondents include
Motley	ORGANIZATION	,
Parke Godwin	PERSON	,
Godkin	PERSON	,
E. L. Youmans	PERSON	, Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	,
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, and others .

		He is not blinded by his enthusiasm for American liberalism .

		To a
South Carolina Library Committee	ORGANIZATION	, in
1854	DATE	, he expresses the tempered hope that '' the
United States	LOCATION	may lead the way to mental and moral as they have already done to much political freedom . ''

		He tells
Motlev	PERSON	that the war which has called forth so much heroism and constancy has also exhib - ited `` the incompetency and mismanagement arising from the fatal belief of your people that anybody is fit for anything . ''

		And writing to Mr.
Brace	PERSON	, of
New York	LOCATION	, in
1871	DATE	, he fears that the ultimate result of the '' organized system of plunder of the many by the few which is called protection '' will be to place '' all Americans in a circle , each with his hand in the pocket of his right-hand neighbor '' -- therein anticipating , if we mistake not , a recent cartoon .

		This review must close , although nothing has been said of '' votes for women , '' the cause of high prices , taxation of the unearned incre - ment , spiritualism ; estimates of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Darwin	PERSON	, and
Spencer	PERSON	; and countless other top - ics as interesting and as timely as any touched upon in this rapid survey .

		Mill on principle avoided rather than sought sententiousness and epigram .

		But he comes perilously near them in the observation : '' Reformers should assert principles and only accept -LSB- not propose -RSB- com - promises ; '' or in the remark addressed to a Sabbatarian : '' Any place unfit to be open on
Sunday	DATE	is unfit to be open at all . ''

		Many of the later letters are here said to have been composed in whole or part by his secretary ,
Helen Taylor	PERSON	.

		I can not think that all of these ascriptions are correct .

		I should be loth to believe it of the sentence , '' But then I am a man '' -LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 100 -RRB- .

		And it is not probable that she wrote the characteristic French letter to

		420 THE DIAI , -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, The Theatre of To-Day .

		* In its attitude toward the theatre , the present generation has been living in a transition period .

		Forty years ago , the theatre was regarded simply as an amusement ; actors -LRB- except a few of the greatest -RRB- were social outcasts ; the writing of plays was counted unworthy of the best pens ; the drama , in
John Hare	PERSON	's happy phrase , was the Cinderella of the arts .

		We have lived to see the theatre regarded as one of the most power - ful agents for the education of the people , the actor the most feasted , photographed , and flat - tered of men during his life , and promptly made the subject of elaborate biography at his death ; the writing of plays the greatest ambition of every young writer ; courses in the technique of the drama offered at most of our great uni - versities ; a play -LRB- '' Salvation Nell '' -RRB- accepted in place of a thesis from a candidate for Master 's degree at
Harvard	LOCATION	; and Cinderella the most pampered , caressed , and courted of the art sisters .

		With such and so great changes going on under our eyes , it is inevitable that the old books dealing with the theatre -- even the books of ten years ago -- should have become quite obsolete ; inevitable also that the new books dealing with dramatic art , dramatic composi - tion , dramatic ideals as they exist to-day , should be of a wholly new type .

		Their mission is to trace this new trend of the times -- to help us to decide whether we are justified in tak - ing the theatre seriously , and if so , why .

		Thus artistic and literary criticism fares forth on a new path , to meet new situations , to cast forth , if may be , the lingering ghosts of Puritanism that have hovered about the stage so long and have prejudiced or terrified so many worthy persons .

		A delightful escort into this new region is Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	in his book on '' The Theory of the Theatre . ''

		Although some of the chapters have had previous publication in the magazines , the treatment is not in the least scrappy ; he answers the questions and explains the problems in proper order , and in an analytic fashion very satisfactory to all who wish to look below the surface of things .

		It is by no means superfluous that the author first takes up and answers the apparently simple question , What is a Play ?

		A play not being a composition intended primarily to be read , the attempt to * The Theory of the Theatre , and
Other Principles of Dramatic Criticism	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	.

		New York :
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		test it by its literary quality only , or even chiefly , involves an academic fallacy .

		The very plays that we now read in the closet were in - tended primarily to be presented on the stage .

		So immeasurably superior as a poet is Shake - speare to
Dryden	PERSON	that it is difficult for the col - lege student to realize that , considered solely as a play , Shakespeare 's ''
Antony	PERSON	and Cleopatra '' is far inferior to Dry den 's '' All for Love , or The World Well Lost , '' dealing with the same characters .

		Shakespeare 's play is merely dra - matized history ;
Dryden	PERSON	's is constructed with a sense of economy and emphasis that makes it historical drama .

		The beautiful and poetic passages in all of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays make it hard to realize that some of them -- like '' Cymbeline '' -- are really very bad as plays .

		From the standpoint of the theatre , therefore , literature is only one of a multitude of means which the dramatist must employ to convey his story effectively to his audience .

		To be remem - bered by posterity he must cultivate literary excellence , but he need not write greatly to secure the plaudits of his own generation .

		As a matter of fact , an audience is not capable of hearing whether the dialogue of a play is well or badly written .

		What really moves it at Hamlet 's line , '' Absent thee from felicity awhile , '' is not the perfectness of the phrase but the pathos of Hamlet 's plea for his best friend to outlive him in order to explain his motives to a world grown harsh .

		The problem of the dramatist is less a task of writing than a task of constructing .

		His primary concern is so to build a story that it will tell itself to the eye of the audience in a series of shifting pictures .

		Any really good play can be appreciated , to a great extent , even though acted in a foreign tongue . ''

		Hamlet , '' being a great masterpiece of meditative poetry , would of course lose much if deprived of its lit - erary quality ; but it is , besides , so great as a play that its essential interest would remain if it were shown in moving pictures .

		Every play - wright understands that the scenario is more important than the dialogue ; before a line of the dialogue is written , it is possible in most cases to determine , from a full scenario , whether a prospective play is good or bad .

		An important difference between drama and most of the other arts is that it is designed to appeal to a crowd instead of to an individual .

		As Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	, the author of the work be - fore us , says : '' We have to be alone in order to appreciate the ` Venus of Milo , ' or the '
Sistine Madonna	PERSON	, ' or the
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 421 ' Ode to a Nightingale , ' or ' The Egoist , ' or the '
Religio Medici	PERSON	, ' but who could sit alone in a wide theatre and see ' Cyrano de Bergerac ' performed ?

		The sympa - thetic presence of a multitude of people would be as necessary to our appreciation of the play as solitude in all the other cases . ''

		Hence the playwright must take into account the psychology of a crowd .

		A crowd is less intellectual and more emotional than the indi - viduals that compose it .

		The dramatist , there - fore , because he writes for a crowd writes for a comparatively uncivilized and uncultivated mind , a mind richly human , vehement in appro - bation , emphatic in disapproval , easily credulous , eagerly enthusiastic , boyishly heroic , and some - what carelessly unthinking .

		A theatre audience is composed of all sorts and conditions of men , -- the rich and the poor , the literate and the illit - erate , the old and the young , the native and the naturalized .

		It follows that the dramatist in the same single work of art must incorporate elements that will interest them all .

		A theatre audience wants to have its emotions played upon ; it seeks amusement -- in the widest sense of the word -- amusement through laughter , sympathy , terror , tears .

		And it is amusement of this sort that the great dramatists have ever given it .

		Yet once they have fulfilled this prime necessity , they may also write -LRB- and the greatest always do write -RRB- secondarily for the few .

		So full of human interest is '' Othello , '' so great is its constructive skill , that it appeals to the rab - ble in a thirty-cent show ; but
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, being a great poet as well as a great play - wright , employed a verse that , though lost upon the throng , lingers forever in the ears of the few .

		`` Not poppy , nor mandr agora , Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world , Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep Which thou own ` st yesterday . ''

		The greatest dramatist of all , in writing for the crowd , did not forget the individual .

		In discussing the evolution of the drama , the drama of to-day is called the
Drama of Illu	LOCATION	- sion , to distinguish it from its predecessors , the
Drama of Rhetoric	ORGANIZATION	and the
Drama of Conver	ORGANIZATION	- sation .

		Ask the average theatre-goer about the merits of a play , he will praise it not for its stately speeches -LRB- as Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	praised u Gorboduc '' -RRB- , not for its clever repartee -LRB- as
Dryden	PERSON	praised the Restoration drama -RRB- , but because it was '' so natural . ''

		Sunsets and starlit skies , moonlight rippling over moving waves , fires that really burn , windows of actual glass , fountains plashing with real water , all of the naturalistic devices of our Drama of Illusion , have been developed in the last few decades -- largely due to the possibilities of elec - tric lighting .

		Moreover , besides a whole new set of stage conventions we have a wholly new type of drama -- the modern social drama , popularly known as the problem-play .

		It came into exist - ence about the
fourth decade of the nineteenth century	DATE	; but in less than eighty years it has shown itself to be the fittest expression in dramaturgic terms of the spirit of the present age , and it is now adopted to the exclusion of almost every other type .

		It is continually assailed by a certain set of critics , and by another set continually defended .

		Especially has its morality been a theme of bitter conflict .

		Critics have been so busy calling
Ibsen	PERSON	and his followers either corrupters of the mind or great ethical teachers , that they have not found leisure to consider the more general and less conten - tious questions of what the modern social drama really is and on what ground its morality should be determined .

		The distinguishing character of this new type -- our modern social drama -- is that the individual is displayed in conflict with his environment .

		A mighty war is waging between personal character and social conditions .

		The Greek hero struggled with the superhuman ; the Elizabethan hero struggled with himself ; the modern hero struggles with the world .

		On the one side are the legions of society ; on the other side , a man .

		They who belittle the im - portance of the modern social drama and regard it as an arbitrary phase of art devised for busi - ness reasons merely , by a handful of clever play - wrights , have read but ill the signs of the times .

		For the most important topic of our day is pre - cisely this : the relation between the one and the many , in politics , in business , in religion , in the every-day dealings of men and women with each other .

		The theatre does not and ought not to shirk these problems .

		The morality or immorality of certain plays is not a question of subject-matter .

		There is no such thing per se as an immoral subject for a play ; in the treatment of the subject , and only in the treatment , lies the basis for ethical judgment of the piece .

		Critics who condemn '' Ghosts '' because of its subject-matter might as well condemn M Othello '' because of its subject-matter -- might as well condemn it be - cause the hero kills his wife : what a suggestion , look you , to carry into our homes !

		`` Macbeth '' is not immoral , though the play makes night hideous with murders .

		A dramatist is immoral 422 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, only when he is untrue .

		To make us pity his characters when they are vile or love them when they are noxious , to invent excuses for them in situations when they can not be excused , -- in a word , to lie about his characters , -- this is for the dramatist the one unpardonable sin .

		To it must be added a second , almost equally great -- to allure the audience to generalize falsely in regard to life at large , from the specific cir - cumstances of his play .

		Because plays are so rarely printed now-a-days , it is chiefly through attending plays , and studying what lies beneath the acting and behind the presentation , that even the most well-intentioned critic of contem - porary drama can discover what our dramatists are driving at .

		But the theatre is a business as well as an art .

		Therefore the critic who considers the drama of to-day must often turn from problems of art to problems of economics .

		He must seek for the root of certain evils , not in the technical methods of the dramatists , but in the business methods of the managers .

		At present , there are too many theatres ; there is an over - production which is unsound not only from the business standpoint , but in the long run it is likely to alienate the more thoughtful class of theatre-goers .

		In a fine chapter on '' The Function of the Imagination , '' our author concludes his book by defining the proper function of the dramatist . ''

		To imagine some aspect of the perennial struggle between human wills so forcibly as to make us realize it in the full sense of the word , -- realize it as we daily fail to realize the countless struggles we ourselves engage in , the Theatre , rightly considered , is not a place in which to escape from the realities of life , but a place in which to seek refuge from the unrealities of actual living in the contemplation of life realized , -- life made real by imagination . ''

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's book is dedicated '' To
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, Mentor and Friend '' ; and it does indeed show traces throughout of the older man 's influence .

		Nevertheless , it occupies a place distinctly its own , and bears well a com - parison with Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	's almost simulta - neous '' Study of the Drama . ''

		In a general way Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	is more academic , Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	more popular without being less critical or scholarly .

		Like Macaulay in his reviews , he brings his subject '' down to last
Saturday	DATE
night	TIME	, '' and hence his book will be of great help to readers and playgoers who are not quite clear why the theatre of to-day is something to be reckoned with in all sincerity and seriousness .


Anna Benneson McMahan	PERSON	.

		Is Pragmatism Pragmatic ; ?

		* '' Pragmatism asks its usual question Grant an idea or belief to be true , it says , what concrete difference will its being true make in any one 's actual life ?

		What experiences may be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false ?

		How will the truth be realized ?

		What , in short , is the truth 's cash-value in experiental terms ?

		The moment pragmatism asks this question , it sees the answer : True ideas are those that we can assimilate , validate , corroborate , and verify .

		False ideas are those that we can not . ''

		--
William James	PERSON	. ''

		There is no difference that does not make a differ - ence .

		The best of theories must be found in practice .

		The pragmatic philosophy is a renewed emphasis of this truth .

		It is a philosophy of doing , and of knowing only in relation to doing .

		It is a philosophy of work , of activity , of enterprise , of achievement .

		And for this reason it has taken up arms against all forms of dogma - tism and apriorism , in so far as these stand for intel - lectual interests which do not grow out of , nor minister to , the needs of life . ''

		--
H. H. Bawden	PERSON	. ''

		Note that I have no reproach to urge against society for being pragmatic , that is to say , for watching over its own interests .

		On the contrary , I think it is perfectly legitimate that it should do so .

		And , besides , the word ' interests ' may be taken in the widest , or , if you please , most elevated sense .

		But I do reproach a school of modern philosophers for wishing to force impersonal philosophy , a moral science , indifferent nature , to speak the same language as our aspirations and our passions , and even , I grant , our generous aspirations , our noble passions .

		Our innate and psychic tendencies -LRB- in the moral , social , and religious realms -RRB- are phenomena for science to record and authenticate , not to justify or legitimize . ''

		-- A
Ibert Schinz	PERSON	.

		Pragmatism is not a new philosophy ; it is the name of a movement seeking to alter the trend of philosophic thought so as to lay emphasis on practical values .

		Philosophy , if hitherto a wild thing of the woods , is now to be harnessed to the cart of our needs , and with a little train - ing may prove a serviceable and docile beast .

		It is feared by some , however , that when this happens philosophy will no longer lead us any - where , but will have to be driven .

		The nag may be easier to hitch and better to go than the star , but will it have as constant a sense of direction ?

		It is curious that this controversy should ever have arisen .

		With the partial exception of man , all living nature is frankly pragmatic .

		It is an axiom of the biologist that every creature lives for itself , and no case is known in which one species possesses any activity solely for the good of another , much less for no good at all .

		THE DIAL , 423 few supposed cases of this sort , such as that of the plant in forming a gall for the gall-fly , break down on examination .

		It is not rarely true that the individual is sacrificed for the species , but each species has no other object than its own preservation .

		This being the case , pragmatism -LRB- '' opportunism in philosophy '' Mr.
Schinz	PERSON	calls it -RRB- seems natural and inevitable , and any de - parture from it suicidal in the long run .

		Shall there be a science or a philosophy which deals with things that are absolutely of no consequence to human life ?

		Put in this way , the question is absurd .

		Professor
Schinz	PERSON	has no such idea ; the quarrel really is on the question '' What is worth while ? ''

		Professor James says -- and all other pragmatists repeat -- that , for us , things are not different if they make no differences .

		This again is in some sort an absurdity ; for we could not conceive them to be different if they really were psychological equivalents , while if they were metaphysical we could not conceive of them at all .

		The real crux of the debate can be represented by the query , Is pragmatism pragmatic ?

		Does the particular kind of philo - sophic emphasis represented by the pragmatic school , in the largest sense and in the longest run , really serve the best needs of mankind ?

		For our guidance , we may take note of the history of science .

		For long ages science pro- gressed hardly at a snail 's pace ; in the
last two hundred years	DATE	it has passed through a trot to a gallop , and , so far as we can see , will shortly take to an aeroplane .

		This tremendous accel - eration may be partly explained in the sense of maturity following a long period of youth , but it must be mainly due to a difference in method .

		The science of the middle ages mostly revolved in circles or followed blind alleys .

		With some brilliant exceptions , it was academic in the sense of being apart from life .

		It was contemplative rather than progressive , static rather than dy - namic .

		It is not true to-day that it made no difference , even in its least valuable forms ; but as compared with its modern representative , it made very little .

		The study of a grasshopper 's hind leg , as carried on to-day , is more worth while , intellectually and practically , than was the study of the universe at a time when the student asked no question but '' What do the ancient classics say ? ''

		Pragmatism , then , if we may venture to interpret it briefly , accuses philosophy -LRB- and ultimately some other things ! -RRB-

		of being in large part where science was several hundred years ago .

		If it tries to prove that these things have no purpose and no meaning -- even the poorest of them -- it will fail ; but taking the stand that we must get the greatest amount of good out of life , and that our philosophy must be a going concern , it appears to be abundantly justified .

		There is , indeed , a danger on the other side .

		There are many signs that science in these days tends to become so opportunistic that it denies itself the larger outlook , and eventually defeats its own ends .

		The advice to seek first the kingdom of heaven is as sound as it ever was ; and there can be no doubt that the adoption of pragmatic ideals would in crasser minds lend justification to conduct which , from the stand - point of the race , would be highly injurious .

		Perhaps we may put the thing in this form : Science progresses in proportion to its work - ableness and unity .

		Philosophy might do the same , but the ordinary individual is something like a planet kept in its course by the interaction of two -LRB- or more -RRB- opposing forces .

		To him , a single consistent working philosophy would per - haps be destructive , just as though one of the factors in a balance had been removed .

		It would necessarily accumulate around the larger influences in his life , and if these were good , well enough ; but if they were inferior , what then ?

		This , I think , is the real essence of the anti-pragmatist position ; and it can not be lightly disposed of .

		To those who are conservative by training and disposition , the ancient cobwebs in the halls of learning seem beautiful and precious ; to others -LRB- including the writer -RRB- it seems that they should be removed , for we have better things to put in their places .

		We desire for Professor James the longest broom and strong - est arm ; but we are not sure that we wish the whole household to go spider-hunting .

		We suspect , in fact , that some are not expert arachnologists .

		After all this , we have not described the con - tents of the books that have formed the text of our discourse , but have merely tried to indicate in some manner the nature of their subject .

		It should be said about Professor
Schinz	PERSON	, that he really represents what from our standpoint is a reactionary social policy .

		We do not agree with his opinions on things in general , and do regard him as a defender of cobwebs ; but that does not prevent the recognition of the valid part of his argument .

		Professor
Bawden	PERSON	's book is really a general treatise on philosophy and psychology , and it does not seem to us that the title accurately describes the contents .

Sheridan	PERSON	and his Contemporaries .

		It is doubtful if there is in the whole range of the eighteenth century a man more fascinating to the biographer than
Richard Brinsley Sheridan	PERSON	, and that too in a century crowded with remark - able and picturesque men ; yet it is not till now , nearly a hundred years after his death , that we have a just and adequate biography of him .

		Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	's work gives us the real
Sheridan	PERSON	in his proper environment ; it presents him in all the pomp and circumstance of his age .

		Equally brilliant , as Lord
Holland	PERSON	said , '' in the closet , the theatre , and the senate , ''
Sheridan	PERSON	had a personality as varied as it was attractive , as contradictory as it was persuasive .

		He was in some respects a genuine child of the century .

		He had all the sentimentalism and melancholy of the time .

		He was in sympathetic touch with the new romanticism , as is shown by an Ossianic fragment quite in the fashion of the romantic
Macpherson	PERSON	, which Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	gives us .

		And yet again he was no mere child of the period .

		He was a democrat at a time when the haughty Duchess of Buckingham could say of the Meth - odists , `` It is monstrous to be told that you have a heart as sinful as the common wretches that crawl on the earth .

		This is highly offensive and revolting . ''

		In an age when political purity was a largely negligible quantity , he was above a bribe and he could therefore the more effectively prosecute
Warren Hastings	PERSON	.

		But he was most of all a
Sheridan	PERSON	, the grandson of the erratic and guileless Dr.
Thomas Sheridan	PERSON	, Swift 's friend , who on the anniversary of the accession of the Hanoverians innocently preached on the text , '' Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof . ''

		His procrastination was as notorious as his care - lessness .

		His wife speaks of '' the bottomless pit of his pocket , '' and records that '' anything in his hands is irrecoverable . ''

		He would dis - charge large sums that were not even claims , and yet leave his old servants ,
Martha	PERSON	and
Sarah	PERSON	, coalless and without their wages .

		He was '' god - like in giving but the devil to pay . ''

		When his purse was full , he would empty it for chil - dren and servants ; and he would push over an `` 10 U '' with the exclamation , anticipating
Micawber	PERSON	, '' Thank God , that 's settled . ''

		His wit was unfailing ; even when he lay dying besieged by bailiffs , he ordered a placard to be placed with this inscription : '' I know your necessities before you ask them and your ignorance in ask - ing . ''

		sensitiveness to suffering , as shown , for instance , when his first wife died , his beautiful and accom - plished
St. Cecilia	LOCATION	.


Sheridan	PERSON	's Irish origin helps in part to ex - plain the man ; but , as Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	says : '' This is not all .

		He was no ordinary Irishman , nor , indeed , an ordinary being .

		Take his career .

		His prog - ress seemed slow , but his successes were sudden .

		He became great , as it were , by stealth .

		He sauntered into notice and glided into fame .

		He stole into the wills and affections of men and women by a wizardry of his own .

		Yet out of many incongruous colours , which at first sight might seem to baffle portraiture , a distinct picture emerges ... The knight of the free lance enters the lists , tilts at bewitched quintains , and in every tournament carries away the prize ... He owns the talisman of personal magnetism , and often as the courtiers turn on their heel -- their wont when genius blocks the way -- he calmly pursues the zigzag of his course with an inscrutable smile that wins them back again .

		But the plaudits die away .

		Without an audience he broods and dies .

		He waits , drowning reflection , and draining bumper on bumper to the past which he vows to retrieve .

		A fresh bugle-call dispels his apathy .

		He starts eager from his cups , charges new enemies , and gathers fresh laurels .

		Once more he feels invincible , till , too often the world 's dupe and his own , disillusion - ized , though never soured , battered by disease , intemper - ance , and distresses , he sinks at length into a neglected death-bed but an honoured grave . ''

		Such is the man that Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	admirably portrays in two large volumes of over a thou - sand pages .

		But he does more .

		He outlines the century as the fitting background for the pic - ture , and shows
Sheridan	PERSON	's relations to the mul - tifarious activities of the age .

		It was the time of
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Sterne	PERSON	, of the American and the French Revolutions ; it was a carnival of drinking and gambling , and of '' bare , bald cor - ruption '' in politics ; it was an age of scandal , immortalized in
Sheridan	PERSON	's comedy , of extortion , of preciosity and brutality , of taste and turbu - lence , of color and costume , of gallantry and gaiety .

		And all this Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	illustrates from the careers of
Sheridan	PERSON	and his contemporaries .

		The course of
Sheridan	PERSON	's life , his courtship and runaway marriage with the beautiful and talented
Miss Linley	PERSON	, his duels with his rival , his remarkable success with the drama , his social and political rise to the very foot of the throne , reads like a romance , and it loses none of its effectiveness in this spirited narrative .

		And Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	is scholarly and as interesting whether he is treating
Sheridan	PERSON	's literary and dramatic work or tracing his steps to the elo - quent arraignment of
Warren Hastings	PERSON	.

		His discussion of '' The Rivals '' and '' The School for Scandal '' is a sound piece of literary criti - cism .

		He traces the evolution of '' The School '' from the sheet of dialogue for '' The Slander -
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 425 ers -- A Pump-Room Scene , '' through two short scenes , one satirizing an ill-assorted match -LRB- the
Teazle	PERSON	story -RRB- , the other a melodramatic comedy of jealousy and intrigue , which is the real nu - cleus of the plot , to the perfect comedy .

		The charge of plagiarism is disposed of , and the relation to
Sheridan	PERSON	's predecessors in comedy is dealt with at some length .

		An interesting sketch is given of contemporary and subsequent performances of `` The School for Scandal '' down to the masterly revival by Mr.
Beerbohm	PERSON	Tree last
summer	DATE	in
London	LOCATION	.

		A considerable amount of new material has enabled Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	to reveal the
Sheridan	PERSON	of politics and society as he has not been hitherto known .

		The Diary of
Georgiana	LOCATION	,
Duchess of Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	, from
November 20 , 1788	DATE	, to Jan -
uary 12 , 1789	DATE	, gives interesting glimpses of him , and is especially entertaining in its account of the insanity of
George III.	PERSON	, for she tells a goodly number of the things he did when really crazy .

		Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	has been able , moreover , to recover parts of
Sheridan	PERSON	's great speeches , especially the Begum speech preliminary to the trial of
Warren Hastings	PERSON	, and the still greater speech of the trial itself -- the speech that took four days to deliver , that was heard by all the social and political world , and that was the crowning glory of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		The re - lation of
Sheridan	PERSON	to the French Revolution , his opposing
Burke	PERSON	and defending the French , his condemnation of the war against
France	LOCATION	, and his loyal defence of
England	LOCATION	against the threat - enings of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, is discussed with insight and sympathy .

		The pathos of
Sheridan	PERSON	's later life is brought out with all the affection of a lover . ''

		Exclusion , '' says Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	, '' forms the motto of these dismal years -LRB- 1809-1812 -RRB- : exclusion from the theatre , exclusion from his party , exclusion eventually from
Carlton House	ORGANIZATION	, and exclusion from St.
Stephen	PERSON	's . ''

		The closing chapter is sad indeed ; disease and poverty were followed by death , and then , as in keeping with the strange changes of fortune that marked his whole career , his burial was in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	with all that the nation accords those whom she delights to honor .


Sheridan	PERSON	's life was a remarkable one , for the man himself was remarkable , -- so much so that Mr.
Sichel	PERSON	seems justified in saying that he remains '' a sprite , hovering above the puppet - show of existence .

		He belongs not to the white-robed immortals who sit radiant and aloft , but to the elfin band who have never faded from our atmosphere .

		His province is not history but wonderland . ''

		* Nature is not the same thing as scenery , nor is scenery the same thing as landscape .

		And it may be that both Dr.
Myra Reynolds	PERSON	and Mr.
Birge Harrison	PERSON	will think it is confusing what they wish to make clear , to put together their two books -- one on the poetic treatment of Nature in the eighteenth century and the other on landscape-painting at the present day .

		Really , however , there is a good deal of con - nection .

		Miss
Reynolds	PERSON	, it is true , deals with a larger topic in a broader field .

		She speaks • of the sense of Nature in general , as exhibited in literature , painting , landscape-gardening , travel ; while Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	writes especially of pictures .

		Still , although it is a mistake to con - fuse the arts , and to speak as though they were all much the same sort of thing -- except per - haps in material and audience , -- yet these two books show a difference in general culture and thought that is very interesting .

		Our feeling in art at the present day differs decidedly from that of the age of Queen
Anne	PERSON	.

		That the classicism of Pope gave way in the course of a hundred years to the romanticism of
Byron	PERSON	, of
Shelley	LOCATION	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, is a com - monplace ; as also that this change of artistic feeling is to be observed in other forms of cul - ture than literature .

		Music and painting have had their classicism and their romanticism as well as poetry , though their times and sea - sons in the different nations of
Europe	LOCATION	have been rather different .

		The transitions of the eighteenth century are very clear , but it is not always clear what changes may have occurred since .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, concerned with the artistic things of art rather than the speculative or the historical , makes a remark that suggests the result as far as landscape painting is concerned .

		Miss
Reynolds	PERSON	has a chapter on landscape paint - ing in the eighteenth century , in which -LRB- besides collecting a splendid mass of material -RRB- she traces the development of a love of nature among English painters , and , indeed , writes : '' But in abundance and variety of theme the English landscape artists have by the end of the century surpassed even the poetry of the period '' -LRB- p. 321 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	, however , writes : '' Not until the
early years of the nineteenth century	DATE	, and then in far-away
England	LOCATION	, did the first ♦ The
Treatment of Nature	ORGANIZATION	in English Poetrt between Pope and

		426 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, true school of landscape make its appearance '' -LRB- p. 5 -RRB- .

		This does not mean that Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has never heard of
Richard Wilson	PERSON	, is unaware of
Gainsborough	LOCATION	's painting every tree within miles of
Ipswich	LOCATION	, does not know that there was a painter named
Girvin	PERSON	.

		It simply means that he holds that the movement which began with
Crome	ORGANIZATION	,
Borington	LOCATION	,
Cotman	PERSON	, Constable , in
the first quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	, has so influenced modern painting that whatever went before is simply not worth considering .

		All this has no bearing on the historical char - acter of Miss
Reynolds	PERSON	's facts and deductions ; but it has something to do with what we shall think of her book and Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's , and what we shall think of the nature and the art that they present .

		And this will be the case even more here in
America	LOCATION	than elsewhere , because in
America	LOCATION	the influences traced by Miss Rey - nolds had more free play than in
Europe	LOCATION	, where they almost at once were confused with other powerful forces , and also because the influences of which Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	writes have hardly been of importance for more than thirty or forty years .

		For we shall want to read the books of those two authors , I take it , not merely as his - toric or artistic treatises , but because we may find in them guidance , stimulus , suggestion , or what not , for our own thinking and feeling and enjoyment of nature , whether in the garden or in the woods , and in art whether in picture or in poetry .

		We read of the rise of romanticism out of classicism , and are interested because we enjoy those things that were dear to the romantic soul ; or we read of the ideas and principles of modern schools of landscape , because it makes clearer to us the beauty of the last picture we saw , or opens to us the beauty of some new one .

		As we read and appreciate how the English poets came to enjoy and love the mountains and the lakes , we feel that we understand all that ; as we read of the change from the trim and clipped conventionality of the formal garden to the open and free English parks we enjoy that too ; as we look at the difference between the early classic landscapes of
Wilson	PERSON	and his later more romantic scenes , or as we look at
Gainsborough	PERSON	and think of
Claude	PERSON	, we feel that we understand the change , even that it is a part of us .

		Somewhat disconcerting , then , is the idea that that view of landscape -LRB- at least -RRB- is non-existent to-day ; that in all that reading we were merely interesting ourselves in archaeology ; that if we wish to be modern we must become acquainted with other feelings , other emotions , other ideals ; that
Gainsborough	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Repton	PERSON	are now historical , and that art to-day has masters of very different kind .

		In
America	LOCATION	, as has been said , this feeling will be stronger than elsewhere , for in
America	LOCATION	our traditional ideas of beauty in landscape and in poetry and in landscape-painting developed directly , and without much external influence , from the ideas of
England	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century .

		When Constable and Borington were impressing the simple quiet claim of domestic scenery , as well as their very striking mode of rendering it , upon
Rousseau	PERSON	and Millet ,
Thomas Cole	PERSON	and
Asher Durand	PERSON	were carrying out the romantic ideals of
Wilson	PERSON	and
Gainsborough	PERSON	, just as
Cooper	PERSON	and Irving were carrying out the romantic conceptions of scenery that we love in Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		The result was aided by the fact that
America	LOCATION	had much of the wild and romantic in her scenery .

		Our mountains and our rivers , with their gorges and waterfalls , aroused and stimulated a pleasure in the free and grandiose forms of nature that has by no means died out .

		In the eighteenth century
Europe	LOCATION	learned the beauty of the mountain ; and , in
America	LOCATION	at least , the lesson has not been forgotten .

		It is probable that more visitors to the Metropolitan Museum admire the great picture of the
Rocky Mountains	ORGANIZATION	by
Bierstadt	PERSON	than pause before all the pictures by
George Innes	PERSON	put together .

		This does not show that it is better for one to do so , but simply that such is the widely-prevailing popular feeling for land - scape in
America	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Reynolds	PERSON	's book treats admirably the growth of this sentiment in
England	LOCATION	in the eighteenth century .

		Originally a study only of poetry , it has been extended to cover the other fields of art and culture , and now gives an immensely interesting study of the growth of the romantic love of nature .

		Her reading is very wide and her treatment includes much , indeed almost everything that one can think of .

		For myself , I must confess that she seems rather to lack temperament , or at least the power to convey temperament .

		Take
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, for instance .

		We learn much from her about
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, -- that he was most sensitive to the sights and sounds of nature , that he wrote from a deep personal experience , that he knew the sterner phenomena of nature and also her less ordinary phases , that he loved her for her own sake .

		But with all that , I miss some apprecia - tion of why or how it was that
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	thought that these were the great things of life , the things that poetry should render .

		In the mass of facts that she has gathered and so clearly
1910	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 427 correlated ,
Miss Reynolds	PERSON	often seems at a loss to appreciate values .

		Of
Wilson	PERSON	, for instance : it is delightful to find in her book some of
Wilson	ORGANIZATION	's Welsh pictures which will be new to all but the student of his art .

		But what is it in
Wilson	LOCATION	that gives him still something of a hold on painter and public alike ?

		What is there , in other words , of value in this romantic view of nature ?

		At a time like ours , when that view is being lost in the past , when one is likely to be distracted by all sorts of more modern interests , one would gladly find some '' apprecia - tion -LRB- as they say -RRB- of the spirit of romantic art .

		Miss
Reynolds	PERSON	will perhaps remind us that her work is historic and not critical ; and cer - tainly in the field of the history of culture she has produced a book that one can not do without .

		I know of no other place where so much of value in its own field is given , where the course of general culture of that day is so well exhibited .

		I presume there are deficiencies and errors in the book , but certainly not very many .

		If there be a lack , I should find it in the failure some - times to give adequate causes or reasons for the phases of feeling that she chronicles .

		Thus -- just for one thing -- take the love of mountain scenery .

		One may find in Miss
Reynolds	PERSON	's pages the successive steps of its growth in poetry , pic - ture , travel .

		But where did the feelingr come from ?

		If one is going to deal with literary history , this is certainly a fair question .

		Miss Reynolds -- unless I have missed something -- says nothing about it .

		She quotes in a footnote , and without comment , the commonplace that
Rousseau	PERSON	opened the eyes of
Europe	LOCATION	to the beauty of the Alps .

		But that has little appli - cation to
England	LOCATION	: long before the ''
Nouvelle Heloise	PERSON	'' was thought of ,
Horace Walpole	PERSON	and
Thomas Gray	PERSON	had appreciated to the full the wonders of the Alps .

		They were probably themselves not the first ; probably there were always in
England	LOCATION	those who were struck by the wild and grand in mountain scenery .

		Evelyn in
the seventeenth century	DATE	is not without appre - ciation of mountains , nor Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu	PERSON	at the beginning of the eighteenth .

		They liked other things better , doubtless , as did
Horace Walpole	PERSON	; but , like him , they felt but now and then the romantic wildness of mountain scenery .

		It was to them , perhaps , an escape from the conventional which they otherwise loved , an opening of a new horizon , as it has been to so many since their day .

		It may be the exhilaration of the discovery of a new world that gives character to the newer landscape of which Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	writes .

		One ; will find in his book few , perhaps none , of the motives noted by
Miss Reynolds	PERSON	.

		If we may judge from him , it would be a matter of indiffer - ence to an artist whether he painted a mountain or a haystack in the pasture .

		That
England	LOCATION	, as also
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, should have been aroused to the wonders of mountain and valley , i cataract and precipice , is a fact that one may neglect on turning over his pages , for he is I absorbed in the delight of other and newer dis - coveries .

		Light and vibration , color and value -- these may be seen alike on mountain and hay - stack ; indeed , rather more conveniently on the latter .

		One can find as much pleasure in a common
November	DATE	hill-slope with its stone walls i and its patches of wind-driven snow as Dr. |
Thomas Brown	PERSON	found in the view of Thirlmere , j which he said might have occupied the united genius of
Poussin	LOCATION	,
Claude	PERSON	, and
Salvator	PERSON	.

		One can find as much in the quiet brook that runs !

		through
Woodstock	LOCATION	meadows as in the leaping I and tumbling water that comes down at
Lodore	LOCATION	.

		The modern landscapist sees all nature trans - ' figured ; and if the modern public does not , it may well read Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's book to find out ; something about it .

		It is worth getting the two books just to compare their pictures ; and I ven - ture to say that whoever will do so will gain I something worth having in his appreciation of I modern landscape .

		`` I wish someone would explain to me this new school of
Boeklin	LOCATION	,
Childe Hassam	PERSON	, and La Touche , '' said a perplexed business man not long ago , on returning from
Pittsburg	LOCATION	.

		Mr.

Whitmanism	LOCATION	, Mr.
Eells	PERSON	was never able to see beyond it .

Oregon	LOCATION	, '' and that
Oregon	ORGANIZATION	was '' saved '' as the result of his representations in
Washington	LOCATION	and of the assistance that he rendered to the emigra - tion of
1843	DATE	.

		What new evidence does it pre - sent in support of this contention ?

		Absolutely none .

		In all essential points it is little more than a repetition of the pamphlet that Mr.
Eells	PERSON	issued in
1883	DATE	.

		The case still rests upon the pseudo-recollections of Spalding and
Geiger	PERSON	, from twenty to forty years after the event , and upon the books of Gray and
Barrows	LOCATION	, whose authority has been hopelessly discredited .

		These statements are crowded with contradictions , impossibilities , and absurdities , which it would be a work of supererogation to analyze in detail , since they were fully covered in Professor Bourne 's well-known essay .

		That Mr.
Eells	PERSON	should have continued to cling to
Spalding	LOCATION	as an authority is passing strange , since he has himself shown that the Spalding version of the story was almost wholly erroneous , and excused its vagaries on the ground that
Spalding	PERSON	was `` unbalanced '' by the hardships he suffered at the time of the Whitman massacre .

		That Mr.
Eells	PERSON	had no conception of the nature of historical evidence , and no knowledge of the source material of American history , is clear from his arguments in this book .

		It is claimed that there would be no record of the negotiation of the supposed treaty for the surrender of
Oregon	LOCATION	, because it was not consummated ; that the fact that no copy of Whitmans supposed pamphlet in support of the emigration of
1843	DATE	has ever come to light is '' no valid objection , '' and that the argument that '' evidence given from memory and written many years after the events occurred ... is not good when unaccompanied by contemporary written documents ... is of little weight . ''

		Now in this case the '' evidence given from memory '' is accompanied by an abundance of '' contemporary written documents , '' all of them entirely consistent and flatly contradicting the recollections '' written many years after the events occurred . ''

		The only parts of this evi - dence that the present book notices are Whit - man 's own letters , which it endeavors to explain by claiming that
Whitman	PERSON	omitted all reference to his larger purpose from fear of the
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	and the
Mission Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		The let - ters , taken together with those of Mrs.
Whitman	PERSON	, are too consistent to admit of any such con - struction , and Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	was too honest a man to have been guilty of the systematic eva - sion that this construction assumes .

		That Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	rendered great service to the emigra - tion of
1843	DATE	is unquestioned ; but the claim that this emigration was dear to his heart is absolutely disproved by the two letters that he wrote from
Shawnee Mission	LOCATION	.

		Much that has been written about `` saving
Oregon	LOCATION	'' has been based upon an entire mis - conception of the status of the
Oregon	LOCATION	question .

		Despite the party shibboleth of '' Fifty-four forty , or fight , '' the
United States	LOCATION	was absolutely com - mitted to the line of the 49th parallel .

		The British government was similarly committed to the line of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	river .

		The only part of
Oregon	LOCATION	that was in question was the part between the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	river and the 49th par - allel .

		Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	understood this perfectly , and wrote his brother-in-law ,
November 5,1846	DATE	, before he had heard that the boundary had been settled , and without expressing any interest in the matter : '' North of the
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, you know , is in dispute between the British and the States ; you may early learn the result . ''

		This is the only part of
Oregon	LOCATION	that was '' saved , '' and with this part Dr.
Whitman	PERSON	never had any - thing whatever to do .

		The book charges the late Professor Bourne with inaccuracy in saying that ''
Greenhow	PERSON	's exhaustive history was being distributed as a public document '' in
1843	DATE	, inasmuch as Green - how 's '' History of
Oregon	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	'' was not published until later .

		The book to which Professor Bourne referred was
Greenhow	PERSON	's '' Memoir , Historical and Political , on the North -
West Coast of North America	LOCATION	, '' which was published as a public document in
1840	DATE	, and of which the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	ordered the issue of twenty - five hundred copies '' in addition to the usual number . ''

		Professor Bourne 's statement in regard to
Fremont	LOCATION	was also absolutely correct .

		With respect to the date of Dr. White 's report as Indian Agent , he appears to have been in error .

		This is all there is of the vaunted '' mis - takes of Professor Bourne . ''

		The editors of this volume present as a front - ispiece a picture of the statue of Whitman on the Witherspoon Building in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, a replica of which in staff was unveiled last year at the
Alaska	LOCATION	-
Yukon Exposition	ORGANIZATION	.

		As there is no portrait of Whitman extant , this represen - tation of him must be largely imaginary , and therefore serves as an appropriate introduction to the pen-picture in the text .

		The purpose of the volume is indicated by the map at the end , illustrating the educational field of
Whitman College	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would contribute greatly to the reputation of this institution if its friends would abandon the unfounded pretensions that have

Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- we find a collection of the miscellanous essays contributed by him to various magazines , and which at the time of their first publication attracted unusual attention and aroused considerable discussion ; for each one of them treats of an important question in an orig - inal and forceful way .

		Tbe opening paper , on '' The Fear of Nerves , '' declares that we twentieth - century Americans are not so much victims of over - wrought nerves as victims to the belief that we ought to be or are bound to be nervously prostrated by the conditions of our complicated and breathless manner of life .

		The author reassuringly points out how much better off in all that makes for bodily and mental ease we are than our ancestors were .

		In '' The Choice of a Vocation '' and '' The Market and Psychology '' some important and little - recognized functions of psychologic science are dis - cussed .

		In '' The Standing of Scholarship '' and '' Books and Bookstores '' the viewpoint of the edu - cated German reveals itself .

		In the closing essay , on '' The World Language , '' the false assumptions and mistaken zeal of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	are incidentally held up to criticism .

		Especially significant is the German-born author 's testimony that this language-mending -- or language-marring , rather -- will greatly increase the difficulty expe - rienced by foreigners in learning our tongue .

		Among other objections to the whole deplorable business , he says : '' Even the obscuring words with a double meaning have been increased : mist is now mist and missed ; past is now past and passed ; and yet nowhere unity : wisht but not fisht , winkt but not linkt . ''

		He also effectively disposes of the conten - tion that it is our English spelling that keeps our schoolchildren one or two years behind the German schoolchildren .

		There are other polemic chapters in the book quite as good and almost as much needed as this timely protest .

		The volume is one to read with that wholeness of attention which the writer repeatedly warns us we are in danger of losing .

New England	LOCATION	to the rude West of fifty years ago is indicated by the book 's title , but also his early banishment -- self - banishment it might be called -- from the poet 's peaceful
Arcady	PERSON	, where his temperament and tastes fitted him to dwell , to the dust and turmoil of the world of affairs .

		Accompanying the letters went a few metrical compositions , which the maturer and more fastidious
John Hay	PERSON	would doubtless have blushed to own , but which , in their present setting and with
Miss Ticknor	ORGANIZATION	's graceful and appropriate words of introduction , present an interesting and not unworthy picture of the young writer 's mental and emotional state in that storm-and-stress period when he was making the feverish attempts of ardent youth to find himself .

		Five in number , the letters were written at long intervals in the years
1858	DATE	,
1859	DATE	, and
1860	DATE	.

		It is Hay the possible great poet , the possible eloquent preacher , the possible smart lawyer or man of businsss , but always Hay the idealist and dreamer , not yet entered on the path of positive achievement and assured renown , that flits uncertainly before the vision in reading these soulful outpourings of his to a sympathetic and highly-gifted friend .

		They have the deep seriousness of ingenuous youth , and the verses they enclose treat -LRB- with the natural propensity of unclouded adolescence -RRB- of the dark things of destiny and the melancholy charms of death .

		But in aptness and fluency of expression , at least , they and the letters reveal powers above the average .

		There is certainly no cause for regret , but rather much reason to be thankful , that these glimpses of what may be called the ante-Lincolnian
John Hay	PERSON	have been vouchsafed us .

		Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's chapters , fourteen in number , are short and crisp , and , with the exception of one reprinted from '' The Library Journal '' and one read at the librarians ' gathering at
Lake Minnetonka	LOCATION
two years ago	DATE	, are from the upper stratum of the cream of his '' Transcript '' articles .

		Especially timely are two chapters con - taining words of eloquent defense of `` Tom
Sawyer	PERSON	'' and ''
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, '' which '' Miss Timmins '' and certain other maiden custodians of children 's reading-rooms are trying to suppress .

		The amusing quality of Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's book must not beguile the conscientious reviewer into overlooking certain small errors , which are the more noteworthy because of that minute and painful accuracy that character - izes , or is supposed to characterize , every librarian to the manner born .

		The long-suffering printer can not be chargeable with all the lapses we have noted .

		Scott 's fiction is spoken of as '' the Waver ly novels . '' ''

		Sanatarium '' is perhaps written in an attempt to please two opposing factions , the '' sani - tarium '' and the '' sanatorium '' advocates .

		Page
1467	DATE	of a certain imaginary book is described as '' the left hand one , '' with no explanation of this unaccountable pagination .

		Finally , one is surprised that a librarian should deliberately use , in writing for publication , so loose English as occurs in the author 's reference to `` the saying of Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	about the two kinds of knowledge -- the first being when you know a thing itself , the second when you know where you can find it out . ''

		And so , with these not captious criticisms , we regretfully close '' The Library and the Librarian . ''

		The Beast represents in his narrative all that is corrupt and greedy and brutal and unscrupulous in public government and in busi - ness corporations .

Lindsey	PERSON	is the father of the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	now known to many large cities , and naturally the most important chapters of his relation have to do with his long and at last victorious fight for the rescue of
Denver	LOCATION	's boy and girl law-breakers from the revoltingly corrupt influences of the ordinary jail and prison .

		One passage , from the middle of the book , exposes the root of the evil in
Denver	LOCATION	's cor - ruption and misrule . ''

		The rule of the plutocracy in
Denver	LOCATION	was the cause of three-quarters of the crime in
Denver	LOCATION	.

		The dependent and delinquent children who came into my court came almost wholly from the homes of dependent and delinquent parents who were made such by the hopeless economic conditions of their lives ; and those conditions were made hope - less by the remorseless tyranny of wealthy men who used their lawless power to enslave and brutalize and kill their workmen . ''

		What is most impressive in these leaves from a life of heroic service is the evident fact that the writer is not a man to be bought with however high a price .

		His moral control of boys , even of the hardest cases , is also something admirable .

		The book is as interesting as it is sorely needed in this era of plutocratic and governmental wrong-doing .

		Yet in his very first chapter , on `` Books , '' after prop - erly stigmatizing the modern daily newspaper as largely responsible for the neglect of good literature , he startles us by proceeding to castigate the public library as '' another enemy of good books . ''

		Though thankful for the Bodleian Library at

Harvard University Library	ORGANIZATION	, he has no good word for our

		However , in his subsequent chapters , on literary fame , on an old-time bibliophile -LRB-
Isaac Gosset	PERSON	-RRB- , on authors and publishers , on the man of genius , and on other fruitful themes , he amply redeems himself .

		Easily the most striking portion is the ten chapters recount - ing the sixteen-thousand-mile voyage of Admiral
Rojestvensky	PERSON	's Baltic Fleet to Oriental waters , at the end of
1904	DATE	.

		In a volume published in advance of the present one ,
Captain Semenoff	ORGANIZATION	has written of the memorable fight off
Tsushima	LOCATION	,
May 22	DATE	and 28 ,
1905	DATE	, in which
Rojestvensky	ORGANIZATION	's great squadron was totally destroyed , so that the book ends at a point just prior to the battle .

		In a series of remarkably vivid chapters , however , the author depicts the forlorn hope which
Russia	LOCATION	placed in her ill-equipped and antiquated ships , and arouses in the reader a feeling of mingled admiration and pity for the heroic men , officers , and subordinates , who in the face of an impossible task never once lost their morale , or even their good humor .

		The critical historian is likely to discount more or less the sort of material contained in the volume , and obviously it can not be infallible .

		But one may expect to get from it more of the real flavor of the war-epoch than from any of the more formal histories that may subsequently be written .

		linfluencces i n u English Literature in Account on Engiuh vnth Religion '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		Company -RRB- Mr.
Edward M. Chapman	PERSON	has attempted to indicate the relation of English and American literature , mainly of the nineteenth century , to religion .

		The germ of the book was presented in two lectures delivered at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1906	DATE	, entitled , u The Influence of Religion upon English Literature During the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The book is well written , but can scarcely be said to add much of value to the growing body of criticism of Victorian literature .

		According to Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	, religion has influenced nearly every writer of impor - tance and a good many of no importance .

		He takes an exceedingly broad view of the scope of religion .

		It is much as if one were to write on English liter - ature in account with goodness , or with human nature ; or on existence in account with the cost of living .

		Take out of literature all the good qualities of men .

		which religion fosters , and all the conflicts of life , in which religion is somehow sure to be a factor , and very little is left .

		In this book religion is repeatedly confused with theology .

		But the author scarcely confines himself even to the large view of religion that he has here outlined .

		There is more or less on literary technique ; on humor , which the author connects with religion as based on confidence in the constitution of things ; and on the literary movements and tendencies of the century .

		The book thus suffers , we think , from too much scattering of shot .

		If the book was written to defend the thesis that religion has greatly influenced literature , it is superfluous : for to deny this would be absurd .

		On the other hand , as a sufficiently intensive treatment of any one author or any one phase of this great subject , it will hardly do .

		Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	carefully points out the errors of the Uni - tarians -LRB- pp. 150f. , 339 -RRB- .

		the one group that comes in for correction ; and indulges in his little joke on Renan 's H Vie de Jesus , '' which he says is B essen - tially a romance , marked by great literary charm , and occasional lapses into history . ''

		These are needless blemishes on an otherwise catholic discus - sion .

		The book is thoroughly readable , and is equipped with a good index .

		The life of a famout Queen .

		Miss
I. A. Taylor	PERSON	, to whom we are already indebted for several useful biographies of interesting queens and princesses , has recently added another volume to her series , published by the Appletons .

		This time the subject is Queen
Christina	PERSON	of
Sweden	LOCATION	.


Christina	PERSON	was the daughter of
Gustavus Adolphus	PERSON	, became queen at the age of six , resigned the crown at the age of twenty-seven , embraced the Catholic faith , and spent the remainder of her life -- thirty - five years -- in wandering from court to court , though her chief abiding-place was
Rome	LOCATION	.

		These are well-known facts , as are all the facts of
Chris	PERSON	- tina 's life ; u her life , from childhood upwards , was lived in public ; she was from first to last a centre of interest . ''

		In writing her biography the questions to consider are , therefore , scarcely of the historical sort ; they are not problems of data or interpreta - tion ; they are rather of the psychological type , questions of character and motives .

		To all these problems Miss
Taylor	PERSON	finds the solution in
Chris	LOCATION	- tina 's singular character , especially in her supreme self-confidence which would not permit her for a moment to doubt the validity of her own conclusions or the expediency of her plans and purposes .

		This faith in self is particularly apparent in her punish - ment of Monaldesco , an officer of her household who proved a traitor .


Christina	PERSON	condemned him to death , and the sentence was actually carried out , to the great disgust of the French king whose guest she was .

		In spite of her abdication , she considered herself an absolute monarch , and refused to be bound by the laws of the land where she was in temporary residence .

		Her abdication the author attributes to a variety of motives , but especially to a longing for a larger liberty than was possible at a provincial court where conventions met her at 432 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, every turn .

		The Queen 's later efforts to obtain the crowns of
Naples	LOCATION	and
Poland	LOCATION	, the author does not regard with much seriousness : the excitement of the canvas and the negotiations brought diversion and pleasure ; failure was accepted without apparent regret .

		In her attitude toward her subject ,
Miss Taylor	PERSON	is almost an ideal biographer : she is sympa - thetic but not excessively so ; she appreciates
Chris	PERSON	- tina 's strong and brilliant qualities , but makes no attempt to defend or excuse her eccentric and almost lawless behavior .

		Miss
Taylor	PERSON	closes her study of this apparently masculine woman with the startling conclusion that she was , after all , simply suffering from an exaggeration of feminine qualities . ''

		The fact remains that in gifts , virtues , deficiencies , faults , and failings , she was essentially feminine , and never more so than when she masqueraded as a man . ''

		Mr.
F. A. Simpson	PERSON	's study of '' The lf
T %	PERCENT	uncl7 > Rise of L ° ™ Napoleon '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a book that is worth while , for the reason , if for no other , that there is literally nothing in English which covers the same ground .

		But it has other claims to favor .

		Few more readable biog - raphies have ever been published .

		From the pre - fatory suggestion that his subject would have been the ideal pretender if he had only abstained from succeeding in his pretensions , to the thrust at
Bis	ORGANIZATION	- marck in the concluding sentence of the volume , ** But while the dreamer gazed on far horizons he stumbled over more than one of the obstacles at his feet , and at last fell headlong , tripped by an antag - onist who never lifted his eyes from the ground , '' the reader is charmed by an eloquence that is in no wise inconsistent with sober and accurate presenta - tion of fact .

		A quotation which supplements the prefatory estimate mentioned above may be given as completing a striking picture of
Louis	LOCATION	's character : '' The very qualities which have made him seem a prince among pretenders will hereafter -LRB- i. e. , after he assumes charge of the government -RRB- stamp him as a pretender among princes . ''

		The narrative ends with his election to the Presidency of the French Republic .

		An appendix contains a number of sug - gestive passages from his early letters , with a bibli - ography and an exhaustive index .

		Unpublished sources of information appear below the text , while all references to published data are included in the bibliography .

		The volume is generously illustrated with photographs and facsimiles from
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Around the World with a Business Man , '' by Mr.
Leander A. Bigger	PERSON	, is a work in four handsome volumes , with something like two hundred full-page illustrations .

		It is published by the
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author states that his text has '' been compiled from letters written to friends at home . ''

		He puts it forth with be - coming modesty , and claims no attempt `` at eloquence * wit , or literary excellence . ''

		We presume that it will find readers , just as the
Stoddard	PERSON	and
Holmes	PERSON	lectures in book-form found readers , and that it will stir in many a humble soul yearnings to go forth and see the things pictured or described .

		A new edition of Mill 's '' Principles of Political Economy '' is edited by Professor
W. J. Ashley	PERSON	, and published by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor supplies an elaborate introduction and a highly useful bibliographical appendix .

		If our '' new '' econ - omists would really read and digest their Mill , we should be spared many of the vagaries that now intrude upon our attention and make our study of the subject unprofitable .

		`` Boutledge 's Every Man 's Cyclopaedia '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
Arnold Villiers	PERSON	, is an inexpensive volume , moderate as to dimensions , and a veritable multum in parvo as to contents .

		It includes ten sections , of which the more important are dictionaries of biography , geography , law , synonyms , abbreviations , and '' words frequently misspelt . ''

		There are also '' Historical Allu - sions , '' '' Battles and Sieges , '' and other matters .

		On the whole , the book is a useful compendium .

		`` Skies Italian '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Methuen	LOCATION	-RRB- is described as '' a little breviary for travellers in
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Less figura - tively , it is a selection of poems about
Italy	LOCATION	, by English and American authors , edited by Miss
Ruth Shepard Phelps	PERSON	.

		There are about two hundred selections , so arranged as to follow the lines of an imaginary journey from the Alps to
Naples	LOCATION	.

		The tourist who includes this little book in his travelling equipment will make no mistake , or begrudge the few ounces of extra luggage .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' The New Inter - national Year Book '' for
1909	DATE	, edited , like the two preceding volumes , by Messrs.
Frank Moore Colby	PERSON	and
Allen Leon Churchill	ORGANIZATION	.

		The articles in English , French , and German literature are written , respectively , by Dr.
E. E. Slosson	PERSON	, Dr.
Albert Schinz	PERSON	, and
Frau Amelia	PERSON	von Ende .

		We might particularize further and at great length upon other special features of this invaluable work of up-to-date reference .

		It is an enterprise deserv - ing of the most cordial welcome and generous support .

		The handsome new '' Memorial Edition '' of Meredith , published by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, is making rapid progress .

		During the past few weeks eight volumes have appeared , containing ''
Sandra Belloni	PERSON	, '' ''
Vittoria	PERSON	, '' ''
Harry Rich	PERSON	- mond , '' ``
Rhoda Fleming	PERSON	, '' and ``
Evan Harrington	PERSON	. ''

		Each of the first three titles mentioned comprises two volumes .

		Of especial interest are the illustrations , consisting of reproductions in photogravure of portraits and homes of the author , scenes associated with the novels , and in some cases the drawings by
Keene	PERSON	and Du Maurier which appeared in the first editions .

		`` Oxford '' editions of the poets are multiplying rapidly of late , thanks to the enterprise of Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		The latest volumes are '' The Complete Works of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
W. J. Craig	PERSON	, a volume of over thirteen hundred two-columned pages ; `` The Poetical Works of
William Wordsworth	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Thomas Hutchinson	PERSON	; `` The Poetical Works of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
J. Logie Robertson	PERSON	; and `` The Poetical Works of Lord
Byron	PERSON	, '' editorially unacknowledged .

		In the smaller form of `` The World 's Classics , '' we have `` The Poems of
Alfred Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, 1830-1865 , '' edited by Dr.
F. Herbert Warren	PERSON	-- a most pocketable volume .

		THE DIAL 433 Notes .

		A new '' Uncle William '' book by Mrs.
Jennette Lee	PERSON	is announced by
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be called ' '' Happy Island , '' and will appear early this month .


Browning	PERSON	's `` Men and Women , '' in a verbatim reprint of the original edition of
1855	DATE	, is one of the latest offerings of Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	in his tasteful series of Oxford reprints .

		At the suggestion of Professor Trent , Dr.
Barnett Miller	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	undertook , about five years ago , to investigate ''
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	's Relations with l
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	. ''

		The resulting monograph , a work of much interest and value , is now published at the
Columbia L'niversity Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Owing to the death of
King Edward	ORGANIZATION	, it is announced by Messrs.
Cassell	PERSON	& Company that the new and revised edition of their Dictionary of English History , just off the press , will be temporarily withdrawn from the market .

		The publishers plan to bring the new edition quite up to the accession of
King George	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish four port - folios of plates illustrative of ''
England	LOCATION	in the Middle Ages . ''

		They are the work of Mr.
T. C. Barfield	PERSON	, and cover the four centuries from the eleventh to the four - teenth .

		They are inexpensive , and should prove of much value as an auxiliary in the work of teaching English history .

		From the
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	comes the announce - ment of their acquisition of the exclusive selling agency for the book and calendar output of
Life Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		As still further indication of their progress , this enter - prising firm also announces the unification of their interests with the publishing business of
Messrs. A. C. Armstrong & Son of New York	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the present month Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	will issue from the Doves Press the second part of his splendid edition of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faust , '' in the original text .

		Before the end of the year , Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson	PERSON	expects to have ready also Doves Press editions of
Browning	PERSON	's '' Dramatis Personse , '' and the '' Laudes Creaturarum '' of
St. Francis of Assisi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's new long novel '' Clayhanger , '' soon to be published by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is the first of a trilogy of novels dealing with the '' Five Towns . ''

		In `` The Old Wives ' Tale , '' Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	described the old spirit of the central provinces of
England	LOCATION	.

		In this forthcoming trilogy he will describe the breakdown of the old spirit by the new .

		Ex-Mayor
Charles F. Warwick	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	has just completed the biography of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	upon which he has been at work for some years , and which is to be brought out in the Fall by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a sequel to the same author 's volumes on
Mirabeau	LOCATION	,
Danton	PERSON	, and
Robespierre	LOCATION	, and will deal with the close of the French Revolution and the
First Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Almost coincident with the recent publication of
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	's `` A
Garland	LOCATION	to Sylvia '' -- a play begun while its author was a senior in
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	and not completed until
1899	DATE	-- comes the announce - ment of the enthusiastic reception accorded to his latest work '' Anti-Matrimony , '' a satire on the Ihsen school of drama which was produced a few weeks ago in
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		The press has been unanimous in its praise , one of the papers declaring that '' the play is a com - pliment to Americans on their healthy-mindedness . ''

		Under the editorship of Professor
Clarence W. Alvord	PERSON	of the
University of Hlinois , Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have planned a series of volumes intended to nar - rate the history of the development of the West , told in biography .

		Each book will be written from a care - ful study of available and original sources .

		Among the subjects of the volumes in preparation are
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	,
William Henry Harrison	PERSON	,
John Charles Fremont	PERSON	, and
Charles Michel de Langlade	PERSON	.

		A complete collection of the poems of the late
Sophie Jewett	PERSON	will be published in the autumn by Messrs.
Thomas Y. Crowell	PERSON	& Company .

		The volume will include the lyrics , sonnets , and rondeaus which have already appeared in book form ; those published more recently in different magazines ; and a number of hitherto unpublished poems .

		Among these latter is a translation of the greater part of
D'Annunzio	PERSON	's `` The Daughter of Jorio . ''

		The same firm is to publish immediately
Miss Jewett	PERSON	's last prose work , `` God 's Troubadour , '' the story of
St. Francis of Assisi	ORGANIZATION	told for children .

		We have had proof of the quality of Mr.
Jethro Bittell	PERSON	as a translator of German verse in his volume devoted to the Minnesingers , and hence are assured beforehand that his '' Contemporary German Poetry '' will give us versions of a superior sort .

		He appears to be one of the chosen in the art of turning poetry from one language into another .

		We do not know many of the voung writers upon whom he has drawn , but he makes us desire their better acquaintance .

		The little book is published by Mr.
Walter Scott	PERSON	as a volume of '' The Canterbury Poets . ''

		A complete edition of
William Penn	LOCATION	's works , long desired by those interested in the life and work of the founder of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, has been undertaken by that well-known historian of the Colonial and Revolutionary periods , Mr.
Albert Cook Myers	PERSON	, with the cordial cooperation of the Historical Society of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	as represented by a committee headed by the Hon.
Samuel W. Pennypacker	PERSON	as president , and served by Professor
John Bach Mc Master	PERSON	in the capacity of cor - responding secretary .

		A prospectus issued by Mr.
Myers	PERSON	gives , among other interesting information , the fact that '' only four meagre and antiquated editions of the collected works of
Penn	LOCATION	have been printed , all of these in
London	LOCATION	, '' at varying intervals between
1726	DATE	and
1825	DATE	.

		The proposed plan has the hearty endorse - ment of Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	, and many other scholars and writers of note .

		Messrs.
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce the preparation of '' The American Year Book , '' the first volume of which , covering the year
1910	DATE	, will appear in
February , 1911	DATE	.

		The aim of the series is to fill the need of an annual summary of events and progress -- a need which has been felt for some years by scientific , historical , literary , sociological , economic , journalistic , and other workers .

		While it will be devoted chiefly to American affairs , the most important events of foreign progress will be fully noted .

		The organization at present consists of accredited representatives or members of twenty - nine of the great national learned societies , who act as a
Supervisory Board	ORGANIZATION	, working through an
Executive Committee	ORGANIZATION	of seven , and through the Chairman of the
Board	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Board	ORGANIZATION	has selected as managing editor Mr.
S. N. D. North	PERSON	, recently Director of the
