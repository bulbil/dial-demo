		NOTES 20 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 20 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 21 THE SUMMER SHOW .

		This is the time when the question of sum - mer entertainment , or diversion , or occupation , becomes insistent , and many are the answers that are offered to more or less willing ears .

		A few fortunate people have quite definite answers of their own , and need no counsel ; the great majority , we imagine , are in different case , and approach their vacation time with very hazy notions concerning its most profitable use .

		They are chiefly impressed by the fact that it means a vacation from the irksomeness of the year 's routine , and they do not greatly care if it remain vacant of any kind of real content .

		The craving for mere rest becomes so strong as the solstice approaches that even the making of plans becomes a burden , and relaxation alone seems a satisfaction whoUy sufficient for the needs of both body and mind .

		But since we have taken the word '' vacation '' in its literal meaning , we may perhaps with equal propriety take the word '' recreation '' in the same way , and ask if there be not some better means of renew - ing the springs of energy and of restoring the lost vitality than are offered by sheer idleness .

		The wholesome work of re-creation goes on in idleness , no doubt , as it does in sleep ; but possibly its pace may be quickened and its bene - fits enhanced by taking a little thought and exercising some degree of foresight .

		One aspect of the question is suggested by the thought of
summer	DATE	reading .

		Following a some - what conventional tradition , this journal every year supplies its readers with lists of new books in the domains of popular fiction , country life , the study of nature , and the world brought to our ears by travellers ' report .

		It is well to emphasize these classes of literature in the sum - mer time , and to forbear overmuch stress upon history and science , to say nothing of such unin - viting themes as sociology and pedagogy and politics .

		Juiceless reading is what no one wants in
summer	DATE	, however strange the tastes that may have been acquired at and for other seasons of the year .

		But because the reading suit - able for
summer	DATE	excludes whole categories of books there is no reason why it should select , from the categories of which it approves , only 6 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, books of frivolous type , which make no demand upon the intelligence .

		It is to be presumed that a healthful stimulus to thought and feeling is as necessary for our weeks of play as for our months of work .

		This does not mean that we want the same kind of reading for all seasons , but it does mean that all our reading should be worth while .

		And there is one kind of reading , apt to be neglected in more strenuous times , which pre - eminently belongs to
summer	DATE	, and that is the reading of poetry .

		We hasten to add , lest the thought prove too alarming , that we do not mean all kinds of poetry , even of good poetry , for all kinds of readers .

		We should hesitate to urge '' Paradise Lost '' upon the reluctant idler , but would like to recommend the '' Faery Queene '' to his consideration ; we would not be hard - hearted enough to advise that he wrestle with '' The Ring and the Book , '' but we feel assured of his gratitude if he will follow our advice and make acquaintance with '' The Earthly Par - adise . ''

		What we started out to do , however , was to talk about
summer	DATE	shows , and not about sum - mer books .

		Summer itself is one of the greatest of aU shows -LRB- as
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	knew -RRB- ; but the word is now used in its more limited sense .

		As warm weather approaches , a curious phenom - enon is noticeable in the theatres of all our large cities .

		As by common consent , the purveyors of dramatic entertainment for the midtitude withdraw from the boards every '' attraction '' that has any claim to be called legitimate drama , and substitute a species of show that is not even fit , as someone remarked to us the other day , to be offered for the attention of convalescent lunatics .

		The vaudeville crazy-quilt and the incoherent inanity of what is styled musical comedy -LRB- although it is neither musical nor comic -RRB- constitute the only sort of fare we are likely to get in our
summer	DATE	theatres .

		Any - thing resembling a play will be sought for in vain .

		Now it is our fixed belief that only mis - guided persons will resort to the theatre at all on a hot
summer	DATE
evening	TIME	, and those who are thus aberrant of judgment or lacking in a sense of the fitness of things probably get no severer ptmishment than they deserve ; but if play - houses are to be kept open , and people are willing to enter them , it does seem a pity that some of them at least should not be doing the sort of work for which the play-house primarily exists .

		We would not exactly urge the desir - ability of
summer	DATE	productions of '' Othello '' and `` Hamlet , '' or of the plays of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, but we would make a plea for some sort of genuinely dramatic offering , the premise once granted that the boards are to be occupied at all .

		Since the only proper place to spend a warm
summer	DATE
evening	TIME	is out of doors , it follows that the ideal
summer	DATE	show should have the sky for its roof , the greensward for its stage floor , and interlacing trees for its proscenium arch .

		This is a combination not easily to be worked in connection with the drama , although such in - stances as the Shakespearian performances of Mr.
Ben Greet	PERSON	, and the recent production of '' Comus '' upon the campus of the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, will at once occur to the mind .

		Here at least is the right idea , and it has many possibilities as yet undeveloped .

		It represents the good extreme , as contrasted with the bad extreme offered by the sensational spectacle that may be witnessed in the average amusement park .

		We should imagine that English liter - ature would provide many works suitable for open-air performance besides the few that have already become somewhat hackneyed by use , and that new authors might find a promising opportunity in the composition of works ex - pressly designed for this kind of presentation .

		In all such efforts , music should play as large a part as possible , for those who have witnessed sylvan performances of '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' and '' The Tempest '' know that it is the musical accompaniment that sets the crown - ing touch of charm upon those hours of outdoor delight .

		And music , at least , we may always have on
summer	DATE	evenings ; for that needs no theatrical accessories .

		Perhaps it is ungracious to ask for more than that , for the great tone - poets have outdone all the dramatic word - mongers in portraying thought and feeling , in setting problems and solving them , in penetrat - ing to the very heart of life and revealing the secret springs of its inspiration .

		Keeping in touch with good literature , says one of the thousands of commencement orators who have of late been offering good advice to graduating classes , is the surest way to keep happy .

		Let us quote the speaker 's words more exactly and more fully , and then proceed to write them upon the table of our heart . ''

		I think , '' he says , '' it would be an excellent idea to reverse the old proverb and say , ' Be happy and you '11 be good . '

		And the surest way to keep happy is to be in touch with good literature .

		Always have some standard book near you .

		By devoting ten minutes each night to reading , I got through fourteen volumes of
Parkman	LOCATION	's history last year ; and I ca n't tell you how much benefit I derived from it . ''

		Rapid reading that must have been , surely ; but even the slow reader , like the tortoise , can reach the goal and sometimes win the prize .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL CASUAL COMMENT .

		The Bacon-Shakespeare cryptogramania long ago reached such a pitch of frenzy that its later mani - festations have ceased to surprise .

		But a new absurdity in this kind , that has appeared in a
London	LOCATION	newspaper from the pen of Mr.
John Benson	PERSON	, merits a passing smile .

		That it is nothing but a clever burlesque is more than likely ; yet one can imagine many an honest Baconian as taking the little skit for gospel truth -- and small blame to him either , the whole controversy from beginning to end having so much the hue and complexion of an elaborate piece of solemn fooling .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	professes to find , in the recent suggestion of
Portland Place	LOCATION	as the site of the proposed Shakespeare monument , a startling significance that has escaped gener ' / '' notice . ''

		It is common knowledge , '' says he , '' that tho lifelong desire of many eminent men has been to occupy a resi - dence in
Portland Place	LOCATION	.

		Such a desire has been frankly avowed in published autobiographies .

		Without any direct evidence such as I shall , with your permission , show to exist , we might surely suppose that
Shakespeare	PERSON	was no exception to the rule , and that he also looked forward to a day when his fortune would allow him to rent an eligible mansion . ''

		Now for some of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's '' direct evidence . '' ''

		Let - any one possessing a know - le3ge of simple cryptogram take down his first folio of * Hamlet ' -- if he is so unfortunate as not to possess one , he may repair to the nearest free library -- and , with a strong magnifying glass , examine the lettering of the first thirty lines of the soliloquy , ' To be or not to be . '

		He will assuredly notice , as I , to my amazement , noticed even without a magnifier , that certain letters vary , very slightly , in form from the remainder .

		And in the lines in question he will discover that the peculiar letters , arranged consecutively , make up the striking line : < ■ I would that I might live in
Portland Place	LOCATION	. '

		Thus we find in a passage which every man and woman of the least education has learned to lisp at the mother 's knee the chief ambition of the dramatist 's life . ''

		Confirma ^ tory passages , not in cipher , are found in the same play ; as in Act i. .

		Scene 4 : `` The very place puts toys of desperation , without more motive , into every brain ; '' and , in Act iv. , Scene 1 : '' Bestow this place on us a little while . ''

		This excellent fooling has elicited from Professor
Rolfe	PERSON	a pleasant rejoinder , declaring his in - ability to distinguish with certainty seriousness from mockery in the many astonishing '' discoveries '' made by the cryptogram-hunters , but closing with the per - tinent observation that
Portland	LOCATION	Place was , of course , unknown because non-existent in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's day , this whole district of modern
London	LOCATION	being then far outside the city limits and almost uninhabited .

		• `` ■ The purity of American speech has again received high praise from an eminent authority .

		Professor
Alois Brandl	PERSON	, second to none in
Germany	LOCATION	on the subject of English literature and the English language , condemns the cockney accent that offends his ear in
John Ball	PERSON	's island , and rates our American speech as no whit inferior -LRB- although he denies that he ever said it was superior -RRB- to the English of our cousins across the water .

		He even encourages us to hope that the dreadful Yankee `` twang '' will ere long be a memory and nothing more ; he thinks it is disappearing , overcome and corrected by our system of public education .

		This German philologist has conversed with both English and American students in German universities , and has visited this country and listened to thirty-five of our public speakers , the most un-English of whom in pronunciation he found to be Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, who is by birth neither American nor English , but Scotch .

		Dr.
Brandl	PERSON	was consulted by the Prussian minister of education with reference to the proposed exchange of German and American college instructors ; and though the purity of American English was called in question by the consultant , the other 's advice prevailed , and young Prussians are now to drink imstinted draughts from American wells of English undefiled .

		Another high authority , and an English - man too , is said to agree with the German professor on this disputed question .

		We refer to Professor
Skeat	PERSON	, the occupant of the chair of Anglo-Saxon at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, who is quoted as commending the instruction given in this coimtry in English literature and language , sub - jects that he finds too often neglected in the schools and universities of his own land .

		But all of this is sub - ject for interminable and seldom very profitable debate .

		On reading in bed many eulogies have been spoken and written , and also many wise and salutary and less eulogistic observations have been made .


Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	and
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	and other men not so famous have enjoyed the reading of a good book in a good bed at a scandalously late hour of the
night	TIME	-LRB- or morning -RRB- , and to all such partakers in this lazy luxury the words of a current medical journal will be welcome : '' Certain people find that their worries accumulate in their brains after bedtime ; their nerves are at high ten - sion and their minds are actively at work trying to solve problems that should have been left behind in the city .

		Going to bed with the brain in such a state means that with nothing to distract the thoughts , hearing nothing and seeing nothing in the darkness , imagination has full sway , and hours of wakefulness may be the result .

		Such a man , we think , wUl find half an hour 's reading in bed a great help .

		With careful attention paid to the quality and position of the light , so that without flickering it shines over the shoulder and directly on to the page , the much maligned habit of reading in bed has sometimes a very beneficial effect on a tired and overwakeful brain . ''

		So far so good ; but your true bed-reader , your impas - sioned lector in lectulo , will never consent to close his book at the end of half an hour ; he has just got well started and begun thoroughly to enjoy himself , the world for - getting , by the world forgot , in that brief space of time .

		• • • Duplicate fiction for hire , in public libraries , to meet the excessive demand for the very latest novels , was recently referred to by us , in terms of too little accuracy , as being still in its tentative stage .

		Librarian Lummis , of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, in his latest annual report , speaks of this rental department as having originated at
St. Louis	LOCATION	'' more than a decade ago , '' and he gives some interesting results of his own ten months ' trial of the same system .

		The
Los Angeles	LOCATION	charge is
five cents	MONEY	a week , with a five-cent fine for each day of detention afterward . ''

		This collection , '' he writes , '' started with 467 volumes imder 74 titles .

		It now has 480 volumes under 100 titles .

		The system has been largely self - regulating as to the number of volumes of a popular novel to be bought .

		It has given for the first time adequate service to that considerable class of the public who desire to keep posted on current fiction .

		It has done this without working any injustice whatsoever to the other patrons of the library .

		In the ten and a half months since its installation , this duplicate list has cir - THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, culated over 20,000 issues and has received in cash
$ 179.20	MONEY	in fines and
$ 831.80	MONEY	in dues .

		Its net cost has been
$ 598.09	MONEY	.

		Roughly speaking , it has paid for itself twice over . ''

		A further result , cheering or depressing according to the point of view , is duly recorded : the circulation of fiction , under the new system , has been increased by more than ten per cent in less than a year .

		• • • The museum as an adjunct to the library is of recent development , but its uses and possibilities are too manifest to need any demonstration on our part .

		Among other examples , we remember the public library at
Methuen	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, as a most happy commingling of books and some of the things they tell about .

		The current issue of the ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin , '' published by the
Wisconsin Free Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, contains among other articles of interest a contribution from Dr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	, of the
State Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, on '' Local Public Museums in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	. ''

		A picture of a
New England	LOCATION	kitchen in the
State Historical Museum	ORGANIZATION	serves as an ocular proof of the value of right arrangement and grouping in the display of curiosities .

		We learn from Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's article that `` existing
Wisconsin	LOCATION	library laws make no specific provision for a museum in connection with the municipal library , as is the case in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless , at
Oshkosh	ORGANIZATION	the public library has established within its building a most creditable museum , and there are small collections displayed in several other of the city libraries in the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		All honor to
Oshkosh	ORGANIZATION	as a leader in this move - ment !

		Following Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's article are condensed reports from representative local museums in connection with
Wisconsin	LOCATION	public libraries .

		• • • The decadence of the old-time `` leader '' has been noted and regretted in
London	LOCATION	journalism .

		The scholarly , deliberately-written , authoritative editorial is giving place to the flashy , sensational , truth-distorting and prejudice-breeding news article , headed , more Americano , with gigantic capitals and printed with a '' display '' of anything but reticence and modesty .

		Writers of the first rank , men of wide information and mature judgment , are now seldom engaged as leader - writers for the
London	LOCATION	dailies , but all available resources go to increase the prominence and the popular influence and attractiveness of the heavily-headlined first page .

		Must we , lamenting this change , accept it as inevitable and sadly admit that the stately grace and the Uterary charm of a journalism that is dead will never come back to us ?

		.

		• > The minor morals of men of letters -- that is , their manners in social intercourse -- are by common consent regarded as less polished and urbane than might be desired .

		We seem to have here a curious meeting of extremes , the literate and illiterate displaying a certain boorishness in common , in some instances at least .

		Mr.
Oscar Fay Adams	PERSON	, whose acquaintance with literary persons qualifies him to speak with some authority , has brought together in a newspaper article a few amusing examples of defective eoiu-tesy on the part of authors .

		A great writer and one less great were once thrown in company at a social function , when it occurred to the lesser celebrity that , as he had never been introduced to his more famous fellow-author , there could be no harm in introducing himself . ''

		I believe , Mr.
M	PERSON	, '' said he , '' that we have never met before . '' ''

		No , '' was the frigid rejoinder , '' we never have , and if I can have my wish in the matter we shall never meet again .

		Good morning , sir . ''

		With which the interview came to an abrupt close .

		At a meeting of antiquaries and other learned men it fell to the lot of
Froude	PERSON	, as chairman , to present his implacable foe .

		Freeman , to the audience ; which he thus did in ominously honeyed tones : '' It now gives me great pleasure to introduce to you one who , in his own presence , so well illustrates the savage customs of our remote ancestors . ''

		One can hardly believe this of the long-suffering and high - minded
Froude	PERSON	; but the provocation was certainly great .

		In general , though surely not in the last exam - ple , is it not more often shyness than ill-nature that makes bookworms and dreamers less courteous of manner than society folk ?

		And in cases of positive rudeness , is it not often the fault of the literary person 's nimbleness of wit , which makes the temptation to be cutting and sarcastic too strong to be resisted ?

		It is a subject for study and discussion , and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has by no means exhausted it .

		Songs of the opening
summer	DATE	have been much in evidence of late in the newspapers of the northern hemi - sphere .

		Has any reader of them , or any scornful skipper of them , stopped to think how minute a fraction of all the
spring	DATE	poetry written and submitted for pub - lication these sufficiently niunerous lays of the season constitute ?

		A notion of the excess of supply over demand might have been gained by the readers of a recent
Sunday	DATE	supplement to a
Cleveland	LOCATION	paper , which generously published an entire page of this volunteer verse , which we doubt not the proud authors were glad enough to see in print at no larger remuneration than
$ 0.00	MONEY	per nonpareil line .

		A contemporary takes occa - sion to hail with joy this editorial indulgence of budding poetic genius , and to remark that nothing has given it more solid satisfaction since the days of
Georgia	LOCATION	's premier poet , the late lamented
J. Gordon Coogler	PERSON	, who gave to the world the matchless coupliet : '' The books in the South are growing fewer -- She never was much on literature . ''

		• • • Chaucer the man has made himself loved by many readers because he so simply and naturally reveals his human nature in his writings .

		A chance passage from
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, reprinted in Mr.
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	's newly - issued volume on ''
Coleridge	PERSON	's Literary Criticism , '' is suggestive : '' I take imceasing delight in
Chaucer	LOCATION	.

		His manly cheerfulness is especially delicious to me in my old age .

		How exquisitely tender he is , and yet how perfectly free from the least touch of sickly melancholy or morbid drooping !

		The sympathy of the poet with the subjects of his poetry is particularly remarkable in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	and Chaucer ; but what the first effects by a strong act of imagination and mental metamorphosis , the last does without any effort , merely by the inborn kindly joyousness of his nature .

		How well we seem to know Chaucer !

		How absolutely nothing do we know of Shakespeare ! ''

		Most of us would have put the last clause far less strongly , but the distinction is worth noting ...
Coppee	ORGANIZATION	's felicitous choice of words and his dexterity in weaving them into a beautiful pattern con - stituted not the least of his merits as a literary artist .

		Now that he is taken from us , many will recall , even though they may have read but few of his writings , the grace and charm of his style , and the air of simple truth that hangs about his imaginative creations . ''

		Unlike others , '' says a fellow-countryman of his in appraising
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL his work , '' he was not led by pride or error to cut the bridges between himself and the multitude .

		Faithful to his antecedents , faithful to himself , he remained faith - ful to the crowd whom like memories and analogous cir - cumstances had shaped as they had shaped him .

		His genius did not separate him from the men of his time and his country ; he sang their songs so well that they listened with an unfeigned sympathy ... Little clerks , little shopkeepers , little earners of little incomes , with only an occasional
Sunday	DATE	for pleasure , -- these were the simple heroes of his epics .

		He knew them through and through ; he had an affectionate admiration for their patience , a sort of compassion for their predestined mediocrity . ''

		This is better praise than any commen - dation of his literary style , admirable though that style is recognized , even by the foreign reader , to have been .

		`` The corrosive press '' is a stronger and more vividly descriptive term than '' yellow journalism '' -- partly because it is newer .

		If it is taken up and used , it will before long lose its biting quality ; but for the present let us give due credit to a
London	LOCATION	preacher , the Rev. Dr.
Horton	PERSON	, who has so aptly used it in deploring the vicious tendencies of the present-day newspaper .

		Of course he , as well as we , would not forget the hon - orable exceptions .

		At a public meeting called together by him in his church at
Hampstead	LOCATION	, and unanimous in condemning '' the corrosive press , '' Dr.
Horton	PERSON	read an astounding proposal addressed by a certain newspaper editor to a distinguished minister of religion , inviting the latter to assist in commercially exploiting a young girl preacher of extraordinary '' drawing '' qualities , and offering him half the gate-money .

		Doubtless these bald terms were not used by the diplomatic editor , but the substance of the letter was , to put it mildly , an affront to the ministerial cloth .

		• • • Posthumous fame in literature butters no par - snips in the matter-of-fact present .

		This prosaic truth seems to have been recognized by a novelist still living and writing , in his ready reply to a talkative lady sitting next to him at dinner and boring him , we may imagine , with her prattle on the immortality of certain books whose authors have long been dead .

		The novelist was Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	, and when the lady at last asked him whether he had written anything that would live after he had gone , he made answer : '' Madam , what I am trying to do is to write something that will enable me to live while I am here . ''

		Were not almost all the books that have achieved immortality written under an impulse astonishingly similar to that acknowledged by the author of '' Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	'' ?

		• • • The finest line of poetry , like the ten or the hundred best books , can not be the same to all persons .

		In some recent newspaper discussion of the matter , the Wordsworthian line , '' The light that never was on sea or land , '' has been cited as especially pleasing , and cer - tainly the frequency with which it is quoted proves it to be a favorite .

		For the perfect expression of the poet 's thought , some of Gray 's well-polished lines are excellent .

		Who can wake in these early
summer	DATE	morn - ings without finding himself listening to '' the breezy call of incense-breathing morn '' ?

		Or who , in his evening walks -LRB- this is written in the full of the
June	DATE	moon -RRB- , can fail to recall
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's wonderful line , '' How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank '' ?

		In moments of unfulfilled longing , of sad-sweet melan - choly , how often there comes to mind that other wonderful line , '' Absent thee from felicity awhile . ''

		And when the irony of life and the inexorableness of fate overcome us , what line better fits the mood than
Emerson	PERSON	's mystic utterance , '' When me they fly , I am the wings '' ?

		Lowell 's praise of this for its pregnancy of meaning is well known .

		There is no one finest line , and never can be ; so let us rejoice in the many finest lines quoted for our approval by the champions of the various great poets of all ages and all coimtries .

		Seafaring libraries may not be so many in number or so expertly selected and managed as the land-travel - ling kind that go thither and yon by rail and stagecoach , under the favoring auspices of the A. L. A .

		But the book-chests that sail the briny deep , stowed in the f oc ` sle by some kind agent or patron of the
Seamen 's Friend Society	ORGANIZATION	, and beguiling the tedium of many an off-watch for the roving
Jack Tar	PERSON	, number into the thousands ; indeed , it is claimed that the records of the above-named society show that 25,742 such collections of books for sea service have been sent out since
1859	DATE	, that 618,400 volumes have been read by 442,230 sailors , while the
United States	LOCATION	navy has record of 39,415 books read by 129,315 men in its pay and manning its ships .

		It is curious that with one exception -- '' Two Years Before the Mast '' -- the sea story of the bookstall and the public library is severely let alone by those whose life is on the ocean wave .

		Tales of land adventure and books of history and biography are studiously thumbed , as are also the novels of
Dickens	PERSON	and the poems of
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		An editio princeps of Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	's book , '' Science and Health , '' was one of the items in the late auction sale , at
New York	LOCATION	, of the library of Mr.
Edward H. Lowe	PERSON	, of
London	LOCATION	; and it brought the astonishing price of one hundred and
fourteen dollars	MONEY	.

		At the same sale the first collected edition of
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	went for one hundred and
two dollars	MONEY	.

		Mrs.
Eddy	PERSON	's magnum opus was published , in its first edition , in
1875	DATE	;
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	's collected writings , edited by
James Shirley	PERSON	, were printed in
London	LOCATION	in
1647	DATE	.

		For at least two centuries and a quarter the English - speaking world read and enjoyed
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	without the faintest premonition of the mar - vels to be revealed in '' Science and Health , with a Key to the Scriptures . ''

		And now , even thus heavily handi - capped , the latter work wins with a good lead as an auction-room record-maker .

		• • • The public library and municipal reform are not necessarily suggestive of each other to most minds ; but that the library can intelligently serve the cause of reform in city government has occurred to at least one librarian -- Mr.
Purd B. Wright	PERSON	, of the St.
Joseph	PERSON	-LRB-
Mo.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library .

		In his Eighteenth Annual Re - port he says , among other interesting things : '' Not a little attention has been given the collection of city charters in an effort to make the library of assistance in the matter of municipal legislation now before the people , and the collection includes the laws governing the progressive cities of the country . ''

		Bureaus of leg - islative reference are coming into being in various parts of the coimtry , the excellent one at
Baltimore	LOCATION	, which was noticed in some detail by us not long ago , being one of the foremost ; and the establishment of such bureaus seems to fall well within the legitimate activ - ities of our larger public libraries .

Mtia	ORGANIZATION	` Maahs , The New Life of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		* With the publication of the voluminous and exceedingly frank Autobiography of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	it might have been held that all the particulars concerning him which were of im - portance to posterity had been abundantly furnished .

		A smaller and more objective treat - ment of Spencer 's life and works was subse - quently written by Professor
J. A. Thomson	PERSON	-- a work of value from every point of view , and certain to be read by multitudes who have neither the time nor the courage to attack the Autobiography .

		The announcement of a new '' Life and Letters , '' in two rather large vol - umes , naturally raised the question whether really valuable new material could be found , to use up so much printer 's ink .

		The answer to this question will no doubt differ according to the bias of the reader ; but there will be many , in addition to the present reviewer , who are able to spend many hours over the book with equal pleasure and profit .

		Spencer him - self desired that the Autobiography should not be the sole authoritative source of information concerning his life , and inserted in his will a paragraph requesting Dr.
David Duncan	PERSON	to prepare a biography '' in one volume of mod - erate size . ''

		Dr.
Duncan	PERSON	had been his secre - tary and assistant , and was in every way well qualified for the undertaking , which so ' grew under his hand as to far exceed the moderate limits indicated by his instructions .

		The Auto - biography covers only sixty-two years of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's life , so that the new work reaUy con - stitutes the only authoritative record of the re - maining twenty-one years .

		The matter relating to the earlier periods is designed to duplicate the AutobiogTaphy as little as possible , and by means of numerous original documents it sup - plements , and in some cases even corrects , the statements given in the earlier work .

		At the end of the second volume are two appendices , written by Spencer himself , but not previously published .

		The first is called '' Physical Traits and Some Sequences '' ; the second , much longer and more important , '' The Filiation of Ideas . ''

		The latter essay consists of a history and analysis of
Spencer	PERSON	's intellectual development ; and , as he says in a prefatory note , may also '' serve as a sketch plan of the * LiFK AND Letters op

		Synthetic Philosophy . ''

		It may be permissible to quote a number of illustrative sentences . ''

		The events of childhood and boyhood , narrated elsewhere , indicate to how small an extent authority swayed me .

		The disobedience , so perpetually com - plained of , was the correlative of irreverence for gov - erning agencies .

		This natural trait operated throughout life , tending to make me pay little attention to the established opinion on any matter which came up for judgment , and tending to leave me perfectly free to inquire without restraint ... Another trait , not thus far named , and which I inherited from my father , was a dominant ideality , showing itself in a love of per - fection .

		In him this love was so strong that it became a hindrance .

		He could not let a thing alone as being finished .

		With me the desire to make work better , though pronounced , has not gone to that excess ... A general result of these natural traits and this kind of culture was an attitude of detachment ... But I must not forget another trait of nature , -- a relative liking for thought in contrast with a relative aversion to action ... -LSB- In ' Social Statics ' -RSB- there is no invoking of authorities .

		A few references , mostly dissentient , are made to ethical and political writers whose well-knowu doctrines I had gathered in the course of miscellaneous reading -- not from their books ; for I never could read books the cardinal principles of which I rejected .

		The course pursued in this case as in others was to go back to the facts as presented in human conduct and society , and draw inferences direct from them ... -LSB- From 1852 -RSB- onwards the evolutionary interpretation of things in general became habitual , and manifested itself in curious ways .

		One would not have expected to find it in an essay on ' The Philosophy of Style ' ; but at the close of that essay , written in
1852	DATE	, the truth that progress in style is from uniformity to multiformity -- from a more homogeneous to a more heterogeneous form -- finds expression ... Up to -LSB- the time of read - ing Mill 's Lofficl , thinking with me had been mainly concrete in character , but now it assumed an abstract character ; and thereafter the abstract and the concrete went hand in hand , as the inductive and the deductive were already doing ... During a walk one fine Sun - day morning -LRB- or perhaps it may have been New Year 's Day -RRB- in the Christmas of 1857-8 , I happened to stand by the side of a pool along which a gentle breeze was bringing small waves to the shore at my feet .

		While watching these undulations I was led to think of other undulations -- other rhythms ; and probably , as my man - ner was , remembered extreme cases -- the imdulations of the ether , and the rises and falls in the prices of money , shares , and commodities .

		In the course of the walk arose the inquiry -- Is not the rhythm of motion imiversal ?

		and the answer soon reached was -- Yes . ''

		The incident of the pool illustrates a trait of Spencer 's which has been misunderstood in some quarters .

		Because he made very few original observations in science , and was not in the ordinary sense a scientific investigator , there has been a tendency to class him with the com - pilers rather than with the researchers .

		This tendency is likely to increase , for the reason that aU can perceive his immense accumidation of evidence , while few are willing and able to follow the operations of his mind .

		Many of
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 his conclusions are now so generally diffused as to have become commonplace , leading to criti - cism resembling that of the man who complained that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays were so largely made up of familiar quotations .

		On the other hand , his mistakes stand out as more uniquely his , while his failings become material for gossip , the net result being an appreciable injustice .

		In any attempt to estimate
Spencer	PERSON	's position in the history of thought , it must be remem - bered that in the nineteenth century there existed an opportunity which was in many ways unique .

		The hold of ancient dogma was loosing , and the idea of evolution was slowly coming to the front .

		Academic philosophers -LRB- as even to this day -RRB- were bound to ancient traditions and were unable to frame a scheme of things in harmony with the results of modern science .

		Scientific men were too busy with their own special researches to engage in any - thing which might be termed philosophy .

		Clearly , there was needed a man of great ability and industry , who should regard all known phenomena as materials for building up a mod - ern and harmonious , system of thought .

		Such a man , however , must have also great independ - ence ; he must treat his materials in a strictly scientific manner , exactly as the ordinary inves - tigator does , or tries to do , with the smaller details within his scope .


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	had all these qualifications , and hence was able to render an extraordinary service .

		On the other hand , every part of his work necessarily reflects the state of knowledge existing in his day , and in consequence the portions which will have permanent value , other than historic , are no doubt comparatively fcAv .

		In
Spencer	PERSON	's earlier days higher education was not nearly so general as it now is , and no doubt a considerable measure of his peculiar efficiency might have been destroyed by a reg - ular academic course .

		A world full of men as independent as
Spencer	PERSON	would probably be a difficult place to live in ; but it is certainly true that from time to time there is urgent need for just such men .

		It is a somewhat alarming thought , that the Universities may eventually succeed -LRB- as the Church did in former ages -RRB- in enlisting practically aU the best budding intel - lect of the times , and depriving it of the high - est measure of originality by processes which may be perhaps wholly advantageous to the average individual .

		Danger of this sort is inherent in all extensive forms of organization , and while recognizing the advantages of the great institutions we should not lose sight of the fact that a price is paid for the gain -- just as
William Morris	PERSON	used to say about machine - made goods .

		The modern drift toward collectivism is wel - comed by the present writer .

		Science itself shows that a system of world-wide cooperation , without irksome tyranny , is perfectly possible .

		Nevertheless ,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's stand for in - dividualism , softened and modified by the haze of later experiences , will always possess a high value as representing at least one important aspect of things . ''

		Spencer , indeed , in his late years sadly took note of movements apparently in contradiction to the leading principles of his doctrines ; and here I may recall a con - versation within a week of his death between him and a friend * who had once been wholly with him , but had latterly leant to Collectivist action . '

		We have been separated , ' said
Spencer	PERSON	, ' but if we have been moving along different lines , I know we have both been moving to the same end . ' '

		Yes , ' she replied -- it was a woman who showed that divergence of opinion could not detach her from offices of tenderness and of love -- ' and it may be that in time some other method of attacking the great problem will be adopted , which will be neither wholly yours nor wholly ours . ' '

		Yes , it may be , ' said
Spencer	PERSON	, thus revealing in the last week of his life a mind open to receive new suggestions and to accept new proposals of change . ''

		A Study of a Great ILiITerarx Period .

		* The great thought of an age may be absorbed into the thought of the ages that follow ; a great form can never be so absorbed .

		You may come upon the thought again and again , in new shapes and applications ; to appreciate the great form , you must go back to its period and take it practi - cally as it was given to the world .

		Aristotle , for instance , appears and reappears in philosophy for two thousand years ; while - lEschylus , broadly speaking , is to be had only in Greek drama .

		If the form is worth studying and enjoying -- and every great form is -- it must be taken in rela - tion to the time that produces it .

		Our own noblest literary heritage , the drama of the age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, is coming back into significance again , and the race from which came the greatest concerted utterance of all literature seems almost ready to give that utter - ance a true second hearing .

		It is going to be • Elizabethan Drama : 1558-1642 .

		A History of the Drama in
England	LOCATION	from the
Accession of Queen Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	to the Clos - ing ' of the Theatres .

		To which is prefixed a R6sum6 of the
Earlier Drama	ORGANIZATION	from its Beginnings .

		By
Felix B. Schelling	PERSON	, Professor in the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		12 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, eminently worth our while to listen , for the epoch provides an almost inexhaustible store of wholesome enjoyment , and a knowledge of its form will be of very great benefit to a time -- our own -- that is about to witness a revival of drama that will be literary , not in the sense of being bookish , but in the sense of being artistic and real .

		Whatever serves , then , to bring us closer to Elizabethan drama is welcome , and doubly welcome , if it is comprehensive and illuminating , showing the subject in many clear lights .

		Doubly welcome , therefore , is Professor ScheUing 's magnum opus in this field .

		The book is the result of long , careful , and sympathetic study .

		Marked literary feeling , catholicity of taste , and , best of all , a true sense of perspective -LRB- whose absence is the first infirm - ity of scholarly minds -RRB- , are among the author 's endowments .

		There are limitations in the work , some obvious , some not immediately apparent ; but no work covering so large a field can be without its limitations , and no work that essays to cover this particular field has so few .

		In view of much painstaking yet often near-sighted German investigation of this period , it is in no small degree provocative of national pride to realize that we have here a well-proportioned American book that may rightly rank with Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	's '' Mediaeval Stage , '' and serve as a continuation of that admirable achievement .

		Professor ScheUing 's book is written to stand the test of scholarship ; and although many of the special opinions expressed in the twelve hundred pages will doubtless receive correction in the future , the book will bear the general test .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	very clearly marks out the boundaries of his task .

		This is a history of Elizabethan drama , -- a wider subject than Elizabethan dramatic literature , and a much wider one than Elizabethan dramatic poetry , the author rightly holding that a study of master - pieces only is bound to break down as an explan - ation of a great period .

		This great period , roughly denominated Elizabethan , includes , in the author 's usage , more than the precise years of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's reign , and , beginning nominally with her accession in
1558	DATE	-LRB- in reality we are given also a fairly complete sketch of the develop - ment of the miracles , moralities , and interludes -RRB- , continues to the suppression of the theatres two score of years after the great queen 's death .

		Whatever objections there may be to the name Elizabethan for the period , there can be no objection to the inclusion of practically a cen - tury as the proper historical epoch to deal with .

		On the other hand , having stated as his theme the history of the whole dramatic production of the given time , the author excludes from his work purely aesthetic and technical considera - tions of dramatic form , the tracing of sources , specifically theatrical history , and biographical matter , save when these various things are in - volved in the general theme .

		The properly elaborate table of contents shows the character of the book .

		It is made up of chapters on subjects like these :
Early Dramas of School and Court	ORGANIZATION	, the New Romantic Drama ,
National Historical Drama	ORGANIZATION	, Domestic Drama , Romantic Comedy , Comedy of Humors ,
Roman	PERSON	- tic Tragedy , Classical Myth and Story , the
Masque	ORGANIZATION	, the Pastoral ,
Decadent Romance	ORGANIZATION	.

		In other words , the entire subject is parcelled out into its natural divisions , and each one of these divisions is fully treated by itself , each species being carried from its beginning to its conclu - sion .

		Inasmuch as the work is primarily a study of a great type , and but secondarily a study of authors , the authors themselves are not treated separately .

		They do not lose by it ; on the contrary , their actual merits are more appar - ent when seen comparatively .

		So , too , of course , are their defects ; but a period is before us where the men are large enough to risk having their defects brought into the field , providing their virtues are made equally obvious .

		It may make some readers open their eyes not to find a single chapter devoted to Shake - speare , and yet this book will give its readers a better notion of Shakespeare than almost any volume that can be named .

		For if the master playwright does not preempt a single chapter , he enters into many chapters , and we see his work not as an isolated phenomenon but as an organic part of a great whole .

		As each phase of the whole epoch is discussed , the relation of each individual playwright to that phase is made clear , and thus varied activity and special pre - eminence receive their actual due , other drama - tists as well as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	standing out from the rank and file of the average , save that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is thus demonstrably more versatile , obviously more outstanding .

		There is no feature of the book that is better than this admirable planning ; for while treat - ing the whole of a given author at one time undeniably gives us a more unified notion of that author as an individual , the present way gives much the best idea of period and workman in their actual relationship .

		Imagine the history of a great political movement told by a series of outlines of the complete work of each statesman who was a factor , and then in contrast imagine
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 the same movement treated as an organic de - velopment , stage by stage , with each partici - pant 's share clearly indicated in its proper place .

		The difference between the wrong way and the right way , historically , is no greater than the difference between the old way and our present author 's way .

		As is the case with many another valid plan , one of the wonders is that no one should have hit on it before .

		The author 's style is direct and simple ; his criticism is definite instead of metaphorical .

		The latter virtue is worthy of special praise , for the Elizabethan writers seem particularly to tempt their sympathetic critics to more or less vivid figures of speech in lieu of accurate state - ment .

		There is a place , of course , for such figurative criticism ; but the place , broadly speaking , is in volumes of poetry .

		Swinburne 's striking sonnets on Elizabethan dramatists , for instance , successfully say nearly all that is needed in that kind .

		The absence of superflu - ous metaphor in Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's prose will not mean to a discerning reader absence of live - liness ; there is much quiet humor , unobtru - sively put , -- as when the all-sufficient comment is made on
John Stock	ORGANIZATION	wood that in
1678	DATE	he inveighed against certain theatres , '' thus giving us an early mention of those playhouses . ''

		Fur - ther , if our author eschews sentimentality , he does not feel in scholarship bound to repress real feeling .

		The underlying temper of his criticism appears in a remark on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's dominant interest in character rather than in structure : '' How trivial seem our paltry labelings : Cymheline ,
1609	DATE	, a belated specimen of the chronicle history in which a romantic story of Italian origin usurps an undue share of a plot otherwise of English pseudo - historical original !

		Wholly negligible seem these little pickings of small scholarship in view of the single , wholesome , dominating influence of that exquisite pic - ture of truest and sweetest womanhood ,
Imogen	PERSON	. ''

		Note , however , that this is said by a man who has mastered details ; not by one who has scorned the little pickings without being acquainted with them .

		Yet it must be freely admitted that much indulgence even in real sentiment would be dangerous ; for instance , the author has certainly left safe ground when he speaks of transubstantiation as '' a dramatic motive of the utmost tragic efficacy '' ; when in an utterly different field he appraises
Jonson	PERSON	's comedy by a too narrowly aesthetic standard ; and when in an obiter dictum he speaks of modem drama as losing itself `` in the thirsty realistic sands of Ibsen . ''

		The necessary limits of a general review pre - clude reference to more than a few of the several score of passages marked for favorable comment , and the dozen or so noted for sharp objection .

		It is good to find Professor
Schelling	PERSON	frankly accepting the term '' miracle '' instead of '' mystery '' -LRB- a pedantry in English -RRB- , reject - ing definitely the '' alternation theory '' of Elizabethan staging , and refusing to be led into the intricacies of attempted solution of col - laboration in dramatic authorship .

		For objec - tions , one will serve : in commenting on
Webster	PERSON	's '' Duchess of Malfy , '' Professor
Schelling	PERSON	notes that the discovery , by a recent American scholar , of a reference to
Concini	ORGANIZATION	,
1617	DATE	, dates the play '' once for all '' -LRB- a term , by the way , that is used too frequently and too hastily in the book -RRB- .

		The supposed allusion was pointed out twelve years ago by an English scholar , Mr.
C Vaughan	PERSON	.

		But even if correct , a single reference , which might easily have been interpolated at a revival of the play , can not possibly date a whole play whose tone otherwise indicates a date prior to
Concini	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		Of unusual value are the splendidly copious Bibliographical Essay , and the practically ex - haustive list of plays written , acted , or published between
1558	DATE	and
1642	DATE	.

		This list , however , could be made more useful by having a page cross-reference to the bibliography , which is arranged by species and calls for a thumbing over of a number of pages before the play within the species is found .

		The book is an important one , -- a notable contribution to American scholarship .

		But it is a book for the intelligent layman as well as for the scholar , and its reader will be spurred on to wider reading in one of the most fascinating fields of literature .


Martin W. Sampson	PERSON	.

		The PsYCHOiiOGY or
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Mr.
Bentley	PERSON	, the author of this `` Study in Social Pressures '' which he calls '' The Process of Government , '' explains in the first part of his book that it is intended as a protest against attempts to explain social phenomena by treat - ing them as the results of prevalent '' feelings '' or '' ideas , '' so as to imply a '' soul-stuff '' as the underlying cause .

		This part of the book is practically devoted to the contention that by falling victims to this '' soul-stuff '' error a large number of most eminent writers have reduced portions of their work to absurdity .

		Mr.
Bentley	PERSON	is right in saying , as sociologists *

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, have said before , that prevalent '' feelings '' and '' ideas '' are not entities apart from the social reality , causing it to be what it is , but are the very essence of that reality .

		Yet he is wrong whenever he denies that particular prevalent feelings and ideas have causal significance in explaining the social reality , for that is to deny that social activities condition each other .

		We must indeed see that every given '' feeling '' is an activity in which there is more or less idea , and every prevalent `` idea '' an activity in which there is more or less feeling .

		It is by a kind of meton - ymy that we call any prevalent activity a '' feel - ing '' or an '' idea , '' naming it by its most promi - nent feature .

		It is true that no single phase or feature of social activity should be made the mother of the social realities .

		The biologically derived capacities of men , and the environing physical nature and human activities , are all causal conditions , and terms in social explana - tion .

		Interest or attention is a name for the fact of fruitful union between capacity and en - vironment .

		There is good ground for protest against the common resort to interests and motives as the '' social forces . ''

		Such a protest was earlier made by the present reviewer , who has insisted that the sociologist has no more need for any '' social force , '' in addition to the ohserv - ahle factors in causation , than the biologist has for a vital force .

		Mr.
Bentley	PERSON	is right in saying that scientific explanation should not rest on any implication of a causal '' soul-stuff '' assumed to underlie the activities observed .

		By his revul - sion against the '' soul-stuff '' assumption he is made to go too far toward identifying social activity with overt muscle-motion , whUe slight - ing activity as it is inferred to exist for con - sciousness ; and the condemnation which he heaps upon other writers is based upon quota - tions , at least a part of which had for their authors , and naturally convey to their readers , a meaning to which his objections do not apply .

		The second part of the book is more exten - sive , more readable , and more useftd than the introductory criticisms .

		In making the transi - tion to the second part , Mr.
Bentley	PERSON	says that our political science is description which does not reach the stage of explanation ; that at - tempts at political philosophy have been specu - lative rather than scientific ; and that scientific explanation , when it comes , will have to be worked out in terms of the conflicting interests of manifold relatively small groups .

		He quotes a German work on political science which says that such explanation is a problem of Sociology , and he evidently holds that Politics as a special social science must avail itself of the principles and methods of general sociology .

		The '' in ter est - group `` interpretation of political activity is com - mon property among Sociologists .

		Yet while Mr.
Bentley	PERSON	disclaims originality , his discussion and illustration of the doctrine is not devoid of that enviable quality .

		He is as willing to depart from a merely common-sense view as those who first argued that the earth is round ; and it may be that some of the useful modes of thought which he advocates will be slow in gaining acceptance for reasons not wholly unlike those that delayed acceptance of the doctrine of the earth 's rotun - dity .

		The second portion of his book should not be ignored by those who wish to keep abreast of modern thought on politics and government .

		Its main teaching is , roughly stated , that govern - ment is an activity of society as a whole , in which every practical interest that is shared by a number of people who are able in any way whatever to make their will effective upon their fellows is , according to the measure of this effect , a governing agency ; and that the process of government can be understood , not by study of constitutions , platforms , and other professedly political documents and activities , but only by analyzing the great complex whole , and then recombining it , in thought , as a synthesis of these group pressures .

		In two volumes of '' Rambling Recollections , '' as they are entitled , and which , he informs his readers at the outset , are '' not an autobiography , nor even a continuous narra - tive , '' and which are '' founded on no diary or record , '' the ex-diplomat puts down , just as they come unbidden to his memory -- and it proves to be a remarkably tenacious one -- stories of persons and places and events that he has had to do with in his more than half a century of service as a government official .

		THE DIAL 15 easier and shorter than to enumerate the celeb - rities he has thus become acquainted with and helped his readers to know more intimately .

		Fifty-four pages of index , mostly of personal names , follow the narrative and indicate in a striking way its anecdotic , even gossipy , nature . ''

		I consider nothing in my recollection irrel - evant , '' writes the author in recording one of his hundreds of anecdotes of persons ; and he ram - bles on -LRB- to use the verb of his own choice -RRB- much as one might in familiar conversation after dinner .

		In fact , not a little of his matter will to many seem too trivial for print ; but it entertains , and it also excites wonder at the writer 's readiness in recalling so many and so varied occurrences after such a lapse of time .

		The division of the book into chapters , seventy in number , serves as a convenient chopping into attractive bits what might otherwise discourage the hardiest reader to undertake .

		Simply as a collection of miscella - neous anecdotes , the matter logically falls into no such sections , although it does try to follow some chronological order .

		Leaving Rugby to enter the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	at sixteen years of age , Sir
Henry	PERSON	was in the diplomatic service at many posts , -- in
Florence	LOCATION	, the
Ionian Islands	LOCATION	,
Bulgaria	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	,
Roumania	LOCATION	, and finally as British Ambas - sador at
Madrid	LOCATION	, whence he returned to private life eight years ago .

		The stories and jokes that enliven Sir
Henry	PERSON	's pages are strung together on so slender a thread that it will be permissible to quote a few of them here with no more system than is observed in their compilation .

		An amus - ing hit at the English tuft-hunter is innocently administered in the following anecdote : '' At a time when I was frequenting the Athenaeum a good deal , a Cingalese gentleman , who had come to
England	LOCATION	to read for the bar , was recommended by Sir
Roderick Murchison	PERSON	to all his acquaintances .

		One day , finding him dining alone , Mr.
Hay	PERSON	ward and I invited him to our table .

		Mr.
Hayward	PERSON	wished to instruct him as to the constitution of English society , and said , ' You will find in
England	LOCATION	that men of distinction , who belong neither to the aristocracy nor to the richer classes , but have made a mark , either in literature or by their con - versational powers , are always received in great houses on a footing of perfect equality .

		You never go to a great house but you will see some distinguished literary man received as one of the most highly honom-ed guests . '

		The
Cingalese	PERSON	said , very naively , ' But are these not called sycophants ? '

		There was complete silence . ''

		A reminiscence of
John Delane	PERSON	, of '' The Times , '' with an incidental witticism from the alert Mr.
Lowe	PERSON	, catches the eye not inoppor - tunely .

		`` During the time I was in the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, I nat - urally made a great many acquaintances , many of whom I have already mentioned ; but there were some who became my friends as I went on in experience , and whom I shall always recollect .

		Mr.
John Delane	PERSON	, the editor of the Times , was exceedingly kind to me .

		1 was introduced to him by Sir
John Burgoyne	PERSON	.

		He had a homelike , old-fashioned , panelled house -- 16 Ser - jeants ' Inn .

		Here he used to give most agreeable dinners , and there came Mr.
Bernal Osborne	PERSON	, Mr.
Lowe	PERSON	, and the most amusing people in
London	LOCATION	.

		On one occasion we were talking of a member of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	supposed to be a great failure .

		Some one said , ` They want to make him a peer . '

		Mr.
Lowe	PERSON	retorted , • No , they want to make him disappear . ' ''

		The change and expansion that the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	has undergone since the author 's entrance there as '' additional clerk '' in
1846	DATE	is signifi - cant .

		In his day , he tells us , there was on the ordinary staff one permanent Under-Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	, and also one political , whereas now there are three assistant Under-Secretaries in addition to these .

		Two Legal Advisers are now appointed to the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	; in Sir
Henry	PERSON	's time there was none .

		Twenty-eight clerks in the diplomatic establishment , of whom seven were
Heads of Departments	ORGANIZATION	, have in - creased to forty-four , eight of whom are
Heads of Departments	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Financial Department	ORGANIZATION	has been correspondingly enlarged , also the Librarian 's
Department	ORGANIZATION	, and , in short , '' the force of the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	has been augmented to an enormous extent . ''

		That the earlier and far smaller force of clerks was at times sadly overworked appears from the narrative .

		It must not be inferred that the book is wholly devoted to personal anecdotes .

		Political topics are discussed , but as the discussions often concern dead issues , or matters of interest chiefly to English statesmen , the present review will not concern itself with them .

		As the author , in addition to his diplomatic service abroad , was also in
Parliament	LOCATION	for some years -LRB- from
1874	DATE	to
1880	DATE	, and again from
1880	DATE	to 1885 -RRB- , parliamentary questions as well as par - liamentarians furnish matter for his pages .

		He remarks on the almost invariable absence of personal animosity between the bitterest politi - cal foes . ''

		One of the greatest examples of this , '' he continues , `` was the late Lord Lans - downe , who , though a strong politician , never allowed party feeling to actuate private actions .

		I recoUect hearing him say to one of his guests that he was very anxious about
Lord Derby	PERSON	, who was ill , as he was one of his oldest friends . ''

		Of the ever-delightful Labouchdre he says that he was the wittiest man in the
House of Com	ORGANIZATION	- mons , and that , though at times he was politi - cally unpopular , all who knew him felt a strong friendship for him .

		His wit , clever but some - times over-elaborate , was always good-natured .

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, From the time of the
Berlin Congress	ORGANIZATION	there comes down an excellent Bismarck anecdote .

		The Chancellor had one day received
Lord Odo Russell	PERSON	, the English Ambassador , and was chatting with him familiarly and at some length , when the visitor took occasion to ask his host whether he was not often annoyed by having his callers prolong their interviews miduly .

		Bis - marck replied that he had a private arrangement with his wife whereby she took care to send for him on some pretext whenever it appeared that his hospitality was being abused .

		Just then a servant entered and told the Prince , from the Princess , that it was time for him to take his medicine .

		As the author was in
Spain	LOCATION	, in the capacity of British Ambassador , at the time of the Spanish - American War , it is interesting to note his com - ment on that event .

		`` The difficulties caused by the disagreement with
America	LOCATION	were incalculable .

		The
United States	LOCATION	declared -- and their subsequent conduct verified their declara - tion -- that they did not seek to annex
Cuba	LOCATION	, which an American gentleman described to me as ` the richest slice of earth , ' nor to establish a Protectorate over the island .

		The first alternative , they considered , would disturb the voting balance of the
United States	LOCATION	, and the latter would entail endless care and responsibility .

		The Americans were desirous that
Spain	LOCATION	should settle the war in a manner just and honourable to herself , while securing to
Cuba	LOCATION	peace and prosperity ... `` In
Spain	LOCATION	, unfortunately , the acceptance of party office often paralyses Ministerial energy , and even with an army of 130,000 men , and an expenditure of a million a month , but Uttle progress was made in crushing out the insurrection by force .

		These difficulties were en - hanced by financial straits and by the interference of the
United States Legislature	LOCATION	.

		The obvious solution of the difficulty was the concession of liberties sufficient to satisfy the Cuban people .

		This , as has been said , was the aim of the
United States	LOCATION	Government ; but the Spanish Government dreaded any spontaneous action ... ''
Spain	LOCATION	's difficulties were great .

		The fact that , notwithstanding the loss of her colonies , the present dynasty remains unshaken is entirely due to the Queen Regent , who struggled almost unaided at this trying crisis .

		When we left
Spain	LOCATION	, the feeling of loyalty towards her Majesty was very much on the increase .

		That loyalty has been extended to her son .

		Perhaps
Spain	LOCATION	may prosper , as
England	LOCATION	prospered notwith - standing the loss of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The author 's friendly feeling for
America	LOCATION	becomes again apparent in his preface , which we take to be his closing word to the reader .

		He says of his book : '' There are many points omitted .

		I have not even alluded to the great change in English society caused by the influx of American notables .

		I believe that this pecu - liar feature of recent years is likely to bring great improvement and advantage to both countries . ''

		He then names some still-living Americans whose acquaintance has brought him especial pleasure .

		The mechanical execution of these two ample volumes , with their large print in Scotch-face type , and their interesting portraits and other illustrations , is all that could be desired .

		Errors of typography or of proof-reading are welcomely absent , although one of the author 's stories -- concerning the remarkable detection of an assassin by means of his handwriting -- is marred by the misspelling of the French terra graphologie ^ which appears as graphiologie .

		Whatever criticism the author may have sub - jected himself to -- and he frankly says , `` I am prepared to accept criticism without remon - strance '' -- he will not be censured as having taxed his readers ' attention in a manner unbe - fitting this season of rest and recreation .

Louns	PERSON	- bury 's collected essays on `` The Standard of Usage in English '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , and especially from the second chapter , entitled '' Is English Becoming Corrupt ? ''

		It will be found from the author 's researches that the lament over an imagined deprav - ity of disposition displayed by current speech is almost as old as speech itself , and that the really alarming symptom would be a halt in this alleged downward course of language ; for that would mean that the language was dead , or rather that its users were dead , intellectually at least .

		The whole book emphasizes the truth -- which not even the pedant and the purist would dispute in so many words , but which it is well to have brought freshly home to us now and then -- that language was made for man , not man for language .

		Usage , and not grammar or logic or reason , is the authority to which all , even the crabbedest of grammarians , consciously or un - consciously bow .

		But it is the usage of the best writers and speakers , and to some extent it is present rather than past usage .

		While the author makes all this clear , he says not a word on the interesting question that must occur to many read - ers , What rule is there for deciding who are the best writers and speakers , especially among the living ?

		The assaults , vigorous and effective , made by Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	on many pet prejudices -- as , for instance , on the prejudice against the split infinitive , and that against '' none '' as a plural pronoun -- may scandalize the purists ; but with the history of the language at his command the assailant
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 is a doughty foeman to repulse .

		A careful reading of the book ought to instil into even the most pragmatic and dogmatic of self-appointed language - menders a shyness in venturing upon verbal criti - cism .

		After learning that the unprepossessing form '' illy '' is found in such respectable writers as Fielding ,
Southey	PERSON	, and
Washington Irving	LOCATION	, one becomes reticent of even deliberate censure , far more of '' snap '' judgments .

		A little disappointing is the author 's unconcern as to the ultimate fate of '' shall '' and '' wiU , '' '' should '' and '' would . ''

		Let usage determine ; he remains a calm looker-on .

		Of course usage will determine ; and that means that what was once a clearly defined and useful distinc - tion will soon be obliterated , and the language wUl be so much the poorer .

		Again , one is a little sur - prised to find so careful a writer using '' individuals '' in the sense of '' persons , '' where no contradistinction from collective humanity is intended .

		A dash of humor , with occasionally a bite of sarcasm , gives flavor and relish to Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's pages .

		The book is excellent reading as well as sound doc - trine .

		Considerable additions have been made to the several chapters since their original appearance in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		The relations ^ ^ ^ lunae bearing the impress of of medicine the official book of the ''
Emmanuel	PERSON	and religion .

		movement '' at once has a definite purpose and appeal .

		In the background of the historical consciousness is the feeling that originally the priest and physician were one ; and the query has been newly raised .

		Which one ?

		In kinship with this feeling , or belief , is the renewed convic - tion that the Church must be practical , and be all things to all men .

		The modern interpretation of this doctrine finds a specific embodiment in the several new faiths that bring into the focus of their creed the practice of healing .

		The * '
Emmanuel	PERSON	movement '' is the expression of a desire to be help - ful to human frailty without incurring an adherence to extreme theories and a complete abandonment of religious affiliation .

		On the theoretical side , each person interested is likely to adjust his faith and his science in accordance with his predilections .

		On the practical side , the movement is significant be - cause it is rational .

		Dr.
Worcester	PERSON	and his asso - ciates accept no cases without the diagnosis of a competent specialist , and suggest no treatment except as approved by such medical authority .

		They indulge in no self-deceptive '' demonstrations '' that the obvious does not exist .

		They recognize that science alone can determine disease and give the rational basis for its treatment .

		But equally they recognize that there is usually , and in nervous dis - eases always , a large psychical factor , and that this psychical factor is amenable to the modes of minis - tration that the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is ready to assume .

		Men , after all , are more largely regulated by their emo - tions than by their intellect ; the emotions con - cerned are accessible only to appeal through human sympathy and moral support of a type that the worthy and helpful minister frequently can offer .

		That certain churchmen will have legitimate doubts as to whether or not this is the proper work for the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and certain physicians will have as strong doubts as to whether the whole of the treatment should not be left to their own body , is inevitable .

		For the present , the experience is such as to sug - gest a distinctly successftJ field for these endeavors .

		The volume on '' Religion and Medicine '' by Dr.
Worcester	PERSON	and Dr.
McComb	PERSON	from the religious side , and by Dr.
Coriat	PERSON	from the medical side , serves in some measure as a declaration of principles .

		The several contributors do not really agree , nor can the exposition be said to be particularly helpful to those acquainted with the current views as to psychic treatment .

		Dr.
Worcester	PERSON	's insistence upon an in - dependent and mystic subconscious mind is unfor - tunate , and does not strengthen the practical side of the volume .

		But it will serve a timely and useful purpose , and for that it should be welcomed .

		Perhaps it may seem to the uninitiated much more easy and pleasant to read a novel by way of work than to delve in crabbed treatises , dreary old histories , or interminable epics .

		People who think so may well try the experiment .

		However this may be , there are now a number of dissertations , treatises , and books on topics under the head of Fiction , and among them is Dr.
Martha P. Conant	PERSON	's `` The Oriental Tale in
England	LOCATION	in the Eighteenth Cen - tury '' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The students of fiction have a good deal of interest in the eighteenth - century tale as a predecessor of the short story so prevalent in the nineteenth century .

		Dr.
Conant	PERSON	, however , though she does touch the question of form , is in this monograph chiefly concerned with the subject-matter .

		She traces the growing interest in
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	stories in
Western Europe	LOCATION	, touching even on the earliest times , but making her real beginning with the first English version of the '' Arabian Nights . ''

		It is certainly a curious story .

		The pos - sibilities and impossibilities of the

		There are added some notes , a list of about a hun - dred important Oriental tales , a list of the literature of the subject , and an Index which , as far as we have experimented with it , is quite correct .

		8 vectsof ^ ^ ^ reader who nears the end of
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Richard H. P. Curle	PERSON	's '' Aspects novelist and poet , ^ f George Meredith '' -LRB- Button -RRB- with the feeling that for want of a vigorous central idea the work lacks force , comes upon a confession which takes the wind from his critical sails .

		For Mr.
Curie	PERSON	unpretentiously says in his last chapter that it is in - deed probable that he has not even understood much of what Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	teaches , and that he has tried to do no more than write about some of those features which have struck him as of exceptional interest .

		These various '' aspects '' of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	are here considered ; he is described as a poet and a '' novel - ist of types , '' steering the middle course between idealism and realism ; his characteristics are dis - cussed from the view-points of his personality , his attitude toward nature , his conceptions of social prob - lems , his handling of character and diverse phases of humanity , his sense of comedy , his wit and humor , and his eloquence .

		This method of classification , somewhat necessary in critical writing , when carried to excess becomes artificial ; and Mr.
Curie	PERSON	's care - ful nuances of definition at times weary the reader without pleasurably enlightening him .

		His inter - pretation of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	in general , however , is appreciative and illuminating , conscious as he is of the great writer 's '' true and consistent outlook , '' his `` sense of poetry and poetic fitness , '' his self - consciousness , the very source of his eloquence .

		Especially pertinent is Mr.
Curie	PERSON	's exposition of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's philosophical and lyrical view of nature , of his treatment of women , of his sense of comedy .

		It is somewhat startling to come upon the assertion that Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	is too intellectual to have absolute sympathy with humanity , and in this quality alone , according to Mr.
Curie	PERSON	, he fails to reach the most profound and exact idea of character .

		His heart and soul , however , are filled with the great and permanent thoughts ; and for this reason he will come through the ordeal of criticism into the light of true recognition .

		Eavptian '' ^ recent importation of Messrs. civilization Scribner is ''
Bonaparte	PERSON	in
Egypt	LOCATION	down to date .

		^ nd the Egyptians of
Today	DATE	, '' by
Haji A. Browne	PERSON	, an Englishman who , it seems , has assimilated the oriental civilization .

		The author declares that during the last twelve hundred years six great events have influenced Egyptian history : the Arab conquest , the Turkish conquest , the French invasion , the rise of
Mahomet Ali	ORGANIZATION	, the English oc - cupation , and the evacuation of Fachoda by the French .

		Of this book , the larger part is devoted to the French invasion , with some attention to the later history of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The author 's purpose is to interpret the Egyptain character , and in so doing to make clear how the French and English have blundered when trying to rule this people .

		It is his thesis that whUe for scores of hundreds of years foreign rulers have governed the land , none of them has made any effort to understand the people and secure their cooperation .

		This was especially true , it is asserted , of the French , who were untactful and impatient in their attempts to force revolutionary reforms upon an alien race .

		Unfortunately , the author has chosen not to indicate the authorities upon whom he bases his account , though it is clear that almost the whole of the part about the French invasion and its results is taken from the native historian Gabarty , or Jibarty .

		He is very reckless in dealing with the facts of European history , and his generalizations are sweeping and frequently contradictory .

		He makes it clear that under French and English rule the Egyptians had the best gov - ernment in their history , and yet he spends pages denouncing European methods .

		One result of his delineation of the character of Egyptians is to make them appear a peculiarly worthless lot -- something certainly not intended .

		In spite of its mmaerous faults , the book has distinct value .

		It describes the various elements of the Egyptian population and their relation each to the others , it makes somewhat intelligible the relation of the subject people to their rulers during their long history , it shows how evil has resulted from the attempt to force European standards upon an Oriental people , and finally it explains the various healthy and unhealthy influ - ences operating to-day in the land of the Pharaohs .

		The pursuit of his investigations included the measurement of a hundred men and twenty-five women in each population -LRB- fourteen measurements being taken upon each subject -RRB- , the making of plaster casts of the heads and busts of five individuals in each tribe , and the taking of photo - graphs illustrating the scenery , occupations , char - acter of buildings , costumes , and habits of life , encountered on the way .

		In a population ignorant , timid , and suspicious , such a plan was necessarily fraught with difficxilty and personal danger , even after the interest of the political and ecclesiastical authorities had been procured .

		The scientific re - sults of these journeys have been published in a

		In a large octavo of more than four hundred pages with the title '' In Indian Mexico '' -LRB-
Forbes & Company	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- Professor
Starr	PERSON	gives to the general pub - lic a narrative of travel in a part of
Mexico	LOCATION	that has heretofore escaped the notice of the traveller and writer , with only incidental references to the scientific phases of his journeys .

		That the journeys were filled with experiences ranging from the comic to the tragic , may be taken for granted .

		That the narrative has literary faults , can not be denied .

		Many of the author 's experiences were repeated , with but slight variations , in several places , and did not require the explicit repetition which they receive .

		And the meagre accounts of some tragic experiences serve to pique the reader 's curiosity without grati - fying it .

		But these faults are largely atoned for by the general interest of the narrative , and especially by the hundred and sixty half-tone illustrations from the author 's photographs .

		By publishing his '' Winter Days in ^ ` Ji ^ lTZT I `` ^ ^ '' ^ t the beginning of
summer	DATE	, Mr.
Lazell	PERSON	makes it possible for us to learn how much relief from heat can be had from reading about cold .

		It is refreshing to the senses and stimulating to the imagination to read on a day when the mercury in the thermometer is much too high for comfort , that '' the snow is piling high under the hazelbrush and the sumac , '' or that there is `` a continuous sound of grinding ice from the river . ''

		Mr.
Lazell	PERSON	has little that is new to say about Nature , but his book is opportune in this com - fort of suggested contrast , and farther enjoyable for its delicate sense of the beauty of winter woods and meadows .

		Moreover , there is often a new grace in the manner of saying things , as in this appreciation of
March	DATE	wind in the tree-tops : '' The coarse , an - gular , unyielding twigs of the oaks give deep tones like the vibrations of the thick strings on the big double-bass .

		The opposite widespreading twigs of the ash sing like the ` cello , and the tones of the alternating sprays of the lindens are finer , like the viola .

		The still smaller opposite twigs of the maples murmur like the tender tones of the altos and the fine yielding spray of the birches .

		The feathery elm and the hackberry make music pure and sweet as the waUing of the first violins . ''

		The philosopher `` There is no escaping
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		of hyperbole You may hold him a hissing and a and paradox .

		mockery and lift your virtuous skirts as you pass him by , but his roar is in your ears and his blasphemies sink into your mind .

		He has coloured the thought and literature , the speculation and theorizing , the politics and superstition of the time .

		He reigns as king in the German universities -- where , since Luther 's day , all the world 's most painful thinking has been done -- and his echoes tinkle , harshly or faintly , from
Chicago	LOCATION	to Meso - potamia . ''

		The fervid , vigorous style and the hyper - bolic impressiveness of Mr.
Henry F. Mencken	PERSON	's book are well illustrated in this passage from his Introduction to an exposition of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's phil - osophy .

		Despite his seemingly dispassionate atti - tude toward the doctrine of his subject , Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	reveals himself as so ardent and so expert an advo - cate that one is tempted to reach over his head to administer a few thumps to the prophet himself .

		But that would require a separate chapter .

		Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	has produced a very readable book and a better presentation of Nietzsche to the English reader than is elsewhere available .

		Critically speak - ing , it has one serious fault , -- that the reader is often left in doubt as to where the author is speak - ing his own views and where he is merely presenting those of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	.

		This is no problem to one already familiar with the German-Polish prophet , but the book is evidently intended for those to whom he is a stranger .

		Quotation , condensed abstract and com - ment are often merged so gradually and smoothly that only an adept can recognize the limits of the last element .

		This is unfortunate in the exposition of a philosopher so full of hyperbole and paradox as
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the other hand , Mr.
Mencken	PERSON	has so steeped himself in the style and spirit of
Nietzsche	PERSON	that his book has almost the unity of a first-hand production .

		Like the original , it can be trusted to reveal to the reader the one-sided , unsound , and often illogical nature of the thought of this strange , and it is to be hoped transient , phenomenon in German philosophy .

John Sherman	PERSON	.

		J ^ ^ ''
Sherman	PERSON	played an important financier and part in the history of this country statesman .

		during its second half-century , and it was his desire that this part should be fully known to his countrymen and to the world .

		During his lifetime he published two large volumes of remin - iscences , giving his own version of the history of his time and of his part in that history ; and in his will he provided for a formal biography .

		This bio - graphy has now appeared in two large volumes written by a fellow-townsman , Mr.
Winfield S. Kerr	PERSON	, and published by Messrs.
Sherman	PERSON	, French ,
& Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book contains a vast amount of information about our history and politics during the period of
Sherman	PERSON	's public life , and every step in his career is minutely set forth in its relations to current affairs ; it may be useful as a storehouse of facts , generally fairly given , though these may usually be obtained more easily from books of ref - erence and formal histories .

		It is a biography of the old-fashioned type , written by a man who has been active in politics but without much training in literary work .

		The actions of the hero are not always allowed to speak for themselves , and super - latives are freely used in the effort to make the reader appreciate his virtues .

		Students of financial affairs especially will find here much to interest them , for
John Sherman	PERSON	was certainly one of the gi `` eat practical financiers of our history .

September	DATE	.

		A new edition of Madison 's '' Journal , '' with facsimile illustrations , edited and extensively annotated by Mr.
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	, occupies two dignified volumes now pub - lished by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The '' Elements of Physical Geography '' which Pro- fessor
Thomas C. Hopkins	PERSON	has prepared for
Messrs. H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is a new and abundantly illus - trated text-book , based upon many years of practical teaching .

		A new novel by
Miss Theodora Peck	PERSON	, author of ''
Hester	PERSON	of the Grants , '' is announced for
August	DATE	issue .

		It will be called '' The Sword of Dundee , '' and contains many of the famous characters of the days of ''
Bonnie Prince Charlie	PERSON	. ''

		A college text-book of '' General Physics , '' by Pro- fessor
Henry Crew	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is described as an elementary work , to be used by first-year students .

		We shoidd imagine the average freshman would find its five hundred pages a fairly stiff dose .

		M. Ren ^
Bazin	PERSON	's novel '' The Nun '' has aroused such interest in this country that the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	will publish another of this author 's novels , '' The Growing Grain , '' a translation of '' Le Bl ^ qui Lfeve , '' which has already passed a sale of one hundred thousand copies in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		A Bibliography of
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	, '' com - piled by Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	, has just been added by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	to their beautifully printed series of bibliographies of famous American authors .

		A portrait of
Emerson	LOCATION	as he looked in
1859	DATE	serves as the frontispiece of the volume .

		Mr.
Brooks Adams	PERSON	, who has been at work for two or three years upon a biography of his grandfather ,
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, will soon furnish the manuscript to
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who have engaged to publish it in their '' American Crisis Biographies . ''

		The work is made up largely from new material in posses - sion of the family .

		With the publication of a third volume , '' The
Oxford Treasury	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature , '' edited by Messrs.
G. E. Hadow	PERSON	and
W. H. Hadow	PERSON	, is now complete .

		The plan of the work is continued as before -- brief biographical and critical notices , followed by lengthy illustrative examples .

		The present volume reaches all the way from MUton to
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Vernon L. Kellogg	PERSON	of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, author of `` American Insects , '' `` Darwinism To-day , '' etc. , has in press with
Messrs. Henry Holt Co.	ORGANIZATION	, to be issued in their
American Nature Series	ORGANIZATION	, a volume entitled '' Insect Stories . ''

		These '' strange , true stories of insect life '' are primarily for young folks , but will also appeal to grown-up nature-lovers .

		In connection with the very general and keen interest in the revival of arts and crafts in
America	LOCATION	it is interest - ing to look into the past , particularly to those centuries known as the Middle Ages , in which the handicrafts flourished in special perfection , and to see how these crafts were pursued , and exactly what these arts really were .

		An interesting work on this subject by
Julia deW	ORGANIZATION	.

		Addison will be published shortly by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title `` The Arts and Crafts of the Middle Ages . ''

		Miss
Grace Norton	ORGANIZATION	's series of books about
Montaigfne	PERSON	has been enlarged by two new volumes .

		One of them is a collection of passages concerning '' his personal rela - tions to some of his contemporaries and his literary relations to some later writers '' ; the other , called '' The Spirit of Montaigne , '' is an anthology of passages repro - ducing something of the thought and expression of the famous '' Essays . ''

		The volumes are published by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .46 NOTES 46 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 47 JONAS LIE .

		The great names of Ibsen and Bjomson have so overshadowed the names of their fellow - workers in the field of letters that to the world at large they have appeared to comprise the sum total of contemporary Norwegian literature .


Norway	LOCATION	is so small a country that it has seemed something of a concession on the part of the out - side public to recognize the significance of even its two foremost spokesmen to mankind , and nothing short of compelling geniite would have been able to force such a tribute .

		Nevertheless ,
Norway	LOCATION	has been for the past century a nation in spirit -LRB- now being one in fact also -RRB- , and from the days when Wergeland sounded his trumpet call of emancipation all the way down to our own its proud people have claimed the attributes of other and larger peoples , and among those at - tributes the possession of a distinctive national literature .

		That literature , as the investigator speedily discovers , is surprisingly rich when we consider all the circumstances of its development , and is adorned by many names besides those of its Dioscuri of world-wide fame .

		Among those names that of
Jonas Lie	PERSON	, who died at
Christiania	LOCATION	on the fifth of this month , in his seventy-fifth year , takes a high place -- perhaps the place of third importance in the Norwegian literature of the past forty years .

		Less than a year the junior of Bjomson , and only five years the junior of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Jonas Lauritz Idemil	PERSON	Lie was bom
November 6 , 1833	DATE	, the son of a lawyer father and a Finnish mother .

		The late Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	found in him a sort of dual personality , and sought to account for it by the mingling of strains that gave him birth .

		From his mother he '' inherited the fantastic strain in his blood , the strange super - stitious terrors , and the luxuriant wealth of color which he lavished upon his poems and his first novel . ''

		From his father he '' derived his good sense , his intense appreciation of detail , and his strong grip on reality .

		His career represents at its two poles a progression from the adven - turous romanticism of his maternal heritage to the severe wide-awake realism of the paternal -- the emancipation of the Norseman from the
Finn	LOCATION	. ''

		It was the
Finn	ORGANIZATION	in him that first de - veloped and found expression in his writings , 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, for his boyhood was spent in
Nordland	LOCATION	, where nature is fantastic and superstition is in the air .

		Afterwards , when he became a lawyer , and contracted one of the most lastingly happy of marriages , the Norseman got the upper hand , and he became hard-headed and practical .

		As a boy , his first ambition was to be a gun - smith , his next to go to sea .

		He was actually an applicant for naval training , but was rejected on account of myopia .

		After this rebuff , there was nothing for it but the regular educational grind , so he went to
Christiania	LOCATION	, and passed through the preparatory school to the
Univer	LOCATION	- sity .

		Bjornson and
Ibsen	PERSON	were both among his associates at this time , and then began his life - long friendship with the former , to whose early influence he often acknowledged a deep indebt - edness .

		His parents wanted to make him a parson , but he preferred to become a lawyer , and was presently at work in the practice of his profession in the rich lumber town of Kongsvinger .

		He regarded the calling he had chosen as a choice of evils , but he prospered in it -- giving it variety by dabblings in politics and journalism -- and in the early thirties found himself a fairly well-to-do man and an important personage .

		Then came the financial crash of 1867-8 , which swept away every dollar he had , besides leaving him technically responsible for many more -- the consequence of an easy-going habit of endorsing commercial paper for his friends .

		This catastrophe marked the turning - point in Lie 's life .

		He decided to abandon the law and become a man of letters .

		He even determined , manfidly , and perhaps quixotically , to follow
Scott	PERSON	's example , and earn by novel - writing the wherewithal to meet the heavy obligations which weighed him down , and from which he might easily enough have obtained legal release .

		From the time of his early twenties .

		Lie had been a scribbler of verse , but his song was more rugged than pleasing , and its cacophonies more frequent than its harmonies .

		Nevertheless , the volume of his '' Poems , '' dated
1867	DATE	, and re - issued , with additions , more than a score of years later , has to be reckoned with .

		It includes ringing songs of the sea and studies in fantastic romance that betoken a genuine gift .

		But it was as a novelist that Lie was to gain his real fame , and when he started life over again in
Christiania	LOCATION	, it was to the writing of fiction that he gave his best energies .

		For the first years , life was hard .

		He had a wife and four chil - dren , and it was not easy to support them .

		He eked out some sort of a living by school-teaching and political journalism , until , in
1870	DATE	, he achieved a brilliant success with '' The Vision - ary , '' his first novel .

		It was a revelation of the Finnish side of his personality , and was filled with the memories of his youth under the Arctic circle .

		Besides bringing him a financial reward , this novel also brought him govern - mental recognition , which at first took the form of a travelling stipend for several years , and then made him , like
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Ibsen	PERSON	, the recipient of the annual '' poet 's salary '' with which the enlightened Norwegian nation encour - ages literary talent .

		The amount is not large , but the honor is great , and is apt to stimulate to heightened endeavor .

		He went to
Rome	LOCATION	, that Mecca of Scandinavian men of letters , and devoted himself to the double task of broaden - ing his culture and writing further novels .

		The succeeding years produced a long series of books , of which we may mention the following : '' The Barque Future '' -LRB- 1872 -RRB- , `` The Pilot and His Wife '' -LRB- 1874 -RRB- , ''
Thomas Ross	PERSON	'' -LRB- 1878 -RRB- , ''
Adam Schrader	PERSON	'' -LRB- 1879 -RRB- , ''
Rutland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , '' Press On '' -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , `` The Life Prisoner '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- , `` The Family at Gilje '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- , `` A Mael - strom '' -LRB- 1884 -RRB- , '' Married Life '' -LRB- 1887 -RRB- , '' Maisa Jons '' -LRB- 1888 -RRB- , `` The Commodore 's Daughters '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , '' Powers of Evil '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , '' Niobe '' -LRB- 1893 -RRB- , and '' When the Curtain Falls '' -LRB-
1901	DATE	-RRB- .

		This list is far from complete , but it includes the most important titles .

		The book last-named , like Ibsen 's '' When We Dead Awake , '' is a sort of epilogue to the work of his life .

		A contemporary critio .

		Dr.
Poul Levin	PERSON	, calls it Lie 's deepest and most comprehensive work . ''

		It has a sort of finality , because it comprises all of Lie 's other books , and may hardly be understood without taking them for granted . ''

		Besides the books above named .

		Lie was the author of many sketches and short stories , and of a few works in dramatic form , the most noticeable of which , ''
Grabow	PERSON	's Cat , '' enjoyed a moderate theatrical success .

		We must say a special word of '' Trold , '' a collection of fantastic tales published in
1892	DATE	.

		In this work the incurable romanticism of his nature once more found expression , and the realist seemed to have disappeared .

		Bpyesen says of this work : `` It was as if a volcano , with writhing torrents of flame and smoke , had burst forth from under a sidewalk in Broadway . ''

		When we consider the totality of his work , in connection with the fact that his first novel was not written until he had reached middle life , we must wonder at a literary activity so surprising .

		For his work , volumin - ous as it is , was always conscientiously done , and
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 29 everywhere exhibits a fineness of texture that betokens the artist .

		In the course of his development , Lie essayed several styles and themes .

		His earlier successes seemed to mark him as the novelist of sea-faring folk , and to set him beside his Danish contem - porary
Drachmann	PERSON	.

		Later , he plunged into real - ism , and '' The Life Prisoner '' brought him into comparison with Zola and Dostoievsky .

		The special problems of business life had a fascina - tion for him ; he knew them well from his own experience , and worked them into some of his novels .

		In the delineation of his heroines , and the presentation of the feminine point of view , he exhibited an insight and a delicate sympathy that made him comparable with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lastly , he was the novelist of the home , with its tender intimacies and its strong influence upon the development of character .

		It is perhaps in this last aspect , as illustrated by '' The Family at Gilje '' and '' Married Life , '' that he is most cherished by his fellow-countrymen .

		From the time of his first visit to
Rome	LOCATION	, Lie 's life was that of a cosmopolitan .


Paris	LOCATION	was his favorite residence , and , in fact , his home for a large part of every year .

		He felt , no less strongly than
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, that the chief need of Scandinavians was to be kept in contact with the fresh currents of the intellec - tual life of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He spoke particularly of the '' eruptive '' character of German , French , and Russian literature , and of the way in which they '' were showering the kindling sparks of new ideas and glowing aspirations upon the farthest corners of the earth . ''

		But his inter - pretation of modern modes of thought always made for soberness and sanity , and he was never tempted to join the band of those modern writers who seem to think that genius , to prove its title , must be erratic .

		His work now ended , he has joined the wife whose companionship was the chief factor in his happiness , and whose death , not long ago , was such a grief as he had never before known .

		State honors were be - stowed upon his obsequies .

		The westward movement of the
American Library - Association	ORGANIZATION	, in its change of headquarters from
Boston	LOCATION	to
Chicago	LOCATION	, as decreed by the librarians lately in session at
Minnetonka	LOCATION	, is a natural and a desirable action .

		The centre of the American library world is no longer in
New England	LOCATION	, energetic and progressive though that section of the country has always been in all that relates to the diffusion of learning .

		As already observed by us ,
Chicago	LOCATION	is becoming more and more nearly the centre of our library-using population , and it will be a good many years before that central point , or central meridian , will be found to have shifted still further toward the west .

		THE SOLIDARITY OF LITERATURE .

		If a stranger to our planet , unacquainted with its natural laws , were to go down to the margin of the sea , at the lowest ebb of the tide , he would find the ocean stretching motionless before him , apparently fixed within set bounds .

		But presently little tongues of wave would begin to run up unto his feet ; if he stood stiU they would encircle him and cut him off from dry land ; then the billows would come rolling in , each higher than the last ; he would look about him in despair ; it would seem to him that that quiet thing , the sea , had become alive , and was preparing to swallow the earth and the monuments thereof .

		But our stranger need only to wait ; the earth would still lift its head above the waters ; little by little these would recede , and everything would be as it was before .

		The movements and momentary fads of litera - ture are much like the tides .

		They are necessary to keep the ocean of life from stagnating , the world of humanity alive ; but they are recurrent , periodical , and do not change anything very much .

		The banners under which artists and writers fight -- the watchwords , shibboleths , party cries which they go forward sounding , -- are fine things to inspire them , to keep them together , to nerve them for the struggle .

		Men are always more willing to go out and be killed if they are dressed up in uniform and have a standard advancing before them .

		And the waving of flags , the flourishing of trumpets , the agitations of battle , are good to impress and draw the attention of the public .

		Mankind would prob - ably sit down content with its old art , if every now and then someone did not start up to tell it that the work of the past was faded and false and foolish , and that he had a recipe for a new literature , a new music , a new painting , which would rejuvenate the world .

		And , being curious , mankind very often does trade the old lamps for the new ones and gives away a talisman which can command the genii for a tin vessel .

		There are , and always have been , two great armies encamped over against each other in litera - ture -- the idealists and the realists : those who paint man as he is , and those who paint him as he should be ; those who draw from the idea , and those who copy from experience .

		All the skirmishes , forays , onsets , retreats and changing fortunes of literature are part of this great war .

		Yet the com - batants are always changing sides or setting up separate standards of their own , and in the last analysis there is so little difference between them that the mellay seems to be carried on for fun rather than for principle .

		In one of the first and finest pieces of literary criticism we have , '' The Frogs '' of Aristophanes , the struggle I have indicated is shown as on in full force .

		The great comic poet adored - fli ^ schylus , respected Sophocles , and detested Euripides as a newcomer and a leveller .

		Undoubtedly there are differences in the poetic gifts of the three men -- 30 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, between the heroic sublimity of ^ schylus , the serene steady art of Sophocles , and the sentimental and pa - thetic naturalness of Euripides , But they all painted life , they all projected wonderful and remarkable figures , and the work of one could very easily be mistaken for that of another , ^ schylus might have been proud to claim the Bacchanals , and Euripides might easily have signed the
Philoctetes	LOCATION	.

		To-day all their pieces are alike classic and supposed to be separated by a wide gulf of demarcation from mod - ern work .

		I say supposed ; for the Greek plays have the one and only quality which really counts in literature -- vitality .

		Even as stage plays , given a fair chance , they could probably hold their own against anything new .

		The terms '' classic '' and '' romantic '' came into use in
Germany	LOCATION	perhaps a hundred and fifty years ago as the shibboleths of two opposing factions .

		Classic was supposed to indicate a view of life , an attitude of mind , sane , noble , healthy ; romantic , a diseased and morbid condition of thought which drove one to deal in horrors of any kind -- - death - heads , charnel vaults , religious mania , sexual aber - rations , the supernatural .

		Goethe , by precept and example , pointing to Greek literature , enforced this distinction .

		I confess I am unable to see anything eminently sane and wholesome in the horrible stories of Agamemnon or Qidipus , in the murderous frenzies of Achilles .

		And the supernatural in the Odyssey , the Persians , the
Golden Ass of Apuleius	ORGANIZATION	, is very much like the supernatural in the Divine Comedy ,
Hamlet	LOCATION	, or the folk-lore stories .

		It must be remem - bered that we have very little of Greek literature .

		If we could browse through the Alexandrian library we could probably find a parallel and analogue for every modern book or mode of thought .

		After the classicists and romanticists had fought out their fight , the realists came upon the scene and buried their predecessors , dead and living alike , -- and , indeed , buried the whole past , as savoring of decay .

		Nothing was worth while except brand-new documents of life .

		Everything had to be painted or photographed from the model ; and as the easiest models to come at were of the low or middle classes , literature sunk at once to the mediocre in intelli - gence and form .

		Prose superseded verse -- the novel , the drama .

		The return to nature which was preached meant a descent to the commonplace .

		Writers went about by the score with their note - books open to take down the most meaningless chatter or to mark the most insignificant acts of mankind .

		Any old bore of a farmer or sailor or fisherman could become the hero ; any empty - headed , goose-necked girl , the heroine of a book .

		But as the poorest writer in the world inevitably craves for something strong in character or plot or situation , realism broke into two branches -- one , naturalism , dealing with the horrible details of pov - erty and vice , and finally setting up a school of its own , the decadents , who glorified these things ; and the other , satire , which healthfully reacted upon its material with humor -- poured salt in the wounds of life to heal them .

		It is hardly necessary to say that none of the doctrines of realism were new -- none of its works without previous example .

		The new comedy of
Athens	LOCATION	must have precisely antici - pated , and in a more brilliant fashion , all that our realists have done .

		The young poet who was ad - vised to study the people , and replied that he had just bought a copy of
Terence	PERSON	and Plautus , was not so far wrong .

		Lucian and Petronius could give points to Zola or Maupassant .

		Indeed , there is a Hindoo play -- '' The Little Clay Cart '' of
King Shudraka	LOCATION	-- which , sixteen hundred years old , is fresher and truer in its realistic painting of life than almost any modern play or novel .

		And , strange to say , from this primitive Asiatic comedy emerge two of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's most wonderful figui `` es , Cloten and
Imogen	PERSON	.

		The latest organized movement in literature seems to be that of Symbolism .

		Symbolism , I suppose , is largely the thing that used to be called allegory -- and allegory is as old as the world .

		Whole epochs have been dominated by it -- as , for example , the
thirteenth century	DATE	, when the two authors of the Roman de la Rose produced a pivotal work which influenced
Dante	ORGANIZATION	on the one hand and Spenser on the other .

		Mankind has about made up its mind , however , that these poets are great in spite of , rather than because of , their allegory .

		As
Hazlitt	PERSON	said , if you let the allegory in their works alone it wo n't bite you .

		Literature finally threw off the symbolical and produced
Shakespeare	PERSON	with his direct rendering of life .

		Whatever we may think of the allegorical , the symbolical , the mystical qualities in literature , it is certain that they are nothing new , and it is doubtful whether they can again do any - thing which will equal their elaborate exercise in the past .

		Form in literature , no less than matter , has its street-cries to attract buyers .

		Style is lauded as though it were something separable from thought or art .

		Euphuism and preciosity have their day .

		Such tags of criticism as '' the inevitable phrase , '' '' the juste mot '' '' distinction , '' '' nuance '' and a dozen more , all perfectly proper in their proper places , are worked to death , forced into an import - ance they do not possess .

		People make a creed out of a claw of Jove 's eagle .

		Some authors go about proclaiming that prose is a finer form of expression than verse .

		Others are wildly sure that the over - loaded and intricate prose of De Quincey or Pater is our final and perfected speech , the large utterance of our future gods .

		Others are all for the uncon - ventional , for the verse run mad of
Blake	PERSON	or Whitman .

		None of these methods or mannerisms of expression are original -- are discoveries of those who preach them .

		All of them have been tried again and again in the progress of literatm-e .

		What are the new ideas that are floating in our air and fated to influence literary creation ?

		One is the idea of the new power of women .

		We talk as if the woman spirit had been confined , like the genie in the brass bottle , for all past ages , and was
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31 now released , and , towering above man who had delivered it , was threatening to destroy him .

		The fable of woman 's imprisonment in the past will hardly bear examination .

		In all times she has had greater leisure , and probably a greater average cul - tivation in the pleasing arts , than man .

		And a long line of poets , prophets , leaders , from
Deborah	PERSON	and
Sappho	PERSON	and
Hypatia	LOCATION	down , star the annals of every race and every age in proportion probably as numer - ous as to-day .

		Taking woman 's work as a whole , I do not see that it has added any distinct or special quality to literature or art .

		Another large and vague idea trying to impose itself on literature is that of democracy .

		What is democracy ?

		I am inclined to think there is no such thing .

		I catch myself writing of middle and lower classes , -- which is silly in an American , for we are all of the middle or lower classes .

		Where there is no rank fixed by law or custom there can be no upper class .

		Such transitory things as wealth or power will not make one .

		But there may be superiors and inferiors , and our whole social system is based upon superiority and inferiority .

		Go where you will , you wiU find people ordering and people obeying -- people looked up to and people looked down upon .

		Every little hamlet , unmarked upon the map , has its king and his circle of courtiers .

		If democracy merely means the free opportunity to rise or fall , then perhaps we have realized it in
America	LOCATION	.

		But this halcyon state is not likely to hold .

		We have evolved tremendous powers which , unless human nature has changed from of old , will sooner or later try to perpetuate themselves .

		Optimism is a habit of mind rather than an idea .

		I do not know whether Americans have more hope and sunny expectations than other races , but we talk and preach them more .

		I think this rose - colored outlook , whatever effect it may have on life itself , is detrimental to literature .

		It banishes tragedy and all great and serious thought .

		It makes our art of all kinds thin and flat and savor - less .

		How are we going to make bricks without straw ?

		-- how produce great effects without great means ?

		-- how project rounded figures without shadow ?

		Our optimism and lack of depth are largely due to our material success , and to the fact that we have never known , as a nation , defeat , des - pair , and crushing grief .

		In a literary way , it has been taught us by
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
New England	LOCATION	prophet is a delightful `` friend of the spirit , '' but the attempt to build either great lives or great books out of his preachments would be like carrying out smoke in a hand-basket .

		Is there , then , ever anything new in literature ?

		or do the same old waves rise and recede as the moon guides its retinue around the earth ?

		There is this : the individual spirit and gift of each new wi'iter .

		In Goethe 's '' Italian Journey '' he de - scribes how he was once taken at night , with a party of artists , to the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, to see the statues by torch - light .

		He describes the wonderful effects of the flashing torches upon the marble figures -- altering , contorting , making them alive .

		The great statues of humanity , the circling background of nature , always exist the same .

		But each one of us has a uniquely burning , differently colored torch , which we flash upon these permanent forms .

		As we choose , we can concentrate its light upon some noble head with serene brow and solemn eyes ; or we can direct it upon the laboring limbs , or animal portions of the figure .

		We can let one statue stand out , while all the rest are swathed in darkness ; or we can move our light rapidly about and set the whole company in confused motion .

		We can reveal the central group of humanity , or we can illuminate the background of nature .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	's '' change of ownership is almost as startling , not to say disconcerting , as would be a shifting of the sun 's place of rising to some other part of the horizon .

		However , it is not probable that the motions of the heavenly bodies will be affected by the disappearance of the familiar
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	and
Mifflin	LOCATION	imprint from the title-page of the magazine so long issued by that firm and by its predecessors ; and this can be predicted the more confidently because the place of publication -- No. 4 Park Street ,
Boston	LOCATION	-- will re - main unchanged .

		While Park Street Church and the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' office withstand the ravages of time and progress , all is not lost .

		The new publishers , as we have already announced , are incoi-porated under the name of
The Atlantic Monthly Company	ORGANIZATION	, with Mr.
Ellery Sedgwick	PERSON	as president , Mr.
Waldo Emerson Forbes	PERSON	as vice-president , and Mr.
MacGregor Jenkins	PERSON	as treasurer .

		There we have at least five good
New England	LOCATION	names as a sort of guaranty that the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' quality is not to suffer detriment .

		Further to reassure us , we are told that Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	will retain the editorship .

		It is also promised by the publishers that the magazine '' will steadily broaden its scope and pur - poses '' -- words of doubtful omen , one might fear , with a dread suggestion of `` special features , '' illustrations -LRB- perhaps in color ! -RRB-

		and who knows what besides !

		But all such alarm is groundless , no doubt , and '' the Amer - ican Blackwood '' will continue its decorous course , we may hope , to the edification and uplifting of generations yet unborn .

		.

		, ,
Cleveland	LOCATION	as a phrase-maker , as the author of certain terse and unforgettable expressions , will enjoy a fame distinct from , and perhaps as lasting as , his renown as a statesman . ''

		A public office is a public trust '' we owe to him . ''

		Innocuous desuetude '' has long since passed into popular speech , as also '' It is a condition which confronts us -- not a theory . ''

		It was
Cleveland	LOCATION	who considered '' the pension list of the republic a roll of honor , '' and declared that '' party honesty is party expediency . ''

		Only four years ago , in his characterization of Judge
Parker	PERSON	, then candidate for the presidency , as '' safe , sane , and undramatic , '' he hit on a happy collocation of adjectives that ran so trippingly upon the tongue as to delight his hearers .

		In the utterance of his opinion on the eligibility of a pres - ident for reelection , he spoke severely of the '' horde of office-holders , with a zeal born of benefits received and 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, fostered by the hope of favors yet to come '' ; and he elsewhere referred to the gratitude of politicians as derived from '' a lively expectation of favors to come . ''

		Perhaps he had been reading
Walpole	LOCATION	as quoted by
Hazlitt	PERSON	in his '' Wit and Humour , '' -- '' The gratitude of place-expectants is a lively sense of future favors . ''

		And doubtless , also , he was familiar with
Rochefou	PERSON	- cauld 's often-repeated maxim , '' The gratitude of most men is but a secret desire of receiving greater benefits . ''

		But truisms did not suffer in his phrasing .

		Like Lincoln , he had a faculty of making '' home-truths seem more true , '' and of putting a fundamental truth into apt words that linger in the memory .

		• • • The starting of an epoch-making newspaper was fitly commemorated a few days ago by the placing of a bronze memorial tablet on the office building that has recently arisen at the northeast corner of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and
Water Streets	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The tablet is thus inscribed : On this spot
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON	PERSON	began the publication of `` The Liberator ''
January 1 , 1831	DATE	.

		In a small chamber , friendless and unseen .

		Toiled o'er his types one poor , unlearned young man ; The place was dark , unfumitured and mean .

		Yet there the freedom of a race began .

		Begun without capital or subscribers , and printed from borrowed or hired type , the venturesome journal was kept going by the
night	TIME	labors of its editor and founder , and of his devoted partner in the desperate enterprise ,
Isaac Knapp	PERSON	.

		The tablet , bearing as it does the open - ing stanza of
Lowell	LOCATION	's fine poem '' To
W. L. Garrison	PERSON	, '' serves well to supplement the earlier memorial on
Commonwealth Avenue	ORGANIZATION	, which is in the form of a statue of Garrison , its pedestal inscribed with the motto of his paper , '' My Country is the World ; my Countrymen are all
Mankind	LOCATION	, '' and also with his declaration , as printed in the first number : '' I am in earnest ; I will not equiv - ocate ; I will not excuse ; I will not retreat a single inch , and I will be heard . ''

		Manuscript reproduction by rotograph , the technical details of which hardly come within our province , appears to be a not unsatisfactory solution of an old problem , -- namely , how to make widely available the manuscript treasures of those European and other libraries and historical museums that are the fortunate possessors of these precious relics .

		From
Western Reserve University	ORGANIZATION	word reaches us that the library there has recently acquired a rotograph facsimile of a
Worcester Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	manuscript , and that the script , standing out boldly in white on a black ground , is in many places , where the original has suffered injury , even more legible , more sharply defined , than the manuscript itself .

		Rotography is said now to be satis - factorily executed by the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	, and the fac - similes thus produced are not thought any more trying to the eyes than are the originals .

		American students unable to visit European libraries and archives , but desiring access to mediaeval manuscripts , are likely to profit greatly by the new process of reproduction , especially since the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	has concerted measures for cooperative work among public libraries of this country whereby rotographs of all the most important manuscripts consulted by scholars will in time , it is hoped , be available to American students who are within reach of any of the cooperating libraries .

		The Passing of '' Uncle Remus '' brings sadness to his thousands of readers and admirers .

		Our '' Amer - ican iEsop '' was a most lovable character , with none of the biting , sardonic quality of his Greek prototype .

		His negro dialect stories , rich in folklore but delightfully free from the dreary dryness of much that is published under that name , are full of laughter and sunshine and light-heartedness .

		The irresponsible , happy-go-lucky son of
Africa	LOCATION	has been with us , in abundance , for gen - erations ; but he waited for a
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	to catch and reproduce his peculiar charms and graces .

		There have been many imitators , but the creator of '' Uncle Remus '' Temains facile princeps .

		To the
Atlanta	LOCATION	'' Constitution , '' or rather to
Evan Howell	PERSON	, long its able editor , is due the credit of discerning and encouraging
Harris	PERSON	's native genius .

		It was in the columns of that newspaper that the earlier plantation stories appeared , side by side with editorial matter of a more serious nature which the versatile young journalist could so acceptably produce .

		And now he is cut off in the flower of his manhood , in his sixtieth year , and with him is silenced not only
Uncle Remus	PERSON	, but we fear also ''
Uncle Remus	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		• • • The psychology of reading has been discussed of late , chiefly apropos of a learned work setting forth the results of extended investigation in this department of intellectual activity .

		Rapid readers , it is now alleged , are likely to be also quick at fig ^ es , and vice versa , -- which is not surprising .

		A literary worker , having need of a reader to digest a vast amount of printed matter for him , chose , after examinmg a number of candidates , the one who was readiest at solving arithmetical prob - lems .

		One queries whether that quick-witted person , with all his capacity for rapid assimilation of others ' writings , had any literary talent of his own .

		How many great authors there have been who were self - confessedly deficient in mathematical ability , some of them being apparently floored by the simplest problem in pounds , shillings , and pence , especially where their ovm exchequer was concerned .

		The lover of good lit - erature who professes to have gone through fourteen volumes of Parkman in one year , by reading him but ten minutes a day , is either an unusually rapid reader or an inaccurate counter of minutes ; for the time spent on each volume , at ten minutes a day , figures itself out to be four hours and twenty minutes , and the necessity of fixing the attention and getting up speed for only so short a period at a time greatly increases the difficulty of the alleged achievement .

		But this reader may have extraordinary powers of mental concentration .

		Park - man 's works , fascinating as they are , do not exactly fall within the class of light reading .

		Book-backs as educators are not held in high esteem by Librarian
Willcox	PERSON	of the
Peoria Public Li	LOCATION	- brary .

		In a paper read at
Minnetonka	LOCATION	at the recent gathering of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	he de - clares himself strongly opposed to allowing the public to roam at large through the library stack-room , gazing , for the most part in idle curiosity , at the backs of books , or handling the volumes so ungently as to arouse apprehensions lest before long the whole library will be '' thumbed out of existence , '' as Mr.
John Thomson	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	has expressed it .

		THE DIAL 33 aid and advice from intelligent and nimble assistants , is attractively presented .

		It is probable that this vexed question of how far the public should be trusted by the custodians of books will be discussed as long as libra - rians continue to convene and to read papers ; and it is also not improbable that the discussions will take their tone largely from the age and temperament of the participants , those saddened and made wiser by years of experience being generally opposed to the removal of locks and bars , and the young and sanguine and youth - fully optimistic lifting their voices in favor of a more magnanimous and generous and imsuspicious policy .

		Mr.
WiUcox	PERSON	, with all his energy and progressiveness , is , in point of years , one of our older librarians .

		A WARKING TO VIOLATORS OF LIBRARY RULES may be read in the issue of the late
Harvard	LOCATION	-
Yale	ORGANIZATION	boat-race .

		The very powers above that rule over the destinies of nations and the fortunes of inter-collegiate sports have declared themselves on the side of the vigilant librarian and the inexorably-just president of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, one of whom caught two members of the crew in the act of removing from the library precincts , without due per - mission , a book that they desired to peruse in privacy , while the other official punished this infraction of the rules by suspending the offenders and -LRB- as a conse - quence of the suspension -RRB- incapacitating them for taking part in the great aquatic contest of the season .

		Protests and prayers , beating of breasts and shedding of tears , with dire forebodings of ignominious defeat at
New London	LOCATION	, followed upon this punitive edict , and a green and yellow melancholy settled over
Cambridge	LOCATION	-- and over the
White House	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		But lo !

		when the fateful day arrived , the boat thus deprived at the last moment of its stoutest oarsmen , but purged of its sin of book-misappropriation , swept proudly to the goal far in the lead of its rival .

		How pleased must then have been that librarian and that president , who could not love their college so much loved they not honor more !

		• • • Books by multimillionaires are not yet so numer - ous that the appearance of a new one can pass unnoted .

		Mr.
John D. Rockefeller	PERSON	's forthcoming autobiography is sure to be read for many reasons that will in no way relate to its literary excellence .

		It is announced that the
October	DATE	number of '' The World 's Work '' will contain the first instalment of this life of the greatest of money-makers ; and the appearance in book form of the completed work , after it has run its course in the magazine , is a foregone conclusion .

		A query that may suggest itself to some is this : What honorariiun that will not look too insignificant for acceptance will the magazine publishers offer to this man of imcounted millions ?

		That he will receive a check for some amount is to be assumed , little though he needs it .

		Why would it not be a good plan for him and his millionaire associates in authorship -- Messrs.
Carnegie	PERSON	,
Lawson	PERSON	, and
William Waldorf Astor	PERSON	-- to devote the earnings of their pens to the establishment of a fund for the relief or encouragement of impecunious writers ?

		• • • Revision of copyright laws is asked for by the
International Congress of Publishers	ORGANIZATION	lately in session at

		A resolution was adopted that the confer - ence to be held next

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- The full and complete protection of authors and composers against the reproduction of their works by means of mechanical instruments of all kinds .

		The delegates from
Germany	LOCATION	favored , in the third clause , a period of thirty instead of fifty years .

		But why thirty , or fifty , or any other fixed number of years ?

		Shall the products of the intellect , the things that are unseen and eternal , be treated with less respect , safe - guarded less jealously , than the things that are seen and temporal ?

William Blake	PERSON	-- Poet , Artist , AND Man .

		* In his day ,
William Blake	PERSON	had a few ardent admirers ; by the middle of the nineteenth cen - tury he was to the world at large little more than a vaguely remembered name .


William Allingham	PERSON	recorded in his diary , in
August , 1849	DATE	: ''
British Museum Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Pat	PERSON	- more .

		He helps me look up
Blake	PERSON	, but without success ; they seem to have nothing of his . ''

		Ten years earlier .

		Dr.
James Garth Wilkinson	PERSON	had republished '' Songs of Innocence and Experience . ''

		With the exception of his early '' Poetical Sketches , '' this was the only one of
Blake	PERSON	's books that had then been printed from type .

		The others had been struck off from the plates engraved by him , and had always been scarce .

		Occasionally at this period copies of them found their way into the second-hand bookshops ; and Mr.
Evans	PERSON	, a printseUer in Great Queen Street , acquired a large collection of
Blake	ORGANIZATION	's drawings , which
Allingham	PERSON	and
Rossetti	PERSON	went to see in the
summer of 1857	DATE	.

		Rescued from this semi-oblivion by the pub - lication of
Gilchrist	ORGANIZATION	's biography in
1863	DATE	, fol - lowed five years later by
Swinburne	PERSON	's appreciative work ,
Blake	PERSON	has become the subject of a cult which has steadily grown and has yielded an abundant crop of critical essays , new editions of his poems , and interpretations of his '' Prophetic Books . ''

		With bland assurance born of tower - ing egotism ,
Blake	PERSON	always claimed to be a genius .

		That the world now accepts him at his own estimate is shown , we are told , by the high prices his drawings , engravings , and the books of poetry illuminated by his hand , or that of his wife , now fetch in the market .

		Such , at least , is the statement made by Mr.
Edwin J. EUis	PERSON	in '' The Real
Blake	PERSON	. ''

		This book , styled by its author '' a portrait biog - raphy , '' and intended as a tribute to the memory of
Blake	PERSON	and an explanation of the meanings hidden in his poems , is an extraordinary perform - ance .

		From one end to the other it is crammed with facts , real or alleged , animadversions upon other writers and other editors of

		dense forest thickly crowded with underbrush .

		Plainly , the author has fallen a victim to his own enthusiasm .

		No one else , he thinks , knows Blakes writings as he does , or understands him so well , or has so fully penetrated aU the subtle - ties of his philosophy .

		Neither Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	nor Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	nor Mr.
Gilchrist	PERSON	may be trusted ; and as for Mr.
Sampson	PERSON	, why , in his edition of ''
Blake	PERSON	's Poetical Works '' he `` gave his whole attention to verbal accuracy , '' and the volume , in the opinion of Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	, is '' empty of interpretation or intelligent poetic study . ''

		If Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	had himself paid more attention to verbal accuracy in printing excerpts from
Blake	PERSON	's writings , the value of his book would have been considerably enhanced .

		Instead , the text of the '' Descriptive Catalogue '' is given with
Gilchrist	PERSON	's emendations ; the '' Public Address '' and the descriptions of the picture of '' The Last Judgment '' follow the Quaritch edition , and repeat its errors ; and the marginal notes to
Swedenborg	PERSON	,
Lavater	PERSON	, and
Reynolds	PERSON	-LRB- nowhere else given so fully -RRB- are also marred by misprints .

		As for interpretation , it can hardly be said that Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	has done much to penetrate the obscurity of
Blake	PERSON	's mystic utter - ances .

		Of speculation there is a supei'abund - ance , and it is put forth with an air of certainty that waves aside all differences of opinion as not well grounded .

		To round out the picture ' of '' the real Blake '' as conceived by Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	, there is even the recital of minute details of
Blake	ORGANIZATION	's life which could only have been dis - covered through the exercise of '' second sight '' more wonderful than
Blake	PERSON	's prophetic vision .

		So deeply has Mr. EUis delved -LRB- in imagin - ation -RRB- into
Blake	PERSON	's mental processes , that he makes him incapable of revising his own work . ''

		There were two Blakes , '' he teUs us , '' and they could not edit one another . ''

		Yet this very statement is prefaced by an elaborate exposition of the lines from '' Vala '' : '' Saying , that I had never drunk the wine nor eat the bread Of dark mortality , nor cast my eyes into futurity , nor turned My back , darkening the present , clouding with a cloud . ''

		The second line , originally written `` Of dark mortality , nor cast my eyes into the west , nor turned , '' was changed by
Blake	PERSON	to '' Of dark mortality , nor cast ray eyes into the futurity , nor turned , '' as Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	points out ; whereupon he goes on to say '' it should obviously read '' '' Of dark mortality , cast eyes into futurity , '' and the next line should be changed to '' Nor turned my back dark ` ning the present , clouding with a cloud , ''

		THE DIAL 35 and he laments that these lines were not so printed in the Quaritch edition of
Blake	PERSON	's poet - ical works which he edited in collaboration with Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	.

		Evidently '' the real
Blake	PERSON	'' is visible only through the fog of an
Ellis	PERSON	mod - ification !

		The presentation would have more reality were not
Blake	PERSON	's work as an artist vir - tually ignored .

		In spite of its shortcomings , however , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's book has distinct value for those who care to make an exhaustive study of
Blake	PERSON	's poems ; but to separate the wheat from the chaff calls for the expenditure of much time and patiepce .

		From this involved and laborious effort , it is a pleasure to turn to Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	's compact , lucid , and orderly volume .

		Here we get at least a comprehensive view of
Blake	PERSON	as poet , artist , and man , and something like intel - ligent appreciation and criticism .

		The task Mr.
Symons	PERSON	set himself , of giving his '' own narra - tive , containing , as briefly as possible , every fact of importance of what I took to be
Blake	PERSON	's achievements and intentions , '' has been excel - lently performed , and has been supplemented by the reprint of every personal account of
Blake	PERSON	printed during his lifetime , and , what is of real value , the complete text of every refer - ence to
Blake	PERSON	in
Crabb Robinson 's Diary	ORGANIZATION	.

		Working in true scholarly spirit , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	has not been content to take his facts at second-hand ; and after considerable research , and examination of parish registers and other sources of information , the theory put forth by Dr.
Carter Blake	PERSON	, and accepted by Messrs.
Ellis	PERSON	and
Yeats	PERSON	, that
Blake	PERSON	's grandfather was an Irishman named
John O'Neil	PERSON	, who changed his name on marrying
Ellen Blake	PERSON	, is dismissed as unsupported by a particle of documentary evidence .

		With dry details of this sort , however , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	is not overmuch concerned .

		They can not be ignored , nor yet taken for granted ; but they occupy little space in his book .

		Except in one respect , and that a most im - portant one , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	's analysis of
Blake	PERSON	's character and of his art leaves nothing to be desired .

		The finer shades are set forth with sympathy and understanding , which is perhaps the more subtly penetrating because of the flaw in his own philosophy that prevents him from reaching conclusions that are quite irrefragible .

		Overcome by the potency of
Blake	PERSON	's thought , deeply impressed by his mental vigor , his abso - lute freedom from the trammels of conventional ideas of any sort , and his overwhelming imagina - tion , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	is led to place an exaggerated estimate upon the value of
Blake	PERSON	's work con - sidered as art . ''

		It is , '' he asserts , '' by his energy and nobility of creation that
Blake	PERSON	takes rank among great artists . ''

		But in art it is not what is done , but how it is done , that makes the difference ; and measured by that infallible test ,
Blake	PERSON	's art falls somewhat short of greatness .

		Disturbed by some glimmering of this truth , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	endeavors to get around it by a clever bit of special pleading : '' There can hardly be a poet who is not conscious of how Uttle his own highest powers are under his own control .

		The creation of beauty is the end of art , but the artist should rarely admit to himself that such is his purpose .

		A poem is not written by the man who says : I will sit down and write a poem ; but rather by the man who , captured by rather than capturing an impulse , hears a tune which he does not recognize , or sees a sight which he does not remember , in some * close comer of his brain , ' and exerts the only energy at his disposal in recording it faithfully , in the medium of his particular art .

		And so in every creation of beauty , some obscure desire stirred in the soul , not realized by the mind for what it was , and , aiming at most other things in the world than pure beauty , produced it .

		Now , to the critic this is not more important to remem - ber than it is for him to remember that the result , the end , must be judged , not by the impulse which brought it into being , nor by the purpose which it sought to serve , but by its success or failure in one thing : the creation of beauty . ''

		Unfortunately , Mr.
Symons	PERSON	does not always remember .

		He sees clearly that what
Blake	PERSON	gives us in his pictures '' is not a picture after a mental idea ; it is the literal delineation of an imaginative vision , '' and that what is unsatisfy - ing in them is attributable to '' his dependence on a technique not as flexible as his imagination . ''

		What he does not perceive is that such beauty as may be found in
Blake	PERSON	's designs is almost solely beauty of idea ; that they fail lamentably in the fundamental qualities of composition of line and mass which inevitably characterize all graphic art that may properly be labelled '' great . ''

		But to the consideration of
Blake	PERSON	as a poet he brings an unclouded vision , and it would be difficult indeed to express the truth more admirably than in such words as these : '' Just as , in the designs which his hand drew as best it could , according to his limited and partly false knowl - edge , from the visions which his imagination saw with perfect clearness , he was often unable to translate that vision into its real equivalent in design , so in his attempts to put these other mental visions into words he was ham - pered by an equally false method , and often by remi - niscences of what passed for ' picturesque ' writing in the work of his contemporaries .

		He was , after all , of his time , though he was above it , and just as he only knew Michelangelo through bad reproductions , and could never get his own design wholly free , malleable , and virgin to his ' shaping spirit of imagination , ' so , in spite of all his marvellous lyrical discoveries , made when his mind was less burdened by the weight of a controlling 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, message , he found himself , when he attempted to make an intelligible system out of the ' improvisations of the spirit , ' and to express that system with literal accuracy , the half-helpless captive of formal words , conventional rhythms , a language not drawn direct from its source .

		Thus we find , in the Prophetic Books , neither achieved poems nor an achieved philosophy . ''

		No other writer has , on the whole , given a better picture of this strange genius , often childish , and yet so advanced in his ideas that his contemporaries thought him mad .

		In an interesting comparison between
Blake	PERSON	and
Nietzsche	PERSON	, the salient fact is brought out that it is not so much as an artist , nor as a poet , but as a thinker , that
Blake	PERSON	was truly great .

		Altogether Mr.
Symons	PERSON	has given us a book that we could not well spare , even though we may not be able to accept all his contentions .

		Miss
Gary	PERSON	's '' The Art of
William Blake	PERSON	'' is chiefly valuable for the reproductions it con - tains of more than fifty of his designs , a number of which , from his manuscript sketch-book , are now published for the first time .

		The essay by which these are prefaced is a bit of unrestrained eulogy .

		The claim made for
Blake	PERSON	that '' No one has more clearly understood the relation between a decorative design and the space it has to fill '' is so preposterous as to destroy con - fidence in the author 's dicta about other phases of his art .

		Miss
Gary	PERSON	's book about Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's art was so sane that it is surprising to find her departing from the firm ground upon which she stood in writing that work and falling into the error of judging art by the content rather than the form .

		Were '' the flaming inner soul of invention '' the one vital thing in art , then
Blake	PERSON	's crude drawings would deserve the most lavish encomiums .

		But their appeal is to the intellect , leaving the aesthetic sense immoved ; and thus they furnish an object - lesson for which it would be difficult to find a parallel .

		in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, ' but vulgarity triumphed over piety . ''

		Many wiU appreciate , perhaps sympa - thize with , the action , though few may refer it to the same source .

		But though people do not go much to the theatre in the
summer	DATE	, they are not averse to talking about the plays they have seen during the season .

		I have , therefore , little hesitation in taking an opportunity that offered itself some time ago , of writing something about two plays that are now subject for literary crit - icism , if only by virtue of having appeared in paper and print .

		One of these is '' The Servant in thp
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' mentioned by the letter - writer just quoted .

		This play has been widely and favorably advertised by the best kind of advertising -- namely , the admiring word of those who have seen it ; so that many who have had no chance to see it will have an interest in reading it .

		Whether they will conceive of it -LRB- with our friend above quoted -RRB- as a pious performance , I can not guess ; I rather think that the implication of piety is apt to distract the mind from other matters of more dramatic import . ''


Ben Hur	PERSON	, '' for in - stance , '' The Ghristian , '' and whatever may have been the next to the last play which inspired delighted clergymen to prophesy con - cerning the service of the stage to religion , these have not made great contributions to the liter - ature of our tongue , however much they may have added to our piety . ''

		The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' has one thing that a great play shoidd have -- namely , a noble aim , that of presenting in a form that will impress the heart and mind of our genera - tion the spirit of
Jesus Ghrist	PERSON	as it may appear in modern life .

		This is a thing that some people disapprove of and call hard names ; but I see no necessity for feeling in any such way .

		It is an aim that has appeared several times in recent art with very interesting results ; the pictures of
Fritz von Uhde	PERSON	, for instance , which seem to me very touching and beautifid , as well as those of various Frenchmen whose names I do not remember .

		The writers of fiction , how - ever , whether in the novel or the drama , have not often dealt with the subject , at least not in the same way .

		There have been examples on the modern stage , however , and one of them has just appeared -- a translation of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's play , ''
Hannele	PERSON	's Himmelfahrt . ''

		This play of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's I used to think his masterpiece .

		Not having read his work for some years , I am not sure but that he may not of late have written something better : he is an erratic genius , and often produces fine things
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 almost , it would seem , by accident .

		But whether the best of his plays or not , ''
Hannele	PERSON	'' is a very beautiful piece , and Mr.
Meltzer	PERSON	has done well to translate it .

		The version was made fourteen years ago , when '' Hannele '' was given -LRB- for a few nights , I believe , perhaps only one -RRB- in
New York	LOCATION	, in the presence of its author .

		I have not heard of its being given in English since , although the acting rights in
America	LOCATION	belong to Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	.

		Aside from such matters , however , it is well to have a translation of the play : in the original there is more or less dia - lect , as often in
Hauptmann	LOCATION	, and some other difficulties , and many will get a good idea of the play who would either find it hard in German or else might miss something .

		Mr.
Meltzer	PERSON	's work in this case , as well as in '' The Sunken Bell , '' is good .

		One misses the poet 's touch here and there , but that is inevitable except in translations of the highest order . ''

		Hannele '' is to be mentioned at the same time with '' The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' only because each play presents the spirit of Christ in modern life , in the person of Christ him - self .

		In '' Hannele '' he appears in a vision , although as the play is developed vision and reality so blend into each other that one hardly distinguishes between them .

		In '' The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' ^ e appears as a real person .

		The motive is worked out in two very different ways , yet each gives a chance to contrast the spirit of Christ and the spirit of the world , and each gives a chance to see the effect that Jesus himself might have on the light of the world , were he once more to take human form .

		The great danger , I believe , in all such at - tempts is that one will substitute conventional sentiment for reality of emotion .

		This danger is one that we may suppose
Hauptmann	PERSON	had clearly in mind ; for he was in his earlier days most noteworthy as a realist .

		The means by which he avoids the difficulty in '' Hannele '' is by presenting the actual facts with absolute realism .

		The almshouse and the paupers , the poor sick child and her low father , the school - master and the deaconess , -- these are actual persons , no different from anyone else .

		The ap - pearance of Jesus , of the angels , of the mother , though it mingles entirely with the reality , yet preserves its own sincerity by having its rise in the fevered fancies of the dying child .

		This is a most ingenious means , for as one reads the play one accepts readily conventional sentiment , even childish fancy , knowing that such are the forms in which the spirit of Christ often mani - fests itself to-day .

		Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	deals with the problem in a different way : he appears to present Jesus as having taken the form of a servant and mingling as a man with the actual life of a family at a very critical time .

		This is a much more difficult matter than that of
Hauptmann	PERSON	: in '' Hannele '' we need never rise beyond mans idealizations of Christ ; in '' The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' the author should pre - sent to us Christ himself .

		That the greater master should accomplish better an easier task , goes without saying . ''

		Hannele '' has already been given by good judges a very high place in the modern drama .

		I believe that a great number who have seen '' The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' will judge that Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	has succeeded equally well ; there can be but little doubt that as the play appears on the stage the impression is strong , powerful , very much what the author desired .

		As one reads the play , however , such is by no means the case : it will possibly be no concern to the author that this should be so ; he wrote for the stage and lie has succeeded on the stage .

		Still he has also printed his play , and we may there - fore consider it as it comes to us .

		My own view of it may be summarized in a very few words , namely , that though intention and idea and means are alike fine and well conceived , the worked-out result is conventional , sentimental , and unreal .

		That is to say , we have hardly an approximation to what Jesus Christ would be were he a servant in a modern family , and we have no real presentation of the spirit of Christ in modern life .

		An English vicar and his wife expect a new butler recommended by a friend in
India	LOCATION	.

		When he appears he bring a new and potent element into the life of the vicarage .

		He detects the page in stealing jam ; he vivifies the imagination and thoughts of a little girl ; he condemns a simoniac prince of the church ; he arouses to a feeling for the higher socialism a low and wretched laboring man ; he restores to his better self the vicar who has long been living a life he knew was not right ; he even inspires a worldly religious woman .

		Why is not all of this well ?

		Some of it certainly is .


Manson	PERSON	's dealing with the page-boy and the little girl is excellent ; even with the wealthy bishop he is good .

		But I can not see why in arranging the play it was necessary to have all the melodrama of a brother who had wronged a brother , a worldly woman using religion for her own purposes , a church built over a charnel-house , a socialist drain-cleaner who shoiild arouse the unfaithful vicar to a hectic self-sacrifice .

		I can not believe 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, that Jesus would manifest himself most charac - teristically in any such surrounding .

		In fact , such a surrounding is most unreal and conven - tional : the high-pitched actions of such people are merely sentimental fancies .

		When the vicar resolves to put away the superficial religion that has made him celebrate the Holy Communion in an empty church every morning , and join the drain-man in clearing out an old charnel-house under the church in spite of the curious danger of typhoid that lurks there , when that happens in the book -LRB- however it be on the stage -RRB- one is not moved except to vexation at one 's disappoint - ment .

		Jesus did not manifest himself , so far as we know , in any such piece of melodrama .

		His acts were impressive , but not spectacular .

		He made his striking impressions -LRB- if we omit cases of disease and possession -RRB- on rather ordi - nary occasions -- on a woman at a well , on a woman who had been tried for adultery , on a man who wished to talk over theological matters with him , or on a man who felt his own crooked dealing condemned by
Jesus	ORGANIZATION	's integrity .

		And these people he impressed , not by righting family wrongs or by unveiling official cor - ruptions , but by contrasting the selfish person - alities in them with the wonderful spirituality that was in him .

		Of course Jesus wished the world to be good rather than bad , but his mis - sion did not consist merely in telling people to be good : it consisted chiefly in showing how to be good , and making it possible .

		Doubtless Jesus to-day woidd rebuke the simonist as harshly as he did the pharisee ; he would con - demn a hard-hearted brother or sister now as sternly as he did in his days on earth .

		But the true spirit of Christ does not manifest itself most characteristically in these ways .

		The whole thing in a nutshell lies , perhaps , in the fact that
Manson	PERSON	is not really a servant in the house , but a bishop .

		In fact , the play is , or might be , a bit of a masquerade : the Bishop of
Benares	LOCATION	disguises himself as an Indian butler , and straightens out the crookednesses of an English family .

		There is no reason for per - sonifying Christ : any bishop as clever as the Bishop of
Benares	LOCATION	could certainly have done about as well .

		Nor is
Manson	PERSON	a personification of
Christ	LOCATION	, for he has no more resemblance to him than many good men in the world , and not nearly so much as some .

		All , this will not lead one to think that Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	's play is without interest .

		It is a fine failure , as many other things worth reading have been .

		There is much ingenious and striking use of the dramatic means chosen -- as in the excellent dramatic irony , for instance ; in fact , there is quite enough to render the reading of the play interesting and amusing .

		The little girl , the rich bishop , are good figures .

		The whole play is impressive on the stage ; at least , so everybody says .

		One may perhaps be satis - fied with that : certainly many plays are not even so much .

		Still , when a man really aims high , one is naturally anxious that he shall hit the mark .

		Very fine things are rare enough in the art of our day ; perhaps Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	will accomplish one when he writes another play .


Edward E. Hale	PERSON	, Jr. .

		The Versatility op Psychology .

		* The chance that assembles upon the reviewer 's table a trio of volumes with such distinctive titles as '' The Animal Mind , '' '' Mind in the Making , '' and '' On the Witness Stand '' may profitably serve to point the moral and adorn the tale of the modern psychology of the laboratory .

		Pro- fessor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	, the writer of the last - mentioned book , finds it pertinent to inform the public in regard to the very significant strides which Psychology -- at once the oldest and the youngest of the sciences -- has taken under the incentive of the modern spirit . ''

		There are about fifty psychological laboratories in the
United States	LOCATION	alone .

		The average educated man has hitherto not noticed this .

		If he chances to hear of such places , he fancies that they serve for mental healing , or telepathic mysteries , or spiritistic performances . ''

		It is indeed impor - tant that the public should maintain an intel - ligent and sympathetic understanding of what psychologists are and do and purpose .

		The popular misconception of the trend as of the inspiration of such endeavors , that associates it with , mystery and an aggressive attack upon the supernatural , is nothing short of a calamity ; and it is so not mainly because it imposes upon the psychologist the discipline of suffering fools gladly , but because it deprives him of a ready and comprehensive communion with his profes - sional colleagues and the wider colleagueship of earnest and sturdy students .

		It will no longer do for psychology to plead its infancy and hide behind a pinafore .

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 career that earns the epithet of `` so young . ''

		No more effective method of coming to its own can be prescribed for psychology than on the one hand to assume fearlessly the reconstruction of the domain that it rightly commands , and again to assert its practical bearing upon the issues that engage thoughtful men .

		It is not only strange , as Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	remarks , it is equally unfortunate , '' that this whole won - derful development should have gone on in com - plete detachment from the problems of practical life . ''

		The task of the theorist and the practitioner must be re-stated , to meet the needs of each progressive generation .

		The comment is an old one , that
Providence	LOCATION	did not first fashion man as he was and then leave it to Aristotle to make him logical .

		Mankind has ever held and will ever hold all sorts and conditions of opinions in regard to the ways of mind ; and the psychol - ogist 's instructions must be content to shape the susceptible habits of the cultivated , and that too in modest measure .

		It truly has not been left for the psychologist to make man psychological .

		He is so because the whole realm of the mind touches deeply his natural interests .

		It is the privilege and the duty of psychology to guide these interests wisely , to free them of supersti - tions and misleading accretions , to inform them with the sterling issues of sound evidence , to enlighten practice with a reverent hesitation and yet not enfeeble it with the pale cast of helpless erudition .

		The attitude of man toward the mental qualities of the animal world offers a suggestive criterion of his status as a psychologist when thrown upon his impulses and chastened by the logic of experience .

		It was a natural appercep - tion of the animal mind to make it the vehicle of the moral fable .

		The primitive man feels his kinship with the other denizens of creation , and envies each for a distinctive quality .

		We still use animal epithets as the most effective appraisals and disparagements of strength and frailty alike .

		The difficulty arises when the scientific conscience is bom , and fact and fable must be held wide apart .

		It makes all sorts of tronble when the modern ^ sop sends his narra - tive to the
Society for Comparative Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, and the crime of nature-faking is recognized in the revised decalogue .

		The constant and irre - sistible temptation remains to read into animal behavior the motives and mental equipment that accompany oiir own actions .

		To give a critically objective account of what a favorite domestic pet really did is an exercise not to be lightly prescribed ; and the psychologist has slowly but determinedly learned to look aside from the '' anecdotage '' of animal sagacity for his data .

		The laboratory dominates the spirit of inquiry , and after a score of years of patient research founded upon discerning and expert analyses makes possible such a survey as Miss
Washburn	PERSON	of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	presents in her volume on '' The Animal Mind . ''

		It is indeed the first compilation dominated by this perspec - tive , and renders accessible to student as well as to the studious layman the kind of data , the critical interpretation of results , and the source of the guiding principles , that in the modern view are likely to bring some systematic under - standing of animal psychology .

		Mental life implies some form of responsive - ness to the forces resident in the environment , which in turn is evidenced by a change of behavior ; while , concomitantly , we know that there goes on in ourselves some reflective process and we assume a more or less distant analogical counterpart thereof in the lowlier organisms according to their nearness of kin .

		The tech - nique necessary to establish the varieties of sensory experience from amoeba to chimpanzee is quite impressive , the interpretations in even the lowly creatures quite perplexing .

		The complex behavior of wasps invites the most individualistic interpretation ; and yet , while any old-fashioned reference to instinct is ruled out of court , the psychologist retains the con - viction of an underlying consistency of stages of behavior , if only the clue thereto could be dis - covered .

		The proper mode of facilitating this discovery is to subject normal animals to definite situations and see what they do , and how they fail , and what is presumably implied in their actions .

		Yet Nature is not to be ignored , and the reactions must at once proceed upon the basis of a real desire , and involve in their solu - tion activities of a kind provided by the animal equipment .

		Susceptibility to training is not the sole criterion of intelligence .

		The natur - alist still puts forth the startling diversities of behavior that come from observation , and freshly challenges the experimentalist to offer an interpretation .

		The whole situation is an admirable example of the value of logic ; and in this arena , and with such weapons , must the conflict be waged .

		It is a notable triumph of the experimental psychologist to have carried the issue to these terms and to have made his own a territory imperfectly occupied by the naturalist .

		In the course of this procedure he has clarified the significance of mental functions 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, when reduced to their lowest terms , -- a result that generations of less definitely guided re - search would have sought for in vain .

		Such , really , is mind in the making .

		Yet each has an individual mind to shape to adult efficiency ; and once more psychology steps in with another type of equipment to lure unwill - ing data from their hidden source .

		Thfi psy - chology of the human animal in its maturing stages is a sore temptation to the easy-going theorist ; he often exhibits a remarkable digestion for haK-baked hypotheses that would stagger a devotee of sterner sciences more accustomed to the regulated diet of a reflective , even a ruminating , constitution .

		Experimental peda - gogues have somewhat mistaken the character of the advice to prove all things .

		In no realm is the experimental path more thickly set with snares for the unwary ; out of the mouths of ambitious doctors ' theses has emerged wisdom that deduces the curriculum , banishes supersti - tion , squares the circle of our perplexities , and proclaims formula for the salvation of the future .

		In spite of exaggeration and misunder - standing , pedagogical practice has a vital con - nection with the psychology of the laboratory ; and Professor Swift 's book on '' Mind in the Making '' may be cited as an example of ration - ally interpreted experience through which such lessons achieve a worthy status .

		The psychology of learning is a procedure to be illuminated by varieties of tests and is in turn a common factor of the animal and the human mind .

		The close dependence of mental deficiencies upon nervous impairment is again to be determined in the spirit of the clinician .

		The wayward instincts of boys -- in their exaggeration the beginnings of crime -- are to be interpreted in the light of evolutionary status .

		The nature of ability , as concretely tested in this or that type of acquisi - tion , illuminates the central issue of general versus special talent .

		And so , one by one , the more concrete and the more comprehensive questions of the applying psychologist are reviewed in this collection of essays ; and each brings a tangible addition to the insight that can assimilate data while it yet directs their accumulation and dominates their interpreta - tion .

		By some such slow and measured accre - tion will psychology infuse into pedagogical inquiry the caution and the spirit of its own advances .

		But the schoolroom is not life .

		Has psychol - ogy anything to say to the active practitioner ?

		No severer test of the issues could be set than to brine : them to court .

		This Professor
Miin	PERSON	- sterberg does in his volume entitled '' On the Witness Stand '' ; and he does it with a bold - ness that invites admiration not unmixed with concern .

		We are all seekers of truth , and the measure of success of our search is ever pro- nounced upon by judges , -- the criticism of our peers , the approval of the many .

		The bench and the collective acumen of twelve jurymen stand as the machinery for bringing to light the legal truth .

		Here enters the psychology of decep - tion : what if the witness lies , and the defendant denies his guilt !

		Upon this issue of credibility , psychology has an authoritative voice ; and how little or how much one may sympathise with Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's methods and conclu - sions , one may unhesitatingly approve his em - phasis of attention to the problem as a psycho - logical one .

		If once we look at the matter apart from tradition , there is really nothing fore - ordained or inspired in the accidental assemblage of twelve citizens that gives to their verdict any unusual status , especially upon this ever - recurring issue of credibility .

		The pertinent data begin with the establish - ment of the treacherous character of memory and the liability to malobservation under the most sincere desire to judge rightly .

		These are distinct issues presenting conditions of labora - tory study .

		The great variability of testimony , when the objective circumstances are carefully noted by one specifically detailed for such pur - pose , is indeed striking .

		Experimental crimin - ology has gone so far as to precipitate into an academic scene a sudden brawl , with the flash of a pistol , and the consequent command of the professor that all shall prepare for use at the trial a careful statement of what had occurred .

		At the next session of the seminary it is revealed that the whole situation was prearranged , that such are the facts , and lo !

		the deviating reports .

		So much for the imintentional swerving from truth .

		Next comes the psychology of prejudice , of expectation , of desire , of interest These are not neglected in the popular appraisal of testi - mony ; and upon these issues definite experi - ment if judiciously conducted has an illuminating value .

		But the psychology of deception forms the keystone of many a legal arch .

		The tell-tale of the emotions ; the hesitations of a conscience ; the entanglements of fabrication , -- will these reveal their secret ?

		Assuredly not always ; though credibility is constantly judged in terms of just these revelations .

		It is at this stage that Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	offers a distinct test that shall circumvent the deceit of the witness and reveal guilt .

		Instead of an ordeal of mediaeval
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 stupidity or brutality , a refined and insinuating method is introduced by which the defendant goes through a series of associations to set words , the time needed to call up the first suitable re - sponse being noted .

		Most of the words are innocent ; but here and there are introduced words that have a bearing upon the crime .

		The result shows delays , irregularities , hesitations at these points .

		This is but one type of psycho - logical record ; but it may stand as a fair sample .

		What importance shall the court lay upon such findings ?

		While approving the pertinence of raising this issue , psychologists and jurists alike will exhibit considerable hesitation in attaching to the method the high practical availability that is here supported .

		Indeed , some will openly say that this is a crude application of a hasty gen - eralization , itself open to error and influenced by accidental vagaries ; that it smacks of the astrologer , the phrenologist , and the palmist , all of whom had ready formulae for reading char - acter and discovering human faculty .

		It is to be regretted that the mode of stating the case gives more plausibility to these protests than they intrinsically merit .

		But while it can not be said that psychology is altogether ready to solve the problems concerned as they concretely arise , and that it is very desirable to avoid sensational - ism and the too confident heralding of panaceas , yet above all the message of Professor
Miinster	PERSON	- berg 's book is that psychology really has and should have something to say on these topics ; and that message , however much we may object to the words in which it is couched , is worthy of consideration .

		A specific question remains : whether psy - chology does not furnish a means of so altering the mental status as to induce a condition in which deceit and perjury are impossible .

		Why not hypnotise the suspect to get the whole truth and nothing but the truth ?

		And once more , may not the crime have been committed while the defendant was in condition of hypnotic irre - sponsibility ?

		And again , assume that a con - fession has been secured : is it beyond question that the confession is genuine , not induced through suggestion ?

		These are all very real and very perplexing situations to which a cate - gorical yes or no can not be hastily rendered .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	discusses them with much insight ; and they , along with the other situations , indicate that sooner or later the pro- ceedings of court must take into account some of the knowledge that is emerging from the psychological laboratory .

		The versatility of psychology is equally its danger .

		Sciences should present determinable though not invariable contours , -- should have loyalties of allegiance and constitutions under which their policies and measures are formu - lated .

		The science of the mind participates in the descriptive insight that makes the good observer , and finds its material in the wide , wide world .

		It must also be normative , for lives must be regulated ; and the perplexities of motives , impulses , and ideals that go to the regidation of our far from simple life will fur - nish incentive for the further pursuit of this comprehensive discipline , allied by traditions with the oldest of the humanities , by precept and example with the historical unfoldment of civilization , by its modern reconstruction with the logic of science and the ingenuity of experi - mental device .


Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	.

		The Stuarts in
Exile	LOCATION	.

		* Of all the unfortunate dynasties of modem times , none has suffered adversity in greater measure than the family of the Stuarts .

		From the terrible rout at
Solway Moss	PERSON	, in
1542	DATE	, to the merciless slaughter at
Culloden Moor	LOCATION	in
1746	DATE	, its history is a record of almost continuous disaster : the lonely death of broken-hearted
James V.	PERSON	; the long journey to the scaffold of his daughter ,
Mary Stuart	PERSON	; the ignominious death of her grandson
Charles I.	PERSON	and the exile of his wife and children ; the second exile of
James II.	PERSON	; the long pathetic '' reign '' of the landless
James III.	PERSON	; the wasted life of the `` Young Pretender '' ; and the final extinction of the male line with the death of the
Cardinal of York	ORGANIZATION	, -- these events , with their attendant circumstances , form a series of tragedies that probably have no parallel in history .

		No doubt it is this tragic element in the career of the Stuart dynasty that appeals so powerfully to a certain class of historical students ; perhaps , also , the fact that the hostility which always rose where a Stuart ruled has continued after them .

		Historians have not always dealt fairly with these kings :
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's treatment may serve as an illustration .

		But whatever the reason , interest in
Stuart	LOCATION	history still continues and shows no sign of abatement .

		Among the new books in this field are two notable studies in the closing act of the Stuart drama -- the •
James Francis Edward	PERSON	, The Old
Chevalier	PERSON	.

Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, exile of James II .

		and his family , and the vain efforts of the '' Pretenders '' to regain the British crowns .

		A few years ago Mr.
Martin Haile	PERSON	developed a natural interest in '' The Old Chevalier '' while preparing a biography of Queen
Mary	PERSON	of
Modena	LOCATION	, the
Chevalier	ORGANIZATION	's mother .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, on the other hand , dis - covered the possibilities of such a study while tracing the career of the
Chevalier	PERSON	's son .

		Prince
Charles Edward Stuart	PERSON	.

		However , '' The
King	PERSON	over the Water '' seems to be mainly the work of
Miss Alice Shield	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's part being limited , as he tells us , to supervision and con - densation .

		When authors write on the same theme , and draw to a large extent from the same sources , their work will naturally show many points of similarity .

		In the present instance this is strikingly true : in both biographies we have the same favorable picture of the Old Pretender , -- they reveal to us the gentle , pious , sympathetic prince , the very antithesis to the coarse profligate that
Thackeray	PERSON	describes in
Henry Esmond	PERSON	; but they also prove that
James	PERSON	was a man of considerable ability and undoubted personal courage , facts that earlier historians , relying on the statements of an anonymous opponent , have been disposed to deny .

		Both writers have shown clearly the importance of the Stuart pretensions as a factor in eighteenth-century diplomacy .

		Almost every court in continental
Europe	LOCATION	seems to have joined , at some time or other , in treaties or plots that aimed at a Stuart restora - tion ; and the biographers have both tried to tell the story of these intrigues with considerable fulness -- too much so , perhaps , to ensure a sustained interest on the reader 's part .

		But there are also notable differences in the books .

		Miss Shield is interested in the human side of her subject , and gives us a delightful picture of every-day life at
Saiat Germains	LOCATION	and
Urbino	LOCATION	; her work is primarily a biography .

		Mr.
Haile	PERSON	, on the other hand , deals more with
James	PERSON	as pretender to the English crown , with diplomatic intrigues and Jacobite plots .

		On these points his researches seem to have been thorough and complete ; but on many other matters he appears to have contented himself with a priori deductions -- as , for instance , when he tells us that
James III	PERSON	.

		was proclaimed at the palace gates of Saint Germains '' under the title of King of
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Ireland	LOCATION	, the title of King of
France	LOCATION	being for obvious reasons omitted . ''

		The reasons do seem obvious enough ; but
Miss Shield	LOCATION	, who seems to have investigated the matter , asser < `` s positively that the Stuarts , even after they had been reduced to financial dependence on
Louis XIV.	LOCATION	, refused to renounce the French title , and that
James	PERSON	was proclaimed king of
France	LOCATION	as well as of
Britain	LOCATION	.

		The authors have also found it necessary to discuss a number of historical problems of gen - eral interest , and on some of these most inter - esting conclusions have been reached .

		Histo - rians have always suspected that
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	was closely connected with the move - ments preliminary to the Revolution of
1688	DATE	; but perhaps none has seen the revolution as Mr.
HaUe	PERSON	views it -- a vast conspiracy , conceived , planned , and engineered by the Prmce himself .

		Mr.
Haile	PERSON	is also sure that
James II	PERSON	.

		was abso - lutely honest , and had nothing but the cause of religious toleration at heart , when he issued the Declaration of Indulgence .

		Louis XIV .

		is shown to have been not entirely unselfish in his efforts to restore
James	PERSON	; he was willing that he should rule again in
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, but not in
England	LOCATION	.

		Even as early as
1694	DATE	, the Jacobite party , Mr.
Haile	PERSON	believes , `` was many times more numerous than had been the Orange faction in
1688	DATE	. ''

		The failure of James he attributes to the lack of adequate resources .

		The biog - raphers both emphasize Queen
Anne	PERSON	's aversion for the
House	ORGANIZATION	of
Hanover	LOCATION	; and Mr.
Haile	PERSON	, with his usual easy positiveness , states his belief that in
1712	DATE	the Queen was actually taking steps toward a restoration of her nephew to the British thrones .

		The story that
James	PERSON	proved such a dis - appointment to the Scots in
1715	DATE	is discredited ; perhaps he was the one who was most disap - pointed .

		At the same time it seems evident that a heart-sick and ague-stricken Parisian youth was hardly the person to accomplish anything heroic in the winter-locked
Highlands	LOCATION	.

		It is interesting to learn that in
1718	DATE	representatives of such hostile monarchs as
Charles XII	PERSON	.

		and
Peter	PERSON	the Great met in secret conference to dis - cuss joint action in favor of a Stuart restoration , '' and their negotiations continued until broken off by the death of
Charles XII	PERSON	. ''

		The imfor - tunate quarrel between
James	PERSON	and his consort , Queen
Clementina	PERSON	, which alienated so much Jacobite support in
England	LOCATION	-LRB- 1725 -RRB- , is attri - buted by Mr.
Haile	PERSON	, on what seems reliable evidence , to the influence of

		43 family is in both instances one of sympathy .

		Miss Shield 's estimates are , however , the more critical and satisfactory ; she is able to see that
Mary	PERSON	of
Modena	LOCATION	, though an excellent woman , was a poor politician , and that
James III	PERSON	.

		would probably not have made a great ruler .

		The reader is therefore hardly prepared for the poetic eulogy that follows the account of
James	PERSON	's funeral and forms the closing paragraph of the work . ''

		All was over that was mortal .

		The old song was sung ; the last drama of the awful Stuart cycle was played out .

		The cause and its glory remained a banquet - hall deserted , whose lights were fled , whose garlands dead , and all but a httle few and a mournful memory departed .

		But that few -- and that memory !

		Green as the unfading pines of the
Highland	LOCATION	glens , that memory lives forever .

		And for that few !

		-- We fools esteemed their life madness and their end to be utter destruction , but they are numbered among the heroes of all time .

		They stood with great constancy against those that afflicted them , and made no accoimt of their sufferings , and they shone as sparks among the stubble of their sordid , self-seeking age .

		As gold in the fur - nace were they proved , and in time there has come respect to them . ''

		No doubt many of the Jacobites did suffer and suffered heroically ; but general praise like the above is not merited .

		In the story of the movements for Stuart restoration , self-interest figures to an amazing extent .

		The Stuart cause was too often used as a handy weapon with which to strike down an opponent .

		And though the use of this weapon often brought the wielder to poverty and exile , and even to the scaffold , his career is on that account not necessarily heroic .

		The Stuart partisans strove against the overpowering forces of history , and these are as merciless as they are mighty .

Stuart	PERSON	, the Confederate cav - campaif/n .

		airy general , Colonel
John T. Mosby	PERSON	, the famous partisan leader , has written a book entitled ''
Stuart	PERSON	's Cavalry in the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	Cam - paign '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Colonel Mosby objects to the assertion of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's biographers , and other writers , that
Lee	PERSON	's objective when he left
Frederick City	PERSON	was
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, and that he planned to fight there a decisive battle ; that there was a race between the two opposing armies for the possession of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, and that
Lee	PERSON	lost because
Stuart	PERSON	with his cavalry was careering about the country out of touch with the army and not fiu-nishing the commander-in-chief with information about the movements of the Federals .

		Mosby maintains that Lee , by invading
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, meant merely to draw
Hooker	PERSON	out of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and thereby to de - range for the year the Federal plan of campaign , and perhaps also to relieve the pressure in the
Southwest	LOCATION	by causing the withdrawal of troops to the North ; that
Stuart	PERSON	did not neglect the duty of supplying information , but was doing what
Lee	PERSON	had ordered him to do ; that there was no race to reach
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, for Lee had not intended to go there ; that he had planned to fight at Cashtown Pass , if at all ; and that his plans were frustrated by
Heth	PERSON	and Hill , who blundered into a fight at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	when ordered to make only a reconnoissance .

		The author thinks that
Lee	PERSON	had set a trap into which
Hooker	PERSON	was about to fall ; that
Lee	PERSON	wanted him to come out of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and either get so far into
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	that the Confederate army might turn and make a forced march on
Washington	LOCATION	, or if he should divide his army
Lee	PERSON	would then endeavor to destroy it in detail .

		Meade 's succession to the com - mand of the Federal army upset some of Lee 's calculations , for
Meade	PERSON	was not so easily handled as
Hooker	ORGANIZATION	had been .

		Of the battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, there is no account in this book .

		It can not be said that
Colonel Mosby	PERSON	proves all his points ; but he does prove some of them , and throws new light on others .

		Only slight literary skill is displayed , and the arrangement of the matter is anything but com - mendable .

		The entire book of 220 pages has only two chapters , and the arrangement of foot-notes is execrable -- in many places it is difficult to tell whether a quotation belongs in a foot-note or in the text ; sometimes a passage begins as a note and ends as a part of the text , producing a most confus - ing effect .

		The author 's style is over-argumentative , and too often he says disrespectful things of Lee 's staff officers who are responsible for the generally accepted views as to
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's intentions .

		There is much repetition of argument , some mistakes of memory as to names , and too profuse quotation from the
Official Records	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work shows , however , that the author has made a thorough study of military science as bearing on his subject .

		It is but natural for lovers to be LllKfitiil .

Italy	LOCATION	.

		Even when they grow a bit tiresome , a subtle glow of sympathy softens our impatience or makes gentle our smile .

		But some of her countless devotees have really interesting things to tell us and have earned the right to be heard .

		To this fortunate number belongs Mr.
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	.

		In his latest volume of studies in Italian life and letters -LRB- `` Italica , ''
Hough	PERSON	- ton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	has brought together fourteen essays which have appeared in various periodicals since
1893	DATE	.

		The papers have been written with special limits in view , and meet their respective purposes admirably .

		Naturally , there are inequalities of interest ; nor is there any .

		unity save in the most general sense .

		This latter 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, defect , however , may not be felt very strongly , inas - much as the American who is interested in ''
Dante	PERSON	as a Lyric Poet '' is often glad to hear about '' Thirty Years of Italian Progress . ''

		While the reviewer may have enjoyed most the chapters on Cardinal
Hohenlohe	PERSON	and ''
Italy	LOCATION	in
1907	DATE	, '' many of his readers might easily prefer '' Venetian Legends and Pa - geants , '' or some of the literary essays .

		When Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	is dealing with contemporary conditions in the Italian peninsula , we find ourselves in hearty accord with his views .

		Despite the agrarian prob - lems in the South , the nation has every right to be optimistic as it surveys the progress of the last thirty years : in an entirely new sense , the way of hope lies open .

		When Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	deals with questions touching the
Papacy	LOCATION	and Clericalism , he is laudably outspoken ; and here again we are thoroughly in sympathy with his attitude .

		In the literary essays we could find points that are open to respectful criticism .

		For instance , in his readable chapter on
Carducci	PERSON	there is a tone of complaint that this great author has been unduly neglected outside of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		In an important sense , this is hardly true ; for the very merits of that really eminent lyric poet bind him more or less closely to his own nation , and his message might have been fraught with less mean - ing for
Italy	LOCATION	if it had been more general .

		On the whole , however , the reflections and verdicts recorded in the volume are such as we should expect from a student and critic of Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	's standing .

		Newiiahtan ^ ^ o '' ?

		expected work on Stellar the problems of Evolution , by Dr.
George E. Hale	PERSON	, stellar evolution .

		Director of the
Mount WHson Solar Observatory	ORGANIZATION	in
California	LOCATION	, has finally been issued by the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is not a treatise on the general subject of stellar evolution , but rather chiefly a popular description of certain phases of astrophysical research -- illustrated largely by investigations and experiments made by Dr.
Hale	PERSON	and his assistants -- which bear upon the problem of the development of the starry universe .

		The book contains twenty-five chapters , of about ten pages apiece ; a third of them consist of descriptions and discussions of instruments .

		Some of these in - struments have been in use at the
Yerkes Observa	LOCATION	- tory , of which the author was formerly Director , and others are being built for service at Mount WUson .

		The reader gets a new idea of the refine - ments of modern astronomical research , when he is told that a great reflecting telescope , the mirror of which is sixty inches in diameter , is to be maintained at an even teraperatTire throughout the day by the use of suitable refrigerating machinery ; the building in which this optical giant is to be sheltered will be shielded from the direct rays of the sun , and so constructed that no outside air can enter during the day .

		The necessity for such precautions becomes apparent as one learns that when the mirror was being ground to the true paraboloidal figure tests were made which would reveal irregularities of figure as large as one five hundred thousandth of an inch .

		It is impossible in a short notice to give an adequate idea of the contents of a book which discusses subjects ranging from `` The Nebular Hypothesis '' down to '' Opportunities for Amateur Observers . ''

		Of the nebular hypothesis the author concludes that ''
Laplace	LOCATION	's idea of the development of the solar system must be reconstructed or aban - doned . ''

		To the planetesimal hypothesis of the evolution of our system , which has recently been formulated by
Chamberlin	PERSON	and
Moulton	PERSON	, an entire chapter has been given .

		At the end of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's interesting and valuable work are upward of a hun - dred full-page plates , among which are some fine representations of solar phenomena and of notable nebulae ; the majority of them are , however , of novel instruments .

		The volume is an excellent example of fine workmanship in the art of bookmaking .

		Scandinavian Modern-language texts for college texts , annotated Students have multiplied of late years in English .

		^ t such a rate that a large part of the best continental literature has been made avail - able in this annotated form .

		Hitherto , material of this sort has been confined to the four chief culture languages -- German , French , Italian , and Spanish .

		Scandinavian texts , hitherto unrepresented , are now beginning to take their place with those of the other languages , and the
John Anderson Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, is doing useful pioneer work in this direc - tion .

		Three years ago , this house issued a text of
BjOrnson	PERSON	's '' SynnOve Solbakken , '' admirably edited by Professor
George T. Flom	PERSON	; and now we have from the same source no less a work than
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's '' Brand , '' no less admirably edited by Professor
Julius E. Olson	PERSON	.

		In this case , the editor is a pioneer also ; for he has been the fii ` st scholar in any country to undertake the difficult and perplexing task of supplying '' • Brand '' with annotations , and they are almost as much needed by Norwegian as by Amer - ican students .

		We are very grateful for this edition .

		In the first place , it supplies us with an accurate text , and corrects many errors that have crept even into the
Minde Udgave	PERSON	of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		In the second place , it offers a very valuable explanatory introduction , based upon a comprehensive survey of all the sources of information making particular use of the material offered by
Jaeger	PERSON	,
Brandes	PERSON	,
Herford	ORGANIZATION	, and the Ibsen letters , and presenting what seems to us a saner and more balanced view of the work than has elsewhere been published .

		In the third place , it gives us about seventy pages of notes that clear away many difficulties , and provide the reader with an indispensable help to the study of the poem .

		Besides all this , it prints as an appendix
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's verses `` Till de Medskyldige , '' which preface the ' * Brand-Fragment '' of nearly two hundred stanzas , recently unearthed , and published only a few months ago .

		A few sentences from Professor
Olson	PERSON	's Intro - duction may be quoted to illustrate his appreciation of the work which he has edited with so much painstaking . '' '

		Brand ' is the great central fact of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's life and authorship ... The accidental
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 45 theme in hand related to the moral status of his countrymen in an international situation .

		But the fundamental idea of the drama was plucked from his own heart .

		It was written in a spirit of sheer necessity to clarify his own thoughts , -- to cleanse his own soul .

		... It was written at a time when
Ihsen	PERSON	's mind was in a strange ferment , -- a time of terrific storm and stress .

		... In this state of mind , he sought and found refuge in literary production -- in taking under stern literary chastisement a char - acter like himself and allowing him to follow the bent of his intense soul to the limits ... It is a prime artistic virtue of ' Brand ' that it inspires the reader with a kindred heroic spirit . ''

		The familiar The problem of
Rousseau	PERSON	's life and problem of opinions is always fascinating -- for
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		^ ^ g reason , because it is impossible to solve .

		It is obscured by inconsistencies and contra - dictions , by the apparent yet doubtful frankness of amazing confessions , and by the delusions of a dis - ordered mind .

		There is , too , so much in the life of
Rousseau	PERSON	that is likely to bias the investigator , both for and against , that he is liable to become either a special pleader or a criminal prosecutor .

		In
M. Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	's book on
Rousseau	PERSON	-LRB- McClure -RRB- we have the interesting phenomenon of a converted anti-Rousseauite treating the object of his new faith .

		Yet he has not the blind devotion of the proselyte .

		He retains enough of the old disbelief to give sanity to his judgment and gains enough love and insight to expound his subject with enthusiasm .

		His method consists in bringing out by liberal quo - tation the principles which
Rousseau	PERSON	developed in his works , and in showing from the events of his life of what diverse elements this curious genius was compounded .

		The lectures which form the sub - stance of the volume do not pretend to be a philo - sophical treatise , but they give a good idea of what
Rousseau	PERSON	thought and did .

		They are written in a free-and-easy style , and are rather familiar talks than formal addresses .

		The translation by Mme.
Charles Bigot	PERSON	-LRB-
Jeanne Mairot	PERSON	-RRB- has some un-English words and constructions , but is on the whole pleas - ing and is never obscure .

		Confessions of '' ` E ' ^ evy newspaper office , '' declares a reformed Mr.
William Salisbury	PERSON	in his '' Career journalist .

		of a Journalist '' -LRB-
B. W. Dodge & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , `` is a school of cynicism '' ; and his pages breathe , throughout , a spirit of cynical contempt for his for - mer calling and for himself for having engaged in it .

		Signed statements , he tells us , were the rage with Mr.
Hearst	PERSON	's newspapers , on one of which he was for a short time employed as reporter , and more than one such statement he freely acknowledges him - self to have fabricated , the ostensible author seeing it for the first time in print , with his own name under it .

		These statements , it is further explained , owed their inspiration to no higher source than a city directory , a near-by resort where certain liquids were sold , and a vivid and fertile imagination .

		For so young a person -- he speaks of himself as nineteen in
1895	DATE	-- this ex-journalist has had an astonishing experience of disillusionment , of sobering disen - chantment , and sad realization that behind the glit - ter and glamour of much that dazzles the eyes of youth there lies nothing more substantial than the shadow of a foolish dream .

		With a really enviable command of fluent and forcible English , he tells us in his concluding chapter : '' I have seen joy and sorrow hold the stage in high life and low life .

		I have seen many glorious pageants in the world 's greatest cities , and I have reported more funerals than I can remember .

		... I have watched victims of tragedies give their dying gasps , and h ^ ard the wails of newly made widows and orphans . ''

		And so on , at some length .

		A style subdued to what it so long has worked in contributes no little to the surface charm of Mr.
Salisbury	PERSON	's rattling tale -- or `` story , '' as it must , in a journalistic sense , be called .

		The sort of journalism in which he was engaged was certainly , according to his account , an ignoble pursuit ; and his book may serve a useful purpose as a warning and example -- while not necessarily discouraging to those having the qualifications and ambition for legitimate and honorable newspaper work .

		A racy account ' / With the Border Ruffians '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- of border-life is an interesting book , whether re - sixtv years ago .

		goxdieA as a mere story , as autobiog - raphy , or as a description of bygone social conditions .

		The author , Mr.
R. H. Williams	PERSON	, was a roving En - glishman , who came to the
United States	LOCATION	in
1852	DATE	in search of fortune and adventure .

		He spent two years in the mountains of whait is now the southern border of
West Virginia	LOCATION	, four years in
Kansas	LOCATION	ter - ritory during the border troubles , and eight years on the
Texas	LOCATION	frontier during and after the Civil War .

		In
1868	DATE	he returned to
England	LOCATION	, settled down to a quiet life , and eventually became a justice of the peace .

		He wrote out his American journal in
1902	DATE	, but its publication has been deferred until now .

		The style of the book is colloquial and with - out pretense of literary finish , but is lively enough to hold the attention of the most listless reader .

		Historical allusions are somewhat careless and in - accm ` ate , but the description of social conditions at the three points upon the margin of civilization , where the writer lived , is unsurpassed .

		The title is misleading in that it gives the impression that the book deals chiefly with the
Kansas	LOCATION	conflict .

		Only a small part relates to that subject , but this part is interesting as a reflection of pro-slavery prejudices and point of view .

		More than two-thirds of the whole deals with the
Texas	LOCATION	period , and gives vivid pictures of ranch life , Indian raids , and bushwhack - ing , during the Civil War .

		Especially important is the light the book throws upon the cruelty and corruption of the Confederate service upon the frontier .

		There is no apparent good reason why the author should have felt so strong a call to de - fend Southern rights , but like many young men at the outbreak of the war he mistook a love of excite - ment for patriotism .

July 16	DATE	, BRIEFER MENTION .

		A volume of '' Aphorisms and Reflections , '' selected from the writings of
T. H. Huxley	PERSON	by his widow , is pub - lished by
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Huxley was one of the meatiest of writers , and bears well this somewhat search - ing test of the quality of his thought .

		An elaborate index makes this little book a veritable boon to the literary worker in need of apt illustrative quotations .

		Huxley 's range was so wide that no seeker is likely to close the book quite empty-handed . ''

		The Appreciation of Music , '' by Messrs.
Thomas Whitney Surette	PERSON	and
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	, is pub - lished `` by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a series which already includes volimaes upon the appreciation of liter - ature and other forms of art .

		It presents '' in clear and untechnical language an account of the evolution of musical art from the primitive folk-song up to the symphony of Beethoven , '' illustrating the stages of this development by musical examples , and providing detailed analyses of many typical compositions .

		The volume has several portrait illustrations .


Messrs E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a series of small books collectively entitled '' The Wisdom of the East . ''

		The general editorship of these books -LRB- ten in number -RRB- is in the hands of Mr.
L. Cranmer	PERSON	- Byng and Dr.
S. A. Kapadia	PERSON	.

		The special editing is also in competent hands , for we note such names as those of Professor
L. D. Bamett	PERSON	, Mr.
Lionel Giles	PERSON	, and others .

		Three of the volumes are given to Confucius , one to the Chinese mystic
Chuang Tzu	PERSON	, two to the Persians , two to the Arabs , one to the
Vedanta	LOCATION	philosophy , and one to the teachings of
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	.

		They appear to be excellent little books , combining text and comimentary in a useful way , and well calculated to popularize the religious philo - sophies of the Asiatic world .

		The book-lover -LRB- in all senses of the term -RRB- will find his account in a volume upon
Horace	PERSON	, which comes to us in a limited edition from the Elm Tree Press ,
Woodstock	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, and is edited by Messrs.
Charles Loomis Dana	PERSON	and
John Cotton Dana	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is essentially a volume of illustrative examples of the Roman poet , given in English translations selected from the bewilder - ing variety of versions that are at hand for choice .

		The translations range all the way from
Cowley	PERSON	and
Dryden	PERSON	to Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	and Mr.
Roswell Field	PERSON	, and are classified according to subject .

		Besides these , the volume contains a group of interesting essays upon Horatian themes , such as the friends , the loves , the education , and the religion of the poet .

		Last of all , there are about thirty judiciously-chosen illustrations .

		The volume is delightful to view and to handle , and there can be no doubt concerning the warmth of the welcome it will get from all true Horatians .

		Notes .

		A new school edition of the first six books of the '' iEneid '' comes to us from
Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It IS the work of Messrs.
H. R. Fairclough	PERSON	and
Seldon L. Brown	PERSON	, and is equipped for student use with a very comprehensive modern apparatus .

		Two posthumous papers by ''
Ouida	PERSON	, '' dealing with matters of especial interest to women , are to be pub - lished , so saith report , in ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Magazine '' with the fall of the leaf .

		The Lippincott vaults have held the manuscripts for several years , agreement having been made that these late products of the romancer 's pen should see the light only after her death .

		It is expected that they will create something of a sensation . ''

		The Witchcraft Delusion in
Colonial Connecticut	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
John M. Taylor	PERSON	, is an interesting addition to the
Grafton Historical Series	ORGANIZATION	, published at the
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is prepared directly from the sources , and constitutes an authoritative addition to our colonial history .

		With its
July	DATE	number , '' The Forum '' reverts from the quarterly method of publication to its original plan of monthly issue .

		Fiction will hereafter be admitted , the opening chapters of Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	's new serial , '' The Point of Honor , '' being published in the
July	DATE	number .

		The Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	import for the American market a volume of selected poems by
Carducci	PERSON	, translated and appreciatively prefaced by Miss
Maud Holland	PERSON	.

		The Italian text faces the pages of translation , which gives the book an additional interest .

		We wish only that there were more of it .

		From the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	we have a study , by Mrs.
Juliana Haskell	PERSON	, of ''
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	's Transla - tion of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Faust . ''

		The writer is mainly concerned to inquire whether the translation may be considered an English poem , and her conclusion is a decided negative .

		In this we think she is right , however much we may admire the scholarship and the painstaking fidelity of
Taylor	ORGANIZATION	's version .

		Mr.
Stanley Paul	PERSON	, for the past six years manager of the publishing house of
Messrs. Hutchinson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, has recently embarked in business on his own accoimt , with offices in
Clifford	LOCATION	's Inn , Fleet Street .

		It is Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's intention to devote particular attention to the exploitation of American books m the British and Colonial markets , and he is desirous of making arrange - ments with American authors and publishers toward that end .

		Legal protection for correspondence against unauthor - ized publication has long been felt to be a desideratum .

		The recent Publishers '
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Madrid	LOCATION	expressed the wish that each country there represented should by formal legislation declare all letters to be literary pro- perty and protected by the laws relating to literary property in general , and therefore not legally publishable without the consent of both parties to the correspondence , their heirs or assigns .

		Professor
J. E. Spingarn	PERSON	has edited , and the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	has published , two volumes of '' Criti - cal Essays of the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Dryden alone does not appear , since his critical writings may be had in the admirable edition of Professor
Ker	PERSON	.

		On the other hand .

		Professor
Gregory Smith	PERSON	's '' Elizabethan Critical Essajs '' prepares the way for the present work .

		Twenty-five authors are represented , including
Bacon	PERSON	,
Jonson	PERSON	,
Chapman	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Davenant	PERSON	,

Bertram Dobell	PERSON	.

		He writes to the
London	LOCATION	`` Athenaeum '' asking all holders of the poet 's letters to lend them to him for use in the proposed biography .

		A very full life in two large volumes was published in
1878	DATE	, but Mr.
Dobell	PERSON	thinks there is need of a shorter and more critical account of this charming but too little read poet .

		BRIEFER MENTION 67 NOTES 68 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 69 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 70 THE ASCENT OF
PARNASSUS	LOCATION	.

		There are two ways of climbing , respectively illustrated by the great Pyramid and by the Campanile at
Venice	LOCATION	.

		The climber may toil painfully from one huge step to another pushed and pulled by perspiring guides urged to activity by thoughts of backsheesh ; or he may loiter along a gentle gradient and attain altitude with - out seeming effort .

		The end is the same in both cases when at last the wide prospect gladdens the eye ; but the ease or difficidty with which it has been achieved may have a notable influence upon the degree of its enjoyment .

		Turning to literature for a metaphorical application of our example , we are reminded of the contrast between the difficulties which once beset the upward path of the struggling student and the enticements which our humaner modern methods provide to make the way alluring .

		Humanity may be overdone , as a famous outburst of
Ibsen 's Brand	ORGANIZATION	attests ; but on the whole we may rejoice that a great deal of merely obstructive rubbish -- sjmtactical and rhetorical -- has been swept out of the learner 's path .

		Surely the old-time student , clambering toward latinity up his
Gradus	ORGANIZATION	ad Parnassum ^ must have thought the stairway ironically named , and must have reached his goal -LRB- if he persevered -RRB- in a some - what embittered frame of mind .

		If thus alone were Parnassus to be reached -LRB- he may weU have reflected -RRB- there was much to be said for a life of Boeotian sluggishness and comfort .

		In fact , he could hardly have failed to doubt if
Parnas	LOCATION	- sus were what it was cracked up to be .

		A doubt of this sort is pretty likely to intrude upon the mind of the aspirant toward the appre - ciation of literature , whether in school or out , if he follow the instructions of the professional educator .

		For literature is a fine art , and the natural man -LRB- still more the natural boy -RRB- does not take to it .

		He is willing to give it a try , because the sharps who ought to know say that there is something in it ; but his skepticism is well - rooted , and doubt may harden into conviction if injudiciously dealt with .

		Supply him with counsels of perfection , instead of giving him the practical guidance which he needs , and he will chuck the whole business in disgust .

		TeU him that he must read -LRB- and enjoy -RRB-
Bacon	LOCATION	's Essays 52 THE DIAL -LSB- Avxgust 1 , and '' The Rape of the Lock '' and '' Paradise Lost '' when he is in the '' Arabian Nights '' and '' Treasure Island '' stage of development , and all his healthy young instincts will revolt .

		He will not only reject the advice with seorn and contumely , but he will put the adviser down as a hypocrite ; for nothing will convince him that a person who pretends to enjoy such books really means what he says .

		This state of mind is perfectly honest , and must be treated with gingerly care if we expect to transform it into a state of mind which shall come to accept the world 's literary judgments as its own .

		A German publisher named
August Scherl	PERSON	, who has come to look at the subject of literary culture from this point of view , has recently prepared a library of fifty volumes , selected and arranged for the express purpose of attracting readers whose literary sense is comparatively crude , and of leading them onward and upward by easy steps .

		We have been much interested in the examination of
Herr Scherl	ORGANIZATION	's list , which begins with a story of mystery by
Xavier de Mont	PERSON	^ pin and ends with
Freytag	PERSON	's '' Soil und Haben . ''

		Possibly the forty-eight intervening books would be inadequate to bridge the cul - tural chasm delimited by these two landmarks ; but the principle involved is pedagogically sound , and by some such method as this the faculty for enjoying good literature is most likely to be developed .

		In the first half of the list we find such books as ''
Monte Cristo	PERSON	, ''
Jokai	PERSON	's '' Black Diamonds , '' tales of adventure by
Gerstacker	PERSON	, and novels by writers as diverse as
M. Georges Ohnet	PERSON	, Mrs.
Braddon	PERSON	, Mr.
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	, Mrs.
F. H. Burnett	PERSON	, Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, and
Bulwer	PERSON	.

		These are the names that come near - est to having relations with literature ; the others stand upon a distinctly lower level .

		When we get into the second haK of the list , we are conscious of being in distinctly better society .

		Sensational titles become less frequent , and names that mean something occur in num - bers .

		Thus we soon come upon Hugo 's `` Notre Dame de
Paris	LOCATION	, '' CoUins 's '' The Moonstone , '' and novels by Messrs.
Ernst von Wolzogen	PERSON	and
Georg von Ompteda	PERSON	.

		Finally , we reach such books as '' Ivanhoe , '' ''
Froment Jeune	PERSON	et
Risler Aine	PERSON	, '' and ''
Bleak House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and such authors as
Hauff	PERSON	,
Hoffman	PERSON	,
Herr Detlev von Liliencron	PERSON	,
Frau Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	,
Herr Fon	ORGANIZATION	- tane , and
Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	.

		It wiU be seen that this list of books is made up entirely of fiction , and that it is cosmopolitan in its composition .

		The sesthete and the pedant will sniff at four-fifths of the books included .

		and sermonize about the deplorable influence of such rubbish upon the growing mind .

		But to our thinking , the very fact that the sort of mind aimed at is growing , with maturity nowhere in sight , affords ample justification for the inclu - sion of the least significant and the most sensa - tional of the books above mentioned .

		A similar list prepared for a public of English readers should be based upon the same leading prin - ciples , although most of the titles would be dif - ferent .

		Such a list would doubtless include , and should include , titles by Messrs.
Hall Caine	PERSON	and
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	and
Marion Crawford	PERSON	, as well as titles by
Scott	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		The method is beautifully simple .

		First , allay the young reader 's suspicion that he is being practised upon , and gain his confidence by giv - ing him what he really wants .

		Then cautiously and persuasively contrive to get into his hands something a little better than he has had before .

		Some of our more progressive librarians have practised this method for many years .

		An excellent device , that has been found to work successfully , is to insert in every copy of a trashy book issued a slip giving the names and library numbers of a few other books likely to interest the reader , but books which are a little better in their representation of life and char - acter .


Herr Julius Hart	PERSON	, discussing the Scherl Li - brary in '' Das Literarische Echo , '' commends the enterprise in terms of unqualified praise . ''

		Is it in school that we learn to read ?

		No !

		All school methods are so contrived that they make books an object of hatred and a cause of misery .

		We learn to read from books of the <
Monte Cristo	ORGANIZATION	' sort : fairy - books and tales of adventure give us our first real joy in reading .

		For the imagination , that faculty for which the school has no room , and which pedagogy most atrociously maltreats , from its shackles and dungeons clamors for freedom .

		Our truly vital sense and knowl - edge of the superiority of a
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	over a Mont ^ pin is not born within us , not bestowed upon us by nature , but is attained by our own individual effort .

		When , acting after the fashion of the schoolmaster , I snatch a novel from the hand of the uncultivated reader and force him to read a masterpiece instead , I am plucking up by the roots his genuine feeling for art , I am destroying his natural enjoyment .

		I am depriving him of the very book that provides for him the high - est artistic revelation that is possible for him , I am robbing him of of the greatest of artistic blessings .

		He becomes a parrot , and learns only as a bare fact that
Goethe	PERSON	is the greatest of poets .

		Also our theoretical instruction in criticism is of secondary value only .

		And it is sheer stupidity to take a reader , plunged by some popular fiction into an ecstasy of delight , and prove to him from
Lessing	PERSON	and Aristotle that his satisfaction springs from the wrong sources . ''

		Perhaps this language is a trifle over-emphatic .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 but to destroy the walls of pedagogical pre - scription a trumpet blast rather than the piping of a penny whistle is needed .

		We should very much like to see the Scherl experiment tried in English .

		To outward seem - ing the product would be merely another library of reprints .

		But if the selection were skilfully made , by someone having a genuine psychologi - cal insight into the workings of the immature mind , the series would be unlike any that now exists .

		It would move steadily , although prob - ably in a spiral path , from comparatively crude examples of fiction to works of refined art .

		Each book in the series would be carefully chosen with special reference to the one that came before and the one that was to follow .

		And many a reader , working not painfully but delightedly through the series , would at the end of his upward progress find himself , not perhaps upon the very summit of
Parnassus	LOCATION	, but at least well above the level of its lower slopes .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The ingenious Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	can invent other things besides plots for novels .

		In an illustrated book - let , ''
William De Morgan	PERSON	, '' issued for free distribution by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, we read that this versa - tile son of the noted mathematician and logician ,
Augustus De Morgan	PERSON	-LRB- author of the well-known `` Budget of Paradoxes '' -RRB- not only manufactures tiles of so peculiar a lustre and finish that they are in demand for the best English houses , but he also claims to have devised the best duplex bicycle -LRB- whatever that may be -RRB- and the most effective sieve in existence , as well as a smoke - consuming fire-grate .

		Two snap-shot photographs of Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	taking his ease in sunny
Florence	LOCATION	reveal him as a very likable , thoroughly sincere sort of man , and a reproduction of a portrait of him painted by his artist wife gives another rather different but not unfavorable impression .

		When he is not in
Florence	LOCATION	he lives at
Chelsea	LOCATION	, in a rambling house called '' The Vale , '' to which Mrs.
De Morgan	PERSON	's studio is attached .

		In a recent magazine article the novelist thus described his way of working : '' I make no scenario , I just go on finding , as one often does , such inspiration as is neces - sary from my pen .

		I find that the mere holding of a pen makes me think .

		The pen even seems to have some consciousness of its own .

		It can certainly begin the work .

		Then I forget all about it and go on where - soever thought or the characters lead me .

		I think I work best in
Florence	LOCATION	, where il is always quiet and where there is something stimulating in the air .

		I work there all the winter through . ''

		Shakespeare as a '' reformed '' speller , though he lived three hundred years too early to be conscious of his reformation , is instructively referred to by Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	in a paper read at the second annual meeting of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	and printed for dis - tribution by the
Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whether we are language - menders or not , radicals or conservatives in our spelling .

		it is of interest to know that in matters of orthography extremes may meet and the most radical measures may prove to be the most conservative in a certain sense .

		Many of the simplified spellings are quite largely recognized to be returns to ancient forms .

		In the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	folio of
1623	DATE	, for example , as Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	points out , the ending - er -LRB- where we now more commonly write - re -RRB- is far from unusual .

		Meter appears twice in that volume ; metre not at all .

		Scepter is found thirty-six times ; sceptre not once .

		Center is never spelled with - re .

		Sepulcher occurs eleven times , sepulchre twice .

		Theater is preferred to theatre five times out of six .

		Honor is met with in both spellings , but twice as often with - or as with - our .

		The man for whom
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's spelling was '' good enough '' was imfortunate in his choice of a model , however praise - worthy for his spirit of conservatism .

		One minor point presents itself for comment in Mr.
Lounsbury	PERSON	's carefully - prepared paper .

		In the very act of urging that any changes made should be consistent -- or , as he says , in regard to vowel-sounds , '' a decision ought to be reacht as to the precise form by which these sounds are to be indicated universally '' -- he uses -LRB- or the reformed printer does it for him -RRB- in two successive sentences the iovmsfonetic and orthography .

		We also find alfabet , not alphabet , in his paper .

		If the Greek letter phi must abdicate in one or in several instances , why not in all ?

		• • • The size of ex-presidents ' royalties , when ex - presidents of this country have been the recipients of royalties on literary productions , has been large .

		The current queries as to how much Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	will probably receive from the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	for his African hunting-book might perhaps receive some sort of approximate answer from the instance of General Grant 's '' Personal Memoirs . ''

		A sum varying from four hundred thousand to half
a million dollars	MONEY	is com - monly given as Mrs.
Grant	PERSON	's receipts from this book .

		Before it was published , the author had received what were then considered very large payments for the serial issue of certain portions in `` The Century Magazine '' ; and the annual returns on the work even now must be considerable .

		The first check sent to Mrs.
Grant	PERSON	by the publishers is said -LRB- who knows on what authority ? -RRB-

		to have been for two hundred thousand dollars , and the next for three-quarters of that sum , -- figures that might fill with envy even the writers of latter-day '' best sellers . ''

		Mr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	, it is reported , received hand - some remuneration for what he wrote ; and no president before Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	has written so much and on so great a variety of subjects .

		The editing and publishing of the late ex-president 's unpublished writings will be a literary event of interest in the near future -- all but eclipsed , of course , by the hunting adventures of a living ex-president .

		, .

		, The revival of an old idea of
Franklin	PERSON	's is seen in the biU recently before Parliament for inducing the British public to make more use of daylight and less use of lamplight during the
summer	DATE	months .

		In the
spring of 1679	DATE	Franklin , then in
Paris	LOCATION	, wrote a playful article -LRB- entitled in his collected works '' An Economical Project '' -RRB- professing his surprise , on being accidentally awakened one morning at six , at beholding the sun rising and flooding his room with light .

		The astonishing dis - covery that
Paris	LOCATION	was illuminated by the sun long before people of fashion thought of rising , he hastened to com - municate to the public , and then added his calculations on the amount of wax and tallow burned every
summer	DATE	54 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, for lighting purposes by the citizens of the French capital .

		Between the
20th of March	DATE	and the
20th of September	DATE	, according to his estimate , there were sixty-four million pounds of these illuminants needlessly consumed , at a cost of
ninety-six million francs	MONEY	.

		He proposed a plan of ringing morning bells , firing cannon , and so forth , to compel all sleepers to open their eyes to the light of day and recognize the propriety of using it .

		The present English project is less obstreperous : it advocates the quiet putting forward of clocks twenty minutes each
Sunday	DATE	in
April	DATE	, with a reverse proceeding each
Sunday	DATE	in
September	DATE	, thus gradually making the
summer	DATE	work - ing day begin one hour and twenty minutes earlier than at present , and applying a practical test to the truth of an old adage hateful to sluggards .

		In no account of or reference to this curious patriarchal -LRB- not to say mediae - val -RRB- bit of proposed legislation have we seen any acknowl - edgment to
Franklin	PERSON	as the original inventor of the scheme .

		But he was never so popular in
London	LOCATION	as in
Paris	LOCATION	, and perhaps the oversight is not wholly accidental .

		The library of the `` Laughing Hall , '' as de - scribed by Mr.
J. N. Farquhar	PERSON	in that excellent Indian monthly , '' The Hindustan Review '' -LRB- edited by
Sach	ORGANIZATION	- chidananda
Sinha	PERSON	and published at
Allahabad	LOCATION	-RRB- is a separate building connected with most of the larger Buddhist temples in
Japan	LOCATION	-- perhaps elsewhere too , though this is not made clear -- and is usually prettily carved and brightly painted , and seldom open to visitors .

		But admission is not difficult to obtain , and when the doors are flung apart the first object to meet the view is the wooden statue of
Fu Daishi	ORGANIZATION	, or `` the Great Buddhist Teacher , '' with his two sons beside him , one at the right , the other at the left , and both laughing heartily ; hence the name of the hall .

		But the chief feature of the library of the Laughing Hall -LRB- '' Warai-do '' -RRB- is a mammoth octagonal revolving bookcase which nearly fills the building , but is so nicely mounted on its pivot as to turn under a gentle pressure of the hand .

		The case is supposed to contain a printed copy of the Chinese Buddhist canon , but this is seldom found to be complete .

		Fu
Daishi	ORGANIZATION	, a wise Chinese teacher , realizing that the canon was too big to be studied and understood in its entirety , invented the revolving bookcase -- a sort of sacred carrousel one might call it -- and caused it to be proclaimed that whoever made the novel construction spin round thrice on its axis would thereby acquire the same merit as if he had mastered the whole body of religious literature it held .

		The two boys , one may imagine , are laughing in filial glee at their father 's cleverness .

		But , after all , this is only another form of the familiar praying-wheel , so that we see not why the lads should split their sides over it .

		• • • Ways of denoting emphasis in print are more numerous and varied than one might at first suppose .

		Punctuation is one recognized method : separating a word or phrase by commas from the rest of the sen - tence often gives it a mild but immistakable emphasis of its own .

		The little arcs of circles that are used for parentheses may also call special attention to what they profess to make merely subordinate to the context .

		The exclamation point , too , either alone or in connection with the marks of parenthesis , is an effective emphasizer .

		Dashes , in pairs or singly , are often impressive to the eye .

		Italics , of course , afford the readiest and common - est means of arresting attention ; but many printing offices dislike these warped and unsightly characters , and the compositor 's unwillingness to be troubled with an addi - tional and little-used font of type is only natural .

		Readers of German must have noted with approval the common mode of marking emphasis in that language , -- the spac - ing of the letters of the emphasized word .

		To reader and compositor alike this device commends itself and might well be adopted universally .

		Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, let it be counted to his credit , is doing his best to naturalize this typographical Teutonism in his own country .

		The innovation has much in its favor .

		The spaced letters represent to the eye what the slower , more impressive pronunciation of the stressed word is to the ear .

		Of course the manuscript indication of emphasis by underlining would remain unchanged , but for type - writers spacing would be a welcome substitute for the present usage .

		... The puzzling pronunciation of proper names is a constant source of fret and vexation ; and this waste of nervous energy is a thing to be avoided when the mer - cury stands at ninety and over in the shade .

		The pun - gent pen of the public librarian at
Los Angeles	LOCATION	has been making merry , in a semi-satirical manner , over the twelve native mispronunciations of the name of his city .

		Especially does he deprecate the '' jabber ^ '' almost uni - versally heard in the utterance of the name , whereas the true sound is not unlike that of German ch , or , if one can not achieve the aspirated guttural , our own hard g will serve fairly well in rapid pronunciation . ''

		Quite as bad , '' continues Mr.
Lummis	PERSON	, '' are those who give the two e 's the ' day ' soimd -LRB- which e in Spanish has only when accented -RRB- and call the last word ' ANN-Hay-Lace . '

		This is indeed a commonplace of the two-bit * Spanish - in-twenty-four-lessons ' vocabularies ; but is as offensive to the critic as the jabber g. Despite notable geographic differences , the e-soimds are identical m ' heaven ' ' hell ' and '
Los Angeles	LOCATION	. ' ''

		To sum up the whole case in convenient mnemonic form , Mr.
Lunamis	PERSON	appends '' the following local jingle '' : `` The lady would remind you , please , Her name is not
Lost Angle Lees	LOCATION	, Nor
Angie	PERSON	anything whatever .

		She hopes her friends will be so clever To share her fit historic pride The O shall not be jellified .

		O longr , G hard , and rhyme with ' yes , ' And all about Loce Ang-el-ess . ''

		A COPPEE ANECDOTE , at ouce enjoyable and pointing a wholesome moral , has been wafted across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The deceased novelist and poet was in early life intro - duced to Catulle Mend ^ s , who received him cordially and welcomed him to his salon in the
Rue de Douai	LOCATION	, where a little circle of poets recited their poems to one another .

		One day Mendfes received an unsigned copy of verses written in a beautiful hand ; and the same even - ing he read them -- they bore the title '' Les Fleurs Mortelles '' -- to his assembled company .

		They evoked praise to the point of enthusiasm ; and when their author -LRB-
Copp	PERSON	^ e , of course -RRB- acknowledged them as his , and con - fessed to '' six thousand others , '' his kind host bade him bring them also , bring them all !

		The young man com - plied , and , after Mendfes had finished reading them , asked his opinion of their merit . ''

		To be frank with you , '' was the critic 's blunt rejoinder , `` they are all execrable .

		You are admirably gifted , but you do n't know the first word of your trade . '' ''

		Teach it to me , then , '' returned
Copp	PERSON	^ e , and without flinching he threw his precious verses , the whole six thousand , into the fire and resolutely set about learning how to do better .

		Amor de

Federico Uhrbach	PERSON	, and La Vision del Aguila , by

		There seems to be , indeed , a remarkable intellectual ferment throughout all
Latin America	LOCATION	.

Cuba	LOCATION	alone , such names as Ricardo del Monte ,
Conde Kostia	LOCATION	,
Enrique Jos ^ Varona	PERSON	,
Alfredo Martin Morales	PERSON	, and
Arturo R. de Carricarte	PERSON	, though little known to us , count for a good deal .

		All these writers , all the Spanish - American writers , look to
France	LOCATION	for leadership and models , and it would probably be impossible to shake this allegiance and get them to accept our ideals and art .

		But now that the
United States	LOCATION	is making an effort to know and be known to the other peoples of our Western World , it would not only be a courteous but a politic thing to give some attention to .

		their literature .

		There is noth - ing that any country appreciates more than consideration paid to its intellectual performances .

		Why does not one of our enterprising magazines secure from a com - petent authority an article or set of articles giving some account of Cuban and Mexican and South American writers ?

		... The humors of genealogy-hunters , as they dis - play themselves to weary and long-suffering library attendants , reveal very clearly the fact that however varied and unaccountable may be the humors of these delvers into forgotten lore , their sense of humor , in the singular number , is conspicuously absent .

		From the
Peabody Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Baltimore	LOCATION	- comes the story of a pedigree-chaser who , with the customary vagueness of conception as to what line of inquiry to pursue and what books to ask for , placidly shifted the burden of the whole affair on to the shoulders of the uncomplaining attendant .

		In due time a smaU mountain of books likely to prove helpful was brought to the visitor , who , after surveying them in surprise , pleaded weakness of eyesight and asked the panting servitor to do the neces - sary reading and dig for the desired information .

		But this was more than that accommodating person could undertake , regular duties forbidding .

		`` Well , '' said the other , with a last look at the laboriously gathered volumes , '' I '11 read thpm some other time .

		Good day , and thank you ever so much ! ''

		It may be interesting to note that the visitor was a woman .

		A
Quebec	LOCATION	pageant in a library is what the fine display of Americana at the
John Carter Brown Library	ORGANIZATION	might be called .

		While the conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	has just been presented in mimic form to the citizens of
Quebec	LOCATION	and their visiting friends , the people of Provi - dence and vicinity have had exposed to their view a rich collection of priceless manuscripts , maps , and early printed works , relating to the early history of our northern neighbor .

		Most important of all is the auto - graph manuscript of
Champlain	LOCATION	's account of his first voyage to this continent and of his explorations as far southward as the
West Indies	LOCATION	and the
City of Mexico	LOCATION	.

		This manuscript , after remaining in the hands of
Champlain	LOCATION	's descendants for three hundred years , was purchased by
John Nicholas Brown	PERSON	in
1884	DATE	, and event - ually became a part of the memorial library named after his father ,
John Carter Brown	PERSON	, and now administered by the trustees of
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	.

		This library , because of its imrivalled collection of early Americana , is able to make a unique display of illustrative matter beaxing on the great events celebrated at

America	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, and of the desirability of a firm friendship between the two .

		He takes occasion to say that ''
Japan	LOCATION	has never been , and is not now ,
Oriental	ORGANIZATION	, as are
India	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	, and
Korea	LOCATION	.

		Its two hundred and fifty years of exclusiveness and of isolated feudal development , as well as certain racial characteristics , prevented the more purely Oriental type of civilization from gaining supremacy there . ''

		And , what is more , he believes that '' the citizen of the
United States	LOCATION	or of
Western Europe	LOCATION	, who is prepared to get below certain superficial differences and reach down to the more fundamental likeness , may feel more at home m
Japan	LOCATION	than in certain parts of

		* Like
Magna Charta	ORGANIZATION	and the Bill of Rights and the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	, the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' has always been taken seriously ; and so long as it resists the increasingly demoralizing tenden - cies of the press , it will maintain its claim on our serious consideration .

		Some late controversies and other events , widely chronicled and dis - cussed , have brought '' The Times '' into unusual public notice , so that the appearance just now of a life of its greatest editor ,
John Thadeus Delane	PERSON	, is peculiarly seasonable ; for an account of Delane during his thirty-six years ' editorial conduct of '' The Times '' is an account of the paper itself during that period .

		It was in those years , from
1841	DATE	to
1877	DATE	, that this newspaper , already a prominent and authoritative journal under
Thomas Barnes	PERSON	's editorship , attained a position of unexampled influence and dignity , and made even princes and potentates tremble when it chose to frown .

		How closely
John Delane	PERSON	identified himself with '' The Times '' is indicated by the fact that he became its editor at twenty-three years of age and continued in the editorial chair until two years before his death at sixty-two , taking few and short vacations , cherishing no absorbing out - side interests , and never even allowing himself the sweet distraction of a wife .

		Though he wrote comparatively little himself , there passed under his editorial eye and corrective pen prob - ably no fewer than forty thousand articles which were printed as editorial utterances and for which he was virtually and legally responsible .

		Much that appeared under the head of leading articles , says his biographer , '' was so amended by his pen that it was in reality
Delane	PERSON	s handiwork , and his ablest writers , instead of feeling impatient at his alterations and corrections , were free to confess that he had much improved their com - position . ''

		So early in his young manhood did this great editor take up the work to which he was to • devote the rest of his life that little of interest remains to be said of his history apart from his journalistic labors and those activities in society and in occasional travel that he made contrib - utory to his influence and equipment as head of '' The Times .

		Why
John Thadeus	PERSON	, or his parents , chose to misspell his middle name , is not explained .

		Graduated from
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, in
1840	DATE	, he immediately joined the staff of '' The Times , '' of which his father was busi - ness manager and
John Walter	PERSON	chief proprietor .

		Young
Delane	PERSON	had already dipped his maiden pen in journalistic ink , though what and how much he had written can not now be determined ; but his ability received prompt recognition of so cordial a nature that when
Barnes	PERSON	died in the following year the new recruit was called upon to fiU his chair .

		A few years later
Delane	PERSON	's college friend and subsequent brother-in-law ,
George Webbe Dasent	PERSON	, now known to the world chiefly for his studies in Norse mythology , was summoned to assist him in the editorship , and for a quarter of a century the two labored in a common cause with mutual profit and satisfac - tion .

		This professional and personal intimacy left
Dasent	PERSON	, ^ on his friend 's death , peculiarly fitted to become his biographer ; and a biog - raphy was contemplated , though contemplation had not passed into action when the surviving friend was himself overtaken by death , leaving to his son , Mr.
Arthur Irwin Dasent	PERSON	-LRB- who , by the way , also took a wife from the
Delane	PERSON	family -RRB- , the task not merely of completing , but of begin - ning as well as ending , the tardy history of
Delane	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant achievements in journalism .

		Letters in abundance , to and from
Delane	PERSON	, and especially from him to his friend Dasent , were at hand for aid in this work , and they have been copiously drawn upon in the book .

		To give , in the author 's own words , a con - ception of the power exerted by '' The Times '' under
Delane	PERSON	's editorship , we will quote a few sentences . ''

		As compared with the present state of the Press , now so largely dominated by sensation and advertise - ment , the influence of
The Times	ORGANIZATION	under
Delane	PERSON	can hardly be conceived ; and we may say without exagger - ation or partiality that , as conducted by him for a period of thirty-six years , the hterary reputation of the paper reached its zenith .

		Instead of blindly following public opinion , he rose to such a position of supremacy in his profession that he was able to create it ; and on more than one memorable occasion , if the Government of the day in formulating its policy minted the coin , it was The Times which uttered it and saw that it rang true . ''

		A three-page list of the journal 's principal contributors and staff-members under
Delane	PERSON	is appended , and the names of parliamentary leaders and other statesmen and celebrities who corresponded and considted with the great editor and potent moulder of public opinion would

Delane	LOCATION	's service the author says : ``

		There is still another famous character that must not be passed over in this connection .

		He has a paragraph to himself in the account of those who helped to build up '' The Times . '' ''

		But to the catalogue of clever brains who , at the bidding of a master mind , devoted the best years of their lives to building up the prosperity and power of The Times must be added the name of yet another , prominent alike in the world of politics and letters , with whom , from the very earliest days of his editor - ship ,
Delane	PERSON	was in close touch .

		This was
Charles Greville	PERSON	, that thorough man of the world , who , under a cynical exterior , successfully concealed a nature which contained the elements of kindliness and generosity .

		What
Pepys	PERSON	was to the seventeenth and
Horace Walpole	PERSON	to the eighteenth century , the sardonic '
Grun	PERSON	- cher ' was to the nineteenth , and his Memoirs , the very salt of political and social autobiography , must ever remain a mine of information to those who desire to study at first hand the inner history of governments in
England	LOCATION	from the reign of
George IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		to the mid - Victorian era . ''

		Delane 's occasional foreign travels took him as far east as the
Crimea	LOCATION	, in
1854	DATE	, and as far west as
Niagara Falls	ORGANIZATION	, in
1856	DATE	; and from his American letters to Dasent the following , writ - ten at
Albany	LOCATION	, comes near to being an epis - tolary curiosity . ''

		I really ought not to write you anything , for I am very tired , and unless I were to write a volume I could give you no real idea of the impression this country makes on me .

		It seems a mass of contradictions .

		Every - thing is so famUiar in one respect , and yet so unlike what one has ever seen before .

		People are extremely brusque and yet extravagantly civil .

		The servants are most obliging friends , strangers accost you after the old -LSB- a word illegible -RSB- form , and , having broken the ice , them - selves ' guess ' you would Uke to know their friends , who are accordingly introduced , shake hands and talk
Elec	ORGANIZATION	- tion .

		Then , leaving
Boston	LOCATION
this morning	TIME	, we have passed through fifty miles at least of primaeval forest with very few ' clearings , ' and even in these the stumps sticking up in every square yard , while whole groves of ' girdled ' trees in the distance look like as many skeletons .

		On
Saturday	DATE	a banker ' concluded * I was from
Europe	LOCATION	and talked an hour about what I had best see while a crowd of customers were waiting .

		The hotels are capital ; beyond all praise for their cleanliness , order , good attendance and hberality ... The English are very popular and I have heard it said a dozen times that
America	LOCATION	felt humbled when we declined to take offence at the dismissal of
Crampton	PERSON	.

		At church yesterday the preacher --
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, a great gun here -- spoke of
England	LOCATION	as ' that country which we all love so dearly , ' and on
Friday	DATE	all
Boston	LOCATION	went mad at a dinner given to
Peabody	LOCATION	as a reward for his supposed exertions to keep the peace . ''

		After all that , it is with regret that we recall the attitude taken by '' The Times '' toward this hospitable and liberal Northern section of our country when it found itself plunged in civil strife and acutely sensitive to the friendly or hostile air worn by on-looking nations across the water .

		With
Palmerston	LOCATION	in the government and
Delane	PERSON	in his great newspaper expressing sympathy for the South , how different might have been the course of nineteenth-century his - tory but for a combination of lucky accidents -- one of them being the break-down of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	cable , which at a critical juncture caused delay in trans-oceanic communication and made for calmer counsels and cooler second thoughts .

		In summing up
Delane	PERSON	's qualities in the con - cluding chapter of the book , the author has this to say among other things -- he refers especially to the famous editor 's sturdy independence : '' Taking this view of his position , he was at no time what could be called a party man , yet his instincts were essentially Liberal , as the columns of the paper suf - ficiently show .

		Hewn out of the very ore of liberty and progress , they will ever remain the best monument to his memory .

		It was his pride to administer the editorship justly , fearlessly , and generously , and while some may say that he was proud , harsh , and even a remorseless taskmaster , our testimony must be that he was a true , sincere , and kind-hearted man , animated by a lofty sense of duty , incapable of an unjust or dishonor - able act . ''

		This excellent biography of Delane the editor , but somewhat meagre description of Delane the man and member of society , is written in a style that comes so near to being good as almost to tantalize the reader .

		A very little more care would have polished many a roughness , smoothed out many a wrinkle .

		We must bestow a word of praise upon the excellent index and occasional footnotes , and the two clear portraits of Delane .

		There are but four other illustrations , which may be counted a relief in these days of cheap and abundant process prints .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The late WUlardFiske , besides leaving to
Cornell Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity his collection of Icelandic books , left also a fund of five thousand dollars , the income of which was to be de - voted to publications of Icelandic interest .

		The result is an annual called '' Islandica , '' the first volume of which , now issued , is a '' Bibliography of the Icelandic Sagas and Minor Tales , '' prepared by Mr.
Halldor Hermannsson	PERSON	.

		58 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, The Unrest of the Orient .

		* That the political and economic equilibrium of the Orient has rarely been less stable than it is to-day , is the all but universal testimony of observers of
Far Eastern	ORGANIZATION	affairs .

		We are assured on every hand that the restless ambition and aggressiveness of
Japan	LOCATION	presages expansion , exploitation , bitter rivalries , and stubborn con - flict ; that
Russia	LOCATION	is but temporarily checked , not in any real sense defeated , in her great purpose of dominance toward the
Pacific	LOCATION	; that
China	LOCATION	is certain to remain a disturbing factor of prime importance , whether as an awakened and regenerated power or as the tool and victim of predatory nations ; that , in brief , the future historian of the Orient will look back upon the late Russo-Japanese war as merely an episode -- at the most , a sort of prologue -- in the peren - nial combat of Far Eastern forces .

		The most recent presentation of this line of argument by one who may fairly be termed an expert is to be found in Mr.
B. L. Putnam Weale	PERSON	's '' The Coming Struggle in
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		This volume is announced as the con - elusion of a series whose publication was begun five years ago .

		In '' Manchu and Muscovite '' -LRB-
1903	DATE	-RRB- the point of view was distinctly unfavor - able to
Russia	LOCATION	, and the author did not hesitate to shower praise upon the Japanese as the ablest rivals of the Muscovite and as the sole vigorous champions of the higher civilization in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		At the close of the war -LRB- during which Mr.
Weale	PERSON	was a careful personal observer of Far Eastern affairs -RRB- appeared a more ambitious work under the title '' The Re-shaping of the Far East . ''

		In this book the status of
China	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
Korea	LOCATION	, and
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and of the
Occi	PERSON	- dental powers represented in the Orient , was described at great length ; but the author felt obliged to recall much of his earlier laudation of
Japan	LOCATION	and to substitute for it an attitude of moderate censure , particularly when Korean affairs were under consideration .

		In
1907	DATE	the third book in the series was published , '' The Truce in the
East	LOCATION	and its Aftermath . ''

		In it the author advanced to a more pronounced arraign - ment of
Japan	LOCATION	, maintaining that Japanese aims and ideals had developed in a direction absolutely different from that which had been expected , and that they had become plainly sub - versive of the best interests of the Orient and of the world at large .

		The volume now under review , '' The Coming • The Coming Struggle in
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	.

		By
B. L. Putnam Weale	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Struggle in
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	, '' is hardly the ablest and most convincing of the series , but it con - tains much that is worth while , and in relation to Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's personal views it marks a full and unreserved conversion from the pro- Japanese of five years ago to the strongly anti- Japanese of to-day .

		The book is presented by its author as '' a careful revaluation of the old forces in the Far Eastern situation , as they dis - played themselves during the first half of this year -LRB-
1907	DATE	-RRB- . ''

		It falls into three parts , the first dealing with ''
Russia	LOCATION	Beyond
Lake Bai	PERSON	- kal , '' the second with '' The New Problem of
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	, '' and the third with '' The Struggle Round
China	LOCATION	. ''

		The first part comprises a very detailed description of conditions in easternmost
Russia	LOCATION	as the author found them during an observation trip in the
autumn of 1906	DATE	.

		The starting-point is
Vladivostock	LOCATION	, which , it is pointed out , has become once more '' the outlook post , the ad - vanced entrenched position of great
White Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		After an interesting exposition of the commercial and military strength of this point , the author goes on to tell of the
Ussuri	LOCATION	railway ,
Khabarovsk	LOCATION	and the Amur province , and the present status of
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		The fundamental fact , in Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's judgment , in the whole problem of the future of
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	is the steady , irrisistible , inevitable advance of
Russia	LOCATION	-- of
European Russia	LOCATION	-- toward the
Pacific	LOCATION	. ''

		The
Siberia	LOCATION	of the story-books , '' he declares , '' has already disappeared never to return .

		Siberia must now be looked upon as the exact Russian equivalent of the American Far West or the new
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Railways , a great movement of virile men and women , agricultural machinery , houses of brick , wood , and stone , and all the inventions of a mar - vellously inventive age , -- in a very short inter - val these can make an unconquered country , which is inhabited by inferior races and is gifted with a wholesome soil and climate , a new piece of
Europe	LOCATION	, as European as the countries of the old world , as white as the whitest . ''

		It is Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's conviction that they not only can do this , but that they are already rapidly doing it in
Asiatic Russia	LOCATION	.

		The second part of the book is taken up with a consideration of the present state of
Japan	LOCATION	, with reference to government , industry , com - merce , finance , military and naval strength , colonies , emigration , and international relations .

		Despite the strong anti-Japanese slant already mentioned , the treatment is candid and illumin - ating .

		Not the least valuable chapter for the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 59 general reader is one describing very clearly the actual workings of the Japanese imperial gov - ernment , accompanied by the complete text of the much misunderstood Japanese constitution of
1889	DATE	.

		This is followed , in the third part , by a similar interpretation of present-day
China	LOCATION	.

		Although one may not glean from it a great deal that is reaUy new , one can not put his hands upon a more sane , compact , and readable dis - cussion of the subject in English .


Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	.

		The
Larger Problems of Heredity	ORGANIZATION	.

		* We learn from the Preface to this book that it '' is intended as an introduction to the study of heredity , which everyone admits to be a subject of fascinating interest and of great practical importance ... Simple the exposition can not be , if one has any ambition for thoroughness ; but it is probably simple enough for those who have got beyond the pottering , platitudinarian stage , which deals in heredity with a capital H. '' This quotation may be supplemented by the remark that the book has the usual qualities of Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's writings ; that is to say , it is intelligible , pleasant to read , and distinguished by a broad outlook .

		If it does not contribute any important original facts , it is at least suf - ficiently original in the matter of treatment , while at the same time impartial enough to furnish an adequate exposition of all the more noteworthy points of view .

		At the present time , when there is a growing sense of the immense practical impor - tance of the subject , following close on the heels of numerous remarkable discoveries , the value of a work which is at once up to date and capable of being understood by any ordinarily intelligent person can scarcely be exaggerated .

		It is not too much to say , that no one is fitted to deal with the problems which are now looming large on the horizon of human affairs , who has not paid atten - tion to such matters as are discussed in Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's book .

		We are not exactly prepared to insist that the perusal of the work shoidd be a sine qua non for all who propose to exercise the rights of suffrage or of parenthood ; but it can scarcely be doubted that if it were possible to enforce such a ruling , great benefits would result .

		Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	is not one of those who would reduce sociology to a mere branch of zoology .

		Himself a keen sociologist , he recog - • Heredity .

		By
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		nizes fully that human society contains many elements which can not be interpreted -- at any rate at present -- by purely biological reasoning .

		To treat human consciousness and its conse - quences in a purely biological way is as mis - leading as the reduction of biological phenomena to mere chemistry and mechanics .

		Whatever one may believe as to ultimate possibilities , whatever monism may be one 's philosophical creed , humanity spells words which , whether or not composed of mere letters of the biological alphabet , mean something very different from those letters themselves , singly or collectively .

		All of this is fully and frankly recognized ; and because of this , the reader will accept with a better heart the weighty advice of biology to sociology -- advice no more to be brushed aside than that of the physical sciences to biology itseK . ''

		By the education of conscience on a scientific basis there is already arising a wholesome prejudice against the marriage and especially the intermarriage of sub - jects in whom there is a strong hereditary bias to certain diseases -- such as epilepsy and diabetes , to take two very different instances .

		Is it Utopian to hope that this will extend with increasing knowledge , and that the ethical consciousness of the average man will come more and more to include in its varied content ' a feeling of responsibility for the healthf ulness of succeeding genera - tions ? '

		... '' The argument always used against deliberate pre - ferential mating on a eugenic basis is that our ignorance is immense .

		And this must be frankly admitted .

		Yet there are some things that we do know ... '' That the best general constitutions should be mated , is the first rule of good breeding .

		That a markedly good constitution should not be paired with a markedly bad one , is a second rule , -- a disregard of which means wanton wastage .

		A third rule is that a person exhibit - ing a bias towards a specific disease should not marry another with the same bias .

		... In other words , every possible care should be taken of a relatively sound stock .

		The careless tainting of a good stock is a social crime '' -LRB- pp. 305-306 -RRB- .

		All this will have to contend with a wall of ancient prejudice ; nevertheless , -- '' The basis of preferential mating is not unalterable ; in fact , we know that it sways hither and thither from age to age .

		Possible marriages are everyday prohibited or refrained from for the absurdest of reasons ; there is no reason why they should not be prohibited or refrained from for the best of reasons -- the welfare of our race .

		For the average man , instinctive ' falling in love ' will probably remain a safer guide than any scientific eugenic counsels , but there is no reason to doubt that eugenic considerations will in the course of time enter sub - consciously into the prolegomena of that mysterious process . ''

		On the other hand , the process of selection can not be left to unaided '' nature . '' ''

		It has often been said that modern hygiene , in tend - ing to eliminate our eliminators -- the microbes -- is 60 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, destroying a most valuable selective agency which has helped to make our race what it is .

		This seems a little like saying that the destruction of venomous snakes in
India	LOCATION	is eliminating a most valuable selective agency which has helped to evolve the Wisdom of the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		It is difficult to find justification for the enthusiastic confidence which some seem to have in the value of microbes as eliminators .

		Which microbe ?

		Surely not that of plague , which strikes indifferently , and is no more discriminately selective than an earthquake .

		Surely not that of typhus , which used to kill weak and strong alike .

		Surely not that of typhoid , which may strike anyone , and does not confer more than a passing immunity .

		And so on through a long list . ''

		In other words , these microbes merely spare those resistant to themselves , a form of selection which produces results quite disconnected with higher human values , and only of importance from any standpoint in the presence of the dis - eases .

		In the competition of race with race , where some have undergone this kind of evolu - tion while others have not , the outcome has a terrible significance -- the tax which in the one case has been exacted through the centuries , being in the other levied all at once , as it were ; but for intraracial ends , especially in the light of modern science , the microbes may well be dispensed with .

		So says Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		At present we can only indicate that the future of our race depends on Eugenics -LRB- in some form or other -RRB- , combined with the simultaneous evolution of Eutechnics and Eutopias . '

		Brave words , ' of course ; but surely not ` Utopian ' ! ''

		-LRB- p. 308 -RRB- .

		It must not be supposed that the book con - sists principally of propagandist argument ; it is full of recitals of the most interesting and im - portant facts , which we make no attempt to summarize .

		It is for these that it should be read , because they supply the materials from which everyone may draw his own conclusions .

		In the attempt to be perfectly clear , the author has practically repeated himself a good deal in different places ; but this no doubt has an ade - quate pedagogical justification , assuming that the reader is not a specialist .

		Although the work may fairly be described as up to date , the progress of the subject is such that in the mere processes of printing and publishing any treat - ment gets belated .

		Thus it happens that the recent important results of Tower and Mac -
Dougal	PERSON	throwing light on the causes of variation have either not been considered or have reached the author so recently that it was impracticable to make use of them .

		That Tower 's work was not unknown to Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	is evident from the fact that he cites it in the bibliography and copies some of the figures from it .


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		Recent Poetry .

		* When Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	told the tragic story of the Lombard queen , some years ago , it seemed as if he had carried to its utmost extreme the reaction from the exuberant and verbose manner of his earlier dramatic period .

		But '' The Duke of Gandia '' shows that a further extreme was still possible , for nothing is more marvellous about this new work than its compression , its bareness of ornament , and its success in making suggestion a substitute for speech .

		For these reasons it does not lend itself readily to quotation .

		One fine passage of consider - able length may , however , be given , with the ex - planation that it is spoken by
Caesar Borgia	PERSON	, after he has done to death his brother
Francesco	PERSON	, to the grief-stricken
Alexander	PERSON	, their father . ''

		What they say and what thou sayest I hold False .

		Tho ' thou has wept as woman , howled as wolf , Above our dead , thou art hale and whole .

		And now Behoves thee rise again as Christ our God , Vicarious Christ , and cast as flesh away This grief from off thy godhead .

		I and thou , One , will set hard as never God hath set To the empire and the steerage of the world .

		Do thou forget but him who is dead , and was Nought , and bethink thee what a world to wield The eternal God hath given into thine hands Which daily mould him out of bread , and give His kneaded flesh to feed on .

		Thou and I Will make this rent and ruinous
Italy	LOCATION	One .

		Ours it shall be , body and soul , and great Above all power and glory given of God To them that died to set thee where thou art -- Throned on the dust of
Caesar	PERSON	and of
Christ	LOCATION	, Imperial .

		Earth shall quail again , and rise Again the higher because she trembled .

		Rome So bade it be : it was , and shall be . ''

		What is probably the most striking evidence of the re - straint under which the poet has placed himself in the composition of this grim tragedy is the fact that only a single lyric -- and that of four lines only -- occurs in the entire work .

		These are the lovely words of the song , the last upon the lips of the doomed
Francesco	PERSON	. ''

		Love and night are life and light ; Sleep and wine and song Speed and slay the halting day Ere it live too long . ''

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 `` That shalt not thou , '' says the assassin , and the dagger is plunged into
Francesco	PERSON	's breast .

		One old trick of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's diction has become a man - nerism in the present poem .

		We refer to the enjambement which carries a thought over to the first syllable of the next line .

		Four examples of this may be found in the passage above quoted , and innumerable others elsewhere in the work .

		Artist - ically , the effect of this device is admirable ; it heightens our sense of the verbal economy at which the poet has so evidently aimed throughout .

		This marvellous work , which no other poet now living could dream of equalling , is of small dimensions , consisting of but four hundred verses , divided into four brief scenes .

		But it bears all the burden of a full-grown tragedy .

		These remarks about Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's tragedy may fittingly be followed by an account of the vol - ume in which Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	pays reverent homage to his master .

		It is another case of '' The youngest to the oldest singer That
England	LOCATION	bore , '' for Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	is the latest comer to the ranks of those to whom poetry is a high and sacred mission , and his tribute was evoked by the occasion of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's seventieth birthday .

		We have space only for the last two of the four stanzas . ''

		For he , the last of that immortal race Whose music like a robe of living light Re-clothed each new-born age and made it bright As with the glory of Love 's transfiguring face , Reddened earth 's roses , kindled the deep blue Of
England	LOCATION	's radiant ever-singing sea , Recalled the white Thalassian from the foam , Woke the dim stars anew .

		And triumphed in the triumph of Liberty , We claim him ; but he hath not here his home . ''

		Not here !

		Round him to-day the clouds divide .

		We know what faces thro ' that rose-flushed air Now bend above him --
Shelley	PERSON	's face is there , And Hugo 's lit with more than kingly pride ; Replenished there with splendour the blind eyes Of Milton bend from heaven to meet his own ;
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	is there crowned with those queenlier flowers Whose g ^ aft outgrew our skies , His gift : Shakespeare leans earthward from his throne With hands outstretched .

		He needs no crown of ours . ''

		We particularly welcome in Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	the recur - rence of that note of deep and lofty patriotism which is the glory , not only of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, but also of
Milton	LOCATION	and
Shelley	PERSON	, of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, the note which has been conspicuously missing from the blatant mouthings of the latter-day singers of imperialism .

		We find it in `` The Empire-Builders , '' which thus begins and thus ends : '' Who are the Empire-bnilders ?

		They Whose desperate arrogance demands A self - reflecting power to sway A hundred little selfless lands ?

		Lord God of battles , ere we bow To these and to their soulless lust .

		Let fall thy thunders on us now And strike us equal to the dust . ''

		For hearts that to their home are true Where'er the tides of power may flow , Have built a kingdom great and new Which Time nor Fate shall overthrow ; These are the Empire builders , these Annex where none shall say them nay , Beyond the world 's uncharted seas .

		Realms that can never pass away . ''

		We find the same note in the fervent stanzas '' In Time of War . '' ''

		And here to us the eternal charge is given To rise and make our low world touch God 's high : To hasten God 's own Kingdom , Man 's own heaven , And teach Love 's grander army how to die . ''

		No kingdom then , no long-continuing city Shall e'er again be stablished by the sword ; No blood-bought throne defy the powers of pity .

		No despot 's crown outweigh one helot 's word . ''

		Imperial
England	LOCATION	, breathe thy marching orders : The great host waits ; the end , the end is close .

		When earth shall know thy peace in all her borders .

		And all her deserts blossom with thy Rose . ''

		The classical poems in this volume constitute an important gfroup .

		Even such worn themes as Orpheus and Pha6thon and Perseus receive a touch of fresh grace in this poet 's handling . ''

		The Last of the Titans , '' for example , tells of the Atlas myth , and of how the slayer of Medusa turned the giant to stone .

		Here is a fine passage descriptive of the
Titan	ORGANIZATION	's solitude . ''

		Beneath him , like a tawny panther-skin .

		The great
Sahara	LOCATION	slept : beyond it lay , Parcelled and plotted out like tiny fields .

		The princedoms and the kingdoms of this eartli , Mountains like frozen wrinkles on a sea , And seas like rain-pools in a rutted road Dwindling beneath his loneliness .

		Above The chariots of ten thousand thousand suns Conspired to make him lonelier , and rolled Their flaming wheels remote , so that they seemed , E'en Alioth and
Fomalhaut	LOCATION	, no more Than dust of diamonds in the abysmal gloom .

		So from a huger loneliness he gazed Over the world where , faint as morning mists Drifting thro ' shadowy battles on the hills .

		Drifting thro ' many a pageant touched with red , Cities of men and nations passed away . ''

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	is singularly happy in his lyrical mea - sures , and his song has the spontaneity of a bird 's carolling . ''

		When that I loved a maiden My heaven was in her eyes .

		And when they bent above me I knew no deeper skies ; But when her heart forsook me .

		My spirit broke its bars , For grief beyond the sunset And love beyond the stars . ''

		It is a true poet that we have represented by the above extracts , a poet of such rare quality as to mark him as the peer of the best among the younger generation .

		He is certainly of the rank of Mr ,
Phillips	PERSON	and Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, and he surpasses the former in freshness of vision , the latter in facility of utterance .

		A cultivated and reflective mind , dwelling upon themes of art , religion , history , and the legendary 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, past , finding for its thoughts and fancies a striking form of individual expression -- this is the substance of what is offered us by '' L. , '' in '' The Dark Ages and Other Poems . ''

		If not always poetical , the author has a vigorous form of speech that reaches its mark , as in this section of his titular poem . ''

		Men call you ' dark .

		* Was Chaucer 's speech a muddy stream , The language born of Norman sun and
Saxon	PERSON	snow ?

		Was
Langland	PERSON	's verse or
Wyclif	ORGANIZATION	's prose mere glow-worm 's gleam ?

		And the tales Of
Arthur	PERSON	's sword and of the Holy Grail ,
And Avalon	LOCATION	, the isle where no storms blow : From such romance did no light glance ?

		Have we not heard a tongue Whose word the
Saxon	PERSON	thralls Would scorn to speak above their muck-rake and their fork , The speech of barrack-rooms and music-halls , Where every fool has flung The rotten refuse of
Calcutta	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	? ''

		Here is a writer who knows what he thinks , and is not chary about saying it .

		Other pieces reveal a charm that is lacking in the above quotation , and of these '' The Bells of
Venice	LOCATION	'' may be taken as an example . ''

		Ring out again that faltering strain .

		Cease not so soon .

		Sweet peal that brought to me the thought Of some deep shadowed English lane Across the blue lagoon . ''

		The water street where oarsmen meet And shout ahead .

		The glowing quay , all noise and glee , Seemed hallowed as when angels ' feet Touched
Jacob	PERSON	's stony bed . ''

		On pearly dome and princely home Day 's glory dies : Once more the bells ' low murmur tells That faith is not a line of foam Nor life a bridge of sighs . ''

		The religious note here sounded is the one most characteristic of the author 's mood , and is reechoed in a majority of the pieces that make up his volume .

		A sort of vivid subjectivity , which makes it fairly clear that the verses are something more than fabrica - tions -- are in some degree the distillation of expe - rience -- is characteristic of `` The Dead Friendship , and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Litchfield Woods	PERSON	.

		We may illustrate this statement by quoting the deeply - felt stanzas entitled '' This My Heart . '' ''

		In this my heart I find a mimic world Of love and hate , and happiness and tears .

		The joys and sorrows of the earth lie furled Within its subtle deeps .

		With hopes and fears Its wide domain I conquer and explore , Of sin and goodness finding more and more In this my heart . ''

		In this my heart I stand upon the height .

		Where God his state in love and beauty keeps ; In this my heart I dwell in unstarred night Of sin and horror .

		Sinking to the deeps Of blackest Hell I find my spirit 's kin .

		There lies all beauty , love and hate and sin In this my heart . ''

		In this my heart are gardens of delight .

		And caverns vile of ruin and decay .

		With this my heart I plumb the darkest night .

		And span the brightness of a fairer day .

		There dwells enshrined a blessing and a curse , The beauty and horror of the universe .

		In this my heart . ''

		A strain of melancholy , and a tendency to brood over the darker aspects of life , lead us to suspect that Mr.
Woods	PERSON	is still a comparatively yoimg poet .

		Whether he has realized , or only anticipates , the evanescence of the flush of joy that comes with early years we are not prepared to say , but it is cer - tain that `` Youth 's Farewell '' expresses the mood of this critical transition in terms of singular beauty .

		The poem is too long to reproduce , save for its clos - ing stanzas . ''

		Ah !

		on her eyes in fondness dwell , Beyond those orbs is fairyland ; Ah !

		look and take a long farewell , Upon the fragile hand Breathe out thy yearning in a trembling kiss , Breathe out youth 's soul and so youth 's dreams dismiss . ''

		One long last kiss , one long last look Into those heart-compelling eyes , And youth is but a closed book .

		Life 's morning splendour dies ; Ne'er will return its rapture and its zest , Though oft desired in memory 's unrest . ''

		Ah !

		youth , thy moments fly too soon .

		Though pure and bright , yet brief the trance , Come turn thy face towards the noon , Bid farewell to romance ; The daylight grows , life 's morning rapture dies , Whilst others throng to feed upon those eyes . ''

		Of the sonnets in this volume we must quote one example , `` The Unattainable . '' ''

		With heart insurgent ` neath my clasped hands , With weary eyes on far horizons fed ; My spirit wanders in enchanted lands Where pale rose dawns and amber sunsets shed Eternal loveliness ; where all my dreams Walk with glad eyes the shining courts of gold ; And where my hopes , transfigured in the beams Of purest light , arise and cry , ' Behold , We give thee all the dreams of thy desire , Release thy spirit from its prison bars , Thou canst outsoar the sunset 's amber fire , Reap for thy soul the heavens ' wealth of stars ; And gaze forever with unwearied eyes On far horizons where new realms arise . ' ''

		This is one of some score of sonnets , all in the Shakespearian form , and all of unusual distinction .

		Miss
May Aldington	DATE	's verses are called `` Songs of Life and Love , '' the two terms being taken as coextensive , as far as this little volume reports . ''

		Love Watches '' is the name given to the following pair of stanzas . ''

		I watch the blue veins in your hands .

		With ever wondering longing ; I watch the red blood in your lips .

		And feel mj ' pulses throbbing . ''

		I watch the sea , the earth , the sun , God 's wonders in the making ; But for the love-light in your eyes , I watch with heart Ihat 's breaking . ''

		THE DIAL 63 To this lyrist , an assonance seems quite as good as a rhyme , and she freely uses it as a substitute .

		The two ladies who merge their separate indi - vidualities into the imagined character of `` Michael Field '' have earned for that name the sincere ap - plause of all lovers of poetry .

		For a quarter of a century volumes thus ascribed have made their appearance in a continuing series , and the latest of them , `` Wild Honey from Various Thyme , '' is no whit inferior to its predecessors .

		Here are nearly two hundred lyrics and sonnets , packed with thought , and arresting in their originality of expression .

		Let us take , to begin with , this truly Emersonian crys - tallization of an idea . ''

		But if our love be dying let it die As the rose shedding secretly , Or as a noble music 's pause : Let it move rhythmic as the laws Of the sea 's ebb , or the sun 's ritual When sovereignly he dies : Then let a mourner rise and three times call Upon our love , and the long echoes fall . ''

		Classical myths , sometimes set forth by bare de - scriptive process and sometimes moralized , are the subjects of a large number of these poems .

		We select '' Mintha '' for our illustration . ''

		Dusk Mintha , purple-eyed , I love thy story -- Where was the grove , Beneath what alder-strand , or poplar hoary Did silent Hades look to thee of love ?

		Mute wert thou , ever mute , nor did ` st thou start Affrighted from thy doom , but in thy heart Did ` st bury deep thy god .

		Persephone Passed thee by slowly on her way to hell ; And seeing Death so sore beloved of thee She sighed , and not in anger wrought the spell Fixed thee a plant , Of low , close blossom , of supprest perfume , And leaves that pant Urgent as if from spices of a tomb . ''

		The following sonnet is called '' Constancy , '' and the idea has rarely found as striking an expression . ''

		I love her with the seasons , with the winds , As the stars worship , as anemones Shudder in secret for the sun , as bees Buzz round an open flower : in all kinds My love is perfect , and in each she finds Herself the goal : then why , intent to teaze And rob her delicate spirit of its ease , Hastes she to range me with inconstant minds ?

		If she should die , if I were left at large On earth without her -- I , on earth , the same Quick mortal with a thousand cries , her spell She fears would break .

		And I confront the charge As sorrowing , and as careless of my fame As Christ intact before the infidel . ''

		One more sonnet , this time a pure interpretation of nature , shall end our extracts from this significant collection .

		It has '' Inept '' for a title . ''

		What is the burthen of this gold sunshine That burns across the wideness of decay , Or stamps its splendour on the forest pine .

		Or lifts -- a token torch -- one sweet-fern spray ?

		Why would it brand so deep ?

		The meadows spread Untamishable in their pomp of dew , Or frost , or clear meridian : overhead Droppeth the night ; but one must creep into The brake to hide one from the harvest moon .

		So wide she stares .

		Great stars that shed no boon Flame through the orchard apples laid in heaps .

		Why this profusion of
September	DATE	fire Poured where the thistle in the tilth grows higher , Laid over the broad fields where no man reaps ? ''

		Such work as this produces the gratifying effect of dry champagne upon a palate cloyed by the exces - sive sweetness of most ordinary verse .

		At discreet intervals during the last score of years Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	has put forth modest volumes of verse which have charmed thoughtful readers by their grace and sincerity .

		Now that we have the contents of these volumes -LRB- with a few additional pieces -RRB- brought within a single pair of covers , we realize with some surprise how great a quantity of good work the author has done , and how considerable a poet he is .

		This is clearly a case in which the effect of the whole is greater than the sum of the effects produced by the several parts .

		For one thing , the collective volume shows us the sur - prising breadth of the poet 's range .

		There are lyrics of nature and life , sage moralizings , and poems of personal and occasional character in great number and variety .

		Then there is the important group of poems inspired by patriotic and historical themes .

		And then , best of all to our liking , there are the many pieces which reveal the writer as a whole - hearted lover of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		We are going to quote '' Love in
Italy	LOCATION	'' as an exquisite example , although the lyric is now many years old , and is perhaps as familiar as anything Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has ever written . ''

		They halted at the terrace wall ; Below , the towered city lay ; The valley in the moonlight 's thrall Was silent in a swoon of
May	DATE	.

		As hand to hand spoke one soft word Beneath the friendly ilex-tree , They knew not , of the flame that stirred , What part was Love , what
Italy	LOCATION	. '

		• They knew what makes the moon more bright Where
Beatrice	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, -- The sweeter perfume in the
night	TIME	, The lovelier starlight in the star ; And more that glowing hour did prove , Beneath the sheltering ilex-tree , -- That
Italy	LOCATION	transfigures Love , As Love transfigures
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		And now let us associate with this song the closing stanzas of a poem only a few weeks old -- a poem in which the praise of
Italy	LOCATION	is conjoined with a tender tribute to a dead friend , '' To One Who Never Got to
Rome	LOCATION	, '' to
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	. ''

		The path to Adonais ' bed .

		That pilgrims ever smoother wear , Who could than you more fitly tread ?

		-- Or with more right from
Ariel	ORGANIZATION	dead The dark acanthus bear ? ''

		Alas !

		your footstep could not keep Your fond hope 's rendezvous , brave soul !

		Yet , if our last thoughts ere we sleep Be couriers across the deep To greet us at the goal , 64 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The heavenly vision that you see -- The towers on the sapphire hills , The song , the golden light -- fulfils Your dream of
Italy	LOCATION	! ''

		One of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's sonnets , * ' Waters of Song , '' may be reproduced as an illustration of the refine - ment and balanced grace of his work in general . ''

		Time was when
Avon	ORGANIZATION	's unrenownM stream , Save for its beauty , unregarded flowed ; Once Arno even as other rivers glowed , For then it had not mirrored
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's dream .

		How vague the gray Levantine sea did seem Ere Homer charted all the stormy road !

		The Psalmist who by Babylon abode Forever linked with grief the willow 's gleam . ''

		Think you there are no other waters fit To be rechristened with a poet 's name ?

		Is Nature bankrupt ?

		-- man 's last beacon lit ?

		Believe it never !

		Unborn bards such fame On undiscovered rivers may bestow As shall to fable banish Nile and Po . ''

		The '' Lyrics and Landscapes '' of Mr.
Harrison S. Morris	PERSON	are neat and decorous compositions , not ex - actly inspired , but mildly pleasing .

		These verses on '' Beach Peas '' may be quoted .

		* ' Here , where the sand and the sea
Caress	ORGANIZATION	, and forever embrace .

		You have bloomed , as a child that may be The fruit of their race . ''

		You were bom to the drench of the salt .

		To the murmur of waves in the
night	TIME	.

		To the scream of gulls through the vault , And to foam that falls white . ''

		For the purple you wear in your hood , And the lace of your leaves , are a sign You are sprung of imperial blood -- Tho ' of lowlier line . ''

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	strikes his deepest note in '' Destiny , '' a Phi Beta Kappa poem , although we regret to find in these dignified verses a veiled apology for our latter - day American imperialism .

		Mr.
Clinton ScoUard	PERSON	is by way of becoming the most voluminous of our poets -LRB- with Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	for a close competitor -RRB- , if we reckon by the number of his volumes .

		The latest of the long series is called '' Voices and Visions . ''

		We reproduce this lyric of the springtide . ''

		There 's necromancy still !

		The rathe marsh-marigold An Ophir makes of yonder oozy mold ; Slim branches erewhile stark and dark and chill , -- The wild wayfaring-tree , ^ -LRB- Oh , wondrous wizardry ! -RRB-

		Offer a fragrant Hybla where the bee

		Care must attend whatever path you tread , Lest your foot crush some fair and fragile head .

		Shatter white innocence , leave budding hope Bruised on the dewy slope .

		But yester night All the wide earth lay barren of delight That now is splendid-bright before the sight .

		And so , my masters , say whatso you will .

		There 's necromancy still i '' Of such pretty futilities as this is the book made up -- songs of nature and love , and new echoes of the author 's Oriental sojournings .

		Is Mr.
ScoUard	PERSON	to be the founder of a
Clinton	PERSON	school of poets ?

		For here is another volume from that vicinage , bearing the title `` From Happy Valleys , '' and written by Mr.
Thomas S. Jones	PERSON	, Jr. .

		This '' Nocturne '' exemplifies the author 's quiet and graceful manner . ''

		Sleep after love is done -- afar the west Smiles softly , though the sun has sunk to rest -- Ah , this were best ; The flaming noon-hour we shall never know , No more , the glow . ''

		Sleep after love is done and peace at last .

		Beyond , the wind-swept sea , the stormy blast , All , all is past ; The harbor calm , the ships home from the deep , And we , asleep I '' Mr.
Jones	PERSON	is a poet of nature , and has felt the soothing ministi-ies of woods and fields and skies .

		His verse , moreover , is freighted with enough of imagination to be truly significant of the life of the spirit .

		We have had occasion to speak words of praise concerning the two earlier volumes of verse by Mrs.
Helen Hay Whitney	PERSON	, and her new book of '' Gypsy Verses '' shows that delicate sensibility and subtle emotion are still at her command .

		The following exquisite little poem is called '' Ghosts . '' ''

		The long lost lights of love I know , They thrill from ultimate space , they blow Like small bewildered stars , tossed high On some unknown and passionate sky . ''

		I know them for the loved lost lights That made the glamour of my nights Long , long ago , and now I fear Their coming , and the garb they wear . ''

		For they are very white and cold , They are not coloured as of old .

		In trailing radiance , rose and red .

		For these are ghosts , and they are dead . ''

		There is imaginative distinction in these verses , and in many of the others that keep them company .

		Ralegh 's devotional stanzas on * ' His Pilgrim - age '' supply Miss
Caroline Hazard	PERSON	with the title , '' A Scallop Shell of Quiet , '' which she has given to her own volume of devotional verse .

		Most of the pieces are sonnets , and '' Seed-Time '' may be taken to represent them . ''

		A living green has touched the swelling hills , And tiny birds chirp in the leafless trees ; Up from the ocean comes a vernal breeze That brings the showers to feed the mountain rills .

		In dark red soil the steady ploughman drills The long deep furrows , sinking to his knees In spongy earth ; it is no time of ease , -- With signs of birth and promise Nature thrills .

		Drive Thou Thy plough ,
Lord	LOCATION	, deep in my heart , Hardened beneath a load of petty cares ; Break up its guilty crust , and freely start The showers of Thy grace , then sow some seed Whose ripened harvest Thou wilt deign to heed .

		And husband it with g ^ racious heavenly airs . ''

		These lines are typical of the feeling which charac - terizes Miss Hazard 's verse , lending it the grace of a deep sincerity .

		THE DIAL 65 Briefs on New Books .

		New studies of ^ here are certain authors whose
Blake	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, stability and discrimination in judg -
Scott	LOCATION	,
Shelley	LOCATION	, ment are always assured ; we recog - nize their distinct merits and limitations , and are seldom disappomted in their products .

		Sometimes such evenness , especially in a critical essayist , sug - gests a craftsman rather than a scholar ; but a tone of earnest appreciation quite counteracts any such mechanical effects .

		Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	has achieved the skill of the craftsman , without losing his individual traits as a critic with a keen perception of literary art .

		His earlier studies of
Browning	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	have been followed by other volumes in uniform style , covering a wider range of subjects .

		His new '' Studies in Poetry '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- include essays on
Blake	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and three on
Shelley	PERSON	.

		The studies of Shelley impress the reader as the most vital , and they seem to furnish the special reason for the book .

		If the tone of the '' Inaugural Address to the Shelley Society '' is occasionally open to censure for petulance in recalling the comparisons which have been made between
Shelley	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	, the later pages of the essay are sound in balanced criticism on both poets .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	emphasizes his admiration for
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's lyrics in this inaugural address , and expands the hints there stated into a worthy essay on the same subject .

		He justly calls attention to
Shelley	PERSON	's absorbing impulses of thought and emotions which left their impress not only on the shorter lyrics but also in lyrical outbursts in many of the dramas , notably '' Prometheus , '' '' HeUas , '' and '' Epipsychidion . ''

		A separate essay is devoted to the last-mentioned personal poem .

		There are some new interpretative thoughts and fitting re - phrasing 6f recognized qualities of mind and soul in the detailed analyses of `` The Cloud '' and `` Ode to the West Wind . ''

		Two distinctive traits of
Shelley	PERSON	are summarized as '' the power of making fresh myths out of nature , and that of describing nature imaginatively and yet with scientific truth . ''

		Keats and
Shelley	PERSON	suggest to most critics both resem - blance and divergence .

		The author has here traced the mental isolation of
Keats	PERSON	from the political and material struggles of his age , his reversion to ideals and symbols of classic and mediaeval beauty , and his childlike sensibility to nature .

		With almost ecstatic praise he commends his best odes as `` above criticism , pure gold of poetry -- virgin gold . ''

		The publication of the complete poems of
William Blake	PERSON	in a new edition two years ago re-awakened interest in this painter-poet who was both visionary and radical and whose recognition has come so slowly .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	has studied
Blake	PERSON	's lyrical poetry in relation to the development of English literature ; he has also emphasized his spiritual love of nature , which made him a true precursor of
Wordsworth	PERSON	.


Blake	PERSON	's poetic passion informed and beautified many of his meditations on the political , social , and relig - ious problems of his day .

		The quotations which reveal the poet 's childlike yet progressive nature are well chosen from '' Poetical Sketches , '' '' Songs of Innocence , '' and '' Songs of Experience . ''

		Many a reader in middle life will echo the sentence in the essay on Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, '' I am sorry for the chil - dren who are not brought up on the poetry of Scott . ''

		With just appreciation , this poetry is extolled for its power of kindling romantic feelings and imaginative delights over past scenes , and for awakening fervor to learn more of historic scenes , heroic characters , and knightly ideals .

		Chapters in ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ instalment -LRB- Volume III . -RRB-

		the struggle for of Professor
James MacKinnon	PERSON	's human liberty , u History of Modem Liberty '' -LRB- Long - mans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the first two volumes of which were reviewed in The Dial a year ago , deals with the struggle with the Stuarts in
England	LOCATION	and
Scot	PERSON	- land in the seventeenth century , and is a continua - tion of an ambitious task already well advanced ; namely , the tracing of the historical development of liberty in modern times .

		The first volume , it may be repeated , was of an introductory character , being limited to a review of the origin and results of the movements for political and social emancipation in the middle ages .

		The second volume dealt primarily with the intellectual and religious movements as exemplified in the Renaissance and Reformation and their results upon the political and social life of the time .

		The present volume is to be followed by five others , concluding with the revolutionary and eman - cipation movements in the nineteenth century .

		The scene of the struggle described in the earlier volumes was mainly on the continent ; after that it was shifted to
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, where the new impulse received its most powerful expression .

		There the contest began with the opposition of parliament to the arbitrary rule of
James I.	PERSON	, was continued during the reign of
Charles II.	PERSON	, included the opposition to the '' military despotism '' of
Cromwell	PERSON	, and ended with the abdication of James II .

		The struggle was marked by such incidents as
Milton	LOCATION	's plea for intel - lectual freedom , the efforts of
Roger Williams	PERSON	,
William Penn	PERSON	,
John Locke	PERSON	, and others , in behalf of toleration , and the demand of certain obscure sects for social as well as religious emancipation .

		In
Great Britain	LOCATION	the struggle produced important re - sults ; it gave her the first place among the full countries of
Europe	LOCATION	, transformed her into a land of refuge for the exiles of other nations , and helped to foster '' those larger aspirations which resulted in the widening of political rights , the broadening of intellectual and religious liberty , and contributed to engender that free self-consciousness , that spirit of daring enterprise , which led to the expansion of British power and the establishment of free common - wealth beyond the British shores . ''

		The same criti - cism which was directed against the earlier volumes may be made of the present one ; namely , that much of the story deals only in a remote degree with liberty , and that the author 's failure to cite his authorities detracts from the value of the work to serious students of history .

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	,

Charles 0 / Chatterton	PERSON	's
Edward Russell	PERSON	undertook the study life and work .

		jj #
Chatterton	PERSON	's strangely puzzling life and literary work .


Bristol	LOCATION	, the boy-poet 's home , the British Museum , the Bodleian Library , and all other sources of possible information about his sub - ject , have been visited by the biographer , and all extant documentary evidence has been examined ; and as a result we now have a handsomely printed and illustrated volume entitled '' Thomas Chatter - ton , the Marvelous Boy '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In his very preface Mr.
Russell	PERSON	damages his case by claiming too much .

		Not only does he roundly deny that
Chatterton	PERSON	was guilty of literary forgery , but he pronounces his writings '' works of the first order of genius , works ever since the marvel of all persons that have considered them , works profoundly affecting the body and the development of English poetry . ''

		With a lurking fear , however , that he may not have succeeded in proving his client 's in - nocence and in shifting all the blame on to the antiquary-surgeon
Barrett	PERSON	and the hard-hearted
Horace Walpole	PERSON	, he amusingly adds that if the wonderful boy was a literary forger he had tempta - tion enough and excuse enough , and we ought now to forgive him and remember only his lovable qualities and his undisputed literary genius .

		The lovable qualities we can admire without being told , on what authority does not appear , that whenever he passed the throng of beggars in front of
Colston	ORGANIZATION	's school , on his way to get a book from the circulating library , '' he emptied his pockets among them , '' and so denied himself the book for which his soul was thirsting , and so also found himself compelled to carry more parchments , genuine or forged , to Surgeon
Barrett	PERSON	. ''

		On a calm survey , '' says the author , as if forgetting that he is washing
Chatterton	PERSON	as white as snow , '' the only real amazement will be that this boy did nothing worse than palm off his counterfeit antiques upon two foolish men . ''

		The advocate protests too much ; he lacks the calmness of conviction , and so fails to convince the reader .

		The interest , too , of his story -- and
Chatterton	PERSON	's life can never fail to be interesting -- suffers from its disputatious tone ; it is told with an emphasis that seems to leave no reserve forces behind .


Masson	PERSON	's short and pathetic account , which Mr.
Russell	PERSON	makes no mention of in his references to previous biog - raphers , is more effective than this later , more elaborate , and undoubtedly better-informed work , although the thoroughness with which the author prepared himself for it is worthy of high praise .

		A new brief biography of Foe , '' As we are human , '' writes Mr.
John Macy	PERSON	in beginning his life of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, in the '' Beacon Biog - raphies '' series -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , '' we crave to know when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was married , arid on what occasions
Poe	PERSON	befuddled his fine brain ; but the
Poe	PERSON	that lives is the dreamer of dreams imaged in the pensive head that adorns the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Sympathy with poets , the writer further declares , should transcend defense of their private morals .

		Perhaps so ; but even with the best of endeavors to maintain the cool literary temper , a warmer human interest will make the reader regret
Byron	PERSON	's irregularities ,
Shelley	PERSON	's untenderness to his first wife , and
Poe	PERSON	's lack of manly self-control .

		This very natural interest of ours in a poet as a human being Mr.
Macy	PERSON	recognizes so far as to touch on the main facts of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's troubled life ; and of the weak - ness that chiefly caused it to be troubled he says an illuminating word .

		Correcting those who call
Poe	PERSON	's infirmity alcoholism or dipsomania , he says : '' Alcoholism is disease resulting from excessive drinking : anyone may develop it with perseverance .

		Dipsomania is an uncontrollable thirst for alcohol : it exists as a disease , even if the thirst is not gratified .

		There is yet a third condition which can exist with - out excessive or continuous indulgence and without an initial morbid craving .

		Under this condition the ' patient ' is affected by alcohol and other drugs as if he were a cold-blooded animal .

		There is imme - diate unbalance , hysteria , insanity , a poisoned con - dition .

		Such , according to the evidence , was the effect of liquor on
Poe	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Macy	PERSON	's essay -- for it is , of necessity , hardly more -- dwells rather on
Poe	PERSON	the short-story writer than on
Poe	PERSON	the poet .

		The short story , moreover , he unhesitatingly pronounces '' the only type of literature to which
America	LOCATION	has made a considerable contribution of distinguished quality . ''

		Has anyone noted the curious parallelism between
Poe	PERSON	and
Whistler	LOCATION	in their whimsical fibbing over birth-place and birth-year ?

		Each falsely claimed
Baltimore	LOCATION	as birthplace , and both were shy about giving their age .

		Both , too , were for a brief space students at
West Point	LOCATION	, if history is to be believed .

		This last is noted by Mr.
Macy	PERSON	.

		His little book sustains the general excellence of the series to which it belongs .

		The volume opens with six letters written home
last autumn	DATE	from
Lake Leman	PERSON	, fifty-six years after the writer 's first visit to the Alps in his student days .

		It is cheering to find Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	still as keen as ever for a tramp -LRB- if not too arduous -RRB- in the moun - tains , and far more appreciative of their charms than in his youth , rich in adventure and ever fresh delights though those early days of summit-scaling are acknowledged to have been .

		The middle altitudes must now content him , but what they have to offer was largely missed in those former mad scrambles to reach the topmost peaks .

		But even in that far - off time of half a century ago Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	was no unobservant mountain-climber .

		Two articles written

		THE DIAL 67 in the sixties and reprinted at the end of the little book show him to have had a quick eye and a reflec - tive mind for all that the Alps had to offer .

		Of course the volume does not close without due men - tion of and tribute to the late
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, his feUow-member in the
Alpine Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		Besides dedi - cating the book to his memory , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	republishes his '' CornhiU '' article written on the occasion of
Stephen	PERSON	's death . ''

		The Playground of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' we are glad to notice , is praised as its author 's most characteristic and fascinating work .

		One sentence from Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's final chapter may be quoted as striking the keynote of the book : '' We need sometimes that poetry should be not droned into our ears , but flashed into our senses . ''

		The creed of ^ ^ ®
Thomas Paine	PERSON	, who said , `` My a citizen of country is the world , and my religion the world .

		ig to ^ o good , '' Professor
Charles Zueblin	PERSON	allows himself to be fettered by no preju - dices of race or creed -- so far as freedom from preju - dice is possible .

		His little book , '' The Religion of a Democrat '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , is the most untheological treatise imaginable : the religion it treats of is extrar ecclesiastical , if not anti-theological , and appears to be contained in some form of socialism .

		Positivism , says the author , '' has had its day ; ethical culture still illumines the way , but the future seems to be - long to some form of socialism .

		If the democratic state is at all to realize the dreams of sober collec - tivists , and to avoid the dangers pointed out by the honest critics of socialism , it will be by the organi - zation of its ethical forces , in harmony with its other elements . ''

		The truly religious person of this ideal democracy is not to cherish hopes of a future state of celestial bliss , but to be sustained and strength - ened by a belief in '' impersonal immortality , '' which means '' the perpetuation of oneself through the individuals , the institutions , and the ideals , of the years to come . ''

		Furthermore , `` the people are to redeem themselves .

		Our ashes fertilize the soil from which life springs , but souls also kindle souls .

		I do not know when my Redeemer will live , or whose Redeemer I may be , except in the sense in which every man is our Redeemer and we are his Re - deemer ... The redemption of the people will be by means of impersonal immortality , -- the crux of democratic religion . ''

		Although the scheme of salvation by legislation must seem a little hard and mechanical , the atmosphere of the book is fresh and free and bracing , and the author 's forcible presenta - tion of the imperishability of personal influence will doubtless inspire others with a wish to '' join the choir invisible .

		As six out of these eight institu - tions are co-educational , the book may serve in a measure to answer also the question , '' Which college for the girl ? ''

		But no one , the author probably least of all , would claim that the little volume gives a final answer to either of these important questions .

		The social and athletic sides of college life receive from him more attention than the academic , and there is rather greater emphasis placed on the defects than on the excellences of the several institutions he has selected .

		The chapters are highly readable , and the style in which they are written is sufficiently enlivened with student wit and college slang .

Oxford	LOCATION	, and his visits at a large number of American universities and colleges , qualify him to speak with authority on cer - tain aspects of college life ; and if the careful parent wishes to learn something about the peculiar tempta - tions his son will be exposed to at any of the uni - versities in Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	's list , the socual advantages he will enjoy , the athletic sports most in vogue , and -LRB- in a general way -RRB- the departments of learning most successfully cultivated , he will do well to read this attractive , well-illustrated book .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		M. Andr ^
Tardieu	PERSON	is the latest of our European critics .

		His `` Notes sur les Etats-Unis '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Calmann-Levy -RRB- are neither extensive nor profound , but , coming from the pen of a literary Frenchman , they make a readable book .

		M.
Tardieu	PERSON	seems to have had the usual experience of the visiting foraigner who comes armed with letters to public functionaries and social leaders .

		He was shown the obvious sights , and makes the obvious comments upon them .

		His special themes are society , politics , and diplomacy , and his observations are confined mainly to
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, and Wash - ington .

		The book exhibits a good deal of timeliness , dealing at length , as it does , with such recent matters as the Japanese imbroglio -LRB- which is taken far too seri - ously -RRB- , the panic of last
Autmnn	PERSON	, and the earlier stages of the now pending presidential campaign .

		We believe that Mr.
Morley	PERSON	is henceforth to be called
Viscount Morley	PERSON	of
Blackburn	LOCATION	, and we expect hereafter to give him his proper title , but there seems to be no need of our doing so in mentioning the fourth volume of his '' Miscellanies '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which still prints plain ''
John Morley	PERSON	'' upon the title-page .

		We pre - sume this is done to secure uniformity with the earlier volumes .

		The present book is a collection of papers reprinted from various sources , and the author 's friends doubtless know them already , although they are doubt - less also glad to have them in this permanent shape .


Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Guicciardini	LOCATION	, Mill , and
Lecky	PERSON	are the subjects of four of the essays .

		These , with three others , make up an '' Eversley '' volume like the old ones , only the paper seems les `` soft and flexible .

		They will also publish an elaborately illustrated book by Miss
Elisabeth Luther Cary	PERSON	entitled '' Artists Past and Present . ''

		A leading place among the coming season 's publica - tions will undoubtedly be taken by the authorized biog - raphy of

Whistler	LOCATION	, which Miss
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	and Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	have long been working upon .

		The
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish the work in two large and elaborately-illustrated volumes .

		Very little has hitherto been written about that inter - esting and quaint people , the Servians .


Messrs. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish shortly a work entitled '' Servia and the Servians , '' by

		NOTES 93 THE GRANDI SONI AN MANNER .

		In a paper from the pen of Lady Grove , published recently in the
London	LOCATION	'' Chronicle , '' comment is made on the withdrawal of certain gentlemen from the '' mixed '' clubs -LRB- `` cock and hen '' clubs is the current slang term -RRB- to which they had belonged , and which they had joined while the clubs were still exclusively for men , but which they had left in high dudgeon at the subsequent admission of women -- an innovation that they held to be destructive of the very raison d'etre of club life .

		That is , these gen - tlemen , one might argue , had joined their clubs in order to escape the amenities of polite society , and felt themselves aggrieved when called upon to observe those amenities .

		An acquaintance of ours who has no home ties and no fixed hab - itation of her own deplores her lot because she finds it irksome , as perpetual boarder or guest in other people 's houses , to wear always her '' company manners . ''

		This hatred of formality , this ever-present tendency to revert to primitive unconvention - ality -LRB- and primitive savagery -RRB- , is neither wholly bad nor wholly good ; but in this rapidly-moving twentieth century of ours , when we fancy we have hardly time to be polite , the obvious dan - ger is that too little attention will be paid to the cultivation of the minor morals , of the suave and gracious manners that bespeak a cultured leisure .

		What better corrective to the rude haste , the selfish scramble , of a money-making age could be devised than a deliberate reading , or re-reading , of '' Sir
Charles Grandison	PERSON	'' ?

		From one who '' taught the passions to move at the command of virtue , '' as
Johnson	PERSON	said of
Richardson	PERSON	, the reader may take a lesson in the ordering of his daily walk and conversation .

		Nothing is too trivial to be treated with dig - nity and gravity by the excellent printer-author . ''

		In these small instances , '' he makes one of his minor personages say , `` are the characters of the heart displayed far more than in greater . ''

		To the men and women of
Richardson	PERSON	's novels the little things of life are abundantly worth while .

		They hurry over nothing , they slight nothing .

		An old lady of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's acquaintance always chose '' Sir
Charles Gran	PERSON	- dison '' to be read to her as she sat in her elbow 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, chair , because she knew that were she to fall asleep in the course of the reading she should lose nothing of the story , but should find the party where she left them , -- conversing in '' the cedar parlour . ''

		In the important things of life , as in courtship and marriage , the stately delib - eration is marvellous to behold .

		In paying his addresses to
Harriet Byron	PERSON	, Sir Charles makes his advances by parallels , beginning with the estimable grandmother and redoubling his cau - tion as he approaches the citadel itself .

		His delicacy causes him to doubt whether Miss
Byron	PERSON	will pardon , or should be permitted to pardon , an earlier passion cherished by him for the unfortunate
Clementina	PERSON	della Porretta .

		But he takes Miss
Byron	PERSON	's hand , and is bowing over it at page 65 of the sixth volume ; at page 81 the actual offer of marriage begins , and it extends to page 89 , the suitor talking almost uninterruptedly the while and -LRB- it is needless to add -RRB- expressing himself in admirable English .

		The priggishness of our paragon of a hero is of course undeniable , if one chooses to dwell on that aspect of his character .

		His delicacy amounts , to some readers , almost to effeminacy ; and hence he has been maliciously styled one of the author 's principal female characters .

		Even the heroine finds fault with his faidtlessness . ''

		A most intolerable superiority ! ''

		she exclaims ; '' I wish he would do something wrong , some - thing cruel . ''

		That is only uttered , however , under an overpowering sense of her own inferi - ority , or imagined inferiority .

		It is significant that
Richardson	PERSON	at fii-st intended to call his book '' The Good Man . ''

		That it purifies the heart and refines the manners to commune with the virtuous char - acters depicted by the author of '' Pamela '' has been often enough asserted by his admirers .

		Diderot even found in
Richardson	PERSON	's novels an intellectual stimulus of a high order . ''

		I have observed , '' he declares , '' that in a company where the works of
Richardson	PERSON	are being read , either privately or aloud , the conversation at once becomes more interesting and animating . ''

		Diderot 's seventeen pages of glowing evdogy in the Journal Etranger -- a panegjo-ic inspired by the recent death of the novelist -- can no longer be taken seriously ; yet there is some - thing rather pleasing in finding this keen-witted Frenchman so overcome with admiration for the worthy Englishman that he vows he will part with other portions of his library if he must , but
Richardson	PERSON	he will keep -- on the same shelf with
Moses	PERSON	,
Homer	ORGANIZATION	,
Euripides	LOCATION	, and Sophocles ; and he will read them by turns .

		There is an old-world charm in the very formality with which
Richardson	PERSON	's characters address one another .

		Even to his sisters
Grandi	PERSON	- son is always '' Sir
Charles	PERSON	, '' and they are not accosted by him as plain
Charlotte	LOCATION	or
Caroline	PERSON	, but as '' sister
Charlotte	LOCATION	, '' or `` my dear
Caro	PERSON	- line . ''


Charlotte	LOCATION	, on her part , habitually calls her elder sister '' Lady L , '' and her brother - in-law is either '' Lord L '' or '' my lord . ''

		All the more amusing , as well as surprising , is it to catch
Miss Grandison	PERSON	, in a moment of excessive familiarity and self-forgetfulness , ex - claiming , '' Such another word ,
Harriet	PERSON	, and I 'll blow you up ! ''

		Again we detect her using the slang expression , `` I 'll be hanged if -- , '' an unseemliness for which the exemplary Miss
Harriet	PERSON	fails not to call her to account in a gentle way .

		But by far the most edifying passages in the book are found in the conversations that Sir Charles carries on with the various characters of the story .

		Upon his father 's death what could be more praiseworthy than the judicious resolve , concerning both parents , thus expressed to his cousin Everard : '' I will have an elegant but not sumptuous monument erected to the memory of both , with a modest inscription that shall rather be matter of instruction to the living than a panegyric on the departed .

		The funeral shall be decent , but not ostentatious . ''

		And the fol - lowing , from a young man in his twenties , is unexceptionable -LRB- Sir
Charles	PERSON	is addressing his two sisters and Miss
Harriet Byron	PERSON	-RRB- : '' Our passions may be made subservient to excellent purposes .

		Don * t think you have a supercilious brother .

		A susceptibility of the passion called Zove , I condemn not as a fault ; but the contrary .

		Your brother ^ ladies , -LRB- looking upon all three , -RRB- is no Stoic . ''

		In the end , of course , he gracefully yields to his '' susceptibility of the passion called Zot ; e , '' and succeeds , with one entire volume to do it in , in getting married to the admirable
Harriet	PERSON	; but lest even then he should have left on the reader 's mind some impression of un - seemly haste , he takes still another volume to make his exit from the stage in a leisurely and graceful and dignified manner .

		That he would never suffer his horses ' tails to be docked is one , and a not insignificant , claim to our approval of Sir Charles .

		No smallest occasion to show his humanity was neglected by him ; and he found ways , some of them rather extraordinary , to do good and to smooth the path of life for others .

		For a profligate uncle he finds an excellent and suitable wife , having before that preached so moving and improving a ser -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 mon to his errant kinsman on the wickedness of his conduct that the sinner gives vent to his feeling of remorse in the following somewhat sur - prising manner : '' ' By my soul , ' said he , and clapped his two lifted-up hands together , ' I hate your father : I never heartily loved him ; but now I hate him more than ever I did in my
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	. ' '' '

		My lord ! '

		`` < < Do n't be surprised .

		I hate him for keeping so long abroad a son who would have converted us both ... O my sister , how have you blessed me in your son . ' ''

		A most striking illustration of Sir
Charles	PERSON	's unfailing graciousness of demeanor even in very trying situations is furnished by a letter that he wrote to his spendthrift father , just after that dissipated gentleman had applied to his son for consent to raise money -LRB- to pay a gambling debt -RRB- by mortgaging a part of the family estate .

		The son most magnanimously and respectfully replies : '' Why , sir , did you condescend to write to me on the occasion , as if for my consent ?

		Why did you not send me the deeds ready to sign ?

		Let me beg of you , ever dear and ever honored sir , that you will not suffer any difBculties , that I can join to remove , to oppress your heart with doubts for one moment ... Permit me , sir , to add , that , be my income ever so small , I am resolved to live within it .

		And let me beseech you to remit me but one half of your present bounty . ''

		Let it be admitted without dispute that
Grandison	PERSON	is to us a highly unreal , impossible , and even ridiculous character , endowed as he is with every virtue , every grace , and every worldly advantage , that a fairy godmother could have bethought her to bestow upon him at birth , and exhibiting his perfections with an elaborate mock-modesty through seven closely-printed volumes .

		Nevertheless , if the reader of a less naively sentimental age will but take up the book in a spirit of indulgence and not let his sense of humor get the better of his good - humor , he may possibly find himself not wholly unbenefitted by a leisurely perusal of the story in aU its pitiless length .

		A month of one 's spare hours might be passed in far worse com - pany than that of the dramatis personce so amusingly enumerated at the beginning of the work under the headings , '' Men , '' '' Women , '' and '' Italians . ''

		An unknown work by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has recently been dis - covered , and will probably be included in an edition of his unpublished pieces which is now in preparation .

		The title of the new discovery is '' Song at Akershus , ''
Aker	ORGANIZATION	- shiis being the name of a fortress in
Christiania	LOCATION	.

		It dates from
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's early years , and is in form a roman - tic tale .

		A plan for transforming
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's house into an Ibsen museum has been put forward of late , and is said to have met with support .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The rapturous quality in literature is what all readers hunger for as they take up each succes - sive '' book of the year '' or phenomenal '' best seller , '' but the rapture does not always follow .

		The older and sadder and wiser we grow , the less easily are we ravished by current sensational fiction , however great and however increasing may be our calm delight in our favorite old authors .

		It is with some interest and pleasure , therefore , that we hear from
London	LOCATION	an instance of undoubted ravishment . ''

		The Blue Lagoon , '' by Mr.
A. De Vere Stacpoole	PERSON	-- a book regarded by Mr.
Jacob Tonson	PERSON	as emphatically '' the book of the season '' -- was taken up one night by a literary woman of good taste and judgment as she was combing her hair before going to bed .

		She began to read , and when , an hour and a half later , she came to herself and laid the book down , she found herself still seated before her dressing table , comb in hand , having scarcely moved in all that interval of rapt delight .

		This involuntary tribute the teller of the story pronounces to b ^ one `` which could not perhaps be surpassed in all the history of criticism . ''

		But it is surpassed by at least one other instance .

		Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	was once travelling in the country when , at an inn where he chanced to stop for the night , he hit upon a copy of
Johnson	PERSON	's '' Life of Savage , '' then just published ; and he began to read it without so much as sitting down , but stood by the fire with the book in one hand and his arm resting on the mantelpiece .

		When he at last finished his reading and returned to the world about him , he found his arm quite stif - fened and benumbed by its long continuance in one position .

		... The conscience op the book-borrower is well known to be as easy as an old shoe in the matter of returning borrowed books ; and the return of public library books -- if it were not for the necessity of returning them in order to get others , and if it were not also for the prick of the two-cents-a-day fine on over-due volumes -- might well become the exception rather than the rule with many a thoughtless user of the free library .

		It is not , however , the ordinary little-reflective reader-for-pleasure who alone inclines to sin in the thoughtless retention of books over-time ; librarians themselves , as Mr.
Andrews	PERSON	of the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	remarked at the library meeting at
Minnetonka	LOCATION	, are not noted for promptness in return - ing borrowed books .

		Conspicuously dilatory , too , are the privileged patrons of college and university libraries .

		We have had personal experience of faculty members retaining library books for six months , and even a year , without so much as a blush of shame when requested to consider the rights of others .

		One amusing , and it is to be hoped wholesomely instruc - tive , incident comes to mind .

		One of these un - punctual borrowers came to the library in hot quest of a much-needed volume , and was thrown into a fever of vexation and impatience on being told that 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, it was out .

		Nothing would do but that the record of the book should be looked up at once and the book itself called in as soon as possible under the rules .

		Search was accordingly made , and the volume was found charged -LRB- under an ancient date -RRB- to the appli - cant himself .

		... The lat # dean of American dramatists ,
Bronson Howard	PERSON	, who has just died in his sixty-sixth year , was the prolific author of unusually popular and successful plays .

		Probably his '' Shenandoah '' has been witnessed by more play-goers throughout the country than any other drama now on the stage , with the exception of '' Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin , '' which still travels the backwoods circuit to the unfailing delight of rural audiences .

		That Mr.
Howard	PERSON	was capable of even better work than he furnished so abundantly and acceptably at the call of theatre - managers and star-actors , has been thought by more than one observer of his rise from inconspicuous journalism to international fame as a playwright .

		Other noted plays of his , besides '' Shenandoah , '' that readily come to mind are '' The
Henrietta	PERSON	, '' '' Diamonds , '' '' The Banker 's Daughter , '' '' Aris - tocracy , '' and -LRB- among his later dramas -RRB- ``
Peter Stuyvesant	PERSON	, '' which he wrote in collaboration with Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, and ''
Kate	PERSON	, '' written only two years ago .

		That the American stage should , in quick succession , have suffered the loss of its most gifted and scholarly actor ,
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	, and of its most experienced and success - ful playwright ,
Bronson Howard	PERSON	, is cause for deep regret .

		.

		, .

		Old-time literary
New England	LOCATION	loses another link in the chain connecting it with the present , in the death of Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	, at her home in
Boston	LOCATION	, on the 10th of the present month .

		Born in
Connecticut	LOCATION	in
1835	DATE	, Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's literary activities began almost with the beginning of the half-century and continued until near the time of her death .

		She was a prolific writer of stories and poems for the magazines , and of literary criticisms for vari - ous publications ; while her published volumes in prose and verse number some twenty titles .

		Her work as editor was also notable , including a collec - tion of the poems of
Philip Bourke Marston	PERSON	, to which she prefixed a touching and appreciative memoir ; and she rendered a similar service for
Arthur O'Shaughnessy	PERSON	, the Irish poet .

		Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's own poems are marked by sincerity and artistic skill , and in all she did she showed herself a cultivated and conscientious literary worker .

		Few indeed are now left of the group of
New England	LOCATION	writers to which Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	belonged .

		... The public library and the children are , between them , producing a lively centre of literary activity at
Cleveland	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, where , under the com - petent direction of Librarian
Brett	PERSON	, the intellectual needs of young readers are being administered to in a variety of novel and effective ways .

		An attractive , instructive , well-illustrated , and thoroughly interest - ing pamphlet or '' hand-book '' was prepared by the
Library Board	ORGANIZATION	, primarily for the information of the attendants at the late annual convention of the Na - tional
Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	in
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and also for the citizens interested in the library work going on among their children ; and this hand-book , entitled `` The Work of the
Cleveland	LOCATION	Public Library with the Children , '' is now , through Librarian
Brett	PERSON	's kind - ness , offered to such of our subscribers as choose to ask for it . ''

		The work as outlined in this hand - book , '' vtrrites Mr.
Brett	PERSON	in a personal letter , `` repre - sents various phases of its development here , but in many instances it is not peculiar to our library . ''

		Enough , however , is peculiar and original to make the pamphlet a notable contribution to the literature of public library administration .

		The chapter on `` Home Libraries , '' of which there were thirty-two in operation last year , reveals some especially novel features .

		... The death of
Katharine Prescott Wormeley	PERSON	occurred at her
summer	DATE	home in
Jackson	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	,
August 4	DATE	, at the age of seventy-eight .

		Miss
Worme	PERSON	- ley was much more than the translator of the standard English version of Balzac and the first to popularize the great French novelist in
America	LOCATION	.

		Finer and nobler than her work as translator and biographer was her service in the cause of charity and of girls * education .

		Though she was born in
England	LOCATION	, she warmly espoused the cause of her adopted country during our Civil War , and was a leader in the work of the
United States Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		A his - tory of that
Commission	ORGANIZATION	and its work , and a later book called `` The Other Side of War , '' are relics of this period of her life .

		The Girls ' Industrial School at
Newport	LOCATION	, founded by her and maintained at her own risk for three years , after which it was incorpo - rated with the city 's public school system , is another monument to her philanthropic zeal .

		Perhaps Miss Wormeley 's distinguishing characteristic was sym - pathy and appreciation : the ability to enter heartily into the spirit actuating other workers helped to make her the sympathetic and faithful translator she so abundantly proved herself to be .

		She had the true artist 's delight in her work , and her very recent maga - zine paper giving her reminiscences of the second funeral of
Napoleon	PERSON	shows her to have been far more than a hack writer or literary drudge .

		... The adventures of
Pedro Serrano	PERSON	, a Spanish castaway who may have given
Defoe	PERSON	the idea for his ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' might perhaps with some profit be brought out , by an enterprising modern pub - lisher , in a form suitable for young people 's reading .

		Garcilaso de la
Vega	PERSON	's '' Comentarios Reales '' give the story on the authority of a person who knew
Serrano	PERSON	and had often heard him relate his strange experiences .

		The island on which he was wrecked was but a patch of sandy reef in the
Caribbean Sea	LOCATION	,
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 and the seven years ' sufferings of Serrano give by comparison an air of ease and luxury to
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	's life on his wooded and fertile Juan Fer - nandez .

		This
Caribbean	LOCATION	episode dates back prob - ably to the early sixteenth century .

		An English translation of the '' Comentarios '' appeared in
1688	DATE	; and as
Defoe	PERSON	's `` Robinson Crusoe '' was not pub - lished till 1719 , he may well have read
Garcilaso	PERSON	's narrative before writing his own .

		These facts about
Serrano	PERSON	and his extraordinary history , as told by Mr.
John D. Leckie	PERSON	in '' Chambers 's Journal , '' sug - gest the possibility that Serrano rather than
Selkirk	ORGANIZATION	may have served as
Defoe	PERSON	's model in framing his immortal story .

		Or was it more probably a combi - nation of the two ?

		, , .

		The new editor of `` Uncle Remus 's Mag - azine '' is , appropriately enough , the late
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's son , Mr.
Julian Harris	PERSON	, who had been associated with his father in literary work , had secured the necessary financial backing for the magazine , had acted as its assistant editor , and had taken an active part in its business management .

		He is reputed an able writer , and indeed has col - laborated with his father in two books not yet pub - lished .

		From an announcement that appears in the
August	DATE	number of the magazine we learn that the late editor desired no monument , but chose to be remembered by a brief line informing the readers of his periodical that it was `` founded by
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	. ''

		To his son and successor his impressive injunction was : '' Keep the magazine clean , wholesome , and fresh with the best and simplest in life .

		Never let it become just a money - making machine . ''

		The promised continuance of the publication in the spirit of its founder is subject for congratulation .

		The rudimentary quality of illustration IN color , as at present produced , with such pride of achievement , in some of our leading monthly magazines , must have impressed itself on many readers of those magazines .

		Undoubtedly the time will come when the colored picture of our day will look as laughably crude and childish as does now to us the old woodcut of our grandparents ' spelling - book .

		A writer on book-illustration in the
July	DATE	'' Book Monthly '' informs his readers that `` the first English printed book to be illustrated was
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's ' Myrrour of the Worlde , ' printed in
1481	DATE	.

		The blocks were quite elementary in character , thus resembling indeed all the woodcuts of English books for a long time . ''

		And he adds , '' Is it not a far cry from those days to the present colour-book done in the three-colour process ? ''

		By no means ; there is , instead , a certain sort of similarity of crudeness in the two .

		, , , The NEWEST Shakespeare gospel is preached by Dr.
Peter Alvor	PERSON	, who , in a book just published at
Hanover	LOCATION	and entitled ''
Das Neue Shakespeare	PERSON	-
Evangelium	LOCATION	, '' endeavors to persuade the world that all the so-called Shakespeare tragedies were written by the
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	, and all the comedies by the
Earl	PERSON	of
Rutland	LOCATION	; but that , in order to escape political persecution , these noble authors induced a second-rate actor ,
William Shakespeare	PERSON	by name , to assume responsibility for the plays , and paid him well for this use of his name .


Rutland	LOCATION	's claims to the authorship not only of the comedies , but of all the plays , have already been defended by another German Shakespeare scholar , Professor
Karl Bleib	PERSON	- treu , who ridicules this notion of a divided author - ship . ''

		All for
Rutland	LOCATION	'' is his motto ; nothing for
Southampton	LOCATION	, nothing for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, nothing for
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	even , does he allow .

		• • • A NONAGENARIAN OPTIMIST , Professor
William Matthews	PERSON	, author of '' Getting on in the World '' -LRB- which is said to have sold to the extent of 70,000 copies in this country and to have been translated into Norwegian , Swedish , and Hungarian -RRB- , had his recent birthday brightened by the visits of admiring friends .

		At present he is confined as a patient in the
Emerson Hospital	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, having met with an accident that makes him temporarily unable to walk .

Norway	LOCATION	to
Alaska	LOCATION	in a Herring Boat .

		* To write well , one must first have something to say .

		Captain
Roald Amundsen	PERSON	, commander of the first successful Northwest-Passage expe - dition , has something of prime importance to relate , and his straightforward narrative makes not only one of the best books of Arctic explo - ration but one of the best books of adventure of any sort that have ever been written .

		Of course the existence of a continuous passage through the northern seas , from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, had been well enough known for half a century or more , thanks to the devoted labors of
Parry	LOCATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	, CoUinson ,
Rae	PERSON	, and other British explorers ; but no vessel had as yet succeeded in threading the difficult and dan - gerous route continuously from ocean to ocean .

		Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	's undertaking to accomplish this in a little herring boat of forty-seven tons was by many regarded as foolhardy , but it was plain that no vessel of deep draught or great breadth of beam could hope to navigate the shallows and pick its way through the floating ice of those far-northern waters .


Roald Amundsen	PERSON	, according to his much too brief account of his early youth and his boyhood ambitions , was a born explorer and Arctic voy - ager .

		Nothing could still within his breast the caU of the North-Polar seas , and he early began to fit himself for what he felt to be his life work .

		Seal-hunting in the far north was followed by an Antarctic voyage in the capacity of mate to the Belgian Antarctic Expedition xmder
Adrien de Gerlaehe	PERSON	, 1897-1899 . ''

		It was during this voyage , '' says the author , '' that my plan ma - tured : I proposed to combine the dream of my boyhood as to
North West Passage	LOCATION	with an aim , in itself of far greater scientific importance , that of locating the 2yresent situation of the
Magnetic North Pole	ORGANIZATION	^ On returning home the enthusiastic young explorer made his way to the
Meteorological Institute	ORGANIZATION	of his own country , and thence to
Hamburg	LOCATION	to submit his project to the greatest living authority on ter - restrial magnetism .

		as to furnish his visitor with instruction at the
Observatory	ORGANIZATION	in the details of magnetic obser - vations and the use of magnetic instruments .

		Advice and encouragement were also sought from the greatest living Scandinavian explorer , Dr.
Fridtjof Nansen	PERSON	; then foUowed some years of wearisome endeavor to raise funds for the proposed expedition , an endeavor too persistent to fail ; and at last , in the early
summer of 1903	DATE	, ship , crew , and cargo were all in readiness , and the adventurous party of seven sailed from
Christiania	LOCATION	.

		The long voyage lasted , if we may credit the title-page of '' The Northwest Passage , '' from
1903	DATE	to
1907	DATE	; but
Cape Nome	LOCATION	, which was practically the end of the all-important '' pas - sage , '' was reached in the late
summer of 1906	DATE	, nor does the narrative pursue further the for - tunes of either ship or crew , though one may infer that the ''
Gjoa	PERSON	's '' voyage was continued at least to
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		What thereafter became of the sturdy craft the reader would much like to know -- a curiosity that is not in the smallest degree gratified by the author .

		Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	does well not to preface his narrative with an exhaustive history of Northwest-Passage exploration before his time .

		The books are numerous enough on this subject , and we are just now eagerly interested in the '' Gjoa '' and the seven young Norwegians who man her , and who convey the impression of being rather a party of rollicking schoolboys escaped from their books than a serious band of dis - coverers , carrying their lives in their hands and intent on great ends .

		Such preliminary and interspersed accoimt as is given of what had already been effected by
Franklin	PERSON	and others in their search for the long-desired passage is too brief and hasty to be altogether trustworthy .

		That , however , need not destroy one 's confidence in the author 's record of his own and his com - panions ' achievements .

		What they did and saw and suffered is set down with the simplicity , restraint , and directness characteristic of the true hero 's account of his deeds .

		Difficult navi - gation , sledge excursions that were not exactly
summer	DATE	picnics , meteorological and magnetic observations under trying conditions , the exac - tion of some degree of respect and decorum from the swarming Esquimaux that beset them in their winter quarters , and the continual problem of food , fuel , and shelter in the cruel cold of those latitudes -- that , in brief , indicates the work that was cut out for Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	and his little crew .

		No doctor accompanied the expedi - tion , and , although the commander essayed the

		THE DIAL 81 part of physician when occasion demanded , one life was lost before the voyage was completed ; and one life out of seven was more than a deci - mation of the entire force .

		Two men , however , -- one a Norwegian , the other an American -- were found to repair as far as possible the sad loss .

		Among many perils more or less exciting , even in the author 's quiet narration , one especially deserves mention .

		The vessel had grounded in the shallows of
Franklin Strait	LOCATION	, the north wind blew a gale accompanied by sleet , and the spray was dashing over deck and rigging .

		After consulting with his comrades the captain decided to try to get the ship off with the sails .

		With much exertion they were set .

		The nar - rator continues : '' Then we commenced a method of sailing not one of us is ever likely to forget even should he attain the age of Methuseleh .

		The mighty press of sail and the high choppy sea , combined , had the effect of lifting the ves - sel up and pitching her forward again among the rocks , so that we expected every moment to see her planks scat - tered on the sea .

		The false keel was splintered and floated up .

		All we could do was to watch the course of events and calmly await the issue .

		As a matter of fact , I can not say I did feel calm as I stood in the rigging and followed the dance from one rock to another .

		I stood there with the bitterest self-reproach .

		If I had set a watch in the crow 's nest , this would never have happened , because he would have observed the reef a long way off and reported it .

		Was my carelessness to wreck our whole undertaking , which had begun so auspi - ciously ?

		Should we , who had got so much further than anyone before us -- we who had so fortunately cleared parts of the passage universally regarded as the most difficult -- should we now be compelled to stop and turn back crestfallen ? ''

		By throwing overboard the deck cargo and thus enabling the ship to rise a little higher under wind and wave , she finally and with many ter - rific bumps got off the reef and into compara - tively navigable waters .

		Another and an earlier narrow escape from destruction is worth noting , A furious fire one day broke out in the engine-room , right among the tanks holding two thousand gallons of petro - leum , and was only extinguished after the most daring and energetic exertions from all hands .

		The Fates on the whole were kind to these bold adventurers , but few readers will be tempted to try a yachting cruise along the northern coast of our continent , rich in incident though such a voyage might be .

		The pages devoted to the Esquimaux and their ways are fresh and interesting .

		Unversed in the native dialects , these Norwegians yet con - trived to talk , with some degree of volubility , with the round-faced men of the icy North ; and the intimate studies made of a few more strik - ing or more intelligent individuals among them are , in a human way , worth all the geographical and scientific information in the entire two vol - umes .

		Here is a picture of Talurnaktu , a
Nechilli Esquimau	PERSON	, who was taken into the camp on
King William	LOCATION	Land : '' His toilet was grand .

		Next to his skin he wore a blue woollen guernsey , over this a himting shirt , and outside an under-coat -LRB- anorak -RRB- .

		His imderstandings were clothed in a pair of moleskin trousers .

		All these were worn-out old clothes discarded by
Lindstrom	PERSON	. '

		I shall darn them during the winter , ' he said ; but mean - time he left the rags as they were .

		On his head he had an old cycling cap , to which he had attached a dirty collar by way of ornament .

		Take him all round he was really a regular * ` Arry , ' and always cheerful .

		He smoked and chewed tobacco , and he did all he could to conduct himself like a white man .

		He took great pride in about six hairs , half an inch long , growing on his upper lip .

		He spoke with the utmost scorn of men who had no moustache .

		He was as strong as a bear , and , as he was so willing , he was a splendid fellow to have as help . ''

		Sad but not surprising is the white man 's influence on these natives of the hyperborean ice-fields as noted by the author . ''

		During the voyage of the '
Gjoa	PERSON	' we came into con - tact with ten different Eskimo tribes in all , and we had good opportunities of observing the influence of civihsa - tion on them , as we were able to compare those Eskimo who had come into contact with civilisation with those who had not .

		And I must state it as my firm convic - tion that the latter , the Eskimo living absolutely isolated from civilisation of any kind , are undoubtedly the hap - piest , healthiest , most honorable and most contented among them .

		It must , therefore , be the bounden duty of civilised nations who come into contact with the
Eskimo	LOCATION	, to safeguard them against contaminating influ - ences , and by laws and stringent regulations protect them against the many perils and evils of so-called civ - ilisation . ''

		A supplementary chapter narrates inter - estingly the events of Lieutenant
Hansen	PERSON	's surveying expedition to the east coast of

		Coast . ''

		This account is from the lieu - tenant 's pen .

		The scientific observations con - ducted by Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	and his assistants , with various instriunents brought for the pur - pose , must be counted the most valuable fruits of the voyage ; but , although the subject is not entered upon in detail , it appears that several years must elapse before the necessary calcula - tions are completed to render these observations of actual service to mankind .

		The determina - tion of the magnetic north pole is no holiday pastime .

		As to the
Northwest Passage	ORGANIZATION	itself , it is obviously of no commercial or other use now that it is found ; and in fact the only really fresh achievement to be credited to the '' Gjoa '' is the accomplishment of the hitherto short unnavigated section of the passage in the neigh -
82	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, borhood of
Cape Colborne	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nevertheless , the very fact that there was no business profit in this arduous undertaking makes us admire the high-spirited explorers who risked their lives and endured a three-years ' banishment from the civilized world for the sake of an idea .

		The narrative is not free from bewildering inconsistencies , which sometimes amount to positive inaccuracies .

		For instance , an early chapter has one passage that makes the '' Gjoa '' sail through
Bellot Strait	PERSON	, between North Som - erset and
Boothia Felix	PERSON	, while the context , as well as the indicated route on the map , shows plainly that the vessel passed through
Barrow Strait	LOCATION	, north of
North Somerset	LOCATION	, and down through
Franklin Strait	PERSON	to
King William Land	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations are abundant and , being chiefly from photographs , trustworthy and helpful .

		The maps are also useful , but are not drawn on a scale large enough to display every movement of vessel and sledge .

		The English translator 's name is withheld , though he has no reason to be ashamed of his work , so far as one can see .

		It is worth noting as a sign of the book 's appar - ent popularity that there are published simul - taneously versions in Swedish , Finnish , Russian , German , and Italian , besides the original Nor - wegian edition .

		Old Essays and a : n ^ ew Play by ``
Vernon Leb	PERSON	. ''

		* The talented woman whose name in real life is
Violet Paget	LOCATION	, although she writes over the more prosaic and non-committal signature of ``
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, '' has given us a new edition of '' Limbo , aud Other Essays , '' with the addition of a drama entitled '' Ariadne in
Mantua	LOCATION	. ''

		The author 's first book appeared when she was only twenty-four years old , a rather youthful age to publish such a work as '' Studies in the Eight - eenth Century in
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		During the three sub - sequent decades she has been writing attractive essays , stories , dialogues , and so forth , and has gradually won well-deserved recognition .

		She is master of an easy , at times almost conversa - tional style , that makes the reader feel he is being treated en intime ; and it is naturally delightful to enter into such relations with an unusually clever woman .

		But ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	'' is decidedly more than clever -- she is clairvoyant and sympathetic .

		Her eyes have looked into life and have bidden her judgment be merciful .

		• Limbo , and Other Essays .

		With a new drama , '' Ariadne in
Mantua	LOCATION	. ''

		By
Vernon Lee	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In literature her studies have been comprehen - sive and thorough , although the results thereof are never obtruded pedantically .

		While an intimate topographical knowledge of most of
Western Europe	LOCATION	is implied by her writings , her years have been spent largely in
Italy	LOCATION	, which she knows as few descendants of the Goths and Vandals have ever known the winsome land beyond the Alps .

		For her ,
Italy	LOCATION	is the nearest point of approach to the land east of the sun and west of the moon ; and with this feeling the reviewer assuredly can not quarrel as he faces a flood of memories .

		Perhaps , too , there is a lit - tle of the personal equation in the feeling that our author is most attractive when dealing with Italian themes ; but there can be no doubt that , in general , her most successful essays are of the '' travel-and-place '' type .

		In the present vol - ume , for instance , ''
Ravenna	LOCATION	and her Ghosts '' is incomparably better than the eponymous chapter .

		Indeed , '' Limbo '' is so far from de - serving the place of honor that it is decidedly the least attractive section of the book .

		On the whole it may be said that ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	'' can hardly appeal to readers who have not had a little of her good fortune in the way of leisure and travel , or have not at least caught sight of the spirit of leisure in the flux of things and learned to send the spirit journeying whither the body can not fare .

		Within this circle , how - ever , she will be keenly enjoyed . ''

		Ariadne in
Mantua	LOCATION	'' seems to us an ex - ceptionally charming closet drama .

		The action takes place in the palace of
Mantua	LOCATION	during the reign of
Prospero I. of Milan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The young duke is under the spell of a benumbing melan - cholia .

		One Diego , a famous singer , has been summoned from
Venice	LOCATION	to gain access to his
Highness	ORGANIZATION	's confidence and to aid in relieving the strange obsession .

		It soon transpires that
Diego	PERSON	is the courtesan
Magdalen	PERSON	, who had been the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's genuinely beloved mistress when he was serving abroad .

		The invalid is restored to health without discovering the identity of his lost love and the healing singer .

		In the last act he marries his cousin ; and at the festival Diego presents a masque treating of Ariadne 's desertion by Theseus and her refusal to be com - forted by Bacchus .

		The ending must be left for those of our readers who care to peruse the play .

		Throughout the drama the characters are well limned .

		But perhaps the most remark - able is the Duchess Dowager ; for here a woman writer has convincingly depicted a virtuous woman of noble birth as being infinitely mer - ciful and tender to an erring sister who sprang

		THE DIAL 83 from the gutter .

		The language is consistent with the respective personce , and worthy of the theme , occasionally rising to a lofty level .

		The parallel between the myth and the events in the play is never allowed to become too prominent ; nor do the players ever lose their human interest from being representatives of a problem .

		The playwright frankly avows her feeling that '' these personages had an importance greater than that of their life and adventures , a meaning , if I may say so , a little sub specie ceternitatis .

		For besides the real figures , there appeared to me vague shadows cast by them , as it were , on the vast spaces of life , and magnified far beyond those little puppets that I twitched . ''

		This modestly voiced hope seems to us thoroughly justified , and we are glad to recommend the play to any reader who is willing to ponder a little on the relation between '' mere impulse , unreasoning and violent , but absolutely true to its aim , '' and '' the moderating , the weighing , and restraining influences of civilization . ''

		Tradi - tion , Discipline , Discretion , -- in the presence of these necessary and victorious factors of progress what shall become of untutored love and the eternal cry of the human heart ?

		* The story of the great Mystics makes an interesting and remarkable chapter in the prog - ress and development of mankind .

		Side by side with the religions and philosophies that have been the profound and influential teachers of the race has moved the procession of specially illu - mined men and women who have emphasized the deepening message of the ages from a stand - point and comprehension more or less individual , and furnishing a witness of the unfolding truth cogent and alluring .

		The Mystics have labored diligently within the field of the established faiths , but often with distinct antagonisms to popular ruling doctrines and institutions .

		In - deed , they have usually occupied the place of reformers and liberators ; they have made vehe - ment attacks upon privilege and prerogative , the sources of manifold and tyrannizing evils ; they have been voices in the wilderness , crying out against manifest and powerful wrong ; they have brought healing and regeneration from direct contact with essential life and thought .

		The Mystics have appeared in all nations and times .

		The mind of
Japan	LOCATION	was singularly sus - ceptible to the revelations which make the sub - stance of the Mystic 's report and narrative ; even in prosaic and moralistic
China	LOCATION	there were reactions against the prevalent Confucianism that lifted the veil from before the sanctuary ; in
India	LOCATION	the Gita-Govitida rivals the Song of Songs in its impassioned disclosures of relations that are to be found discussed at length in Mystic literature everywhere ; and the
Bhagavat	LOCATION	-
Gita	PERSON	presents a dialogue which has found its echoes again and again in books .


Persia	LOCATION	was a luxu - riant soil for the growth of poems that indicate and illustrate experiences not belonging to the ordinary light of the common day ; even the skeptical Omar has in some interpretations been made the bearer of a transcendent intelligence .

		The Song of Solomon aroused the middle-age thinkers to a long line of kindred and supra - mundane revelations .

		Plato ,
Philo	PERSON	, Plotinus deal with realms to which the thought of man is not unaccustomed , but which require an un - wearied wing and an unusual exercise of energy .

		The Mystic , however , found a most congenial home and a responsive audience during the Middle Ages .

		The ardent subjectivity of man - kind awoke to a wonderful consciousness of it - self , and began to discover regions hardly known before .

		Bonaventura ,
Bernard	PERSON	of
Clairvaux	LOCATION	,
Nicholas	PERSON	of
Cusa	LOCATION	,
Saint Catherine	PERSON	of
Siena	LOCATION	, -- these belong to a cloud of witnesses who have an extraordinary message to deliver , and who pre - sent it with singular nobility and marked unan - imity .

		The Mystic tradition has come down to modern times in
France	LOCATION	, in
England	LOCATION	, in
America	LOCATION	; the transcendentalist has had his tale to tell , and has told it with inspiration and charm .

		It may be an easy exercise of the skeptical understanding to sweep all this long and con - tinuous history into the limbo of the abnormal and the hysterical ; it may certainly be said that there are sane and reasoned philosophies whose content differs in no wise from that of the genuine mystical literatures .

		With the com - plete discrediting of the mystical , we shall also be obliged to discredit these .

		It may be that
Plato	PERSON	and
Hegel	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	have dwelt in a vague and hazy dreamland , and that modern culture and life can have in them , after all , only an historical interest ; but with the disappear - ance of these from a real part in the experiences of to-day , shall we also get rid of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and sundry other poets and men of letters ?

		The question can only be raised here , without any attempt at discussion .

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
Catherine	PERSON	of
Siena	LOCATION	, mystic as she was , had her doubts ; but she found a way of meeting them .

		We quote from her : '' I will teach thee -LSB- said the
Voice	ORGANIZATION	in her heart -RSB- how to distinguish My visions from the visions of the enemy .

		My vision begins with terror , but always , as it grows , gives greater confidence ; it begins with some bitterness , but always groweth more sweet .

		In the vision of the enemy , the contrary happens ; for in the beginning it seems to bring some gladness , confidence , or sweetness , but , as it proceeds , fear and bitterness grow continuously in the soul of whoso beholds it ... But I will give thee another sign more infallible and more certain .

		Be assured that , since I am Truth , there ever results from My visions a greater knowledge of truth in the soul ; and , because the knowledge of truth is most necessary to her about Me and about herself , that is , that she should know Me and know herself , from which knowl - edge it ever follows that she despises herself and honors Me , which is the proper office of himaility , it is inevi - table that from My visions the soul becomes more humble , knowing herself , and knowing Me better . ''

		This is , of course , the medisBval method of stating the fact ; but even at the present time the easy and pleasurable way of the physiological analysis , with its complicated experimental sta - tions , is not an imquestionable one of reaching the truth .

		Moreover , the speculative results of the visionaries have often found fruitful demon - strations in the realms of history and reality .

		The Mystics have been of all grades and varieties -- illiterate and cultured , peasant and nobleman , pauper and prince ; they have occu - pied every station in life and performed every sort of labor ; they have ploughed the seas and discovered new continents like
Columbus	LOCATION	; they have disposed of refractory Parliaments like
Cromwell	PERSON	; they have crowned monarchs against seemingly overwhelming odds like
Jeanne	PERSON	d' Arc ; they have transformed a whole world like
Martin Luther	ORGANIZATION	.

		They have bled on the field of battle , they have been burned in the fires of martjrr - dom , they have died on the cross , for the
Truth	ORGANIZATION	's sake .

		They can , however , be properly divided into three classes -- the Quietists , whose lives are given to contemplation ; the Voluntarists , who rush into the mad whirl of the world and pluck victory from the jaws of the impossible : and the Intellectualists , who give an account of themselves and develop a psychology of the Mystic consciousness .

		It seems likely that they will continue to appear in the future as they have done in the past .

		The subject of the exhaustive and captivating study immediately before us ,
Saint Catherine	PERSON	of
Siena	LOCATION	, was the comparatively uneducated daughter of
Jacomo	PERSON	and
Lapa di Benincasa	PERSON	, simple and earnest people who did all in their power for the large family with which they were blessed .

		She was born on the 25th of
March , 1347	DATE	, the feast of the
Annunciation	LOCATION	, which according to Sienese reckoning was the first day of the new year .

		Saint
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	had died a hundred and twenty years before , and
Dante	PERSON	had passed from exile a quarter of a cen - tury earlier .

		Petrarch was then forty-three years old ;
Boccaccio	PERSON	had not yet written the De - cameron ; Chaucer was probably a boy of seven ;
Charles King of Bohemia	LOCATION	had been elected Emperor ; and
Pope Clement VI	PERSON	.

		ruled at
Avignon	LOCATION	.


Italy	LOCATION	was still the '' hostelry of sorrow '' and not yet the '' lady of provinces . ''

		The cities were in the hands of remorseless tyrants , or , if they pretended to govern them - selves , were subject to internal conflicts and hostile attacks from their neighbors .

		Hordes of mercenary soldiers held allegiance now under this one and now under that , and gave misrule additional horrors .

		The moral condition of ruler and citizen was no better than the politi - cal ; pestilence and disease came with resistless strength and malignity .

		Catherine of
Siena	LOCATION	was to pass into this scene and this atmosphere with words of admonition and hands of healing .

		Her power was shown early ; visions floated before her , and her voca - tion was soon determined .

		She met with the usual opposition from home and friends , but she went forth undeterred to the fulfilment of her work .

		She joined the
Sisters of Penance of St. Dominic	ORGANIZATION	, called in
Siena	LOCATION	the Mantellate , -- not nuns , strictly speaking , but devoted to the service of religion while remaining in their homes .

		Her life became painfuUy rigid and austere ; her soid was evidently set apart for special labors and duties .

		Gradually a body of faithful disciples and adherents gathered about her , members of the Mantellate , women of culture and noble birth ; then priests , who recognized her right of leader - ship , and later men and women from every walk in life .

		Chief among her followers were the
Fra Raimondo du Capua	LOCATION	, later Master of the Dominicans , who wrote her story , the authentic source of information about her , and
Stefano Maconi	PERSON	, the Carthusian , a man of the same mould as herself .

		The fellowship found ample toil waiting for it .

		Catherine was a leader and commander , -- '' A wonderfully endowed woman with an intuition so swift and infallible that men deemed it miraculous , the magic of a personality so winning and irresistible that neither man nor woman could hold out against it , a simple untaught wisdom that confounded the arts and subtleties of the world ; and with these a speech so golden , so full of mystical eloquence , that her words .

		THE DIAL .

		85 whether written or spoken , made all hearts burn within them when her message came .

		In ecstatic contempla - tion she passes into regions beyond sense and above reason , voyaging alone in tmexplored and untrodden realms of the spirit ; but when the sounds of the earth break in upon her trance , a homely common sense and simple humor are hers , no less than the knowledge acquired in these communings with an unseen world . ''

		Catherine soon entered upon her great tasks .

		The fellowship at different times occupied differ - ent abodes ; they grew into a significant power in
Siena	LOCATION	.


Catherine	PERSON	was a preacher of win - ning charm and singular allurement ; she per - suaded many into an abandonment of lives that brought forth unwholesome fruits .

		Siena was torn by feuds and hostile factions , and
Catherine	PERSON	was recognized as a mediator in their internecine quarrels .

		Nor was
Siena	LOCATION	alone aware that a new spiritual force had arisen in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		She was to play a part in the settlement of political dis - turbances in
Milan	LOCATION	and
Pisa	LOCATION	and
Lucca	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	.

		She now began the series of letters which continued during the remainder of her days .

		They contain her hopes and dreams , they exhort priests and potentates to bring about that reformation of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	which will give peace and unity to
Italy	LOCATION	; they voice again the aspirations which make up the political creed of her predecessor
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, and which burst forth with renewed vigor in the im - passioned demands of her successor
Savonarola	LOCATION	.

		Into the details of this struggle , and this mingled defeat and victory , we can not enter here .

		She threw herself with unrestrained ardor into three large projects -- a mistaken zeal for another crusade , urged by the Pope ; the reforma - tion and regeneration of the prelacy ; the return of the Pope to
Rome	LOCATION	from his exile in
Avignon	LOCATION	.

		This last had already been fiercely brought to the attention of
Gregory XI.	PERSON	, by the Swedish Mystic and Prophetess ,
Birgitta	PERSON	, then residing in
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Unless the Pope , '' was the message of
Birgitta	PERSON	, '' comes to
Italy	LOCATION	in the time and in the year appointed , the lands of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, which are now united under his sway and obedience , will be flivided in the hands of his enemies . ''

		The difficulties of the time had brought on the bitter war between
Florence	LOCATION	and the Pope ; the cities vacillated between the two ;
Bernabo Visconti	PERSON	, the sinister tyrant of
Milan	LOCATION	, gave gloomy counsel and fomented discord ;
Giovanna	PERSON	, the pleasure-loving and mysterious Queen of
Naples	LOCATION	, intervened and increased the bitterness of the conflict ;
Catherine	PERSON	with her fellowship was called to
Florence	LOCATION	, and from there sent to
Avignon	LOCATION	.

		This was the crowning labor of her life .

		The Florentines behaved with wily and astute treachery ; the counsellors about the Pope built up every sort of obstacle , palpable and tenuous , between her and the Holy Father ; she maintained her spiritual supremacy , held him firm to the purpose , and after incredible tribula - tions , natural and apparently supernatural , re - stored the Pope to the Imperial city .

		Her great work was done .

		In the year following , and at the coming of the schism , when several Popes claimed the legitimacy of their election ,
Catherine	PERSON	espoused the cause of Urban VI .

		She came to
Rome	LOCATION	at his invitation , and there , after enduring prolonged and violent suffering , induced perhaps by the austerity of her life , she made the great transition , surrounded by her unfaltering friends , on
April 29 , 1380	DATE	.

		Toward the close of her life ,
Catherine	PERSON	took thought for the written word she was leaving behind her .

		In the
early autumn of 1378	DATE	she completed her remarkable book , the Dialogo or Libro della
Divina Dottrina	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is a series of Dialogues , in which the mystical doctrines of the Saint are unfolded at length , and in which the views presented in
Catherine	LOCATION	's letters are more fuUy expounded .

		The letters number nearly four hundred .

		These are writ - ten to kings and mendicants , saints and sinners , priests and popes .

		They are done with authority as of one who had the right to speak and give counsel and admonition .

		When the names of the patriotic lovers of
Italy	LOCATION	are spoken , no one should forget the name of
Catherine	PERSON	of
Siena	LOCATION	.

		For the work of Mr.
Edmund G. Gardner	PERSON	, exhaustive and scholarly , one can only have that admiration which mastery of a subject in - evitably invites and receives .

		Mr.
Gardner	PERSON	knows
Italy	LOCATION	, its life , its history , its religion , its ideals , as few men know any country , even their own .

		It is superfluous to say that the original sources of information have been at the author 's command , and the libraries of
Italy	LOCATION	have been laid under contribution .

		The subject is treated at length , and with perhaps extreme detail ; but the picture of the fourteenth century in
Italy	LOCATION	is significant and convincing .

		The author is in f iill sympathy with the noble woman who makes the centre of his portrayal , and not blind to the difficulties which surround so arcane a subject .

		There is sometimes to be found the scholar 's besetting sin , a too impressive display of erudi - tion , and a too close adherence to authorities , with a consequent lack of finish ; but happily , since
Pater	PERSON	wrote , the critic 's office has been merged in that of the interpreter 's .

		The work is a superb one , worthy of the fine setting which the publishers have given it , -- in illustrations 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, and binding and printing a book which delights the eye as its contents delight the mind .

		The orderly arrangement of the work is particularly noteworthy ; notwithstanding the wealth of detail , clearness is never sacrificed , and the picture becomes more effective with every added stroke ; indeed , as in every history worthy of the name , the interest accumulates with the progress of the narrative .

		The book must take its place with the important ones on its subject .

		It contains also a well-selected Bibliography and a copious Index .

		doctrine '' that spreads abroad from

Maitland	PERSON	's conclusion : '' It is of course too soon to guess what

		Let us hope he will do so , and eventually pro- duce some work which does not require an eluci - datory progi-amme to render it intelligible .

		The article on '' Symphony Concerts '' is interesting from its local point of view , as it con - tains the history of eight American symphony orchestras ,
viz.	LOCATION	, the
Boston Symphony	ORGANIZATION	,
Brooklyn Philharmonic	LOCATION	,
Theodore Thomas Orchestra	PERSON	, Cin - cinnati Symphony -LRB- recently disbanded -RRB- .

		Phil - harmonic Society of

		The historical facts in the life of our own
Chicago	LOCATION	orchestra are correctly given except in one regard .

		The writer , a
New York	LOCATION	musical critic , says that at the end of the first period of the contract the guarantors were dis - couraged by the losses entailed by the concerts and by '' certain unpleasant experiences in which Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	had become involved as Musical Director of the World 's Fair in
1893	DATE	. ''

		It woidd have been historically correct to say that they were '' disappointed , '' not '' discouraged , '' by the losses , and that Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's World 's Fair experiences had no more to do with the orchestra 's affairs or the guarantors ' feelings than the rising of the sun .

		But
New York	LOCATION	will never be exactly just to
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Its angle of western vision has always been distorted .

		Upon the whole , this volume is a worthy companion to its three predecessors , notwith - standing some faults of omission .

		But why should such a dignified and important musical work of reference be disfigured with such a hodge-podge of mediocre and poorly-executed illustrations in these days of pictorial excellence ?

		There is no excuse for it .

Consulate	ORGANIZATION	.

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 87 vernacular .

		It is well that their value should be emphasized by the fact of translation .

		The frequency with which one meets quotations from them in the better books on the period shows the estimate which scholars long ago placed upon them .

		They certainly rank with the Memoirs of
Miot	PERSON	or
Mollien	PERSON	, and the Recollections of Chaptal .

		Thibaudeau 's wide political experience , as well as his confidential relations with
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Josephine	PERSON	, enhance the value of his obser - vations .

		He had first come up to
Paris	LOCATION	with his father , who had been chosen a member of the States General .

		He was himself a member of the Convention and of the
Council of Five Hundred	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the Convention he acted with the Mountain party , though in no slavish spirit , for he refused to join the
Paris Jacobin	ORGANIZATION	club on the ground that this might interfere with the inde - pendence of his decisions as a legislator .

		When the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	was organized , he was appointed a member of the
Council of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		If the conversations of the Councillor are , as we have every reason to suppose , the conversations of
Thibaudeau	LOCATION	, he enjoyed the confidence of Gen - eral
Bonaparte	PERSON	to such a degree that he could frankly express his disapproval of the transfor - mation of the Consular government in
1802	DATE	.

		Bonaparte merely remarked that it was time he got rid of his dreams .

		Josephine also trusted him , for she told him of the difficulties and anxieties growing out of the intrigues of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's brothers , who were urging the establish - ment of an hereditary regime in order that their own position might be magnified .

		The memoirs were written in
1827	DATE	, when
Thibaudeau	PERSON	, as one of the regicides who had adhered to the government of the Hundred Days , was an exile in
Brussels	LOCATION	.

		He had already pub - lished two volumes of his autobiography , touch - ing the periods of the Convention and the Directory .

		They seem to have excited the anger of the Bourbon authorities , and , through diplo - matic intervention , he barely escaped expulsion from the
Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		This accounts for the fact that in the new volume he abandons the autobiographical form and presents anonymous recollections , leaving himself quite in the back - ground .

		The lapse of time between the Con - sulate and the later years of the Restoration would ordinarily impair our confidence in the accuracy of
Thibaudeau	ORGANIZATION	's testimony .

		There is more than one indication , however , that his state - ments do not rest upon memory alone , but upon notes carefully made at the time .

		There is a passage in the chapter on '' Discussions on the Civil Code '' which gives an important indication in this matter .

		Thibaudeau is criticizing
Locre	ORGANIZATION	's official report of the discussions in the
Council	ORGANIZATION	, because Locre had '' reduced all the speeches to a cold , measured , uniform style ... which , far from having flattered the First Consul by making him speak like the rest ... detract immensely from the freedom , vigour , and origi - nality of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	's own words . ''

		In order to support his criticism ,
Thibaudeau	PERSON	placed in parallel columns the official version of Bona - parte 's words '' and his actual words as they were carefully taken down by another hand . ' '

		Dr.
Fortescue	PERSON	suggests that this other hand was Thi - baudeau 's , and that he had either an unusual verbal memory or a system of short-hand .

		At all events , he ascribes to him special skill in reporting debates and conversations , not only for this period but also for the periods that preceded .

		He does not throw much light on the reasons for his confidence , save that he believes that a com - parison of
Thibaudeau	ORGANIZATION	's reports with others will carry conviction of the superiority of his ver - sions .

		From the point of view of the historical method , this leaves something to be desired .

		These memoirs cover nearly every phase of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	, the organization of the administra - tion , the principal problems of the government , and even the manceuvres by which the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	ceased to be a republican and became a monarchi - cal government .

		Perhaps the most important chapter is the one already mentioned , the '' Dis - cussions on the Civil Code . ''

		These discussions illustrate
Bonaparte	PERSON	's share in the making of the code .

		The tone of his remarks must always be a surprise to one familiar mainly with the
Napoleon	PERSON	of diplomacy and war .

		They are not a series of judgments , given with an air of finality , but the opinions expressed wear the garb of reasonableness .

		Certain of his remarks , recorded in a subsequent chapter where the question of taxation is raised , are still more sur - prising .

		He is made to say : '' There is neither liberty nor property in a country in which the amount of taxation to be levied from each individual varies from year to year ... Why is public spirit so wanting in
France	LOCATION	?

		because every proprietor is obliged to pay his court to the powers that be .

		If he falls into bad odour he may find himself a ruined man ... In no other country are the people so servile to the Government as in
France	LOCATION	, because here all property is dependent on its good will ... Nothing has been done in
France	LOCATION	on behalf of property .

		The man who would devise a good law on the cadastre would deservea statue . ''

		There is much information of the lighter sort also in the memoirs .

		Especially interesting is the gi-adual evolution of a court etiquette , the stages of which
Thibaudeau	ORGANIZATION	seems to have 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, indicated with the minute particularity of a con - vinced but somewhat disillusioned republican .

		The reader is amused at the experimental changes in official costume , and at the tribula - tions of the persons who were obliged to use in state processions public cabs , simply covering the numbers with paper .

		Among the minor though not unimportant features of this record are
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's conversations with
Josephine	PERSON	, who ,
Thibaudeau	PERSON	says , though most of a lady of all at the new court , detested the theatrical effects which were sought , and sighed for greater privacy and freedom from false constraint .

		Dr.
Fortescue	PERSON	has done his work as editor well , though the volume has an unnecessary number of misprints or slight errors .

		It is to be hoped that he will carry out the intention he announces of presenting a translation of
Thibaudeau	PERSON	's '' Memoires sur la Convention et le Directoire . ''

		These woidd not have the advantage of
Napoleon	PERSON	's magical name , an important consideration from the publisher 's point of view , but they make up one of the most informing descriptions of the later periods of the Revolution .

		soul '' to self-expression .

		But one night when he has been seated at the piano he is startled by hear - ing a sob just outside his window .

		Rushing out , he contrives to capture the agitated girl who has been listening to his music ; and in this manner we make the acquaintance of one of the most winsome and altogether adorable of the heroines of recent fiction .

		Her name is
Pamela	LOCATION	, but everyone calls her
Pam	PERSON	, and her daily task is to carry the post .

		Thus the story which concerns her gets its name , '' The Post Girl . ''

		As the story goes on , the
Spawer	PERSON	's thoughts become in ever-increasing measure detached from his profes - sional work , and in corresponding measure attached to his new acquaintance .

		Not to labor the point over - much , he falls in love with her , and she is generously responsive , albeit her bearing is only such as befits the purest and most instinctively refined of maidens .

		But it so happens that the hero 's troth is already plightedelse where , and he has a conscience .

		He resolves to leave
Pam	PERSON	, although it will be like pluck - ing out his heart-strings , and the separation is about to be effected when an opportune letter -LRB- whereby hangs still another tale which we have not space to include -RRB- sets him free .

		Then there is a stirring scene of mutual rescue from the rocks and waves , then there is the discovery of
Pam	PERSON	's gentle bu ` th and worldly expectations , and then there is the close of of it all , with unlimited happiness in prospect .

		The scenario of Mr.
Booth	PERSON	's story is thus of the simplest , but he has invested his situations and his character - izations with a charm so great that his every chapter maintains the reader in a condition of alternate sus - pense and satisfaction , both of which are delightful .

		Two other characters are portrayed for us with extra - ordinary vividness -- those of the loquacious parson and of the sullen schoolmaster who also loves
Pam	PERSON	and almost forces her to his wUl .

		Besides telling a fascinating story , the author puts a good deal of him - self into the book , and his many reflective and de - scriptive pages give us a happy blend of shrewd wisdom and sly humor , to say nothing of their verbal beauty .

		He has a manner almost Meredithian in its richness , but without the Meredithian asperity .

		He has given us what is probably the best novel of the
summer	DATE	, because it is the most human and the most appealing .

		Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	has found a fetching title for his latest novel , but '' Delilah of the Snows '' is something of a misnomer , for it apphes only to a rather unimportant episode of the book .

		The story is little more than a replica of the author 's previous productions , telling us again of the struggle for fortune and love of the English settler in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		This time the hero is a gold miner , and the scene of his activity is among the mountains of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The narrative is vigorous and straightfor - ward , without nicety of style , but wholesome in tone , and moderately interesting .

		Although his work no longer has the freshness of interest it possessed when we first made its acquaintance , Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	may still be counted upon to tell a readable story .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 Among our audacious latter-day sophists , who so neatly make the worse appear the better reason , Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is gaining a high place .

		Indeed , he may almost dispute the honors of leadership with the priest-in-chief of the cult of paradox , Mr.
G. Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.

		His latest '' budget of paradoxes '' takes the form of a novel -- or , rather , of a fantastic invention , which has to be described as fiction because it bears no conceivable relation to reality .

		Even the author balks at his own imaginings , and passes off the whole invention as a dream when he comes to the last chap - ter .

		It is called '' The Man Who Was
Thursday	DATE	, '' and has to do with the conflict between anarchy and order .

		A central council of anarchists , seven in number , bear the names of the days of the week -LRB- which accounts for our title -RRB- , and , under the lead - ership of an awe-inspiring
Sunday	DATE	, develop their programme of treasons , stratagems , and spoils .

		The gigantic humor of the conception is that these seven men are really
Scotland	LOCATION	Yard detectives , spying upon each other ; for each of them thinks that all the others are genuine anarchists .

		The amount of fun that Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	gets out of this situation may readily be imagined , as well as the opportunity it affords him for the exercise of his talent for paradox .

		Like most dreams , the story grows more wildly impossible as the awakening is neared .

		It is a highly entertaining yarn , and exhibits the author in the light in which he ought always to be viewed -- the light of a man not for a moment to be taken seriously upon any subj.ect , but simply to be ad - mired for a combination of nimble wit with diabolical cleverness .

		`` This is a terribly sensational book , '' writes Father Benson in introducing his '' Lord of the World '' to his readers .

		Since his story leads up to , and ends with , the day of judgment , the preliminary warning would appear to be justified .

		`` Then this world passed , and the glory of it , '' is the closing sentence of a book as daring in conception as Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's `` Masque of Judgment . ''

		The period of the story is some centuries ahead of the present time .

		Air-ships and other mechanical inventions are com - monplaces , and the problem which confronts man - kind is the impending conflict between East and
West	LOCATION	.

		This menace is finally removed through the efforts of a mysterious personage named
Felsen	PERSON	- burgh , an American who has the gift of tongues and an irresistibly persuasive individuality .

		He is haUed as the deliverer of mankind , and the g ^ eat powers of the world unite in making him their supreme arbiter .

		But his triumph is the triumph of a godless materialism , and will not be complete until the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the last bulwark of effete super - stition , is wiped out of existence .

		Consequently , the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is attacked in its central citadel ;
Rome	LOCATION	is annihilated by a fleet of dynamiting airships , and the entire hierarchy is believed to be destroyed .

		The triumph of Antichrist -LRB- as incarnated in
Felsen	LOCATION	- burgh -RRB- seems to be definitive , but a remnant of the upholders of the faith has been miraculously spared , and has found refuge in
Palestine	LOCATION	.

		There it renews its organization in a manner suggestive of the times of primitive Christianity , and there it awaits the last onslaught of the powers of evil .

		The last day dawns upon the field of Armageddon , and the portentous approach of doom is impressively pictured .

		But the author 's imagination balks at the final cataclysm , and puts it all into the simple sentence quoted above .

		A sort of repressed intensity , the product of spiritual fanaticism , is the distinguishing mark of this extraor - dinary invention .

		Matters of private and sentimental interest are woven into the narrative just described , but only in a perfunctory way ; in the case of '' The Vigil , '' by Mr.
Harold Begbie	PERSON	, the element of human interest is much more considerable , and yet religious discus - sion occupies so large a part of the book as to make extensive tracts of it unreadable .

		The discussion , moreover , does not involve the momentous issues that appeal to the imagination in Father
Benson	PERSON	's story , but deals with such futilities as the celibacy of the English clergy and the merits of rival methods of inculcating Christian doctrine .

		Fortunately , these arid passages are to a certain extent segregated , and the author 's genuine talent , which lies in an altogether different direction , may be enjoyed by itself .

		That talent takes the form of an insight into the types of character to be found in an English village -- a community of miners and fisher-folk -- that is reaUy remarkable .

		A combination of the shrewd observation and humor of
Dickens	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	is noticeable in many places , and makes the book worth while , despite its heavy load of theological verbiage . ''

		Retz '' is a historical romance vaguely placed in the
fifteenth century	DATE	, when the French monarchy was still struggling with
Burgundy	LOCATION	for supremacy .

		The hero , a scion of an ancient German house , ap - pears upon the scene in
Flanders	LOCATION	at the age of twenty , and proceeds to carve for himself a career .

		He is at once a doughty warrior , a consummate strate - gist , and a Prince Charming ; and he juggles with kings and dukes and bishops in right masterful fash - ion , until he has settled the affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	to his own taste .

		The book fairly reeks with romance , and bears about as much relation to reality as an Arabian Nights ' Entertainment .

		Structurally , it is incoher - ent , but its episodes are exciting enough to make us condone the fault of amorphous plan .

		Who Mr.
Van Zo Post	PERSON	, the author , may be , we do not know ; but we cheerfully allow his dedicatory claim that he has ever followed the torch of the spirit of adventure .

		We learned to know the Princess Dehra from `` The Colonel of the Red Huzzars , '' one of the best of recent '' Zenda '' romances .

		We now resume her charming acquaintance in a book which bears her name as a title , for her inventor , Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	, has ingeniously contrived to make her the heroine of a sequel to his earlier romance .

		The device is very simple .

		The sudden death of the old king leaves the court at sixes and sevens , for the decree which named Armand his successor has mys - teriously disappeared , and the wicked Ferdinand is 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, thereby enabled to scheme anew for the defeat of his rival .

		So the old days of adventure and intrigue are merrily renewed , and the excitement is sustained for the length of another volume , and until the lost decree turns up , which means the final discomfiture of the villain -LRB- it seems to be final -RRB- and the union of Armand with his Princess .

		Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	is a very uneven writer , being capable of producing as puerile a book as '' The Measure of the Rule '' and as fine a specimen of historical romance as '' Tekla . ''

		This unevenness of quality seems to result from an attempt to be more versatile than nature permits . ''

		■ Young Lord
Stran	PERSON	- leigh '' is one of Mr.
Barr	PERSON	's better books -- perhaps one of his best .

		Primarily , it is a tale of adventure , dealing with the discovery of a rich gold-bearing reef near the west coast of
Africa	LOCATION	, and with the attempt of an unscrupidous syndicate to filch the treasure from its rightful claimant .

		As far as plot goes , the narrative is commonplace ; but the character of Lord
Stranleigh	PERSON	gives it the mark of distinction .

		This example of the British aristocracy is to outward seem - ing an indolent and lackadaisical creature , whose chief interests are his food and his apparel .

		But when he is once enlisted in the effort to thwart the wicked syndicate , his affectation of simplicity and helplessness turns out to be no more than the mask of a highly intelligent and resourceful personality .

		The gold is brought safely to
London	LOCATION	, and eventu - ally saves the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	from bankruptcy , which is a sufficiently exciting climax to the story .

		It amounts to some two hundred million pounds sterling , which shows the writer to be possessed of a generous imagination , A rather insignificant novel entitled `` Handi - capped '' is the work of Mr.
Emery Pottle	PERSON	.

		The title is suggestive of the race-track , and the story has a distinctly '' horsey '' flavor .

		The scene is near
New York	LOCATION	, and the interest centres about the rivalry for a maiden 's hand of two men -- an estimable country gentleman and a wild Irish youth who is a cub by nature and a jockey by profession .

		The maiden yields to the Irishman 's tempestuous wooing , but is saved from the consequences of her perverse judgment by a timely accident -LRB- in
Madison Square Garden	LOCATION	-RRB- which eliminates him from the situation .

		The story is natural enough , and exhibits some skill in characterization and dialogue , but does not at any point gain much hold upon the reader 's attention . ''

		Purple and Homespun , '' by Mr ,
Samuel M	PERSON	,
Gardenhire	PERSON	, lives up to its title by introducing us to social types as widely separated as the English aris - tocracy and the denizens of the
East Side	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Gardenhire	PERSON	's noble lords and labor agitators are depicted with equal verisimilitude .

		The book also provides an agreeable mixture of politics and social - ism and financial scheming and human interest .

		Its central figure is a young man of thirty-six who has become a millionaire and a United States Senator by force of native abUity .

		His birth is of the humblest , and the secret knowledge that his father is a drunken old reprobate makes him hesitate a long while before declaring his love for the daughter of the British ambassador ; but he ventures it at last , with a full con - fession , and is rewarded .

		In this respect the story turns out in the anticipated way , but in some others it yields surprises .

		We hardly expect -LRB- from a novel - ist -RRB- that a long-drawn-out sti'uggle between capital and labor will end in anything less exciting than a riot , but in this case it leads only to amicable adjust - ment with the best of feeling on both sides .

		Nor do we expect , when a young woman has been wronged in her youth by a scion of the British aristocracy , that she will do other than spurn him when she reappears as a beautiful and attractive heiress ; but in this case she forgives and forgets , even to the extent of marry - ing her betrayer .

		At first thought , these surprising conclusions suggest a departure from truth to life ; but second thought rather suggests that they are only a departure from truth to the novelist 's convention , and perhaps for that very reason truer to life than most novelistic conclusions , Mr.
Gardenhire	PERSON	's style is stodgy , but he has packed a good deal of experi - ence into his pages , and thereby made them quite readable , Mr.
Herbert M. Hopkins	PERSON	, in his '' ■ Priest and Pagan , '' has given us a neatly-contrived novel of somewhat colorless type .

		The opening smacks of romance , for it tells of the reappearance in
New York	LOCATION	of a man supposed to have been drowned in the
Adriatic	LOCATION
a year before	DATE	; and when we are ap - prised of his intention to keep his escape a secret , and start life over again under a new name , we anti- cipate interesting complications .

		But they do not occur , and the sequel is tame , although it does lead to the hero 's suicide .

		He is the `` pagan '' of the title ; the '' priest '' is the rector of a parish in the
Bronx	LOCATION	, and the heroine , for whom these two contend , is a nice girl who seeks relief from her monotonous suburban existence by doing a vaudeville '' turn '' in a variety theatre .

		Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	has more style than invention , and it is a pity that so carefully wrought a story should not prove more effective .

		The negro question , as viewed by the excitable Southern imagination , is the theme of Mr.
Robert Lee Durham	PERSON	's novel entitled `` The Call of the South . ''

		Mr.
Durham	PERSON	has created a disagreeable situation , and made the most of it .


Hayward Graham	PERSON	is a young man of engaging qualities descended from a line of soldiers , a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	student and famous athlete , but cursed with a strain of negro blood .

		He enlists for the war with
Germany	LOCATION	which has has been brought on by Venezuelan complica - tions , gives distinguished service to his country , and incidentally saves the life of his commanding officer .

		That officer afterwards becomes President , and
Graham	PERSON	becomes a footman in his household em - ployment , having concealed his identity by a change of name .

		The motive for this extraordinary course of action is supplied by his secret admiration for the younger daughter of the President .

		A romantic entanglement follows between the servant and his young mistress , and leads to a clandestine marriage .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 When the secret is known , the consequences are disastrous .

		The President loses his second election , and dies from the shock of disappointment combined with the sense of family disgrace .

		The daughter gives birth to a child who is abhorrent to her sight , and her mind gives way .

		Her husband regnlists as a private in the Philippine service , and the story abruptly ends .

		The purpose of the book is plainly to enforce by a horrible example the argument that any attempt to give social recognition to the negro must needs result in a mingling of the races .

		To our mind , this is a far-fetched conclusion ; but Mr.
Durham	PERSON	represents the view so widely preva - lent in the South and so incomprehensible to the Northern mind .

		The difficulty is a serious one , no doubt ; but there is such a thing as losing one 's head in attempting to deal with it .

		Miss
Margaret Potter	PERSON	, after various romantic excursions into foreign parts and remote periods , has returned , in '' The Golden Ladder , '' to the region of reality .

		It is a very sordid reality which she de - scribes , beginning with life in a
Chicago	LOCATION	boarding - house and ending among the financial monarchs of Wall Street .

		Her hero is a sturdy and ambitious youth from the country , who comes to
Chicago	LOCATION	to set his foot upon the golden ladder which most unimag - inative Americans are trying to climb , and reaches the topmost rung in
New York	LOCATION	, to which metropolis the scene is after a while transferred .

		The heroine -LRB- we call her that in default of a more exact desig - nation -RRB- is a daughter of the woman who keeps the
Chicago	LOCATION	boarding-house , a girl of physical charms and depraved instincts .

		She tempts the youth to sin , and then , not foreseeing his successful future , forsakes him for the garish allurements of the stage .

		When the scene shifts to
New York	LOCATION	, she is far down the road of degradation , while her former lover wins high rank among the manipulators of markets and the promoters of enterprises .

		Gilded wretchedness , although of different kinds , appears to be the final lot of both .

		Miss
Potter	PERSON	's novel is inspired by a fierce indignation , aroused at sight of the mammon - worship which is bringing our civilization near to shipwreck , and she pours unsparing scorn upon American life as she sees it .

		The motive is fine , but the thing is overdone , and misses its proper effect through vehemence of expression .

		Charles
Dudley Warner	PERSON	might have shown her how to do the same thing in a more quiet and artistic manner .

		Miss
Potter	PERSON	has also to learn the value of reticence , for some of her bits of description and dialogue are calculated to bring a blush not to maiden cheeks alone .

		On the whole , we are inclined to think that '' The Golden Ladder '' has done a thing well worth doing after a fashion in which it distinctly ought not to be done .

		We are getting a little tired of the neurotic young woman who makes unreasonable demands upon life , and is unhappy because it turns out to be less excit - ing than she would like to find it .

		A typical example of this sort of woman , who worries over her own emotions until her whole moral fibre is weakened , is found in the heroine of '' The Bond , '' by ''
Neith Boyce	PERSON	. ''

		The marriage bond is what is meant , of course , and it is treated throughout the book as some - thing against which to chafe rather than as an ac - cepted and sacred safeguard .

		The young woman in this particular case has health , a devoted husband , and an artistic gift of her own as a refuge from vagrant thoughts .

		She is , in fact , so happy when first introduced to us that she is quite sure that it can not last , and deliberately sets out to make herself miserable by brooding over an imaginary future of misery .

		This morbid type of character occurs , of course , as a by-product of the life which we moderns lead at such high pressure , and the novelist has a right to describe it ; but she can hardly expect it to appeal to the sympathy of sane and balanced minds .

		The heroine 's destiny is worked out , after a fashion , without external disaster , and she comes to a sort of broken-spirited acceptance of life as it is .

		We could wish that the author 's delicate talent had been em - ployed upon a worthier theme , or a theme bearing a closer relation to normal existence .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		A compact study ^ ^ ^ ^ uld be difficult to Specify a of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's book that more completely fulfils its life and work .

		purpose than Professor
G. Baldwin Brown	PERSON	's volume on Rembrandt -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		To condense into a modest volume of 327 pages a comprehensive study of the life and art of the dis - tinguished
Hollander	PERSON	was a task that could be per - formed in a satisfactory manner only by one having not merely intimate acquaintance with the works of the master , but clearly defined views and aptitude for methodical statement .

		These qualifications Pro- fessor
Brown	PERSON	has in a marked degree , and they are reflected in the well-ordered plan of his book .

		In - stead of combining the biographical , the historical , and the critical aspects of his subject in a continuous narrative , he has treated them in separate divisions ; and in considering
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's output as an artist there is a further division into chapters dealing with his drawings , his etched work , and his paintings .

		In this arrangement there is both advantage and disadvantage .

		The reader is spared the confusion of passing backward and forward between state - ments of fact and higher artistic criticism , but at the cost of a view in which the artist 's works in the dif - ferent media necessarily seem somewhat unrelated , and the steady progression of his development can be kept in mind only by conscious effort on the part of the reader .

		On the other hand , there is gain in convenience for reference , and in compactness .

		In - deed , it is extremely doubtful whether such a mass of information as Professor
Brown	PERSON	gives could be presented in the same amount of space in any other way .

		In the discussion of controverted points .

		Pro- fessor
Brown	PERSON	is careful to present all sides , and his 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, conclusions may be accepted as fairly representing the consensus of opinion of the best authorities .

		Seldom in a popular monograph does one meet with such scholarly treatment , combined with breadth of vision and catholicity of judgment .

		There is perhaps a trifle too much insistence upon subjective qualities , such as the profundity of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's insight into character ; and not quite enough stress is laid upon the purely aesthetic side of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's art .

		In the main , however , the author has kept closely to the view which he states with such admirable clearness : '' The general conception of a piece from the point of view of its subject , and its envisagement as a composition in form and colour , are , in the theory of modern painting , a single act .

		It is not the case of a thought consciously and deliberately clothed in an artistic dress , but of a thought that would have no existence save in so far as it is expressible in art . ''

		Without illustrations , a book of this kind would be shorn of much of its utUity as well as attractiveness .

		Excellent half-tone reproductions of forty-eight of Rembrandt 's works are given , the list including a number of those not commonly seen , as well as many of his recognized masterpieces .

		Ample indexes are included ; and we miss only , what would have been a desirable addition , a bibliography of the more im - portant among the very large number of books of which the great Dutch master is the subject .

		Taking it all in all , Professor
Brown	PERSON	has given us the best book on
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's life and work that has been prepared for the general reader .

		Without comprehending the principle ^ ZIifaaL ^ `` f relationship which led Dr. Stop - ford
A. Brooke	PERSON	to group together four such diverse men and poets as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
A. H. Clough	PERSON	,
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	, and
William Morris	PERSON	in one volume with the title '' Four Victorian Poets '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- , we can still appreciate the insight and illumi - nation of his treatment of them .

		A review of the history of English poetry from
1822	DATE	to 1852 forms an introductory chapter , wherein stress is placed upon the reaction from the democratic ideas of Shelley and
Byron	PERSON	, the interval of lethargy , and the revival of political , artistic , and religious freedom .

		`` Into the midst of this whirlpool of thoughts and hopes and passions , political , social , ideal , democratic , but chiefly religious and theological ,
Clough	PERSON	and Arnold were cast . ''

		These two men are associated in our memories both as friends and fellow-sufferers from the disturbed intellectual and theological con - ditions which tended to foster doubts and a '' stoic sadness '' in the earlier manhood of both poets . ''

		Our troubled day '' is what Arnold called it .

		Dr.
Brooke	PERSON	has said truly that '' nearly all of
Arnold	LOCATION	's best poetry has an elegiac note . ''

		Clough 's mental and spiritual conflicts are traced from his
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	days to the last years of a life which seemed to end prematurely , '' as he passed from the speculative to the constructive phase of thought . ''

		Rossetti and
Morris	PERSON	are natu - rally joined in several characterizations ; they both rebelled against the sordid life and speculative criti - cism of their age , and both , like
Keats	PERSON	, turned to the past for inspiration .

		Although
Morris	PERSON	in later life , urged into contact with the darker phases of existence by his '' passionate humanity , '' became enlisted in the cause of socialism , yet as a young man he was more detached from his age than
Rossetti	PERSON	was .

		The latter 's quality of '' unwearied symbolism , '' in both painting and poetry , is emphasized , as well as the fusion of Italian and English influences in his work .

		Morris , like
Arnold	PERSON	, was felicitous in his recital of great stories of the past , his range of subjects includ - ing legends and hero-tales of Greek , mediaeval , and
Norse	ORGANIZATION	history .

		Whether remembered as a poet , socialist , or artistic craftsman , his dominant trait will be found in idealism , in hope and faith of a better future , poetized in such diverse visions as '' News from Nowhere '' and '' The Message of the
March Wind	DATE	. ''

		All general histories describe the wanderings of this body of legislative-executives ; but it has remained for Mr.
Varnum Lansing Collins	PERSON	in '' The
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	at Princeton '' -LRB-
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Library -RRB- to make a special study of the coming of the

		The period was that really following the Revolutionary War , and might be considered unin - teresting save for the fact that here began to be manifest that general apathy in public life which eventually well-nigh ruined the experiment of the republic before matters were righted by the
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia Convention .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	's work is published , appropriately , by the
University Library of Prince	ORGANIZATION	- ton , and the author has given a Princeton setting to the whole .

		His chapter on Princeton in
1783	DATE	, that on the reception given the Congressional visitors , and on the presence of the members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at the annual Commencement exercises of the College , pre - sent a true picture of the accustomed quiet of the
Jersey	LOCATION	village , broken by this momentous incursion .

		Monotony of narrative is prevented by the descrip - tions of the visit of
General Washington	LOCATION	to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, of the arrival of the Dutch minister , and of the theft from the vUlage postoffice of a mail-bag which con - tained the official correspondence of the members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author has collected his material from original and authentic sources , and has fashioned it into a readable narrative .

		The volume is one that wiU appeal to the general reading public , and is yet of value to the student .

		THE DIAL 93 British Colonial ^ ince the publication , two years ago , Administration oi Mr.
AUeyne	PERSON
Ireland	LOCATION	s important in the
Far East	LOCATION	, ^ ^ rk on the '' Far Eastern Tropics , '' the appearance of his larger and more important work on ''
Colonial Administration	ORGANIZATION	in the Far East '' has been awaited with interest .

		The first two volumes are now issued , with the imprint of
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are given entirely to
Burma	LOCATION	, and excite admiration by their thorough - ness and compactness , and wonder at the immense amount of labor and preparation which they imply .

		With untiring industry the author has gathered and tabulated a vast amount of information on every branch of the colonial administration in
Burma	LOCATION	and on every interest in the Province , which has hitherto been available only by reference to a multitude of scattered reports , issued by many departments , deal - ing often with only a limited period of time , avail - able only by journeyings to the offices and chanceries concerned , and known there frequently only to those attached to that particular branch of the ser - vice .

		Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	expressly says in his preface that `` no attempt has been made to make the report attractive to the general reader ; no effort has been expended in giving the work an appearance of originality , which , whilst it might perhaps add some - thing to the literary reputation of the reporter , would detract from the utility of the work . ''

		The work is therefore a book of reference only , but it is one of distinct and unique value .

		According to the plan which Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	has imposed upon himself , his own criticisms and conclusions will follow the com - pletion of the Report proper , and will be contained in a final volume .

		All the other colonial adminis - trations , British and foreign , are to be similarly treated , presumably with equal thoroughness and accuracy .

		It is to be hoped that this important and meritorious enterprise will appeal not in vain for public appreciation and support , especially for that of reference libraries where it must become a useful and indispensable handbook in its field .

		books of travel vie with fiction in popularity as light literature , and the clever author has learned to combine the two genres into a divert - ing mixture of guidebook and romance .


Anne Warner	PERSON	's '' Seeing England with Uncle John '' -LRB- Cen - tury Co. -RRB- is an unusually entertaining example of this type .

		Uncle
John	PERSON	is a truly comic character , as good in his way as the inimitable
Susan Clegg	PERSON	; and in spite of the pitfalls of the sequel , he is just as funny in
England	LOCATION	as he was in
France	LOCATION	-- which means that his creator has an excellent understanding of both the satiric method and the foibles of the elderly Amer - ican gentleman who goes travelling , apparently , just to get it over with .

		Baggage , fires , and Baedeker supply Uncle John with standing causes for dissatis - faction , while each place he rushes through adds its special grievance to his long list of such .

		His mono - logues to his long-suffering companion , DUlyj and to his neice
Yvonne	PERSON	and her husband , supply the humor ; and
Yvonne	PERSON	's letters to her mother , recounting the various stages in her vain pursuit of Uncle
John	PERSON	through
Scotland	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, describe the things that Uncle
John	PERSON	might have seen , but did n't , owing to his haste and the misadventures that dog his erratic course .

		Yvonne is as typical as Uncle
John	PERSON	, and almost as funny .

		Dilly and some of the minor char - acters are a little overdone , -- and so , we think , is
Yvonne	PERSON	's ceaseless flow of information , which lacks the strongly personal note needed to give it interest .

		As information , however , it seems to be thoroughly reliable ; and an index -- the preparation of which , the author declares , was a much longer task than the writing of the book -- makes reference to particular facts easy .

		„ Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	's fifth series critical and of '' Shelburne Essays '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- bioaraphical .

		j ^ ^ ve , with two exceptions , the fa - miliar footnote which shows them to be , in form at least , reviews of current publications ; and one of these exceptions -LRB- `` The Praise of Dickens '' -RRB- is inspired by the fine `` National Edition '' of the perennially popular novelist and by current appre - ciations of his work , while the other -LRB- `` The Cen - tenary of Longfellow '' -RRB- has necessarily much of the character of a critical review .

		The chapters , eleven in number , are already famUiar to readers of `` The Nation '' ; the
Longfellow	LOCATION	essay , however , appeared in `` The
Washington	LOCATION	University Bulletin . ''

		In the pages of so accomplished a literary artist as Mr.
More	PERSON	one looks for , and finds , many an apt phrase that lingers in the mind .

		`` The jumping staccato of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	'' and '' Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's ebullition of doubtful epigrams '' refresh us more , probably , than they will Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		This is an account of all that went on in the fortress from the outbreak of hostilities to its surrender in

M. Nojine	PERSON	, who was the accredited war correspondent in the fortress , has , in addition to the daily happenings , described the moral influences leading to a capitulation , which under other circumstances might have been post - poned for several months .

		The book tells of the surrender of forts without the knowledge of the Commandant of the fortress ; of how General
Stossel	PERSON	was twice recalled in
June , 1904	DATE	, by
Kuropatkin	PERSON	; how he concealed the messages to him - self and destroyed the telegrams sent at the same time to

1589	DATE	.

		In
1562	DATE	Catherine was the most important person in
France	LOCATION	.

		Whatever conces - sions are made for the moral standard of that age , we can not but read with horror and amazement of the unscrupulous methods employed in the corrupt politics of the time .

		In the conflict of parties nothing could withstand the lust of power , and the lives of great leaders were unhesitatingly sacrificed to conserve the throne to
Catherine	PERSON	and her sons .

		The dom - inating figure of Coligny , the dramatic contest between him and
Catherine	PERSON	, his relations with the vascillating King ,
Charles IX.	PERSON	, occupy the stage during the ten years between
1562	DATE	and
1572	DATE	, followed by the culminating horror , the Bar - tholomew massacre of

		THE DIAL 101 NEW BOOKS by
GEORGE P. UPTON MR. UPTON	PERSON	has probably been an observer and writer on musical matters in this country for a longer period than almost anyone now living .

		His contributions to musical literature have been many and varied , and his more practical books have come to be regarded as standard .

		In addition to the most thorough knowledge of all possible technicalities , he has been exceptionally endowed with a charmingly intimate style , and an almost inexhaustible memory .

		For the present season , besides his invaluable contributions to juvenile literature , he has prepared two volumes widely different in character , but both of the greatest possible interest to music lovers , and music students ; and in the first book described , to that previous generation which loves to have revived its memories of half a century ago .

		MUSICAL MEMORIES My Recollections of Famous Celebrities , 1850-1900 .

		Active and aggressive as is music in
America	LOCATION	in the present day , for the real old timers among music lovers it holds no names and achievements like those of the '' palmy days '' early in the last half of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		During this entire period Mr.
Upton	PERSON	was engaged in active musical criticism in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and had an unusual opportunity to observe what was happening in the musical world .

		He heard all of the great singers , and with many of them he enjoyed an intimate personal acquaintance .

		In these recollections he has drawn almost entirely on his own notes and has made very little use of history and biography ; as a result , there is a delightful personal flavor about these reminiscences , a quality of kindliness , that makes a rare and genial volume in every sense .

		As the public is sufficiently familiar in these days with artists still upon the stage , he has confined these '' Memories '' only to those who have retired into the shady nooks of life , and to that other goodly company for whom , in the last words of Canio in '' Pagliacci , '' '' La comedia e finita .

		NOTES 120 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 121 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 122 THE WORL D OF WONDER .

		The scene is in
Iceland	LOCATION	, and the year is 1220 .

		There has been a day of battle between the Bishop and the opposing chieftains .

		`` Arnor said to
Sighvat	LOCATION	, ` It has been a hard bout , kinsman ! ' ''

		` Aye , hard indeed ! '

		says he .

		`` Arnorsaid : ' I have been poorly all the
summer	DATE	; but when word came to me from Reekdale that they wanted help , all my aches left me , so that now I am as fresh as ever I was in my life . ' ''

		` That is what you might call a miracle , ' said Sighvat . ''

		Amor answers : ' It is what I would call an occur - rence , and not a miracle . ' ''

		This anecdote from the sagas is given us by Professor
Ker	PERSON	in an address made to the
Viking Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has an obvious moral for any age , possibly more for our own than for most others , and may be particularly recommended to the at - tention of those who waste their energies in the pursuit of the will-o-the-wisps of certain forms of pseudo-philosophy which are much in vogue at the present day , and which are the despair of the rational intelligence .

		The conception of an ordered and law-bound universe , which is the chief conquest of science , and which the advanc - ing years steadily solidify , falls dishearteningly short of general acceptance .

		The heredity of the race at large predisposes most men to prefer imagination to observation , and to welcome what is irrational because it satisfies the instinctive craving for wonder .

		Now this craving for wonder is too essential an attribute of the human spirit to be ignored by science , or to be contemptuously ruled out of court in the great cause of man versus nature .

		Imagination has a claim upon the mind no less legitimate than fact , and the dry light of reason is naturally less attractive than the iridescent coloring of fancy .

		But the two are not hope - lessly at odds , as a superficial view would seem to set them , and the real world of science affords abundant scope for the exercise of the faculty of wonder .

		As science extends its boimdaries , new Alps on Alps arise before its broadening view , and the mysteries which satisfy the child - ish imagination are replaced by mysteries of more unfathomable depth .

		The function of knowledge is indeed to regulate the imagination , but at the same time to afford it a vaster scope than ever before .

		Truly '' on her forehead sits 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, a fire '' potent to reveal hitherto unapprehended realms of wonder to the clarified vision .

		But just as the truest freedom of human action lies within the limits of submission to social law -LRB- as Goethe knew -RRB- , so the genuine freedom of the imagination is to be achieved , not by flouting science , but by accepting its restraining intel - lectual guidance .

		The quarrel of science , then , is not with the imagination as such , but with its superstitious vagaries and its perversities of flight .

		It clings to the toys of childhood when it might instead rejoice in the use of the instruments of explora - tion which science so freely offers .

		The cheap imposture of '' spiritualism ' still numbers by thousands its willingly deluded victims , and its superstitious taint may be detected , although disguised by refined verbiage , in some of our highest-sounding philosophies .

		There is no essential difference between the '' messages '' delivered , through knockings or otherwise , by the vulgarest of charlatans , and the drivel of such familiars as '' Mr.
Phinuit	PERSON	'' as reported by our gravest adepts in psychical research .

		That crude manifestations of either sort should be taken seriously as attesting the existence of a spirit-world affords a melancholy illustration of the depths to which credulity may descend .

		It takes
Thoreau	PERSON	s vigorous language to char - acterize adequately the state of mind which is moved by such evidence . ''

		Most people here -LSB- in
Concord	LOCATION	-RSB- believe in a spirit - ual world which no respectable junk bottle , which had not met with a slip , would condescend to contain even a portion of for a moment , -- whose atmosphere would extinguish a candle let down into it , like a well that wants airing ; in spirits which the very bullfrogs in our meadows would blackball . ''

		Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	has dwelt at much length upon the fact that the literature of the nine - teenth century , in its reaction from the didactic materialism of the eighteenth , is chiefly char - acterized by a revival of the sense of wonder .

		Man is governed by two great impulses , '' the impulse to take unchallenged and for granted all the phenomena of the outer world as they are , and the impulse to confront these phenomena with eyes of inquiry and wonder . ''

		Yet the very century which is thus marked is also the one in which positive knowledge has made more gigantic strides than in any century preceding .

		So far from deadening the sense of wonder , this increasing rationalization of the world for human consciousness has made it ever more strange in its underlying meaning , and more pregnant in its spiritual possibilities .

		This ap - pears to be a paradox , but it is the expression of a highly significant truth .

		Science admits it in such words as these of Huxley : '' Anyone who is practically acquainted with scientific work is aware that those who refuse to go be - yond fact , rarely get as far as fact . '' ''

		Natural knowledge , seeking to satisfy natural wants , has found the ideas which can alone still spiritual cravings . ''

		But , as we have already urged , while science opens new vistas of legitimate wonder , there is always the danger for undis - ciplined minds , that they will find in its teach - ings , imperfectly apprehended , only a new warrant for straying into the bog of supersti - tion in pursuit of some will-o - the - wisp of the unregulated imagination .

		So deep-seated is the irrational instinct in our imperfectly developed nature , so prone are the most intelligent of men to abdicate at times the throne of thought and mingle incognito with the superstitious popidace , that one now and then almost despairs of the human mind , and is tempted to give up the strenuous search for ultimate truth and take refuge in that comfort - able philosophy which teaches that truth is whatever men wish to believe and think is good for them .

		This sugar-coated gospel of intellec - tual despair , this specious plea for opportunism in the management of the intellectual processes , is just now very much in fashion , but its evasion of all the difficulties at issue does not exactly commend it to the entirely serious thinker .

		It is discouraging , indeed , to make a list of some of the men who have most deeply influenced our modern age , a list including such men as
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Ruskin	PERSON	and Arnold and Renan and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, men whose nobility of temper com - mands our respect and even our veneration , and then ask , with a recent English critic : '' Is there any one of them who has not tried at times to storm our judgment instead of convincing it , or has not bewildered our mind by some perversity or extravagance ? ''

		The critic just quoted is writing about
Lord Morley	PERSON	, who stands in contrast with such men as have above been named because `` he never leaves us in doubt about his meaning , motive , or method . ''

		And then follows this striking sentence : '' The chief reason why he is a stand - ard writer is that he is a standard mind , and at a time when standard minds are rare . ''

		Now the standard mind does not waver before the gusts of doctrine , because it is convinced of a fundamental order in the universal structure .

		But its abiding belief in such an order serves only to heighten its sense of wonder as it studies the workings of the cosmic process .

		Such a
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105 conviction does not desiccate the mind , but swells it with the sap of luxuriant growth .

		It is Lord
Morley	PERSON	who , in the very cause of war - fare upon superstition , pays tribute to the '' moods of holiness , awe , reverence , and silent worship of an unseen not made with hands '' which are among the unalienable riches of the human spirit .

		The mind that has truly recon - ciled itself with universal law does not chafe under the salutary restraint , and the wonders which it has discarded as childish figments give place to others , sublimer far , as the imagination rises to loftier planes .

		In the new world of wonder thus revealed there is abundant room for romance , even if ghosts are banished , and for a religious faith that needs no miracles as crutches to support its tottering footsteps , but that stands erect in its own strength , with shin - ing eyes directed toward the unseen .

		^ CASUAL COMMENT .

		The iniquities of book-publishers form a theme apparently of perennial charm .

		Just why this particular class of business men should be singled out for wholesale reprobation in the public prints would be harder to understand were we not to take into account the nature of their business and the usual source of the attacks .

		The production and sale of books , while essentially a commercial function , is in a sense a semi-literary one also , and this makes its doings and methods matters of interest in the literary world .

		Then it is an old , old story , that the relation of publisher and author is one that it is not always possible to manage sweetly ; and when disagreements come and antagonisms arise , what more natural than that the author with a grievance , imaginary or real , should find his handiest and most effective weapon in his pen ?

		He is , in fact , too handy in its use ; he is often hasty , sometimes angry , and liable to write not wisely but too well .

		Such a Boanerges of the pen has lately appeared in the columns of the once decorous '' Academy '' of
London	LOCATION	, in an article bear - ing the ingratiating heading , '' The Insolent Pub - lisher . ''

		Of course after such a happy beginning we know at once that all will go affably and well .

		And we are not disappointed ; the gentleman certainly has a full pen , and writes up to his heading .

		To him , the Publisher -LRB- generically speaking ; he does n't bother with him individually -RRB- is not only '' insolent '' wherever his dealings with authors are concerned , -- he is '' a huckster in intellect , '' '' ignorant and puffed up , '' '' impudent , greedy , vain , '' as lacking in courtesy and manners as he is '' pusillanimous '' and imbecile in his business methods .

		He has various other un - desirable qualities , but the chief and most unendur - able one is his invsuperable insolence .

		He has '' an insolent view of the public , an insolent and contempt - uous view of the serious author , and an insolent and contemptuous view of the whole business of letters '' ; with the crowning culpability of being '' a waddling mass of insolence . ''

		With which unflattering picture of the lordly British publisher , we leave him to the mercies of his countrymen and his reckoning with the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		Coming back to our own land , we find a recent article , very different in sub - stance as well as in regard for the amenities of civil - ization , not to say of literature , but containing some pretty strenuous criticism of book-publishers , in the pages of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly . ''

		This article is on '' Honest Literary Criticism '' -- something which it says does not exist in
America	LOCATION	.

		This is rightly regarded as a grave defect ; and the charge against the publishers is a serious one when the author de - clares that the fault is primarily theirs .

		This charge , repeated in many forms , runs through the dozen pages of the article .

		This author too has his bogy , which he tirelessly pursues .

		Not the publisher in his capacity of Insolent One , but in that of the Silent Bargainer , is the object of his attack . ''

		The Silent Bargain '' -- something weird and mysterious , like
Lawson	PERSON	's furious one-sided combat with `` The Sys - tem '' or
Faust	ORGANIZATION	's compact with the Devil -- is the device by which American publishers have accom - plished the wholesale debauchery of American lit - erary criticism .

		This sinister `` Silent Bargain '' is made by the book-publisher with the publisher of book reviews , and consists simply in the use of adver - tisements as bribes for favorable notices of books .

		It is a quiet affair , but business-like and effective : nothing need really be said , -- the understanding is , `` No favorable notices , no advts , '' and that is all there is about it .

		This is the spirit and the practice , according to this writer , dominating literary criti - cism in this country .

		The statements are made in a large generic sense -- like saying that all men are liars , which even in our hlase day is thought too sweeping , and likely to do injustice to the few pos - sible exceptions when a comparatively truthful man is found here and there in the byways and corners of the land .

		It may be that the rash Scriptural generalizer 's preliminary utterance -- `` I said in my haste '' -- could be meditated with profit by this froward critic of criticism in
America	LOCATION	.

		• • • The life of a busy and useful bookman was that of Mr.
A. R. Spofford	PERSON	, which came to an end
last month	DATE	, after more than fourscore years .

		Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	began active life , before he was twenty years old , as a bookseller and publisher in
Cincin	LOCATION	- nati ; he then spent several years in journalism , in the same city .

		His life-work , however , was in the
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	, where , as librarian or assistant , he was in continuous service for nearly half a century .

		Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	's interest in books did not concern merely their care and cus - tody ; his knowledge of their contents was prodi - gious , and covered all subjects and many languages .

		If a visitor to the library wished material for a 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, speech , an article , a sermon , or a book , Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	's ready hand , guided by his inexhaustible memory , found at once the desired volume , -- if not on the crowded shelves of the old
Congressional Library	ORGANIZATION	, then with equal readiness it was plucked from the pile upon the floor , the desk , the chair , the table , wherever it temporarily reposed in a disorder that was hopeless to others but never seemed to trouble him .

		Sometimes when a book was not in his own library he would tell at once in what library it could be found , and even its location -- in what particular stack or alcove , on what shelf , and even what posi - tion on the shelf ; and he was seldom at fault , either in locating the book or in its proving to be the right one for the case .

		But with all his wonderful knowl - edge of books , there was one kind that he could not or did not care to understand -- account books ; and this defect at one time came very near involving him in a serious difficulty with the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	as librarian had charge of fees received from copyrights entered in his office as required by law ; and when his accounts were audited , in
1895	DATE	, it was found that he was
$ 22,000	MONEY	short .

		This was an astounding disclosure -- probably to no one more so than to Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	.

		He had no idea what had become of the money , and as no one suspected him of dishonesty his friends made good the shortage and the
Government	ORGANIZATION	accepted the settlement .

		When , a little later , the library was removed to its new build - ing , the astonishing discovery was made that the drawers in Mr.
Spofford	PERSON	's desk contained large amounts of money -- bills , money orders , checks -- stuffed away among dusty papers accumulating during a period of a quarter of a century .

		He was allowed to keep the money , which he had already replaced , but was wisely relieved of further responsi - bilities of a financial nature .

		The position of assist - ant librarian , which he held for the last ten years of his life , pleased him better , as it enabled him to give all his time and energies to the kind of books he really understood -- which , as has been said , included all kinds but account books .

		• • • The advantages of the smaller colleges is a matter much discussed of late , particularly in connection with Mr.
John Corbin	PERSON	's book , '' Which College for the Boy ? ''

		lately reviewed in our pages .

		The interest of the subject may justify a quotation from a thoughtful and sensible letter that has come to our notice in a
New York	LOCATION	journal . ''

		Why these plaints , '' asks the writer , `` from discouraged mothers and others about popular education in the
East	LOCATION	, when there are a dozen or more colleges whose doors are open at trifling expense to the ambitious and industrious student , institutions which offer as good courses in the classics , modern literature , mathematics , history and philosophy , as the large university ? ''

		Then follows some not extravagant praise of the writer 's own college ,
Middlebury	LOCATION	, in
Vermont	LOCATION	, where his '' fees to the college during the entire four years ' course amounted to less than .

		.

		The great universities have their advan - tages , and they are open to those who can afford them .

		By many , however , the advantages of the small college , for undergraduate work , are con - sidered superior , irrespective of expense .

		Be that as it may , the small
New England	LOCATION	college offers to those of slender purses four years of wholesome , gladsome life in the country , and a college educa - tion the worth of which is dependent upon the char - acter of the student himself . ''

		It is the after life in the great world that tests the worth of the pre - paratory training , and many useful lives and noble characters owe much of their foundation to the smaller but by no means inferior colleges , in the West as in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The '' still air of delightful studies '' so dear to
Milton	PERSON	is not exactly the prev - alent air at our monster universities , with their students numbering into the thousands , and their activities and interests counted by the score or by the hundred .

		... Free libraries in the Dark Continent are shooting their radiant beams in an ever-widening circle .

		Not that public libraries are yet very plenti - ful in the
Desert of Sahara	LOCATION	or in the rubber forests of the
Congo	LOCATION	; but in
South Africa	LOCATION	, within the juris - diction of Dr.
Muir	PERSON	, Superintendent General of Edu - cation in
Cape Colony	ORGANIZATION	, there has been a rapid growth of these institutions within the last fifteen years .

		The schoolhouse serves as the natural depository for these collections of books ; the separate library building will come later .

		The remarkable growth in this department of public education is thus reported by the Superintendent : `` In
1892	DATE	there were only twenty-two school libraries in circulation ;
five years later	DATE	there were 123 ; the following five years saw the number doubled , and the total of
1902	DATE	-LRB- 247 -RRB- was trebled by
1907	DATE	-LRB- 733 -RRB- .

		But the past twelve months have witnessed the most remarkable headway of all , for in
May , 1908	DATE	, there were no fewer than
1548	DATE	libraries scattered throughout the schools of the colony .

		These libraries are somewhat unevenly dis - tributed among the different school board areas , and in size they range from the modest bookcase , with its couple of dozen books , in many a private farm - school , to the well-stocked shelves of some of our colleges , where a couple of thousand volumes are available .

		The
Cape	LOCATION	division is in the proud posi - tion of having a library for every school , and the combined collections , if we mistake not , contain some 30,000 books . ''

		... The sterility of optimism , so far as the pro- duction of soul-stirring works of literature is con - cerned , is touched upon by the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation '' almost at the same time -LRB- curiously enough -RRB- with Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	's treatment of the theme in the course of his recent Dial article on '' The Solidarity of Literature . ''

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	made our optimism and lack of depth '' largely due to our material success , and to the fact that we have never known , as a nation , defeat , despair , and crushing grief . ''

		A remarkable similarity of thought is to be
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 107 noted in the English writer 's article . ''

		What weighs on our novelists , '' he declares , `` with even greater pressure -LSB- than insincerity in dealing with sex problems -RSB- is the optimistic idealism which has the greatest aversion for any picture of life that is sombre , tragic , or even uncompromising .

		This mental temper ... makes directly for lack of depth in our novelists ... Should our national prosperity have to meet the rude shock of a European war , or grave peril to any part of the empire , we should immediately see arrive a far more serious school of writers to interpret for us the handwriting on our walls . ''

		Illustrations of the quickening influence of national adversity upon a nation 's literature are spread before us in the history of
Italy	LOCATION	, of
Poland	LOCATION	, of
Hungary	LOCATION	, -- and , prosaically prosperous though we are , of our own country in its internecine conflict over slavery .

		Yet , though we do not deny the soul of goodness in things evil , and the office of suffer - ing in revealing life 's deeper meanings , it is hard to believe that misery and anguish and even the dark - ness of deadly sin constitute the only soil whence springs the literature of power . ''

		L' Allegro '' has its potent charm no less than '' II Penseroso . ''

		• • • The kindliness of authors has been less written about than their irritability and bad temper .

		Walter Savage Landor 's tempestuous outbursts of passion are more striking than
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	's little unremembered acts of kindness and of love .

		The throwing of a dinner service -- china , silverware , viands , tablecloth and all -- out of the window into the garden , is more theatrical than listening on a bed of pain to a would-be novelist 's reading of his own crude attempts at story-writing ; nevertheless one is glad to preserve the memory of such unobtrusive services to struggling authors , -- and Mrs.
Moulton	PERSON	's life was full of them .

		As a sympathetic notice of her death puts it , `` she did not seek requital ; she did not demand gratitude ; she asked only opportunity to confer benefits .

		Her reward was to be beloved to a degree known to very few women . ''

		She seems to have had no enemies , impossible though it is often asserted to be to make warm friends without at the same time creating enmity in other quarters .

		Even envy and malice from her own sex shrank ashamed from attacking one so eager to turn her own success to the profit of others .

		• • • Open or closed shelves for public libraries is a matter in which a judicious compromise seems the better plan .

		Sufficient freedom for practical and sensible purposes can be given without turning the public loose in the book-stack , while special permis - sion for unrestricted freedom can be accorded in special cases .

		This plan , already noted by us as in operation at
Peoria	LOCATION	, is favored by Mr.
Ranck	PERSON	, the Grand Rapids librarian , whose methods and aims have occasionally in the past furnished matter for approving comment in these columns .

		In his recent Annual Report he says : '' The need of a larger place in which to keep a well-selected collection of twelve or fifteen thousand volumes is being felt more and more every year .

		A collection of this number of volumes would answer the needs of perhaps 80 or 90 per cent of the adults who use the
Circulation Department	ORGANIZATION	; and to have a relatively small , well - selected collection of this kind would be of greater service than to have free access to the whole collec - tion of the Library 's books . ''

		The whole collection , it may be added , is about ninety-three thousand volumes .

		... How to enjoy books , though a librarian , is not an insoluble problem , any more than is '' how to be happy , though married . ''

		For the third time in its more than thirty years ' history , the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at its late convention devoted its attention to books rather than to methods of handling and housing and circulating books .

		Such papers as that by Mr.
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	, of the
Wisconsin Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, on '' The Dear and Dumpy Twelves , '' and the one by Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	on '' How to Get Parkman Read '' -- followed by bright , snappy , two-minute talks on various noteworthy books -- helped to remind the assembled librarians that literature may serve other uses besides cataloguing and classifying and shelf - listing and gum-labelling .

		Those who -LRB- often to their sorrow -RRB- have so much to do with the mere outsides and perishable materialities of books like now and then to have it newly impressed upon them that worth makes the book , the want of it the tiresome imitation , and the rest is all but leather -LRB- or more often cloth -RRB- and laminated wood-pulp .

		.

		• • The vogue of devotional hymns , when the hymns really appeal to the people , is something pass - ing belief .

		That the collection of '' Gospel Hymns '' bearing the name of
Ira D. Sankey	PERSON	, who has re - cently died , was a popular book , must have been patent to anyone at all curious in the matter .

		The occasion of the hymn-writer 's death has brought to public notice the fact that this work and the same author 's , or more properly compiler 's , '' Sacred Songs , '' '' Gospel Choir , '' and '' Christian Endeavor Hymn Book '' have circulated to the extent of more than fifty million copies .

		And yet there are those who assert that the English and the Americans are not music-lovers .

		Perhaps they would even cite the foregoing in confirmation of their assertion .

		• • • Base uses of famous houses might furnish a theme for a long chapter in literary history .

		The same wind that wafts to our shores reports of the saving of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's house at Nether Stowey , of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's father 's house at
Lichfield	LOCATION	, of
Balzac	LOCATION	's house in the suburbs of
Paris	LOCATION	, and of other historic dwellings , brings news of the conversion of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's
Denmark Hill	LOCATION	house at
Camberwell	LOCATION	, where he wrote parts of `` Modern Painters , '' into `` a boarding-house for gentlemen . ''

		Surely , the irony of fate could no farther go .

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, COMMUNICA TIONS .

		MILTON 'S '' COMUS '' IN WESTERN WOODS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of Thb Dial . -RRB-

		The writer thinks it but a simple act of justice , as well as a matter of interest to your readers , to make some mention in your columns of a literary event of such merit and distinction as the recent open-air perform - ances of Milton 's '' Comus '' by the
Donald Robertson	PERSON	Company at
Ravinia Park	LOCATION	.

		It is not often that those who care for the greatest poetry are offered such an opportunity of high enjoyment .

		It must be admitted , first of all , that there were serious flaws in at least the rendering seen by the present writer .

		The worst of these were a number of most regrettable lapses of memory , by most of the actors , in the delivery of the lines , every syllable of which is sacred to the lover of poetry .

		Then , the parts of the two
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	were very inadequately conceived , and distinctly below the level of the other acting .

		Again , one could have dis - pensed with some part of the uproar , especially that of the dancing village swains , which too closely recalled that of Comus 's crew , but lately subsided .

		But one is glad to have done with these obvious criticisms , and go on to the grateful task of trying to express something of the delight which the masque awakened .

		Turf and trees and moonlight contributed their gentle influences ; but the charm , the real poetic atmosphere , emanated from the actors who so fully entered into the power and beauty of the verse .

		Of course the recitation of lines so complex , with inversions and word-uses so remote from the familiar , is one of the difficulties of the piece , increased by the conditions of delivery in the open air .

		Another is the great length of the speeches ; while of course not all minds can be moved by the lofty thoughts which inspired Milton in the composition .

		But these obstacles seemed , for the most part , to lend wings to the imaginations of Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	and his chief players .

		Miss
Marion Redlich	PERSON	as the Attendant Spirit , and Thyrsis ,
Miss John	LOCATION	as the Lady , and Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	as Comus , were more than satisfying ; they really inspired .

		They delivered the great verse with a fitting sense of its meaning and beauty ; they succeeded in creating a genuine poetic illusion ; they brought out to the full the deep spiritual force of the piece .

		Miss
Redlich	PERSON	brought to the part of the Spirit a high sweetness and earnestness which made the shepherd disguise ever transparent , and opened and closed the action with a worthy music .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's Comus well expressed
Milton	PERSON	's con - ception , -- a being rooted in sensual evil , yet intellectual enough to play the philosopher and to find the best part of the game in the enslavement of others ; high enough , also , to feel the moral beauty of the Lady , and to quail and suffer before its light .

		The beautiful imaginative poetry of the lines received from Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	a treat - ment truly sympathetic .

		Of Miss
Alice John	PERSON	as the Lady one hardly knows how to speak without seeming extravagance .

		The nobility of her conception of the part was assisted by her per - sonal graces , her nobility of head and form and bearing .

		Simplicity was rightly the key-note of all .

		Milton 's own Lady was a gentlewoman , acting a heightened and transfigured version of an experience of her own , made lastingly beautiful by the utmost art of a great poet .

		As such a gentlewoman , under such conditions , appeared Miss
John	PERSON	.

		Nothing there was of the cheap or mere - tricious , nothing of the trivial twang of the stage .

		At her first appearance , lost in the benighted wood , a girl 's fright and weakness were expressed as simply but convinc - ingly as
Madame Modjeska	ORGANIZATION	used , on her first entrance in '' Twelfth Night , '' to put before us the sufferings and weariness of the shipwrecked Viola .

		But her womanly strength shines out when , in her perplexity , she resolves to have faith , to trust the promised protection of Comus ; and its clear unquenchable light beams still but radiant throughout the temptation scene .

		Miss
John	PERSON	's work is too quiet , with the quietness of strength , fine and true , to catch the applause of those whom only contortion and violence can move ; but all who care for the deep beauty of this scene must find satisfying food for thought in her rendering of it , -- her calm reliance , amid the obvi - ous bewilderment of sense , on an inward strength ; her expression of profound , still passion of the soul , which leaves the mind all clear to refute the wily sophistry of the false god .

		The delicious song and dancing of the nymph
Sabrina	PERSON	-LRB- Greorgie Kennicott -RRB- in her rush-and-lily adorned dress , with water-sprites attending , delightfully closed the main action of the piece , whose incidental music , it must be added , is as charming as
Milton	LOCATION	's praises would lead us to fancy .

		Milton 's genius was not dramatic , and a masque is not a play .

		The interplay of action and emotions on individuals is not the interest to seek in such a com - position , which is to the full drama somewhat as early Tuscan bas-relief to sculpture in the roimd .

		The Comus indeed '' masks '' in the guise of persons high thoughts and the passion of
Milton	LOCATION	's philosophic youth .

		To suc - ceed , as these actora have done , in making poetry so lofty and so exquisite live and take shape , is a high achievement .

		A CORRECTION FROM CAPTAIN
AMUNDSEN	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In connection with your review of Captain Amund - sen 's book , '' The North - West Passage , '' in The Dial of
August 16	DATE	, we note in the last paragraph that your reviewer points out some inaccuracies in the text , namely , first of all that the '' Gjoa '' is made to sail through
Bellot	PERSON	, wliile the context and map show that it passed by it .

		We have the following letter from
Captain Amundsen	ORGANIZATION	on this matter -- and it seems only fair to him that some acknowledgement shoidd be made , as the error seems to be due entirely to the translator . ''

		The editor of The Athenaeum sends me
this morning	TIME	his journal of the
11th July	DATE	with a notice concerning my book , in which he tells me that I have been wrong in some names when I say that I passed ' through
Bellot Strait	LOCATION	. '

		I have now been looking to this , and find that there has been an error in the translation of my book , which please state as follows .

		In the original text , p. 44 , 1 say , in speaking about the
Bellot Strait	LOCATION	: ` Kl .

		8 om morgenen passerte vi saa straedet , ' which has been translated by you : ' At
8 A. M.	ORGANIZATION	we passed through the strait ; ' but ought to have been , ` At
8 A. M.	ORGANIZATION	we passed the strait , ' not through .

		It is a very bad mistake , which ought to be rectified as the difference is a very great one to everybody who studies the geography of the book . ''

		In justice to

		An Experiment in
Art Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		* That Professor Sir
Hubert von Herkomer	PERSON	, eminent artist and art teacher , and for nine years Slade Professor of the Fine Arts at
Oxford	LOCATION	, oc - cupying there the chair recently left vacant by
Ruskin	PERSON	, should have pronounced and original views on the subject of art education , is only what one would expect and desire .

		His book , '' My School and My Gospel , '' describing his twenty-one years ' experiment in art education at
Bushey	LOCATION	, is a sort of apologia pro arte sua , and , as such , is not wanting in that personal and distinctive element that seldom fails to impart interest and reality to the narrative in which it is present .

		It was in
1883	DATE	that the
Bushey	PERSON	school , des - tined to become rather famous in the world of art , opened its doors to some twenty-five pupils of both sexes , the only requirement for entrance being '' a head from life , drawn in charcoal , '' and the tuition fees being nothing whatever .

		The enterprise was purely a labor of love .

		Its author had '' made his career , '' as he expresses it , and he wished to put to a practical test certain pet theories of his own in art education .

		Under such conditions , the school was Professor
Herkomer	PERSON	, and Professor
Herkomer	PERSON	was the school .

		Of the first beginnings he writes : '' We were making a school under conditions never perhaps before attempted -- a school of art in a village .

		It was all an experiment , and no master in the world could have made it a success without the full-hearted and enthusiastic co-operation of the students .

		It was my good fortune to have the right material at the be - ginning , which was all-important for such a novel undertaking .

		An art atmosphere had to be created , and nobody , who has not tried to make a special atmo - sphere of this kind , can know what the task entails . ''

		The effect of the school on the sleepy little village was interesting : the atmosphere created by master and pupils seems to have pervaded the primitive hamlet , to some extent , and to have caused a desire in those breathing it for some of the refinements and luxuries of modern life which they had hardly given a thought to before .

		A few words now on the peculiar doc - trine taught at
Bushey	LOCATION	.

		The author tells an anecdote of a famous painter who , every day , before putting brush to canvas , knelt down and prayed fervently to be protected from his model .

		In much the same way the
Bushey	PERSON	art students seem to have been taught to pray for protection • My School and My Gospel .

		from their master .

		The personality of each pupil , his idiosyncrasy even , the distinctive quality of his work , was what the teacher tried to reach and develop . ''

		The result of this method of teaching has been that the world can not recognise my pupils in their works , and it will probably be said that I left no ' school ' behind me .

		But I never could understand the advantage of squeezing the supple mind of a young painter into a master 's manner , from which he may never wholly extri - cate himself .

		It was the word ' quality ' that most puz - zled and baffled the students ; the weaker thought it was something / wanted , and did not realize that it was an essential part of good art .

		The word was on every lip ; it was heard in the street of sleepy
Bushey	PERSON	; it was heard in the social gatherings of the students ; it was the last thought of the student when he went to bed , and the first when he got up .

		This question of quality certainly was the most difficult thing to get them to understand .

		How thankful I was when at last I could point to a particular part in a study that had attained the desired quality ; and how bitterly disappointed I felt when I saw it slip away again , sometimes to return no more . ''

		Elsewhere in the book he says : `` I made the very foundation of my teaching ' the awakening in the student of the sensitiveness to painter-like qualities , ' and the discovery of individual bent .

		By this method it was interesting to note how every successful student produced a different kind of quality and brush work , clearly proving that the insistence on that phase in the technique in no way interfered with the development of his own personal idiosyncrasy . ''

		In this teacher 's system , care was taken that theory should follow and not precede practice . ''

		The student must ' build up , ' as it were , on himself first ; he must make some edifice in which to house the wider and immovable principles that underlie aU mon - umental art .

		No master can be the builder of that edifice . ''

		It was another marked feature of Professor
Herkomer	PERSON	's system to give personal advice and assistance to his pupils after they left his school and launched out for themselves .

		Their emancipation , wisely or not , was made gradual .

		They took studios in the village , under the master 's eye , and were encouraged to consult him freely .

		Thus the abruptness of passage from the life class to the painting of portraits professionally , or the execution of other inde - pendent work , was modified for them , greatly to their advantage if we may credit their teacher .

		The discontinuance of Professor
Herkomer	PERSON	's teaching , after twenty-one years of signal suc - cess , and the closing of the
Bushey	PERSON	school prob - ably forever , were due to something like an accident -- some legal difficulty concerning build - ings and grounds .

		On such slight events do the destinies of empires and of art schools depend .

		But those were crowded years of glorious life for 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, the founder and head of the school .

		What he tells us incidentally of the by-products of his own and his pupils ' industry -- the mezzotint engraving , the music-composing , the play-writing and play - acting and scene-painting , the school-magazine writing and editing , and other pursuits congenial to artists -- makes it plain that a full and busy and sanely enjoyable life was lived at
Bushey	LOCATION	in those days .

		Considerable space and a number of illustrations are devoted to the highly success - ful and somewhat famous dramatic performances given in the master 's private theatre at
Bushey	PERSON	and attended by celebrities from the great world outside -- all , of course , untainted by the slight - est suggestion of commercialism or professional - ism or of anything but the pure love of art .

		An excellent story is told of an outsider 's attempt to turn to personal profit a charity performance of the Herkomer company by buying up aU the tickets in advance and advertising them for sale at double the price paid .

		But the artist theatre - manager turned the tables on the speculator by immediately advertising two additional charily performances of the same play , with tickets at the old price .

		The mortifying and pecuniarily dis - astrous result to the speculator can be imagined .

		Of this portion of his life , when manifold interests and occupations were crowding every waking hour and not a few that should have been given to sleep , the author , who confesses himself to have been ever a glutton for work , says : '' This was the period of my life when the work I imposed upon myself was so excessive that even greed could ask for no more .

		I worked at my portraits and subject-pictures , and I did etching as usual , con - sidering these to be my first duty .

		But to this all - sufficient labour must be added the designing of details for my house , which was in course of erection ; the preparation of lectures for
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, where I held the Slade Professorship ; the uninterrupted attendance at my school ; the building-up of a stage-picture for the play ; the writing of music for the same ; the irritating work of correcting the copied parts for the orchestra ; and , finally , the most severe strain of all on the nerves -- the rehearsing of a new play .

		I leave it to the reader to judge if this was a normal state of things .

		Yet dur - ing these months of excitement I was in good health , and retired to bed long after
midnight	TIME	without any feeling of fatigue .

		I had no assistance from stimulants , as I was a water-drmker and a non-smoker .

		But it was the result of the domination of mind over body for the time being -- a condition , however , that could not last .

		Nor did it ; for I have since paid the price for that pleasure - period in long years of bad health . ''

		In the course of his narrative the author takes occasion to illustrate his theory of personality in art by an apt quotation from
Mark Twain	PERSON	. ''

		But methods of work are as various as are the temperaments of human beings .

		The mystery of tem - perament -- or call it a ' person 's nature ' -- is interpreted by that master ,
Mark Twain	PERSON	, thus : `` Through all this steady drift of evolution the essential detail , the com - manding detail , the master detail of the make-up re - mains as it was in the beginning , suffers no change and can suffer none ; the basis of the character , the temper - ament , the disposition , that indestructible iron frame - work upon which the character is built , and whose shape it must take , and keep throughout life .

		We call it a person 's nature . ' ''

		The rich and varied experience of the author , who was , with his other tastes and gifts , some - thing of a psychologist , gives meaning and value to the following reflection : '' In my readings of psycho-physiological works , I have not yet found an explanation of that mysterious cerebral condition , when a man suddenly feels he is ripe for a certain mental action .

		A stray word from another person may effect the ignition in the brain , and cause all the faculties required for that mental action to spring into life .

		It was ever so with me .

		A word from a col - league started my etching period ; a word pointed to , and set me on to , enamelling ; a word -LRB- and that from my eldest son , when he was only a
Harrow	LOCATION	boy -RRB- proclaimed the moment for the theatrical venture ; even this book is the outcome of a word from a literary friend . ''

		And the '' literary friend '' deserves our thanks .

		The story is told in a clear , rapid style , enlivened by frequent touches of humor , and , with all its fine and high idealism , exhibit - ing a keen , practical common sense and a know - ledge of the world and its human inhabitants that not all devotees of art are noted for possess - ing .

		There is something , too , of the sixteenth - century Italian craftsman 's resource and ver - satility in Sir
Hubert von Herkomer	PERSON	.

		Born in
Florence	LOCATION	three centuries earlier , he might have been a second
Benvenuto Cellini	PERSON	.

		He has cer - tainly proved his ability to write an autobio - graphic narrative not less interesting in its way than
CeUini 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations , mostly by the author or his pupils , are many and full of char - acter .

		The volume is handsome , even luxurious , in its style .

		The Re-vs ^ riting of
American History	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It sometimes happens that a historical writer lives to find that his efforts have influenced the general view of the period or person about whom he writes ; but not so frequently does an author announce his intention of reconstructing public opinion about a period of history so hackneyed as is the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		In two volumes .

		THE DIAL .

		Ill accepted opinions in his various '' true '' con - tributions to American history , now devotes himself to the task of amending all existing his - tories of the Revolution , which are '' able theat - rical efforts , enlarged Fourth of
July	DATE	orations , or pleasing literary essays on selected phases of the contest . ''

		Assuming that '' no complete history of it -LSB- the struggle for Independence -RSB- has ever been written upon the plan of dealing frankly with all the contemporary evidence and withholding nothing of importance that is found in the original records , '' and that some of the most important factors in the struggle '' have always been left to persons who were unable or unwil - ling to reveal them , '' the author proceeds to lift the veil upon the hitherto obscure position of the Loyalists and their conflict with the Patriots , the war made by the latter upon the former , the controversy caused by
Howe	PERSON	's manner of carrying out his instructions , and the
Clinton	PERSON	- Corn wallis controversy .

		He also finds no intelligent history of the various Navigation acts , the Smuggling acts , and the Writs of Assistance , -- whether the writs ceased after American resistance , or were continued in the other colonies .

		The effect of the revolt on British colonial policy he finds in - adequately treated , as also the lessons learned by the mother country .

		The Tory party has hitherto been pictured as an angel of darkness , and the Whig as an angel of light .

		No historian has described the twelve or thirteen acts which the colonists wished repealed , the conciliatory measures advanced by
Britain	LOCATION	, and her '' gentle and mild efforts '' to persuade the Americans to remain in the empire .

		While ''
Bancroft	PERSON	's labo - rious pages and
Hildreth	PERSON	's colorless chronicle '' are illuminated by '' a very few citations , and these rather unimportant , ''
Fiske	PERSON	's `` beautifully written '' books are devoid of these aids to the reader in weighing the evidence submitted .

		Ar - raigning existing histories of the Revolution as '' written for profit , ignoring the sources , with - holding evidence , '' and ignoring the fact that the revolt was the result of a '' long uncertain strug - gle between the two opposing forces of colonial empire and separate independence '' still existent , the author defines his '' true '' historical series , of which this volume is to be a part , as an effort to lead the reader back to the documentary
CAa	ORGANIZATION	- dence which constitutes the truth , so that the rising generation may learn to admire truth more than popular and clever generalizations .

		Agreeable to these claims and this announce - ment , the reader naturally looks in Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's pages for much new evidence , and expects to see many new sources there revealed .

		In this , however , he is likely to be disappointed .

		A glance through the footnotes shows constant repetition of use of the
American Archives	ORGANIZATION	, the Annual Register , and the Journal of the Con - tinental
Congress	ORGANIZATION	; of the works of
Hutchinson	PERSON	,
Niles	PERSON	,
Stedman	PERSON	,
Elliot	PERSON	,
Jones	PERSON	,
Drake	PERSON	, and the plagiaristic
Gordon	PERSON	; and also the writings of
Washington	LOCATION	, the Adamses ,
Reed	ORGANIZATION	, and others -- sources used by every writer upon the period .

		Apparently the novelty of sources must lie in the contemporary pamphlets , which have been freely consulted and often with excellent effect .

		Notwithstanding the avowed intention of the author to revise accepted history , the reader finds that in but few instances is there a depart - ure from accepted opinions .

		Even the varia - tions are statements of the view of the author rather than the discovery of some hitherto unused authority .

		To illustrate : instead of treating the
Boston Tea Party	ORGANIZATION	as a spontaneous outbreak of some turbulent young-bloods of the lower social class , or a desperate effort on the part of the patriot leaders to prevent the tea being landed and confiscated at the expiration of twenty days , the author pronounces it a delib - erate attempt of the radicals of
Boston	LOCATION	, incited by messages from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-LRB- ! -RRB-

		, to precipi - tate '' an outbreak which would commit the party all over the country to a more violent and radical position . ''

		The narrative opens with a description of the Navigation acts , prefaced by a chapter on the growth of free thought and movement after the Reformation , and closes with the disbanding of the American forces after the Revolutionary War .

		An added chapter discusses one of the points claimed to have been omitted by prior writers .

		In it the author finds that
England	LOCATION	retrieved commercially the loss of the thirteen American colonies by the conquest of rich
India	LOCATION	, but that she has not in the further ex - tension of her colonial system ameliorated the conditions which caused the American colonies to revolt .

		All her colonists are still '' political slaves . ''

		Descriptions of campaigns fill most of the two volumes , discovering little in novelty of state - ment or setting , but giving more than the accustomed space to incidents of the by - wars of
England	LOCATION	with
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	.

		Balance and proportion are well preserved , except where local interest is permitted to pre - dominate , as in giving an entire chapter to the mediaeval tourney held by the British officers in 113 THE DIAL .

Sept. 1	DATE	, Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's book is an attempt to interpret the genius of the Spanish people , as it is re - vealed in history , in religion , in literature , and in daily life .

		There is no descriptive writing , no record of personal experience , no discussion of political , industrial , or commercial conditions , but a thoughtful analysis of the '' essential
Spain	LOCATION	, '' which , he says , -- `` Represents the supreme manifestation of a certain primitive and eternal attitude of the human spirit , an attitude of heroic energy , of spiritual exaltation , directed not chiefly toward comfort or gain , but toward the more fundamental facts of human existence . ''

		There is perhaps little that is new in the book , yet the discussion , being philosophical and sug - gestive , forms interesting reading .

		The follow - ing sentence illustrates the general content as well as the style of composition . ''

		The people of
Spain	LOCATION	-- still sound at the core , and with a vigour of spirit which has enabled them to win strength even out of defeat -- showed at one period at least in their history , from the conquest of
Toledo	LOCATION	to the conquest of
Seville	LOCATION	, an incomparable strength , free - dom , and vitality ; even later ,
Spain	LOCATION	still had the energy to find and to colonise the other hemisphere of the globe ; and later still , to bring spiritual achievements of im - mortal value to the treasure-house of humanity ; while the forceful and plastic genius of
Spain	LOCATION	has moulded one of the strongest and most beautiful forms of human speech and one of the most widely diffused . ''

		Throughout his study of Spanish traits and temperament , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	finds much African influence .

		He sees everywhere the underlying characteristics of the primitive savage -- the word to be used in its larger sense .

		Thus , the simplicity , intensity of feeling , and love of idle - ness of the Spaniard , coupled with his aptitude for violent action , his austerity , his stoicism , his indifference to pain , as well as his delight in form and ceremony , are all manifestations of the aboriginal spirit .

		A general survey of Spanish life to-day and in the past shows that the ideals of valor and of heroism , the point of honor , the pride of the beggar , ceremonialism , mili - tarianism , the Inquisition , the bull-fight , the Dominican order , the Cid ,
Loyola	LOCATION	,
Cervantes	PERSON	, -- indeed , nearly every characteristic usually sup - posed to be Spanish , as well as the principal institutions and personages of
Spain	LOCATION	, have their fountain-head in the elemental aborigine .

		Whether this is our old friend Probably Ar - boreal , or not , is unstated .

		The Spanish woman receives kindly treat - ment in Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's hands .

		He studies her ana - tomically and otherwise with painstaking care .

		Full consideration is given to the pigmentation of her eye , the texture of her skin , her hair , hands , feet , bust , and hips , without omitting the length of her skull or the peculiar curve of her spine .

		Her dash of eastern blood is responsible for the calm steadiness of her eye , as well as for the muscular control of her face which renders it a living shield .

		And this explains what has always been a mystery to us of northern race , her seeming composure under the blazing mirada or '' long gaze '' of the courteous Spaniard .

		The Spanish woman has reached high eminence in literature , in war , in movements for social reform , and even in the bull-ring .

		She may be unable , it is true , to read or to write . ''

		But there is perhaps no European country where one realizes so clearly how little this really means .

		A Spanish woman of the people , who finds it a laborious task to write her own name , may yet show the finest tact and knowledge in all the essential matters of living . ''

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	finds the women of present-day
Spain	LOCATION	superior to the men , both physically and intellectually .

		Far be it from the reviewer to take issue with this conclusion , yet he can not quite follow the author 's reasoning when he accounts for this phenomenon by the sad deple - tion of Spanish manhood through wars , the Inquisition , and emigration to the New World . ''

		We might explain the fine qualities of Spanish women to-day by supposing that , while the stocks that especially tend to produce fine men have been largely killed out , the stocks that tend to produce fine women have not been subjected to this process . ''

		Just what kind of stock it is that produces fine women while leaving their brothers weak , the author does not say .

		Looking at the country as a whole , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	notes remarkable progress in cities and towns during the
last two decades	DATE	.


Spain	LOCATION	even stands ahead of most European states in the application of electricity .

		Discontent with the old order and zeal for the new have resulted , however , in the loss of many picturesque features which heretofore have constituted
Spain	LOCATION	's charm for the foreign visitor .

		There is no complaint at the betterment of hotels , the improvements in sanitation , or the increased facilities for travel ; but there is genuine regret at seeing fine old churches used as convenient attachments for electric wires , and the talking-machine , or cinematograph , replacing the guitar and the malaguena .

		That there is also a certain moral awaken - ing in
Spain	LOCATION	is shown by the recent movement to eliminate the most objectionable features of the buU-fighfc .

		This has been approved by prominent espadas -- Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	caUs them '' toreadors . ''

		It may surprise Americans to read that our war with
Spain	LOCATION	and her consequent disburden -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 116 ment of
Cuba	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	are the cause of much of her later development .

		In the author 's words : '' The war has been beneficial -LSB- to
Spain	LOCATION	-RSB- in at least two different ways .

		It has had a healthy economical influence , because , besides directing the manhood of
Spain	LOCATION	into sober industrial channels , it has led to the removal of artificial restrictions in the path of com - mercial activity .

		It has been advantageous morally , because it has forced even the most narrow and ignorant Spaniard to face the actual facts of the modern world . ''

		The Introduction to '' The Soul of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' together with the chapters on '' The Spanish People , '' '' The Women of
Spain	LOCATION	, '' and '' Spanish Ideals of To-day , '' contain all the matter that properly falls under the title of the book .

		The chapters treating of
Seville	LOCATION	,
Don Quixote	PERSON	,
Valera	LOCATION	,
Ramon Lull	PERSON	, and other disconnected subjects , are evident padding .

		Much of the matter has appeared previously in reviews and magazines .

		While Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's book is useful for the library , Mr.
Lomas	PERSON	's , as its title '' In
Spain	LOCATION	'' might imply , is serviceable on the spot .

		With true English assurance , the author expresses the belief that the traveller '' may take it in his hand as his sole guide and counsellor , and find in it all the information , other than that of local and ever - varying character , which he will need in his journeyings . ''

		The work is , indeed , a revised , re-written , and enlarged edition of the author 's '' Sketches in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' published in
1884	DATE	.

		It is a fine book mechanically , containing a good fold - ing map and fifty excellent mostly new full-page photographs .

		The showy red cover is stamped with the arms of
Spain	LOCATION	in Spanish yellow .

		The style of writing is uninspired , to say the least ; while the great mass of detailed informa - tion , the result of careful observation and con - scientious record , produces a guide-book effect which is not attractive to the general reader .

		It is really a guide-book -- a sort of
Baedeker	LOCATION	, with light clothes covering the dry bones of that pro- saic but useful work .

		Mr.
Lomas	PERSON	tells us the proper train to take , where to obtain the best view , what to visit , and when .

		He names the pictures , describes the chapels , altars , pulpits , and tombs , and points out which window to study .

		To many there will seem to be an overweight of ecclesiastical architecture ; for if the churches were omitted , the book would probably be re - duced a third in size .

		Although the principal Spanish paintings are designated , the criticism of them is too general and too fragmentary to be valuable or satisfying .

		The chapters are arranged in the form of an itinerary , beginning at
Irun	LOCATION	, proceeding south - ward by way of Burgos ,
Valladolid	LOCATION	, and Sala - manca , to
Madrid	LOCATION	, thence through the cities of
Andalucia	LOCATION	to
Gibraltar	LOCATION	, and back by
Granada	LOCATION	and the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coast to
Barcelona	LOCATION	.

		Northern
Spain	LOCATION	is then crossed , visiting the principal towns to
Vigo	ORGANIZATION	, where the trip ends .

		This tour occupies about six months , starting at the close of
October	DATE	, wandering through the south in the winter months , taking the
Mediter	PERSON	- ranean in early
spring	DATE	, and sailing away before hot weather begins .

		It is a long trip , yet not a leisurely one .

		Let no man imagine , if he goes with Mr.
Lomas	PERSON	, that he is to sit at little cafe , tables and watch the life drift lazily by .

		Every day is a busy day , although perhaps hot a hard one .

		The traditional hardships of Spanish travel are thus dismissed : '' Every needful comfort , and , indeed , not a little luxury and up-to-date fruits of science , will be met with ; and if , here and there , something be lacking , there will be shown such an amount of goodwill and helpfulness , such honesty and laborious striving to make up for de - fects , that the want will call only for a laugh . ''

		Like most writers on
Spain	LOCATION	, Mr.
Lomas	PERSON	has not been able to refrain from depicting a bull - fight , although he is mercifully brief , remember - ing possibly that we have heard it all many times before .

		We find nothing new in his ac - count except the novel statements that chulos carry '' red flags , '' and that the matador uses a '' short Toledo blade . ''

		In common with Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	, the author per - ceives a great advancement in
Spain	LOCATION	during the last twenty-five years .

		He says : '' It has become possible to pass and to uphold laws ensuring security of life and property .

		The almost un - unrivalled natural resources of the country are being rapidly developed ; liberal institutions are being set on foot ; the national indebtedness has shrunk into manage - able proportions , and the foreign creditor is content .

		Notable efforts are being made to free the land from the tyranny of priestcraft . ''

		Both of these volumes are substantial addi - tions to our rapidly growing stock of books descriptive of this interesting country . ''

		The Soul of
Spain	LOCATION	'' will be enjoyed at home by the man who is interested in the history and psy - chology of nations , even though he may not subscribe to the savage or superiority-of - woman theories . ''

		In
Spain	LOCATION	'' will be most helpful to the traveller , and more especially to the anti- quarian or the ecclesiologist .

		Neither book has any special message for the idle or purposeless traveller .

		Not much consideration can be shown the '' nimble tourist '' by men who devote a week to
Toledo	LOCATION	.


George Griffin Brownell	PERSON	.

		116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, The DEVEiiOPMBNT OF English Tragedy .

		* In tracing the course and development of English tragedy , Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	first ex - plains the meaning and scope of the term , and of the two principal ideas -- the Senecan and the Mediasval -- which enter into it .

		He then shows how these two elements fused in early English tragedy , and how the resultant English form developed and reached its height in the hands of
Marlowe	PERSON	and Shakespeare ; how the evolution proceeded , under the less wholesome conditions of English life in the times of
James I.	PERSON	and
Charles I.	PERSON	, in the work of the later Elizabethans and especially
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	; how this somewhat hectic and unwholesome English literary tradition , as it existed at the closing of the theatres in
1642	DATE	, was carried on at the Restoration ; how French pseudo-classic influence steadily worked upon this English tradition for a century , -- the con - flict between pure English tragical tradition and the pseudo-classic being shown in the work of
Dryden	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee	PERSON	, and others , -- until out of the two was established a highly conventionalized stereotyped form which was the recognized legitimate tragedy of the eighteenth century , and extended over into the nineteenth .

		He points out the elements of revolt from this con - ventionalized type in Lillo 's ''
George Barnwell	PERSON	'' and in the practise of the writers of the romantic movement so far as they turned to tragedy .

		But these elements of revolt came to naught , and this history of the tragic type comes to an end with the retirement of
Macready	PERSON	from the manage - ment of
Drury Lane	ORGANIZATION	in
1843	DATE	.

		Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	is quite right in attri - buting to the theatrical conditions of the time much of the responsibility for the failure of the great poetical romantic movement of 1790-1832 to produce tragedy .

		The two patent theatres which alone had the right to produce tragedies were overstocked with older plays , and in gen - eral were moribund .

		Opportunity and incen - tive for the great poets to learn the jieeds of the theatre , and to adapt their conceptions to the requirements of actual performance , were lack - ing .

		The poets wrote dramas which , however brilliant in composition , were not actable , and thus arose a closet drama of great literary merit .

		To the lover of true drama , these closet dramas are a sad memorial of what might have been .

		• Tragedy .

		By
Ashley H. Thorndike	PERSON	, Professor of English in
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One can not but think that some of these men could have met both demands -- could have written plays which were good for the stage and good as literature ; and thus the long con - tinued separation between literature and the stage might have been avoided .

		Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	's book is the third to appear in Professor
Neilson	PERSON	's series of histories of English literature by types , following '' The Popular Ballad '' by Prof.
F. B. Gummere	PERSON	and '' The Literature of Roguery '' by Mr.
F. W. Chandler	PERSON	.

		One may have some doubts as to the practicability of treating all English literature on this plan , but Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	has demon - strated that tragedy may be so treated to advan - tage .

		He has traced the development of tragedy skilfully , and has held firmly to the idea of its evolution as a species .

		Except , perhaps , for the chapter of fifteen pages on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, he has not deviated from his purpose .

		The species is his interest , not the individual ; and , with the single exception noted above , individuals are treated as stages of the developing species , not in a series of individual essays as in Ward 's '' English Dramatic Literature . ''

		The interest of the book consists in its han - dling of familiar matter from this unifying point of view , rather than in its contribution of new facts to scholarship ; although it is but fair to say that Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	has had to work almost from the ground up in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , and that his book is dis - tinctly a contribution to our knowledge of this period .

		On the whole , he is to be congratulated on the accomplishment of a piece of sound scholarly work .

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117
Robertson	PERSON	and Miss
Emma Helen Blair	PERSON	.

		They have accomplished their task amid many un - toward circumstances .

		Not long after the first volumes of the series had appeared , in
1903	DATE	, it became apparent that there was not yet sufficient interest in the past of
the Philippines	LOCATION	to furnish the financial support necessary for a work of this magnitude .

		But the publishers , facing the loss , stood by the editors in the determination to carry out their undertaking .

		And the latter have kept at the task while for five years their only hope of reward lay in the recognition of work well done .

		Forced to a strict economy in the prose - cution of their enterprise , they have at the same time been obliged to enlarge their personal activ - ities as editors and producers of material , while also burdened with the drudgery of the merely clerical labors which such a work involves .

		Scholarly fidelity of this sort deserves mention ; and this is the excuse for a digression at the very beginning of this review .

		The series of which this Bibliography forms a part is not without its defective features , failures of omission chiefly ; it is doubtless not as good as its own editors could have made it with better support and more substantial encouragement .

		But it is neverthe - less a work of great significance and value -- the most important achievement in its field , and indispensable in any Philippine library or col - lection .

		This Bibliography is one more proof of the care and conscientiousness that have gone into the editing of the work as a whole ; and like - wise it gives evidence of the knowledge accu - mulated during the preparation of the preceding volumes .

		Passing over , for the moment , the discussion of its scope , it may be said that , within the limits which he outlined for himself , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's work is both thorough and accurate .

		Down to the special index of names which closes the volume , painstaking attention to detail is everywhere apparent .

		After stating the purposes and limitations of the volume , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	gives some fifty pages of usefully condensed information regarding the chief public and private collections of Philippine manuscripts and printed works in the world ; also regarding Philippine Imguistics , maps and cartography , photographs and views , museum collections , etc. .

		The collections of manuscripts in
Spain	LOCATION	occupy , of course , preferential import - ance of space ; and owing to the special value of the
Seville	LOCATION	archives for Philippine history , a dozen pages are taken up with the indexes of Philippine documents there preserved .

		Only lately .

		Professor
H. E. Bolton	PERSON	, investigating the national archives in
Mexico City	LOCATION	, turned up a lot of suspected but hitherto unlisted material on the
Philippines	LOCATION	; and the scope of that material is here indicated .

		The information as to the chief collections of
Philippina	LOCATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	is of direct practical value to any Amer - ican student who may take up serious work in this hitherto neglected field .

		Only a fourth of the bibliographical text pro- per is devoted to printed works .

		First comes a list of the major Philippine bibliographies , with some very practical and pertinent commentaries thereon , -- the list also including various minor works in Philippine bibliography and special bibliographical lists , even also notes of rectifica - tion in periodicals as well as pamphlets and books .

		There follows a list of other bibliog - raphies mostly general in their nature , under which the
Philippines	LOCATION	or some phase of them are treated ; also catalogues of public and pri - vate libraries and sales catalogues listing
Philip	LOCATION	- pina .

		This list , and the one following it , covering books and pamphlets on the
Philippines	LOCATION	which append bibliographies or contain bibliograph - ical data scattered through their text , possess a reference value quite imique , as the information is nowhere else available .

		The last and largest list of printed titles is the only one that falls under the head of
General Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is comprised almost entirely of printed books , pamphlets , etc. , which have been published in whole or in part in the preceding fifty-two vol - umes of `` The Philippine Islands , 1493-1898 , '' with the addition of some few very rare works which have not been drawn upon directly for that work .

		The special value of this list lies in the descriptions , location of copies so far as known , and other data regarding the rarer works on the
Philippines	LOCATION	.

		The bulk of the volume is devoted to manu - scripts .

		Here the first hundred pages are occupied with a chronological list of the manu - scripts published in whole or in part in the series of which this
Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	is a part .

		Very complete descriptions , especially of the more important of these manuscripts , are also afforded .

		In the second and larger list oi manuscripts , those not published in the series , descriptions are sometimes appended , and some - tiaies not .

		Some of these manuscripts have been cited from other
Philippine	LOCATION	bibliographers and authors , who have not always described or located them .

		The memoranda made in various archives for this work in many cases give only 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, the dates and a general idea of the character of the manuscripts that have not been transcribed .

		Moreover , the work was originally planned to cover Philippine history only up to
1800	DATE	, which is one reason for there being relatively fewer manuscripts of the nineteenth century .

		How - ever , the
Ayer Collection	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	and the manuscripts in the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, these latter relating mainly to
Guam	LOCATION	, have helped in part to fill the hiatus here ; and full descriptions are also given of manuscripts in these two libra - ries .

		Of course , one volume could not begin to hold a complete list of manuscripts about the
Philippines	LOCATION	; nor has the time come when any - one coidd make such a catalogue .

		Even the better-known collections of such manuscripts in the archives of
Spain	LOCATION	have not yet been thoroughly overhaided ; while the archives of
Manila	LOCATION	and those at
Mexico City	LOCATION	-- to mention two highly important soiu-ces for the future study of Philippine history -- remain as yet uncatalogued , and the latter scarcely examined .

		But this volume presents , as stated in the in - troduction , '' more manuscript Philippine titles than all other bibliographies together '' -- many more , in fact .

		Moreover , '' manuscripts are cited for almost each year of the Spanish regime ; and thus the manuscript division forms in itself almost an epitome of Philippine history . ''

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, then , has not undertaken to prepare a full comprehensive bibliography of
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Such a work could not be com - prised in any one octavo volume .

		This opening still exists , for none of the Philippine biblio - graphies previously published has fully covered the field , even of printed titles .

		Retana 's recent Aparato hihliogrdjico lists more titles than any other , and is usef id in many ways ; but the most practical working bibliography , especially for the American student , is that formed of the two lists of Mr.
A. P. C. Griffin	PERSON	-LRB- Library of Con - gress -RRB- and Mr.
T. H. Pardo de Tavera	PERSON	, both published in one volume by the
Bureau of Insular Affairs	ORGANIZATION	of the War Department at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		This work being readily avail - able , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's purpose has been , as regards printed PhUippina , to point out the sources for a complete study of Philippine bib - liography , while also setting forth the main data regarding rare works in this field ; and to list manuscripts in a way hitherto unattempted .

		This task , well performed , makes a work sui generis and indispensable for every library pre - tending to cover this field at all and for every special student therein .

		Why are we ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ t of all evil , in Dr.
George	PERSON	rtghthanded
M. Gould	PERSON	's philosophy , is eye-strain .

		or lefthanded f Qp ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ j ^ .

		jggg epigrammatically and more truthfully , the eye and its diseases are of more far-reaching significance than is commonly suspected .

		In Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's book on '' Righthanded - ness and Lefthandedness '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- the eminent oculist clearly , and for the first time so far as we know , shows the part played by the eye in deter - mining which shall be the dominant hand and foot .

		Historically , righthandedness begins with the choice of that hand to hold and throw the spear , and of the left to carry the shield and protect the vital organs , the position of the heart dictating this division of duties .

		Then , the right being the operating hand , the right eye is naturally called upon more than the left to watch and guide its motions , until , by the hereditary transmission of acquired peculiarities -LRB- in which the author declares himself a believer -RRB- , the right eye , and with it the right hand and foot and ear , acquire an almost invariable superiority over their mates .

		In the vaguely groping and sprawling infant it is the hereditarily dominant eye , says our oculistr author , that decides which hand and foot shall have the preference in action ; and with this instinctive choice comes also the beginning of that differentia - tion in the cerebral hemispheres which makes the sinistral '' the correlated centre for speech-phonation '' and also for speech-writing .

		The exceptions , the left-handed -- some six per cent of mankind -- are accounted for by the occasional enforced develop - ment of sinistro-expertness because of accident or disease ; and this peculiarity , though not commonly traceable from father to son , reappears sporadically in the race .

		Grievous is the wrong done to a left - handed child in trying to make him over into a right-handed one .

		The speech-centre has become located , the left eye has established its superiority , and nothing but confusion and eye-strain and all sorts of misery can result .

		The book 's eight chap - ters , two of which are reprinted from '' Biographic Clinics , '' and the others collected from medical and scientific journals , treat chiefly of writing and the writing-posture in relation to the eyes and to spinal curvature , with useful advice and information in other kindred matters .

		The author 's preliminary list of previous theories as to the origin of right - handedness omits the shield-and-spear explanation , as if it were here advanced for the first time , which of course it is not .

		The eye 's leading part in the fix - ing of righthandedness or lefthandedness is proved , in some sort at least , by embryology .

		It is a curious point -- upon which only Doctor
Johnson	PERSON	could make the adequate gibe -- that not only is a Shakespearean editor required to determine what plays may rightfully be attributed to the master , but in collecting the plays wrongfully attributed to Shakespeare the apocryphal editor must exercise a Plays which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	did not write .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 similar care and shut out of his volume those plays that have not often enough been wrongly attributed !

		Some two-score plays have had the dangerous honor of being assigned to Shakespeare ; but fourteen of these , in the editor 's opinion , may legitimately find place in '' The Shakespeare Apocrypha , '' a volume carefully put together by Mr.
C. F. Tucker Brooke	PERSON	, a
Rhodes Scholar	ORGANIZATION	who is at present
Senior Demy of Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	, and which is issued from the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's collection meets a defi - nite need .

		Many a student of Elizabethan drama , not to speak of many a reader of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, has often wished to have ready access to the pseudo - Shakespearean dramas , only a few of which , like the '' Two Noble Kinsmen , '' have been conveniently at hand .

		To have now in one volume not merely the often reprinted plays , but also -LRB- in seven instances -RRB- the first really careful modern reprint , and in one in - stance -LRB- '' Sir
John Oldcastle	PERSON	'' -RRB- the only reprint of the only right version , is a real boon .

		To name the con - tents is to give a sufficient comment on Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	's volume : Arden of
Feversham	LOCATION	,
Locrine	LOCATION	,
Edward III.	PERSON	, Mucedorus , Sir
John Oldcastle	PERSON	,
Thomas Lord Crom	PERSON	- well , The
London	LOCATION	Prodigal , The Puritan , A York - shire Tragedy , The Merry Devil of
Edmonton	LOCATION	, Fair Em , Two
Noble Kinsmen	PERSON	, The Birth of
Merlin	LOCATION	, Sir Thomas More .

		Of these plays Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	gives us a careful text in the old spelling , and adds a well - written fifty-page introduction and some notes .

		It is unfortunate that the notes are so scanty : herein the volume fails of being definitive .

		It is to be hoped that in a future edition the editor will add copiously to his annotations , and thus make hia book indis - pensable .

		When so much has been well done , it is a pity not to do the needful rest and make the work completely satisfying .

		Regarding the plays rejected , there is no need to quarrel with the editor 's taste : as in an anthology , both rejection and inclu - sion are extremely provocative of dissent in some quarter or another .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	has , at the very least , made a good choice of plays .

		The `` psychic Anyone who has perused
M. Flam	PERSON	- researches '' of marion 's writings upon procedures an astronomer , seemingly at variance with the recog - nized laws of nature will anticipate that there is nothing notable to be found in the more extended work lately appearing in English with the title `` Mysterious Psychic Forces '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is , indeed , a compilation , with re - cent additions , of a long record of seances with '' mediums '' of all sorts and conditions , whose chief occupation is that of moving tables and '' material - izing '' theatrical properties in a more or less baffling manner .

		Upon such narratives a rather extreme '' spiritualistic '' interpretation is elaborated .

		To one convinced of the soundness of this position , or one inclined to such belief , the collected data must be tremendously portentous .

		To one who expects that investigations emanating from a man with astronom - ical training would be marked by the qualities we should naturally look for from such a source -- exactness of conditions , laborious accumulation of evidence , expertness in detecting sources of error , and caution in conclusions -- the record will be equally disappointing .

		The author assumes at the outset of his studies a definiteness of attitude and confidence of elimination of sources of error which he would not assume at the close of a long astro - nomical research .

		M. Flammarion is , indeed , the conspicuous example of a man of science utterly con - fused , even dazed , by the overpowering dominance of '' facts '' ; quite ilnmindful that the type of '' fact '' that thus staggers his reason but reflects the manner of his predilections .

		Had he really described facts , the record would have been brief : '' In the presence of such and such a medium , I have apparently observed such and such behavior of inanimate ob - jects .

		I did not succeed in discovering how the effect was produced . ''

		Just what the interest or the interpretation of the alleged phenomena may prove to be , when their modus operandi is frankly con - fessed , is still left to uncertainty .

		With no apologies or acknowledg - ` t ^ i ^ Zfrltsts .

		`` ^ e '' t `` to Old
Roger Ascham	PERSON	, m.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	has en - titled his latest book `` The Schoolmaster '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		However , he has scarcely anything to say on the subject of classical education , his pleasantly informal chapters having to do with the general relations be - tween masters and pupils and between the master and his colleagues , with brief dissertations on such subjects as holidays , sociability , religion , moralities , intellect , originality , praise , discipline , devotion , and a few more of like sort ; and so it need not be feared that he has stolen any of the excellent
Ascham	ORGANIZATION	's thunder .

		The book is announced as a companion volume to the author 's ''
Upton Letters	PERSON	, '' and it serves as an acceptable sequel and complement to that thoughtful and stimulating work .

		It has also some - thing more of definiteness and reality and terseness than that series of imaginary letters , admirable and '' convincing '' though those letters are .

		As a sample of the later book 's quality , let us quote a few lines that might well be pondered , not only by school - masters , but also by others , perhaps by book-reviewers .

		`` One form of affectation has , I believe , very bad results .

		It is the custom of many teachers to speak as if all the authors whom they were expounding were equally valuable .

		I do not think that anything destroys the critical and appreciative faculties in boys so quickly as this .

		I believe myself that it is good for a teacher to have strong prejudices , just as Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	's feeling for Livy partook , as his pupils said , of an almost personal animosity . ''

		The writer takes occasion to deplore the present excessive devotion to athletics in school and university , a protest rendered the more effective from his own record as a football - player .

		Like many who write much and easily , Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has his mannerisms , among which one can - not but note his fondness for the word `` apt '' to denote customary action , a usage of questionable cor - rectness , but pardonable if not carried to excess .

		120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, , ^ , , In the middle ages , and long before , About peacocks , j i flowers , aardens , the peacock was regarded as a sym - and other things , bol of eternity , of immortality .

		Thus we are informed in the preface to '' The Peacock 's Pleasaunce '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- -- a collection of graceful , al - most poetical , essays on themes chiefly rural , and having to do largely with birds and gardens and flowers , and also weeds , while two addresses on art education complete the volume .

		The book is by `` E. V. B. '' -LRB- in quotation marks -RRB- , who is apparently a woman , and one of fine sensibilities , mystical in her moods and given to symbolism in their literary expression .

		In the semi-suggestions of the super - natural that sprinkle her pages , as well as in the veil of mysticism thrown over all , there is something almost Hawthornesque -- a nameless charm that makes one forgive the '' fine writing '' in which the author is prone to indulge .

		Let us quote one short passage which , with many others , falls on the ear with more than a faint reminder of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		The Professor 's daughter has seen a startlingly strange insect , and the Professor says : '' ' Call me should the thing reenter the house .

		I will immediately come , and will straightway bottle him ; or I will con - strain him weightily between the leaves , within the covers of one of my biggest books .

		* Having thus spoken , the Professor retreated into his study , shut - ting out the whole of the outside world , immersed , as was his wont , for hours in the old , strange world of books -- - for him more familiar , more illimitable than the other . ''

		Seven photo-prints of handsome pea - cocks , and a fanciful frontispiece also containing peacocks , appropriately illustrate the book .

		.

		Mr.
Horace Bleackley	PERSON	's '' Story of a a famous Beautiful Duchess '' -LRB- Button -RRB- proves Irish beauty .

		^ o be a biography of Elizabeth Gun - ning , a famous Irish beauty who became successively
Duchess of Hamilton	ORGANIZATION	and of
Argyll	ORGANIZATION	, served as one of Queen
Charlotte	LOCATION	's ladies of the bedchamber , and was otherwise a person of much social distinction .

		The book presents a very attractive appearance ; the binding , presswork , and illustrations do ample justice to the elegance of the theme .

		The story is enter - taining and easily read ; it might be objected that the author has included a needless amount of petty scandal , but it is hard to give a truthful picture of English society in the eighteenth century without including a certain amount of such material .

		Still , after completing the book the reader is likely to ask if the author 's efforts have really been worth while .

		No doubt the Duchess was as good and womanly as she was beautiful , but she scarcely requires a biog - raphy of nearly four hundred pages , which , while it adds much to our knowledge of the Duchess , adds little to that of her country and age .

		Aside from a tendency to idealize his subject , the author appears to possess the qualities of a good historian , which might have shown to better advantage in a larger field .

		Some charming portraits of the Duchess , and of other notables of her day , add materially to the attractiveness of the volume .

		The text is in both Russian and English .

		Mr.

		Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	's `` The Standard Concert Guide '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is a condensation of the three vol - umes devoted respectively to oratorios , cantatas , and symphonies , that have long been in favor with concert - goers .

		Enough new matter has been added to bring the work down to date , and some sixty portraits of composers embellish the volume .

		We are glad to note , as a sign of returnmg pros - perity in the book trade , that the
New York	LOCATION	branch of the old established house of
Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which of late years has existed chiefly as an agency of the
London	LOCATION	house , intends to enter actively into the business of book publishing again .

		Mr.

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		These biographies , over thirty in number , are each from ten to twenty pages in length , and give only essential facts , with little or no attempt at literary characterization .

		It is difficult to account for some of the omissions , but the work as we have it is well done , and students of English literature will find it useful .


L. Mylius Erichsen	PERSON	, the Danish explorer , who met his death in a snowstorm while travelling over the ice on the northeastern coast of
Greenland	LOCATION	, as told in a cable - gram from
Copenhagen	LOCATION	a few days ago , was better known to his countrymen as an author and poet than as an explorer .

		His best known works are '' Tatere '' -LRB- Gypsies -RRB- , a play ; `` Vestjyder '' -LRB- West-Jutlanders -RRB- , a book of short stories ; '' Strandingshistorier '' -LRB- Stories of Shipwrecks -RRB- , another book of short stories ; '' Isglimt '' -LRB- Ice Gleams -RRB- , a book of poems ; `` Den jyske Hede '' -LRB- The
Jutlandish Heath	PERSON	-RRB- , a most thorough description of that part of
Denmark	LOCATION	; ''
Greenland	LOCATION	, '' a record of his former explorations in that frozen country .

Erich	PERSON	- sen also had the distinction of being the first Danish poet to make a serious and intelligent effort to describe the actual conditions of the neglected fishermen on the west coast of
Jutland	LOCATION	, and to point out a practical way of bettering their condition .

		Mr.
Erichsen	PERSON	was only in his thirty-sixth year at the time of his death .

		THE STUDY OF STELLAR EVOLUTION An Account of Some
Modern Methods of Astrophysical Research	ORGANIZATION	, by GEORGE
ELLERY HALE	PERSON	.

		The introduction of photographic methods , the improvement of telescopes , and the rapidly increasing appreciation of the value to astronomy of physical instruments and processes , have revolutionized the observatory .

		From a simple observing station it has been transformed into a great physical laboratory , where images of the sun and stars are studied with many powerful instruments , and celestial phenomena are experimentally imitated with the aid of electric furnaces and other sources of intense heat .

		The result has been a great gain in our knowledge of the origin , development , and decay of stars .

		This book explains in a popular way how the life histories of the sun and stars are investigated .

		One hundred and four half-tone plates , made from the best astronomical negatives , place before the reader the most recent results of celestial photography in most of its phases .

		NOTES 170 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS ... 171 -LRB- A classified list of books announced for publica - tion during the coming Fall and
Winter	DATE	season . -RRB-

		BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		The classified list of publishers ' announce - ments , which occupies many pages of our present issue , is of rich and varied interest .

		It seems to us to include an unusually large number of attrac - tive titles -- titles of the sort that whet the liter - ary appetite with the foretaste of happy hours in the easy-chair .

		In accordance with our custom , we select for note in the present article a few such announcements as seem to promise particular enjoyment .

		Only the categories of biography , history , and general literature are here touched upon , which means , of course , that those readers who find their chief account in the literature of travel , or of philosophy , or of education , or of science or art , are referred to the list itself for their special delectation .

		The list as a whole assuredly gives evidence that our publishers look forward to a prosperous season , and that the commercial depression of last year is becoming to them an old , unhappy , far-off thing .

		The category of biography is the richest in this year 's list .

		Perhaps the book of first im - portance is the life of George
William Curtis	PERSON	, to which
Henry Loomis Nelson	ORGANIZATION	gave the best energies of the last years of his life .

		This book offers an ideal relation between author and subject .

		Mr.
Nelson	PERSON	was not only
Curtis	PERSON	's suc - cessor in the editorial chair , but he was also a man inspired by the same lofty ideals of political life and the duty of the citizen .

		From such a writer we may expect a life of Curtis that shall be characterized by both sympathy and distinc - tion .

		Mr.
H. W. Whitney	PERSON	is the author of a new life of Lincoln which is to be a work of considerable dimensions .

		Many other biogra - phies of American public men are promised , but we must leave them unmentioned .

		In liter - ary biography , Mr.
Ferris Greenslet	PERSON	is to give us the official life of
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, based largely upon the letters of the poet .

		No definite promise is thus far given us of a biog - raphy of our other lost poet ,
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	, but his literary executors are hard at work upon it , and it may possibly be looked for next year . ''

		The Family Letters of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, '' edited by her brother , are promised ; and a volume on
William Morris	PERSON	, to be pre - 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, pared by a brother poet , Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, for the '' English Men of Letters '' series .

		A group of biographical works of extra - ordinary interest relates to the world of art , music , and the drama .

		The authorized biog - raphy of
Whistler	LOCATION	is to be the work of Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	, prepared upon lines laid down by
Whistler	LOCATION	himself , and richly illustrated .

		Mr.
Will H. Low	PERSON	, in '' A Chronicle of Friendships , '' is to give us his personal reminiscences of such men as Millet and
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		The `` Musical Memories '' of Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	, that veteran critic and friend of musicians , will cover a full half - century of intimate relations with musicians of the past , from
Adelina Patti	LOCATION	to
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	.

		It is sure to be replete with interest of the deepest kind .

		We are also to have a translation of
Angelo Neumann	PERSON	's ''
Reminiscen	PERSON	- cences of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, '' one of the most important of recent contributions to the life - history of the great composer .

		The two great actors who have recently died are to be the sub - jects of official memoirs .

		Mr.
Austin Brereton	PERSON	is the biographer of
Henry Irving	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Paul Wilstach	PERSON	of
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	.

		Both are to be large and handsomely-illustrated works .

		Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	-LRB- who is happily not among the dead -RRB- has written her artistic autobiography in the form of a volume of '' Recollections and Reflections . ''

		Finally , our veteran critic of the drama , Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, whom we all love and respect even if he is crotchetty on the sub - ject of most modern developments , is to give us in '' Other Days '' his memories of the vanished past of American stage-land .

		This is a book which will parallel in interest Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's '' Musical Memories . ''

		The historical announcements for this year offer rather less than the usual number of books of wide general interest .

		We suppose this is because of the prevailing specialization of the younger generation of historians .

		Under this head we find little to note save a group of works concerned with the history of
Canada	LOCATION	, a subject which is naturally of prime interest in this tercentennial year .

		Mr.
Frank B. Tracy	PERSON	is the author of '' The Tercentenary History of Can - ada , '' and Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	of '' The Making of
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Charles W. Colby	PERSON	is to give us a volume on '' Canadian Types of the Old Regime , '' and Mr.
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	a his - tory of ♦ ' The Search for the Western Sea . ''

		These four announcements seem to us the most interesting in the department of history , but we may add a few others , such as the late
Jeremiah Curtin	PERSON	's '' The Mongols in
Russia	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Rupert S. Holland	PERSON	's '' The BuUders of
United Italy	LOCATION	, '' the late
F. W. Maitland	PERSON	's lectures on `` The Constitutional History of
England	LOCATION	, '' and a posthumous volume of '' Historical and Political Essays '' by
W. E. H. Lecky	PERSON	.

		Many important historical works now in progress are being car - ried on , and new volumes are being added to the various series .

		In the field of literary criticism , Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne 's long-awaited volume on '' The Age of Shakespeare '' occupies the place of first impor - tance .

		We presume that this will turn out to be in large measure a revision of the author 's long series of studies of individual Elizabethan dramatists , contributed during a term of many years to the English monthlies .

		The publica - tion of these studies in book form has long been desired by students of English literature .

		In literary history , as in political history , most of the work is now done by specialists , and takes the form of text-books , or additions to series , or contributions to such cooperative enterprises as the great ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	History of English Literature , '' the third volume of which is soon to appear .

		Books that are themselves literature , instead of being about literature , are apt to be un - heralded , unless they come from authors of established fame .

		We note the promise of collections of essays by Mr.
S. M. Crothers	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	, Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	.

		We note a new imaginary conversation , the subject being `` Justice and Liberty , '' by that singularly polished and thoughtful writer , Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	.

		We note in the drama , '' The Winter Feast , '' by Mr.
Charles Rann Kennedy	PERSON	, `` The House of Rimmon , '' by Mr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	, '' Getting Married , and Other Plays , '' by Mr.
G. B. Shaw	PERSON	, and the new stage-arrangement of `` Faust , '' by Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	.

		In the way of poetry , nothing noticeable is promised , but that is the case nearly every year , although when the year is ended , we can usually reckon up a fairly respectable output .

		Novelists this year are as numerous as ever .

		Almost at a venture , although not wholly with - out selective judgment , we will close this sum - mary by naming a score of books of fiction -- about equally divided between the two countries -- which may confidently be expected to provide us with entertainment , and something more in most of the cases .

		Our list is as follows : '' Helianthus , '' by '' Ouida '' ; '' The Testing of
Diana Mallory	PERSON	, '' by Mrs.

		With this score of books by well-known writers to rely upon , to say nothing of hundreds of others for supplementary reading , the devotee of the novel should find no lack of occupation during the coming year .

		ARNOLD AND
LOWELL	LOCATION	.

		Hail to the English-speaking Dioscuri of our past age !

		Chief critics of their time , they really , though separated by the seas , fought side by side in the fight for the humanities against materialism .

		Their activities were parallel .

		One roused the quarry up , and the other killed it .

		One lifted up his torch and lit the recesses of the jungle , and the other sent his arrows in fierce flight amid the herds of its hoofed and tusked denizens .

		The literature and art of any generation are the surplusage of its life , -- what is left over after its debts and expenses have been paid .

		They are the fund which is handed on to posterity ; and the great critics are the executors , the guardians , the distrib - utors of this fund .

		It is the business of criticism to keep clear and distinct the intellectual and spirit - ual triumphs of the past , and to spur new minds on to emulation of such achievements .

		But for crit - icism , the masterpieces of literature and art would be like the buried cities of Yucatan -- shapeless mounds overgrown with inextricable forest .

		The instincts of both
Arnold	LOCATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	were to be builders of temples and cities of their own rather than clearers of the rubbish of the past or pathfinders and guides to their generation .

		Possibly their most permanent work is in pure art -- the expression of emotion , or greatness , or beauty ; but the world found them so useful as critics that it kept them at that less congenial business .

		They had the blood of kings in them , but their contemporaries insisted on placing them in the seats of judges .

		In criticism ,
Lowell	PERSON	is more the preserver of the Past ;
Arnold	LOCATION	, more the originator , the innovator , in the Present .

		Lowell 's essays were a little old - fashioned even when they were born ; but , like many old-fashioned things , they have a richness and sim - plicity that will outlast novelties .

		His papers have a fulness , an extracted blend of thinking , which makes us recur to them again and again .

		Scattered over them are passages whose diction is of weightier metal than anything in
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		Arnold is alert , striking , even startling .

		He has a new analysis .

		His ideas open up vistas where before was gloom .

		His phrases are the keenest and handiest of critical weapons .

		Perhaps they were so deft and easy of use that their edges have become a little dulled .

		Often , too , they had an air of finality about them -- and finalities are always half-truths at best .

		Both critics have their days of languor , their list of failures .

		Lowell 's cleverness often became smartness , and
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's fastidiousness frequently landed him in strange company .

		Lowell was too uncertain in his judgments , and Arnold too oracular .

		Lowell was of two minds about
Dryden	PERSON	, and a dozen about Pope ; and his essay on
Keats	PERSON	is as unsatis - factory as that of Arnold on Shelley .

		Both men , however , illustrated the truth that the best criticism is by the way -- is to be found in side-flashes of light on single subjects , rather than in a determinate at - tempt to get the whole body of Hterature judged in lump .

		It may be against the permanence of
Arnold	LOCATION	's criticism , that it was too effective , -- that it was caught up and absorbed in the thinking of the day .

		Once read , Arnold can not be forgotten -- which may be an argument against reading him anew ; whereas
Lowell	PERSON	's leisurely performances , more deeply in - fused with personality , more artistically fashioned , leave only a faint memory in our minds , which still lures us to read them again and again .

		When it comes to the poetry of the two men , the exact reverse of all this is the case .

		Lowell 's poetry impresses us tremendously on a first reading , -- car - ries us off our feet .

		But we do not want , -- at least , I do not want , -- to recur to it again .

		Arnold 's verse , on the other hand , seems a little cold and difficult at first , but it fascinates , and we find our - selves going back and back to it and carrying it always in our memory .

		The reason is that
Lowell	PERSON	in verse is primarily a moralist , a preacher ; while
Arnold	LOCATION	is above all things an artist .

		Lowell started in poetry with as good a sensuous equipment as
Arnold	LOCATION	; but his
New England	LOCATION	conscience labored mightily within him , and killed off the images of beauty and grandeur .

		The Sensuous presented her undraped figure to him , but Didacticism plucked him back .

		He saw flowers blossoming beyond him , but he was tied to his
New England	LOCATION	rocks .

		All that noble emotion and high enthusiasm and Drydenic eloquence could do he accomplished in the '' Com - memoration Ode , '' `` The Cathedral , '' and many other pieces .

		They convince , but they do not charm .

		The soul of poetry is trying to get into a body in order to reach us .

		And once , in the opening lines 168 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, of `` The Vision of Sir Launfal '' it attains its desire .

		How different is it with Arnold !

		He too is laden with Didacticism , with the passion of thought ; but he rarely allows these to overweight the form .

		The great ideas of the ''
Obermann	PERSON	'' pieces are em - bodied in images which we can see and feel .

		The blank verse of '' Empedocles '' is as real as the moun - tain meadows and thickets themselves ; and the enchanting lyrics of that piece gleam like mountain nymphs rising from their bath .

		The thoughts and words and cadences of '' The Scholar Gypsy '' and '' Thyrsis '' are like one rich draught distilled from a thousand simples .

		There can be little question which is the greater poet .

		Perhaps
Lowell	PERSON	's most unique claim to remem - brance is his creative humor .

		Here and there in his essays are little sketches of character which are as good as
Goldsmith	PERSON	's work in that kind .

		`` The Courtin ' '' is a perfect idyl of humor and tenderness .

		But it is the ''
Biglow	PERSON	Papers '' which prove him to be , not certainly our greatest humorist , but our best -- if that distinction can be understood .

		He did for
New England	LOCATION	, in a minor way , what
Scott or Burns	PERSON	did for
Scotland	LOCATION	-- set his community on its legs , gave it a separate existence in literature , bodied forth the provincialities and oddities which differ - entiated it from the rest of the world .

		The vein of humor was in
Arnold	LOCATION	also , but it only cropped out in one little book , '' Friendship 's Garland . ''

		This handful of scenes , however , is so replete with wit and humor and creative genius that one is willing to believe in
Arnold	LOCATION	's ability to project character to any extent had he desired .

		The balance of good work in this kind is largely in
Lowell	LOCATION	's favor .

		In satire he is without competition from his rival .

		The '' Fable for Critics , '' while too good-natured and too entirely of the day to be of great value , has not been surpassed in
America	LOCATION	, and , indeed , it is difficult to see that there is anything better in English literature since
Byron	PERSON	.

		Letter-writing is hardly yet ranked with the ac - cepted forms of literature , but I think it will come more and more to be received as a delightful kind of art .

		Now
Lowell	PERSON	's letters are the best we have yet had from an American writer ; indeed , they are the only ones which can vie with the best in English literature .

		Poe 's letters are the poorest products of his pen .

		Lanier 's have much charm , but he was so critically wrong-headed about so many things that his affectionateness and enthusiasm lose their effect .

		Arnold 's letters , so far as they have been given to the public , are dull beyond anything one would deem possible .

		They are the epistles of an overworked and weary Inspector of Schools , and it would re - quire a divining-rod to discover any fount of charm in them .

		Lowell and Arnold were both in a large degree public men .

		They were not mere cloistered stu - dents , belletristic triflers -- as one of them ironically dubbed himself ; they were men who mingled in the affairs of the world , and whose opinions and acts helped to mould great events .

		The apparent weight of influence is on
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's side .

		He was in the thick of the fight from the first .

		His Abolition poems , the `` Biglow Papers , '' his many political essays before and during the Civil War , undoubtedly made him one of the leaders who guided our Republic during trying years .

		And afterwards , his Ambassadorships and his addresses in
England	LOCATION	fairly won him his place as our
First Citizen	ORGANIZATION	.

		He defended Democracy ; but while he loved homely humanity , it is difficult to believe that he had much faith in the wisdom of the masses .

		Like every poet , he admired extraordinary men and women , and he thought that Democracy was the best soil to bring them forth .

		In comparison with these activities ,
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's public efforts seem modest ones .

		Yet if we count his work in school reform , the solvent character of the ideas and phrases about social life which he put into circula - tion , and the effect of his keen and just criticism of Irish affairs , we may find that his influence was at least equal to that of his more eminent contemporary .

		There was one field into which Arnold adven - tured where
Lowell	PERSON	did not follow him .

		He gave up some of his best years to a revision of Christianity -- to the formulation of a working faith for the mod - ern man .

		He put the ideas of the German and French rationalists into attractive guise , gave them the stamp of his own nature .

		But his efforts can hardly be counted more than a pleasing futility .

		His idea of a religion with the supernatural , the miraculous , left out , is no more like a real religion than a domestic Tabby purring by the fireside is like the Lion of the Desert , the lordly dreamer whose roar dominates the j ungle .

		He was neither a great enough poet nor a deep enough philosopher to understand how Superstition -- `` mother of form and fear '' -- is enthroned in the stoutest and noblest breasts .

		Man knows that he is composed of and surrounded by mir - acles and mysteries .

		A few more or less do not matter to him ; rather , he craves them as explaining the ones he feels .

		In the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	there were writers and teachers of philosophy and ethics in plenty -- Academics , Stoics , Epicureans .

		They formulated maxims and systems of morality as good as any the world has known ; but the world about them cared little for their labors .

		When the Latin race found its own first simple mythologies fading away , it opened its doors to the gorgeous and mystical wor - ships of the
East	LOCATION	.

		The
Magna Mater	ORGANIZATION	,
Isis	ORGANIZATION	,
Osiris	LOCATION	, and Anubis , entered in turn the gates of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Men marshalled themselves to follow Cybele ; they placed themselves under a platform and bathed in the blood of a bull slaughtered above -- so to receive purification .

		And when Christianity dawned upon the Western World it was not accepted and believed because of the personal charm of its founder , because of his sweet reasonableness or wit or wisdom .

		No ; it was received because he was thought to be incar - nate God -- immaculate of birth , a sacrifice for man .

		A halo of all the mysteries and wonders of the world was about him , and men 's spirits rose and stood on tiptoe in rapture and fear .

		So it ever was , and so it always will be .

		A religion which does not explain
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 the mazes of our present life , which does not carry with it the awful sanctions of the future , can not live or be of use in the world .

		Arnold and
Lowell	PERSON	covered more ground than almost any of their compeers .

		Yet probably neither of them did the supreme work he dreamed of doing -- the one thing worth while .

		Of all their varied work , perhaps
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's poetry will come to stand highest in the estimation of mankind .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		`` Light through work '' is the encouraging motto of the young and active
New York Association	ORGANIZATION	for the Blind , whose '' First Report , '' well illustrated and packed with interesting matter , has recently ap - peared .

		The city of
New York	LOCATION	has more than 2300 blind persons , and there the first intelligent and en - ergetic move on a considerable scale has been made toward rendering the lot of the blind less hard by an education -LRB- in their own homes and elsewhere -RRB- that shall render them self-supporting and self-respecting citizens .

		Historically , the education of the blind may be dated from the hour when the sightless boy
Leseur	PERSON	, the first pupil of
Valentin Hatty	PERSON	, who in
1784	DATE	founded the
National Institution	ORGANIZATION	for the Blind , in
Paris	LOCATION	, ran to his master with a piece of paper on which the letter had been accidentally embossed . ''

		Sir , '' he cried , '' I can feel it ; it is the letter O. '' To Miss
Winifred Holt	PERSON	, secretary of the
New York Association	ORGANIZATION	, and her sister Miss
Edith Holt	PERSON	, the recording secretary , is due the credit of taking the first steps that led to the formation of the
Associa	LOCATION	- tion .

		The whole story is interestingly told in the Report .

		The devotion of Miss
Winifred Holt	PERSON	to her chosen work deserves especial praise .

		Amid many other proofs of her zeal , this passage from her pen is significant : '' I learned in a short time with bound eyes to read both Braille and
New York Point	LOCATION	and to write them ; thus any conclusions which I may have reached have been drawn from the blind man 's standpoint . ''

		Illustrations from photographs give variety and interest to this readable document , and also serve to show how far from helpless the blind may become under proper training .

		A blind barber at his work is the subject of one of these pictures .

		Words from
Mark Twain	PERSON	and Miss
Helen Keller	PERSON	, ofiicers of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, find appropriate place in its Report .

		The leaden-footed library page -LRB- of course he is not found in any of those well-ordered libraries to which The Dial makes its way -RRB- has been made the subject of some facetious paragraphs from the pen of '' The Librarian '' of the ''
Boston Evening Transcript	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It is pleasant to learn that the long - cherished scheme of Mr.
Oscar Gustafsen	PERSON	-LRB- formerly librarian of the
Ezra Beesley	PERSON	Free Library of the town of
Baxter	LOCATION	, and now instructor in bibliography at
Philander University	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- for establishing a training - school for library pages has been in a measure car - ried to execution by his successor at
Baxter	LOCATION	,
Miss Letitia Van Remsen	ORGANIZATION	, in the course of training offered by her to would-be pages , under the auspices of the
Beesley Free Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		While we doubt whether Mr.
Gustafsen	PERSON	's fond ideal has been entirely realized by Miss Van
Remsen	LOCATION	, yet the entrance examination papers set by her give promise of a thorough and rigorous training to the successful candidates for admission .

		What could be more admirable than her test questions on '' General Information and Expe - rience '' ?

		After a number of distorted book-titles to be put right -- a most useful exercise for those who have to run for vaguely or wrongly designated books -- the examination paper proceeds : '' -LRB- 2 -RRB- How do you tell a library trustee from one of the ordinary public ?

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Do you smoke cigarettes ?

		-LRB- Note : An affirma - tive answer will be fatal to your chances of passing ; a negative one will cast suspicions on your truthful - ness . -RRB-

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- What answer would you give to a person who asked , ' Is all the friction in the library in this room ? '

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- Write a description -LRB- with diagrams -RRB- of about 500 words , telling what , in your opinion , should be done with -LRB- a -RRB- the person who says , ' I suppose you have read all the books in the library !

		* -LRB- b -RRB- the person who says , ' It must be nice to work in a library and read all the time ! '

		-LRB- c -RRB- the one who remarks , ' Library work must be lovely -- it 's such clean work ! ' ''

		Ability to pass the entrance examina - tion will abundantly prove the candidate 's aptitude for library work .

		, , , The evolution of ''
Joshua Whitcomb	PERSON	'' is a study of some interest and timeliness at this season , when `` Joshua '' himself is beginning his annual tour of the large cities .

		Well on in his seventies now , and known to most of us as the slow-moving , good - humored , warm-hearted `` Uncle
Josh	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Denman Thompson	PERSON	was in his younger days more celebrated on the stage for his nimbleness of foot than for his homely , realistic charm as an impersonator of Yankee character .

		An attack of rheumatism worked the transformation from vaudeville dancer to star actor and universal favorite with the great theatre - going public .

		But the change did not come all at once .

		The initial idea of a quaint , honest , uncari - catured
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	, new to the stage , led first to the creation of a twenty-minute sketch of the variety - show pattern .

		It was given for two weeks at
Pitts	LOCATION	- burg in
1875	DATE	, and thence proceeded to make the rounds of the West , winning unusual success .

		From that to the ''
Joshua Whitcomb	PERSON	'' of the
New York Academy of Music	ORGANIZATION	and the
Boston Theatre	LOCATION	was a development of some years .

		Theatre-managers and theatrical critics predicted the flat failure of the amorphous production , and did their best to kill it ; but the public knew what it liked , and both this play and its successor , `` The Old Homestead , '' have poured into the pockets of skeptical theatre-managers more dollars than could be denoted by fewer than seven figures .

		They have the '' one touch of nature '' 160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, which goes so much further than art in the long run .

		It is said by those who know Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	that ''
Josh	PERSON	'' and '' Den '' are one and the same .

		The only difference between the actor and the man is that the latter is even more delightfully real and witty , hearty and human , than the former .

		• ■ • Hamlet as an undergkaduate is far less known to the world than Hamlet the melancholy Dane and Hamlet the madman -LRB- genuine or feigned -RRB- .

		But an anonymous writer in a current periodical in - geniously accounts for the unhappy prince 's failure to grapple promptly and successfully with the situa - tion confronting him by ascribing his ineffectiveness to an over-addiction to academic pursuits .

		`` The simple truth of the matter , '' declares this writer , '' is that Hamlet had been too long at the university .

		We find him at thirty still a student at
Wittenberg	LOCATION	, pro- longing his college life nearly ten years beyond the legitimate time , whether from difficulty with the curriculum , or from desire to participate longer in college amusements , or from sheer lust for scholar - ship , we do not know .

		Most of the problems that have puzzled the critics can be explained in the light of this simple fact , and the evidence in favor of this supposition is overwhelming when the text is exam - ined .

		First of all , when the terrible revelation of a father 's murder , a mother 's shame , an uncle 's guilt , is made to Hamlet by the ghost , what does he do ?

		He hunts for his notebook . '' '

		My tablets I Meet it is I set it down That one may smile and smile and be a villain . '

		The undergraduate habit of mind !

		That which should have burned itself into the memory forever written down to save the trouble of remembering it ; moreover , the damning concrete fact turned into a generalization !

		Here two phases of the training of the schools are clearly set forth by Shakespeare . ''

		After this , who shall say that there is nothing new under the sun , or that half the possible books about
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his plays have yet been written ?

		• • • Library activity in
Indiana	LOCATION	is encouragingly brisk .

		This is attested in various ways by the latest issue of `` Library Occurrent , '' published by the
Indiana Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		A hopeful sign is the bi-state library convention to be held at •
Louisville	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	, this
autumn	DATE	, when representa - tives from both the Blue Grass and the Hoosier states will meet , exchange ideas , and incidentally admire
Louisville	LOCATION	's new library building and its branches .

		Much attention is paid to children 's wants in this number of the '' Occurrent . ''

		A writer of '' Some Notes on Children 's Books '' says , among many other things : '' Animal stories come next to fairy tales as dealing with things most familiar to children .

		Some striking examples of good animal stories are : Beau - tiful
Joe	PERSON	,
Black Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, The Jungle Books , and
Jack	PERSON	the Fire-Dog .

		When an author has produced one good book , always watch for the next one , as it may not be up to the standard .

		Mai ` shall
Saunders	ORGANIZATION	's Beau - tiful
Joe	PERSON	's
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	is a monstrosity and a failure . ''

		Miss
Florence L. Jones	PERSON	, of the
Indianapolis	LOCATION	Public Library , writes on '' Reference Work with Schools in the
Indianapolis	LOCATION	Public Library . ''

		One short para - graph that will strike a responsive chord in many a library worker 's breast runs -LRB- in a style that invites correction -RRB- as follows : '' Probably the most difficult question that an attendant has to find is material for a debate .

		If a teacher knew how the attendant 's heart sinks when she hears that word ' Resolved , * she would let the library know -LSB- sometime in ad - vance -RSB- that such a debate was to take place . ''

		The debater is indeed only one degree less patience - trying to librarians than the genealogy-hunter .

		• • • The
Grub Street	ORGANIZATION	author of affluence has displaced the Grub Street starveling , if we may believe Mr.
Gilson Willetts	PERSON	, who writes in `` The American Magazine '' of the comparative ease and certainty with which a very comfortable income can be earned by a literary worker of industry and en - terprise .

		Of his own experience , which certainly seems unromantic enough to be true , he says : '' I have been writing , nothing but writing , for eighteen years without a single interruption of any kind , always as a free lance .

		I have produced 7,200,000 words for which I received
$ 72,000	MONEY	.

		My articles and stories have appeared in ninety different mag - azines and weeklies and in forty newspapers , besides syndicate articles in 500 newspapers , I have written nine books , including two novels , works of reference , and books of the ' premium ' class .

		Combined sale of these books , 750,000 .

		I have written more .

		than 1500 different magazine articles , and over 100 short stories , and heaven knows how many pamphlets and advertisements .

		My ' stuff ' has appeared over 100 different names ... My workshop is a word fac - tory ; capacity , 3000 words a day . ''

		There is cheer and comfort in all this .

		If the building trades decline so that one can no longer be a brick-maker , with a capability of three thousand or five thousand bricks a day , one can very easily turn writer and open a literary workshop , '' capacity , 3000 words a day . ''

		Mr.
Willetts	PERSON	reminds us of that anonymous author of certain confessions of a hack-writer that appeared some years ago in `` The Forum . ''

		Possi - bly he is that anonymous writer , reappearing in one of his '' one hundred different names '' or literary disguises .

		... Architectural effect in the library build - ing is probably far more important than most users of public libraries suspect .

		In the mere mounting of the marble steps leading to a nobly conceived and finely executed structure for the storage and distri - bution of books , one 's tone is unconsciously elevated so that it becomes next to impossible to approach the delivery desk and ask , with entire self-respect , for a '' shilling shocker '' instead of a book of real worth .

		An interesting investigation , if one had time and patience to make it , would be a careful comparision of the grade and character of the reading matter cir -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 culated by libraries poorly or meanly housed , and by libraries enjoying the dignity of handsome and im - posing quarters ; or a comparison of a library 's cir - culation , in its character and tone , before and after l-emoval from shabby surroundings to a more suitable and worthy environment .

		The '' Ninth Annual Report '' of the
Carnegie Library of Atlanta	ORGANIZATION	contains a frontispiece view of the library 's new building -- new , that is , with the opening of the century .

		The imposing front , with its stately Ionic columns , is very pleasing to the eye .

		Some such architectural effect we can imagine
Madame de Sta6l	ORGANIZATION	to have had in mind when she wrote , in her '' Corinne '' : '' La vue d'un tel monument est comma une musique contin - uelle at fix ^ e. '' It is not surprising to be assured by Miss
Anne Wallace	PERSON	, whose enviable lot it is to occupy the post of librarian at
Atlanta	LOCATION	, that '' the Library , more than any other department of the
City	LOCATION	govern - ment , shows the growth of the
City	LOCATION	, '' and that new settlers in
Atlanta	LOCATION	show a gratifying inclination to enjoy the privileges of its fine library .

		• • • A MARVEL OF MINUTE BESEAKCH appears in the shape of a volume entitled '' A Study of Splashes . ''

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	writes from
London	LOCATION	in real or pretended perplexity as to the meaning and mission of such a book ; '' but the title awakens curiosity , '' he adds , '' and the volume is by a professor of physics at a royal naval engineering college . ''

		The author , it appears from other and fuller sources of information , is Professor
Worthington	PERSON	of the
Royal Naval Engineering College	ORGANIZATION	at
Davenport	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	; and he is said to have spent seven patient years spill - ing drops of various liquids from various heights on a smooth surface , and studying the resultant splashes , thereby -LRB- presumably -RRB- adding to the sum of human knowledge on the laws of impact and the behavior of liquid molecules when suddenly arrested in full career .

		Some day -- for even the most unpromis - ing and , humanly speaking , uninteresting facts do sometimes have a way of revealing their significance to the right man and on the right occasion -- these splashes may revolutionize some department of art or science .


Galileo	ORGANIZATION	, counting the oscillations of the hanging lamp in the cathedral at
Pisa	LOCATION	, was probably thought by more than one worshipper to be indulg - ing a foolish as well as a profane curiosity ; but time -LRB- as measured by the clock -RRB- has abundantly vindi - cated the young man .

		And so the more than Ger - man zeal and patience of the liquid-dropping English professor may , in time or eternity , be rewarded , and minute research will again have justified its ways to jmen .

		.

		, , An Algonquin college pkofessorship would strike most people as a novelty in the educational world , but a plea for the establishment of one in some college of
New England	LOCATION	where the language was once spoken is made by Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	in `` The Christian Register . ''

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	asserts that '' the Algonquin languages were and are spoken over a wider range of country than the Latin language had in the day of the widest range of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		At this hour Algonquin dialects are used in daily conversation as far as
Newfoundland	LOCATION	on the east and to the neighborhood of
Alaska	LOCATION	on the west . ''

		All this is apropos of a recently published history of the
First Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Roxbury	LOCATION	, which naturally revives memories of
John Eliot	PERSON	and his missionary labors among the Indians , notably his translation of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Hale	PERSON	thinks that if the book were not so exceedingly rare , or if some publisher would reprint one of the Gospels as a commercial venture , there would be a good many persons interested in making some acquaintance with the work .

		He notes with approval the existence of an Indian-language professorship at
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, and thinks that '' some one would like to endow a scholarship in
Harvard or Smith	ORGANIZATION	or
Amherst	LOCATION	or
Wellesley	LOCATION	which shall provide for the education of some young person who would agree to study the Algonquin language side by side with Greek and German and Latin and French and English . ''

		May the suggestion bear fruit !

		But aside from a curious interest to the comparative philologist , the Algonquin dialects have woefully little to lure the literary stu - dent , '' side by side with Greek and German and Latin and French and English . ''

		• • • A successful novelist 's self-restraint in production is a manifestation of not exactly daily occurrence .

		Hence our readiness to chronicle , with mingled admiration and regret , Mr.
Stanley J. Weyman	PERSON	's announcement that no more novels are to come from his pen .

		All who have read and enjoyed his '' Gentleman of
France	LOCATION	'' and '' House of the Wolf '' -- pioneers in their kind , being writ - ten before the historical romance of word-play and hairbreadth escape was done to death -- will be sorry and at the same time glad that Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	has dropped his novel-reading public before the lat - ter showed signs of dropping him .

		His latest -LRB- and last -RRB- piece of fiction , '' The Wild Geese , '' was issued in a first edition of more than 20,000 copies for
England	LOCATION	alone -- an indication of expected if not yet fully realized success .

		Possibly the twenty-thousand edition did not go off with all the desired speed .

		At any rate , it is unusual to see a popular novelist deliberately and voluntarily • lay down his pen at only a little past fifty years of age .

		We wonder whether perhaps Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	has been reading ' * The Altar Fire '' and has taken fright at the dismal picture there painted of the written-out story-teller .

		Poet and
Herring Merchant	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Those who have read
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's letters , and thus become interested in his very unusual personality , will welcome Mr.
Bljrth	PERSON	's book , which tells the story of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's remarkable friendship for
Joseph Fletcher	PERSON	, a sturdy , over self-reliant , rather obstinate , and somewhat un - appreciative Lowestoft fisherman , and of their partnership as owners of a lugger engaged in the herring fisheries , a partnership that endured for nearly eight years .

		In giving the story of this most remarkable friendship , Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	introduces effectively a series of hitherto unpublished letters from
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald to Fletcher	PERSON	, and also several illustrations , including portraits of `` Posh '' -LRB-
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's fa - miliar name for
Fletcher	PERSON	-RRB- , and \ iews of the places about which the interest of the narrative centres .

		The translator , we might almost say the crea - tor , of the Rubaiyat of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	so far as its English readers are concerned , was fifty - six years old when he first met '' Posh , '' who was twenty-seven .

		His admiration and affection seem to have been almost immediately engaged ; but not even the infinite pains Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	has taken to portray the big fisherman can explain the place he gained in
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's heart .

		The poet and recluse does not simply extol his herring-fisher as great of his kind , but as great in the abstract .

		He invests him with honor , truth , integrity , nobility , even with high-born qualities of soul .

		Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	looked eagerly for these ; it seems as if he really expected to find them , or would distrust his own discernment if he failed .

		Yet his minute record is barren of the hoped-for results .

		Even the face of the young man , as seen in his portrait , is not alive with an alert intelligence .

		It is weU featured , but ordinary and vacant .

		There is no quotation from his conversation or letters which uncovers wit , humor , candor , appreciation , pathos , integ - rity , affection , or fidelity .

		The letters of the senior member of this strange partnership seem struggling to impress upon the other such commonplaces of courtesy as acknowledging a communication or confidence , the common honesty of debt-paying , the common importance of a written account in a partnership business , the common decency of sobriety , -- ♦ EdwardFitzGbrald AND `` Posh '' -- `` Herring Merchants .

London	LOCATION	:
John Long	ORGANIZATION	.

		all of which seems to have been received with stolid indifference , toleration of the eccentrici - ties of gentlemen , or unconcealed resentment .

		Yet for many years
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	identified his fortunes with those of '' Posh , '' shut the door of one side of his mind , apparently , upon his stored oriental imagery , and only let the light in upon his views concerning herring and mackerel , and the game of `` All-fours , '' -- the business , the health , the diversion , and the safety of '' Posh ''
Fletcher	PERSON	.

		He even sent the picture of '' Posh '' to his friend
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	, in
1870	DATE	, with a letter in which he describes the original as '' en - dowed with all the qualities of soul and body to make him leader '' ; and adds : '' I know no one of sounder sense and grander manners in what - ever company . ''

		This , of the man who dodged and avoided Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	, and broke all appoint - ments , with the excuse , when finally cornered , that one man had made off with his letters '' and never gave me a farden for what he larnt off o ' me '' ; while others had been guilty of '' pickin ' my brains , and never givin ' me so much as a six - pence . ''

		A financial guarantee finally brought '' Posh '' to close quarters , and gave Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	a chance to search for the basis of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's infatuation for the man who had '' torn up sa `` k - fuls '' of his letters , though the few remaining ones were sold for his benefit ; and it is to the
Omar Khayyam Club	ORGANIZATION	and other
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	con - nections that the '' Posh '' of
1907	DATE	owes the fact of a roof over his head .

		He was still unable to understand that reminiscences of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	are of greater public interest than any recollection of '' Posh , '' and insisted on having the dimen - sions of the herring-lugger stated in the book , because he designed it himself !

		Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	believes that the new personality of the youth of twenty-seven magnetized the poet of fifty-six .

		The reader feels like changing the expression to hypnotized .

		Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	says that
FitzGerald	PERSON	`` saw his friend through a glamor which set up a mirage of things which were not , and it was like him to attribute excel - lences to his friend which only existed in his own imagination . ''

		Surely some such strange reason must be discovered why a poet who , con - fessedly , did not know the stem from the stern of a ship , should go into the herring business at sixty years of age !

		He often found himself obliged to remind his ideal Captain of such sordid things as the importance of debt-paying , -- although it does not appear that his anxiety was to avoid pecuniary loss to himself , -- and to admonish him to sobriety , both of which were done to sustain his faith in his '' man of

		THE DIAL 163 a royal nature , '' of whom he said , '' If he should turn out knave , I shall have done with all faith in my own judgment ; and if he should go to the bottom of the sea in the lugger , I sha n't cry for the lugger . ''

		Even in the gayeties of
London	LOCATION	, his imagination brought the fisherman , in whose moral excellences he believed , to bear him better company , and to '' make a face '' at the environment .

		It was through the two faults which the silent partner would hardly admit as faults , that the partnership in the '' Meum and Tuum , '' as
FitzGerald	PERSON	said , '' turned out all Tuum and no Meum , '' and after many broken promises was finally dissolved ; although the disappointed senior had declared : '' If he is but what I think him , I would rather lose money with him than gain it with others . ''

		To Professor Cowell he wrote : '' You ca n't think what a grand , tender soul he is ! ''

		And to Mr.
Spalding	PERSON	: '' It makes me feel ashamed very much to play the judge on one who stands immeasurably above me in the scale , whose faults are better than so many virtues . ''

		The bitterness of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's dawning dis - covery that his estimate of his protege 's char - acter was too exalted , with his growing loss of confidence and respect , constituted a sore expe - rience ; but his love and solicitude for '' Posh '' survived even the latter 's stupid ingratitude .

		Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	well says : '' No one has a greater admiratioa than I for this magnificent claim of a MAN to be MAN 'S equal .

		But with
FitzGerald	PERSON	, who never asserted the claims of his station in life before an inferior , the obtrusive display of this spirit of independence was as unnecessary as it was cruel .

		And I think Posh understands this now .

		... But in
1869	DATE	, Posh thought that he was a very fine fellow indeed , and was not going to be put upon by any ' guvnor , ' no matter how kind the ' guvnor ' had been to him .

		He would assert himself .

		He did . ''

		It was as late as
1870	DATE	that
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	asked
Laurence	PERSON	to paint a portrait of '' Posh , '' and said : '' The man 's soul is every way as well propor - tioned , missing in nothing that may become a man .

		... I should like a large oil sketch , to hang up with
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, with whom he shares a certain grandeur of soul and body . ''

		And again : '' You will see a little of his simplicity of soul ; but not
the Justice of Thought	ORGANIZATION	,
Tenderness of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, and all other good gifts which make him a Gentleman of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's grand - est type . ''

		Later still , he writes to Laurence : '' I am sure the man is fit to be king of a kingdom .

		I declare you and I have seen A Man !

		Have we not ?

		Made in the mould of what Humanity should be .

		Body and Soul , a poor Fisherman . ''

		Even in
1874	DATE	, he writes : '' There is greatness about the Man ... Your Cromwells ,
Caesars	ORGANIZATION	, and Napoleons have not been more scrupulous . ''

		The break came , '' Posh '' admits , by his own motion .

		The conclusion of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	had been , '' The Man is so beyond others , as I think , that I have come to feel that I must not condemn him by general rule . ''

		He had written and sealed a document which would secure to '' Posh '' immunity from indebtedness to his estate if he should die ; but he had exacted a promise of sobriety , which was promptly broken . ''

		Posh '' still upholds his independence in the matter , especially as to the restriction that he should be a teetotaller .

		In 1 874 the '' Mum Turn '' was sold at auction ; and long afterward , when she was broken up , her name-board was presented to the
Omar Khaj ^ am Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		FitzGerald had been dimly disillusioned , -- and he was old . ''

		He was a good gentleman , was Old Fitz , '' say the rem - nant of East Anglian fishermen ; who , unaware of the poet , well remember the faithful friend of `` Posh ''
Fletcher	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Blyth	PERSON	ends his record thus : '' The last time he was with me I read him -- '' ' The moving Finger writes , and having writ .

		Moves on : nor all your Piety and Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a line .

		Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it . ' '' '

		Phases of Modern ^ Socialism .

		* Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, as he himself explains , '' calls himself a Socialist , but he is by no means a fanatical or uncritical adherent .

		To him , Socialism presents itself as a very noble but a very human and fallible system of ideas .

		He does in all sincerity regard its spirit , its intimate substance , as the most hopeful thing in human affairs at the present time , but he does also find it shares with all mundane concerns the quali - ties of inadequacy and error . ''

		The book which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has written from this standpoint , entitled '' New Worlds for Old , '' forms a very good introduction to Socialism .

		It will attract and interest those who are not of that faith , and correct those who are .

		Herein , no doubt , the movement has followed the line of the least resistance , it being taken for granted that if the ship could fairly get under way she would have no difficulty in reaching her port of destination .

		This attitude is not peculiar to socialists ; it is very conspicuous among vari - ous religious societies ; but it has been especially fostered by those almost fatalistic notions of political economy which have been handed down from earlier times .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	graphically describes a meeting of the
Social-Democratic Federation	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, at which Mr.
Hyndman	PERSON	lectured on the coming revolution .

		At the end , questions were handed in on smalls slips of paper , one of them being , '' Why trouble to agitate or work if the trusts are going to do it all for us ? '' ''

		The veteran leader of the Social-Democratic
Feder	PERSON	- ation paused only for a moment . '

		Well , we 've got to get ready for it , you know , ' he said , rustling briskly with the folds of the question to follow ; and with these words , it seemed to me , that fatalistic Marxism crum - bled down to dust . ''

		We have got to get ready for it .

		Indeed , we have to make it , by education and intention and set reaolve '' -LRB- p. 236J .

		.

		The last sentence contains the burden of our author 's message to the socialists themselves .

		He would not wait for the automatic fruition of inevitable tendencies ; but would recognize , in the fullest possible manner , that if anything good is to come of it all , it will need the active cooperation of mind and muscle in constructive ways .

		It is perhaps only too possible that a nation , like an individual , might become sat - urated with discontent , only to recognize its inability to remove the cause .

		The same idea emerges in a quite different manner in the discussion of Fabian Socialism , which is so practical that it often goes too far , in Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's opinion , in attempting to utilize existing agencies . ''

		In all these matters the real question at issue is one between the emergency and the implement .

		One may illustrate by a simple comparison .

		Suppose there is a need to dig a hole and that there is no spade available , a Fabian with Mr.
Webb	PERSON	's gifts becomes invaluable .

		He seizes upon a broken old cricket bat , let us say , uses it with admirable wit and skill , and presto !

		there is the hole made and the moral taught that one need not always wait for spades before digging holes .

		It is a lesson that Socialism stood in need of , and which hence - forth it will always bear in mind .

		But suppose we want to dig a dozen holes , it may be worth while to spend a little time in going to beg , borrow , or buy a spade .

		If we have to dig holes indefinitely , day after day , it will be sheer foolishness sticking to the bat .

		It will be worth while then not simply to get a spade , but to get just the right sort of spade in size and form that the soil requires , to get the proper means of sharpening and repairing the spade , to insure a proper supply .

		Or to point the comparison , the reconstruction of our legisla - tive and local government machinery is a necessary pre - liminary to Socialization in many directions .

		Mr.
Webb	PERSON	has very effectually admitted that , is in fact himself leading us away from that by taking up the study of local government as his principal occupation , but the typical '
Webbite	PERSON	' of the Fabian Society , who is very much to
Webb	PERSON	what the Marxist is to
Marx	PERSON	, entranced by his leader 's skill , still clings to the earlier Fabian ideal .

		He dreams of the most foxy and wonderful dig - ging by means of box-lids , tablespoons , dishcovers -- anything but spades designed and made for the job in hand -- just as he dreams of an extensive expropriation of landlords by legislation that includes the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Lords '' -LRB- pp. 254-255 -RRB- .

		The Rev.
R. J. Campbell	PERSON	, Minister of the
City Temple	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, is a very well known and eloquent preacher , who hag recently declared himseK a Socialist , to the distress of many of his brother nonconformists .

		In his book on ''
Chris	PERSON	- tianity and the Social Order '' he undertakes to describe Christianity , as he understands it , and then to show how it harmonizes with Socialism .

		His account of the origin and nature of the Christian faith would be repudiated by the so - caUed orthodox churches , but it is honest and in accord with the historical facts , so far as the author was able to ascertain them .

		I do not know where a better general discussion of the subject may be found ; it is wholly sympathetic , yet not at the expense of truth , and might well carry conviction to those who would not be moved by a colder and more purely scientific treatment .

		Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	does not find in the teaching of Jesus anything resembling modern Socialism , except in purpose and in spirit ; but these are the fundamental things . ''

		He had no economic theories ; no interest in indus - triaUsm ; and laid down no directions for the administra - tion of the ideal
State	ORGANIZATION	, or the guidance of the individual in his social relationships ; His idea was supernatural revolution , not social evolution .

		But the one undeniable and all-important fact about the preaching of this great - est of the sons of men is that it was inspired by a pro- found belief in the coming of a better day and an ideal human society on earth .

		He never says a word about going to heaven , for the plain and simple reason that all His hopes were bound up with the realization of heaven here .

		His illusions were those of the period in which , and the people among whom , He did His work ; His ideal is for all time , and is the inspiration of all that is best and noblest in human aspiration and effort to-day '' -LRB- p. 16 -RRB- .

		The sociological part of the book does not appear to me to be so good -- partly , perhaps , because

		THE DIAL 165 the author has not so long been familiar with the matters discussed .

		: To the reader who has no sympathy with socialistic theories , it will doubtless seem that the two books I have attempted to describe have been altogether overpraised .

		To such readers I would merely say this : that , after all , the dyna - mic conception of society holds ; what we see and have our part in is not merely a phenomenon , but a process , and in the long run humanity will need all the guidance it can get .

		It is not prob - able that the dreams of now living Socialists will ever come true in any literal sense ; but they will nevertheless be woven into the fabric of things , and will stand out as real contributions to an edifice the form of which was beyond their imagining .

		Two things , however , are certain : one , that there wiU be change , and the other that goodwill is indispensable for the well-being of mankind .

		The Socialists , like Jesus , at least forsee the one and possess the other , -- the latter , in spite of occasional appearances to the contrary .

		The Jugglers and the Railroads .

		* The strenuous conduct of the chief executive officer of our nation , in his effort to enforce the recent legislation concerning corporations , has turned the attention of the public with much intensity upon every phase of the railroad in - dustry .

		But the public gaze , though intent , has not been discerning , as is evidenced by the storm of disapprobation that has greeted the recent decision of the
Federal Court of Appeals	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION	in the Standard Oil case .

		To a thoughtful observer , it is amazing to note how intelligent and educated men fail , in discussing this case , to distinguish between the substance and the method of court procedure .

		One is fain to believe that the distinction between executive and legislative and judicial functions , imbedded as it is in our Constitution , has never really taken hold on the American mind , although it is a commonplace of every elementary text-book on our government .

		The outcry against the decision read by Judge
Grosscup	PERSON	suggests un - pleasantly that the canon of conduct so long opprobriously assigned to the Jesuits as their peculiar property -- that '' the end justifies the means '' -- has been assimilated by many secular minds as well as Jesuitical ones .

		may be , the decision calls a halt in the indis - criminate condemnation of corporations , and will doubtless do muph to restore heart and faith to that not unimportant portion of the com - munity which , through the investment of its savings , furnishes the means of carrying on business .

		The literature © # railroad , problems , which has been coming so abundantly from the press in the
last two years	DATE	, is imdoubtedly forming as well as expressing an intelligent opinion that must control in the end .

		Among books of this class , Mr.
Daggett	PERSON	's work on '' Railroad Re - organization '' is doing an inestimable service in discussing one of the most recondite as well as most important phases of railway management -- and mismanagement .

		The public are already sufficiently acquainted with the salient features of railway operation to be able to understand the evils of rebating and undercutting as they have affected the user of transportation ; but little that is intelligible has been written concerning the sins committed in the fields of constructive financiering .

		Mr.
Daggett	PERSON	has given us a care - ful and elaborate account of the reorganization of eight great systems -- reorganization neces - sitated , in the majority of cases , by excessive capitalization in the interest of reckless exten - sions going hand in hand with unfair concessions .

		In the case of two of the roads presented in this treatise -- the
Rock Island	LOCATION	and the
Alton	LOCATION	-- the reorganization was influenced by great pros - perity .

		In the words of Mr.
Daggett	PERSON	, '' It was desired to reap a profit by the sale of new securities , as well as to lessen the investment required for control . ''

		The causes and methods of reorganization are thus admirably summarized : '' A railroad is a complex financial as well as a com - plex operating machine .

		Especially when it has been built up by the union of numerous small properties , each of which has been allowed to retain a certain indi - viduality of its own , are the relations between the dif - ferent parts intricate and involved .

		The obligations which have been incurred in the course of its career , and the kinds of paper which represent these obligations , disclose a variety which the debts of an individual sel - dom or never present .

		This complexity in railroad capitalization inevitably leads to clashes in interest between different classes of security-holders ... If classes of securities exist upon which payment of inter - est is optional , it is to the advantage of the junior issues to prevent payment of interest or dividends upon others until earnings are such that payment may be made upon all .

		If common stockholders can reinvest in the property sums which normally would be paid in divi - dends on the preferred stock , they advance the day upon which they can secure dividends for themselves at the expense of their seniors ... Or , again , it may be to the advantage of speculative stockholders to pay dividends to themselves by means of the accumu - 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, lation of a floating debt , and to sell out at top quo - tations , being the floating debt to take precedence even of mortgage bonds .

		Both this and the preceding oper - ation are facilitated by the control which the least valuable portion of the capital , the common stock , usu - ally has over the policy of the entire company .

		But it is when a reorganization becomes necessary that these conflicts in interest become most apparent , and it is as a compromise between contending forces that a reorgan - ization plan mtist take its shape . ''

		Just at the present time , when the railroads are making a combined demand for increased rates in order that they may avoid the other alternatives of decreased wages or reduced dividends , it is of value to have emphasized , as is here done , the facts of reorganization as affect - ing security-holders .

		In
Erie	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia & Reading	ORGANIZATION	,
Southern	ORGANIZATION	,
Santa Fe	ORGANIZATION	,
Rock Island	LOCATION	, and
Union and Northern Pacifies	ORGANIZATION	, it has been neces - sary again and again to sacrifice the equitable rights of stockholders , so as to '' squeeze out water '' and allow of the road being put on a basis of restored vitality .

		What has been done frequently , may still be done ; and the choice so made , as between the equally innocent in - vestors and consumers , is in favor of the latter .

		In such a choice , the equitable defense is made by emphasizing the involuntary nature of the relation of the shipper to the transport systems , while that of the investor is optional .

		Not until Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's suggestion is embodied in law , and all future issue of bonds or stocks are placed under the supervision of some government board of control , can the investor find protection from his own ignorance or his own folly , as they play into the hands of reckless and unscrupulous promoters of the Wall Street type .

		Education in
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, at present
Superinten	PERSON	- dent of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	Public Schools , has brought together all of the known writings of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	German schoolmaster , giving the German text , an English translation , and a sketch of the teacher 's life .

		Among Dock 's pupils was
Christopher Saur	PERSON	, who succeeded his father at the head of the
Germantown	LOCATION	printing - house which printed three editions of the Bible in German before an English edition appeared in
America	LOCATION	.


Christopher Dock	PERSON	's method of arousing the ambition of his pupils and of putting the slothful to shame , differing widely from the educational methods then in vogue , won the admiration of the elder Saur , who with much difficulty per - suaded Dock to write a treatise describing his plan of organizing and conducting a school .

		The manuscript was completed in
1750	DATE	, and after a number of vicissitudes was published by Saur in
1770	DATE	.

		An indication of
Dock	ORGANIZATION	's method is given in his description of the way a new pupil was received . ''

		The child is first given a welcomie by the other chil - dren who extend their hands to him .

		Then I ask him if he will be diligent and obedient .

		If he promises this , he is told how to behave , and when he can say his A , B , C 's , and point out each letter with his index finger , he is put into the Ab .

		When he reaches this class his father owes him a penny , and his mother must fry him two eggs for his diligence , and the same re - ward is due him with each advance , for instance , when he enters the word class .

		But when he enters the read - ing class , I owe him a present , if he reaches the class in the required time and has been diligent , and the first day this child comes to school he receives a note stating , ' Diligent .

		One pence . '

		This means that he has been admitted to the school , but it is also explained to him that if he is lazy or disobedient his note is taken from him .

		Continued disinclination to learn and stubborness causes the pupil to be proclaimed lazy and inefficient before the whole class , and he is told that he belongs in a school of incorrigibles .

		Then I ask the child again if he will be diligent and obedient .

		Answering yes , he is shown his place .

		If it is a boy , I ask the other boys , if a girl , I ask the girls , who among them will take care of this new child and teach it .

		According to the extent to which the child is known , or its pleasant or unpleasant appearance , more or less children express the willingness .

		If none apply , I ask who will teach this child for a certain time for a bird or a writing-copy .

		Then it is seldom difficult to get a response . ''

		In similar detail Dock described the pupils ' progress through his school .

		Of one stage he said : '' Those who know their lesson receive an O on the hand , traced with crayon .

		This is a mark of excellence .

		Those who fail more than three times are sent back to study their lesson again .

		When all the little ones have recited these are asked again , and any one having failed in more than three trials a second time is called ' Lazy ' by the entire class , and his name is written down .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 Whether such a child fear the rod or not , I know from experience that this denunciation of the children hurts more than if I were constantly to wield and flourish the rod .

		If the pupil 's name has not been erased before dismissal the pupils are at liberty to write down the names of those who have been lazy , and take them along home .

		But if the child learns his lesson well in the future , his name is again presented to the other pupils and they are told that he knew his lesson well and failed in no respect .

		Then all the pupils call < Diligent ' to him .

		When this has taken place his name is erased from the slate of lazy pupils , and the former transgression is for - given . ''

		Dock required his older pupils to carry on a weekly correspondence with pupils of like ability in another school , and of this plan , the pious , loving schoolmaster said : '' I doubt not , if two schoolmasters loving one another and desiring their pupils to love one another , were to do this in the love of God , it would bear fruit . ''

		With the unruly , the covetous , the vain , the over - ambitious , the dishonest , the untruthful , for each he had a different method .

		Experience had taught him , he said , that a timid child is harmed rather than benefitted by harsh words and a stupid child made worse .

		One driver , he continued , does not employ half the shouting , spurring , and whipping with his horses that another does , and yet takes a heavier burden over hill and dale .

		His minute rules of conduct also had their foundation in good judgment and also possess the interest derived from a portrayal of the customs of the colonial period .

		It was Dock 's daily habit to place the roll of his pupils before him and in private say a brief prayer for each one .

		One evening in the
autumn of 1771	DATE	he was found dead upon his knees in his schoolroom .

		His was a singularly sweet and unselfish character .

		His intelligence was of a rare degree of fineness .

		His writings possess a special interest for all who are engaged in edu - cational work , and they are , moreover , one of the foundation-stones of American culture .

		When her debts became pressing , she applied to the King ; and he , in order to put an effective brake on such expenditure , did not give her the money outright , but assigned some source of revenue which would bring the whole matter within the province of that shrewd and stubborn economist .

		Sully .

		M. Batiffol does not appear to think that in this attempt to protect the treasury from the inroads of Queen
Marie	PERSON	's de - mands the King was moved altogether by reasons of state , for he caustically remarks that
Henry	ORGANIZATION	preferred to save his ready money for his mis - tresses .

		Although
Marie de Medicis	PERSON	is the principal subject of
M. Batiffol	ORGANIZATION	's volume , the author makes no attempt to give a complete view of her character , for his descriptions of her court do not go beyond
1617	DATE	, the year of her loss of political power .

		He intimates that adversity developed the less agreeable elements of her character , as her sudden elevation to authority in
1610	DATE	had brought out qualities of application to affairs of state which none had discovered during the life of Henry IV .

		Her character , as it is revealed gradually in successive chapters on the '' Queen 's Day , '' the '' Queen 's Household , '' '' Palace Life , '' etc. , is not attractive .

		Interest in her is aroused by the account of the tedious marriage negotiations which left her uncertain of her fate until she was twenty-seven years old .

		This sympathy is weakened by a process of attri - tion , as in the course of the narrative several qualities appear , one after another , which are obviously unamiable .

		According to the author , she possessed '' a nature meagrely endowed with heart or brains . ''

		She was so obstinate that the
King	PERSON	, being angered one day by the
Dauphin	LOCATION	's willfulness , said to
Marie	PERSON	, '' Knowing your dis - position , and foreseeing what like will be that of your son -- yours ,
Madame	LOCATION	, obstinate , not to say stubborn , and his opinionated -- I am as - sured there shall be trouble between you , '' -- a prophecy ,
M. Batiffol	PERSON	adds , only too well ful - filled .

		Her other qualities
M. Batiffol	PERSON	sums up in the remark , '' The impression to be derived 168 THE DIAIL -LSB- Sept , 16 !

		, from considering the words and actions of
Marie de Medicis	PERSON	during the ten years of her residence in
France	LOCATION	is that of a woman not sure of herself , unstable , agitated , incapable of reasoning con - secutively and firmly -- frankly a character both mediocre and vacillating . ''

		But it would have required a person of remarkable self-control to put up with the affronts she endured , beginning with the
King	PERSON	's leaving her a few days after their marriage to hurry to the chateau of
Henriette d'Entraigues	PERSON	, and including as an incident the birth of a Due de
Verneuil	ORGANIZATION	within a short time , of the birth of the
Dauphin	LOCATION	.

		There is some curious information in the chapter on ' • The Queen 's Purse , '' showing how minutely the expenditure within her power was supervised .

		What the author says about the regulation of the royal expenditure in general might mislead the reader to suppose that there was a budget with something like the modern system of assignment of appropriations .

		Among the minor characters described in the volume is the Queen 's friend ,
Leonora Galiga'i	PERSON	, with her peculiarities , her love of money , and her nervous ailments .

		Perhaps the most attractive chapter in the book describes the relations of the Queen and her children .

		Even if she may be accused of lack of self-control in other respects , in this she never was betrayed into inordinate sentiment .

		M. Batiffol is , however , not quite consistent with himself in describing her characteristics as a mother .

		Her scheme of discipline was one of rewards and punishments , toys and whippings .

		She ordered Louis XIII .

		whipped even after he moimted the throne .

		When , immediately after this punishment , he entered her apartments and she rose as etiquette demanded , he made the pointed remark , child though he was , '' I would be better pleased with less obeisance and less whipping . ''

		The author 's aim in writing this book was not so much to produce diverting descriptions and tell interesting tales as to contribute a study of a phase of French society .

		He has achieved his purpose within the somewhat narrow limits of the subject , although the study will be read perhaps more for its lighter interest than for its historical value .

		One of his judgments is cer - tainly open to criticism .

		This questions the integrity of Sully ,
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's great minister of finance .

		The tendency of accredited opinion seems to be the other way , for investigation has shown that Sully owed his fortune chiefly to the gifts of a grateful monarch .

		Briefs on New Books .

		Popular account ^ ^ ■ ■ ^ ' `` •
Keane	PERSON	is already well of the peoples known to all who are interested m of the earth .

		^ j ^ g gtu -LRB- jy of the races of man through two of his earlier works -- '' Ethnology '' and '' Man , Past and Present . ''

		Both books are now standard works of reference , and must be at the hand of every student in their field .

		While many opinions ex - pressed in them fail to gain assent , and the dogmatic style of the author arouses a feeling of belligerency on the part of a well-informed reader , they have proved most stimulating , and by their copious refer - ence to original authorities have done much to foster a true spirit of research .

		In his more recent work on `` The World 's Peoples '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Dr.
Keane	PERSON	aims to present his material in a more popular form , and , omitting all references and footnotes , to make a work which shall appeal to a wider circle of readers . ''

		The World 's Peoples '' is , he says , '' a popular accoimt of their bodily and mental charac - ters , beliefs , traditions , political and social institu - tions . ''

		The book will no doubt prove useful , although in the nature of things it is less satisfactory to the student than the others mentioned .

		It neces - sarily repeats the material contained in them , but is diluted and '' written down '' to the popular mind .

		There is no new matter except a little drawn from works published since his earlier works were printed .

		Much that was in them is here omitted , as being `` debatable questions . ''

		The author says : `` This book therefore deals , not with faint probabilities , but with established facts . ''

		After this statement one must be somewhat surprised at some of the assertions .

		Why can we locate the human cradle '' with some certainty in the
Eastern Archipelago	LOCATION	and more particularly in the island of
Java	LOCATION	'' ?

		Surely ,
Dubois	PERSON	's discovery at
Trinil	ORGANIZATION	is not warrant for such location : it would not be , even if Pithecanthropus erectus were as ancient as was at first claimed .

		We make no polygenistic argument , but surely Dr.
Keane	PERSON	's presentation against it , on his opening page , is absurd and unfair in that it constructs a man of straw and fails absolutely to present the views of any competent polygenist .

		What does Dr.
Keane	PERSON	mean by saying that there are no terms for numerals beyond 2 or 3 in
Australia	LOCATION	?

		Conant presents such .

		What does Dr.
Keane	PERSON	mean by saying that
Philip	PERSON	- pine negritos `` neither keep slaves themselves nor endure the yoke of servitude '' ?

		Neither part of the statement is true .

		These may seem small matters , but they must be noticed when they occur in a book which claims to present only established facts .

		Unfortunately , such mis-statements are ex - tremely common .

		There are some points in method , too , that demand mention .

		We regret that Dr.
Keane	PERSON	here adopts the ill-advised term Amerind .

		There are no new reasons in favor of its use , and it is surely not gaining ground in
America	LOCATION	.

		The only apparent reason why he uses it is that he has read Dellenbaugh recently .

		So , too , it is a Httle late to
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 emphasize
Powell	PERSON	's termination - an for linguistic family names , and to extend its use .

		American students were for a time subservient in the matter , but Dr.
Keane	PERSON	must know that present tendency is away from the Powellian rule .

		As for the term JPuebloan , so far as we know original in scientific writing with Dr.
Keane	PERSON	, we deplore it .

		In spite of its defects , the book is readable , well illustrated , and in some respects a convenient manual .

		Such a work is needed , and is particularly difficult to produce .

		Most recent efforts in this direction have not been particularly happy .

		The last great book of the kind was
Peschel	PERSON	's : would that someone in this generation would give us one as good !

		Newipaper articles worth reprinting .

		Editorials written for the daily press are commonly so ephemeral in char - acter , so partisan in tone , or so local and restricted in interest , that they would not well stand the test of republication in book form .

		Many of the editorials reprinted in Mr.
Fabian Franklin	PERSON	's `` People and Problems '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- treat of issues no longer living ; but there is enough of present interest in the book to give it life as a whole , while every page is marked by a style so little '' journalistic '' as to make the entire volume attractive - Four papers of a more weiglity character precede these brief edi - torials : they are three public addresses -LRB- `` Newspapers and Exact Thinking , '' `` James
Joseph Sylvester	PERSON	, '' and '' A Defect of Public Discussion in
America	LOCATION	'' -RRB- , and an article on `` The Intellectual Powers of Women '' contributed to `` The North American Review . ''

		The author shows himself to have read with approval
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	on the woman ques - tion , and he takes occasion to make an apt quotation from him .

		Mr.
Franklin	PERSON	's early devotion to math - ematics , of which he was at one time professor at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, has left its good results in the exactness and restraint of his literary style .

		Let us quote a sentence from his opening chapter . ''

		The fact is , '' he declares , '' when it comes to our desires and prejudices , it goes against the grain to say we do n't know ; and if we are unwilling to say that , we are not in the attitude of the scientific man , and we are not likely to do exact thinking . ''

		The editorials , it may be well to state , are republished from '' The
Baltimore	LOCATION	News , '' of which Mr.
Franklin	PERSON	assumed the editorship in
1895	DATE	, leaving the
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	mathematical professorship to enter on this other work , so vastly different in character .

		The Iliad of the
East	LOCATION	, 1 in English .

		The oriental and the occidental tem - per are so widely different , notwith - standing all assertions and arguments to the contrary , that the literature of
India	LOCATION	will probably never be thoroughly popular with us .

		Gems from the Sanskrit poets are now and again imported from
Asia	LOCATION	, provided with a European setting , and offered for sale in the Western market ; but still the demand for these wares remains comparatively small .

		Miss
Frederika Macdonald	PERSON	has done every - thing possible to make attractive her selections from the ''
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	'' in a volume which she entitle.s `` The Iliad of the East '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , and which Mr.
J. Lockwood Kipling	PERSON	has illustrated in his well - known manner .

		The book is essentially a reprint , as the introduction explains .

		It was thirty-eight years ago that
Miss Macdonald	PERSON	first published these selected episodes from
Valmiki	ORGANIZATION	's great poem . ''

		The book represents , '' she writes , '' no scholarly effort to reproduce the original Sanskrit text literally , but only a nosegay of stories gathered in the course of my own explorations of the ` immense flowering forest of
Valmiki	ORGANIZATION	' as it was thrown open to an un - learned reader like myself in the admirable French translation of
Hippolyte Fauche	PERSON	. ''

		Miss
Macdonald	PERSON	calls her book , somewhat surprisingly , '' the only attempt ever made to invite English readers with no exclusive knowledge of Indian literature -LSB- are there any English readers with such exclusive knowledge ? -RSB-

		to acquaint themselves with the peculiar charm and perfume , and with the senti - mental temper so akin to their own , which pervade this old story-land . ''

		The Brahman compilers and editors of the poem have commended it in terms that , if taken literally , leave no doubt of its merits .

		The attentive reader of it '' shall be delivered from sin ... He shall have sons if he desire sons ; he shall have riches if he long for riches ... The young girl who desires a husband shall obtain this husband to delight her soul ... Those who in the world listen to this poem , composed by Valmiki himself , shall acquire every gift , the object of their desire , just as they may have wished . ''

		Mr -
Kipling	ORGANIZATION	's bas-reliefs , photographically reproduced , are curiously and skilfully wrought ; but , to para - phrase Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, the wonder is , not that the book-illustrator has done his work so well , but rather that he should be able , with the limitations and restrictions he has imposed upon himself , to & o it at all .

		On the track ^ ^ ' ' ^ ' ^ '
Hammerton	PERSON	, the enam - of
Stevenson	PERSON	oured Stevensonian and compiler of in
Old France	LOCATION	. '' '

		Stevensoniana , '' has been moved by his love for ''
R. L. S.	PERSON	'' to go forth in search of material for another somewhat similar volume , which he entitles '' In the Track of
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	, and Elsewhere in Old
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Those diverting and original travel sketches , '' An Inland Voyage '' and `` Travels with a Donkey , '' dear to every
Stevenson	PERSON	lover , however unenthusiastic over narratives in general of that class , gave Mr.
Ham	PERSON	- merton his itinerary , ready-made ; and with zeal and manifest delight he has traced his hero 's course from village to village and from one humble wayside inn to another .

		Writing of the Trappist monastery of Our Lady of the Snows , which
Stevenson	PERSON	confesses that he approached with `` unaffected terror , '' his faithful follower has this interesting passage : '' The library , which occupies a spacious room on the upper story of the north wing , is stocked with some twenty thousand volumes , chiefly in
Latin	LOCATION	and French , but including an excellent collection of works in
Greek	LOCATION	, J70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, religion and history being naturally the chief subjects represented .

		When we remember that many of the monks are men of no great intellectual gifts and of small learning , being drawn largely from the peasant class and the military , we may doubt if the treasures of the library are in great request .

		The librarian , at least , must be a man of bookish tastes , since the collection is arranged in perfect order .

		Our guide assured us that the monastery possesses a copy of Travels with a Donkey , but he did not discover it for us . ''

		Only think of the quiet , preserved without police intervention , in a Trappist library !

		Surely , the conditions for reading and study there are unsur - passed , -- but the readers and students are wanting .

		Chapters on the country of the
Camisards	LOCATION	, the town of the immortal `` Tartarin '' -LRB- Tarascon -RRB- , `` Round about a French Fair , '' and other agreeable topics , supplement the Stevensonian travels .

		The hillside village of Pradelles has suggested to the author a new word , '' slanternness , '' expressive but not strictly needed .

		Ninety-two clear illustrations from photo - graphs help one to follow the author in his devious but interesting course .

		The history of the printed book , SeprSd iooA .

		* ^ o ™ * ^ `` obscure beginnings of rock - marking and tally-stick notching , up through the parchment roll to the neat and service - able and inexpensive product of our great modern book-making establishments , has been compendi - ously and at the same time interestingly traced by the master-hand of Mr.
Cyril Davenport	PERSON	in a handy volume entitled '' The Book : Its History and De - velopment '' -LRB- Van Nostrand -RRB- .

		Illustrations , many in number and sometimes curious in character , help to tell the story of the book 's gradual evolution .

		Minute details of paper-making , binding , engraving , decorating , and other subsidiary and ancillary arts , are not wanting , all set forth with a fulness of knowledge and a diligence of research that are most praiseworthy .

		The bibliography -LRB- `` Books to Con - sult '' -RRB- appended to each chapter enables the student to pursue considerably further any branch of the general subject that may especially interest him ; and it incidentally reminds the reader that Mr.
Davenport	PERSON	is a somewhat prolific author in this his chosen field .

		Let us cull one item of information , probably new to ninety-nine readers out of a hun - dred .

		How can we account for the great length -LRB- sixteen and seventeen feet , and even more -RRB- of ancient vellum rolls in one continuous strip ?

		Not even the longest-necked giraffe would furnish such a stretch of skin all in one piece .

		Mr.
Davenport	PERSON	teUs us that he '' consulted a clever leather worker and gave him a skin measuring about 3 feet by 2 , suggesting certain ways of cutting it .

		He produced eventually , by wetting , pulling , and pinning , a beau - tiful roll of nearly 4 inches in breadth and 16 feet 9 inches in length . ''

		On an early page the writer says , rather imaccountably , that `` the modern en - graving of inscriptions on metal has mainly found refuge in monumental brasses , and in this case the A doubtful Hero of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		letterings are usually run in with some pigment '' -- as if inscriptions on silver , gold , bronze , copper , steel , and brass too , were not common enough , with - out any pigment filling .

		It is difficult to see how Miss
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	's biography of Charles the Bold came to have a place in the `` Heroes of the Nations '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The rash Duke was scarcely a hero , and , as the author correctly informs us , '' he never had any nation , great or small , at his back .

		Personally he was a man with - out a country . ''

		The explanation in the preface , that the admission of Charles to this gi'oup '' is justified by his relation to events , '' scarcely meets this objec - tion .

		But this is , after all , a minor matter .

		The important thing is that
Miss Putnam	LOCATION	has given us an interesting account of a most interesting career .

		The biography contains little that is new : we are still in the dark as to why Charles failed to get the royal crown at the meeting with the Emperor at Treves ; and there are other questions relating to the policies and diplomacy of the time that still remain unan - swered .

		But the story is told with a freshness that suggests a close study of primary sources and a mastery of available historic materials .

		The person - alities of Philip the Good , Charles the Bold , and
Louis	LOCATION	XL stand out clearly and prominently ; the complexities of the international situation in
the second half of the fifteenth century	DATE	are carefully traced ; and the difficulties that the Burgundian dukes had to contend with in their effort to unify their numerous and diverse possessions are brought out in a very satisfactory manner .

		The four closing chapters are devoted to the trouble with the Swiss and with
Lorraine	PERSON	, a difficulty which the author traces to a financial transaction of
1469	DATE	, in which Sigismund of
Austria	LOCATION	mortgaged certain Alsatian possessions to Charles ; the manner in which these were administered , rather than
Charles	PERSON	's ambitions with respect to the Alpine region , brought on the war with the mountaineers .

		The work is provided with numerous illustrations , all well executed and of true historic character .

		In addition it contains a fairly complete bibliography and a good map .

		In the last of his public addresses , Mr.
Bronson Howard	PERSON	, the late dean of our Amer - ican guild of dramatic craftsmen , spoke of a visit he had recently made to
Egypt	LOCATION	, and his memories of deserts and temples provided him with a metaphor , which he shaped into a prophecy , concerning the future -LRB- ► f the art to which he had given the best efforts of his long life .

		He spoke , in part , in the following words : '' This future temple of the drama also arises in a desert -- a dreary desert of English literature that covers the entire English-speaking world and stretches back more than half a century ; a desert of letters which has its own deceptions and optical illusions , making small men appear big and magnifying our great mien beyond their real greatness .

		It is a broad , flat desert of literary sage brush and scrub oak , with here and there a solitary mountain and a group of grand trees .

		But while there is in verity a temple arising in a place of desolation , I will venture on a cheerful prophecy .

		And mind you , even the weather reports are looked upon as prophecies .

		The brilliant indications shown by our younger writers for the stage who are now crowding to the front , eager , earnest , and persistent , with their eyes on the future and not the past , coming from every walk of life , from universities and all other sotirees of active thought , are the basis of my prophecy .

		It is this : In all human prob - ability the next great revival of literature in the English language will be in the theatre .

		The English-speaking world has been gasping for literary breath , and now we begin to feel a coming breeze .

		I may not live to fully enjoy it , but every man of my own age breathes the air more freely already .

		Let us hope that the drama of this century will yet redeem our desert of general literature .

		The waters of our
Nile	ORGANIZATION	are rising . ''

		That this view of the promised land is some - thing more than the vision of a dreamer , we feel reasonably assured .

		The signs are multi - plying in many quarters that the long drought is nearly over , and that the desert region of our literature is about to be redeemed .

		To believe that it would ever remain a desert would be to reject every analogy drawn from history or from the contemporary literary activity of other coun - tries ; it would be to despair of the human mind .

		For all the teaching of history is that the drama is one of the five or six types of literary expres - sion fundamental to mankind , and that the creative powers of genius achieve their most complete satisfaction when they conceive of men and women as moving and acting and speaking upon the stage .

		That this mode of expression 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, should permanently cease to command the ener - gies of some , at least , of the richest and most powerfid minds engaged in the production of literature in any important country is a propo - sition as nearly unthinkable as any that could be formulated .

		That the practical drama should have lapsed from literary standards for so long as it has done in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	is cause enough for wonder -LRB- although the reasons are fairly obvious -RRB- , but is no cause for surrender of our faith in its coming rehabilitation .

		It must be a question of time only , and we can not believe that the time will be long .

		It must not be forgotten that the
last century	DATE	, dark as it has been from the standpoint of well - wishers of the English theatre , has produced a memorable literature in dramatic form .

		That form has been used by
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	,
Landor	ORGANIZATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	, and many others .

		In fact , there are more of our greater poets who have used it than of those who have not .

		But , as we all know , most of them have used it in the '' closet '' way , without reference to the requirements of the real stage .

		They have given us everything of the drama but dramaturgy , and many of them would have given us that also had the public shown signs of encouraging them .

		The faculty that can create a dramatic action , and fit appro - priate words to the lips of the actors , has not been missing from English literature ; only the trick of technique has not been superadded , and this simply because there was no incentive for its acquisition .

		A public of which the most serious-minded section kept away from theatres altogether was not the sort of public to stimu - late a serious drama .

		We are well aware that there is a class of critics , devoted particularly to the drama , who are so enamored of technique that they will not admit a play unfit for the stage to be a play at all .

		They will doubtless take vehement excep - tion to the opinions above expressed , because they first give to dramatic technique the nar - rowest of definitions , and then upon that basis refuse admission into dramatic literature of all the works that do not conform to their defini - tion .

		But this is a quarrel about words merely .

		Because a work in dramatic form is not neatly divided into balanced and contrasted scenes , because its characters do not always make their entrances and exits in such a way as to produce certain momentary and artificial effects , because physical action is sometimes lost sight of in the development of ideas , because speeches are long and their language is not that of ordinary human intercourse , -- for these and similar reasons we are assured that many of the noblest dramas in our literature are not really plays , but only academic exercises of which their authors should feel rather ashamed .

		These authors , we are told , have been too indolent to master the rules of stagecraft , and have assumed an unjustifiably irresponsible attitude toward the form of art in which they affect to work .

		Now all this may be measurably true , and yet it does not weaken our contention that the '' closet drama '' includes many works which , despite their failure to move at the nimble gait most pleasing to our feverish public of theatre - goers , are capable of fulfilling for serious audi - tors all the deeper purposes of dramatic art .

		` The technique which they lack , and for lack of which they are so roundly condemned , is just what we have called it , a trick , a comparatively superficial thing , a quality that the dramatic writer will do well to cultivate , but one that must not be permitted to absorb either his own faculties , or those of his audience , to the exclu - sion of those weightier matters for which the drama ` really exists .

		The authors of these very works of which we are speaking might easily enough have fitted their dramatic productions for the stage had they seen any indications of the existence of a receptive public .

		But from a public that did not go beyond technique in its demands , that even resented the drama of ideas and serious purpose , they naturally felt them - selves estranged .

		And the estrangement will continue as long as the public maintains its philistine attitude toward the stage .

		The '' closet drama '' is the logical result of that state of the public mind which even yet is disposed to apply the contemptuous epithet '' problem plays '' to all the works that go below the glittering sur - face of human nature , or that venture to sub - stitute poetry for sordid prose in their portrayal of life .

		It is safe to say that when the public is ready to give up thinking of a play as a mechanism , and is ready to recognize it as an organism instead , that the long-delayed rapprochement between English literature and the stage will be at hand .

		The gods are ready to arrive when the half - gods are cast from their shrines .

		The cidt of the artificial and the insincere , as typified by the Scribes and Sardous , must give place to the worthier form of worship exemplified , however faultily still , by those who have come to know the sincere truth-seeking aims of such men as

		THE DIAL 199 Ecliegaray .

		Our examples are necessarily taken from foreign literatures because the English stage has so far lapsed from the path of drama - tic rectitude that it can offer only second-rate illustrations of even the inferior type .

		That regeneration of taste which alone can revive the past splendors of the English drama will come when enough people are brought to realize the simple fact that stares students of contemporary literature in the face , the fact that the English theatre stands alone among the theatres of the present-day world in its separation from reality and in its failure to give vital expression to the deeper thoughts and aspirations of the race .

		But there are signs of promise in the heavens , and the veteran playwright whose forecast has been taken as our text had his
Pisgah	LOCATION	- vision be - fore his eyes were closed .

		The Puritans frowned upon the stage , visiting their condemnation with - out discrimination upon good and bad alike , but their descendants are disposed to take a saner view and adopt a more liberal attitude .

		The church shows awakening sympathies and much softening of the old intolerance .

		Without the sympathy of the church , which in the old days saw in the drama the handmaid of religion , the outlook would be dark indeed .

		As Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	pointed out a year or so ago , the low estate into which our acting drama has fallen is largely due to the hostile attitude of the religious public , an attitude inherited from seventeenth - century puritanism .

		With the chief agency of public morality alienated from its cause , the theatre inevitably came to represent the frivol - ous , if not the actually degenerate classes of society .

		But now the more liberal element of church-goers offers an olive branch to the ancient foe , and we have recently seen the appearance of an Actors '
Church Alliance	ORGANIZATION	of national scope .

		Even in church circles of the severest standards there are signs of a new amity .

		Clergymen of imquestioned orthodoxy sometimes venture into the playhouse , and now and then bestow official sanction upon some play which exudes a suffi - cient amount of morality .

		These tentative efforts on the part of the clergy , despite their misplaced emphasis and their failure to make allowance for art in its proper sense , are never - theless encouraging , and are the first faltering steps toward a resumption of the cordial relations which are so greatly desirable .

		One swallow does not make a
summer	DATE	, and the winter of our dramatic discontent is likely to have its season prolonged for some time yet , but there is a clear harbinger of the coming
spring	DATE	in the extraordinary popular success of Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	's recent play .

		K a Work so gen - uinely artistic and at the same time so entirely wholesome as '' The Servant in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' can fill the playhouse for month after month with audiences that show every sign of being deeply moved by its gentle teaching , it is a pretty evident indication that a public already exists for work of a much more serious cast than that provided by our sordid syndicates .

		The public support that is slowly but surely bringing suc - cess to Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	's
Chicago	LOCATION	experi - ment in the higher drama , the practical interests that are soon to dedicate in
New York	LOCATION	a costly temple to sober dramatic art , the frequency with which good works are given special performances by our schools and universities , the marked de - velopment of student interest in dramatic liter - ature , the number of earnest young writers who are taking pen in hand with a fixed determina - tion to aid in the rehabilitation of that form of literature -- these are among the signs of the coming revival .

		We can not believe that a leaven working in so many ways will not soon have noticeable results , and will do much to justify the prophecy of the pioneer worker whose death we have lately been called upon to mourn .

		TOM HOOD AS A S ERIOUS POET .

		Posterity has not dealt justly with
Tom Hood	PERSON	.

		In an age when minor Jacobeans of not half his merit are dug up and sent out into the world of letters , Hood is known only as a fellow of infinite jest , now musty , and a maker of innumerable puns which are no longer amusing .

		To be sure , his serious poems are still read ; indeed , new editions frequently appear ; but Hood remains among '' those whom one should know about , '' not as a rival of
Tom Moore	PERSON	, not as a child of
Keats	PERSON	, but because he was the prince of punsters .

		Hood of '' The Comic Annual '' is dead for us .

		The light and airy wit that plays about the foibles of one generation loses its savor for the next .

		It is as alien as the fashions in illustrations of '' Punch '' or '' Life '' of twenty years back ; and , like them , it is grotesque .

		Hood the jester must go down the primrose path with
Tarleton	LOCATION	, with
Scogan	PERSON	, and all those lesser humorists who dealt in the main with surface only .

		For punning , like euphuism , has lost its virtue , and can never secure a lasting reputation .

		Nor is it profitable to consider those humanitarian poems which made him famous among the serious - minded of the community . ''

		The Song of the Shirt '' will hold its place in the anthologies , and `` The Bridge of Sighs , '' for all its word-juggling , will remain a great tour de force .

		Yet , in them Hood 's trade , to sound the humor of the town , and 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, Hood 's talent , to play with words , are more evident than the man 's real genius , a delicate flower at best , and , by the time these were written , nearly trampled out of him .

		One should not write of Hood without writing of his songs .

		But these deserve a special essay , and are not the matter for which we would challenge the readers who are content with the Hood of the anthologies .

		In defence of an attempt to bring a greater body of his verse back into the daylight , this might first be offered , -- that he wrote verse of a certain kind which was not done so well before his time , or after it ; and that , laboring in part in their lifetime , he wrote a few poems to be ranked with the verse of the masters of a particular art .

		These masters were
Keats	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		When the two Lake poets began the memorable venture of '' The Lyrical Ballads , '' it was the part of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	to reveal the beauty which lies in the weird , the supernatural , the regions at the borders of human experience .

		In '' Christabel '' and '' The Ancient Mariner '' he conveys , he suggests , by dic - tion and by metre , the tangible sensuous beauty of that which is intangible , unreal , and impossible .

		Byron 's blaze to
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's was a fierce lurid lamp - light to the intenser and clearer flame of alcohol .

		With
Keats	PERSON	the vision is renewed .

		In `` La Belle Dame sans Merci '' there is the same crystallization of strange suggestions into beautiful and sensuous words .

		The penumbra of the world is made visible and can be apprehended by the senses as the penumbra of the sun at the time of total eclipse .

		Nor is the other poetry of Keats deficient in this quality .

		No mystic shadows of the other world are thrown off from the great odes .

		Hot sunlight , the intense heat of passion , the glory of the visible world , surcharge their lines ; but the same principle prevails .

		Beauty is made sensuous ; beauty of sight and sound and touch is transmuted into beauty of words .

		The poet turns from the spectral forest and the fire-flags of the upper air to embalmed darkness , and the Attic shape with brede of marble men and maids .

		But the beauty , whether of the weird or the natural world , is always sensuous .

		Its mystery and intensity is to be felt , not merely to be conceived of .

		Exquisite sequences of vowel sounds , words rich in connotation , rhythm that stirs the fancy , -- all these bring upon the reader an enchant - ment of the senses identical with the spell cast by lovely seas , by wandering fires , by marble forms , or moonswept glades .

		This is the quality in which
Keats	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	are akin , and in which they excel .

		`` Natural magic , ''
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, from another point of view , would call it .

		But whether one regards the result , the purpose , or the means , its appearance as a principal aim in verse is enough to establish a school of poetry .

		Shakespeare and
Milton	PERSON	could make their lines become the thing described , but with them it was not the end and purpose of their work .

		Tennyson learned the art of
Keats	PERSON	, but he too made it subordinate to other ends .

		Like his early work , in which this quality is strongest , is the poetry of the pre-Raphaelites .

		Yet their verse at its best lacks the final perfection and the freshness of the masters .

		But Hood is a generation earlier .

		He belongs with
Keats	PERSON	and with
Coleridge	PERSON	them - selves .

		He comes upon the crest of the wave , and if he never reached the fagry lands at least he sailed the perilous seas of romance with the first naviga - tors .

		Though a disciple , it is as a pioneer also that he deserves to be studied .

		The poems which Hood wrote in the school of
Keats	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	were nearly all composed before
1829	DATE	.

		Up to that time he was known only as an author of sound , though restricted , fame , who served upon the staff of the old ''
London	LOCATION	Magazine '' with such men as
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	,
Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	,
Allan Cunningham	PERSON	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	, De Quincey , and
Lainb	LOCATION	, as fellow contributors .

		From his '' Literary Remin - iscences '' -LRB- which deserve to be better known -RRB- one discovers that he came under the personal influence of the great men who helped to make a new literary period .

		He knew
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	, and saw much of the latter .

		He may have known
Keats	PERSON	; for Mrs.
Hood	PERSON	was a sister of
Keats	PERSON	's friend Rey - nolds .

		Quotation , as well as imitation , show that at least he was steeped in his poetry .

		As a disciple , and also as a friend or acquaintance , he came into contact with most of the writers of the
Wordsworth	PERSON	-
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	group .

		The greater part of Hood 's serious work was done in the period of these friendships , when Lamb and he were still tramping country roads to sample tavern ales , while
Keats	PERSON	was alive , or only recently dead , and before
Coleridge	PERSON	had retired .

		But in
1830	DATE	he did his first comic annual , a compound of the humor - ous and a masterpiece of punning .

		The public laughed , were rewarded with more , and paid well for it .

		Not that Hood was commercialized .

		One could have as easily commercialized
Keats	PERSON	.

		No , -- he was married .

		The portrait of Mrs. Hood at the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	is very surprising ; she is so stiff , so aristocratic , so unemotional .

		One wonders to see thus presented the Fanny loved by Hood with a pas - sionate devotion as full of sentiment at the end as at the beginning .

		It was this marriage , seemingly , which made most of the trouble .

		For in
1834	DATE	busi - ness troubles involved the Hoods ; and the poet , refus - ing bankruptcy , went abroad where he might live cheaply and so save enough to support his family .

		Serious poems were not an asset of sufficient magni - tude to interest a creditor ; but the people labelled him prime humorist , and would buy his humor at sight .

		For many years he could afford to write nothing else ; and thus began the long struggle in which , worn out , he died .

		All this explains why we deal in the main with youthful work when we speak of the serious poems of
Thomas Hood	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps if
Keats	PERSON	had married Fanny Brawne when he first met her he would have returned to surgery and left us only '' Endymion '' and '' Calidore . ''

		The serious work of
Tom Hood	ORGANIZATION	for which one could ask a hearing is of three sorts .

		There are the romantic narratives and the odes of the school of
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201
Keats	PERSON	; there are poems of horror , fear , and mystery , in the Coleridgean art ; and finally come the ballads in the manner of '' Christabel '' and '' The Ancient Mariner . ''

		The most ambitious and the least successful of the poems of the first variety was '' The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies . ''

		There is a faint but peculiar charm in this poem .

		It is like
Italian Asti	ORGANIZATION	, delicate , memorable , a little weak , and a little cloying .

		One feels throughout the presence of a spirit too like the pleading Titania , whose arguments are not strong enough to save her realms from
Father Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is
Keats	PERSON	and
Spenser	PERSON	drained of their virility , although the poet is quite as careful of the beautiful words that stir the mind to dreams .

		The faults of youth mar other narrative poems of Hood 's , notably the better known `` Hero and Leander . ''

		But though not entirely free from them , it is difficult to see why '' Lycus the Centaur '' has been so completely for - gotten .

		Its theme alone should have saved it , for the story of the enchantments of
Circe	ORGANIZATION	is told in a strikingly original fashion .

		The tale could have been told severely with aU the horror implied , and so Landor might have written it ; but Hood chose a highly-colored narrative in which the shame of men turned brutes , the horror of Lycus wandering in a land where beasts and even fruit and flowers imprison woeful souls , his agony when his own spirit is chained to the loathsome body of a horse , all find expression and suggestion in rich verse .

		The poet is preemi - nently a lover of beautiful words ; and yet in spite of an occasional absurdity , he is no less a master of the pathos which lay behind his humor and crystal - lized in the humanitarian poems of his later life .

		A group of odes belong with these poems .

		The very titles , '' Ode on
Autumn	DATE	, '' '' Ode to Melancholy , '' `` Ode to the Moon , '' show the influence of
Keats	PERSON	.

		Less fervid than the master 's work , they strive for the same effects , but in Hood 's own way .

		The gentle melancholy of the '' Plea '' breathes through them .

		Ecstasy gives place to sadness .

		The rap - turous grasp upon beauty becomes a softer longing , as genuine but less intense .

		They are more re - strained than the narrative poems , more indicative of what the poor hack might have done if fate had let him .

		The deliberate richness of their phrase makes one sigh for a craftsman tirrned from such gold to a baser metal . ''

		Mother of light !

		how fairly dost thou go Over those hoary crests , divinely led !

		The '' Ode to Melancholy '' is less happy than this ode to the moon , whose ensuing verses are even more exquisite ; but '' Autumn '' is magnificent .

		It is a companion piece to
Keats	PERSON	's poem , and should so be read .

		Upon it alone one might base a claim for verse certainly as worthy as some of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's before the problems of the nineteenth century entered into his poetry .

		But when age had mel - lowed Hood , a barren decade of hack-labor had followed his inspiration .

		This diction is from his youth : ' ■ Where is the Dryad 's immortality ?

		Gone into mournful cypress and dark yew , Or wearing the long , gloomy winter through In the smooth holly 's green eternity . ''

		But horror and mystery can be conveyed by the suggestive power of words , as well as melancholy can . ''

		Lycus '' is a lament over wretchedness , a weird wretchedness like that of '' The Ancient Mariner . ''

		In two or three other poems Hood passes over entirely into the manner which
Coleridge	PERSON	made his own ; and these pieces make up the second class of his serious poetry .

		One of these poems pleased
Browning	PERSON	, but has attained no other fame .

		In '' The Haunted House '' the horror is vague , the fear only suggested .

		Like Shelley 's `` Sensitive Plant , '' the piece is only a description .

		The tragedy must be apprehended from the house which conceals it , as the romance of
Venice	LOCATION	from a painting of
Turner 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over a ruin hangs the mystery of the
Bloody Hand	ORGANIZATION	which appears on tattered banners , on curtains , and on broken casements .

		Not a tumbled coping-stone , not a wood-louse , spider , or moth , within the cor - roded walls , but is drawn upon for its share of suggested decay .

		And at proper intervals comes the refrain , '' O'er all there hung the shadow of a fear . ''

		The fashion of telling is Hood 's , for the poem is late ; but the power of the story is in its metre and in its diction , and these most resemble the style of '' The Ancient Mariner . ''

		Yet there is no servile imitation in this poem , nor in the almost famous '' Dream of
Eugene Aram	PERSON	'' which belongs with it .

		Tom Hood is strongly original in both ; but the mantle of
Coleridge	PERSON	has fallen upon his shoulders .

		He is imitative mainly in the endeavor to transmute the feeling of mystery and of fear , and of deeds terribly done , into sound and picturing word .

		Agony of conscience drives
Eugene Aram	PERSON	to tell a schoolboy a pretended dream which is a true recital of his murder of an old man . ''

		And lo !

		the universal air Seemed lit with ghastly flame ; Ten thousand thousand dreadful eyes Were looking down in blame : I took the dead man by his hand , And called upon his name ! ''

		`` The Ancient Mariner '' achieves its peculiar effects by like cunning of words and metre .

		But few men have been able to give a better example than Hood in '' Aram '' of the proper relation between pupil and master .

		The imitation is of methods and of purpose , more than of diction , metre , or thought .

		The inspiration is not so much borrowed as shared .

		A critic of Hood , in '' The
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review '' of
April , 1846	DATE	, remarked that '' he could throw himself back into the romance of the past , but his home was naturally among the realities of the present . ''

		The present of
1846	DATE	has long gone by , and with it most of the work of the poet which dealt with topics current in that day .

		Of his '' con - temporary problem '' poetry , only '' The Song of the Shirt '' has lasted .

		But there is at least one poem of `` the romance of the past '' which is likely to 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, endure . ''

		Fair Ines '' is one of several attempts in his third or ballad manner , the manner of '' Christabel '' and '' La Belle Dame sans Merci . ''

		The verse which enshrines her is full of the quaint and exquisite charm of high romance .

		The very flower of romance is in such work , -- romance like that which
Scott	PERSON	conceived , but could give us only in the large , striving in broad strokes to achieve it by the very size of his canvas .

		In the poems of
Keats	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	, and to a less extent in these ballads of Hood , it finds an embodiment which may be likened to the masterpieces of the early Flemish painters , in whose pictures the mediaeval world is a vivid reality .

		Yet it may be likened to them only in the vividness of the impression gained ; for in these poems the glamor , seen only by a modern , hangs over the picture .

		One looks at the past as at
Tintern Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, without reflection , without thorough compre - hension , yet stirred by the romance of its memories .

		Perhaps no one but a grim realist will deny this power to the best poems of the masters .

		But Hood too saw the vision .

		Hood shared the * ' wild sur - mise '' of the first moderns to stare upon the for - gotten middle ages through the haze of romance .

		He also , in his minor way , could bring down this romance from the ethereal and make it concrete . ''

		Fair Ines '' is surcharged with it . '

		• I saw thee , lovely Ines , Descend along the shore , With bands of noble gentlemen , And banners waved before . '' '

		One can not read this exquisite poem without a male - diction upon punning , and the fate that made its author devote such powers to the manufacture of comic annuals .

		It is this reflection which makes it difficult to estimate the value of
Tom Hood	LOCATION	's work ; for , after all , it was only half done .

		Hounded by misfortune and betrayed by the facility of his humor , he made himself famous , it seems , at the expense of becoming great .

		It is useless to guess what was Achilles ' name among the women , or what
Keats	PERSON	would have written had he lived ; but here is a minor
Keats	PERSON	whose ambition to leave great verse unto a little clan was not stout enough to endure .

		He had the ability to carry on the school of his masters .

		His humor would have saved him from the morbid sensuality which always threatened the pre-Raphaelites .

		His vigor , and the close relation which his life ever bore to the best thought of his time , might have impelled him from the parent source along a channel as orig - inal as
Tennyson 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		But this is pure speculation , and too much resembles an attempt to drag him from among the minor poets , where he belongs .

		The best service we can render
Tom Hood	LOCATION	is to rake back the ashes from the coals of live fire still glow - ing in his verse .

		Surely , for his own sake and for the sake of the school he wished to follow , the unhappy humorist deserves that the fate his own sonnet forebodes -- '' there may be then no resur - rection in the minds of men '' -- shall not be
Tom Hood	PERSON	's .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Misquotations of poetry , as has been remarked before in these columns , are too common to be noted , except in some peculiarly shocking cases by way of warning and example .

		Such an instance occurs in a recent number of that usually well-edited and always interesting
London	LOCATION	journal , '' The Nation , '' where -LRB- No. 20 , p. 707 -RRB- a poetically-minded contrib - utor presents an amusing and amazing sheaf of short quotations from standard English poetry , chosen to illustrate his notion -LRB- a somewhat fanciful one , it would appear -RRB- of passages '' most descriptive of vari - ous personal or social conditions . ''

		It may seem presumptuous that anything emanating from the centre and stronghold of English culture should be challenged from this remote literary frontier , where -- as readers of English journals and books of travel are aware -- pig-sticking rather than literature is the usual pursuit of the inhabitants , and '' the ambushed Indian and the prowling bear '' are likely to be encountered anywhere outside the city limits .

		Yet we make bold to say that such a garbling of passages of well-known poetry as appears in this scholarly English journal is enough to abash the ambushed Indian , or make the pig-sticker blush for his literary heritage .

		In a couple of lines from one of Long - fellow 's most familiar poems , ' • The Rainy Day , '' we count seven words printed wrong -- seven out of fifteen I '' Surely we were never reminded better , '' remarks the contributor , '' of a hopelessly wet day . ''

		It was indeed a wet day -- for him !

		Perhaps in
Aberdeenshire	LOCATION	, from whence he writes , both the day and the quotation appeared through a mist of Scotch whiskey .

		And if he is a Scotchman , he should know his
Burns	PERSON	well enough to understand the difference between higs -LRB- ears -RRB- and lungs ; but he seemingly does not , or he would not change the line '' And through my lugs gies mony a twang '' to make the lungs the region of the poet 's toothache .

		A misprint of a single letter may be thought a trivial matter , -- but not when the line is from
Keats	PERSON	, whose '' beaded bubbles winking at the brim '' are changed to '' headed bubbles , '' as though the '' blushful Hippocrene '' had been transmuted into lager beer .

		And this , the col - lector fatuously explains , is one of '' the best quoted lines in the English language '' ; but in his hands it certainly seems one of the worst quoted .

		He does it again , to the same poet , in the opening line of '' The Eve of St.
Agnes	PERSON	, '' '' St.
Agnes	PERSON	' Eve , -- ah , bitter chill it was ! ''

		which is thus rendered by our connoisseur of poetic gems : '' At
Agnes Eve	PERSON	, and bitter chill it was . ''

		No T ^ onder he adds , '' Does not this make you shiver ? ''

		It does indeed .

Massachusetts	LOCATION	Laws , which was only recently discovered in
England	LOCATION	.

		The old - fashioned title is interesting : `` The Book of the General
Lawes	PERSON	and Libertys concerning the
Inhab	PERSON	- itants of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	collected out of the Records .

		Cambridge : Printed according to the Order of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	, and are to be solde at the shop of
Hezekiah Usher	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		1648 . ''

		His
New England Primers	ORGANIZATION	included four unique copies -- the
Boston	LOCATION	editions of
1735	DATE	,
1738	DATE	,
1746	DATE	, and
1762	DATE	-- and his Shakespeareana embraced fifteen different copies -LRB- that is , with variations in the im - print -RRB- of the four first folios .

		The first part of an illustrated and annotated catalogue of Mr.
Church	PERSON	's library has been prepared by Mr.
George W. Cole	PERSON	and published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Education by syndication is hardly to be ap - prehended ; there is not enough money in it .

		The
General Education Board	ORGANIZATION	, however , with its com - mand of
$ 43,000,000	MONEY	in funds , is in a position to exercise great influence on the character of Amer - ican education ; and it is both a gi'and and a peril - ous power for any one body of men to possess .

		Anything like centralization or monopoly in educa - tion is of course extremely undesirable ; anything that tends to supplant or diminish local enterprise and local pride in the matter of public education is to be dreaded .

		State rights and town rights are to be jealously guarded where culture is concerned , no less than in matters more material and tangible .

		Cheerful local support of good schools will cease if the people ever get the notion that a great educa - tional trust is looking after such interests and paying the bills .

		Already , in the very state of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, the board of trustees of the
Agricul	PERSON	- tural College at
Amherst	LOCATION	has been directed by the legislature '' to use its best efforts to secure and accept for the college the benefit of the retiring fund of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the Advancement of Teachers . ''

		The opening of the school year moves to reflections and apprehensions , however full of promise and bright hope may be the general condi - tion of our educational system .

		• • • The blind poet of
Maryland	LOCATION	, the Rev.
John Banister Tabb	PERSON	of
St. Charles 's College	ORGANIZATION	at
EUicott City	LOCATION	, the '' Father ''
Tabb	PERSON	so well known for his pithy bits of verse in many of the leading periodi - cals , has , like
Milton	PERSON	, been stricken with blindness in the vigor of his manhood ; but , unlike
Milton	LOCATION	, he has no daughters to read to him and otherwise lighten the burden of his affliction .

		He writes that vision is nearly extinguished , but that he remains at the college for the present , not as a guest of honor , as his colleagues would fain have him do , but as a paying boarder , this arrangement being permitted only because he would seek another home if he could not have his way .

		The many who have found spiritual refreshment and intellectual delight in his crisply characteristic verse will , it is hoped , feel impelled to testify their appreciation by extending a helping hand to the stricken poet in his hour of need .

		Even a small offering from each of the un - known friends he has made could not fail to bring him cheer and comfort .

		Perhaps , too , the offerings had better be anonymous , to prevent their prompt return on the part of so sturdily independent a man .

		He is not , however , an object of charity ; rather has he made us his debtors .

		• • • The short story of action is no longer written , if one is to credit the doleful complaint of a promi - nent newspaper . ''

		It seems to be a rule of the cur - rent writers of short stories , '' runs the woeful lament , '' that nothing should be allowed to happen .

		There is page after page of words -- words like the sands of the sea or the drift of the desert , all the words that the dictionary contains and many besides , -- but 204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, that is all .

		Nothing done , nothing doing I The characters breathe , they think , but how seldom , oh , how seldom , they act ! ''

		The importance attached to action in fiction , by this writer , is like the import - ance given to it in oratory by
Demosthenes	LOCATION	; and , surely , in an era so full of action as ours , so rich in discoveries and inventions , so crowded with multi - farious callmgs and pastimes , it is strange that the story-writer should want for incident wherewith to enliven his tale .

		In the latest
London	LOCATION	directory some hundred or more new trades and professions are noted ; and the activities of men -LRB- and women -RRB- are increasing by a sort of geometrical progression .

		Why , then , this dearth of action in the short story ?

		May it not be because , after all , it is the old , old story of the heart and its affections that we are for - ever craving to hear retold ?

		Scenery and events , given the artist of genius , need never be elaborate or startling .

		There are but seven possible plots in fiction , it has been asserted ; but those seven plots , like the seven days of the week , contain infinite possibilities .

		The story of
Dickens	LOCATION	's first love is some - what fully told in a collection of the novelist 's letters now first made public , in a limited way , through the generosity of Mr.
William K. Bixby	PERSON	, the
St. Louis	LOCATION	bibliophile and collector .

		By Mr.
Bixby	PERSON	's kindness the members of the Bibliophile Society are in pos - session of the first and only printed copies of these inevitably interesting love-letters , which for three - quarters of a century have been hidden to the world , although the world has known of their existence from
Forster	PERSON	's '' Life of Dickens . ''

		The Dora of ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' and the Flora of '' Little Dorrit '' now prove to be Miss
Maria Beadnell	PERSON	, afterward Mrs.
Henry Winter	PERSON	, of real life .

		It is a little amusing , and thoroughly natural , to find the young lover writing to Maria in
1833	DATE	, less than three years before his marriage to
Catherine Hogarth	PERSON	: `` I never have loved and I never can love any human creature breathing but yourself . ''

		Twelve years passed before the coldly responsive maiden bestowed her virgin affections on
Henry Louis Winter	ORGANIZATION	, a business man in comfortable cir - cumstances .

		A preface to the letters has been writ - ten by Mr.
Henry H. Harper	PERSON	of the Society , and a critical analysis is contributed by Professor
George Pierce Baker	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	.

		• • • A CASE OF POETIC JUSTICE in our colonial history was surely the well-deserved fate that overtook General
Braddock	PERSON	in his foolishly conducted expe - dition across the Alleghanies against
Fort Duquesne	LOCATION	.

		After his supercilious rejection of the venerable
Franklin	PERSON	's advice in the matter of safeguarding his force against the Indians , his disregard of the warn - ings of his young but experienced staff-officer
George Washington	PERSON	, and his pompous assertion of the invincible superiority of British regulars , it seemed no more than right that he should have personal experience of the red man 's vigilance and cunning .

		But now , if we are to believe the plausi - ble story of Mr.
Albert Stewart	PERSON	of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Braddock	PERSON	was killed , not by the redskins , but by a white man of his own force .

		Mr.
Stewart	PERSON	's grand - father ,
Abram Stewart	PERSON	, was superintendent of the road travelled by
Braddock	PERSON	's army on that disastrous day ; and it was while the superintendent was directing some repairs on this highway , about eight miles east of
Uniontown	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, that there suddenly appeared from the bushes one
Thomas Fossett	PERSON	, a deer-hunter of local repute , who told the workmen that if they dug deeper they would unearth the body of General
Braddock	PERSON	.

		They digged , and found the body , which was later reburied near by , the grave being now marked with a tablet .

		The manner of the general 's death was then explained by
Fossett	PERSON	, who declared that he himself had shot his comman - der with his deer rifle .


Braddock	PERSON	, conceited and arrogant , ignorant of Indian tactics , and insisting upon marshalling his force in the open , had taken occasion to upbraid
Fossett	PERSON	, who , with his brother , was busily engaged in picking off the enemy from the shelter of trees , the regidars being thrown into confusion and bewilderment by the unfamiliar strat - egy of their foes .

		The unjust rebuke administered to
Fossett	PERSON	so angered him that he fired on
Braddock	PERSON	, and saw him fall , mortally wounded .

		This story , if true , is an interesting footnote to the history of our French and Indian wars .

		The pedantry of legax language both amuses and irritates the layman whenever he has occasion to wade through the verbiage of a legal document .

		What could be more pompously pleonastic than , for example , the terms of a lease whereby A. B. '' hath demised , granted , and leased , and by these presents doth demise , grant , and lease , unto C. D. , his exec - utors , administrators , and assigns , all that messuage and lot of ground situate , lying , and being '' within certain laboriously designated boundaries ?

		Let it be remembered , too , what an amount of impatience and harrowing suspense the circumlocutions of a man 's last will and testament are responsible for among his heirs-expectant , assembled to hear the reading of that formidable document .

		Instead of saying simply and directly , '' I give my old friend
Joe Appletree	PERSON	my Squirrel Hill wood-lot , '' the de - ceased , or his lawyer for him , has been obliged to write : '' As to my worldly estate , and all the prop - erty , real , personal , or mixed , of which I shall die seized and possessed , or to which I shall be entitled at the time of my decease , I devise , bequeath , and dispose thereof in the manner following to wit : , Unto my old and valued friend ,
Joseph Appletree	PERSON	, I give , devise , and bequeath `` the above-named wood - lot , so disguised in its opulence of legal jargon that honest
Joe	PERSON	is puzzled to determine whether he has fallen heir to a county or a cabbage-patch .

		Accuracy in language is one thing ; senseless redundancy is another .

		The reform in legal terminology that has begun in
France	LOCATION	might well extend to
England	LOCATION	and
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 206
America	LOCATION	.

		Such reform would go far toward remov - ing the ancient reproach that the law is mainly concerned with elucidating the obvious , proving the self-evident , and expatiating on the commonplace .

		• • • '' Baths before kooks '' is said to be the motto of Superintendent
Maxwell	PERSON	of the
New York City	LOCATION	public schools . ''

		As I draw books myself from a
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	library , '' he declares , '' and watch the children of the public schools go there for reading matter , I bless the great iron master for what he has done for the intellectual improvement and recreation of this city ; and yet the usefulness , from a moral and hygienic point of view , of the
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	libraries is small compared with the advantages that would flow from the benevolence of him who shall increase the number of public school baths . ''

		Perhaps it is well for the bookish person to be occasionally thus reminded that there are other m ` gent needs besides the intellectual ones , and that literature can bake no bread any more than can philosophy .

		Cleanli - ness , if it falls somewhat short of godliness , may be allowed to go ahead of book-learning .

		The frequent union , by the way , of bookworminess -LRB- if the term may be permitted for the sake of its expressiveness -RRB- and personal slovenliness is one of the less pleasing manifestations of the literary temperament -- one of the less encouraging outgro ^ \ ` ths or accompaniments , too , of the library habit .

		• • • The coast of
Bohemia	LOCATION	was , we believe , some time ago proved to be no such impossible region as modern geographers , in their pride of a fancied superiority to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, are fond of believing .

		Was it Sir
Edward Sullivan	PERSON	, or an earlier inquirer , who so happily discovered that under the rule of Ottocar the Second -LRB- 1255-1278 -RRB-
Bohemia	LOCATION	extended from the confines of
Bavaria	LOCATION	to
Raab	ORGANIZATION	in
Hungary	LOCATION	, and from the
Adriatic	LOCATION	to the
Baltic Sea	LOCATION	?

		As there is no reason whatever why Polixenes should be assumed to have reigned contemporarily with
Elizabeth	PERSON	, so there is no reason to refuse to the
Bohemia	LOCATION	of '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale '' the ample bounds of its thirteenth-century prosperity .

		Yet malicious allusions to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's '' Coast of
Bohemia	LOCATION	'' will probably be made to the end of time , so prone is frail human nature to strive for an easy eminence by demonstrating some minor inferiority in the great .

		It was a chance reference to this Bohemian question in our reading that prompted the foregoing protest against setting down Shakespeare as an ignoramus in geogi'aphy .

		• • • Stay-at-home travel , by the ever-popidar
Public Library Route	ORGANIZATION	, is inexpensive , does not interfere with one 's business or one 's family duties , offers a practically unlimited choice of itineraries , combines unexampled speed with absolute safety , and , for comfort , is incomparably the best known method of visiting all parts of the world .

		To be sure , it is not without some few disadvantages ; for example , consumptive patients visiting
Colorado	LOCATION	by this route are not likely to derive that benefit from the high and dry air of the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	which may be gained by one who travels by the
Union Pacific	ORGANIZATION	or the
Denver	LOCATION	and
Rio Grande	ORGANIZATION	.

		But there are stay-at-home cures for consumption , too ; or so we are assured every little while by the newspapers .

		The latest report of the
Galesburg	LOCATION	-LRB- 111 . -RRB-

		Public Library tells us that so fond are the Galesburgians of stay-at-home travelling that , while there has been an increase in circulation in every department of literature , the demand for books of travel in the past year has doubled .

		It wonld be interesting to know if a similar growth has been noted by other librarians .

		... Novel-reading and longevity stand in no very obvious relation to each other ; yet at the recent convention of the
English Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Brighton	LOCATION	, in a spirited discussion of the question how far public libraries should go in the purchase of current fiction , Sir
William Bailey	PERSON	of Manchester made bold to affirm , amid cries of incredulity , that the library authorities of his city very seldom found a novel that was objectionable , and even went so far as to declare his opinion that the reading of fiction prolonged the lives of many people .

		This assertion was gi'eeted with laughter , but it is not reported that anyone made the obvious and not especially original retort that the reading of our great mass of current novels does not really prolong life -- it only makes it seem longer .

		ALDRICH 'S `` COLLECTED '' POEMS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		May I , as the authorized biographer of the late
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, call attention to what seems to me a breach of publishing propriety in a volume entitled '' Poems of Thomas
Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, '' just issued ?

		This volume , which is announced by its publishers as '' a new collected edition , '' is composed of the contents of five of
Aldrich	PERSON	's first six volumes of verse , all written before he was thirty years old .

		It contains 152 pieces , of which 121 were discarded by the poet from his own collected editions , the '' Household '' and the '' Riverside , '' while of the 31 pieces that were retained by him , the text of many has been so thoroughly revised that the earlier and cruder forms are scarcely recognizable by those who have known them in later and legitimate editions .

		There are in
Aldrich	LOCATION	's collected Poetical Works 230 poems .

		There are , therefore , 199 of these , embodying the poet 's most mature and finest work , not to be foimd in this '' new collected edition , '' -- though the publishers have made amends for this deficiency by printing several pieces twice .

		The ethical question of the right of such a piece of book-making to masquerade as a `` new collected edition , '' I do not raise ; but as to the propriety of representing , without explanation or apology , the most fastidious of American poets by a compilation of his discarded juve - nilia , there can be , I think , no two minds .

Fifty Years of Music	ORGANIZATION	and Musicians .

		* '' I dedicate these memories to the ghosts , '' is the short but significant inscription preceding the '' Musical Memories '' of that veteran critic of music , and author of well-known books about music and musicians , Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	.

		The '' Memories '' relate to those stars , of vari - ous magnitudes , and now chiefly extinct , that were in their glory on the operatic stage and in the concert haU in the latter half of the nine - teenth century , and that cast some rays of their effulgence on the
Chicago	LOCATION	of that period .

		Mr.
Upton	PERSON	was for twenty-five years music critic , and later editorial writer , on the staff of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune . ''

		He has concerned him - self actively and intimately with the musical interests of the city , and has enjoyed more or less friendly relations with a host of famous musicians and singers and impresarios , from the time when , in the early fifties , he left his native
Boston	LOCATION	and cast in his lot with the prairie city so largely colonized by
Boston	LOCATION	people and built with
Boston	LOCATION	capital .

		From a rich collection of notes and records , concert programmes and newspaper notices , as well as from remembered conversations and events , he has written a book of unusual interest to those of his own com - munity , and hardly less attractive to music - lovers and readers generally .


Jenny Lind	PERSON	is the subject of his first chapter , and
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	figures in his closing pages ; while between these two there parades so splendid a pageant of musical genius that one is almost deceived into believing that
Chicago	LOCATION	, and not
Boston	LOCATION	or
New York	LOCATION	or
Cincinnati	LOCATION	or New Or - leans , was the music centre of
America	LOCATION	.

		Although
Jenny Lind	PERSON	never visited
Chicago	LOCATION	, notwithstanding assertions to the contrary , the author 's vivid recollections of her appearance at
Providence	LOCATION	, where he was then a freshman in
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, are graphically recorded . ''

		At
last the eventful night	TIME	came --
October 7 , 1850	DATE	, -- a red-letter date in memory .

		The usually staid city was in a state of delirium , which astonished those con - servative old families -- the Iveses ,
Browns	PERSON	,
Goddards	ORGANIZATION	, and
Hoppins	PERSON	.

		I can see it all now -- the crowds , the enthusiasm , the great audience inside , and the vastly greater crowd outside wishing it were inside .

		I see
Jenny Lind	PERSON	gliding down the stage with consummate grace , -- she never seemed to walk , -- amid the accla - mations of the audience ; a girlish figure of medium height , with fair hair and blue eyes , gowned in velvet , • Musical Memories .

		and wearmg a single rose in her hair .

		She was plain of feature , and yet her face was expressive and in a sense fascinating .

		It was a wholesome face .

		She may not have been beautiful , judged by the conventional beauty tests ; but if not extremely good-looking , she ' looked good , ' as some one has said .

		And that good - ness drew everyone to her , and she was '
Jenny	PERSON	' with everyone -- not
Signora Lind	PERSON	, or
Mademoiselle Lind	PERSON	, or Miss
Lind	PERSON	, but
Jenny Lind	PERSON	, as we say
Annie Gary	PERSON	or
Lilli Lehmann	PERSON	.

		Her voice , as I remember it , was of full volume and extraordinary range , and had a peculiar penetrating quality also , because of its puritj ' , which made its faintest tone clearly audible and enabled her to use exquisitely soft pianissunos .

		Her high notes were as clear aa a lark 's , and her full voice was rich and sonorous .

		Her singing was genial and sympathetic and marked by the fervor and devotional quality which characterized her nature .

		It evinced a noble musical endowment and great reverence for her art .

		She was little affected by adulation , but acknowledged the wild , frantic applause courteously and with evident pleasure . ''

		Reminiscences of the
Patti	PERSON	brothers and sisters , an extraordinarily gifted octette , afford matter for more than one chapter .

		Adelina , '' the most consummate and brilliant singer of her time , '' and '' unrivalled in roles requiring gmce , elegance , and ornate vocalization , '' Mr.
Upton	PERSON	did not become personally acquainted with ; but the following explanation of her success in resist - ing the ravages of time may be taken as author - itative . ''

		She apparently knew the secret of perpetual youth , for to the very last of her stage appearances she seemed to be the
Patti	PERSON	of the olden days , fresh , young , and charming .

		When she was sixty-four , she told a friend that up to the time she was forty she ate and drank what she pleased , but after that followed a stricter regime , never touching liqueurs or spirits , but limiting herself to white wine diluted with soda , eschewing heavy food , and sleeping with open windows but avoiding draughts .

		In this way she had preserved her youthful appearance .

		She had preserved her voice so long by her perfect Italian method and avoidance of exposure , and by never forcing it . ''

		It was from
Ole Bull	ORGANIZATION	, we are told , that Adelina learned the trick of farewelling .

		He was wont to give plain farewells , `` grand '' farewells , '' last '' farewells , '' absolutely last '' farewells , and '' positively last '' farewells , blithely reap - pearing the next season , until he bade farewell to earth and was seen no more .

		An occasional whimsical or humorous fancy is allowed by the writer to give variety to his narrative .

		After chronicling the death of Wieniawsky , the violinist , in poverty brought on by gambling , he continues : `` I have often wondered why it is that the violins gamble so frequently .

		I can not recall violas , ` cellos , or double-basses doing it .

		I am quite certain the trom - bone never loses money by chance , and that the bassoon , clarinet , and trumpet never take risks in any kind of game .

		But I know of several violinists who every now and then have * gone broke . '

		Is it because the violins
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 207 alone of the orchestral family have all the wild , way - ward , passionate work to do , and the other instruments have more staid , dignified , and conservative duties to perform ? ''


Rubinstein	PERSON	's piano-playing greatly impressed the author , who thought the famous musician best in concertos , where '' by his titanic power and impulsive force he not only made his piano take its proper place in the sea of sound , but he fairly led the orchestra in an authoritative man - ner .

		In a word , he dominated audience , players , and sometimes conductors . ''

		He was an artist who belonged to no school and left no school , but was a great musician playing
Rubinstein	PERSON	.

		Not exactly gratifying to national pride , but still not without a crumb of comfort , is the following : '' It is somewhat strange , considering his great suc - cess and the large remuneration he received , that he was dissatisfied with his American tour , with the busi - ness arrangements , and with piano-playing altogether .

		It is a little consoling , however , to know that he disliked
England	LOCATION	more than he did the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He once said in my hearing that Americans were too much en - grossed with the love of money to have a real love of art , but they were more impressionable than the English , who were the most unmusical people on earth .

		I have heard more than one eminent musician say the same thing .

		In one of his letters about this time he says : ' I put myself for a certain time at the entire disposition of the impresario , and may God preserve you from ever falling into such slavery .

		It is all over with art ; only the shop remains .

		You become an automatical instru - ment , and the dignity of the artist is lost . '

		Long after this tour he wrote to a friend : ' The whole time I was displeased with myself to such a degree that when a few years later another tour was proposed to me with the offer of fees amounting to half a million , I flatly refused . ' ''

		Jolly times in
Bohemia	LOCATION	mingle with the more serious and more professional remembrances of the journalist-critic .

		A night of mirth and merry-making is thus recalled : '' My pleasantest memory of
Christine Nilsson	PERSON	is con - nected with her birthday celebration at the
Sherman House	ORGANIZATION	in
Chicago	LOCATION	in
1871	DATE	, to which I have already made allusion .

		She was in the gayest of moods that evening , waived all the conventionalities , and showed herself a Bohemian of the most rollicking , sunshiny kind .


Verger	PERSON	sang musical caricatures of the leading barytones on the stage .

		Vieuxtemps sacrificed his high - art ideas to the humor of ' The Arkansas Traveller ' and the fascinations of ' Money Musk ' ;
Brignoli	PERSON	played his Battle
March	DATE	, which he thought was an inspiration , and was inclined to be offended when he looked round and saw the company , with
Nilsson	PERSON	in the lead , doing an extraordinary cake-walk to its rhythm , for
Brignoli	PERSON	took that march very seriously .


Nilsson	PERSON	gave some ludicrous imitations of the trombone , double-bass , tym - pani , and bassoon , and sang humorous songs .

		The closing act of the revelry , which lasted far into the small hours , was a travesty on the Garden Scene in '
Faust	PERSON	' by
Nilsson	PERSON	and
Brignoli	PERSON	, in which the big tenor 's gravity of mein and awkwardness of love-making was admirably set off by
Nilsson	PERSON	's volatile foolery .

		It was a night of hilarity and fun-making long to be remem - bered .

		And now I read that the once famous singer spent her sixty-fourth birthday in the Swedish village of Gardsby and delighted an enthusiastic audience with the song , ' I think I am just fourteen . '

		I should not be surprised if she honestly believes it , for she is one of the elect who can never grow old in spirit . ''


Theodore Thomas	PERSON	is of course a congenial theme to his old friend and authorized biog - rapher , even though that biographer can have little that is fresh and important to add to his earlier extended account of the great conductor .

		A puzzling bit of chronology arrests atten - tion for a moment .

		After writing that '' Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	had three failures in his life which were bitter disappointments and for which he was in no way responsible , '' Mr.
Upton	PERSON	says that '' one of these failures was the
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	scheme in
1893	DATE	, '' which is described ; and that '' Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's second failure was his adminis - tration of the
Cincinnati College of Music	ORGANIZATION	in
1880	DATE	'' ; and , finally , that '' Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's third failure was the
American Opera Company	ORGANIZATION	, organized in
1886	DATE	for the representation of opera in English by American artists '' -- an organization that went to pieces after two years of strenuous effort .

		However , there is scrip - tural precedent for causing the last to be first .

		Five of Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's twenty-two chapters treat more particularly of the history of musi - cal societies in
Chicago	LOCATION	, going back to the year
1833	DATE	, when '' the little village of six hundred residents , squatted among the sloughs near the mouth of the river , heard its first music in the strains of
Mark Beaubien	LOCATION	's fiddle . ''

		The author 's charter membership in and presidency of the
Apollo Club	ORGANIZATION	qualify him to write understand - ingly of
Chicago	LOCATION	's musical organizations .

		The subjoined paragraph , touching on a matter of recent musical and art history , is interesting for various reasons . ''

		The Studebaker Theatre is the home of English opera in
Chicago	LOCATION	, though the so-called grand operas have frequently been presented upon its stage .

		It is but one feature of the Fine Arts Building , and the Fine Arts Building is the accomplishment of Mr.
Charles C. Cur	PERSON	- tiss .

		It is a hive of busy workers in music , painting , sculpture , literature , and the arts and crafts .

		Its various cells house the theatre , the
Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	, the Assembly Hall , the Amateiu ''
Musical Club	ORGANIZATION	, the Woman 's Club , the
Fortnightly Club	ORGANIZATION	, the
Caxton Club	ORGANIZATION	, ' The Dial , ' ... and many other associations of an artistic character , and the studios of a small army of busy workers in beautiful things ... From roof to basement it is filled with what is somewhat tritely called ' the good , the true , and the beautiful , ' and no sordid or unclean things are allowed entrance .

		Though not a musician himself , Mr.
Curtiss	PERSON	is one of the charter members of the
Apollo Club	ORGANIZATION	, and was its first secretary .

		His whole life has been spent 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, in the advancement of art in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and he has had the satisfaction of living to witness the rich fruition of his lofty ideals and to enjoy the rewards of his honor - able struggle in the attachment of a host of friends and the success of his undertaking . ''

		The professional criticisms and judgments that sprinkle the pages of this veteran student and friend of music and musicians add to the value of his book .

		Few of his readers will have any memories of their own concerning a great number of the musical artists introduced , and we are thankful for the crisp and clean-cut char - acterizations of these departed celebrities .

		The style in which Mr.
Upton	PERSON	tells his interesting story makes it highly readable from beginning to end .

		It is most fortunate that he yielded to the solicitations of friends , and decided to pre - serve , '' in compact and accessible shape , '' these rich memories of his prime .

		More than fifty portraits , and views of the
Sauganash Tavern	LOCATION	and the old
Crosby Opera House	ORGANIZATION	, are included in the volume .

		• • XEARNESS TO -RSB- S `` ATURE '' IK ENGLISH liANDscAPE Painting .

		* Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's book on
Eichard Wilson	PERSON	-- sometimes called '' the father of English land - scape painting '' -- will be welcome to many : it is quite time something of the sort should have appeared .

		Hitherto this interesting artist has been little more than a name , or an appellation joined to the remembrance of a few pictures and a few anecdotes .

		And it has not been easy to find anything more , -- anything to be depended upon , one must add .

		The traditional view of
Wilson	PERSON	is that he was but one of the school of classical landscape dominant in his day .

		Thus , in so widely read a book as
Muther	PERSON	's `` Modem Painting '' it is said that ``
Wilson	PERSON	had the fixed idea that the Creator had only made Nature to serve as a framework for the
Grief of Niobe	ORGANIZATION	and as a vehicle for classical architecture . ''

		But such a view is so opposed to what little is common knowledge of
Wilson	PERSON	that no one could form a real idea of the man from it .

		It is a probable tradition that the figures in
Wilson	LOCATION	's pictures were sometimes painted by others .

		If this be the case , can we imagine a man painting only what he thought the framework , and leaving the real thing to another ?

		Again , it is one of the stock quotations from Sir
Joshua	PERSON	that
Wilson	PERSON	's pictures were too near common Nature to admit *
Richard Wilson	PERSON	, B. A. By
Beaumont Fletcher	PERSON	, niiistrated .

		New York ;
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		supernatural objects .

		We can hardly imagine that a man who had all of Claude to imitate should have spoilt his mythological pictures by having the framework too much like Nature .

		Such remarks , if not absurd -LRB- and of course many wiU not think they are -RRB- , are at least clearly conventional and not based upon the known facts .

		So in his later study of English landscape ,
Muther	PERSON	presents a different view : he sees some - thing more in
Wilson	LOCATION	.

		Of the Niobe he now writes : '' Here sighs and groans Nature her - self ... this is a picture which points , not backward to
Claude	PERSON	, but forward to Turner . ''

		So also Mr.
C. J. Holmes	PERSON	, writing in the '' Bur - lington Magazine '' a little while ago , says of
Wilson	PERSON	's `` View on the Wye '' that it might almost stand for '' a prelude to the revolt in favor of Nature which was completed by Con - stable '' ; and the same idea is suggested by other of
Wilson	PERSON	's later landscapes .

		With two such different views -- the traditional and the artistic -- it is certainly worth while for some - one to look carefully into the subject .

		The merit of Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's work will best come out if we consider his main contention ; for even though we may not agree with his final result , we shall learn something from his pre - sentation .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, so far from thinking of
Wilson	PERSON	as '' the English Claude , '' as the last petering-out of the classic landscape of
Claude	PERSON	and the Poussins , regards him as a virile origin - ator , as a forerunner , as one who before his time perceived beauties in Nature which others com - ing after him were more fortunate in exhibiting ; in a few words , as the father of English land - scape .

		I can not agree with him in this respect ; and although he has many sources of opinion not open to an amateur like myself , I believe it will be not impertinent to review the case .

		The revival of an interest in Nature was one of the marks of the eighteenth century in
England	LOCATION	, as elsewhere .

		It is to be seen in literature and in painting , in landscape gar - dening and in travel , -- indeed , in all possible forms of life .

		In
England	LOCATION	this interest in
Nature	ORGANIZATION	usually appeared in one of three forms .

		First , there was the charm of the beautiful par excellence ^ as it seemed , the large , free , well - proportioned , and elegant , well enough repre - sented in landscape art by the pictures of
Claude Lorraine	PERSON	.

		Then there was the charm of the romantic , of the wild , rough , fierce aspects of Nature that may be seen in the landscapes of
Salvator Rosa	PERSON	.

		And , lastly , there was the pleas - ant , comfortable , pastoral kind of charm , very
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 dear to the English heart , of which something is to be seen in
Ruysdael	LOCATION	and
Hobbema	LOCATION	.

		These different kinds of beauty will be found in all sorts of different forms ; perhaps the last is the most thoroughly English , and has remained the chief element in natural scenery that has ap - pealed to the English mind .

		However that be , there is little doubt that it represented the main feeling for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	during the eight - eenth century , -- '' the beauty of the grove and the shade , '' not classic nor romantic , but still charming and beautiful .

		As these three views of Nature came to expres - sion in the English painting of the eighteenth century , it is the classic landscape -LRB- if we may so call it -RRB- which is to be seen in
Wilson	LOCATION	.

		Whether he was or was not something more than the lover of classic landscape , as Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	thinks , he was certainly that .

		The second kind , the roman - tic landscape of
Salvator Rosa	PERSON	, is represented , in the eighteenth century at least , by no one .


Wilson	PERSON	has something of the quality , and the earlier pictures of
Gainsborough	PERSON	have something of it ; but of neither was it the prevailing spirit .

		A few poets and novelists loved the wild and horrid crag , the solemn and awful mountain ; but the painters cared less for them .

		For the third -- the pastoral beauty , the beauty of the grove and the shade , -- of course the man is
Gainsborough	LOCATION	.

		Now the prevailing spirit not only of the greatest landscape of the nineteenth century , but particularly of English landscape , has been , not the classic , and not the romantic either , but the charming , the familiar , the pastoral beauty .

		Take a few representatives : Constable and
Cotman	PERSON	,
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Monet	ORGANIZATION	, the Worpswede group in
Germany	LOCATION	, for instance , and
George Inness	PERSON	in our own country , -- these represent not such landscape as
Claude	PERSON	or Salvator , but something more like
Gainsborough	PERSON	.

		If you ask a landscape painter why he does not go into the mountains to paint , he will be likely to tell you that mountain crags are not paintable .

		If you ask him why he does not paint classic landscapes like
Turner	PERSON	's , he will tell you , possibly , that
Nature	ORGANIZATION	has not yet quite caught up to
Turner	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the beauty and the truth oi pay sage intime is felt by everyone , and is certainly the dominant spirit of English landscape , from
Crome	ORGANIZATION	, Cot - man , and Constable , down .

		And of such paint - ing , of such feeling for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	,
Gainsborough	PERSON	is without question the first great figure .

		It may be a superficial view , perhaps , but certainly a glance at '' Cornard Wood '' or '' The Water - ing Place '' will make one feel that
Gainsborough	PERSON	is distinctly modem .

		On the other hand , no picture of
Wilson	PERSON	's that I have seen will give one any such idea :
Wilson	PERSON	, like
Claude	PERSON	, has a very great and definite charm , but his feeling for landscape -- so far as concerns the spirit of it -- is not modern at all .

		Such , I presume , would be the contention of those who see in
Gainsborough	LOCATION	rather than
Wilson	PERSON	the father of English landscape ; and such a contention is doubtless entirely familiar to Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, for he bases his own opinion on very different views .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	, in the passage quoted , says that some of
Wilson	PERSON	's later pictures make one think of Constable .

		So they do ; not only the one which Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	men - tions particularly , but several others reproduced in Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's book .

		Indeed , many
Ameri	PERSON	- can readers , at least , in looking at the reproduc - tions of
Wilson	PERSON	's English landscapes will feel that they have not really known the man so far , that he had sides they were not aware of .

		The quality will strike any observer ; still , it seems but slight when we turn to
Gainsborough	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	presents a different view .

		He presents
Wilson	PERSON	's classicism in a very interesting way , and also the native quality of which we have just spoken .

		But when he calls
Wilson	PERSON	the father of English landscape , he has some - thing else in mind .

		He does not press the matter of dates , wherein
Wilson	PERSON	has the advan - tage , nor does he admit the importance of the spirit and sentiment , where he has not ; he takes another position . ''

		To see and feel was the great thing , and that was what
Wilson	PERSON	was the first ` landscapist to do . '' ''

		Even if it were true that he saw only
Italy	LOCATION	, he would still rightly be regarded as the artist with whom in
Britain	LOCATION	sincere landscape art may be said to have had its beginning . ''

		Closeness to Nature -- that was the thing in
Wilson	LOCATION	, thinks Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 167 , 168 -RRB- ; in
Wilson	LOCATION	to a degree in which it was not in
Gainsborough	LOCATION	.

		That is a point where I , at least , shall not venture to dispute with Mr.
Fleteher	PERSON	.

		Whether
Wilson	PERSON	or
Gainsborough	PERSON	were really closer to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, is a matter that I must leave to those who know their pictures more thoroughly , as well as the especial forms of Nature that they painted .


Wilson	PERSON	, according to Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, usually painted in his studio , and was even con - tent with a Stilton cheese and a pot of porter as a suggestion for one of his finest pictures .

		Now
Gainsborough	PERSON	, in his early years at
Ipswich	LOCATION	, said that he had painted every tree and every stile within ten miles around ; if , then ,
Wilson	PERSON	's pictures are closer to Nature than
Gainsborough	PERSON	's , 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, it will be admitted that he was a man of remark - able powers . ''

		His plains and mountains , and the very forms of his trees and tints of his ver - dure , are , far more than in
Gainsborough	LOCATION	, of the actual shape and substance of the same things in Nature . ''

		It may be so ; it is a matter of fact and not of inference , and in this country at least one can not really be a master of the materials for judgment .

		But on the basis of the material that does exist , such a view appears very eccentric .

		Such as it is , however , Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	practi - cally devotes his book to it ; and whether one agree or not , the book is interesting .

		He shows us
Wilson	PERSON	as a lover of classic landscape cer - tainly , but as distinctly a sincere , original painter , firmly intent on rendering Nature as he saw it .

		Unappreciated he was , of course ; but that very fact shows that he was not the follower of a fashionable tradition , but a man who was bound to see and paint for himself .

		That sort of criti - cism , and the twenty reproductions of
Wilson	PERSON	's pictures , are the chief things of interest in Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's book .

		The biographical part is slight , because there is very little material for it .

		But Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	has used what he could get , and has so thought over and appreciated
Wilson	PERSON	's painting that his book does much to give us some - thing of an idea of one who , whatever else he was or was not , was an artist of power and charm .

		The
Political Goal of Canada	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In an address before the
Canadian Club of Toronto	ORGANIZATION	, which forms the first of the series of addresses and essays in the volume entitled '' The Kingdom of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
John S. Ewart	PERSON	draws attention to the significance of the wide - spread movement for the creation of Canadian Clubs in all the cities and towns of the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.

		He says : ''
Canada	LOCATION	has commenced to realize herself , to believe in herself , and to recognize that for her , too , there is a principal part to play upon the stage of the world .


Canada	LOCATION	has become conscious of the feelings and aspi - rations and the strong strivings of strenuous manhood , and , on the other hand , of the utter impossibility of full expression and assertion in mere colonial status .

		Divine discontent -LRB- the necessary pre-condition of all improve - ment -RRB- , in regard to her political semi-servitude , has taken strong hold upon

		extreme expression to use in defining the present status of a country possessing the measure of self-government enjoyed by
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Neverthe - less there can be no doubt in the mind of any thoughtful observer as to the widespread discon - tent on the part of Canadians with their status as a part of the British Empire .


Canada	LOCATION	is ap - proaching , perhaps slowly but certainly surely , the parting of the ways .

		Self-respect will not permit her to remain satisfied with a union which savors of paternalism , however nominal the ob - noxious link may be , and however tactfully it may be hidden .

		But while there exists practical unanimity among thoughtful Canadians as to the impossi - bility of maintaining the status quo , there is a wide divergence of opinion as to the goal toward which
Canada	LOCATION	should set her face .

		Mr.
Ewart	PERSON	himself , in the last of these essays , '' The Future of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' suggests five possible alternatives : 1 , Union with the United States ; 2 , an inde - pendent republic ; 3 ,
Union	LOCATION	with the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	; 4 , an independent monarchy with a Canadian king ; and , 5 , an independent mon - archy with the same sovereign as the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		After arguing the probability or otherwise of Canadians accepting each of these alternatives , he rejects all but the fifth .

		Here is his own summary of the argument : '' The road of our political development has not led us away from monarchy , nor from the British Sovereign ; it has led us to almost complete independence -LSB- which , by the way , is hardly the same thing as '' political semi - servitude `` 3 ; the termination of the road is not far off , and it is the Kingdom of
Canada	LOCATION	imder the British Sov - ereign ; probably we shall not turn from that road to jom the
United States	LOCATION	; nor shall we become a republic by ourselves ;
Imperial Federation	ORGANIZATION	either in the lump or by instalments is impracticable and impossible . ''

		Mr.
Ewart	PERSON	argues his case with the skill and persuasiveness that one expects from one of the ablest members of the Canadian bar , but it is just in his point of view that one feels the weak - ness lies .

		His essays are not so much an impar - tial examination of the arguments for and against these several alternatives , and the probable atti - tude of Canadians toward them , as they are an argument in favor of one and against all the others .

		He holds , in fact , a brief for the
King	PERSON	- dom of
Canada	LOCATION	, as against the other alternatives , and particularly as against
Imperial Federation	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is open to question if the movement toward
Imperial Federation	ORGANIZATION	is anything like as dead in
Canada	LOCATION	, and in other parts of the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	, as Mr.
Ewart	PERSON	supposes .

		It might , in fact , be nearer the truth to say that ambitious young
Canada	LOCATION	-- young
Canada	LOCATION	that forms the back - bone of the movement that is finding expression
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 just now in the formation of scores of Canadian Clubs -- is divided into at least two camps .

		One of these , for which Mr.
Ewart	PERSON	may be accepted as spokesman , looks toward a British Empire composed of several nations owning allegiance to one and the same sovereign , but otherwise absolutely independent .

		The other , represented by Dr.
Parkin	PERSON	and Professor
Leacock	PERSON	, seeks to bring about a federation of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, which , while safeguarding the liberties and interests of each , will make it part and parcel of one vital and powerful whole .

		The former , in fact , stands for decentralization ; the latter for centraliza - tion .

		Apart from these two great schools of thought in
Canada	LOCATION	, there is a less clearly de - fined sentiment which might in time take form in a movement for the creation of an independ - ent Canadian republic .

		Finally , there is the party whose platform is annexation to the
United States	LOCATION	-- Dr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	.

		While there may , therefore , be diiferences of opinion as to the correctness of all Mr.
Ewart	PERSON	's conclusions , his essays may be taken as repre - sentative of the views of at least one strong and growing school of thought in
Canada	LOCATION	; and to that extent they are of distinct interest and value .

		From here , where North - erners and Southerners settled side by side along the banks of the great river on whose waters floated their commerce , the two most prominent leaders who stood for the perpetuity of the national union were chosen at a critical moment by the two great political parties ; and it is not strange that both of these leaders came from the state wherein the Northern and Southern ele - ments had been amalgamated most completely --

		A Study in
American Politics	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Allen Johnson	PERSON	.

		New York :
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		so far removed from the present that a true picture of him and his activities may be success - fully attempted .

		This attempt Professor
Johnson	PERSON	has made in his biography of
Douglas	LOCATION	; and it must be conceded that for the most part he has admirably succeeded .


Stephen A. Douglas	PERSON	was a politician of the type that flourished before the Civil War , and it is as such that the author has pictured him ; and this justifies the sub-title , '' A Study in American Politics . ''

		Yet the very limitation of the subject has led to omissions that prevent the study from being a complete picture of
Douglas	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	has not chosen to enter into his career as lawyer and judge except in the most casual manner , since these activities were so subordinated to
Douglas	PERSON	's political ca - reer ; and for the same reason we find little dis - cussion of his business enterprises -- such as his land speculations , etc. .

		It will be necessary to work out more carefully such phases of
Douglas	PERSON	's activities before the man will be presented to us in a final portrait .

		The description of the politician , however , is very satisfactory .

		The author has traced his career carefully through all available material , and for his painstaking study he is deserving of the highest praise .

		Private letters , the
Douglas	PERSON	autobiography , and the various public docu - ments , have been used with care and discrim - ination .

		Particularly to be commended is the treatment of
Douglas	PERSON	's promotion of
Western State	ORGANIZATION	building enterprises through the Commit - tee on Territories both in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	.

		Douglas was so closely identified with the slavery agitation that for this phase of his exertions he has not always received the credit that is due him .

		At an important epoch in the development of the West , in the year
1845	DATE	,
Douglas	PERSON	was appointed Chairman of the
House Committee on Territories	ORGANIZATION	.

		His work in this capacity is thus summarized by Professor Johnson : '' The vision which dazzled his imaginatioa was that of an ocean-bound republic ; to that manifest destiny he had dedicated his talents , not by any self-conscious surrender , but by the irresistible sweep of his imagina ^ tion , always impressed by things in the large and rein - forced by contact with actual western conditions .

		Finance , the tariff , and similar public questions of a technical natui'e , he was content to leave to others ; but those which directly concerned the making of a conti - nental republic he mastered with almost jealous eager - ness .

		He had now attained a position which for fourteen years was conceded to be indisputably his ; for no sooner had he entered the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	than he was made chairman of a similar committee .

		His career must be measured by the wisdom of his statesmanship in the peculiar problems which he was called upon to solve concerning 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, the public domain .

		In this sphere he laid claim to expert judgment ; from him , therefore , much was re - quired ; but it was the fate of nearly every territorial question to be bound up more or less intimately with the slavery question . ''

		In this estimate the author is correct .

		To
Douglas	PERSON	, the occupation of the public domain by settlers and the acquisition of new territory for the same purpose appeared the paramount issues of his time .

		The list of States and
Terri	PERSON	- tories for which he was sponsor is a long one , and the importance of his work may be shown by the fact that the list includes
Oregon	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	,
Nebraska	LOCATION	.

		Douglas 's attitude toward the slavery agita - tion is first to be explained by his interest in this Western expansion , and his political ambi - tion is a contributory cause .

		In every discussion concerning the formation of Territories or the admission of States , the slavery question was introduced .

		The South saw itself being out - stripped in the race of expansion , and demanded more than equal privileges , which the fanatic zeal of the abolitionists would take away entirely .

		This antagonism of purposes and policies forced the issue on the chairman of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	on Territories ; and his solution was that panacea with which his name is so closely associated -- '' Squatter Sovereignty . ''

		Such a solution must have appeared absurd to the men of the older communities of the
East	LOCATION	, but to the Westerners it seemed logical .

		As Professor
Johnson	PERSON	writes : '' The taproot from which squatter sovereignty grew and flourished was the instmctive attachment of the Western American to local government ; or , to put the matter conversely , his dislike of external authority ... Under stress of real or fancied wrongs , it was natural for settlers in these frontier regions to meet for joint protest , or , if the occasion were grave enough , to enter into political association , to resist encroachment upon what they felt to be their natural rights .

		Whenever thej felt called upon to justify their course , they did so in language that repeated , consciously or unconsciously , the theory of the social contract with which the political thought of the age was surcharged .

		In these frontier communities was born the political habit that manifested itself on successive frontiers of American advance across the continent , and that finally in the course of the slavery controversy found apt expression in the doctrine of squatter sovereignty '' -LRB- p. 161 -RRB- .

		In tracing out the development of this idea in national politics , and
Douglas	PERSON	's defense of it .

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	is particularly happy .

		There have been excellent treatments of the subject before ; but the personal element that is naturally so conspicuous in this narrative gives an added vividness to the discussion .

		Conspic - uous for its clearness and impartiality is the account of the Lincoln-Doiiglas Debate , wherein full justice is done to the better qualities of
Douglas	ORGANIZATION	's speeches .

		The '' Little Giant '' was , however , first of all a politician ; and Professor
Johnson	PERSON	fails to make a hero of him , nor does he try .

		His attempt is that of the true historian , the draw - ing of a faithful portrait ; and he does not seek to gloss over the weakness of his subject .

		In writing of the public indignation at the passing of the Kansas-Nebraska biU , he passes the fol - lowing just judgment : ''
Douglas	PERSON	was so constituted temperamentally that he both could not , and would not , confront the situation fairly and squarely .

		This want of sensitiveness to the force of ethical conviction stirring the masses is the most conspicuous and regrettable aspect of his state - craft .

		Personally ,
Douglas	PERSON	had a high sense of honor and duty ; in private affairs he was scrupulously honest ; and if at times he was shifty in politics , he played the game with quite as much fairness as those contemporary politicians who boasted of the integrity of their motives .

		He preferred to be frank ; he meant to deal justly by all men .

		Even so , he failed to understand the impell - ing power of those moral ideals which border on the unattainable ... His was the philosophy of the attain - able .

		Results that were approximately just and fair satisfied him '' -LRB- p. 270 -RRB- .

		Douglas 's failure to grasp the significance of the moral issue then dominating the North was the cause of his failure to maintain his leader - ship .

		Western expansion , whose long and force - ful advocacy was one of the most conspicuous events of his career , had become of secondary importance on account of the controversy over slavery to which that very expansion had given birth .

		So bitter had grown the feeling over slavery , that the nation itself was endangered ; and in the coming strife
Douglas	PERSON	was obliged finally to make a choice .

		His feeling for nation - alism , learned by him on the
Illinois	LOCATION	prairies , pointed out his course .

		He clung to the
Union	LOCATION	; but in this new issue , which he had so long - attempted to suppress , there was no place for his leadership .

		An almost unknown man had usurped his position in the
West	LOCATION	.

		The picture of
Douglas	PERSON	holding
Lincoln	PERSON	's hat at the inau - guration of his rival is symbolic of the new era in the life ' of the Republic .

		THE
DIAL 213 Recext Fiction	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The story to which Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	has given the simple but significant title '' Together '' is the strongest book that he has thus far written , and estab - lishes his title to a place in the front rank of our contemporary American novelists .

		It is a study of married life as it appears to a keen observer of our society , whose method is that of the realist , and whose sincerity is beyond question .

		The result of his observations is not pleasing , and he is certain to be dubbed `` cynic '' and `` pessimist '' by the outraged hosts of hypocrisy .

		We do not think that he deserves either ascription , although there is some touch of bit - terness in his treatment of the conjugal relation , and although the absence of any trace of humor makes gloomy reading of his book .

		But Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	is at heart an idealist of the passionate Ibsen type , and his surgery is founded upon the belief that the most debased society has within it a principle of self - regeneration .

		He has clearly voiced his own views through the lips of one of his minor characters , who thus comments upon our diseased modern life : '' Egotism is the pestilence of our day , -- the sort of base intellectual egotism that seeks to taste for the sake of tasting .

		Egotism is rampant .

		And worst of all it has corrupted the women , in whom should be
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's great conservative element .

		So our body social is rotten with intellectual egotism .

		Yes , I mean just what you have prided yourself on , -- Culture , Education , Individuality , Cleverness , -- ' lead - ing your own lives , ' Refinement , Experience , Development , call it what you will .

		-- it is the same , the inturning of the Spirit to cherish self .

		... So what have you made of mar - riage , ' leading your own lives ' ?

		You make marriage a sort of intelligent and intellectual prostitution -- and you develop divorce .

		The best among you -- those who will not marry unless the man can arouse their ' best selves ' -- will not bear children even then .

		And you think you have the right to choose again when your so-called souls have played you false the first time ... And now you know what I meant when I said that a neurasthenic world needed a new religion !

		... Not the old religion of abnegation , the impossible myths that come to us out of the pessimistic East , created for a relief , a soporific , a means of evasion , -- I do not mean that as re - ligion .

		But another faith , which abides in each one of us , if we look for it .

		We rise with it in the
morning	TIME	.

		It is a faith in life apart from our own personal fate .

		Because we live on the surface , we despair , we get sick .

		Look below into the sustaining depths beyond desire , beyond self , to the depths , -- and you will find it ... And as for beauty and satisfaction and significance , -- it is infinite in every moment of every life -- when the eyes are once open to see . ''

		It is not a philosophy of despair which is thus epito - mized ; still less is it a gospel of cynicism .

		But the author is vehement in his denunciation of the present-day conditions of American society , as re - vealed in the home , the mart , and the pleasance alike .

		He finds the root of most of the evils which he por - • ToQETHEB .

		trays in false ideals of married life , and these he embodies in a number of concrete examples , sub - jected to the most merciless analysis .

		One case , indeed , he gives us of a union which is fundamen - tally sane and happy , but it occupies only an incon - spicuous place upon his broad canvas .

		With this exception , married life , as Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	portrays it , appears as a failure , and his characters suffer ship - wreck as the consequence of their inconsiderate mat - ing , or of their absorption in sordid and vulgar ambitions .

		To what extent is his picture typical of the essential truth of our civilization -- this is the insistent question which his discussion puts before us .

		We think the view taken is too dark to be alto - gether just , although such examples as he provides are doubtless to be found in gi-eat numbers in our modern life .

		But the logical corrective of his posi - tion is supplied by one of his own paragraphs . ''

		Perfect justice , a complete picture of society in a civilization of eighty millions , requires many shades .

		The darker shades are true only of the rotting refuse , the scum of the whole .

		Among the married millions most are , fortunately , still struggling through the earlier types from the pioneer to the economist .

		But as the water runs there lies the sea beyond . ''

		It is , then , as a tendency rather than as a finality that this depiction of married life must be considered , and the social documents of the time certainly give us much corroborative evidence of the tendency toward which the novelist directs our attention .

		But it is not logi - cal to conclude that the future of
America	LOCATION	is with the alien races that pour themselves through Castle Gar - den .

		We still have as healthy a native stock as any that comes to us from abroad , and there is no reason to despair of a regeneration that shall
spring	DATE	from within our own organism .

		On the whole , Mr.
Her	PERSON	- rick 's indictment of our materialistic and pleasure - seeking society donne furieusement h penser ^ and is not to be quashed by the shallow platitudes of optim - ism .

		Such a study as his , holding the mirror up to the unlovely phases of our existence , and reflecting a searching light into the darker recesses of our national character , must make for good , since its truthfulness is undeniable , although it does not give us all the truth .

		The book has obvious faults .

		It lacks the virtue of reticence where that virtue is most needed , it is over-vehement in its exhortation , and its didactic zeal makes it miss the broad humanity of the highest fictive art .

		It is over-particular , and its very realism makes many of the characters -LRB- especially the men -RRB- unreal .

		But it is a strong and earnest book , ' wrought with conscientious skill , and its best passages achieve a marked degree of moral impressiveness , at times rise to an almost lyrical height of beauty .

		It is something of a relief to turn from `` To - gether , '' with all its merits , to a book like Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's ''
Peter	PERSON	, '' which affords reading of a less disquieting sort .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	is a senti - mental optimist by temperament , although he by no means ignores the sterner and ignobler aspects of life , and he chiefly delights in the depiction of lov - able characters .

		All the principal characters in 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, * '
Peter	PERSON	'' are lovable -- the bank teller whose name is the name of the book -LRB- although he is not its hero -RRB- , his sister
Felicia	PERSON	, the '' • gentleman journeyman tailor , ''
Isaac Cohen	PERSON	, who lives under the same roof , the sweet heroine , and the candid youth who loves and wins her .

		By way of contrast , there is only the hero 's uncle , who fleeces lambs in Wall Street , and is righteously made to cut his own fingers in the process .

		The hero , when he discovers the sources of his uncle 's wealth , is unwilling to accept from him either home or employment any longer , and bravely sets out to make his own way in the world -- a course which the end justifies , both practically and sentimentally .

		Once more the author finds in a novel the medium for setting forth the old-fashioned , simple , and gracious ideal of life which he has brought before our eyes many times before , an ideal in which manhood counts for more than money and breeding for more than worldly success .

		He affects -- like so many other novelists from
Thack	LOCATION	- eray down -- the confidential attitude toward his readers , and easily persuades them to his ways of thinking .

		This new story of his has both charm and fragrance ; if it does not reach very far into the depths of life , it at least shows us the surface in most alluring colors .

		Since Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has taken to writing novels about the lives of the idle rich , he has lost much of the charm which compelled us in his earlier books .

		There is little human interest in his new theme , and neither artificial sentiment nor smart dialogue is an acceptable substitute .

		It is true that his genuine feeling for nature -- the feeling of both naturalist and artist -- contrives to find some expression in these later inventions , and that saves them from absolute aridity .

		It is also true that he usually takes the precaution to give us a heroine who is superior to her moneyed environment , and a hero who is not handicapped by millions , and these are saving graces .

		But such books as `` The Younger Set , '' `` The Fighting Chance , '' and `` The Firing Line , '' are weak productions when considered as successors of '' Cardigan '' and ''
Lorraine	PERSON	. '' ''

		The Firing Line '' might as well have been called by any other name .

		It is the story of a young landscape gardener called to plan a park in
Florida	LOCATION	for a wealthy winter resident .

		The heroine is an adopted daughter of his employer , and the rest of the char - acters are irresponsible or mischief-making idlers .

		Some two years before the story opens , the heroine , learning of her nameless origin , and ashamed thereof , had rushed into a meaningless marriage , which naturally proves an impediment when the rightful lover appears .

		By this device the agony is drawn out for some hundreds of pages .

		Then the husband -LRB- who is one in name only -RRB- considerately commits suicide , and the story is brought to the inevitable end .

		The best thing about this rather cheap book is its semi-tropical setting , which is the author 's opportunity for a great deal of observant and loving description .

		The worst part of it is the slangy talk of most of the characters .

		What the
Governor of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	said to the
Governor of South Carolina	ORGANIZATION	upon a certain occasion has become a part of our national legend .

		What actually happened -LRB- if we may believe so veracious a historian as Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	-RRB- was that they trumped up a public quarrel as a sop to jour - nalism , and then quietly repaired to a secluded cabin in the woods , put on old clothes , supplied themselves with the necessary provisions , and went into a week 's session over the Great American Game -LRB- the one that is played with chips -RRB- .

		Among the cares of state which they thus temporarily escaped was the vexing problem of a notorious moonshiner , who asserted his inalienable rights in the border region of the two states , and was at the same time so useful as a vote - getter that each governor wished the other to deal with him .

		Now each of these governors had a daugh - ter , and each daughter an ardent pursuer in the shape of a lover at first sight -LRB- who , as we all know , is the most eager of all lovers in the romantic chase -RRB- .

		And these two girls , with the connivance of their respective swains , and not knowing what had be - come of their respective fathers , proceeded to get busy , taking the reins of government into their hands , and stirring up a very pretty border warfare between the two states , all with the object of cap - turing the aforementioned champion of the sacred right of making one 's own unlicensed whiskey .

		There results a comic opera situation that is ex - tremely amusing , and one exciting incident follows upon another until the helm of state gets back into the rightful hands .

		All this is told , in finely humorous vein , and with artistic deftness of touch , in '' The Little Brown Jug at
Kildare	LOCATION	, '' which we recommend as a sovereign specific for loathed melancholy or any other form of the blues .

		The American colonies have provided material for historical romances without number , and it is somewhat venturesome to add another to the list .

		The inventive faculty of Mr.
Henry Longan Stuart	PERSON	seems sufficient , however , to warrant him in making the venture , and his '' Weeping Cross '' is a story with qualities sufficiently distinctive to justify its existence .

		The narrative is in the memoir form .

		Its hero , an Irishman in training for the Jesuit priest - hood , fights for the King in the civil wars , is captured at
Worcester	LOCATION	, and sent by
Cromwell	PERSON	as a bondman to
New England	LOCATION	.

		He becomes the servant of a farmer at
Longmeadow	LOCATION	, and his master 's only daughter , a woman of passionate temper and tragic history , be - comes the controlling influence upon his life .

		His stormy wooing and other highly emotional matters occupy the story until near the close , when the couple flee into the forest , and are wedded by a friendly priest .

		Then the romance culminates with the his - torical massacre of
Longmeadow	LOCATION	, and in its sequel the woman is slain .

		It makes a vivid and robust tale , but its effectiveness is dulled by interminable passages of description and introspective analysis .

		Its extensive and rather dull moralizing makes it indeed , in considerable part , the '' unworldly tale '' promised by the title-page , but does not add to its
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 215 attractiveness .

		There is a distinct novelty , of course , in giving a Catholic hero to a story of puritan
New England	LOCATION	, but tradition has reported that two or three priests were concerned in the
Longmeadow	LOCATION	horror , and that a Catholic was known to he living in the town ass an indentured servant .

		This is the slender historical basis of Mr.
Stuart	PERSON	's invention .

		His title comes from
Montaigne	LOCATION	, who tells us that men who wed are likely to repent their bargain and come home by '' weeping crosse . ''

		Mr.
John Germain	PERSON	, a gentleman of fifty and the owner of extensive lands , was paying his annual visit to his clergyman brother , when '' An adventure of a sentimental kind presented itself to him , engaged him , carried him into mid-air upon a winged horse , and set him treading clouds and such-like filmy footing ... Blimtly , he , a widower of ten years ' standing , fell in love with a young person half his age , and of no estate at all -- but quite the contrary ; and , after an interval of time which he chose to ignore , applied himself earnestly to the practice of poetry .

		There ensued certain curious relationships be - tween quite ordinary people which justify me in calling my book a Comedy of Degrees . ''

		Thus Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, by way of introduction to his first novel of everyday folk and our prosaic modern life .

		No more primitive lovers for him , ranging in the enchanted forest , no more kings and queens of historical fame , no more eighteenth - century sentimental journeys or idyllic adventures on the road in
Italy	LOCATION	, but a story about people who wear ordinary clothes and whose speech is that to which our modern ears are daily accustomed .

		It is no small tribute to the author to say that his mas - tery of this prosaic material is as complete as was his mastery of the legendary and historical manners in which he worked before , that he has fitted his style to his theme with absolute nicety of adjustment .

		This modern reading of the tale of
King Cophetua	ORGANIZATION	and the beggar maid is a perfectly charming product of inventive fancy , instinct with the essential spirit of comedy -- by which we mean that there is no touch of the farcical about it , that it is rich in human feeling , and that the smile it brings to our lips is likely to find us close to the verge of tears .

		The pre - cipitation of tragedy which might so easily result from this mingling of the human elements of love and duty and instinctive feeling may cloud the medium for brief moments , but quickly disappears in the clarifying solvents of tender sympathy and illuminating intelligence .

		The story is , of course , one of an unhappy mating .

		The heroine is a nur - sery governess who is so dazed by the suit of her elderly lover that her natural impulses do not assert themselves until after she has taken the fatal step .

		Her lordly husband is so sunk in the gratified con - templation of his own magnanimity that it is long before he realizes that it is not love , but gratitude and respectful submission , that he has brought to his hearthstone .

		When the awakening comes , he broods in silence , and , dying , leaves a will with a sting , namely , a provision that his widow shall bene - fit by his estate '' so long as she remain chaste and unmarried . ''

		Yet he had been mistaken all the time in the object of his suspicions , for the young gentleman at whom the shaft is aimed had touched only the surface of the heroine 's life , and her deeper self had all the time been in the custody of a vaga - bond acquaintance unknown to her husband .

		This character , a gentleman by birth and education , abandons the flesh-pots of comfort for the free life of the open road .

		He takes a tent and goes gypsy - ing : he tinkers kettles for a material living , but has for his real object in life the planting of strange plants in odd corners of
England	LOCATION	, converting their bareness into spots of blossoming beauty .

		This interesting and sympathetic figure , this man whom
Thoreau	PERSON	would have taken to his heart , is the soul - mate of the heroine , and it is to him that she goes in the end , renouncing without a pang the life of luxurious ease that might yet be hers .

		The gypsy tent is the
Halfway House	ORGANIZATION	of her experimental ex - ploration of the world of men , and it becomes the haven of her final refuge .

		This outline can give no notion whatever of the exquisite charm with which the tale is told .

		It has all the seeming simplicity of the finest literary art , but its wit , its gi'ace , and its subtle sentiment are qualities that make of it a far more serious book than it pretends to be .

		In it Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	has achieved a new sort of distinction , and made to his readers a more human appeal than ever before .

Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		The palmy days ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ n years since Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	of the American
E. Hamblen	PERSON	's '' On Many Seas '' de - trading vessels , lighted readers of ocean adventure with its rapid and realistic account of the writer 's experiences on the briny deep .

		And now there comes another autobiographic narrative , of very similar tone and of equal interest , from the pen of Captain
John D. Whidden	PERSON	, entitled '' Ocean Life in the Old Sailing-Ship Days '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The same rough process of '' breaking-in '' as Mr.
Hamblen	PERSON	's was undergone by the cabin-boy Whid - den , when , at thirteen years of age , and an orphan , he went aboard the clipper '' Ariel '' at
Newburyport	LOCATION	and began a seafaring life that culminated in the captaincy of the barque '' Keystone , '' and included voyages to the far East and the far West and the Southern seas .

		The decline of our merchant ma - rine after the Civil War was the reason of
Captain Whidden	ORGANIZATION	's retirement , after a quarter-century 's ex - perience of seafaring .

		He deplores the war tariff which so raised the price of all shipping materials as to kill the
New England	LOCATION	ship-building industry .

		After reading the author 's prefatory announcement that he knows nothing of book-writing , having left school at twelve and applied himself to matters wholly unconnected with literature , one is agreeably surprised to find his stii ` ring narrative set forth in a fluent , clear , and pleasing style -- a style that is certainly well suited to his purpose .

		It is to be 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, noted that in the account of his
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	voyages Captain
Whidden	PERSON	has repeated the old and all but baseless tradition of Juggernaut sacrifices .

		As was made clear years ago by Sir
W. W. Hunter	PERSON	in his '' Statistical Account of
Bengal	LOCATION	, '' and more recently by
Moncure Conway	PERSON	in his book '' My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the
East	LOCATION	, '' this tradition is based on an error .

		Juggernaut , or
Jagannatha	LOCATION	, who is none other than Vishnu the Preserver , under another form , is of course opposed to the taking of life of any kind , and especially the self-sacrifice of human beings .

		Captain Whidden 's by no means puny pro- portions are partly presented in the frontispiece , and many other photogravures are scattered through the body of the book .

		As his old comrades would doubtless be glad to attest in his favor , the Captain spins a rattling good yarn , and we commend it to all lovers of sea stories .

		The deep interest taken nowadays ^ i ^ `` T / / ™ * in the decorative arts and in the ana craftsmen .

		i / ~ i < • modern Arts and Crafts movement , will ensure a welcome for Mrs.
Julia de Wolf Addison	PERSON	's '' Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For it is to the Middle Ages that the modern movement looks back for its in - spiration as to the golden age of handicraft .

		Then , nobody could be a cog in the machine , no matter how much he might have preferred it ; then , artist and artisan , designer and craftsman , were as a mat - ter of course one ; and this versatility , which often stretched itself to include half a dozen different artistic pursuits , if it thwarted cold perfection , im - pai ` ted a charm of sincerity , na'ivetS , and individ - uality , that the most wonderful machine-made product must forever lack .

		It is of some of the work pro- duced under these conditions , which a school of modern artists is trying to recreate , that Mrs.
Addison	PERSON	writes .

		Like her other art manuals , this one is intended for the amateur in such studies , who seeks the little general information that wiU make the collections in museums interesting and profitable , and lead to the reading of more detailed and comprehen - sive works .

		Accordingly there are brief and simple accounts of a dozen mediaeval crafts , practised ex - tensively in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, with explanations of mechanical processes , descrip - tions , often accompanied by illustrations , of distin - guished examples , and quaint legends and anecdotes of famous craftsworkers and their patrons , generally kings or ecclesiastical dignitaries , themselves often practical artisans , teachers of guilds , or directors of craft shops .

		Chapters of varying length are devoted to the different crafts -- metal work , including gold and silver work , that done in baser metals , and enameling ; tapestry ; embroidery ; sculpture in stone , limited to its decorative applications ; carving in wood and ivory ; inlay and mosaic ; and illumination .

		Each art is treated independently , though the names of workers like
Cellini	PERSON	and
Bishop Bernward of Hilde	ORGANIZATION	- sheim recur in different chapters ; and more or less chronologically , though the emphasis is not upon progressive stages of development but rather upon typical examples of work and workers .

		Necessarily , the accounts are frag ^ mentaiy , but they serve their purpose , and a short but well-chosen bibliography furnishes material for amplification in any desired direction .

		A week with ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Rosebery not long ago re -
Gladstone	PERSON	marked , the combination of bookish - at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		j ^ ggg g ^ ^ ^ j statesmanship illustrated by Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	is becoming rarer every year .

		The bookishness , if not the statesmanship , of the great man was displayed to admiring and respectful observers on the occasion of his last visit but one at
Oxford	LOCATION	, in
1890	DATE	, when , as honorary Fellow of All Souls , he was the guest of that college for a week in
January	DATE	and
February	DATE	.

		Letters descriptive of this notable event were written daily through the week by ''
C. R. L. F.	PERSON	, '' apparently the Warden of All Souls ; and some of these , with additions and notes , are now published under the title '' Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, 1890 '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		Monologue and dialogue is reproduced in some detail , and the little book gives glimpses of
Gladstone	PERSON	that one is thankful not to have missed .

		As to his manner in personal intercourse , we read : '' The charm of his talk can not be rendered in description -- the soft - ness of the lower tones of the voice , the easy con - stant movement as he turned from one to the other ; the clenched fist , the open palm , and the challeng - ing forefinger , which the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	knew so well .

		Sometimes he seemed to drop out of the conversation , his eye looked veiled and tired ; but at the first sound of a name that appealed to him , the veil seemed to lift , and he was watching the moment to speak . ''

		And of his appearance : '' All his portraits make him too fierce .

		There is great nobUity and play of face , as well as of gesture with the hands , which he is fond of bringing down plump on the table to emphasize a point ... Eyes grey - blue , and though occasionally they light up so much as to be describable as ' fierce , ' in ordinary conver - sation they are essentially mild , ''
Gladstone	PERSON	's inclination to discourse on Homer and on Greek archaeology appears to have bored his hearers a little , especially as they felt themselves not well prepared to contribute to the conversation .

		A number of the stories told by Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	are to be found in the '' Life , '' as is duly pointed out in footnotes .

		A portrait of the distinguished guest in academic gown faces the title-page ; another picture of him , with Mrs.
Gladstone	PERSON	standing at his side , is inserted later ; and we are favored with an outside view of the college rooms occupied by him during his visit .

		Something like a tobog - Pastimes of `` the old boys '' of
New Boston	LOCATION	.


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAl ^ 217 gan shute was occasionally erected to accentuate the already sharp descent at the beginning , and the speed attained was truly terrific .

		This and other sports and games that flourished on the Common when the nineteenth century was a hale and hearty sexagenarian are agreeably recalled and described by one who was a participant in them , Mr.
James D'Wolf Lovett	PERSON	, bis book bearing the title , `` Old Boston Boys and the Games they Played . ''

		The book had its genesis at a dinner given by the late
Samuel Cabot	PERSON	, himself one of `` the old boys , '' to a number of friends and contemporaries who had once been prominent oarsmen , cricketers , baseball and football players , boxers , gymnasts , or otherwise athletically distinguished .

		The memories there recalled , with the records and remembrances of Mr.
Lovett	PERSON	him - self , have been generously drawn upon to make a book of unique interest -- marred only by the modesty of the author , who was a ball-player and athlete of great prowess , but gives the reader only a hint here and there of his achievements .

		For the history of cricket , football , baseball , and rowing , Mr.
Lovett	PERSON	's chapters are of value ; and as giving a pic - ture of mid-nineteenth-century open-air pastimes in
Boston	LOCATION	, they are highly entertaining .

		Coming from one who assisted at the birth of our national game , and was himself a redoubtable pitcher , what is re - corded about baseball can not fail to find interested readers among present-day enthusiasts .

		One small error , or seeming error , noteworthy because so un - expected , may be mentioned .

		In commenting on the unvarying order of boys ' games , the year round , Mr.
Lovett	PERSON	makes marbles come after tops .

		Is it possible that the present cheerful sign of
spring	DATE	, the nimble marble , has not always made its appearance with the retreat of snow and mud ?

		The book 's many illustrations from old photographs form a valu - able part of its contents .

		Two drawings by Mr.
C. D. Gibson	PERSON	are also provided .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A French view ' ^ ^ ^ queer fascination that Beau of an English Brummell exercised in his lifetime 6mM and dandy , still ^ ij ^ gg ^ o his memory .

		Vain , shallow , impertinent , heartless , a spendthrift and a bully , he played his game of life with superb impu - dence and crafty abandon , making snobbery a sys - tem , insolence a fine art , and frivolity heroic .

		His genius was essentially un-English , -- one reason , no doubt , why he domineered so easily over the bril - liant , flippant , immoral society of his day , with its aspiration toward Gallic standards that it lacked the refinement fully to understand .

		It is not surprising , therefore , that this chief of the English beaux has had more than one French biographer .

		The latest of these is
M. Roger Boutet de Monvel	PERSON	, who has produced a delightfully picturesque and sympathetic study , etched on the background of contemporary English life .

		It is entitled `` Beau Brummell and His Times '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The prefatory history of dandyism in
Europe	LOCATION	is entertaining , and the trans - lation of the text is adequate , though at times rather self-conscious .

		M. de
Monvel	PERSON	has been particularly successful in selecting , from the mass of anecdotage available , bits that really illuminate his subject .

		Where an English biographer of to-day would have been likely to offer every item he could lay hands on ,
M. de Monvel	ORGANIZATION	has chosen to work on a smaller , better proportioned canvas , deftly avoiding too fa - miliar and too numerous instances of the Beau 's conspicuous traits , and not failing to bring out the less-known sides of his enigmatical character .

		His perfect understanding of himself and his methods , for example , is shown in his conversations with the eccentric Lady
Hester Stanhope	PERSON	, where he was clever enough to be as frank in his answers as she was direct in her attacks .

		And his real humor , his air of courtesy , and his gift for talking amiably with everybody , as the poet
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	bore witness to them , are not forgotten .

		The book is elegantly printed and bound , and is illustrated with portraits of the Beau and of some of his companions and admirers .

		The real
Francesca of Dante	ORGANIZATION	, In a neat little volume , Mr.
Harold Harris Mathew	PERSON	offers to English readers , through the press of
David Nutt	PERSON	, an adaptation of the work of
Monsieur Charles Yriarte on Francesca di Rimini	ORGANIZATION	.

		After a rather careful review of the evidence the author comes to this belief :
Francesca	PERSON	, daughter of the Lord of
Ravenna	LOCATION	, was about eighteen when , in
1275	DATE	, she was married by proxy to
Giovanni	PERSON	, who was over thirty .

		Her married life lasted ten years ; and she had one daughter .

		She was a woman `` of lofty spirit '' and resolute energy .

		Her intimacy with
Paolo	PERSON	was of long standing .

		Paolo 's main charac - teristic is summed up in `` II Bello . ''

		Six years before meeting
Francesca	PERSON	he had married ; and his wife had two children .

		Giovanni was the tradi - tional shrewd soldier-politician of the period , whose physical deformities did not interfere with his per - sistent activities .

		The day after he murdered his wife and brother he married one
Zambrasina	LOCATION	.

		So much for the probable verities .

		In the conclusion , however , this wise sentence is penned : '' But when all is said , it is useless to file our evidence , and search all possible sources of information to dis - cover the real
Francesca	PERSON	, for
Dante	ORGANIZATION	has superseded history . ''

		The book seems to us to serve its purpose well ; and its ninety-four small pages will do much to orientate the reader who is following the many and various writings that centre about
Dante	PERSON	's '' two sad spirits indivisible . ''

Oct. 1	DATE	, of characteristic whimsicality , form no unimportant part of the letters ; and , as was to be expected from this pioneer '' limerickian , '' he occasionally drops into that form of verse .

		As an example of his in - formal letter - writing style -- and it may be doubted whether he had any formal style -- let us quote a few lines disclaiming his intention ever to marry .

		* ' Single -- I may have few pleasures -- but married -- many risks and miseries are semi-certainly in waiting -- nor till the plot is played out can it be said that evils are not at hand .

		You say you are 30 , but I believe you are ever so much more .

		As for me I am 40 -- and some months : by the time I am 42 I shall regard the matter with 42de I hope . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 257 NOTES 257 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 258 HUMANISM IN EDUCATION .

		When Pope declared that '' The proper study of mankind is man , '' he formulated a maxim rather than a definite pedagogical prescription .

		But many of us , who have been wandering for a generation in the educational wilderness , find - ing its desert tracts more and more arid , its oases and refreshing springs less and less fre - quent , feel inclined to make the familiar quota - tion a sort of slogan in the warfare upon the Philistinism which at present prevails in our educational systems and institutions .

		It takes courage nowadays to make a bold stand for the humanities , because most people have the curious idea that education is chiefly desirable as a means of enabling young men to make money , and regard as a product of crack-brained fanat - icism the notion that its primary purpose is to enrich the individual with wealth of deepened sympathies , and the knowledge , cherished on its own account , that slowly ripens into wisdom .

		If there is any precept that needs to be im - pressed upon our practically-minded educators it is that they should take '' Good heed Lest , having spent for the work 's sake Six days , the man be left to make . ''

		If we turn to the poets , those unfailing sources of helpfulness in our need for guidance in the rightful ordering of life , and in the diffi - cult matter of learning what its realities are , we shall find no lack of wise counsel .

		Emerson , for example , will furnish us with this pithy fragment : '' There are two laws discrete Not reconciled , -- Law for man , and law for thing ; The last builds town and fleet .

		But it runs wild .

		And doth the man unking . ''

		Professor
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	makes the happy choice of this text for his recent volume of essays on '' Literature and the
American College	ORGANIZATION	, '' a volume which voices once more , and with singu - larly persuasive effect , the plea for things spiritual in our educational systems .

		He is one of those who realize how astonishingly bad a bargain it must be to gain the whole world and lose one 's own soul , and he gives us once more , reinforced by fresh illustrative material , the old 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, unanswerable argument for humanistic culture .

		He does not hesitate to suggest that the dilet - tante is a more admirable product of college training than the philologist . ''

		He is almost a dilettante -- he reads
Dante	PERSON	and Shakespeare , '' was the contemptuous way in which one of his philologist friends once described a colleague ; and Mr.
Babbitt	PERSON	does not shrink from accepting the challenge thus implied .

		He has noticed , he says , '' in philologists a curious predilection for vaudeville performances and light
summer	DATE	fic - tion , '' and even if the dilettante has '' given evidence of nothing except perhaps a gentle epicureanism , '' the pores of his perceptive con - sciousness have not been quite clogged up by pedantry .

		The scholar who couches a lance in the defence of humanism will find giants in his path , seem - ingly as terrible as the guardians of Doubting Castle in the allegory , and really , perhaps , quite as impotent to impede his progress .

		One of these educational monsters is the elective system , which is thus neatly disposed of : '' If some of our educational radicals have their way , the
A.B.	LOCATION	degree will mean merely that a man has ex - pended a certain number of units of intellectual energy on a list of elective studies that may range from boiler - making to Bulgarian ; the degree will simply serve to measure the amount and intensity of one 's intellectual current and the resistance overcome ; it will become , in short , a question of intellectual volts and amperes and ohms ... The rank of studies will finally be deter - mined , not by the number of intellectual foot-pounds they involve , but bj the nearness or remoteness of these studies to man , the boundaries of whose being by no means coincide with those of physical nature . ''

		Fortimately , there are signs that this particular form of educational foolishness is losing its in - fluence .

		It has weakened the fibre of a whole generation of young people , but its excesses have proved its undoing , and we are recovering some - thing of our lost sense of measure and relative values .

		The other monsters that the humanist has to confront are chiefly those which represent the two ideals of materialism and of pedantry .

		If left alone , they might destroy each other in time , for their objects are absolutely irreconcilable .

		But it is just as well to hasten the process of their dissolution by a few weU-directed lance thrusts .

		It requires only a slight infusion of rationality into the discussion to make clear that the ideal of money-getting and the ideal of knowledge-getting are alike empty , are alike unworthy of being thought the ultimate aims of education .

		There is to be found to-day in most of our colleges '' a literature ancient and modern controlled by a philological syndicate , a history dehumanized by the abuse of scientific method , and a political economy that has never been humane . ''

		This situation must be fairly faced , but it need not be the occasion for utter despair , because it is a situation so revolting to the deep instinctive sense of all who have the true inter - ests of humanity at heart that it may yield to a few resolute assaults .

		The fable of the one strong man who shattered the supports of the ancient temple of philistinism may sometime find its modern educational analogue .

		Neither Dryasdust nor the Spencerian utilitarian can escape from rout when humanism takes the field in earnest against them .

		History , philosophy , and the fine arts are the agencies whereby the highest educational results are reached .

		We do not undervalue the dis - cipline of natural science , but are compelled to consider its educational service as ancillary .

		As a preparation for bread-winning , it performs a serviceable function , but one that has little to do with education as we woidd define the term .

		But in its reaction upon the student 's envisagement of nature , and upon the modes of his thought concerning human life , it contributes to his training an important element .

		It helps him to weigh evidence , it deepens his devotion to truth , and it strengthens his understanding .

		It may add a new charm to natural beauty , it may enrich the aesthetic sense , and it may invest conduct with a deeper significance .

		But with all these ministries to its credit , it remains of secondary importance , educationally considered , because its primary concern is with things and not with men .

		In literature , on the other hand , all the humanistic agencies are at work , for it ignores nothing that concerns mankind as a spiritual being .

		Since the rays of light which constitute essential humanity -- rays intellectual , asstheti - cal , and ethical -- are thus focussed in litera - ture , it is obvious that literature , in a very broad sense , must be the chief concern of edu - cation .

		And this concern should determine the beginnings of education no less than its higher reaches .

		An admirable little book by Professor
John Harrington Cox	PERSON	on '' Literature in the Common Schools '' emphasizes this aspect of the question .

		`` The hunger to know the meaning of life is almost as primal as the hunger for food , '' this writer says ; and the all - comprehending character of literature , which makes it equally needful for young and old , is well expressed in the following sentences : `` Within its pages is to be found the deepest and truest revelation that the race has made of itself .

		Here

		THE DIAl .

		239 the seers of the world have recorded their flashes of insight .

		The answers of the universe to man 's fervid , persistent questionings are written here .

		The agony of the human soul in its endeavor to fathom the mysteries of existence is engraven on its pages .

		The intellect has ransacked every sphere , from the lowest to the empy - rean , to enrich its story .

		Its chief function is to lay bare the wisdom of the heart , purified of its dross by the masterful creative imagination of men . ''

		We can not begin too early to lay in the child 's mind those foundations of sympathy and un - derstanding which are to be the true life of the man when he is grown ; we can not take too great pains with our bricks and mortar in these beginnings of a structure that may in later years weigh heavily upon its base .

		That our schools first of all , and our colleges later on , are making a sorry mess of this busi - ness , is acknowledged by practically all com - petent judges .

		And this in spite of the fact , as Professor
John Erskine	PERSON	says in a recent article , that '' literature presents to the boy the most directly human subject matter in the cur - riculum , '' and that '' he will find that work and play coincide as nearly as may be in this crude world , when he sits down to read Fielding , or
Scott	LOCATION	, or Dickens . ''

		The trouble is that the boy is not encouraged to do this simple and joy - ful thing ; he is instead set to studying notes , and writing callow accounts of his impressions , and cramming for examinations .

		Better drop literature from school altogether than confine it in this straight - jacket of pedantry . ''

		Should not the first principle of teaching literature be to discover what prevents the life-loving youth from seeing the life stored up in these books as yet dead for him ?

		Should not the second prin - ciple be to remove that obstacle ?

		If there is a third principle , should it not be to see that the student reads as many books as possible ? ''

		To these pertinent questions of Mr.
Erskine	PERSON	the affirmative answer is the only one possible , in our way of thinking .

		Thus the teacher may be actively engaged in advancing that consummation so devoutly to be wished , in realizing that ideal condition phrased by Professor George Wood - berry , '' when the best that has anywhere been in the world shall be the portion of every man bom into it . ''

		A NEWLY-DISCOVERED manuscript of
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's has attracted attention , and its discoverer ,
M. Gustave Simon	PERSON	, who is also custodian of the Hugo manuscripts , is publishing a series of articles on it in
Les Annales Politiques	LOCATION	et Litteraires .

		This literary treasure trove -- if it shall prove to be a treasure -- is a preface to
Les Miserables	LOCATION	.

		That it has been deemed worthy of de - tailed treatment at
M. Sunon	ORGANIZATION	's hands seems to indicate that it contains matter of importance .

		SOME HI NDOO DRAMAS .


India	LOCATION	had what may properly be called a ro - mantic drama before any European nation .

		The Greek and Latin plays dealt , of course , with nature and humanity ; and all that concerns man and the world may be found in them , in germ at least .

		But they turned away by choice from some aspects of our common life .

		In tragedy , they held to high and stern themes ; in comedy , they dwelt on low and base ones , -- and they did not mix the two .

		The notes of the modern Romantic drama are , perhaps , chiefly these : the immense development of Love -- the love of man and maid -- as the central feature of the plot ; the increased use of natural scenery and phenomena toned in sympathy with the action or moods of the actors ; the admixture of tragedy and comedy throughout each work -- the ideal and the real walking arm in sirm , as it were ; and , finally , a loose , rambling texture of plot , defiant of the unities of time and place .

		These notes , sign alike of the work of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, of
Calderon	PERSON	, and of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, are all exactly anticipated in the Hindoo plays whose date may be anywhere from the beginning of our era to the year eight or nine hundred .

		The rise of the Hindoo drama seems to reverse the usual progress of an art form in any literature .

		As a rule , the sublime , the tragic , the irregular master comes first ; then the more perfect and mod - erate artist , and last of all the realist and comedian .

		But here the Menander-like author of `` The Little Clay Cart '' is the earliest ; and following him comes
Kalidasa	PERSON	, the maker of beautiful visions , soft , gentle , artistic ; while at the end , after the lapse of centuries , rises the great and appalling tragedian Bhavabhuti , the Hindoo ^ Eschylus .

		If
King Shudraka	PERSON	was the real as well as the reputed author of `` The Little Clay Cart , '' he must have had a liking for low life which would class him with the Sultan of '' The Arabian Nights . ''

		Cour - tesans , gamblers , thieves , cowherds , officers of the guard , and executioners , move across the scene .

		In variety and vigor of portrayal , in sheer vividness as of life itself , the play has no rival in ancient liter - ature , and is not surpassed by the best of its kind in Shakespeare or Goethe or Burns .

		There is the gam - bler
Samvahaka	PERSON	, who is pursued by two keepers of a gambling-house to whom he owes money , and who is rescued by another gambler .

		There is the thief
Savilaka	PERSON	, who breaks into a house with a dis - play of all the rules of his art and the procedures of logic .

		There are the officers of the guard , who quarrel with each other while they let Aryaka , the cowherd who is destined to be King , escape .

		All are depicted with the startling effect of truth which comes from the proper use of the exaggerations of art .

		To modern taste , the blot upon the piece is the profession of
Vasantasena	LOCATION	.

		She is a courtesan who has acquired an immense fortune , but has conceived a pure love for Charudatta , an unfortunate Brahman .

		240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Generally ,
Hindoo	PERSON	literature is as careful of the purity of its heroines as is English literature at its best .

		The woman with a past , the theme of three , have no place in their poetry .

		But there are two remarkable exceptions -- Draupadi , the heroine of the
Mahabharata	LOCATION	, who is married to the five
Pandu	LOCATION	brothers ; and
Vasantasena	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the case of the latter , though there is some pretty plain language addressed to her , and though her wealth and the sources of it are plainly indicated , we can shut our eyes to her bad repute .

		She is so beautiful , so gentle , so generous , and so devoted , and she passes through such an ordeal to win her love , that in the end she rises in our minds a sister to Imogen her - self .

		The play , indeed , has a haunting resemblance to '' Cymbeline '' in incident and character .

		The great figure of the piece -- Samsthanaka , the
King	PERSON	's brother-in-law , who persecutes
Vasantasena	PERSON	with his love and tries to do her to death -- is Cloten in a previous incarnation .

		There is not a mere family resemblance , as between many figures of fiction , but the characters are identical .

		If anything , the sweep and power of the creation is greater in the
Hindoo	PERSON	play .

		Vain , boastful , ignorant , cruel , cowardly , horrible , and deadly ,
Samsthanaka	PERSON	is a supreme triumph of dramatic projection , flawless from the first word he utters to the last .

		The deep feeling for natural scenery which char - acterizes Hindoo poetry beyond all the utterances of the
Romantic Muse	ORGANIZATION	, comes out in this play in two scenes , one of which describes a great storm of the rainy season , which sends
Vasantasena	ORGANIZATION	into
Charu	PERSON	- datta 's garden ; the other exhibits a public park where
Vasantasena	PERSON	is apparently done away with .

		In both cases the scenery is by way of contrast to the action , -- the dark approach and tumultuous dashing of the tropic rain driving the lovers into each other 's arms , and the grim murder of the girl being set against the smiling beauty of the garden .

		Another very famous scene of the play shows
Matreya	LOCATION	,
Charudatta	ORGANIZATION	's friend , led through the eight courts of
Vasantasena	ORGANIZATION	's palace .

		The scene is un - dramatic , but the glittering words in which the riches of the house are described add to the vivid - ness and lifelikeness of the whole play .

		In general , the conduct of the scenes , though often impossible to our ideas of theatrical effect , is essentially dra - matic .

		The interest is sustained and the suspense kept up to the final word .

		The unravelment in the last act is better handled than in most of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's comedies or romances .

		To sum up , the author of `` The Little Clay Cart '' was surpassed in verbal poetry , philosophy , and tragic situations , by
Kalidasa	PERSON	and Bhavabhuti ; but as a creator of character he is unrivalled in the Hindoo drama , and can lean across the centuries and shake hands with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was the luck of Kalidasa to be the first revealed of all the Hindoo poets to the Western world .

		The charm and perfection of '' Sakuntala '' got him the title of '' the Hindoo Shakespeare . ''

		To my mind ,
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	would be a closer comparison .

		Both are poets of aerial distances , of clouds , sunsets , forests , groves , caves .

		Their human beings are the embodiments of these things , and can hardly be separated from the natural phenomena amid which they move .

		A celestial ichor , rather than human blood , runs in the veins of
Kalidasa	ORGANIZATION	's per - sonages .

		These are gods , nymphs , heroes , hermits , and the like .

		They are dazzling , beautiful , tender , but homely human nature seems to have little part in them .

		They are all one family with the mountain heights , the clouds , groves , flowers , and animals , with which they have their home .

		The result is a debauch of beauty , an intoxication of the senses of vision , hearing , smell , but a woeful lack of heart - gripping , mind-thrilling passion .

		Even the tragic situations lose force because of their unreality or extra mundane quality .

		When
Dushyanta	ORGANIZATION	rejects
Sakuntala	LOCATION	, it is most like the separation of two clouds which the winds have driven apart .

		When the King takes arms at the command of Indra against the Demons , we do not believe in his warlike prowess , -- for how could Demons exist in such a soft and unnerved world ?

		Yet `` Sakuntala '' is the loveliest flower of the Hindoo drama .

		The play opens in a bold and strik - ing way .

		Dushyanta , an Indian King , is hunting in the lower slopes of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	, and , following a deer , has entered the precincts of a sacred grove .

		He sees
Sakuntala	PERSON	, the daughter of the hermitage , and falls in love with her .

		The ensuing scenes of the wooing are not wanting in humor , but their chief characteristics are the delicacies , the reserves , the mutual shyness , of the lovers .

		Love is never con - ceived by these southern poets as a bold flame , o'er - leaping bounds and sweeping everything before it .

		Finally , the
King	ORGANIZATION	and Sakuntala come to an under - standing ; and in the absence of her guardian , the sage Kanva , they are married by the Gandharva rite .

		But the
King	PERSON	has to return to his kingdom , and he departs leaving with Sakuntala a ring .

		Kanva arrives and approves the marriage ; but , unfor - tunately ,
Sakuntala	PERSON	has incurred the wrath of an irascible hermit who curses her and declares that her husband shall forget her .

		He relents so far as to allow that upon the sight of the ring of recognition remembrance shall return to
Dushyanta	LOCATION	.

		The greatly admired fourth act shows the departure of
Sakun	LOCATION	- tala from the hermitage .

		It is indeed a most tender and touching picture of girlhood breaking the ties that bind it to the only home which it has known .

		It is the most universal thing in
Kalidasa	LOCATION	.

		Sakun - tala goes from tree to tree , from flower to flower , and bids them farewell ; and she showers pet names and caresses upon the fawn she has raised , and the girl comrades who have grown up with her .

		The scene changes to
Dushyanta	ORGANIZATION	's palace .

		He is restless and melancholy , stricken with forgetfulness of the past , yet conscious that there has been a past .

		Sakuntala appears ; but , unfortunately , she has
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 lost the ring of recognition , and the
King	LOCATION	refuses to receive her as his wife .

		She is carried off into the air .

		Then the ring is recovered by a fisherman who finds it in a fish he has caught .

		It is brought to the
King	PERSON	, who recovers his memory and is plunged into grief .

		He is called away to lead the armies of Indra ; and finally , in the heaven of
Kasyapa	LOCATION	, he meets his son by
Sakuntala	LOCATION	, and is reconciled to his wife .

		There is not much strength or variety of characterization in the play .

		The hermits are fairly well discriminated , and there is one scene of low life between two constables and the fisherman which lends some relief to the poetry and phantasy of the work . ''

		Vikrami and Urvasi , ''
Kalidasa	PERSON	's other admitted play , is a slighter work than '' Sakuntala , '' but , if anything , is even more ethereally beautiful .

		Again the piece opens magnificently .

		The scene is upon a peak of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	.

		A bevy of
Apsarasaa	LOCATION	, Sky-nymphs , are grouped there , when
Kesin	PERSON	, one of the Demons , descends upon them and carries off Urvasi .

		Pururavas , an earthly king , enters , pur - sues the Demon , brings the nymph back , and falls in love with her .

		The scene changes to the garden of Pururavas .

		His friend , the buffoon of the piece , betrays to the Queen the secret of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's love .

		Urvasi enters unseen .

		She writes a letter on a leaf to
Pururavas	LOCATION	, and listens to his love raptures .

		He loses the letter , and it falls into the hands of the Queen , who confronts him with it and refuses him forgiveness .

		Urvasi falls under a curse , and loses her divine knowledge .

		Then there is a beautiful evening scene in the garden , when the Queen relents and gives the King permission to possess the nymph .

		The great act , however , is again the fourth .

		The lovers have retired from the city into the mountains .

		Urvasi unknowingly profanes a tabooed grove , and is changed into a vine .

		Pururavas wanders every - where searching for her .

		As , in the former play ,
Sakuntala	ORGANIZATION	's farewell to the trees and flowers amid which she has grown up is the deepest note struck , so here Pururavas 's appeal to all the animals in turn to aid him in finding
Urvasi	PERSON	is the strongest part of the play .

		At last he finds a ruby of transformation which changes the nymph back into her own shape .

		In the remainder of the play other complications ensue which form almost a new action .

		There is not enough opposition or resistance in
Kalidasa	LOCATION	's plays to make the dramatic fibre tense and strong .

		There is no shadow -- at most , only a white mist .

		As a consequence , the figures are not firm and definite ; they have not the body and movement of life .

		They are delicate , floating , atrial visions , infused with the sweetness and tender - ness of ideal sentiment .

		In Bhavabhuti , we descend unto the earth and move among human beings like ourselves .

		We de - scend further into gulfs and glooms that would have appalled
Kalidasa	PERSON	's soul . ''

		Malati and
Madhava	PERSON	'' has been called the eastern '' ■ Romeo and Juliet '' -- not so much from the characters of the lovers , who , like all Hindoo creations of that kind , are shy and timid in the extreme , given to the most roundabout declaration of their passion and to pining away on the slightest provocation , but because of some of the incidents which recall the English play .

		The plot relates the fortunes of two young persons in the ordinary rank of life whom
Kamandaki	PERSON	, a seeress , schemes to join together .

		Malati is carried off by a priest and priestess of the dread goddess
Durga	PERSON	, as a sacrifice .

		The scene of culminating horror is a field of dead bodies before the temple at
Durga	LOCATION	.

		Madhava enters with a drawn sword and a lump of human flesh , to propitiate the deity of the place .

		Within the temple ,
Malati	PERSON	, dressed as a sacrifice , is about to be offered up a victim by the priest and priestess .

		Madhava enters , rescues
Malati	PERSON	, fights with the priest and kills him .

		The priestess flies off , screaming vengeance .

		In greatness of conception and gloomy power of execution , the scene is not unworthy of comparison with that of Juliet awak - ing in the tomb .

		The last act of the play is a fit companion of the one described .

		Malati has been carried off again , and
Madhava	PERSON	and his friend wander in search of her amid the peaks and gulfs of the Vindhyan mountains .

		They are faint with hunger , and worn out with woe ; and after long utterances of hopeless grief ,
Madhava	PERSON	is about to jump into an abyss , when
Kamandaki	PERSON	appears with the garland he had given
Malati	PERSON	and the news that she is alive .

		There is a lively and natural sub-plot of another pair of lovers .

		The piece ends happily -- as do all Hindoo plays .

		The '' Latter Acts of Rama , '' Bhavabhuti 's other play , is a sequel to the great
Hindoo	PERSON	epic `` The
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	. ''


Sita	ORGANIZATION	, the lovely heroine of that poem , after the overthrow of
Ravana	LOCATION	, her abductor , goes through the ordeal of fire to satisfy her husband 's subjects as to her chastity .

		But this is not enough ; and when they revolt again ,
Rama	PERSON	cold-bloodedly puts her from him and orders her to be exposed in the
Dandaka	LOCATION	forest .

		Twelve years later , filled with remorse , he visits the forests and there encounters his two sons whom
Sita	ORGANIZATION	gave birth to in the early days of her exile .

		The situation and the characters of the two boys remind one of the sons of Cymbeline .

		The play is perhaps more remarkable for scenic splendor than for tragic depth .

		In the first act ,
Rama	PERSON	's brother exhibits to him a series of great wall-paintings depicting the main incidents of '' The
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Lava ,
Rama	PERSON	's son , makes war upon his father 's guax ` ds in a scene which must have taken a great deal of staging to produce .

		And in the last act ,
Rama	PERSON	's family and subjects are assembled in a great amphitheatre on the banks of the
Ganges	LOCATION	, and
Valmiki	PERSON	, the poet of the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	exhibits a play representing the sufferings of the exposed
Sita	ORGANIZATION	.

		The gods descend and declare her purity , and restore her to her husband . ''

		Ratnavali , the Necklace , '' is a charmingly told story of court intrigue .

		The heroine is a young princess who is found on a piece of wreck at sea , 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, with a diamond necklace upon her .

		The ornament indicating high birth , she is placed by her preserver as an attendant upon the Queen
Vasavadatta	PERSON	, who , unknown to either , is her cousin .

		Sagarika falls in love with the
King	PERSON	, like
Louise de la Valliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her affection is betrayed by a pet starling , who repeats to the King a conversation between
Sagarika	ORGANIZATION	and a friend .

		The usual consequences follow .

		In the end ,
Sagarika	ORGANIZATION	's relationship and royal birth are dis - covered , and the Queen accepts her as her husband 's second wife .

		A very startling and effective theatre spectacle occurs in the last act .

		The King and Queen with their attendants are assembled in the garden .

		A conjurer is present , and he makes it appear that the palace , where Sagarika is imprisoned , is in flames .

		The King rushes into the fire to rescue her .

		The conjurer reverses the spell , the palace stands as be - fore , and
Sagarika	LOCATION	and the King descend to meet the others . ''

		Mudra-Rakshasa ; or .

		The Signet of the Minis - ter , '' is a political play without any love interest whatever .

		It relates the plots and counterplots of
Chanakya	LOCATION	, the Minister of
Chandragupta	LOCATION	, and Rak - shasa , the adviser of Malayaketu , -- Chandragupta being the usurper and his rival the representative of the murdered race of
Nanda	ORGANIZATION	, the legitimate King .

		The whole piece has for its purpose the reconcilia - tion of Rakshasa with the reigning monarch ; and this is brought about by the deep devices of Cha - nakya , who outwits his rival at every point , turns all his plots against himself , and gradually dissolves the partnership between
Rakshasa	PERSON	and the prince whose cause he has espoused .

		There is little differ - ence in morality between the two diplomats , though as
Rakshasa	ORGANIZATION	has followed with allegiance a fallen lord he may perhaps be deemed the nobler character .

		But Chanakya is by far the greater man , and there is hardly any figure in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's political plays which makes a greater impression on one of intellectual power and subtlety .

		There is a re - markable scene which out-Machiavels Machiavel , where Chandragupta and his Minister publicly pretend to quarrel , and the latter is apparently disgraced , all in order to lull their enemies into security .

		On the whole , the
Hindoo	PERSON	drama , scanty as it is -LRB- there are about sixty pieces in all -RRB- , is worthy of the profoundest admiration , not only because of its sin - gular prefiguration of the European romantic theatre , but because of its sheer literary power . ''

		The Little Clay Cart '' is Shakespearean throughout in its breadth and lifelikeness .

		Shakuntala may fairly be placed above any work of Shelley , above the '' starry and flowery autos '' of
Calderon	PERSON	.

		And ''
Malati	PERSON	and
Madhava	PERSON	'' touches in certain scenes a height only attained by the greatest dramatists .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The purchase of books by the pound is not a wise way to spend money .

		A twenty-volume `` Library of the World 's Wittiest After-Dinner Speeches '' must be a fearful monster to live with .

		It tips the scales at -LRB- let us say -RRB- half a hundred - weight , and though you may not have actually bar - gained for it by the pound or the cubic foot , you might almost as well have done so , for all the literary worth it possesses .

		A recent Bulletin from the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, containing a classified list of 250 desirable books published in
1907	DATE	, re - prints for the third or fourth time the following piece of wholesome advice , which originally appeared in the '' Journal of New Jersey Libraries '' for
October , 1903	DATE	: '' Finest Orations , Noblest Essays , Royal Flim Flams , Huge Anthologies , and the like , all come to the secondhand man .

		Get them of him , if you must .

		In a small library they are gen - erally almost useless .

		In subscription books , cases like this are not uncommon .

		Maspero wrote several large and learned volumes , in French , on
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Chaldea	LOCATION	.

		They were translated and published in three or four volumes in
England	LOCATION	, costing libraries in this country about
$ 5	MONEY	each .

		An American pub - lisher reprints them in 12 small volumes with a few additional colored cuts , on heavier paper and in larger type , and offers them through agents for
$ 84	MONEY	-- and libraries buy them !

		Do not buy ` sets ' or complete editions of authors .

		Buy the volumes you need and as you need them .

		A complete set always includes several volumes you do not need .

		Specify the edition you wish of standard books when you can , unless you find a bookseller able and will - ing to select them wisely for you . ''

		• • • Commercial methods in library adminis - tration are , naturally enough , extremely repulsive to many an able and enthusiastic librarian .

		Any - thing like business ' * hustle '' or loud-voiced self - advertising might well make an
Edwards	PERSON	or a
Panizzi	PERSON	or a
Spofford	ORGANIZATION	turn in his grave .

		Yet for certain purposes -- as for making mechanics and artisans aware of the benefit they , in their calling , can derive from the public library -- some sort of advertising seems advisable .

		A librarian may well shrink from crying the virtues of his wares in poetry or philosophy or religion , but even a large-type public notice that the four volumes of
Richardson	PERSON	on '' Practical Blacksmithing '' have been added to the library ought not to shock the sensitive .

		Once upon a time a certain painter -LRB- not a latter-day
Raphael	PERSON	or Rembrandt , but just a humble artist in clapboard and wainscot decoration -RRB- entered a public library not a thousand miles from
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, and , being '' out of a job , '' spent some time browsing among the books .

		To his joy and surprise , he dis - covered works bearing on his trade .

		Although he had been a card-holder for years , he had never before had a suspicion that such books were there on the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 shelves , waiting to be drawn .

		The painter 's glad astonishment gave a hint to the librarian : mimeo - graphed lists of available works on different trades and industries were circulated , the local newspapers were prevailed upon to give publicity to these and other resources of the library , and as a result the circulation of that library increased twenty-five per cent in one year .

		All of which goeth to show that a library that is set on a hill may , unfortunately , be hid -- until it condescends to reveal itself .

		• • • Attainment of the quiet mind , the philosophic calm , the placid content , that makes beautiful , even in the eyes of restless youth , some hoary-headed grandparent , some scarred veteran of many wars , or some weather-beaten sea-captain , retired after count - less voyages , is a thing as difficult as it is desirable .

		The ocean life as a sedative received not long ago a few words of commendation that impress them - selves on the mind .

		In his sermon commemorative of the late Rev.
A. J. Haynes	PERSON	, of
New Haven	LOCATION	,
Professor Emery of Yale	ORGANIZATION	took occasion to say : '' The men of the coast , furthermore , possess that strange serenity of temper which comes from wrestling with the sea .

		They learn early the lesson that impatience and fretf ulness are of no avail ; the sea brings the fog or drives it away regardless of man 's purposes .

		And so they learn to face all the vicissitudes of life with a serene fortitude born of hard experience .

		In youth they have the longing for adventure , not from the fevered fretfulness of the city-bred , but obeying the far ancestral call of the seafaring blood .

		They carry with them the temper which makes them take strange lands calmly as their birthright , but which brings them back like homing birds . ''

		Was
Tennyson	PERSON	quite true to nature in making his aged
Ulysses	PERSON	, homeward come at last from his years of wandering and hardship , so impatient to '' smite the sounding furrows '' once more , and '' to sail beyond the sun - set , and the baths of all the western stars , '' until death should overtake him ?

		A man of his reputed experience and wisdom would rather thank the gods for the rest and peace vouchsafed him at last , and , his mind teeming with varied memories , he would be glad to end his days in undisturbed rumination and in watching the billows beat against the crags of his native
Ithaca	LOCATION	.

		• • • The sevenpenny reprint , which is a respect - able and self-respecting cloth-bound book , and is not to be confused with the sixpenny paper-covered novel or magazine , has apparently proved a com - mercial and a literary success in
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		In an interview -LRB- published in '' The Book Monthly '' -RRB- with Mr.
John Buchan	PERSON	, the
London	LOCATION	member of the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	house of
Thomas Nelson & Son	ORGANIZATION	, he is reported as saying : '' We are still asked , as often as ever , how it is done .

		We owe large thanks to the booksellers , some of whom , there can be no harm in saying , were a little opposed to the ' sevenpenny ' at the start ... Our returns for the first year showed ■ ales of two million copies , and it is worth pointing out that the gross profit earned by the book trade on this return would be about
# 20,000	MONEY	.

		To earn as much on six-shilling novels , some three hundred thousand of these would have to be sold , and they do n't sell like that ... Moreover , the ' seven - penny ' is stock which moves quickly : it is bought by customers who otherwise might leave a shop without buying at all , and it attracts new customers . ''

		Living authors whose books are , by permission , included in the sevenpenny reprints , are said to like the plan because it insures a large circulation , and that , too , among a class of purchasers not otherwise reached .

		If credit is due the man who makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before , commendation should not be withheld from a fair and honorable scheme that causes six copies of a good book to be bought where only one found a purchaser before .

		, , , Our greatest public library 's rapid expan - sion is impressively brought to notice in the pages of the '' Fifty-Sixth Annual Report of the Trustees of the
Public Library of the City of Boston	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The maintenance of this great metropolitan system now involves the care and management of properties aggregating at least
five million dollars	MONEY	in value .

		Besides the splendid
Central Library	ORGANIZATION	in
Copley Square	LOCATION	, there are twenty-eight branches and reading - rooms , while books are also delivered regularly at forty-six engine houses , thirty-one '' institutions '' -LRB- as the librarian conveniently but indefinitely puts it -RRB- , and one hundred and eight public and parochial schools .

		Thus an area exceeding forty-three square miles has local delivery of books and enjoys other library privileges .

		An item of considerable interest relates to the remission of fines incurred by children , after the lapse of six months , which went into effect last year and has set free for use thousands of cards on which fines were due .

		Beneficial results are thought to have followed in diminishing the irregu - lar taking of books from the open shelves .

		In the department of current fiction , this conservative and , as is well known , puritanically particular library has bought , in the twelve months reported on , 1,623 novels -LRB- not counting fiction in foreign languages -RRB- ; and in replacements it has purchased 8,123 volumes of fiction .

		Its total book collection now amounts to 922,348 ... Backwardness in book-learning is not always so disquieting a symptom in school-children as one might be led to infer from recent articles on the subject that have appeared in `` The Psychological Clinic , '' a journal founded and edited by Professor
Lightner Witmer	PERSON	, of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		Certain studies of the extent of retardation in school work in five of our large cities seem to show that in
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	approximately forty per cent of the public-school pupils are less advanced than , for their age , they ought to be ; in
Kansas City	LOCATION	and Camden -LRB- N. J. -RRB- nearly fifty per cent are alleged to be backward .


Boston	LOCATION	proudly shows a delinquent percentage of only 12.5 , and is believed 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, to have a public school system worthy of study by other communities .

		But could one well conceive of any subject less adapted to the methods of exact scientific treatment than this ?

		Indeed , the writers themselves pick flaws in each other 's deductions and computations , and admit that their statistical struc - tures rest on a rather sandy foundation .

		But even if the situation is as bad as it is made out to be , let not the backward boy or girl of
Kansas City	LOCATION	alto - gether lose heart .

		The English inventor ,
Maxim	ORGANIZATION	, has lately told how , in his school days , he was awarded the leather medal for stupidity ; and yet he has pretty clearly demonstrated that he has a braia of his own and knows how to use it .

London	LOCATION	, of all scientific papers published in the nineteenth century .

		Seventeen volumes will be required to contain this immense catalogue , one volume of which , indeed , has already appeared -- that comprising '' Pure Mathematics , '' in nearly 700 large closely printed pages .

		Things of beauty may not , indeed , flower very richly from so sterile a soil as an index of mathematical papers ; but there is more hope in the pages of a forthcoming '' Encyclopaedia of Slavic Philology , '' in the Russian language , edited by Professor
V. Jagic	PERSON	, and issued under the auspices of the
Imperial Academy of Science	ORGANIZATION	, in
St. Peters	LOCATION	- burg .

		Five or six large volumes are expected to contain the various contributions of Slavic philolo - gists ; and one of these volumes , or a part of one , is already completed , giving a sketch of Russian literature from the
seventeenth century	DATE	to the nine - teenth , by Professor
E. Budde	PERSON	, and designated as Part XII .

		of the entire work .

		The faith and zeal of those publishers and learned societies that dare to undertake such ponderous works are surely to be admired .

		... The loss of an English scholar of rare crit - ical ability , an educator of varied and honorable achievement , a lecturer of power and of charm , as we have had opportunity to learn in this country , and a promoter in general of what is sound and wholesome in the world of letters , is that of Professor
J. Churton Collins	PERSON	, who was found dead in the fens of
East Anglia	LOCATION	.

		`` Well read and of pronounced opinions in his chosen department of English liter - ature , he did not confine his activities within its bounds .

		Among his later activities may be noted his establishment of a school of journalism for graduates in arts and science .

		So diligent was he in every work to which he put his hand that it is thought he undermined his health by excessive in - dustry .

		Rarely did he take more than six hours of sleep out of the twenty-four , and often less .

		Person - ally he was of gi * eat courtesy in his bearing , and he can not fail to have left many friends to mourn his loss .

		A BRISK CIRCULATION OF PUBLIC-LIBRARY BOOKS is as desirable as a brisk circulation of blood in the body .

		The one no less than the other begets buoy - ancy and cheerfulness , and a certain sanguine con - viction that the lark and the snail are about their usual business and the world is all right , as
Pippa	LOCATION	parenthetically observes .

		The Public Library of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, tried by fire and shaken upsidedown by earthquake , is -LRB- to use a commercial phrase -RRB- doing a larger business on a smaller capital than any library we at present know of .

		Since last year its circulation has increased one-third .

		The librarian reports : '' A circulation of 465,437 from a total -LRB- on
June 30 , 1908	DATE	-RRB- of 54,317 volumes is the equivalent of loaning each book in the Library an average of over eight and a half times during the year ; but it should be borne in mind that a large number of the 54,317 volumes are reference works and do not circulate , so that the average is in reality much higher . ''

		He predicts still more creditable results as soon as the smitten library shall have more perfectly recovered from its recent disaster .

		... The '' REAL ACTIVITIES '' OF AN INSTITUTION OF LEARNING are not , as the unreflecting might hastily infer , intellectual : they are muscular .

		The occur - rence of an intercollegiate football game in the Stadium at
Harvard	LOCATION	, on the
afternoon	TIME	preceding the opening of the academic year , was an event of a nature that might have excited comment in an earlier age ; but now the cutting short of one 's vaca - tion in order to return to college and undergo a week or ten days of preliminary training for a game that itself takes place before the term opens , is taken as a matter of course .

		In fact , one of the leading
Boston	LOCATION	newspapers , in its editorial mention of this first football game of the year at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, speaks of it as inaugurating `` the season 's real activities at the university . ''

		These physical activities , then -- chiefly brachial and crural on the part of the eleven elect , pulmonary and bronchial on the part of their less `` beefy '' mates and admirers -- are henceforth to be regarded as the '' real activities '' of a univer - sity .

		What is more , the paper has already responded to the new editor 's touch , and has doubled its size and trebled its advertising .

		Mr.

		National anthems , too , are something like poets , in not being made by taking thought .

		Mrs.

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		A TIMELY EUPHEMISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		It will , perhaps , not be thought strange if some of the readers of your characteristically sane and cautious journal experience an amused surprise at finding the reviewer of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's novel '' Together '' saying that the work '' lacks the virtue of reticence . ''

		Although I should hardly plead guilty to belonging to '' the out - raged hosts of hypocrisy '' to whom the reviewer refers , I will confess to finding '' Together '' dull , and devoid of the plot construction that I want in a novel , quite irrespective of its '' strength '' -- an artistic quality that Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	evidenced full possession of in '' The Common Lot . ''

		But these are matters of taste and opinion ; and so , I suppose , is the exercise of '' the virtue of reticence '' in a novel dealing with problems of sex relationship .

		But I wonder how many of your readers will like to join me in my congratulations upon the addition of a new euphemism to the critic 's vocabulary , -- and one likely to prove very useful , with the present trend of current fiction .

		A QUESTION OF FIRST TRANSLATIONS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I enclose a clippmg from the advertising pages of the current Dial -LRB- I always read the advertisements ! -RRB-

		and take the liberty of calling attention to what seems to me an error in the advertisement of
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who announce an edition of `` The Tumbler of Our Lady , and Other Miracles '' as '' now first translated from the Middle French
MSS	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		I had a copy of this work in
November , 1899	DATE	, published in the Bibelot series by Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	, who says of it : `` It was first done into English in
1894	DATE	, by the Rev.

		Moreover , the story has been told by a modern French writer in his own fashion -- giving no credit to the anonymous twelfth century writer .

		I think this was
Anatole France	LOCATION	, but at this moment can not verify the impression .

		It is easy to believe that the publishers , as well aa the new translator , may not have known of the earlier translation .

		But it seems desirable that the work should not continue to be announced as the first English version .

		TWO CASUAL QUERIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I like your '' Casual Comments . ''

		They have the charm that belongs to casual things , and part of that charm is to be suggestive -- at times even tantalizing .

		Therefore , would you miud divulging which two lines of '' The Rainy Day '' could reasonably be printed with seven words wrong out of fifteen ?

		Upon investigation I find that there are three sets of lines that contain the requisite number of words ; so there is no way of being certain which of them the correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation '' garbled so amazingly .

		In his article on
Richard Wilson	PERSON	, Mr.
Edward E. Hale	PERSON	, Jr. , employs an expression about whose origin I have often wondered .

		I mean '' petering-out . ''

		So I seize the opportunity to inquire about it , of you or any of your etymologically inclined readers .


Margaret Vance	PERSON	.

		Oak Park , III ,
October 4 , 1908	DATE	.

		-LSB- The first stanza of `` The Rainy Day '' is as follows : '' The day is cold , and dark , and dreary ; It rains , and the wind is never weary ; The vine still clings to the mouldering wall , But at every gust the dead leaves fall , And the day is dark and dreary . ''

		As printed in the
London	LOCATION	journal , the dead leaves fall from moss instead of vine , in the third line ; and the fourth and fifth lines are transformed thus : '' And with every gust some dead leaves fall : Some days must be dark and dreary . ''

		A comparison will show that seven out of these fifteen words do not correspond with the original .

		We find '' petering-out '' -LCB- to peter out -- to exhaust , to run out -RRB- in many of the dictionaries , but with very little light upon its origin .

		It is generally stated to be '' a mining colloquialism . ''

		Curiously enough , the earliest use of it we have found cited is by
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, who said of the store in which he was a partner , in
New Salem	LOCATION	, 111. , in
1832	DATE	, that it was '' petering out . ''

		In

		Memories of the
American Stage	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Whatever pronouncement Mr.
William Win	PERSON	- ter , dean of American dramatic critics , may make concerning the stage will be sure to com - mand the attention of all who are devoted to the theatre , and especially of those who have its highest interests at heart .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	speaks with the authority of an expert , with the judg - ment acquired by long experience , with the knowledge and sympathy which
spring	DATE	from personal acquaintance and association , and with the critical acumen and graceful style of the scholar . ''

		Other Days , being Chronicles and Memories of the Stage '' is Mr.
Winters	PERSON	latest contribution to the history of the drama , which his publishers have issued in a handsome and finely illustrated volume of nearly four hundred pages .

		Its contents include , first , '' a royal line '' ; and the royal line includes outline sketches of
John Hodgkinson	PERSON	,
James Fennell	PERSON	,
Thomas Cooper	PERSON	,
Edwin Forrest	PERSON	,
Junius Brutus Booth	PERSON	,
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	,
Edwin Booth	PERSON	, and
Henry Irving	ORGANIZATION	.

		The careers of these eight actors , sketched currente calamo , form the background against which he has most charmingly delineated in de - tail the dramatic portraits of
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	,
John Brougham	PERSON	,
Dion Boucicault	PERSON	,
Charlotte Cushman	LOCATION	,
Edward A. Sothern	PERSON	,
John McCul	PERSON	- lough ,
Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	,
Mary Anderson	PERSON	, and
Adelaide Neilson	LOCATION	-- the nine artists who , we may infer , stand highest in his estimation .


Richard Mansfield	PERSON	is not included in the list , but Mr.
Winter	PERSON	explains the omission by the fact that he has been engaged for several years , with that artist 's sanction , upon a work entitled '' Life and Art of
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	, '' to be published pres - ently .

		Several pages of interesting notes and an elaborate and accurate index close the volume .

		It is clear that Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, while recognizing Forrest 's talent , is not an ardent admirer of his style , though he admits , in one connection : '' There are times when it is a comfort to see somebody who can let himself out .

		Forrest could . ''

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	further says of him : '' Forrest was an uncommonly massive and puissant animal , and all his impersonations were more physical than intellectual , while no one of them possessed any spiritual element whatever .

		... In threatening situa - tions of peril , suspense , or conflict , requiring the oppo - sition of granite solidity , physical power , vehement • Othee Days : Being Chronicles and Memories of the Stage .

		tumult , and overwhelming vociferation , he was tre ' mendously effective , ... From the first , and until the last , his acting was saturated with < realism , ' and that was one reason of his extensive popularity .

		He could at all times be seen , heard , and understood .

		He struck with a sledge-hammer .

		Not even nerves of gutta - percha eonld remain unshaken by his blow .

		In the manifestation of terror he lolled out his tongue , con - torted his visage , made his frame quiver , and used the trick-sword with the rattling hilt .

		In scenes of fury he panted , snorted , and snarled , like a wild beast .

		In death scenes his gasps and gurgles were protracted and painfully literal . ''

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	remarks that Forrest was '' a good hater . '' ''

		He publicly whipped the poet ,
N. P. Willis	PERSON	; he would not allow
John Gilbert	PERSON	, that noble and excellent man , to play in any company with which he was acting ; he disliked
Edwin Booth	PERSON	; he detested
Charlotte	LOCATION	Cushman . ''

		In this connection , I may be pardoned for citing a case in point from my own experience .

		I had criticised Forrest in his palmy days , much to his satisfaction .

		But during his last season at
McVicker	PERSON	's Theatre , in
Chicago	LOCATION	, he had lost much of his power , his resonant voice had weak - ened , and he was afflicted with gout .

		In a review of his acting I incautiously intimated that the '' veteran lagged superfluous . ''

		Forrest , boiling over with rage , asked Mr.
McVicker	PERSON	who wrote '' that criticism '' of him .

		Upon being informed as to the authorship ,
Forrest	ORGANIZATION	said : '' You go and tell that critic that
Edwin Forrest	PERSON	will live to eat the goose that eats the grass that grows on his grave .

		If it were not for my gout I would go and tell him myself . ''

		Alas !

		poor Forrest has been in his grave these many years , and the goose that was to graze on his critic 's grave is still immune .

		Of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	's personation of Richelieu , Mr.
Winter	PERSON	says : '' No impersonation has been seen , with more in it of heart , and exquisite finish .

		The art of it was like an embroidered cloth of gold .

		Every detail of that mem - orable embodiment , nevertheless , had been planned with scrupulous care and executed with formal fidelity to a settled design . '

		I am conscious , ' Booth once said to me , ` of an interior personality standing back of my own , watching and guiding me . '

		It was his clear intellect .

		In every important part that he played he revealed a great nature ; and the memory of his genius , his beautiful character , and his beneficent life can never pass away . ''

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	dwells long and lovingly upon
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	and his exquisite art . ''

		The magical charm of his acting was the deep human sympathy and the loveliness of individuality by which it was irradiated , -- an exquisite blending of humor , pathos , grace , and beauty , that made it an intimate and confidential impartment to each and every mind and heart in all the vast auditory that he addressed .

		He often made me think of
Emerson	LOCATION	's expressive line : ' Surely he carries a talisman under his tongue . '

		**
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 The analysis of
Jefferson	PERSON	the man is a remark - able one .

		`` He was more a man of imagination and feeling than of cold intellect and exact thought .

		He was full of caprices ; mercurial and fanciful ; a creature of moods ; exceedingly , almost morbidly , sensitive ; eagerly desirous to please , because he loved to see people happy ; willing , if necessary , to displease everybody rather than win favor by unworthy means or by the violation of a principle of art ; quick to fancy that he had been misimderstood ; very affectionate ; keenly sensible of the misfortunes and sufferings of the lame , the blind , the deaf and the wretched ; inordinately fond of approbation , and , at the same time , aware of the shallow mentality and hypo - critical insincerity of many of the persons who make up the social world ; appreciative of the beauties of physical Nature , passionately fond of them , and skilful in paint - ing them ; as much a lover of sports as though he were a boy ; worldly-wise , and yet absolutely simple ; sagacious in practical affairs , but credulous about everything preternatural or improbable ; an instinctively correct and -LRB- when left to himself -RRB- an unerring judge of char - acter , but apt to be influenced by the nearest person who chanced to have possession of his confidence ; innately modest and humble , but aware of the excep - tional merit of his artistic faculties and of their value ; serious , almost solemn at heart , but , superficially , vola - tile , mirthful , and good-naturedly satirical ; tender in feeling , but quick to see the comic side of everything , -- even of things the most serious . ''

		Of
John Brougham	PERSON	's personation of Captain
Maguire	PERSON	, in the '' Serious Family , '' Mr.
Winter	PERSON	says : '' It was not only his fervent , sparkling , natural per - formance that attracted me , it was the personality of the actor , -- that subtle quality , potential either to charm or to repel , which , in a long experience of the stage , I have found to be of vital and decisive import - ance .

		He had dash , buoyancy , joyous freedom , a combination of graces and allurements making the gallant manliness that always wins the heart of youth .

		That charm he never lost .

		Time made him , personally , sedate , but his acting never ceased to be blithe and happy .

		Mirth was as natural to him as music to the rippling brook or color to the rose . ''

		In connection with the account of
Brougham	PERSON	's funeral , Mr.
Winter	PERSON	recalls the following serio - comic incident : ``
Edwin Booth	PERSON	and I assisted to bear his pall .

		I remember that the two grave diggers , after they had lowered his coffin a little way into the grave , were con - strained , with many muttered exclamations of ' Aise her ! '

		and ' Raise her ! '

		to lift it up again , in order to enlarge the cavity .

		Booth and I , like Hamlet and
Horatio	PERSON	, were standing under a neighboring tree , ob - serving those proceedings , and nothing was ever more wofuUy comic or more humorously rueful than Hamlet '' s smile , as he looked at me , with those deep , melancholy eyes , and with that little , furtive grimace , murmuring , as he did so , ' It is the last recall . ' ''

		In his sketch of Boucicault , Mr.
Winter	PERSON	dwells more upon his ability as a playwriter than upon his performance as an actor .

		He closes the sketch with a serious comment .

		`` His youth was precocious , adventurous , luxurious ; his manhood was fortunate , self-indulgent , arrogant ; his age was lonely and miserable ; and , as a whole , his life , -- notwithstanding its flurries of wealth and popu - larity , -- was unhappy .

		The retrospection of it affords a melancholy spectacle : for , what does it signify that a man has written a clever book , or made a brilliant speech , or pleased an audience with a fine dramatic performance , if , when the sod has closed over his ashes , nobody thinks of him with a sigh or cares to place a flower on his grave ! ''

		It is easy to see that
Charlotte Cushman	PERSON	was Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's ideal of artistic superiority .

		He closes his sketch of her with this fine tribute : '' Within the last thirty years several female actors have been distinguished in tragedy on the American stage , many beautiful women have appeared , and dis - plays have been made of genius and ability in various lines of dramatic art ; but of opulent power in acting , such as was manifested , at certain supreme moments , in the Othello of
Forrest	LOCATION	, the
Lear of Booth	ORGANIZATION	, the Virginius of
McCullough	PERSON	, the
Cassius of Barrett	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Lady Macbeth of Charlotte Cushman	ORGANIZATION	, the audience of the present day has seldom seen a suggestive example .

		The contemporary American stage is fortunate , as to actresses , in the romantic loveliness of Miss
Julia Mar	PERSON	- lowe , the intellectual force and striking originality of Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	, the gentle beauty and profound devotion of Miss
Viola Allen	PERSON	, the abundant passion and exquisite vo - calism of Mrs.
Carter	PERSON	, and the wild , dashing , picturesque abandonment of Miss
Blanche Bates	PERSON	; but no woman in the theatre of this period shows the inspirational fire , the opulent intellect , the dominant character and the abounding genius , -- rising to great heights and satisfy - ing the utmost demand of great occasions , -- that were victorious and imperial in
Charlotte	LOCATION	Cushman . ''

		Sothern 's Lord Dundreary , says Mr.
Winter	PERSON	, '' as a work of dramatic art , viewed with refer - ence to its elaborate complex mosaic of detail , ranks with the most felicitous and memorable of recorded specialties . ''

		A pitiful picture is drawn of
McCullough	PERSON	's last days ; and of his failings he speaks with gentle charity , while com - mending his fine talent .

		That he has no sym - pathy with fads is evidenced by the following : '' The fads have their little day ; but , sooner or later , the world comes back to the right standard -- to beauty , purity , simplicity , truth .

		In
McCullough	PERSON	's day there was no thought of devoting the theatre to the exposition of physical disease or to the analysis of morbid emotion and degenerate physical propensities .

		His breezy laugh would have blown the Ibsen bubble from the stage .

		He would have set the heel of amused contempt on all such sickly humbugs as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Sudermann	PERSON	, and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Of
Lawrence Barrett	PERSON	, Mr.
Winter	PERSON	speaks in a serious strain . ''

		He was a vital incarnation of tremendous force , and he was prematurely destroyed by the tempest that surged in his soul . ''

		That Mr.
Winter	PERSON	greatly admired Mary And - erson 's personality is shown by the following : '' Fair ; tall ; of an imperial figure ; her features reg - ular ; her changeful blue eyes , placid as a smnmer 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, lake or blazing with the lire of roused imagination ; her noble head , enwreathed with its copious wealth of golden hair ; her smile , the diamond sparkle of morning light ; her gestures , large , wide , graceful , free ; her movement , at times electrical with action , at times pathetically eloquent of slow , wandering grief or the stupor of des - pair ; her voice , clear , smooth , silvery , ranging through many moods , from the ripple of arch , bewitching mirth to the low moan of anguish , the deep whisper of passion or the clarion note of power -- she filled the scene with her presence , and she filled the hearts of her audience with a refreshing sense of delightful , ennobling conviction of the possible loveliness and majesty of the human soul . ''

		One of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's most cherished mem - ories is of a visit to
Paddington Churchyard	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	with
Mary Anderson	PERSON	, which he thus eloquently describes : '' It was a
Sunday	DATE	, and the neighboring streets were deserted and still .

		The sky , overcast with mist-like clouds , was gray and dim .

		The leaves were falling , the twilight was coming slowly and a faint breeze was idly stirring the thin , withering grass .

		No sound was heard save of rustling foliage and sighing wind .

		I was stand - ing at the grave of
Sarah Siddons	PERSON	, illustrious actress of the Past ; and beside me , pensive and mute , looking down upon the mould , stood
Mary Anderson	PERSON	, auspicious actress of the Present .

		There , on the one side , a few words , cut in marble , to record the end of a glorious life : the garlands dead ; the music hushed ; the pageant vanished .

		Here , on the other side , beauty in its radi - ance ; youth in its triumph ; genius in its power ; fame in its glory .

		The contrast and the monition were too deep for words .

		We laid a few flowers on that grave and turned away in silence . ''

		The last portrait in Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's gallery is that of the beautiful
Adelaide Nielson	PERSON	.

		He recognizes her beauty and personal charm , and likewise her limitations . ''

		She wished to be , and she was determined to be , the leading actress of the English stage in the plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		That purpose she avowed in my presence , and she declared that no consideration should be per - mitted to thwart or impede the accomplishment of that design .

		Observation , in general , considered her char - acter to be weak : at one time she was designated ' a photograph actress . '

		No greater mistake could have been made .

		Her character was , in some respects , exceptionally strong .

		The defect in her organization , and the consequent frailty of her plan , was that she possessed the wild imagination , the ' fine frenzy ' of genius , without , in herself and for herself , its crowning power of perfect intellectual control . ''

		In the closing pages of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's book he contrasts stage conditions of the present with those of the past , and finds them '' unsatisfactory to persons who possess judgment , knowledge , and taste . ''

		He uses a caustic pen in dealing with the subject , as will be seen by these few extracts : '' The theatrical audience of this period is largely composed of vulgarians who know nothing about art or literature and who care for nothing but the solace of their common tastes and animal appetites . '' ''

		The theatre has fallen into the clutches of sordid , money-grubbing tradesmen , who have degraded it into a bizarre . '' ''

		The theatrical audience is either inconsiderate of the actor or contemptuous of him -- for , as a rule , its sole quest is amusement , and its primary thought is of itself and not of those who ministe : ^ to its mental welfare . '' ''

		In our time the direction of the stage is commonly assumed , not by old , competent , experienced actors , but by some popinjay who calls himself ' a producer , ' and whose whole stock in trade consists of an owlish assump - tion of wisdom , a mischievous celerity in interposing frivolous objections , and an exasperating demeanor of peacock authority . ''

		`` The stage has fallen on evil days ... No indi - cations are now visible that a change for the better is near at hand .

		Every denotement , on the contrary , is indicative of the decline of romance , and the growth of vulgarity and greed . ''

		This constitutes a sharp arraignment of the stage and stage management of to-day .

		There will be some who will condemn Mr.
Winter	PERSON	; many will disagree with him , but others will applaud his courageous defense of the highest mission of the theatre , and will rejoice that now , as always , his pen has been devoted to the fur - therance of that mission .

		They will remember that he has always set a high standard , and has never allowed himself to be diverted from what he believes to be the truth by personal assault of his motives , by ridicule of his high purpose , or by managerial flattery or the sordid influences of commercialism .

		Whether we accept or deny his position there is food for serious thought in his closing chapter , for as Mr.
Winter	PERSON	says : '' The dramatic blessings of the age are not nmnerous , and , with a view to their instruction and the improve - ment of the time in which they live , its worshippers might advantageously inquire whether such conditions as now prevail would have been possible when the theatre , instead of being , as it now is , under the control of a sordid , crafty monopoly , was dominated by such figures as

		While several transitions from one age or period to another are marked by such practices , the init - iatory rites of puberty are particularly common .

		Such puberty ceremonials have been described , especially among Australian , African , and Melanesian populations .

		They are usually obligatory upon all males , and until the youth has undergone them he is not recognized as a man or an active member of his tribe .

		Such rites generally include some test of endurance or bravery , and the fact that they have been per - formed is evidenced by some mutilation or phy - sical mark -- as circumcision , tooth-extraction , or gashing .

		The rite is often symbolical , and involves the apparent death and resurrection of the initiate , the adoption of a new name , the sundering of old ties and relationships and the formation of new ones , and the acquisition and use of a new , or not generally understood , jargon or language .

		During the period of the ceremony the youths live apart and are instructed by older men in the mysteries , the rights , the duties and obligations of tribal membership .

		Thus , '' Australian lads learn the marriage laws , the tribal customs and traditions , the native games , songs , and dances , and the pre - vailing moral code of the community '' at this period of seclusion .

		The ceremonies are an effective system of social control ; they are the means through which the elders rule and gain advantages for themselves .

		They are often marked by deceit and trickery , and magic and mystery are employed to enhance their power and effect ; on the whole , however , their result is good . ''

		The initiation ceremonies which have been up to this point the subject of study , present several clearly marked characteristics .

		Above all , they are tribal : every male member of the community must , at some time or other , have passed through them .

		They are secret , and jealously guarded from the eyes of the unin - itiated .

		They are commimal rites , and the occasion of great festive celebrations which call out every member of the tribe and absorb his energies over a protracted period .

		They are organized and conducted by the elders , who are the responsible guardians of the state .

		They have a definite and reasonable purpose : the young men growing into manhood must learn their duties aa members of the community ; they must be schooled in the traditions and moral regulations developed through long periods of tribal experience .

		On the transmission and perpetuation of this experience , the life of the com - munity depends .

		In a state of society destitute of centralized political control , such puberty rites constitute the most effective means of providing that subordination of the interests of the individual to the welfare of the whole , without which social progress can not be long maintained .

		The initiatory institutions found among the most primitive peoples in every quarter of the globe answer to the most definite and imperative of social requirements . ''

		With development in the form of social organization , the need of these initiation cere - monies becomes less .

		As the chieftainship becomes more sharply defined , there grows up what Dr.
Webster	PERSON	calls the tribal secret society .

		These are aristocratic fraternities of limited and selected membership , the function of which is the performance of religious and magical rites for the benefit of the tribe .

		Such secret societies are not an invariable development , but where they occur they grow out of the old initiation ceremonies , and are marked by many of their practices .

		They too serve as a mode of control , the political , judicial , and economic value of which is great .

		Such societies are common and are remarkably developed among American Indian tribes and many African peoples .

		They are usually characterized by limited membership , '' degrees , '' '' lodges , '' and '' elaborate parapher - nalia of mystery . ''

		The old effort of the elder men to hold the power in their own hands is here maintained , as only the older members can reach the higher degrees .

		While the value and function of such tribal secret societies has already been somewhat suggested , their operations are varied and deserve specific statement .

		They pro- vide an inter-tribal bond ; they act to strengthen or reinforce the rising power of the chief , -- it is the man who is mounting to political power who succeeds in gaining the higher degrees , and behind him as a reliable supporting force are those who participate with him in the secret rites of his lodge ; they confer upon their member - ship privileges which place them above and out - side of many of the tabus and prohibitions holding upon the uninitiated .

		The tribal secret societies thus become definite and powerful sys - tems of control .

		This is clearly shown in such organizations as the duk-duk of Melanesia and the purr ah of
Sierra Leone	ORGANIZATION	.

		One function , so marked and definite that some writers have con - 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, sidered it the sole purpose of these organizations , is the keeping of women in subjection .

		Notwithstanding its value and power , the tribal secret society tends to disappear with advancing social progress .

		As communities increase in importance , and social intercourse grows , the mystery upon which the society depends disappears .

		One symptom of this de - cline is the admission of women to membership .

		Contact with new and notably different social conditions works toward their disintegration and destruction ; the trader and the missionary alike aid in their downfall .

		We often find the weakened tribal secret society the stronghold of conservatism and of opposition to foreign influ - ence .

		It usually disappears in one of two suc - cessors -- the social club or the magical fraternity .

		To the latter , which is far the more important , are related totemic clan ideas .


Webster	PERSON	's con - cluding argument is devoted to a consideration of the development of the magical fraternity of priests and shamans charged with the perfor - mance of magical and dramatic rites , and its relation to the primitive totemic groups .

		This summary of Dr.
Webster	PERSON	's discussion is condensed from his own outline , and adequately conveys an idea of his treatment of this import - ant and interesting subject .

		The value of his work is apparent , and his book is the most satis - factory presentation of its subject so far made in English .

		It is the most important American contribution to anthropological theory that has appeared for a long time .

		Not that we agree with each and every claim , but the argument is well presented and the treatment will serve as the basis for any further consideration .

		Two minor points of taste and usage may be raised .

		Why does Dr.
Webster	PERSON	use the form Basutos ?

		He does so more than once -- as '' Basutos boys . ''

		Basuto is a noun and an adjective .

		There is a tendency to use many tribal names as invariable , in respect of num - ber , -- as
Eskimo	LOCATION	,
Botocudo	LOCATION	,
Ainu	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		In some cases this usage is perhaps based upon the fact that the original name -LRB- as used by the tribe itself or its neighbors -RRB- is invariable .

		Whether this be the fact or not , in any given case , the tendency exists among anthropological writers , and seems good .

		So far as the word
Basuto	PERSON	is concerned , it is already plural -- meaning the Suto tribe or people .

		As a noun , then , Basutos is bad .

		Our author 's use of it is adjectival ; and it is rather late in English to make an adjective agree in form with a plural novm .

		Had this use of the word Basutos occurred but once in Professor
Webster	PERSON	's book we should not mention it .

		It occurs more than once , and hence seems to represent some rule of procedure .

		Again , Dr.
Webster	PERSON	pursues what we con - sider a deplorable practice in the matter of quotation .

		So far as concerns writers in English , he generally does not make exact quotation , preferring to re-state , in his own words , their facts or conclusions .

		We hail his method and commend his practice .

		We are only too glad to break away from the style of most of our gov - ernmental reports , where pages upon pages present to us , not the author 's own thought , observation , digest , or argument , but a series of long quotations , frequently of no value , which merely show the compiler 's lack of original thought and labor and his desire to produce a bulky volume by padding .

		Professor
Webster	PERSON	, we have said , avoids this ; and we thank him for it .

		But he does quote passages from foreign writers , and these are in the original languages .

		Thus , we have quotations in
Haddon	LOCATION	's English as she is pigeoned in
Melanesia	LOCATION	-- which ought never to have been printed thus by
Haddon	LOCATION	him - self -- in French , in German , and in Italian .

		These quotations mar Dr.
Webster	PERSON	's work .

		We hardly believe that he could not translate and re-state these as exactly as he re-states his English references .

		It may be that all who will read the book can translate these passages for themselves ; but we hope not .

		The book is too good a book to be read by so small a group of readers .

		It is published by a regular publish - ing house that seeks trade , at a price warranting a good sale to libraries and individuals .

		In such a book , these quotations smack of pedantry .

Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	should find his biog - rapher in an almost equally painstaking and finished artist in letters , Mr.

		The '' Life , '' awaited with something of eager - ness and impatience , fulfils expectation : it fit - tingly and delicately portrays the man and author who was taken from us a year and a half ago , one of the last survivors of
New England	LOCATION	's Augustan age .

		Its excellence is one of exclu - sion no less than of inclusion : in the compass of three hundred uncrowded pages the story is told -- or largely made to tell itself from letters -- with a minimum of comment and criticism .

Life of Thomas Bailey Aldrich	ORGANIZATION	.

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 No selection from the correspondence could have been more discreet : personal names are fre - quently supplied by dashes , and nothing that could have vexed the soul of the writer has been given to the public .

		As
Aldrich	PERSON	himself once said , after reading the
Browning	PERSON	letters , `` a man -- even the greatest -- can not stand being photographed in his pajahmas '' ; and he thanks heaven that we are spared
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's letters to
Anne Hathaway	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	takes early occasion to explain that the theme of his book '' is not the develop - ment of a literary faculty ; it is the story of a man 's life . ''

		A closing chapter of twenty pages is given to ''
Aldrich	PERSON	's Poetry '' ; the rest of the book is briskly and entertainingly narrative , with that literary allusiveness , that concernment with the things of the poet 's and novelist 's and editor 's world , that one looks for first of all in such a biography .

		The early training of the curly-haired , bright-faced youth who was born in
Portsmouth	LOCATION	almost seventy-two years ago was not what one might have prescribed for a future poet .

		Disappointed in his hope of a college education , his father having died suddenly when the son was but thirteen years old , that son -- the only child , as it chanced , of his widowed mother -- entered at sixteen the counting-room of his uncle 's commission-house in
Pearl Street	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		But , as the author says , -- '' The years from
1852	DATE	to
1855	DATE	, that
Aldrich	PERSON	spent as a clerk ... seem to have left very little impress on his mind .

		Possibly some of his careful habits may have been formed there , and something of his shrewdness and capacity in business matters , a capacity not very prevalent among poets , may have sprung from this early training ; but from the first he occupied himself more with lyrics than with ledgers .

		And his uncle used humor - ously to complain that he would always be found study - ing Spanish or doing something else equally remote from the commission business .

		His real life was lived in the little back-hall bedroom on the third floor of the house in
Clinton Place	LOCATION	, where amid his books , his pipes , his Japanese fans , of which he was an early collector , he saw '' ' Such sights as youthfnl poets dream On
summer	DATE	eves by haunted stream ' ; and wrote , as he recalled late in his life , `` a lyric or two every day before going downtown . ' ''

		It was this same uncle , of the Pearl Street counting-house , who said to his nephew , when the young man had announced that the editor of ''
Harper	PERSON	's '' had accepted a poem of his and paid him fifteen dollars for it , -- '' Why do n't you send the d d fool one every day ? ''

		It is in the generous selections from
Aldrich	PERSON	's correspondence that the chief interest of the book lies -- by the wise intention of the self - suppressing biographer .

		And how good the correspondence is !

		One does not have to add the contradictory adjective used by
Aldrich	PERSON	him - self in writing of
Lowell	LOCATION	's letters . ''

		How good and how poor they are ! ''

		he exclaims . ''

		Nearly all of them are too self-conscious .

		Emerson and
Whittier	LOCATION	are about the only men in that famous group who were not thinking about themselves the whole while .

		They were too simple to pose or to be intentionally brilliant . ''

		Very little of premeditation is there in the brilliancy of the letters sent forth from Mt.
Vernon Street	PERSON	, from
Ponkapog	LOCATION	, or from the other places of residence or sojourn in the writer 's somewhat widely - roaming life .

		His flashes seem as unexpected to himself as to his readers .

		Writing to Mr.
Ho	PERSON	wells in
1876	DATE	, he speaks of '' The Queen of Sheba , '' then just begun , and closes with a whimsical reference to birthdays . ''

		Here is a grand chance for something at once humor - ous and tragic .

		I feel at my poor best in the story , and in respect to style and characterization , I intend to leave my other prose tales behind -- in their proper places ! ''

		I have n't the heart to congratulate you on your birthday .

		I used to Qoddle mine , playing with it , as an infant plays with a powder-horn .

		A birthday is likely to go off any time , and leave a fellow dead , or at least mutilated for life . ''

		Opinions of contemporary authors , expressed in no uncertain terms , are scattered through the letters .

		For example ,
Aldrich	PERSON	says of one of these coevals : '' Henry
James	PERSON	has a plump and rosy prose style , and lots of observation .

		I envy him the easy grace with which he slips his pen through forty or fifty miles of aristocratic land - scape . ''

		And further , in regard to the same writer : '' I think that characters in a novel should develop themselves by what they say and what they do -- as in the drama .

		It appears to me a mistake to devote one or two hundred pages to the analysis of characters which accomplishes nothing .

		The persons in
James	LOCATION	's book affect me like a lot of admirably ' made up ' actors in the green-room waiting for their cue .

		Au reste , I greatly admire
Henry James	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is an essayist of the very finest type ; but he is not a natural story-teller . ''

		Walt Whitman he rated not high among poets . ''

		The greater bulk of his writing , '' he declares , '' is neither prose nor verse , and cer - tainly it is not an improvement on either .

		A glorious line now and then , and a striking bit of color here and there , do not constitute a poet -- especially a poet for the Peopled It would have been strange indeed if these two had admired each other !


Browning	PERSON	, whom he else - where links with
Tennyson	PERSON	in a chance bit of passing commendation , he describes personally in a few graphic phrases . ''

		I met
Browning	PERSON	on three occasions .

		He was very cordial to me in a man-of-the-world fashion .

		I did not care greatly for him personally .

		Good head , long body .

		252 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, short legs .

		Seated , he looked like a giant ; standing , he just missed being a dwarf .

		He talked well , but not so well as
Lowell	LOCATION	. ''

		Of self-criticism and other illuminating com - ments that indicate and exemplify
Aldrich	PERSON	's own literary methods and ideals , there is an abundance in these selected letters .

		To
Miss Woodman	PERSON	, who soon afterward became Mrs.
Aldrich	PERSON	, we find him writing , in reference to a poem he had sent her in manuscript : '' See if there are not any passages where the idea is not worked out sharply .

		Obscurity , I think , is a kind of stupidity , and I seek to avoid it always . ''

		In another letter he says : '' There is only one critic I stand greatly in dread of ; he becomes keener and more exacting every month ; he is getting to be a dreadful fellow for me , and his name is
T. B. Aldrich	PERSON	.

		There is no let up to him . ''

		And still again : '' I have a way of looking at my own verse as if it were written by some man I did n't like very well , and thus I am enabled to look at it rather impersonally , and to discover when I liave fallen into mere * fine writing , ' a fault I am inclined to , while .

		I detest it .

		I think '
Wyndham Towers	ORGANIZATION	' my best long poem , and * Friar
Jerome	PERSON	' the next best . ''

		The final chapter , as already stated , treats of Aldrich as a poet , its predecessors having dealt more particularly with his prose .

		After some comment on the exquisite piece of verse entitled '' Memory '' the biographer says : '' The lasting significance of
Aldrich	PERSON	's poetry lies in such pieces as this .

		Psychology , metaphysics , were unknown lands to him .

		Yet with his fine sensitiveness , his clear and candid mind , he was no stranger to some of the subtlest thoughts , the most wayward and wistful moods of his moody age .

		This alone would not give him his peculiar distinction .

		Other men have been more sensitive to the age-spirit , more ' representative . '

		But when
Aldrich	PERSON	went to embody the eerie impulse in verse the miracle happened .

		He immortalized the moment 's exquisite pang of memory or joy or forebod - ing , not in shadowy , but in crystalline verse .

		Impulses the most romantic in the world he guided by an instinct that was purely classic in its inspired poise .

		His most characteristic work is that in which the terse polish of an epigram but makes more memorable the frisson , the haunting , heart-searching thrill of the sudden thought . ''

		In a complex and quizzical age , an age when ' The Muse in alien ways remote Goes wandering , '
Aldrich	PERSON	, by the miracle of genius , and by his mastery of his art , sang of beautiful and pleasant and sad things as simply as an Elizabethan or a Greek singer of the Anthology .

		For those who love poetry as a fine art , who read it for pure delight , his place in our literature is unique and secure . ''

		If the book presents an Aldrich who is greater than posterity shall be willing to admit , it is certainly a common and on the whole a good fault in biography -- especially in the biography of one so lately deceased .

		But the eulogy is temperate , and the work is in general most sat - isfying .

		The carefid gathering of material , the consultation with friends of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, the valuable aid of Mrs.
Aldrich	PERSON	, and , not least of all , the author 's own memories of the poet , have combined with his loving study of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's works to produce a biography that will not soon be superseded .

		The customary pictorial em - bellishment is provided ; also a 32-page bibli - ography , giving a chronological list of the orig - inal editions of
Aldrich	PERSON	's writings , and a not over-plethoric index .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The French and Indian War in
America	LOCATION	.

		* In his interesting and valuable work on the History of the
United States	LOCATION	and its People , Mr.
Elroy McKendree Avery	PERSON	has now reached the period of the French and Indian War , the period that was once felt to be peculiarly
Francis Parkman	PERSON	's own .

		Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has not superseded Parkman ; no one could expect him to do that , for the New Englander was both an historical specialist of the highest rank and a literary genius -- two things difficult to find , and rarely found in combination .

		What Mr.
Avery	PERSON	has done , however , is to take
Parkman	PERSON	's material , study it carefully , cidl from it gener - ously , and then add to it the rich findings of investigators subsequent to
Parkman	LOCATION	.

		The result is par excellence .

		The opening chapter of this , Mr.
Avery	PERSON	's fourth volume , covers the events of the years immediately following
King George	ORGANIZATION	's War ; and in characteristic fashion it describes the evidences of social , economic , and educational progress , closing with a very careful account of
George Washington	LOCATION	's expedition northward in the inter - ests of the
Ohio Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second chap - ter deals with the colonial preparation for the last great conflict with
France	LOCATION	; the third , the fourth , and the fifth , with the quadrilateral cam - paign of
1756	DATE	.

		Of this campaign , the best - known incidents are the
Braddock	PERSON	disaster and the removal of the Acadians , to both of which
Avery	PERSON	has done justice , except that in the case of the first he might have sought to correct the erroneous but widely-diffused idea that
Braddock	PERSON	was ambuscaded .

		In the words of Professor
Bourne	PERSON	of

		THE DIAL 263 scouts and had taken every precaution against surprise , but the trail was narrow , and , as the French could fight in front and on both sides , his vanguard was thrown into hopeless confu - sion . ''

		Concerning
Avery	PERSON	's treatment of the Acadian affair , perhaps more might be said than simply that he has done the subject justice ; for he has evidently a thorough grasp of the material in hand , and has shown the Aeadians to be what they really were , a litigious , priest-ridden , and far from innocent people .

		That so much false sentiment has been expended upon their fate is much to be deplored ; for even as exiles they do not stand alone , their story has more than one parallel in history , and the idealization of them , which began with
Abbe Raynal	PERSON	, was continued by
George Bancroft	PERSON	, and found its culmination in
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' Evangeline , '' had no basis in fact .

		They were disloyal and treacherous to the core .

		That Great
Britain	LOCATION	might have exacted hostages of them as an alternative to removal , is sometimes suggested ; but it is doubtful if any - thing coidd have made them keep faith .

		The times were too critical for
Great Britain	LOCATION	to take any chances , and the execution of hostages as a punishment for betrayal would probably have called down upon her in after years an even more severe criticism from credulous and un - thinking people .

		As it was , the Home Govern - ment was not immediately responsible for the removal , the idea of which apparently originated with
Governor Lawrence of Nova Scotia	ORGANIZATION	and was heartily approved of by Governor
Shirley	PERSON	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Both were fully cognizant of the seriousness of the situation .

		The fate of an empire was involved .

		Here and there throughout this interesting volume discussions of military occurrences are interspersed with graphic descriptions of such things as the inefficiency , during the earlier years of the war , of the regular army and its officers ; the motley character of the Colonial contingent ; the failure of local assemblies to respond to the urgent needs of the hour ; the participation of the Indians and their method of warfare ; and , finally , the gross financial corruption of the French administrative system in
Canada	LOCATION	and the rivalry between its civil and military authorities .

		Nowhere can the reader possibly get a better outlook upon the general situation and the com - parative strength of the contestants .

		In his ninth chapter Mr.
Avery	PERSON	outlines the capture of
Louisburg	LOCATION	, once the
Gibraltar of America	ORGANIZATION	, now a ruin .

		That capture was the first great step in the British advance , and the
year 1758	DATE	, in which it occurred , had only one reverse , the loss of
Ticonderoga	LOCATION	-- concerning which a note might be added with reference to the military tactics of the later eighteenth century ; since
Abercromby	PERSON	's defeat , like the subsequent Battle of Bunker Hill , affords a striking illustration of the absurdity of trying to carry a fortification by assault .

		In dealing with the ascent to the
Plains of Abraham	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Avery	PERSON	seems to incline toward those who under - estimate the undertaking ; but he is none the less an admirer of
Wolfe	PERSON	, and classifies the storming and capture of
Quebec	LOCATION	as one of the decisive engagements of the world His chapter on the Peace of
Paris	LOCATION	is not so definite as it might be ; it partakes almost too much of the nature of a digression on court politics .

		The volume closes with two excellent chapters on Indian compli - cations , arising on the one hand from Cherokee resentment of outrages and encroachments , and on the other from the familiar
Pontiac	LOCATION	con - spiracy .

		Before remarking upon a certain historical fact that Mr.
Avery	PERSON	seems to wish to emphasize at this stage of his work , attention should be called to the many valuable maps and other illustrative material that have been added to an already large collection .

		All who realize the close relation existing between geography and history can not fail to appreciate this most re - markable and praiseworthy feature of the book .

		Every movement , no matter how slight , of the contending armies may be traced , and the coor - dination of campaigns thereby understood .

		And now , in returning to the point of emphasis , we can not do better than to quote Mr.
Avery	PERSON	's own words as given in his preface : '' I shall be disap - pointed if the careful reader of these volumes does not understand , even before he takes up the next , that the American Revolution was in the blood , and that the Stamp Act and
George III	PERSON	.

		were simply irritants that hastened what could not be avoided . ''

		It is a book of perennial interest , and stolid is the man who can read its animated and racy pages without a consuming desire to visit the land they portray .

		The manuscript was probably written with a goose-quill , and inevitably some pre-railway information creeps in ; but the discussion is mainly of that which changes little , especially in
Spain	LOCATION	; while the manner is so charmingly discursive and the style so epigrammatic and picturesque that the reader is conscious of holding in his hand one of the most entertaining books of travel in the language .

		Mr.
Richard Ford	PERSON	, an English gentleman of refined and artistic tastes , went to
Spain	LOCATION	in
1830	DATE	for a residence of several years .

		He passed the winters in the south , and during the other seasons rambled about the Peninsula on horseback , carrying note-book and sketching - pad in his saddle-bags .

		A scholar , an art ama - teur , a minute and accurate observer , a collector of curious knowledge , and withal a brilliant writer , he was able to fill his portfolios with the rarest of material .

		Once more at home in
Devonshire	LOCATION	, in a garden-house of Moorish style , shaded by pines , myrtles , and cypresses , brought from the
Alhambra	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ford	PERSON	passed several years working over his notes and writing his en - cyclopaedic '' Handbook for Travellers in
Spain	LOCATION	and Readers at Home . ''

		This remarkable book , really a literary achievement , appeared as one of
John Murray	PERSON	's red-covered guides .

		Published with this unpretending title most unattractively in two formidable volumes of five hundred closely-printed pages each , it yet was received with enthusiasm , and soon became one of the best-known books in
England	LOCATION	.

		Prescott called it '' a perfect treasure , a veritable olla podrida . ''

		Another writer said : '' No work bearing so humble a title ever enjoyed or deserved so imme - diate , so wide , and so enduring a popularity '' ; while
Sonnenschein	PERSON	, who can never be charged with '' mushy appreciations , '' says of it in his great `` Reader 's Guide '' : ''
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's detailed study of the nation is the standard authority , quite classical in value .

		Most modem writers have borrowed from it . ''

		In
1846	DATE	, somewhat over a year after the '' Handbook '' was published , the author selected and improved those portions which had a more general interest , and published them as '' Gather - ings from
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		As the title indicates , this is the pick , the cream of the '' Handbook , '' shorn of its guide-book features .

		It tells the best months to visit different portions of the penin - sula , gives a survey of its geography , geology .

		and botany , describes the roads , discusses the breeds of horses and mules of the various dis - tricts , the harnesses , the manner of driving , and the language used to animals , including instruc - tions on swearing in Spanish .

		Riding and walking tours are planned and outlined with full detail .

		A chapter is devoted to rivers ; two to wines , naming the best varieties and most celebrated vineyards ; one to smoking ; others to eating , costumes , what courtesies to observe , what pleases the Spaniard and what he resents ; in short , all that the intending traveller or the curious reader likes best to know .

		Two excel - lent chapters treat of the bull-fight , descriptively , historically , and philosophically .

		Mr.
Ford	PERSON	is a most admirable adviser of what to observe and what to do .

		Reading his book is like having a long and delightful chat with a comfortable full-blooded sort of fellow , not without his prejudices , but who loves
Spain	LOCATION	and is intimately acquainted with it .

		His epitaph to-day reads : Rerum Hispanim indagator acerrimus .

		THE DIAL 255 ist 's own words ; the age of the Album Amicorum , flowing with watery sentiment -- if halting verse can be said to flow ; and the age in which , as Miss Repplier puts it , the most frivolous occupation of the good boy -LRB- in the story-book -RRB- is searching the Bible , '' with mamma 's permission , '' for texts in which David '' praises God for the weather . ''

		Let us , how - ever , be indulgent , and remember , as we turn in weariness from much of the literature of the '' happy half - century , '' that the paradox of one age is the platitude of the next .

		Probably the happy half - centurians found their books as wise and as witty as we find ours .

		But the wisdom and wit of Miss Repplier 's observations concerning those books and their readers they could not , unfortunately , without committing an unpermissible anachronism , enjoy .

		Essays worth reading .

		American readers of Sir
Spencer Walpole	PERSON	's '' Essays , Political and Biographical '' -LRB- Button -RRB- will no doubt be most generally interested in the author 's estimates of American institutions and men .

		He appreciates the greatness of the
American Republic	ORGANIZATION	, and his sympathies are freely and cordially ex - pressed .

		In a well-written paper on the Causes of the American Civil War , inspired , it appears , by the historical work of Mr.
J. F. Rhodes	PERSON	, the author declares that '' perhaps of all the men born to the Anglo-Saxon race in the nineteenth century , Lincoln deserves the highest place in history . ''

		And in his essay on Lord
Granville	PERSON	he emphasizes the services of that statesman , in
1862	DATE	, in preventing the English government from assuming a hostile attitude toward the
United States	LOCATION	; and apropos of the Treaty of
Washington	LOCATION	-LRB- 1871 -RRB- he makes the statement that
Lord Granville	PERSON	, '' when he left the foreign office in
1874	DATE	... had given his country the gjreatest boon which it had ever received from any Foreign Minister : the assurance of peace with the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		All the papers are interesting and readable -- excellent specimens of the author 's genial style .

		The subjects are largely political , but not exclusively so : the paper on the Dining Societies of
London	LOCATION	has no political interest , and the sketch of the diplomatic activities of the Russian `` ambassadress , '' Madame de
Lieven	PERSON	, should probably be classed as biograph - ical .

		But the essays dealing with
George Savile	PERSON	,
Godolphin	ORGANIZATION	, the
Croker Papers	ORGANIZATION	, and the History of the Cabinet , are popular discussions of problems in English history and politics written with the ease of one who is master of subject and style .

		Forces and tendencies of society .

		The words `` Modernism and Ro - mance '' give the title of a volume from the pen of Mr.
R. A. Scott	PERSON	- James , and are fairly descriptive of the contents .

		The whole is intended to form a continuous argu - ment ; and various authors and books are selected '' as examples of certain intellectual or emotional forces which are working in our midst and are moulding the psychical organism of society . ''

		There are sixteen chapters , with such captions as '' Science and Vandalism , '' '' The Decadents , '' '' The Apostles of Protest , '' and '' The New Romance . ''

		In each chapter he discusses representative authors ; thus , under '' The Fugitives '' he writes of
Laf	ORGANIZATION	cadio
Hearn	PERSON	, Miss
Edith Durham	PERSON	,
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, and
Jack London	PERSON	; under '' The Self-Conscious Poet , '' of Mr.
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	, Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, and Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	.

		His criticism is a good example of the theme of his closing chapter , '' The Personal Note in Criticism , '' in the course of which he says : `` The effort to put off the convention of form and rely upon the trained faculty of insight may indeed result in foolish judgments from the foolish , but it will give us wise judgments from the wise . ''

		The individual essays in the book are bright as well as thoughtful , although one must often differ from the writer 's opinions , literary or other .

		For example , it is surely a rather intrepid and extreme admirer who would now say of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	that '' he was probably the first among Englishmen who realised the sterner foundations of Japanese character . ''

		England has hardly based her political relations with
Japan	LOCATION	on the lighter side of the Japanese character , or depended on Mr.
Hearn	PERSON	for initial knowledge of her interesting Asiatic ally .

		Judging the volume as a whole , we must feel , despite the many meritorious parts and frequency of suggestive or even stimulating passages , that the author has not achieved the unity and comprehensiveness for which the title and introduction led us to hope .

		But every thoughtful reader wiU appreciate the value of any sane attempt to connect scattered works with general tendencies .

		-LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Those already familiar with the plays More of the Irish # ^ ^ wiUiam
B. Yeats	PERSON	will need no literary drama .

		.

		words to direct them to '' The Uni - corn from the Stars , and Other Plays '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There will , perhaps , be readers of '' The Celtic Twi - light '' and '' The Secret Rose '' who have not read '' The Land of Heart 's Desire '' or '' The Countess Cathleen '' ; and to these we may say that in this volume of plays Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	presents in a new form some of the motives of his earlier work .


Cathleen ni Houlihan	PERSON	, for instance , was one of the subjects of song of Hanrahan the Red , in the days when he lived in the
Burrough	PERSON	with
Margaret Rooney	PERSON	and her crony
Mary Gillis	PERSON	.

		But there are also those who have but a vague idea of Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	and his dramatic work .

		For such outsiders we will say that one of the phases of the
Celtic Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	has been the revival of a national drama in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The movement is not old : we believe that it was about
1900	DATE	when the Irish Literary Theatre was founded , for which Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	and others wrote plays that generally put forward the conception of national
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Readers will also remember '' The Bending of the Bough , '' by Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		The present volume includes three plays written for the successor to the Irish Literary Theatre , two by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	, and the one that gives its name to the volume , by himself and Lady
Gregory	PERSON	.

		We believe that '' The Hour Glass '' and `` Cathleen 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ni Houlihan '' have been published before ; but '' The Unicorn from the Stars '' was only given last year .

		Of these plays we can hardly attempt a criti - cism in a few words .

		They are an approximation to an Irish folk-drama , using popular Irish tales as material and popular Irish language as means .

		And they are really popular Irish , not the conventional idea of it that many of us may have in mind .

		The plays impress us as having little dramatic character : we should say that they conveyed their idea chiefly by symbol rather than by action .

		For , like all neo - Celticism , they are symbolic , or at least always have the aroma of symbolism .

		We like to read and enjoy them , rather than criticize them .

		A little book with a long title is Dr. ana cZ7 , : T
Thomas Valentine Parker	PERSON	's on `` The Cherokee Indians ; with Special Ref - erence to their Relations with the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	, '' which has appeared in the '' Grafton Historical Series . ''

		In a little more than a hundred pages , the author gives a sketch of the history of the Cherokees from the beginning of their relations with the white settlers of
North America	LOCATION	to the
Federal	ORGANIZATION	legislation of
1902	DATE	.

		The narrative is inter - esting , if somewhat annalistic ; and the facts are generally accurate .

		In a work of this size , con - densation is necessary and desirable ; but Dr.
Parker	PERSON	's methods of selection have led him to present rather a brief against the governments of
Georgia	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	for their misdeeds in connection with the Cherokees than a scientific treatment of an important phase of American his - tory .

		In the broader relations of the Indian ques - tion , the book is very weak .

		There is no index , but a bibliography is added , which , like the text , is somewhat remarkable in its inclusions and omissions .

		Thus , one finds an enumeration by years of the several annual '' Reports of Indian Commissioner , '' from
1860	DATE	to
1902	DATE	, while an obscure reference to '' Fifth Annual Report , Bureau of Ethnology '' is the only recognition of Dr.
Royce	PERSON	's valuable mono - graph , to which Dr.
Parker	PERSON	might wisely have been more generous of acknowledgment .

		There is an imposing array of references to
Congressional Documents	ORGANIZATION	by their serial numbers ; but confidence is somewhat shaken when one discovers such an omission as that of the correspondence concerning the emigration of the Indians , contained in
Senate	ORGANIZATION	Document No. 512 , parts 1-5 ,
23rd Congress	ORGANIZATION	,
First Session	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Parker	PERSON	's text , however , though par - tisan in tone , is a good popular introduction to the subject of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	's dealings with the Cherokees ; and this , doubtless , is the place which the author has wished that it should fill .

		In an isolated desert-rimmed plateau LtelZZTo .

		`` '' ^ ^ `` ° `` ^ th edge of the
Grand CaSon of Arizona	LOCATION	, two hundred and fifty miles from
Flagstaff	LOCATION	'' and only two drinks on the trail , '' there lives a man who has spent his long life in the pursuit of wild animals .

		He has hunted every well-known wild beast of western North Amer - ica , and he has never killed anything except when the necessity of getting a living or of defending human life drove him to it .

		The fun of hunting for him is not in killing , but in capturing and taming his prey .

		His greatest achievement is represented by the herd of buffalo that browse on his range .

		Intent upon saving the vanishing race , he spent ten years , in the seventies , hunting , capturing , and taming the animals that became the founders of his herd ; and his success brought him fame and the sobriquet of '' Buffalo Jones . ''

		A
summer	DATE	or two ago .

		Dr.
Zane Grey	PERSON	accompanied the veteran fron - tiersman on a cougar hunt , with a visit to the buffalo farm and a round-up of wild mustang thrown in .

		In '' The Last of the Plainsmen '' -LRB-
Outing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Dr.
Grey	PERSON	has told the story of the lion-hunt at first hand , in - terspersing with it the camp-fire tales he heard of other of his host 's adventures .

		Chief among these are the account of the memorable day when he roped eight buffalo calves , -- whereas it had generally taken him weeks to get one , -- and of the musk-ox hunt in the Barren Lands , when hard-won success was turned to failure at the last minute by the treachery of the northern Indians .

		Out of his long experience Mr.
Jones	PERSON	reaches the verdict that '' the tame wild animal is the most dangerous of beasts , '' that it takes years to understand any animal 's mode of reasoning -- an indispensable requisite to dealing with it , -- and that conquering by kindness is an empty phrase as applied to wild things .

		Dr.
Grey	PERSON	is an enthusiastic sportsman , alive to the pictur - esqueness both of Western scenery and Western character .

		He is also a skilful photographer of still life , and has furnished many interesting pictures of the country in which he hunted .

		One of the most remarkable charac - Stirrirw tales of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ gj .

		romantic period of
Great Ralegh	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		, .

		, , .

		^ • o - - nr li .

		r > ^ u English history is Sir
Walter Ralegh	PERSON	.

		The facts of his life furnish forth a tale as stirring as any of our novels of adventure and daring .

		We have in him the love of the sea , with all its mystery and tragedy , the reaching forth into the unknown with , at that time , its boundless possibilities , the actual adventure with suspicious Indians and hostile Spaniards , and the final conflict with unscrupulous enemies at home reaching even to the cowardly occupant of the throne .

		So , too , we have the won - derful charm of the man , which appealed equally to the Indian in his native wilderness and to the great Queen herself , his conscientiousness which led directly to the scaffold , his stern sense of duty , and his simple piety .

		Such is the man admirably pre - sented in his latest biography ,
Hugh de Sflincourt	PERSON	's `` Great Ralegh '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Even though the book is written for the general reader with its caveat for '' scholasticus '' -- usually a warning to be heeded by both learned and laity -- the liveli - ness with which the story is told will recommend it to one already familiar with the facts .

		A graphic picture is given of `` the spacious times of great
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 257 Elizabeth , '' and the heavy change under the con - temptible James .

		The record of
Ralegh	ORGANIZATION	's trial , his last and ill-fated expedition , and his magnificent death , still grips one as if the story were not as familiar as a twice-told tale .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Of the political figures of the last century that con - tinue to loom large on the national stage , one of the most interesting is that of
John C. Calhoun	PERSON	the great Nullifier .

		An excellent account of his political career has been written for the '' American Crisis Biographies '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Gaillard Hunt	PERSON	, showing clearly the development of
Calhoun	PERSON	's opinions and of his hold upon the South , imtil he became a man of one idea and the political dictator of his section .

		An interesting phase of
Calhoun	PERSON	's development is his change from a strong national theory of government and vigorous activity as a national statesman , to the extreme States-rights theory as the author and responsible leader of the movement for practical nullification .

		This change and the reasons for it are clearly brought out by Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	, whose treatment of his subject is marked by sympathy and intelligence .

		While the work does not show the bril - liancy that made Von Hoist 's similar biography so notable twenty-five years ago , its fairness to all parties makes it more trustworthy .

		The
Library of the University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	has issued a little '' Handbook '' -LRB- of vest-pocket proportions , or very nearly -RRB- which gives interestmg facts , historical and descriptive , concerning this veritable phoenix of a library that has twice risen from its ashes within the last dozen years .

		That the Trustees had caught the true library spirit as early as half a century ago is shown by the fact that '' when in
1858	DATE	it became neces - sary to close the
University	ORGANIZATION	because of lack of funds , provision was made to care for the library during the interim and to replenish it ` as circimistances may require . ' ''

		Noteworthy is it that even this library for serious and responsible readers and students is a closed - shelf and not an open-shelf library -- except at the librarian 's discretion . ''

		A
Spanish Reader for Beginners	ORGANIZATION	in High Schools and Colleges , '' by Professor Charles
Alfred Tyrrell	PERSON	is sent us by the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who also publish a text of
Seiiora Avellaneda	PERSON	's '' Baltasar , '' edited by Dr.
Carlos Bransby	PERSON	.

		This remarkable Biblical drama in verse is the work of a Spanish woman of Cuban birth , who died in
1873	DATE	, and whose varied writings occupy a high place in contemporary Spanish Uterature .

		Dr.
Bransby	PERSON	's introduction to this edition is of much value .

		Messrs.
D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of a text of
Valera	ORGANIZATION	's `` Pepita
Jim <	PERSON	`` nez , '' edited by Mr.
G. L. Lincoln	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately , the text is abridged , which fact considerably qualifies our satisfaction m its present publication .

		A book much after the manner and purport of Samuel Smiles s '' Self-Help '' is that by the Rev.
Madison C. Peters	PERSON	entitled '' The Strenuous Career , or Short Steps to Success '' -LRB-
Laird & Lee	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The vohmae is packed with edifying examples of worldly success attained in the face of obstacles ; and these are strung together on a thread of good common-sense moralizing .

		The author warns his readers that the fruits of success turn to ashes in the mouth unless the success sought be a high and worthy one .

		True success , he points out , '' lies not in getting what you desire , but in achieving that which will elevate and ennoble yourself and at the same time confer some benefit on your kind , -- a success which will be measiu-ed by its contribution to the world 's welfare and happiness . ''

		The combination of worldly wisdom with sound moral standards , which the author shows , makes the book a safe and helpful one to put in the hands of aspiring youths .

		Under the general title of ' The

		These volumes may be roughly described as forming a kind of storehouse of documents , the purpose of which is to carry the reader into
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's workshop and make him a sharer in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own atmosphere .

		What books did he use as he pondered the construction of one of his dramas ?

		What was the form of that drama as it actually left his hand ?

		These and kindred questions are answered by the series , in which some twelve or fifteen volumes have already appeared .

		Incidentally the student is afforded light on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time , and the manners and moods of his contemporaries .

		It would be difficult to exaggerate the value of these books .

		They are not , of course , unfamiliar to scholars , but on the other hand , they have not hitherto been collected in such convenient and inexpensive form and thereby made so easily accessible to a large circle of readers . ''

		There is little profit in recalling the storm of ridicule and abuse that burst forth when the book was first published .

		Many of those who publicly denounced the work and its author have since retracted their first opinion and have acknowledged that it was based on an imperfect understanding of Professor Thomas 's meaning .

		That there should have been such a misunderstanding is in itself a surprising fact , since the book is written with extraordinary clearness and vividness .

		Few books of a strictly scientific character can be read with so much pleasure and profit by the intelligent layman .

ELIOT NORTON	PERSON	.

		The life of colonial
New England	LOCATION	, resting upon the granite of puritan character , was richly provided with the elements of sincerity and strength , but was singularly devoid of the qual - ity of charm .

		Two centuries of weathering were needed to disintegrate the rock , and cover it with a soil in which culture might take root and flourish .

		When the time came , the soil proved richly fruitfiJ , and from it sprang the fine flowers of ethical order and exalted patriotism , of aesthetic feeling and literary art .

		With that efflorescence of the spirit of man in the new world ,
America	LOCATION	first achieved a literature of its own , and adorned its annals with the names of
Bryant	PERSON	and
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	, of Haw - thorne and
Lowell	PERSON	and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		As com - pared with these names , the name of the quiet scholar who passed away at
Cambridge	LOCATION	on the twenty-first of
October	DATE	was less resounding in the world of publicity , but it does not seem too much to say that in penetrative influence upon American character the man who bore it was the peer of any of his contemporaries .

		We can think of no man who has embodied more fully and satisfactorily than
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	the distinctive qualities of that idealism toward which we still believe , despite all discourage - ments , that our best self as a nation aspires .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	was born
November 16 , 1827	DATE	, and consequently lived until his eighty-first year was all but completed .

		The trees of Shady Hill that waved over his cradle were the trees that filled the air with autumnal murmurs as he drew his last breath ; for he was one of the few who in this country of ours have the double fortune of living to venerable age and of dying under the roof - tree that sheltered their infancy .

		The fact may be taken as symbolical of the steadfast continuity with which his fourscore years were devoted , with a singleness of purpose imderlying all their variety of occupation , to the pursuit of essential virtue and truth and beauty .

		It was in or near his
Cambridge	LOCATION	home that he labored all the years of his active life , save for his brief period of faring abroad on business in early manhood , for his occasional European sojourns , and for his many summers at
Ashfield	LOCATION	, among the hills of western
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		And for the 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1 , last half	DATE	- century Shady Hill has been sought out by the wise and good of other lands as the Mecca of their American pilgrimage , and by the fellow-countrymen , old and young , of the sage who lived there , for the sake of its gracious hospitality , and the inspiration of personal con - tact with its master .

		As the son of
Andrews Norton	PERSON	, himself iden - tified with the college for fifty years , Charles naturally became a son of
Harvard	LOCATION	, and was graduated with the class of
1846	DATE	, at the age of nineteen .

		Among his classmates were Child and Lane -LRB- later his colleagues -RRB- ,
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	and
George Frisbie Hoar	PERSON	.

		The first few years after his graduation were spent in business , and in
1849	DATE	he went on a voyage to the
East Indies	LOCATION	as supercargo .

		But the commercial life did not attract him , and he soon took up his studies again .

		He found his chief interest in the his - tory of art , and this subject necessarily took him to
Europe	LOCATION	for considerable periods .

		It was upon one of these European trips -LRB- in the mid - fifties -RRB- that he made
Ruskin	PERSON	's acquaintance , in the cabin of an excursion boat making the trip from
Vevay	LOCATION	to
Geneva	LOCATION	.

		The account of this meeting , as given in
Ruskin	PERSON	's '' Praeterita , '' is 80 charming that we wiU quote from it at some length . ''

		I noticed that from time to time the young Amer - ican cast somewhat keen , though entirely courteous , looks of scrutiny at my father and mother . ''

		In a few minutes after I had begun to notice these looks , he rose , with the sweetest quiet smile I ever saw on any face -LRB- imless , perhaps , a nun 's when she has some grave kindness to do -RRB- , crossed to our side of the cabin , and addressing himself to my father , said , with a true expression of great gladness , and of frank trust that his joy would be understood , that he knew who we were , was most thankful to have met us , and that he prayed permission to introduce his mother and sisters to us . ''

		The bright eyes , the melodious voice , the simple , but acutely flattering , words , won my father in an in - stant .

		The New Englander sat down beside us , his mother and sisters seeming at once also to change the steamer 's cabin into a reception room in their own home .

		The rest of the time till we reached
Geneva	LOCATION	passed too quickly ; we arranged to meet in a day or two again , at
St. Martin 's	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		And thus I became possessed of my second friend , after Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	; and of my first real tutor , Charles
Eliot Norton	PERSON	. ''

		The meeting at
St. Martin	ORGANIZATION	's
Avith Norton	PERSON	and his family was a very happy one .

		Entirely sensible and amiable , all of them ; with the further elasticity and acuteness of the American intellect , and no taint of American ways .

		Charles himself , a man of the highest natural gifts , in their kind ; observant and critical , rather than imaginative , but with an all-pervading sympathy and sensibility , absolutely free from envy , ambition , or covetousness ; a scholar from his cradle , nor only now a man of the world , but a gentleman of the world , whom the highest born and best bred of every nation , from the Red Indian to the White Austrian , would recognize in a moment , as of their caste . ''

		This characterization by a man of genius leaves little to be said , and serves particularly to illustrate that faculty for friendship which drew into Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's intimacy many of the choicest spirits of his time .

		It would be interesting , did our space permit , to extend the quotation by Ruskins whimsical speculations as to '' what sort of soul
Charles Norton	PERSON	would have become , if he had had the blessing to be born an English Tory , or a Scotch Jacobite , or a French Gentilhomme , or a
Savoyard Count	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		For the writer makes it very clear that his new friend does not belong to
America	LOCATION	, being '' as hopelessly out of gear and place , over in the
States	LOCATION	there , as a runaway star dropped into Purgatory . ''

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's early connection with
Harvard	LOCATION	as a teacher took the form of an instructorship in
1851	DATE	and of a lectureship in 1863-4 .

		It was not until ten years after this that he entered into his lasting relations with the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Meanwhile , he married Miss
Susan Sedgwick	PERSON	in
1862	DATE	, and in the same year joined with Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	in editing '' The North American Re - view , '' an occupation which busied him for six years .

		He was also one of Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's asso - ciates in the early years of '' The Nation '' -LRB- begun in
1865	DATE	-RRB- , and during the years of the Civil War just preceding he acted as secretary of the
Loyal Publication Society	ORGANIZATION	, compiling broadsides which strengthened the patriotic heart of the people in their struggle to preserve the nation .

		Even earlier than all this , he had been influential in bringing about the establishment of '' The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' and was one of the con - tributors to its first number .

		Besides these literary activities , he had also found time to write two books , '' Considerations on Some Recent Social Theories , '' and '' Notes of Travel and Study in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' dated
1853	DATE	and
1859	DATE	respectively .

		It was , then , with no mean record of scholarly achievement and public service that Mr.
Norton	PERSON	, in
1874	DATE	, at the age of forty-six , accepted the chair offered him at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	by his cousin the President .

		The chair was created for him , and he was styled Professor of the History of Art , but he interpreted art in a broad sense , and found in it as many implications as his friend
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		It has been happily said that his real academic function was to serve as Professor of Things in
General	ORGANIZATION	, by which is meant simply that his conception of art was so liberal , his sense of the inter-relationship of all cultural and social interests so lively , that he could not nar -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAl ^ 279 row his work to the mere discussion of aesthetic technicalities , but was perforce constrained to take within his purview all the deeper concerns of human existence .

		He so vitalized the aca - demic spirit of the institution that he became easily its most popular teacher , and his class - rooms were filled to overflowing .

		His winning manner , and the finished style of his discourse proved so attractive to the eager and ingenuous young men who thronged to his lectures that it became a problem to provide them with accom - modation , and it was finally found necessary to reduce their numbers by restricting the courses to upper classmen .

		During the twenty-four years of his regular teaching , nearly all the stu - dents who went through Harvard were found in his classes at one time or another .

		It would be difficult to overestimate the extent of the influ - ence which he thus exerted upon a whole gener - ation of college students -- an influence always exerted for sanity and restraint , for a correct appreciation of art and for the understanding of its correlation with life .

		As President
Eliot	PERSON	once said : '' Thousands of Harvard students attribute to his influence lasting improvements in their modes of thought , their intellectual and moral interests , and their ideas of genuine suc - cess and true happiness . ''

		The only book that resulted from these courses on the history of art was published in
1880	DATE	, and was entitled '' Historical Studies of Church-Building in the Middle Ages . ''

		During the eighties , he added to his work courses on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, imparting the results of his life-long study of the poet .

		As early as
1865	DATE	, he had joined with
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	in establishing a little
Dante Club	ORGANIZATION	in
Cambridge	LOCATION	, which met
Wednesday	DATE	evenings , largely for the discussion of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's translation then in active preparation .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's own little book on the ''
Vita Nuova	PERSON	'' -LRB- an essay with trans - lations -RRB- had appeared in
1859	DATE	, and his complete version of the work came out in
1867	DATE	, accom - panying his colleague 's version of the '' Divina Commedia . ''

		His own prose translation of the Comedy was given to the world in 1891-2 .

		Not long afterwards he delivered a course of lectures on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	on the
Percy Turnbull Foundation	ORGANIZATION	at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		These lectures have never been published , and it should be one of the first duties of his literary executors to see that they are made into a book .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's editorial labors in connection with
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Lowell	PERSON	, and
Curtis	PERSON	are not the least of his claims upon our gratitude .

		After
Fronde	PERSON	's mangled version of the
Carlyle	PERSON	correspondence , the family turned to Mr.
Norton	PERSON	for redress , and there resulted '' The Corre - spondence of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and Emerson '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- , '' The Correspondence of
Carlyle	PERSON	and Goethe '' -LRB- 1887 -RRB- , and ''
Carlyle	PERSON	's Letters and
Reminis	PERSON	- cences '' -LRB- 1887 -RRB- .

		For the authorized ``
Brant	PERSON	- wood '' American edition of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, extending to about a score of volumes , but unfortunately far from complete , he wrote the prefatory essays in the several volumes .

		He was
Lowell	PERSON	's literary executor , and gave us -LRB- 1893 -RRB- the '' Letters of James
Russell Lowell	PERSON	'' in two volumes .

		A year later , he had prepared the three volumes of '' Orations and Addresses '' by
George William Curtis	PERSON	, who was also one of his closest friends .

		He had a true genius for friendship , as these instances show , and as is also revealed in the published correspondence of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, and
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	, to name only a few other examples .

		These warm relationships with his famous contemporaries have sometimes led to the ill-natured and unjust assumption that his reputation rests upon a parasitical basis .

		But no one who reads the letters which these men wrote to him could hold that opinion in good faith , or fail to discern the modest self-effacement which characterized his relations with them .

		An important part of Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's life is connected with the town of
Ashfield	LOCATION	, in western
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, where , with
Curtis	PERSON	for a neigh - bor , he made his
summer	DATE	Ijome for over forty years .

		He identified himself with the civic life of that little community of a thousand souls , and inspired it with his own ideals of good citizenship .

		His influence revived the moribund Academy of the town , and the institution of the
Ashfield	LOCATION	dinners , held annually in the town hall for a quarter of a century , made the place known the country over .

		He presided at these dinners , and when the homely fare had been disposed of , and the material man was at peace with the world , the spiritual man took his place , and discussed questions of high social and political import , under the leadership of the beloved pre - siding officer , and of the distinguished guests whom he had brought there to speak . ''

		Ichabod '' is now the word for
Ashfield	LOCATION	, but it will long remain an inspiring memory .

		It was during the year of our wicked war with
Spain	LOCATION	and of our national orgy of iniquit - ous imperialism that
Ashfield	LOCATION	became best known to the country .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	had no doubts upon the moral issues then involved , and no hesitation in condemning the course taken by his country in those disastrous years .

		His Ash - field address of
August 25 , 1898	DATE	, stirred up a 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, storm of excitement , and brought upon his head the sort of villification which is always the lot of the far-sighted patriot who dares rebuke his fellow-citizens for their lapse from virtue .

		As early as
June	DATE	of that year , when he had just retired from his Harvard duties , and accepted the title of Professor Emeritus , he had spoken upon the same subject in
Cambridge	LOCATION	with no uncertain voice .

		He had said in closing : '' My friends ,
America	LOCATION	has been compelled against the will of all her wisest and best to enter into a path of dar ness and peril .

		Against their will she has been forced to turn back from the way of civilization to the way of barbarism , to renounce for the time her own ideals .

		With grief , with anxiety must the lover of his country regard the present aspect and the future prospect of the nation 's life .

		With serious purpose , with utter self-devotion he should prepare himself for the untried and difficult service to which it is plain he is to be called in the quick-coming years . ''

		The wisdom and sanity of that utterance will sometime receive general recognition .

		It was then the wisdom of a minority , but the decade that has since elapsed already shows signs of a reaction in the sense of that deliverance , and the '' untried and difficult service '' henceforth to be required of American citizenship will be more and more accepted as an obligation in the days to be .

		The man who takes this position in the face of the angry Demos is sure to be called a pessi - mist , and the title is a badge of honor .

		The pessimists -LRB- in this sense -RRB- are about the only persons who have done any real good in the world .

		To Mr.
Norton	PERSON	, the storm-cloud that burst in
1898	DATE	had long been gathering .

		Sev - eral years before he had written , in a private letter , of '' these dark days when the advocates of culture and the maintainance of morality in politics find their best type in Mrs.
Partington	PERSON	, '' and had added : '' At any rate , let us use our brooms as briskly as we can till the tide quite drowns us out . ''

		But , however disheartened he grew under the pressure of events , he never lost faith in the future .

		And once writing to
Godkin	PERSON	, he spoke of `` the good old cause of civilization -- the cause which is always de - feated , but always after defeat taking more advanced positions than ever before . ''

		In his eightieth year , he said to a friend that if life were to be lived over again he thought , for his part , that he would like to live it in
Chicago	LOCATION	, because he seemed to see working there , in all the welter of vulgarity and commercialism , a power for good that would in time come to its own .

		Such hopefidness as that is surely no mark of pessimism in any rational meaning of the term .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	received honors that were fairly commensurate with his deserts .

		He was awarded the doctorate by numerous universities , includ - ing both
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		His name was one to conjure with wherever scholarship was held in esteem .

		His permanent memorial in
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is the Library which bears his name , provided by a fund collected in
1905	DATE	from over five hundred subscribers , and having as a nu - cleus his own private collection of books .

		Two things remain to be done in his further honor .

		One is the preparation of an adequate biography ; the other is the collection of his widely-scattered writings .

		Of the first , we need only say that the recipient of such letters , addressed to him by such men as
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	,
Stephen	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and
Godkin	PERSON	, as have already been pub - lished , must have given in measure no less rich than he received , and that the epistolary material for a biography is sure to be abundant .

		Of the second , we would urge that
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	belongs to American literature , and that his rightf id place among our authors is to be secured and perpetuated only by making generally acces - sible to readers the large mass of his writing now concealed in the files of periodicals , in editorial contributions to other men 's books , and in his unpublished manuscripts .

		This pious duty should be entered upon at once , and its performance based upon the principle that what - ever such a man had to say must be worth preserving .

		CABBAGES AND ROSES .

		The trend of modern thought has been to assert that cabbages are as admirable as roses -- nay , that they are superior ; for we can eat cabbages , whereas , like Du
Maurier	PERSON	's poor musician , we do not habitu - ally `` lif on roses . ''

		In almost all contemporary criticism this utilitarian idea crops up .

		We ought to admire , we are told , the creations of the modern fiction-monger , because he gives us people who are of use in the world -- farmers , fishermen , doctors , engineers ; because these are , as a rule , models of unselfish conduct , paragons who do their whole duty in this life .

		How superior they are , how much better fitted for our guidance and imitation , than the self-centred , imperious saviors or destroyers of mankind , the lords of ideal fiction , -- Prometheus , Achilles , Hamlet ,
Lear	PERSON	, and their like !

		The old literature saw everywhere hierarchies of spiritual and intellectual beings , of animate and in - animate objects .

		Some incarnations of humanity were greater , wiser , more splendid than others ; some natural objects were more beautiful and per - fect than the rest .

		The idea of fitness and appro -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 priateness pervaded art .

		The heroines
Ophelia	ORGANIZATION	or Belvidera had to go mad in white satin : now we put her in a patched frock and sabots .

		It is certain that we are , all of us , striving for wealth , power , distinction , or rule .

		We prefer mansions to hovels , athletes to cripples , beautiful women to homely ones .

		The shop-girl dreams of being a duchess ; the salesman imagines himself a hero .

		Why should not this universal , this saving instinct of mankind for what it deems the best find expression in literature ?

		It has always done so before , and the finest figures of fiction are the em - bodiments of this human worship of greatness and beauty .

		The extremes of life are the regions of supreme art .

		On the one side are the princes and poten - tates and powers and dominations of the world .

		It is hardly necessary to say that these need not be born in the purple , -- but they must have heads upon which crowns of some kind naturally fall .

		On the other side are the creatures of the gulf and gloom , dark apparitions of poverty , madness , rebel - lion , and despair .

		Great art bridges the distance between these opposite worlds ; it strides easily from
Hyperion	LOCATION	's palace to Job 's dunghill ; from lUyria 's court to the tavern where
Burns	PERSON	's Jolly Beggars are congregated ; it discovers in one work Lear on his throne dealing out kingdoms , and the same person - age crouching on the ground defenseless against the outrage of the elements .

		In the one case the artist deals with beauty and grandeur , -- and poetry and romance come easily to him .

		In the other case he works with shadow and horror , and power is ready made to his hands .

		In both cases the subject is given to him and he has only to prove himself equal to it .

		But there is a vast extent of life where the sub - ject is not given to the artist , where he has , by mere handling , to make significant and interesting the ordinary and common happenings of mankind .

		This is the region of social comedy and the modern novel .

		Moli ^ re 's work would be mainly of this kind were it not that the gods descend from their heights in the
Misanthrope	LOCATION	, and the gulf surges up from below in
Don Juan	LOCATION	,
Tartuffe	LOCATION	, and the Miser .

		Re - acted upon by humor , this middle region of life can become a spectacle of power ; painted merely for itself , it is likely to be monotonous , insipid , flat .


Vanessa	PERSON	said that Dean Swift could write beauti - fully about a broomstick .

		Our modern novelists do not often write as well as Swift , but their task is essentially to make something out of nothing -- to dress up the broomsticks of ordinary life so that they shall seem animated and strong .

		It is creditable to their skill that they do very frequently produce such an illusion , but somehow their work has the trick of fading away before that of the creators who take the good the gods provide in the shape of great characters and actions .

		For there is a difference in the quality of actions .

		These take color and grandeur from their settings and surroundings .

		Generally , things done , spec - tacles presented on the stage of the world , are more impressive in the eye of mankind than those enacted in suburbs or purlieus .

		A young girl who works to support an aged mother or a crippled brother may have a heart as pure , a devotion as high , as
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	; but the depth of spiritual monitions , the pomp of state and war , the terror of a fiery doom , lift the French maiden out of all comparison with humbler fates .

		Modern writers are almost all humanitarians .

		It is an honor to their hearts that they are so -- that they have taken up the cause of the down-trodden , the forgotten , the average human being .

		They have said to themselves that love and joy and pain and death are universal , -- that there is no reason why a poor young clerk should not love with the passion of a Romeo , why a deserted girl of the streets should not feel as deeply as
Marguerite	PERSON	, why any mother mourning over her dead should not be as great a figure as
Niobe	ORGANIZATION	or Rizpah .

		And there is perhaps no reason , except that of fitness , if the author feels competent to supply three-fourths of the capital stock in such characters .

		If he feels that he can afford to throw away subject and rely en - tirely on handling , there is no reason why he should not do so .

		For while sensation , feeling , emotion are univer - sal , intellect is not universal .

		I am willing to con - cede that average or inferior human beings feel as deeply as beings of a higher grade ; but they can - not express their feelings .

		They are inarticulate ; and art , which is expression , rules out the inarticu - late .

		Romeo is Romeo because of the magnificence with which he utters the litany of love .

		A Mar - guerite who could not sing of the King in
Thule	LOCATION	, or plead with her lover about religion , or utter the wonderful sentences of the dungeon scene , would be a failure .

		A Lear or a Timon without their kingly splendor of thought and speech would be incon - ceivable .

		But the modern novelist may say that he can dower his average or inferior character with thought and language of his own .

		Even if he can , there is the question of fitness .

		Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the extremes of action and thought and speech which go to make up a great character in fiction would be ridiculous if brought into the milieu of the middle class .

		The whole matter comes round to a question of subject .

		Are there any subjects , actions , themes , better than others ?

		Are there any kind of person - ages more suited to exploitation in literature than the common ruck of mankind ?

		Are there any surroundings -- grandeurs or splendors of scenery , sunsets , storms , moonlight magnificences , architec - tural backgrounds , palaces , gardens , and the like -- which help and heighten a work of art ?

		In short , is there any real difference between cabbages and roses ?

		In one of the first and perhaps one of the most important of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's critical pieces , the preface to his Early Poems , he deals with this ques - tion .

		The essay is a revolt against the mannered 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov.	DATE	i ; detailed modern work in poetry -- all foreground -- and an appeal for the large masses and outlines of the ancients .

		Seize a great action , he tells the poet ; approximate language will follow .

		It will -- if the author is filled with the power of his theme , capable of being thrilled by its significance .

		Great actions are usually the results of great causes ; they take place among those who have that stamp of intellec - tual superiority which , far more than emotional agita - tion , is the mark of the highest type of literary creation .

		Emotion must exist in them , but it must find vent in deeds and words which denote mental power .

		The modern novelist , in painting the average man and woman , is necessarily debarred from great actions .

		His sense of fitness keeps him from put - ting into the mouths of his characters that concen - trated intellectual speech which was the privilege of the poets of the past .

		He tries to make up for these deficiencies by the analysis of character and of moods of mind .

		But just so far as he pushes this , his figures lose validity and vitality .

		They are seen to be puppets moved by himself -- or , at the best , dissections of dead souls .

		Life seen near at hand is mostly detail .

		The trivial , the unimportant , the commonplace , do not fall away and leave the masses and the meanings of the scene apparent .

		Real contemporary life , there - fore , would seem to be suited mainly to comedy and social satire .

		Not until we get away from the foot - hills do the great mountains loom up .

		It is not that the heroic age is past -- that there are no great souls , mighty intellef.ts , wonderful actions , magnifi - cent settings for deed and character to-day .

		All these things doubtless crowd the world .

		But just as the singular and superb figures and actions which gleam to us out of the past were in their own time obscured by rivals or inferiors , so with us our best is hidden and hustled away in the multitude of happenings .

		In this sense it may be said that the commonplace is the uncommon which has not yet been tested by time and space .

		Practically , the great artists of literature who have brooded deepest over life have affected the distant or the past for their creations .

		They were not foolish enough to doubt that human life is al - ways essentially the same ; they did not really believe in any Age of Gold , or Day of the Gods .

		But they knew that to evolve tragedy , romance , poetry , they must get away from the garish light of their own hour .

		All the great epic poems are pro- jections against the mists of antiquity .

		The great dramas are founded on traditions and legends of historical or immemorial past .

		Shakespeare has not one play of contemporary life -- or if the Italian Comedies are contemporary , they get from remote - ness what they lack in age .

		Again and again modern poets and romance writers have entered the grave of the past to resurrect it .

		Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	, the German Romanticists ,
Scott	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	-- one would have to call the roll of modern literature to name all who have , in the main , avoided their own day and their own native life .

		To be sure , there are exceptions .

		Per - haps Hugo 's Les Miserables is the most remarkable effort to find romance and tragedy at home .

		Is it successful ?

		And are the Realists -- the men and women of the last great revolt in literature , the artists who have refused to paint except direct from the model -- are they successful ?

		In comedy , in social satire , there can of course be no doubt : that is their province , and
Jane Austen	PERSON	and a hundred successors must live in letters .

		But in tragedy , in romance , have the Realists , the greatest of them , --
Balzac	LOCATION	,
Turgenieff	LOCATION	,
Zola	LOCATION	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, -- done anything that will last beside the work of the older schools ?

		Time alone can tell .

		Yet these authors have one of the sources of power that I have indicated above : they dive into the depths and draw forth its crea - tures of gloom and horror .

		They deal little with average fairly-contented or happy humanity .

		If anything saves them from posterity , it will be their pessimism .

Leonard Mooee	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		An educator and administrator of more THAN NATIONAL FAME was
Daniel Coit Gilman	PERSON	, whose recent death was briefly noted in our last issue .

		Although we are inclined to identify him chiefly with the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, of which he was the first president and whose destinies he controlled for a quarter-century , his leadership in other good causes and large enterprises was enough to make him famous .

		His first educational position , after a thorough training at home and abroad , was the librarianship at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, to which he was appointed in
1855	DATE	, at the age of twenty-four .

		But he soon transferred his interests and energies from the library to the class-room , being made professor of physical and political geography , and about the same time also secretary of the governing board of the
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two other offices , the superintendency of public schools and the sec - retaryship to the
State Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, fell to him before leaving New Haven , in
1872	DATE	, to assume the presidency of the
new University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		His acceptance ,
three years later	DATE	, of the task of shaping the first real university in this country , -- `` a place for the advanced special education of youth who have been prepared for its freedom by the discipline of a lower school , '' in Dr.
Gilman	PERSON	's own words , -- and his splendid success in building up an institution that soon ranked with the old uni - versities of
Europe	LOCATION	, are matters too familiar to need dwelling on here .

		The work of his last years as head of the Carnegie Institution at
Washington	LOCATION	, and his literary labors -- chief of which is his '' Life of
James Monroe	PERSON	'' in the American States - men Series -- are less familiar to the public .

		Curi - ously enough , and perhaps somewhat unfortunately .

		Dr.
Gilman	PERSON	's attention to matters of practical ad - ministration , to dealing with men and rubbing

		THE DIAL 283 elbows with the world , had developed in him a cast of countenance that bespoke shrewdness and hard common sense rather than profound learning and intimate acquaintance with the world of letters .

		Thus he sometimes failed of being credited with the scholarship , wide rather than deep , that he un - doubtedly possessed .

		, , , The iniquitous book publisher , that cruel taskmaster who grinds the faces of poor authors and stubbornly refuses to conduct his business solely for the glory of literary art and the speedy emolument of writer-folk , plies his shameful trade from
Greenland	LOCATION	's icy mountains to
India	LOCATION	's coral strand -LRB- with some allowance for poetic license -RRB- , and from where
Aurora	LOCATION	first tints with pink the
morning	TIME	sky to where Phoebus 's car descends afar in a blaze of glory into the western wave .

		The ``
Japan	LOCATION	Times '' prints an article deploring the yoke of poverty imposed by publishers on the necks of long-suffering authors , and announcing the forma - tion of an association for diverting the stream of yen now pouring into publishers ' pockets so that it shall henceforth empty into the purses of authors . ''

		The Association , '' the writer proceeds , in language that we take pleasure in reproducing unaltered , * ' has been mooted under the name ' Fushin-kai ' by Messrs.
Kikutei Taguchi	PERSON	,
Shunyo Yanagawa	PERSON	, and others .

		According to its prospectus , members shall produce one work each every year ; the copyright shall be preserved by
the Association	ORGANIZATION	, ten per cent of the proceeds from the sale of the book shall be granted to the author , and the remainder shall be appropriated to the funds of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The principal object of proceeding funds is to render re - lief to members . ''

		All very beautiful , but incom - plete .

		How about disastrous ventures ?

		Will ten per cent of the losses on an unsuccessful book be collected from the author and the remainder de - ducted from the '' proceeding funds '' of the Asso - ciation , or levied on its members ?

		And is there to be any censorship or control of the works that the members are expected , willy-nilly , to produce , '' one work each every year '' ?

		Brave schemes like this have flourished -LRB- in glowing prospectus -RRB- nearer home than
Japan	LOCATION	; but like the famous and -LRB- in all respects but one -RRB- admirable plan for belling the cat , their largeness of promise throws into total eclipse their meagreness of accomplishment .

		A German Oscar Wilde , in the person of
Franz Wedekind	PERSON	, is writing for the now world re - nowned '' Chamber Theatre '' in
Berlin	LOCATION	plays that are described as ultra-realistic , with strong lean - ings toward the erotic .

		The extreme realism is more properly Zolaesque , but interwoven are bits of epigram and repartee not unworthy of Oscar Wilde at his best .

		The theatre 's revolving stage , with its seven faces for successive presentation to the audience , makes possible a bewilderingly rapid change of scene ; so that many of
Herr Wedekind	PERSON	's plays resemble , in the shortness of the segments into which they are cut , the breathless and harrowing tales serially told in the cheap daily newspaper .

		Details of the realistic effects aimed at -LRB- and often hit -RRB- at the '' Chamber Theatre '' are given by Mr.
C. Valentine Williams	PERSON	in '' The Contemporary Re - view . ''

		The very rising of the curtain is attended with solemn ceremony .

		First a gong is sounded somewhere at the back of the stage , -- one heavy , booming note .

		The attendants glide noiselessly to the doors and close them ; the lights are slowly dimmed till darkness is produced ; then the gong sounds again , and with a soft rustle the green silk curtains divide , the drop rises , and the play begins .

		As the faintest ray of daylight would spoil the per - fect illusion , there are no matinees at the ''
Kam	PERSON	- merspielhaus '' ; and , moreover , calls before the cur - tain are forbidden , lest the charm should be broken .

		Besides
Wedekind	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	are played at this theatre . ''

		Ghosts '' is said to have been presented with a faithfulness of detail , a per - fection of acting , and a ruthlessness of subtle finesse , that were positively wrenching .

		On the whole , the reported plans and purposes of this
Berlin	LOCATION	enter - prise had raised hopes of rather better and worthier things than are now described by eye-witnesses .

		But the stage rarely rises to a level higher than the public on which it ` depends for support .

		The '' Chamber Theatre '' is unendowed , its managers are human , they have their bills to pay , -- so what could one expect ?

		, , ,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in Omarian quatrains would have at least , amid the countless translations of the
Divina Commedia	ORGANIZATION	, the quality of novelty .

		The Rev. Dr.
William Wilberforce Newton	PERSON	is said to be now en - gaged upon a new version of the poem , wherein he makes use of the four-line stanza rendered so fa - miliar to all the world by
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	and his imita - tors and parodists .

		Not the entire poem , however , is to be thus rendered , considerable portions being modelled somewhat after the plan of the Greek chorus .

		Will it be possible to read any of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's lines in the metre of Omar and still feel that one is reading Dante ?

		Take , for instance , the very open - ing stanzas , which Dr.
Newton	PERSON	has thus turned into English : '' Dark was the wood and devious was the way When in life 's journey towards the close of day , Midmost twixt youth and age , a stubborn path Beguiled ray feet that were not used to stray . ''

		How hard a thing in truth it is to tell The rough and cruel steps I took !

		The spell Of terror worse than death which o'er me hung The while I loitered in this wooded dell . ''

		Ah !

		hitter was that fear , enmeshed with Fate !

		E'en Death itself seemed like a kindlier state .

		Yet what I saw when from the light I turned , And all the good I found , I will relate . ''

		There is much that is novel in Dr.
Newton	PERSON	's plan of an English Dante , and we hope he will see fit to publish his work -- the occupation and recreation of many leisure hours ; but the feeling that he is in 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, some sense infringing on
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's patent must be more or less present with his readers .

		Such , at any rate , has been our feeling in reading the few excerpts which have come to our notice .

		• • • The army of unemployed or would-be NOVELISTS responded nobly to the hundred-guinea prixe lately offered by Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	, the Lon - don publisher , for the best first novel -LRB- first by its author -RRB- submitted to him .

		This offer is said to have brought forth a stream of type-written matter estimated at eighteen miles in length -- a result at once pitiful , pathetic , and amusing .

		Excepting a small fraction of a furlong , all those miles of inno - cent white paper , bescribbled with comedies and tragedies , with heroisms and villainies , with plots and counterplots , were to no purpose , except possi - bly to teach the deceitfulness of human hopes .

		The fortunate fraction , entitled '' The Woman and the Sword , '' is from the pen of one
Rupert Lorraine	PERSON	, who , by his coy reluctance to grant the publisher a personal interview , and by other marks of shyness , excites one 's suspicions that ''
Rupert Lorraine	PERSON	'' -LRB- happy commingling of Unguals and dentals , with one labial to give snap to the whole -RRB- may be a pseudonym , and also that the modestly shrinking
Rapert	PERSON	may be a woman .

		The story , however , whatever its authorship , is to be published very soon , and is to be made the basis of still further prize offers , -- for the best telegraphic criticism , not exceeding twelve words , of its merits -LRB- and de - fects ? -RRB-

		, for the best limerick inspired by its pages , and for the best imaginary portrait of the reticent Rupert ... MiscORRECTiONS OF MISQUOTATIONS are Some - times amusing ; but there is one in the
October	DATE	number of `` The Author '' that surprises and puz - zles more than it amuses .

		A correspondent , appar - ently well-read and not unused to handling a pen , takes issue with '' C. K. S. '' -LRB- even cis -
Atlantic	LOCATION	read - ers will recognize who is meant -RRB- on the literary ethics involved in a recent case in the English courts , and shows his approval of the court 's decis - ion that literary work should not be liable to `` re - hash on the part of irresponsible editors . ''

		The writer then adds : '' But the many lovers of Fitz - gerald must have squirmed at so hideous a misquo - tation as fell from the lips of the great litUrateur during the progress of the case ... ' Ah , take the cash in hand , and let the credit go , ' '
C. K. S.	PERSON	' was reported to have said , which does not so correctly interpret his attitude towards literary work as what
Fitzgerald	PERSON	really wrote : ' Ah , take the cash in hand , and waive the rest . ' ''

		If this last is a vari - ant reading of the third line of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's thir - teenth quatrain , it is certainly an unfamiliar one .

		This volunteered correction from one signing him - self '' Omar , '' together with the incorrect form of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's name , makes one wonder whether the Tent-maker and his English translator are al - ready falling into oblivion in
England	LOCATION	.

		An English reader of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	seems angered by the examples of misquoted poetry taken from a prominent
London	LOCATION	weekly and printed in a recent issue , and he retorts , with little logic and no signature , that the locution '' from whence , '' which appears in the same paragraph , is `` ignorant usage '' such as '' a third form schoolboy would be flogged '' if guilty of .

		The schoolboy might offer in defense that the phrase appears in the works of standard English authors , and that the
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	says of it : `` jPVom whence is fully authorized by good usage . ''

		But this would prob - ably increase , rather than allay , the anger of our pleonastic friend .

		DID ST. PETER `` PETER OUT '' ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Li your latest issue is a discussion of the source of the expression '' peter out . ''

		The dictionaries throw no light on the subject .

		Perhaps that is because the etymology of the phrase is so obvious , particularly to anybody who has a tolerable familiarity with the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		You will remember that

Chicago	LOCATION	,
October 20 , 1908	DATE	.

		THE ORIGIN OF `` PETER OUT . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In the matter of '' peter-out , '' passing the almost too obvious suggestion of
Peter	PERSON	's weakness at the trial of Jesus , for this recent phrase we seek a modern origin .

		Peter was a fisherman ; hence he was early taken as the patron saint of that craft .

		The guild of Fishmongers in
London	LOCATION	has the cross-keys of
St. Peter	ORGANIZATION	in its armorial bearings .

		It is not strange , then , if
Peter	PERSON	and fish are often found together in phrase and fable .

		The haddock is named in
France	LOCATION	morue de Saint
Pierre	PERSON	, bearing on his shoulders two dark spots that show where the saint pinched him when he took the tribute coin from his mouth ; and elsewhere the '' John-dory '' is a peterjish with the same tradition .

		Huntmg for an etymology in a Danish dictionary , I ran upon the singular fact that a ''

HalUwell	PERSON	,
Wright	PERSON	, and
Hotten	PERSON	say the same thing ; but
Hotten	PERSON	limits this use of the word at the present time to
Gravesend	LOCATION	on the Thames .

		A '' peterboat '' is defined in the
Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	as a fishing-boat pointed alike at both ends ; also , a crate to float in the water and keep fish alive : said to be a '' local
U. S.	PERSON	usage . ''

		The
Webster International	ORGANIZATION	does better : '' A peterboat is a fishing-boat sharp at both ends . ''


Halliwell	PERSON	-LRB- Arch , and Prov .

		Notice that all these definitions put stress on the sharpness of the ends of the boat .

		Here then is the original of '' peter-out , '' to grow small or thin .

		Hotten -LRB- Slang Dictionary , 1865 -RRB- defines the verb , '' to peter , to run short or give out . ''


Bartlett	PERSON	-LRB- Dictionary of Americanisms , edit .

		1877 -RRB- says , '' To peter out , to exhaust , to run out . ''

		He quotes two examples , -- from the
Boston	LOCATION	Post ,
1876	DATE	, '' the mines were petered out , '' making the verb passive , or like is gone , is fallen - from the
N. Y. Tribune	PERSON	, '' the influence of the Hon. seems to have quite petered out . ''

		But I first heard '' peter-out '' nearly twenty years earlier , in
1858	DATE	, from a
New Hampshire	LOCATION	man .

		He had been on a farm , and later in a printing-office in
Dover	LOCATION	, a river city ; still later he was among the lumbermen of
Minnesota	LOCATION	.

		The word in his mind had no relation to mining .

		This fact , and
Hotten	ORGANIZATION	's definition in
1865	DATE	, prove that the
Standard Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	certainly errs in defining the word as primarily a mining term .

		It says : '' In mining , to thin out , become exhausted : said of a vein or seam : and used with out : colloquially extended to anything that fails , or loses its power , efficiency , or value . ''

		On the contrary , the phrase was extended to mining from its wider sense .

		The definition in the
Webster International	ORGANIZATION	is correct , but is plainly made up from
Bartlett	LOCATION	; and it is erroneously marked '' Slang , U. S. '' But I have shown that it is English in origin .

		Aspeterboat preceded peter out , I am warranted in deriv - ing the verb from the tapering shape of the boat , thin and sharp .

		There are two other verbs that I should notice : -LRB- 1 -RRB- peter , to act the

		A WOMAi ^ ^ IN Unknown Ijabradok .

		* Few books of exploration have commanded so wide an interest , on the part of such varied classes of readers , as Mr.
Dillon Wallace	PERSON	's '' The Lure of the Labrador Wild '' and '' The Long Labrador Trail . ''

		In the formiir , Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	told of the unsuccessful attempt , in
1903	DATE	, of
Leonidas Hubbard , Jr.	PERSON	, himself and an Indian guide named
George Elson	PERSON	, to traverse the interior of Labrador northward .

		Starvation was
Hubbard	PERSON	's fate ;
Wallace	PERSON	narrowly escaped the same death after struggling heroically to save his leader and comrade ; the Indian guide , with centuries of endurance as his heritage , suc - ceeded in reaching a settlement and sending aid -- in time for
Wallace	PERSON	, too late for
Hubbard	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the second book
Wallace	PERSON	related his success - ful attempt -LRB- two years later -RRB- , inspired by the example of his friend , to accomplish the task that
Hubbard	PERSON	had undertaken .

		It would be curious to appraise at their true value the elements of these narratives which have led to their wide circulation .

		In point of scientific value , neither can be compared with scores of travel books -- notably , recent vol - umes of Arctic exploration .

		Probably the true reasons for the far-spread interest they awak - ened were , first , their appeal to the average , active , out-of-doors sort of man as the narrative of an adventure within the range of his own foresight , fortitude , and strength ; and , second , the tense dramatic style of the narrator , and the intimate , elemental and deeply tragic events of the first book , and to a lesser degree of the second .

		Now , Mrs.
Leonidas Hubbard	PERSON	, Jr. , gives us the narrative of her own successful effort to complete her husband 's unfinished work in order that his name '' should reap the fruits of service which had cost him so much . ''

		To the story of her journey she appends the diary of her hus - band from the outset of his trip to the time he fell asleep forever , and the narrative of
George Elson	PERSON	, his guide , covering his own experiences on that first fatal trip .

		The book is very fully illustrated ; there are excellent portraits of Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	and her husband , and a map which enables the reader to follow every weary portage , every night 's camp , and almost every dip of • A Woman 's Way through Unknown Labrador .

Groswater Bay	LOCATION	,
June 27 , 1905	DATE	-LRB- not
July 27	DATE	, as an inex - cusable typographical error on page 24 would have us believe -RRB- .

		Her companions were four in number --
Elson	PERSON	, who had been her husband 's guide ;
Joseph Iserhoff	PERSON	, a Russian half-breed ; Job Chapies , a pure-blood Cree Indian ; and
Gilbert Blake	PERSON	, a half-breed Eskimo boy trap - per , -- the last , unlike the others , a resident of Labrador .

		Her outfit included two canvas - covered canoes , nineteen feet long , thirteen inches deep , and thirty-four inches wide , and with each of them three paddles and a sponge .

		The remainder of the outfit consisted of two balloon-silk tents , one stove , seven water-proof canvas bags , one dozen ten - pound waterproof balloon-silk bags , three tarpaulins , 392 pounds of flour , four pounds of baking powder , fifteen pounds of rice , twenty cans of standard emer - gency rations , twelve pounds of tea , twelve pounds of chocolate , sixty pounds of sugar , twenty pounds of erbswurst , one ounce of crys - talose , four cans of condensed milk , four cans of condensed soup , four pounds of hard-tack , two hundred pounds of bacon , fourteen pounds of salt .

		She had also kitchen utensils , three small axes , one crooked knife , and two nets .

		The firearms were two rifles -- a 45-70 with sixty rounds of ammunition , and a 38 -- 55 with a hun - dred rounds .

		Each of the men had a 22 calibre single-shot pistol for small game , a pair of light wool camp-blankets , and an extra pair of '' shoe - packs . ''

		Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	was , of course - provided with a revolver , fishing-tackle , kodaks , films , a sextant , and an artificial horizon .

		With naive femininity she says : '' I wore a short skirt over knickerbockers , a short sweater , and a belt ... My hat was a rather narrow brimmed soft felt .

		I had one pair of heavy leather moc - casins reaching almost to my knees , one pair of high sealskin boots , one pair low ones , and three pairs of duffel .

		Of underwear I had four suits and five pairs of stockings , all wool .

		I took also a rubber automobile shirt , a long Swedish dog-skin coat , one pair leather gloves , one pair woolen gloves , and a blouse -- for

		For my tent , I had an air mattress , crib-size , one pair light camp blankets , one light wool comfortable weighmg 3i lbs. , one little feather pillow , and a hot - water bottle . ''

		From Grand Lake Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	passed into the
Nascaupee River	LOCATION	without difficulty , but not without thoughts of the dreadful error which had led her husband 's party to pass by its out - let and enter the fatal
Susan River	PERSON	, five miles beyond .

		By canoe and portage she followed the
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 northwesterly course of the
Nascaupee	LOCATION	, leaving it only for the long portage to Seal Lake , which she reached in three weeks , the distance covered being a hundred and fifteen miles .

		From Seal Lake the
Nascaupee River	LOCATION	carried her westerly to
Lake Michikamau	LOCATION	--
Lake Michikamau	LOCATION	, which her husband had been destined to see , but never to reach , ere he turned discouraged backward for the desperate struggle to reach the coast before
winter	DATE	.

		Through Michikamau her route was northward again to
Lake Michi	LOCATION	- kamats , and thence by a chain of small lakes to the very source of the
Nascaupee	PERSON	and the
George River	LOCATION	, the height of land from which she would thenceforth travel downward instead of upward , though northward still , her hopes and fears now centred on reaching
Ungava Bay	LOCATION	.

		She had now travelled three hundred miles .

		Her journey had been one of compelling interest ; she had found Labrador beautiful , '' with a strange , wild beauty , the remembrance of which buries itself silently in the deep parts of one 's being . ''

		In the beginning , she says , there had been no response to it in her heart ; but gradually , in its silent way , it had won , '' and now was like the strength-giving presence of an understand - ing friend . ''

		She had not experienced hardship .

		Weariness and discomfort she had met with de - termined good-humor and optimism .

		The northward descent , the second half of the journey , was made on the
George River	PERSON	, and the descriptions of its rapids are among the best in the book .

		Near one of the lakes of the upper George , Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	had the good for - tune to witness the migration of the caribou , which she thus describes : '' We pushed on , keeping close to the west shore of the lake .

		Little more than a mile further up , the men caught sight of deer feeding not far from the water 's edge .

		We landed , and climbing to the top of the rock wall saw a herd of fifteen or more feeding in the swamp .

		I watched them almost breathless .

		They were very beautiful , and it was an altogether new and delightful experience to me .

		Soon they saw us , and trotted off into the bush , though without sign of any great alarm !

		Greorge and Job made off across the swamp to investigate , and not long after returned , their eyes blazing with excite - ment , to say that there were hundreds of them not far away .

		Slipping hurriedly back into the canoes , we paddled rapidly and silently to near the edge of the swamp .

		Beyond it was a barren hill , which from near its foot sloped more gradually to the water .

		Along this bank , where this lower slope dropped to the swamp , lay a number of stags , with antlers so immense that I won - dered how they could possibly carry them .

		Beyond , the lower slope of the hill seemed to be a solid mass of caribou , while its steeper part was dotted over with many feeding on the luxuriant moss . ''

		Those lying along the bank got up at sight of us , and withdrew toward the great herd in rather leisurely manner , stopping now and then to watch us curiously .

		When the herd was reached , and the alarm given , the stags lined themselves up in the front rank and stood facing us , with heads high , and a rather defiant air .

		It was a magnificent sight .

		They were in
summer	DATE	garb of pretty brown , shading to light grey and white on the under parts .

		The horns were in velvet , and those of the stags seemed as if they must surely weigh down the heads on which they rested .

		It was a mixed company , for male and female were already herding together .

		I started toward the herd , kodak in hand , accompanied by
George	ORGANIZATION	, while the others remained at the shore .

		The splendid creatures seemed to grow taller as we ap - proached , and when we were within two hundred and fifty yards of them their defiance took definite form , and with determined step they came toward us . ''

		The sight of that advancing army under such leader - ship was decidedly impressive , recalling vivid mental pictures made by tales of the stampeding wild cattle in the west .

		It made one feel like getting back to the canoe and that is what we did ... We and the caribou stood watching each other for some time !

		Then the caribou began to rim from either extreme of the herd , some round the south end of the hill , and the others away to the north , the line of stags still maintaining their position .

		... A short paddle carried us round the point ... and there we saw them swimming across the lake .

		Three quarters of a mile out was an island , a barren ridge , standing out of the water , and from mainland to island they formed as they swam an unbroken bridge ; from the farther end of which they poured in steady stream over the hill-top , their flying forms clearly out - lined against the sky .

		How long we watched them I could not say , for I was too excited to take any note of time ; but finally the main body had passed .

		Yet when we landed above the point from which they had crossed , companies of them , eight , ten , fifteen , twenty in a herd , were to be seen in all directions ... The country was literally alive with the beautiful creatures and they did not seem to be much frightened .

		They apparently wanted only to keep what seemed to them a safe distance between us , and woidd stop to watch us curiously within easy rifle shot .

		Yet I am glad that I can record that not a shot was fired at them .

		Gilbert was wild , for he had in him the hunter 's instinct in fullest measure .

		The trigger of Job 's rifle clicked longingly , but they never forgot that starvation broods over
Labrador	LOCATION	, and that the animal they longed to shoot might some time save the life of one in just such extremity as that reached by Mr.
Hubbard	PERSON	and his party two years before ... For fifty miles of our journey beyond this point we saw com - panies of caribou every day , and sometimes many times a day , though we did not again see them in such numbers .

		The country was a net-work of their trails , in the wood - lands and bogs cut deep into the soft soil , on the barren hillsides , broad dark bands converging to the crossing place at the river . ''

		The caribou seem to have been on their way to the highlands between the
George River	LOCATION	and the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	believes herself the first person to have witnessed the migration of the great herd , save the Indians , who slaughter the caribou in great numbers during this period .

		It was the expectation of the party to find the Nascaupee Indians and secure from them some information as to the character of the George 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, River whose waters they must now traverse to their journey 's end .

		The guides were appre - hensive .

		`` Turning to me , George remarked , * You are giving that revolver a fine rubbing up to-night . ' '' '

		Yes , ' I replied , laughing a little , ' I am getting ready for the Nascaupees . ' '' '

		They would not shoot you , ' he said gravely . '

		It woidd be us they would kill if they took the notion .

		Whatever their conjuror tells them to do , they will do . ' '' '

		No , ' asserted
Gilbert	PERSON	, ' they would not kill you , Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	.

		It would be to keep you at their camp that they would kill us . ' ''

		I had been laughing at George a little , but
Gilbert	PERSON	's startling announcement induced a sudden sobriety .

		As I glanced from one to the other , the faces of the men were all unwontedly serious .

		There was a whirl of thoughts for a moment , and then I asked , ' What do you think I shall be doing while they ai-e killing you ?

		You do not need to think that because I will not kill rabbits , or ptarmigan , or caribou , I should have any objection to kiUing a Nascaupee Indian if it were neces - sary . '

		Nevertheless , the meetmg with the Indians had for me assumed a new and more serious aspect , and , remembering their agony of fear lest some harm befall me ere we reached civilization again , I reaUzed how the situation seemed to the men .

		When I went to my tent it was to lie very wide awake , turning over in my mind plans of battle in case the red men proved aggressive . ''

		The meeting with the
Nascaupee Indians	ORGANIZATION	proved , however , to be one of the most agree - able incidents of the trip .

		The first inquiry of the Indians was for tobacco , and then hands were extended in greeting .

		In broken English , but with expressive gestures , the Indians in - formed them of the distance and course yet to be travelled .

		An arm held at an angle showed the rapids to be expected , and a vigorous drop of the hand indicated the faUs .

		Best of all was the assurance that if they travelled fast they would sleep but five times before reaching the post at
Ungava	LOCATION	.

		This meant that Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	would arrive in time to secure passage on the last steamer leaving before the long Labrador winter set in .

		The Indians were hospitable , but no gallantries were attempted except a very diplomatic and indirect effort on the part of one young brave to make an impression on the fair visitor . ''

		One of the yoimg men , handsomer than the others , and conscious of the fact , had been watching me through - out with evident interest .

		He was not only handsomer but his leggings were redder .

		As we walked up toward the camp he went a little ahead , and to one side .

		A little distance from where we landed was a row of bark canoes turned upside down .

		As we passed them he turned , and , to make sure that those red leggings should not fail of their mission , he put his foot up on one of the canoes , pretending , as I passed , to tie his moccasin , the while watching for the effect . ''

		From the
Nascaupee	PERSON	camp the
George River	LOCATION	was an almost continuous course of rapids .

		There were stretches , miles in length , when the slope of the river was a steep gradient , and Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	held her breath as the canoe shot down at toboggan speed .

		There was not only the slope down , but a distinct tilt from one side to the other of the river could be observed .

		Even when the water was smooth and apparently motionless -LRB- though actually tremendously swift -RRB- the slope downward was clearly marked . ''

		But more weird and uncanny than wildest cascade or rapid was the dark vision which opened out before us at the head of Slanting Lake .

		The picture in my memory still seems unreal and mysterious , but the actual one was as disturbing as an evil dream .

		Down , down , down the long slope before us stretched the lake and river , black as ink under leaden sky and shadowing hills .

		The lake , which was three-quarters of a mile wide , dipped not only with the course of the river but appeared to dip also from one side to the other .

		Not a ripple or touch of white could be scan anywhere .

		All seemed motionless as if an unseen hand had touched and stilled it .

		A death - like quiet reigned and as we glided smoothly down with the tide we could see all about us a soft , boiling motion at the surface of this black flood which gave the sense of treachery as well as mystery . ''

		The travelling day was a short one during this part of the trip ; the strain on the men was too intolerable to be borne for many hours .

		The nights were made hideous by the mosquitoes .

		The flies had nearly driven Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	to distraction at an earlier period of the journey .

		Even a heavy veil , of several thicknesses , was insufficient protection .

		And so they raced down to the bay and found they had arrived ahead of the ship whose depar - ture without them they had feared so strongly .

		Summing up , they found they had travelled 576 miles from post to post ; the trip occupied forty - three days of actual travelling , eighteen days in camp .

		They had started with 750 pounds of provisions , 392 of which was flour ; their surplus was 150 pounds , of which 105 pounds was flour .

		The results claimed by Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	for her journey are pioneer maps of the
Nascaupee	ORGANIZATION	and
George Rivers	PERSON	, that of the
Nascaupee	ORGANIZATION	showing Seal Lake and
Lake Michikamau	LOCATION	to be in the same drainage basin -- proof that the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	and
Nascaupee	PERSON	are not two distinct rivers , but one , the outlet of
Lake Michikamau	LOCATION	; some notes by the way on the topography , geology , flora and fauna of the country traversed .

		From her own experience Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	con - cludes that had the season in which her husband made the journey , one of unprecedented sever - ity , been the more normal one in which her own trip was made , he would have returned safe and triumphant , despite his failure to find the open waterway to
Lake Michikamau	LOCATION	.

		His outfit and
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 2S9 provisions , she believes , would have been ample under normal conditions ; but she reminds those who have criticized him for lack of foresight in planning his outfit , that he did not plan it him - self .

		Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	's story occupies about two hundred pages .

		The remaining hundred pages are made up of a partial transcript of her husband 's diary , and the narrative of
Elson	PERSON	, the guide , with reference to the first expedition .

		The
Hubbard	PERSON	diary is , for the most part , written in short phrases from which unnecessary words are omitted , -- notes , evidently , for the story he meant to write at the conclusion of his jour - ney , the story finally written by another hand .

		Here are his last written words : '' My tent is pitched in open tent style in front of a big rock .

		The rock reflects the fire , but now it is going out because of the rain .

		I think I shall let it go and close the tent , till the rain is over , thus keeping out rain and saving wood .

		Tonight or tomorrow perhaps the weather will improve so I can build a fire , eat the rest of my moccasins , and have some bone broth .

		Then I can boil my belt and oil tanned moccasins and a pair of cow-hide mittens .

		They ought to help some .

		I am not suffering .

		The acute pangs of hunger have given way to indifference .

		I am sleepy .

		I think death from starvation is not so bad .

		But let no one suppose that I expect it .

		I am prepared , that is all .

		I think the boys will be able , with the Lord 's help , to save me . ''

		The latter half of the diary is perhaps as vivid a description of human suffering as ever was given to the world to read .


Elson	PERSON	`` s diary contains an iinbelievable state - ment with regard to
Wallace	PERSON	-- that for the sake of recovering the much-used and probably broken-in canoe he would have had
Elson	PERSON	re - turn to the wilderness soon after
Hubbard	PERSON	's body had been recovered .

		Aside from this , the
Elson	PERSON	diary is most interesting , and in its own way supplements the earlier narratives .

		Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	has accomplished a hazardous undertaking , requiring such courage and endur - ance as only a woman of rare character would have possessed .

		Her book should command a wide circle of interested readers .

		It is to be regretted , however , that her account lacks both definiteness and good form in its presentation ; there are hopeless and involved anti-climaxes when striking situations afforded opportunities for quite the opposite effects .

		One reader , at least , has been pained by the evident deprecia - tion , throughout her book , of
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	's services to her husband and loyalty to his memory , as evidenced in the earlier books and by
Hubbard	ORGANIZATION	's own diary .

		Private differences , if there be such , should not have led Mrs.
Hubbard	PERSON	to set down aught in malice .

		By inference , she clearly gives all the credit for the heroic effort to save her husband 's life to
Elson	PERSON	; to him belongs the praise for heroism almost beyond belief .

		But it should be remembered that when , after finding the dis - carded flour , it was
Elson	PERSON	's duty to seek his way out of the wilderness ; he knew that every step he took , painful and desperate as his condition was , took him nearer to light and warmth and food and the friends he was to send back to the rescue .

		But
Wallace	PERSON	shouldered his sack of mouldy flour , bade farewell to
Elson	PERSON	, and turned his face resolutely back again toward the wilder - ness -- toward that tent in the very valley of the shadow of death ; back to find , if he could , the dying man to whom he carried food , there per - haps to die with him ere the rescuers came .

		He is not the less a hero that he failed , -- and he did not sink down in despair until he had gone the full distance back to the tent , and beyond it , missing it with his blinded eyes , still strug - gling with naked frozen feet through the snow to find his friend .

		They were all three heroic in their courage and devotion to each other , their patience and their hopefulness .

		But there were three heroes , not two , -- and the number of them should not be lessened as the tale is told .

Korea	LOCATION	. ''

		Of distinct merits , the book posses - ses not a few .

		For one thing , it is not unduly ambitious ; and for a book of its class that is saying a good deal .

		It makes no attempt to attack and despatch all things Oriental , past , present , and future .

		Its scope is definite and its treatment concise .

		If at first glance it appears a slight piece of work , it will be found a more satisfying book than the majority of its kind , and the jaded reader should be thankful for its lack of the customary journalistic '' dead mat - ter . ''

		In the second place , the book is the work of a man who has been long upon the ground and who writes entirely from observation or other first-hand sources of information .

		And in the third place , though obviously intended as an arraignment of
Japan	LOCATION	for her recent course • The Tragedy op
Korea	LOCATION	.

		290 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, in
Korea	LOCATION	, the volume comes from the pen of an Englishman who was until recently an ardent admirer of the Japanese , and who , reluctantly brought by events to a change of sentiment , is as fair-minded and conservative in his judgments as any writer upon so vexed a subject can well be .

		Approximately , the first third of the volume is taken up with a running sketch of the opening of
Korea	LOCATION	, from the ill-fated visit of the American schooner '' General Sherman '' in
1866	DATE	and the conclusion of the first Japanese-Korean treaty in
1876	DATE	to the outbreak of the recent
Russo	PERSON	- Japanese war .

		The Korean aspects of the
Chino	PERSON	- Japanese war and of the treaty of
Shimonoseki	LOCATION	, together with the striking events following the murder of the Korean queen in
1895	DATE	, are described in an unusually intelligible manner .

		Then follows a careful account of the period from
1895	DATE	to the Russo-Japanese war and the treaty of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		The inevitableness of the conflict is clearly brought out , together with the reasons why such a war was certain to be epochal in the history of the Korean peninsula .

		The body of the book , however , is devoted to the brief period since the Peace of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, and more particularly to the operations of the Japanese in the
Hermit Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	since that date .

		Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	has been in
Korea	LOCATION	con - tinuously during these years , and has had under his eye the methods and processes by which the influence of
Japan	LOCATION	has been made all-pervasive and all-powerful among the Korean people .

		In a succession of vivid chapters he sets forth a melancholy record of devastation , plunder , cruelty , and ruin , wrought by Japanese troops and officials throughout the peninsula in course of the work of `` pacification . ''

		Describing a horseback observation trip in the vicinity of I-Chhon , he writes as foUows : '' We rode on through village after village and ham - let after hamlet burned to the groimd .

		The very atti - tude of the people told me that the hand of
Japan	LOCATION	had struck hard there .

		We would come upon a boy carrying a load of wood .

		He would run quickly to the side of the road when he saw us , expecting he knew not what .

		We passed a village with a few houses left .

		The women flew to shelter as I drew near .

		Some of the stories that I heard later helped me to judge why they should run .

		Of course they took me for a Japanese .

		All along the route I heard tales of the Japanese plundering , where they had not destroyed .

		Here the village elders would bring me an old man badly beaten by a Japanese soldier because he resisted being robbed .

		Then came darker stories .

		In
Seoul	LOCATION	I had laughed at them .

		Now , face to face with the victims , I could laugh no more .

		That afternoon we rode into I-Chhon itself .

		This is quite a large town .

		I found it practically deserted .

		Most of the people had fled to the hills to escape the Japanese .

		I slept that night in a school-house , now deserted and unused .

		There were the cartoons and animal pictures and pious mottoes around , but the children were far away .

		I passed through the market-place , usually a very busy spot .

		There was no sign of life there .

		I turned to some of the
Koreans	LOCATION	.

		* Where are your women ?

		Where are your children ? '

		I demanded .

		They pointed to the high and barren hills looming against the distant heavens . '

		They are up there , ' they said . '

		Better for them to lie on the barren hill-sides than to be outraged here . ' ''

		And so the mournful story goes , chapter after chapter .

		Allowing as much as one may for possible over-drawing , it is still plain that we have here a record of bloodshed and ruin which challenges the attention of the civilized world .

		In a very interesting chapter on '' The
Suppres	PERSON	- sion of Foreign Criticism , '' the author considers the natural query as to why the Europeans and Americans resident in
Korea	LOCATION	did not make known the full facts about the Japanese administration at an earlier date . ''

		Some of them did attempt it , '' he asserts , '' but the strong feeling that generally existed abroad in favor of the Japanese people -- a feeling due to the magnificent con - duct of the nation during the war -- caused com - plaints to go unheeded . ''

		And he declares that scores like himself , alienated by the mistakes and follies of
Russia	LOCATION	's Far Eastern policies and favorably impressed by the qualities of the Japanese which caught the fancy of the whole world , looked on for a long time in silence , unwilling to believe anything but the best of the sturdy antagonists of the Muscovite .

		Per - haps the most interesting portion of the whole book is the account of the journalistic rivalries of the pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese parties in
Seoul	LOCATION	, with particular reference to the work of Mr.
Bethell	PERSON	, the editor of the ''
Korea	LOCATION	Daily News . ''

		Although high officials at Tokio , such as
Viscount Teranchi	PERSON	, Minister of War and
Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, are insistently pro- claiming that
Japan	LOCATION	's programme is not one of empire , of conquest , and of war , Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	refuses to be convinced .

		In his concluding chapter he contends that the policy of
Japan	LOCATION	in
Korea	LOCATION	to-day '' can not be fully understood unless it is regarded , not as an isolated manifestation , but as a part of a great Imperial scheme . '


Japan	LOCATION	, he asserts , has set out to be a great world-power , and she is rapidly realizing her ambition .

		Else - where he declares : `` I , for one , am convinced that we owe it to ourselves and to our ally ,
Japan	LOCATION	, to let it be clearly known that a policy of Imperial expansion based upon breaches of solemn treaty obligations to a weaker nation , and built up by odious cruelty , by needless slaughter , and by a wholesale theft of the private property rights of a

		THE DIAL .

		29X dependent and defenceless peasantry , is repugnant to our instincts and can not fail to rob the nation that is doing it of much of that respect and goodwill with which we all so recently regarded her . ''

		Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	confesses to a very profound respect for the capacities of the Japanese people , but it is his belief that in her striving to become a world-power the nation is at present over-reach - ing herself .

		Indeed , he is generous enough to attribute the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's obnoxious Korean policies to the grinding economic conditions prevailing since the war . ''


Japan	LOCATION	, '' he says , '' has broken her solemn promises to
Korea	LOCATION	, and has evaded in every way her pledged obligations to maintain the policy of equal opportunities , because she is driven thereto by heavy taxation , by the poverty of her people , and by the necessity of obtaining fresh markets and new lands for settlement . ''

		But that these are the impelling forces rather than mere rampant imperialism , does not help matters for
Korea	LOCATION	.

		Her lot Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	regards as palpably unhappy , and as likely to continue so unless Japanese energies shall be turned in other directions .

		Obviously , there is a good deal that might be said -- a good deal that has been said -- on the other side .

		But the statements of fact and the assertions of opinion which Mr.
McKenzie	PERSON	has set down in his little book are abundantly worth giving to the world .

		There is an appendix containing a number of the essential documents , and there are numer - ous excellent illustrations , which are also the authors handiwork .

		But , unfortunately , there is no index .


Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	.

		Canadians of IjOng Ago .

		* In the very readable volume entitled ''
Cana	LOCATION	- dian Types of the Old Regime , '' Professor
Colby	PERSON	does not profess to have brought forward any strikingly new material .

		His aim is , rather , to approach the life of Old
Canada	LOCATION	by an untried route ; to present certain phases of that life in a manner that , as he has applied it , is both novel and effective .

		To secure distinctness , in discuss - ing various aspects of French colonization in the
New World	LOCATION	, '' the examples have been drawn , chapter by chapter , from some one career .

		Or , rather , a single personage has been made the representative of a class , and in considering the large subject with which he is connected , certain features of his experience are rendered promin - ent .

		But , '' the author adds , '' this method does • Canadian Types op the Old Regime , 1608-1698 .

		not involve the exact portraiture of individuals , nor does it exclude minor figures from the field of the discussion . ''

		The subject is opened by an admirable intro - ductory chapter on '' The Historical Background of
New France	LOCATION	. ''

		Professor
Colby	PERSON	points out the strong influence of the Renaissance , and of the Reformation , upon the colonization of
New France	LOCATION	; and sketches briefly and skilfully the relations of the king , the nobles , the great min - isters Richelieu ,
Mazarin	PERSON	, and
Colbert	PERSON	, and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, respectively , to the colony , as well as the effect which the neighboring colonies of
New England	LOCATION	had upon the development of
New France	LOCATION	.

		In succeeding chapters , he takes up the several colonial types one by one .

		Champ - lain is taken as the type of the Explorer , but not entirely to the exclusion of the other famous pathfinders of
Old Canada	LOCATION	, such as La Salle ,
Marquette	LOCATION	,
Joliet	LOCATION	, and
Nicolet	ORGANIZATION	.

		Similarly ,
Bre	ORGANIZATION	- beuf is taken as type of the
Missionary	ORGANIZATION	, the personalities of other Jesuit martyrs being grouped around that heroic figure of
New France	LOCATION	.

		Opportunity is found for a discus - sion of the attitude of the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	and the Calvinists toward missions , and the rela - tions of the several orders , Jesuits , Recollets , and Sulpicians , toward
New France	LOCATION	and each other .

		With
Louis Hebert	PERSON	as his type of the Col - onist , Professor Colby sketches effectively the commercial life of
Canada	LOCATION	under the Old Regime , the fur-trade ,
Richelieu	PERSON	and the Com - pany of the
Hundred Associates	ORGANIZATION	, the exclusion of the Huguenots , the seigniorial system and its effect upon the habitant the coureur de bois ^ etc. .

		With D'lberville as a central point , the Soldier type of
New France	LOCATION	is presented .

		We are reminded not only of the romantic exploits of D'lberville himself in
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	and else - where -- exploits as dramatic and fascinating as anything in fiction -- but of many other incidents of pluck and heroism , the story of
DoUard	ORGANIZATION	's matchless self-sacrifice at the
Long Sault	LOCATION	, the adventures of Fran9ois
Hertel	PERSON	,
Maisonneuve	PERSON	and the Iroquois ,
Frontenac	ORGANIZATION	's raids against the British colonies , etc. .

		Du Lhut , as type of the coureui ' de bois ^ introduces us to one of the most fascinating phases of the life of
New France	LOCATION	-- the fur - trader , with his curious blending of commerce and romance .

		Du
Lhut	PERSON	's own adventures , his relations with
La Salle	PERSON	, his rescue of Hennepin -LRB- most mendacious of historians -RRB- from the
Sioux	LOCATION	, are sufficiently interesting ; but they pale before the exploits of that matchless adventurer

		Of the remaining chapters ,
Laval	ORGANIZATION	furnishes a type for the Bishop ; and the Governor is represented by
Frontenac	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the final chapter , the author brings together a great deal of interesting material bearing on the position of Women in
New France	LOCATION	, contrasting the women of
France	LOCATION	and of
Canada	LOCATION	in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, and quoting the entertaining account of the Swedish traveller ,
Peter Kalm	PERSON	.

		For the rest , we have striking word-pictures of some of the more famous women of
New France	LOCATION	-- the heroine
Madeleine de Vercheres	PERSON	, the Duchesse d'Aiguillon and the hospital at
Quebec	LOCATION	,
Madame de la Peltrie	ORGANIZATION	and the
Ursulines	LOCATION	,
Marie	PERSON	de I ` lncarnation ,
Jeanne Mance	PERSON	and the hospital at
Montreal	LOCATION	,
Marguerite Bourgeoys	PERSON	and the Nuns of the
Congregation	ORGANIZATION	.

		All this is both informing and entertaining . ''

		History , '' says Professor
Colby	PERSON	, '' does not exist simply for the benefit of the erudite , and there are always some to whom a book is recom - mended by the absence of specific gravity . ''

		No one could call this book heavy , and yet even the erudite might find much in it that would repay perusal .

		Its foundation , it may be added , is a course of lectures originally delivered by Pro- fessor
Colby	ORGANIZATION	before the
May Court Club	ORGANIZATION	at
Ottawa	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	.


Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	.

		The Spanish Inquisition in History .

		* The last few years have witnessed a remark - able activity in the field of American histor - iography .

		Scholars who but recently were engaged in monographic investigations appear to have developed a sudden desire to work in broader fields , to present results already ob - tained rather than give all their energies to the examination of difficult and disputed problems .

		As a consequence , the historical side of Amer - ican literature is developing as never before .

		Abroad , however , if we may judge from the scanty notices that some of our best recent productions have received in literary journals , little attention is being paid to this develop - ment .

		Except in a general way , the European student is not interested in American history ; and as most of our historical writers are study - ing the annals of our own country their work does not appeal , as it might , to foreign scholars .

		It is the subject-matter , and not deficiencies in * A History of the Inquisition op
Spain	LOCATION	.

Henry Charles Lea	PERSON	.

		quality , that prevents the American historian from receiving merited recognition abroad .

		Still , there is at least one American writer of history whose fame is great in
Europe	LOCATION	-- greater , perhaps , than in his own country .

		Forty years ago a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	business man began to publish a series of studies in mediaeval society which placed him at once in the front rank of historical investigators .

		His first book was a collection of essays on the judicial pro- cedure of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, to which he gave the general title '' Superstition and
Force	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Since then .

		Dr.
Lea	PERSON	has continued to explore the mysterious borderlands of mediaeval eccle - siastical and social history , and has written learnedly on such themes as Clerical Celibacy ,
Excommimication	LOCATION	, the Mediaeval Inquisition ,
Auricular Confession	ORGANIZATION	, the Expulsion of the
Moors	ORGANIZATION	, and kindred subjects .

		In
1888	DATE	ap - peared his three - volume '' History of the
Inquisi	PERSON	- tion of the Middle Ages , '' which a distinguished English historical student .

		Lord
Acton	PERSON	, called the greatest contribution of the
New World	LOCATION	to the history of the Old World .

		At the same time it was announced that the author was col - lecting materials for a study of the later form of the Inquisition , that which originated in
Spain	LOCATION	in the reign of Ferdinand and
Isabella	LOCATION	.

		This work has recently appeared , as planned , in four volumes of about six hundred pages each .

		To these the author has added a supplementary volume , in which he traces the history of the Inquisition in the Spanish dependencies .

		Dr.
Lea	PERSON	has grouped his materials under nine heads , the discussion of each making a book .

		These are , the Origin , Relations with the
State	ORGANIZATION	, Jurisdiction ,
Organization	ORGANIZATION	, Resources , Practice , Punishments , Spheres of Action , and the final fate of the institution -LRB- the conclusion -RRB- .

		In the supplementary volume the grouping is naturally of a geographical rather than of a topical char - acter , a chapter being devoted to the Inquisition in each of the principal dependencies or each group of dependencies .

		The author does not attempt to discuss the Inquisition in the
Spanish Netherlands	LOCATION	, as the necessary documents -LRB- now being collected by Professor Paid Fredericq -RRB- are not yet accessible .

		In the popular mind the
Inquisition	ORGANIZATION	is nearly always associated with the efforts to crush out the Protestant heresies of the sixteenth century .

		It is true that in many European countries , notably in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, this tribunal in its modem form was vigorously employed for such a purpose ; but with its origin Protestantism had nothing to do .

		The Spanish Inquisition
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 had done great and effective work before the German reformer raised his voice against the abuses that he thought he had found in the Church .

		That we may understand why this terrible institution was called into being , the author discusses at some length the political and racial situation on the Spanish peninsula at the close of the middle ages .

		He finds that before the dawn of the modem era the Spaniards were the most tolerant people in
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		The Jews and the Moors who lived among and about them were treated with a kindness that amounted to favor .

		But by the close of the fourteenth cen - tury , this most tolerant nation had become the most intolerant of all .

		The common statement that the hatred then displayed was an inborn pecidiarity of the Spanish race does not satisfy Dr.
Lea	PERSON	. ''

		Such facts , '' he tells us , '' must have their explanations , and it is the business of the expositor of history to trace them to their causes . ''

		The larger part of Book I. , more than two hundred pages , is devoted to a study of this change in the Castilian character and its effect on the non-Christian popidation .

		The change is attributed mainly to the constant pressure of the Church ; and in support of this conclusion the author quotes freely from the anti-Jewish legislation of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	councils and the repressive secular ordinances that grew out of the demands of the Church . ''

		The
Church	ORGANIZATION	, in its efforts to arouse the popiJar hatred , was powerfully aided by the odium which the Jews themselves excited through their ostentation , their usury , and their functions as public offi - cials . ''

		This hatred soon showed itself in per - secution and bloodshed , especially in the mas - sacres of
1391	DATE	, the history of which is told in detail by Dr.
Lea	PERSON	.

		This changed attitude of their neighbors struck terror into the hearts of the Jewish people , and multitudes of that race sought re - fuge in baptism .

		But the Catholic priest soon discovered that in many cases the conversion was merely a superficial change ; and he trem - bled at the thought that a large , wealthy , and influential section of his church was infected with heresy , which to the mediaeval mind was the greatest of all crimes , the vilest of all sins .

		It was to remove this new danger to the faith that the Spanish Inquisition was established .

		The statement of the historian Motley that '' it was originally devised for Jews and Moors , '' and was afterwards '' extended from pagans to heretics , '' is clearly an error .

		Dr.
Lea	PERSON	shows conclusively that the non-Christians were en - tirely beyond the jurisdiction of any ecclesias - tical tribunal ; until they became converts the Inquisition could not reach them .

		He also rejects the recent belief that the Inquisition was '' a political engine for the conversion of
Spain	LOCATION	from a mediaeval feudal monarchy to one of the modern absolute type . ''

		This change was effected by other means , especially by the employment of the
Santa Hermandad	LOCATION	^ or
Holy Brotherhood	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is true , however , that the tribunal at times gave valuable aid to the cause of absolute monarchy , particularly in the colonies , where it was found extremely con - venient to treat insurrectionary teachings as heresies .

		The author is careful to bring out the differ - ence between the earlier Inquisition and the new Spanish tribunal .

		The fact that the latter had its own organization , framed its own rules , could call aU the forces of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to its assistance , and was subject to no power but the sovereign , gave it tremendous opportunities for aggrandize - ment , especially when the throne was occcupied by a weak monarch . ''

		At times it was the instrument of his will ; at others it seemed as though it might almost supplant the monarchy ; it was constantly seeking to extend its awful authority over the other departments of state , which struggled with varying success to resist its encroachments , while successive kings , auto - cratic in theory , sometimes posed as arbitrators , sometimes vainly endeavored to enforce their pacificatory commands , but more generally yielded to its domineering spirit . ''

		That a tribunal composed of practically irre - sponsible judges woidd often exercise its power in a tyranical manner , is to be expected ; and the author finds that such was too often the case .

		A notable instance is the case of Arch - bishop
Carranza	PERSON	, which occupied the attention of
Christendom	LOCATION	for seventeen years , and of which the author gives a detailed account .

		In this case are illustrated not only the vindictive and persecuting spirit of the inquisitorial au - thorities , but also their cupidity , their jealousy of papal control , and their willingness to serve the Spanish monarch .

		The charge of cruelty is considered in the sixth and seventh books , which are devoted to practice and punishments .

		Dr.
Lea	PERSON	finds that the tribunals of the
Holy Office	ORGANIZATION	often did carry the use of torture to a terrible extreme ; but his general conclusion is that '' the popular impression that the inquisi - torial torture-chamber was the scene of excep - tional refinement in cruelty , of persistence in extorting confessions , is an error due to sensa - tional writers who have exploited credulity . ''

		294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, The Spanish Inquisition , in the application of torture , was less cruel , we are told , than the secular courts or the Roman Inquisition .

		But this does not mean that the inquisitorial pro- cedure was considerate or mild ; the tribimal was determined to gain its ends , and where the usual means failed -LRB- which they did but rarely -RRB- the inquisitors had no scruples about the use of torture .

		Still , so long as the Inquisition busied itself with matters of faith and heresy , the people endured without much complaining .

		And yet .

		Dr.
Lea	PERSON	concludes that the
Holy Office	ORGANIZATION	came to be hated and detested '' by all classes , -- laymen and ecclesiastics , noble and simple . ''

		This hostility resulted from the attempts of the inquisitors to interfere in purely secular matters ; especially did the people resent their efforts to establish commercial monopolies .

		In a most instructive chapter on the Privileges of the
Holy Office	ORGANIZATION	, the author shows how this institution , because of its exemption from taxes , tariff dues , and the like , was able to comer markets and crush competitors almost as effectively as a modern trust .

		Such perversion of spiritual authority to secular and often unholy uses appears to have become quite common and frequent .

		As to the effects of inquisitorial activity on national life and progress , the author speaks in terms of unqualified condemnation .

		`` It is impossible not to conclude that the Inquisition paralyzed both the intellectual and the economic development of
Spain	LOCATION	... Material progress became impossible , industry languished , and the inability to meet foreign competition assisted the mistaken internal policy of the government in prolonging and intensifying the poverty of the people . ''

		At the same time he acquits the author - ities of intentional guilt in the following striking sentences : `` Yet who can blame Isabella and
Torquemada	ORGANIZATION	or the Hapsburg princes for their share in originating and maintaining this disastrous instrument of wrong ?

		The Church had taught for centuries that implicit acceptance of its dogmas and blind obedience to its commands were the only avenues to salvation ; that heresy was treason to God , its extermination the highest service to God and the highest duty to man .

		This grew to be the universal belief , and , when Protestant sects framed their several confessions , each one was so supremely confident of pos - sessing the secret of the Divine Being and his dealings with his creatures that all shared the zeal to serve God in the same cruel fashion . ''

		Dr.
Lea	PERSON	's latest history has all the virtues of his earlier studies : it is written in clear un - adorned English ; the discussion is temperate , calm , and judicial ; every statement is fortified with documentary proofs ; and the more import - ant matters are treated with careful presentation of details .

		At the venerable age of four score and three years , the author is apparently as strong and keen and vigorous as ever ; and this , his latest work , ranks easily with his strongest and best .

		Recent Fiction .

		* A story opening which never fails of its appeal is that which pictures a boy born to poverty but hav - ing within him the capacity to lift himself above his native surroundings and achieve success by his own unaided efforts .

		No one can fail to follow sympa - thetically the steps in such a career -- particularly the early steps -- as the boyish soul gradually awakens to its predestined heritage and as the years of dawning manhood bring the first flush of success to the toilsome life .

		It is such a boy that Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	brings to our attention in the opening pages of ''
Lewis Rand	PERSON	, '' and her book bears the name of her hero .

		The scene is
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the period is that of the very beginning of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Republic , when people still have fresh memories of
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	and
Yorktown	PERSON	, and when `` The Federalist '' offers a more controversial subject than the sacred scriptures .

		The boy , ignorant and ragged , is befriended by no less a personage than Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	, then newly entered upon his duties as
Washington	LOCATION	's
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The real action of the story begins a dozen or more years later , when
Lewis	PERSON	has become a successful lawyer and Re - publican politician , and his patron , firmly seated in the Presidential chair , has shown himself no mere doctrinaire by the act of statesmanship which with a stroke of the pen doubled the area of the

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 every tie of gratitude should have kept him bound , and plots secret treason against his country .

		The bursting of the bubble saves him from the commis - sion of the overt act , and
Jefferson	PERSON	, who has held in his hands the threads of the conspiracy all the time , is magnanimous enough to spare the ingrate from public exposure .

		But a proud and rebellious nature of
Lewis Rand	PERSON	's type is bound to work its own de - struction in some way , and the man who has just escaped being a traitor in the open becomes a mur - derer in private in a moment of uncontrollable pas - sion .

		His conscience , and the urgency of his high - minded wife , finally compel him to make confession , and the story closes when he gives himself up to justice .

		Although the curtain then falls , there can be but one possible sequel , for the murder was most wanton , and the victim a very noble gentleman .

		This sombre outcome is not what we are led to anti- cipate in the earlier chapters , and it is something of a shock to learn that the admiration due to a Lucifer is all that we are permitted for our hero in the end .

		Byron 's '' Manfred '' supplies the words which ex - actly fit him . ''

		This should have been a noble creature ; he Hath all the energy which would have made A goodly frame of glorious elements , Had they been wisely mingled ; as it is It is an awful chaos -- light and darkness , And mind and dust , and passions and pure thoughts Mixed , and contending without end or order . ''

		But the story is a strong one , richly furnished forth with the accessories of historical fact and of the manners of Virginians a century ago .

		It pro- vides a vivid presentation of a deeply interesting period in our national annals , and it throbs with a very real life , albeit a life romantically tinged .

		Miss
Johnston	PERSON	is to be warmly congratulated , for ''
Lewis	PERSON	Rand '' is a better book than she has here - tofore written .

		It is not often that we come upon a novel written with the conscious artistic purpose of Mr.
Lewisohn	PERSON	's `` The Broken Snare , '' in which the imperative demands of technique -- both verbal and architectonic -- are never ignored , and which yet has no lack of rich human substance .

		The author has taken
Flaubert	PERSON	for his model , and has shown himself a not unworthy disciple of the master .

		More than most works of fiction , this is the story of a man and a woman , to the exclusion of all other personalities ; of their love and its consequences , to the exclusion of all other interests .

		The woman is an ardent creature , cramped by the conditions of a peculiarly mean and sordid existence ; the man has the artist 's temperament , and what he imagines to be deep convictions concerning the futility of the marriage-bond .

		The two agree to join their lives without the usual legal proceedings , and set out for a honeymoon in the South .

		For a short time all is idyllic with them , and then the inevitable break comes , to which we are led through the gradual stages of sub-concious unrest , growing irritation , jarring mutual revelations of character , and the clash of fundamentally opposed ideals .

		Then there is separation , and a long term of suffering for both ; finally , the sex-duel sees the woman the victor , the man 's intellectual pride is abased , and they are reunited upon the terms that have been decreed by the wisdom of the ages as the only possible foundation for the family and for human society .

		It will thus be seen that the book , despite its boldness of speech and conception , is ethically wholesome .

		It does not seek by means of false sentiment to incline us to the acceptance of evil , and its moral emphasis is not misplaced .

		It is not a book for the young person to read , but it is one from which the mature mind can get nothing but good , and one which offers a singular satisfac - tion to the artistic perceptions .

		At discreet intervals , Mr.
Herman Knickerbocker Viel	PERSON	^ projects a new romantic invention into the sphere of publicity , and thereby occasions much joy to the knowing .

		There have been three of these projections heretofore , and the fourth is now at hand , alluringly entitled `` Heartbreak Hill . ''

		The HiU is described by the heroine as '' an incorrigible amorphic orphan , abandoned to the mercies of a self-satisfied Upper SUurian family , '' which means that it lifts its shaggy form above the surroimding flatness of field and meadow , and tries to make up in picturesqueness what it lacks in utility .

		It is the joint property of two cousins -- a boy and a girl -- having come into the family through an ancestral dicker with the Indians .

		That the pioneer who bought it for a jug of rum had a long head becomes apparent as the story progresses , because numerous persons make efforts to secure its ownership with - out disclosing any apparently adequate motives .

		The secret of the matter is that the Hill hides a rich vein of copper which is destined to enrich the cousins when they have thwarted various efforts on the part of outsiders to come into possession .

		By a singular coincidence , these young people also join their fortunes in another and more intimate relation .

		This is pleasant , because they are nice young people , and quite deserving of each other .

		Such is the substance of a story which is written in the vein of light-hearted comedy for which Mr.
Viel	PERSON	^ has prepared us by his earlier books , and which is a work of delicate art in its every detail .

		Sentiment and humor are nicely balanced in its pages , and the transcript of
New England	LOCATION	life and character is both truthful and charming .

		`` The Last Voyage of the
Donna Isabel	PERSON	'' is a brave tale of a young American hiding in Val - paraiso , who is tricked into stealing an English - man 's yacht , and finds himself in nominal command of a crew of pirates .

		They have lured him into this compromising position because they have need of his seamanship , but he is otherwise completely at their mercy .

		Their objective point is in the
Antarctic Ocean	LOCATION	, whence strange report has come of a treasure-ship -- a Spanish galleon -- held fast in the ice for a century and a half .

		Unwittingly , they have not only stolen the yacht but have also abducted the owner 's wife , whose presence on board was not 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, suspected .

		Thus a heroine is provided for our hero , for Lady
Darlington	LOCATION	is young and charming , and does not love her aged husband overmuch .

		However , the conventions are respected until the final discovery , after the yacht has returned from its perilous voyage , that its owner has been conven - iently assassinated in the meantime .

		As for the
Donna Isabel	PERSON	-- a Spanish ship despite its un - Spanish name -- that also is discovered , filled with gold and corpses , but the treasure goes to the bot - tom of the sea , together with most of the pirates .

		This is evidently the outline of a `` rattling '' story , and it must be reckoned among the most successful of Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	's inventions .

		`` The Castle of Dawn '' is the alluring title of Mr.
Harold Morton Kramer	PERSON	's tale of the
Ozarks	LOCATION	.

		The castle is a palatial mountain residence , no longer inhabited by the buUder whose tastes it embodies , but become the refuge of certain conspirators against the stability of a Spanish - American repub - lic .

		To this retreat a newspaper reporter from
Chicago	LOCATION	and the daughter of a purse-proud million - aire find their way , being , in fact , kidnapped by the conspirators , who mistakenly fancy these innocent young people the enemies of their patriotic cause .

		The period of captivity is long enough for propin - quity to do its deadly work , and the two , entire strangers to each other at first , develop after a few weeks into a pair of romantically interesting lovers .

		Of their exciting adventures and thrilling escape we will say naught in detail ; these particulars are eminently satisfying to the romantic mood .

		We may say a word in commendation of the crisp dia logue and humorous touch which are features of the author 's literary equipment .

		He has clothed an es - sentially imaginative story-skeleton in the garb of reality , and has just escaped the obvious danger of lapsing into melodrama .

		It is all very trifling , but it is also very diverting .

		`` Kitty Tailleur '' in
England	LOCATION	, `` The Immortal Moment '' in the
United States	LOCATION	-- these are the titles chosen , to the confusion of both librarians and readers , for Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	's latest novel .

		The reprehensible practice here indicated should never be allowed to go without a sharp word of censure .

		The story is of the flimsiest texture , and consists largely of frothy dialogue , which , however , does produce its effect in illuminating the characters of the two persons mainly concerned .

		These are the charming
Kitty	PERSON	and the simple-minded man whom she captivates .

		They meet in a seaside hotel , and it takes less than two weeks to bring them into re - lations which mean acute misery for the man and self-destruction for the woman .

		For
Kitty	PERSON	, who is nice , is also naughty , or at least has been naughty to a quite unpardonable degree .

		And when the man , to whom the very thought of such evil as her life has embodied is almost inconceivable , has the truth thrust in his face , tragedy ensues .

		For he has championed her against the gossippers , has be - lieved in her , and has asked her to be his wife .

		Her '' immortal moment '' is ironically so called , for it is the moment in which her higher nature asserts itself , and she makes the confession which she knows must end her dream .

		It is a delicate subject , but we must add that it is handled with delicacy .

		As a faint reflex of the Camille story this one must be set down as essentially immoral , simply because its intention is to throw a sentimental glamor over the ugly outlines of depravity .

		But we can not dis - pute its literary art or its emotional subtlety .

		We have not had a story of the
Civil Wars	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	for some time , and Mr.
H. C. Bailey	PERSON	's '' Colonel Greatheart '' is a particularly good one .

		The title is fanciful , as indicating the quality rather than the actual cognomen of his hero .

		One Colonel Stow , it seems , returning to
England	LOCATION	after service in the Thirty Years ' War , finds King and Par - liament at odds .

		Strife has begun , the court is at
Oxford	LOCATION	,
Rupert	ORGANIZATION	is the man of the hour on one side , while on the other the genius of one
Oliver Crom	PERSON	- well has not yet made itself manifest .

		Our hero is urged by the lady love of his youth to espouse the royalist cause , which he does , being a romantic idealist , although even then to the eye of a trained soldier that cause is foredoomed .

		The tale runs from
Marston Moor	ORGANIZATION	to
Naseby	LOCATION	, and our hero gives a good acccount of himself personally , although his side is steadily losing .

		But worse than the defeats of the royalist forces are his personal and moral de - feats , for he is doubly betrayed , by the woman whom he loves , and by his dearest companion-in-arms .

		Nevertheless , his honor is engaged , and he fights on in a cause which no longer means aught to him , and nearly loses his life in a desperate effort to save the
King	PERSON	from his own weakness .

		In the end , he for - sakes the field , and finds balm for his wounded af - fections in the love of a puritan maid .

		This is the outline of the story , but certain other things remain to be said .

		The historical figures -- Charles and
Rupert	LOCATION	,
Cromwell	PERSON	,
Fairfax	LOCATION	, and
Ireton	PERSON	, are no more than sketched , but the strokes are masterly .

		The puritan jargon is reproduced with astonishing vividness and force .

		And the wild passions at play are relieved by certain interludes of comedy pro- vided by the hero 's two French serving-men ,
Alci	PERSON	- biade and Matthieu-Marc-Luc , whose activities pro- vide us with the most amusing Sancho-contrasts to the deeds of our
Greatheart Quixote	PERSON	.

		Again we have a story which is produced by the joint efforts of Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	and Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, and again we are puzzled to know where Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	comes in .

		For of that strong and serious writer , with his love of wild nature and his deep comprehension of the primitive passions of the Dartmoor peasantry , we find no trace in these collaborative inventions .

		His own distinetive work - manship is not to be discovered in `` The Statue , '' which is no more than a melodramatic tale of ingen - ious intrigue , of mysterious crime , and of detection and retribution .

		Taking it upon this low level , the story is effective ; the secret is kept well in hand until the end , and proves satisfying when at last revealed .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	is a writer who repeats him - self unduly , and yet one whose books we always read with interest .

		Just now he offers us two of them , '' By Right of Purchase '' and '' Long Odds . ''

		The former of these two is little more than a replica of his earlier stories of life in the
Ameri	LOCATION	- can
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has its beginnings in
England	LOCATION	, to be sure , for its farmer-hero is there upon a vaca - tion , and there he wins the bride who accompanies him back to the prairies .

		It is his bank account and his acres that really win her and the conquest of her heart remains to be achieved .

		Meanwhile , she makes the sacrifice for the sake of her indolent and improvident family .

		Once fairly established in
Canada	LOCATION	, we have again the story that Mr.
Bind	PERSON	- loss has told so often -LRB- and so well -RRB- before , the story of hard toU for uncertain harvests , woven in with the story of the strong , good man and his foes .

		These foes in the present instance are whiskey - smugglers and cattle-rustlers , and are a particularly desperate gang of scoundrels .

		Of course they are routed in the end , and equally of course the market goes up just in time to save the hero from bank - ruptcy .

		And slowly , as these matters progress toward their logical conclusion , the hero 's wife learns to love him for his manly strength and single-hearted devotion , and gives herself to him in fact as well as in name . ''

		Long Odds '' represents the other of the two interests thus far exploited by Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	in his novels -- the interest which transports us to Latin countries and their peoples , to Spaniards in
Cuba	LOCATION	and to Portuguese in the Canaries .

		Of course , the hero is still an Englishman .

		This time he is an Englishman broken by false accusations , and self - exiled upon the west coast of
Africa	LOCATION	.

		After some years , fortune and good name come back to him , and at this point the story opens .

		He is recalled to the Canaries , where the woman is sojourning whom he had once expected to make his wife , and is given to understand that the old relation may be resumed .

		Accepting the situation , he makes per - functory love to her , but is all the time conscious that their ideals are hopelessly at variance .

		He has lived with grim realities , and she knows and feels nothing beyond her narrow circle of petty social conventions .

		His stay in the Canaries is not for long , however , for he has duties which soon take him back to
Africa	LOCATION	.

		He is pledged to rescue a native girl from a scoundrelly trader , and to re - store to their village a number of boys who have been enslaved .

		Since he is the kind of English - man who does things , both these aims are achieved , and in the achieving of them is the adventurous substance of the tale .

		Its sentimental substance is provided by his relations with the fascinating daughter of a Portuguese oflBcer , whom he knows to be the woman really meant for him , and with whom we leave him after the Englishwoman has found an even more eligible parti , and been suitably dis - posed of without hard feelings on either side .

		Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	shows himself well acquainted with the conditions of existence in the African littoral , and gives us clear descriptions of natives and of such European types as the trader , the missionary , and the government official .

		He has not a little of the incisive power of Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	in dealing with this tropical material .

		William
Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books Editorial Marked by his customary geniality essays from of temper and lightness of touch , The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' ^ jt ^ just enough of artistic detach - ment to lend grace and freedom to his style with - out rendering it too coldly impersonal , Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	's '' Park-Street Papers '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- maintain the high standard of their author 's work as essayist and literary critic .

		The ten chap - ters of the book are gathered from the ten years ' issues of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' that have appeared under Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's editorial supervision .

		The first five , styled collectively `` Atlantic Prologues , '' are brief '' toastmaster addresses , '' such as have in recent years introduced each
January	DATE	number of the magazine .

		They reveal the author in his pleasant - est and most gracefully humorous vein , and at the same time throw light on the ever-fascinating art and mystery of magazine editing .

		The remaining five selections treat of four famous early contribu - tors to the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' --
Hawthorne	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Aldrich	PERSON	-LRB- both contributor and editor -RRB- , and Whit - tier , -- and of that half - forgotten
New England	LOCATION	man of letters who never quite '' arrived , '' who in fact was `` the editor who was never the editor , ''
Francis H. Underwood	PERSON	.

		Centenary celebrations prompted three of these papers , while the death of
Aldrich	PERSON	gave sad occasion for the excellent appre - ciation of his character and work .

		In recalling some of his personal characteristics , the author writes : '' One of the most pleasant traits of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's comments upon men of letters was his unfailing respect and admiration for the well-known group of
New England	LOCATION	writers whose personal friendship he had enjoyed .

		His gift for witty de - rogation found employment elsewhere ; towards
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	PERSON	his at - titude was finely reverent , as befitted a younger associate . ''

		Not always so reverent , however ; as witness his comment on
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's letters , published in his biography , -- '' How good and how poor they are !

		Nearly all of them are too self-conscious .

		Emerson and
Whittier	LOCATION	are about the only men in that famous group who were not thinking about themselves the whole while . ''

		Although its con - tents are of so '' occasional '' a nature , the book is worthy of a permanent place in one 's library .

		A good Nature-book for home read - fo ^ - i ^ ^ ZusT i ° g i ``
rea %	PERCENT	diffi `` `` lt * `` find .

		It may be more difficult to write ; but in `` The Lay of the Land '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	has written one without apparent effort .

		In his youth the author was driven from the laboratory 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, by a professor who thought the '' revelation '' of a dissected dog 's , nervous system ought to take '' all the naoonshine about the beauties of Nature '' out of him .

		But persisting in '' an unscientific love for live dog , '' Mr. Sharp abandoned the scalpel for the fields .

		He retained enough of the scientific temper to keep him accurate and safe from undue romancing , but not enough to kill sentiment . ''

		The botanist who is never poet , '' he says , '' misses as much in the out-of-doors as the poet who is never botanist . ''

		One might say that it is the at-home feeling which distinguishes Mr. Sharp among Nature-writers .

		He believes in staying at home , provided home is not all brick and mortar , and '' getting the honey '' there . ''

		To go to the seashore for one
June	DATE	, to the mountains for a second , to the farm for a third , is not a good way to study the out - of-doors .

		A better way is to spend all three Junes at this shore or upon this same farm .

		The first necessity for interesting Nature study is an intimate acquaintance with some locality .

		It does not matter how small , how commonplace , how near the city , -- the nearer the better , provided there are trees , water , fences , and some seclusion .

		If your own roof-tree stands in the midst of it all , then that is ideal . ''

		Following this primrose path of home-staying , Mr.
Sharp	PERSON	has made his little
Massachusetts	LOCATION	farm a centre of delight for himself and his many readers .

		The present volume has some pleasant
summer	DATE	records of birds-nests and blossoming flowers , but for the most part it tells of the out-door joys of winter -- the muskrat 's snug house , the Christmas woods , the song of the chickadee .

		Indeed , the volume might well have been named from its best chapter , '' A Cure for
Winter	DATE	. ''

		Great Tnovemenu ^ ^ 6 need for a satisfactory historical and leaders in account of the progress of discovery biologic science , ^ nd thought in biology has for a long time been keenly felt , particularly by teachers of the subject and by workers in related subjects , such as sociology or psychology .

		In the case of certain special biological sciences , there are excellent his - tories --
Carus	PERSON	's valuable -LRB- though almost unread - able -RRB- `` Geschichte der Zoologie , '' and Foster 's '' Lectures on the History of Physiology , '' which are not only of great scientific merit , but also have a real literary charm .

		Professor
Locy	PERSON	, in his `` Biology and its Makers '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , has as his aim `` to bring under one view the broad features of biological progress , and to increase the human in - terest by writing the story around the lives of the great Leaders . ''

		While such a plan seems likely to leave something to be desired in the way of com - pleteness and comprehensiveness , it has much to recommend it from the standpoint of those likely to use such a book in connection with the teaching of the biological sciences , or for the purpose of gaining a birdseye view of the scope and development of these sciences .

		Nothing is better calculated to catch and stimulate the interest of one beginning the study of a science than an entertaining account of the personality and ideas of its founders .

		Professor
Locy	PERSON	discusses his material in two group - ings .

		The first part of the book is devoted to the discussion of the development of important bio - logical ideas and lines of work other than those cen - tering about organic evolution .

		This part of the book includes , among other topics , discussions of the rise and progress of histology , comparative anatomy , taxonomy , physiology , embryology , the cell theory , bacteriology , and paleontology .

		The second part deals with the history of evolution work in the strictly biological fields .

		Such separation of the material makes necessary more or less repeti - tion , and appears to have no particular justification other than that of convenience .

		The greater part of the book deals with the zoological side of biology .

		The history of botanical ideas and dis - coveries gets relatively little attention .

		The book is mainly a compilation from rather well-known sources of information .

		There is little evidence that the author has made much detailed study of original sources , the work standing in this respect in marked contrast to Foster 's '' History of
Physi	LOCATION	- ology . ''

		Practically , the only subject that receives really critical treatment is the history of the cell theory .

		While such matters as have been alluded to , together with an unacountably persistent ten - dency to misspell proper names , will cause the specialist to feel some disappointment in the book , they do not essentially mar it for the purpose and the audience for which it was written .

		For this purpose and audience it is on the whole admirably suited .

		It is entertainingly written , and , better than any other existing single work in any language , gives the layman a clear idea of the scope and de - velopment of the broad science of biology .

		tion .

		Some prefatory self-exculpation is not out of place in a new candidate for autobio - graphic honors .

		Gen.
William Franklin Draper	PERSON	, in presenting his `` Recollections of a Varied Career '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , says that he began to write simply with the view of leaving a record for his descendants . ''

		But as I wrote , '' he continues , '' it seemed to me that few lives had covered as wide a field as my own .

		My public experience , -- as a soldier in time of war , a member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	while great questions were under consideration , and a diplomat , also in war time , -- would be hard to equal in variety ; and my private life covers invention in important lines , and a business career , commencing as an employee and closing as the head of a large industrial establishment , perhaps the largest in Mas - sachusetts that is owned by its managers . ''

		Very fittingly , in an etymological sense .

		General
Draper	PERSON	's paternal ancestors for generations back were en - gaged in cloth-manufacture , and he himself , in his cotton-mill experience , has maintained the tradition .

		His connection with the
Draper Co.	ORGANIZATION	machinery works at

		THE DIAL 299 account , from personal recollections and other authoritative sources , of the
Hopedale Community	ORGANIZATION	, which flourished -LRB- if such enterprises can ever be said to flourish -RRB- in the middle of the
last century	DATE	, when , as
Emerson	PERSON	wrote to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, we were '' all a little wild here with numberless projects of social reform , '' and every reading man had a draft of a new community in his waistcoat packet .

		The author 's narration of his
New England	LOCATION	upbringing , his active service as an ardent volunteer in the Civil War , his two terms in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, his ambassadorship at
Rome	LOCATION	, his subsequent travels , and his business and social and domestic interests from first to last , makes good reading .

		It is an unvarnished tale compact of unembroidered reality .

		That men are swayed in practical o7 `` 7r `` .

		tr ^ ff ^ ir `` by subtle and complex and concealed appeals to their mental natiire , gives Psychology a voice in the conduct of life , from ethics and politics to fashion and adver - tising .

		The psychology of the great modern and great American industry of advertising has attracted the attention of Professor
W. D. Scott	PERSON	, of
North	LOCATION	- western
University	ORGANIZATION	, and there results a second volume by him on this topic -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The thesis and consequently the plan of the book are alike simple .

		The advertisement addresses itself to the senses , feelings , prejudices , and mental peculiarities of the prospective purchaser ; some com - prehensible account of these mental procedures will furnish a basis for the preparation of commercial heraldings , and illustrations from `` current litera - ture '' will furnish examples of good and bad types of the art .

		It is well that the task , when done , should be as well done as Professor
Scott	PERSON	does it .

		But the thesis and the book arouse the obvious com - ment that this kind of application is peculiarly complex : that the psychology of the text-book and the psychology of the market-place are not built alike .

		To find a reason for doing what you will decide to do without that reason , may be a pleasing exercise ; but it is not much more .

		Particularly the psychology of the responsive public is altogether too slightingly treated .

		Advertisements do not have the same effect in
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the psychology of Fifth Avenue is not that of the
Bowery	ORGANIZATION	.

		It may happen that the future reader of the back pages of magazines will be so weary of advice as to resolve to boycott all adver - tised commodities ; and the psychology of advertis - ing will have to be in part rewritten , and commer - cial talent find pastures new .

		Astronomical ^ '' ® ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ leading astronomers of references in the
Greenwich Observatory	LOCATION	is Dr. the Scriptures .

		^
Walter Maunder	PERSON	, whose latest excursion into the field of popular astronomy is an explanation of `` The Astronomy of the Bible '' -LRB-
Mitchell Kennerley	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There are many such allu - sions in the Scriptures , which in the author 's opin - ion have not received satisfactory treatment at the hands of commentators because these have not pos - sessed a technical acquaintance with the science of astronomy .

		The author does not attempt to find out the astronomical system of the ancient Hebrew na - tion , as the material is too scanty .

		He first dis - cusses the various Scriptural references to single celestial objects and to constellations , and afterwards studies their use by the Hebrews for measuring time .

		At the close of the book are short studies of three astronomical marvels --
Joshua	PERSON	's long day , the dial of Ahaz , and the star of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, The standpoint of the author is that of a believer in Holy Writ , who is free from those notions of inspiration that modern science has rendered untenable , and is to be classed as a devout man well acquainted with the latest teachings of science and eager to use them in classifying obscurities in the Scriptures .

		In the field of philological criticism -- which Mr.
Maunder	PERSON	necessarily enters -- there is much of uncertainty , and the reader often has a feeling of doubt as to the soundness of some of the writer 's conclusions .

		But on the whole one lays down the book with a feeling that he has gained much of permanent value .

		The attitude of the sacred writers toward the various dis - plays made by the heavenly bodies is shown to be one of intellectual saneness and spiritual exaltation , in marked contrast with that of the heathen nations surrounding the people of
Israel	LOCATION	, who used these bright objects for purposes of divination or of idola - trous worship .

		The book closes with a closely printed table of nearly five hundred references to Biblical passages , chiefly in the Old Testament , the astronomical allusions to which have been touched upon .

1901	DATE	, is now reissued in a revised and greatly improved form , having been rewritten in part and entirely reset , thus making it virtually a new work .

		In this edition the author has incorporated the results of further painstaking study , and investigations made not only in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	but also in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		The descriptions of the various weaves have been largely extended and amplified , thus adding much to the usefulness of the book , which now assumes the proportions of an authorita - tive work .

		Naturally , where there are so many weaves to be described , and specimens of some of them are so rarely seen , the information given varies considerably in extent .

		But it is more important that what is supplied should be accurate than that statements drawn from doubtful sources should be incorporated when only meagre details can be gathered .

		To the care taken to print only what is verifiable , the new edition owes much of its value .

		Two added features are drawings showing clearly the three distinctive forms of knotting used by the 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, rug weavers , and a few of the designs found in rugs .

		This section of the book might with advantage have been considerably extended , -- a pictorial guide , so to speak , as an aid in the identification of the differ - ent weaves , being much needed .

		To some extent this is furnished by the full-page illustrations , which are notable examples of reproduction , giving most faithfully the color and even to some extent the texture of the fabrics represented .

		For the present edition the number of plates has been augmented by three , -- one from an early Italian painting showing oriental rugs decorating a balcony ; one of a remark - able sixteenth century English rug owned by the
Earl of Verulam	ORGANIZATION	; and one of an antique Persian rug of distinguished pattern .

		Professor
Titchener	PERSON	has once more earned the gratitude of the student of psychological problems , by an able presentation of '' The Psychology of Feeling and Attention '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume consists of a course of lectures delivered at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	; and the treatment suitable to a general audience is equally suitable to the general reader .

		The book discusses analytically the ultimate mode of conceiving the nature of the fundamental psychological processes .

		For current usage as coins of the intellectual realm , the value of such terms as feeling , sensation , atten - tion , is sufficiently understood ; but an accurate essay is indispensable when technical definition and analysis are to be reached .

		As an example of the clarification of concepts , as a contribution to the mode of extracting the metal from the crude ore , the work may be strongly recommended to the student analyst .

B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a pretty edition , with portrait , of '' The Love Letters of
Mary WoU	PERSON	- stonecraft to
Gilbert Imlay	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Roger Ing	PERSON	- pen , and furnished with a prefatory memoir . ''

		The Ideal of a Gentleman : A Mirror for Gentle - folks '' is the interesting title of a volume by the English philologist , Dr.
Smythe Palmer	PERSON	, which will be published shortly by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mary
Cowden-Clarke	PERSON	's `` Shakespeare Proverbs , '' first published in
1847	DATE	, is now reissued by the original American publishers , the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, with an intro - duction and notes supphed by Mr.
William J. Rolfe	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Gilbert K. Chesterton	PERSON	's '' Orthodoxy , '' published by the
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	, is reported as being the best-selling book in
London	LOCATION	.

		The first edition has already been exhausted , and a second is coming from the press .

		In addition to his novel '' The Spitfire , '' published a few weeks ago ,
Edward Peple	ORGANIZATION	will issue this autumn a second book under the title of '' The Mallet 's Master - piece . ''

		This is a story built around the mystery of the Venus of
Milo	PERSON	.

		Last year one of the most popular Christmas books was ' ■ The Gentlest Art , '' Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's collection of entertainmg letters .

		This year there is to be a similar collection of American letters , edited by
Elizabeth Deering Hanscom	PERSON	and published under the title , '' The Friendly Craft . '' ''

		An Algebra for Secondary Schools , '' by Professor
E. R. Hedrick	PERSON	, and an '' Elements of Physics , '' by Pro- fessor G `` orge
A. Hoadley	PERSON	, are recent school publica - tions of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same publishers send us '' Teaching a District School , '' a pedagogical manual for young teachers , the work of Professor
John Wirt Dinsmore	PERSON	. ''

		The Taming of the Shrew , '' `` The Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, '' and '' Coriolanus ' are three new volumes in the '' First Folio Shakespeare , '' edited by the Misses
Porter	PERSON	and
Clarke	PERSON	, and published by the Messrs.

F. J. Fnrnivall	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Arthur Ransome	PERSON	is the editor of a series of small volumes called '' The World 's Story Tellers , '' of which
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 301
Poe	PERSON	,
Hoffman	PERSON	, and
Gautier	PERSON	is the cosmopolitan selec - tion offered us in the three volumes now at hand .

		Many others , from
Boccaccio	PERSON	to
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, are to follow .

		Each volume has a frontispiece and an introductory essay .

		A new text-book of '' Economics , '' rather original in plan and method of presentation , but embodying no theoretical novelties , has been written by Messrs.
Scott Nearing	PERSON	and
Frank D. Watson	PERSON	, and is now published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The vogue of
M. Ken ^ Bazin	PERSON	's `` The Nun , '' `` The Coming Harvest , '' and other novels has revived the inter - est in this versatile author 's '' Italians of To-day '' to such an extent that its publishers are reprinting it in Mr.
William Marchant	PERSON	's translation .

		The
Gyldendal Publishing House	ORGANIZATION	,
Copenhagen	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	, announce a '' Mindendgave '' of the collective writings -LRB- thirty-one in number -RRB- of the late Jonas Lie .

		The edition will fill about about seventeen parts of about two hundred pages each , to be published monthly .

		Two volumes of '' Essays by
Mark Pattison	PERSON	'' are now published in the '' New Universal Library '' by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This publication will , no doubt , serve to make the author a personality to a large circle of people who have hitherto known him as little more than , a resounding name .

		The recent excellent translation of '' The Elegies of TibuUus '' by Dr.
Theodore C. Williams	PERSON	, headmaster of the famous
Roxbury Latin School	ORGANIZATION	, has been added to the
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	list .

		Dr.
Williams	PERSON	's new translation of Virgil 's '' JEneid '' will be brought out this month by the same house .

		The second volume of Mr.
G	PERSON	`` orge
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's '' His - tory of English Prosody from the Twelfth Century to the Present Day '' has just been published by the
Mac - millan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		From Shakespeare to
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	is the exten - sive range of this volume , which seems to indicate that one more will complete the work .

		Three recent school-books published by the Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : '' A French Grammar , '' by Messrs.
Hugo P. Thieme	PERSON	and
John R. Effinger	PERSON	; a '' First Course in Biology , '' by Messrs.
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	and
Walter M. Coleman	PERSON	'' ; and an edition of '' Selected Essays of Seneca , '' edited by Dr.
Allan P. Ball	PERSON	.

		The first of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's famous Fairy Book Series , '' The Blue Fairy Book , '' was issued in
1889	DATE	, and every year since has seen a successor .

		The volume for the coming Christmas will be entitled '' The Book of Princes and Princesses , '' and will be written by Mrs.
Lang	PERSON	, though Mr ,
Lang	PERSON	edits the volume and contributes a preface .

		Mr.
William Somerset Maugham	PERSON	, the play-writer , is a most prolific worker , no less than three plays and a novel having been produced by him last year in
England	LOCATION	.

		His play , ''
Jack Straw	PERSON	, '' is attracting much attention from
New York	LOCATION	audiences .

		His novel , '' The Explorer , '' will be published early in
1909	DATE	.

		The chief character in the novel is said to have been drawn from
Cecil Rhodes	PERSON	.

		One of the principal books that
Messrs. Longmans & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish during the present season will be '' The Journal of
Elizabeth Lady Holland	PERSON	, '' edited by the
Earl of Ilchester	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lady
Holland	ORGANIZATION	is known to the readers of memoirs and historical biographies of her time as the domineering leader of the Whig circle ; as a lady whose social talents and literary accomplishments drew to her house the wits , the politicians , and the cognoscenti of the day .

		As yet , however , little has been written of her earlier years , and on these her Journal will throw much light .

		The
Poetical Works of George Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	are about to be added to the '' Oxford Poets '' series , published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		The editors are the Rev.
A. J.	PERSON	and Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	, who have reproduced the author 's own text , with additions and the notes that
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	him - self made .

		The arrangement of the poems is chrono - logical , and the volume contains a photogravure por - trait of the poet .

		Two new autumn novels not hitherto announced will be published in a few weeks .

		One of these is '' The Elusive Pimpernel , '' by
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	, author of '' The Scarlet Pimpernel . ''

		The new story will continue the adventures in the life of the Scarlet Pimpernel , the scene of the story being laid during those exciting years of the French Revolution .

		The other book is '' Mirage , '' by Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	PERSON	, author of '' The Apple of Eden . ''

		Two supplementary volumes of the '' Classified Cata - logue of the Carnegie Library of
Pittsburgh	LOCATION	'' give us the accessions from
1902	DATE	to
1906	DATE	.

		The classification is that used in the three-volume catalogue published over a year ago , and nearly one hundred thousand vol - umes are listed , and , what is more practically interest - ing , annotated in this extension of the foimdation catalogue .

		The work is thus made widely useful for general bibliographical reference .

		Mr.
Henry William Elson	PERSON	's '' History of the
United States of America	LOCATION	'' has been widely and favorably known for several years .

		We may realize how much matter was contained in the single volume when it comes to us expanded into five , and sizable volumes at that .

		Some of the matter is new , but only a small fraction of the whole .

		A large number of illustrations is a feature of the expanded edition which adds greatly to the value of the original unadorned text .

		The
Linschoten Society	ORGANIZATION	, recently organized at
The Hague	LOCATION	, proposes to do for the early Dutch travellers what the
Hakluyt Society	ORGANIZATION	has done for the history of English exploration .

		Linschoten 's '' Itinerario '' heads the list of the proposed issues , which will appear at the rate of two volumes a year .

		The annual fee for ordi - nary membership is four dollars , which will entitle to all publications of the Society .

		The secretary is Mr.
Wouter Nijhoff	PERSON	, 18 Nobelstraat , The Hague .

		Last season President
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, visited
the University of Copen	ORGANIZATION	- hagen and delivered there a series of lectures which attracted much attention .

		These Lectures are shortly to be published by
The Macmillan Company	ORGANIZATION	under the title '' The American as he Is . ''

		Among the special topics with which President
Butler	PERSON	deals are `` The American as a Political Type , '' '' The American Apart from his Government , '' and '' The American and the Intellectual Life . ''

		The third volume of the '' Collections of the
Illinois State Historical Library	ORGANIZATION	'' is the first volume of a '' Lincoln Series , '' and gives us , carefully edited by Dr.
Edwin Erie Sparks	PERSON	, the full text of the Lincoln-Douglas debates , enriched by a large amount of material gleaned from various newspaper files of the period concerned .

		This liberal supply of local color , in the form of both text and picture , provides the present edition with its 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, most distinctive feature , and makes it highly valuable for the student of American political history .

		There are interesting sections upon the humor of the campaign and upon campaign poetry , besides a collection of trib - utes to both debaters , and a bibliography of the subject .

		Dr.
Sparks	PERSON	is to be congratulated upon this informing and scholarly work .

		The headquarters of the
American Library Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion will remain in
Boston	LOCATION	for another year , or at least untU
September 1	DATE	next .

		At the meeting of the Asso - ciation , at
Lake Minnetonka	LOCATION	,
last summer	DATE	, there was a unanimous vote in favor of transferring the headquarters to
Chicago	LOCATION	, as being more central and otherwise more suitable .

		It has been found impracticable , however , to secure quarters in connection with either of the great
Chicago	LOCATION	libraries , as was desired by the Association ; and so the project of removal has been deferred , although not abandoned .

		For the Emancipation episode the Spenserian stanza is employed , and the ballad and ode forms are used to give further variety to a work which seeks historic accuracy while avoiding prosaic statement of fact .

		BRIEFER MENTION 350 NOTES 350 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 351 PRESIDENT ELIOT .

		It is something of a coincidence that the day which determined the result of the recent Presi - dential election should also have been the day upon which the President of
Harvard Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity announced his resignation of the office which he has so long and so honorably held .

		When he assumed it ,
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	had just entered upon his duties as the official head of the nation , and during President
Eliot	PERSON	's incumbency the country has felt the throes of ten Presidential campaigns , torn each time by passions more or less violent .

		Meanwhile , during all these forty years
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has pursued its even course , its development free from recurrent seasons of unrest , and has known the benefits of firm and wise administration , of a progressive policy steadfastly pursued .

		Here is a contrast indeed , and one that offers matter for reflection .

		The parallel of microcosm and macrocosm often proves instructive , and has rarely proved more so than in the instance now offered .

		The man - agement of a great and rapidly growing institu - tion of learning presents , in little , many of the problems involved in the government of a people ; the political republic and the republic of scholars have many features in common .

		Both must react upon the pressure of the Zeitgeist , and shape themselves to an ever-changing environment ; both are required , as a condition of their self - perpetuation , to adhere to certain fundamental principles of action , and to oppose a conservative resistance to the onslaughts of radicalism .

		In meeting the difficulty thus common to the two re - publics , it seems to us that
Cambridge	LOCATION	, as com - pared with
Washington	LOCATION	, has found the better way .

		Harvard is now well along toward the comple - tion of its third century , and '' the college '' of the
Bay Colony	ORGANIZATION	-- first fruit of the sifted grain wherewith this
Western	LOCATION	world was planted -- has grown into the great university of our own time .

		Of its twenty-two presidents , Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	has had the longest term , and to find another of approximate duration we must go back an exact century from the date of his appointment ; for it was in
1769	DATE	that
Edward Holyoke	ORGANIZATION	ended a presidential term of thirty-two years .

		But merely to say that Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	's term has been the longest of all , would be a very inadequate statement of its comparative importance .

		In almost every respect to which the test of figures 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, may be applied , its accomplishment may be fairly put in the balance against all that had been accomplished during the two centuries , more or less , that preceded it .

		The mass of its product outweighs all that came before ; and if this were the only test to be applied , the argu - ment would be quickly ended .

		But we should be the last to admit that educational achieve - ment is a matter of statistics alone , and upon the more delicate question of the spiritual bal - ance much may be urged in behaK of the earlier and less pretentious periods of the college his - tory .

		For strenuous devotion to an austere ideal , the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	of the
Mathers	PERSON	does not suffer in comparison with any
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	of more recent years , and the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	that sent forth into the service of the imperilled nation '' Her wisest scholars , those who understood The deeper teaching of her mystic tome , And offered their fresh hves to make it good , '' realized an ethical standard which the future
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	may emulate , but will hardly , improve upon .

		President
Eliot	PERSON	's administration has fallen in pleasanter times that those of puritan combats with '' that old deluder Satan , '' or than those of ensanguined civil strife ; but who shall say that
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has ceased to do resolute bat - tle with the powers of evil that still subtly men - ace our civilization ?

		We may fittingly answer that question by recalling the gentle and heroic spirit that forsook its earthly tenement a few days ago at Shady Hill .

		We wonder how many of the men who were teaching chemistry twenty or thirty years ago , and making use of Eliot and
Storer	PERSON	's admirable elementary text , were conscious of the fact that the book was chiefly written by the Presi - dent of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		For it was as a chemist that Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	won his early reputation for scholar - ship ; and when he succeeded Hill in
1869	DATE	, at the age of thirty-five , his only certain academic title was that of a successful teacher of science , trained in the best foreign schools , although it was shrewdly suspected that he might possess other qualifications for his new post .

		The appointment was a break with tradition in more respects than one .

		It is true that
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	had long before forsaken the belief that a college president must be a clergyman , but it had at least maintained that he should be a man of distinction in the field of the humanities , and that he should have reached a reasonable if not a venerable age .

		Many heads wagged solemnly when the long line of precedent was broken , and the most important collegiate presidency in
America	LOCATION	entrusted to a youth whose specialty was a subject only just beginning to be recog - nized as having any claims at all to serious consideration in a college curriculum .

		The bones of
Increase Mather	ORGANIZATION	must have become restless in their grave at such a perversion of a stately office .

		Four decades have passed since then , and the young man whose career was yet to make has more than justified the confidence of those who were responsible for his selection .

		His influence has grown more and more com - manding , until now , at the time of his retire - ment from active work , he is clearly seen to have been for many years past the leader of the educational profession in
America	LOCATION	.

		Of all the changes brought about by Presi - dent
Eliot	ORGANIZATION	's influence , the most important has been that of the introduction of the elective sys - tem into his own college , and its general exten - sion to other institutions .

		It was a greatly needed reform , for the attitude of professional education toward the new subjects , which forty years ago were clamoring for adequate recogni - tion in college courses , was not generous .

		The traditional curriculum was hidebound and its application Procrustean .

		New light and fresh air were brought into college life when science came to its own , and when the student began to be treated as an individual , for whom the best mental sustenance was not necessarily that which was best for some other individual .

		When the reform once got headway , it went too far , as all reforms tend to go , and the new men teaching the new subjects grew arrogant in their bear - ing .

		As we have frequently urged of late years , the reform now chiefly needed is one that shall take the direction of a reaction from the pres - ent undue preponderance of the new subjects .

		The demand that the humanities should be again exalted , and that science should be '' shown its place , '' is now something other than a recrudes - cence of old-f ogyism ; it is rather the expression of the sanest and best poised educational thought .

		But for all this , the pioneer work begun at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	forty years ago was neces - sary and altogether admirable in its intention .

		We believe , however , that Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	has come dangerously near to making a fetish of his theory that all subjects are potentially equal in educational value .

		This theory bears about the same relation to practical conditions that is borne by the theory of the philosophical anar - chist .

		Men might become virtuous enough to dispense with all repressive government ; the teaching of engineering or sociology might be made as pedagogically effective as the teaching of literature or the classics .

		But neither con -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 333 dition is now even approximately realized , or gives signs of becoming realizable in any near future .

		Mr.
Eliot	PERSON	entered upon his career as a special - ist in the ordinary sense ; he made himself a specialist in general ideas .

		By this paradoxical statement we mean that he developed an extra - ordinary capacity for grasping the essential con - tent of many systems of ideas , and acquired at the same time an extraordinary power of clean - cut and logical expression .

		His great admin - istrative abilities were the chief source of his strength in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, but they alone could not have given him the position which he occupied in the thought of the general public .

		It was because he could talk , simply and per - suasively , to almost any kind of an audience upon almost any subject of large general inter - est , because what he said was free from false notes , logically ordered , and characterized by sanity of judgment , that he gradually came to be , what all now know him to be , a real leader of opinion , not only in the educational field , but also in those of economics and politics , of religion and ethics , -- all those fields , in short , with which man is deeply concerned as a social and spiritual being .

		And this leadership , we trust , he will still exercise for many years to come ; for it need be in no way affected by the fact that he has chosen to transmit to other hands his particular work of university administration .

		THE BACON TERCENTENARY AT GRATS INN .

		The 300th anniversary of the election of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	as Treasurer of Gray 's Inn was celebrated in that
Inn of Court	ORGANIZATION	on
Saturday , October 17	DATE	.

		There was a luncheon at which the
Benchers	ORGANIZATION	entertained many distinguished guests ; there were speeches by the present Treasurer and by the
American Ambas	ORGANIZATION	- sador ; and there was a loan exhibition of Baconiana in the
Benchers	ORGANIZATION	' Library .

		Francis Bacon became an '' Ancient '' of the Honourable Society of Gray 's Inn towards the end of his fifteenth year , and maintained the connection for the rest of his life .

		His father , Sir
Nicholas Bacon	PERSON	, the Lord Keeper , was a member , and so also were all of his four brothers ,
Nicholas	PERSON	,
Nathaniel	PERSON	,
Edward	ORGANIZATION	, and
Anthony	PERSON	, his uncle
William Cecil	PERSON	the Lord Treasurer , and his cousin
Robert Cecil	PERSON	.

		Sir
Nicholas Bacon	PERSON	had been Treasurer fifty years before his most famous son was elected to that ofiice , and it was during his Treasurership that the quaint Elizabethan hall was built where the
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	anniver - sary took place .

		When the death of Sir
Nicholas Bacon	PERSON	, in
1579	DATE	, closed
Francis Bacon	PERSON	's diplomatic career , and left him dependent upon his own exertions , he returned from
France	LOCATION	and took the place of
Anthony Bacon	PERSON	in his father 's old chambers , in Coney-court , near the hall , where No. 1 Gray 's - inn-square now stands .

		Dr.
William Rawley	PERSON	,
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's chaplain and first biographer , says : '' He seated himself , for the commodity of his studies and practice , amongst the
Honourable Society of Gray	ORGANIZATION	's Inn ; of which
House	ORGANIZATION	he was a member : where he erected that ele - gant pile or structure , commonly known by the name of
The Lord Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's Lodgings , which he inhabited , by turns the most part of his life -LRB- some few years only excepted -RRB- unto his dying day . ''

		The Pension Book -LRB- minutes -RRB- of Gray 's Inn rec - ords many incidents of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's life there as
Bencher	LOCATION	, Reader , and Treasurer .

		In his 25th year , '' 10 Feb : 28 Eliz : '' he was admitted to the Readers ' table , two years before he actually became Reader ; he was elected Reader in
1588	DATE	, and
Double Reader	ORGANIZATION	in
1600	DATE	.

		In
1589	DATE	he served as Dean of the
Chapel	LOCATION	, and in
1594	DATE	as Deputy Treasurer .

		His Treasurer - ship seems to have lasted from
1608	DATE	to his elevation to the Great Seal in
1617	DATE	, an unusually long term .

		It was from his Lodgings in Gray 's Inn that the new Lord Keeper set out in state for Westminister Hall on the first day of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	term ,
1617	DATE	, `` with the Lord Treasurer on his right hand , the Lord Privy Seal on his left , a long procession of students and ushers before him , and a guard of peers ,
Privy Councillors	ORGANIZATION	, and judges following in his train . ''

		In Gray 's Inn he found refuge
five years later	DATE	, after his fall from place and power .

		His high ofiices had separated him for a time from his brothers of the Inn , but they received him again gladly .

		The Pension Book shows that they extended the grant of the lodg - ings he had built upon the late chambers of his father , so that he might have a saleable interest in them .

		`` Myself for quiet , and the better to hold out , '' Bacon wrote in
1622	DATE	, to Sir
Francis Coltington	PERSON	, `` am retired to Gray 's Inn , for when my chief friends were gone so far , it was time for me to go to a ceU . ''

		From that cell during those busy last five years there came five books .

		He composed his Historic of the
Raigne of King Henry the Seventh	ORGANIZATION	in
the first summer	DATE	of his enforced retire - ment .

		In
1623	DATE	he published the Latin version of The Advancement of Learning , now issued in nine books with the title De Augmentis Scientiarum .

		The poet
George Herbert	PERSON	is said to have helped him with the translation .

		His Apophthegmes New and Old ,
1624	DATE	, can only be said to have been the occupation of a morning in the sense that he may have arranged the order of the stories in one morn - ing .

		The last three years were spent in writing his
Sylva Sylvarum	PERSON	; or A
Natural History	ORGANIZATION	, and in editing the third and final edition of his Essays .

		This edition , published in
1625	DATE	, contains the fifty - eight essays of all subsequent editions , and was entitled Essayes or Counsels Civill and
Morall	PERSON	.

		Bacon 's chambers oveilooked the gardens of Gray 's Inn , and we learn from the Pension Book that it was he who laid out gardens where before his time there had been walks only . ''

		Pension , 5 Feb : 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, 33 Eliz : '' reads : '' Ordered that a brick wall shalbe erected to enclose parts of our back field , but how much thereof & where the wall shalbe sett & for the tyme when the same shalbe done , it is referred to the survey & direction of Mr. Anger , Mr.
Stanhope	PERSON	, Mr.
Daniell	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	, & they to make report of their doings therein . ''

		In
1597	DATE	it is ordered that # 7 15s .

		4d. , '' due to Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	for plantynge of trees in the walkes shalbe payde next terme , as soone as money commeth in . ''

		The following year a '' new rayle and quicksett hedge '' was to be '' set uppon the upper long walke at the good discretion of Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	and Mr.
Wilbraham	PERSON	. ''


April 29 , 1600	DATE	, it was voted '' that there shalbe payed and allowed unto Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	for money disbursed about the garnishinge & furnish - inge of the walkes as by & upon his account , '' # 60 6s .

		8d .

		Pepys speaks of Gray 's Inn gardens as a '' fashion - able lounge , '' and 200 years after
Bacon	PERSON	's time Charles Lamb thought them the best gardens of any of the
Inns of Court	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the essay Of Gardens ,
Bacon	PERSON	says he wishes '' in the very middle '' of the main garden '' a fair mount , '' '' and the whole mount to be thirty foot high ; and some fine banqueting - house , with some chimneys neatly cast , and without too much glass . ''

		On the present site of
Raymond	PERSON	- buildings , down to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's time , there was such a mound in Gray 's Inn gardens , and on it a
summer	DATE	- house which bore an inscription to the effect that it was built in
1609	DATE	, by
Francis Bacon	PERSON	, Solicitor - General to the
King	ORGANIZATION	, in memory of
Jeremy Betten	PERSON	- ham .

		Of Bettenham , who had been both Reader and Treasurer , the Pension Book says frankly , he `` hath gained little profit by the law , '' but
Bacon	PERSON	, his executor , describes him as '' a man innocent and con - templative . ''


Jeremy Bettenham	PERSON	lives to-day in two of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's Apothegms , both dealing with gardens : `` Mr.
Bettenham	PERSON	used to say : That riches were like tmick ; when it lay upon an heap , it gave hut a stench and an ill odour ; hut when it was spread upon the ground , then it was cause of much fruit '' This thought
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	epitomizes in the essay Of Seditions and Troubles , into '' Money is like muck , not good except it be spread . ''

		So again , in Of Ad - versity ^ the figure , '' Virtue is like precious odours , most fragi-ant when they are incensed or crushed , '' is
Jeremy Bettenham	PERSON	's saying , '' That virtuous men were like some herbs and spices , that give not their sweet smell , till they be broken and crushed . ''

		Bacon says he would have '' whole alleys '' in his garden set with burnet , wild-thyme , and watermints , because they '' perfume the air most delightfully , '' '' being trodden upon and crushed . '' ''

		I trust , '' Lady
Anne Bacon	PERSON	wrote to her son
Anthony	PERSON	, in
1594	DATE	, '' that they will not mum nor masque , nor sinfully revel at Gray 's Inn . ''

		First and last they revelled a good deal at
Gray	ORGANIZATION	's Inn , and their best maker of masques was Lady
Anne Bacon	PERSON	's younger son , who was the author or '' chief contriver '' or '' chief encourager '' of no less than six
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan masques , an experience of writing in lighter vein that produced the essay Of Masques and
Tri	ORGANIZATION	- umphs .

		Bacon 's first Gray 's Inn '' device '' was for a revel in the very year of his pious mother 's letter .

		In
1613	DATE	he was the '' chief contriver '' of
Francis Beaumont	PERSON	's masque , The Marriage of the Thames and the
Rhine	LOCATION	, which was performed by the gen - tlemen of the
Inner Temple	ORGANIZATION	and Gray 's Inn before the
King and Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, in honor of the marriage of the Princess
Elizabeth	PERSON	with the
Count Palatine	LOCATION	.

		On Twelfth Night in the following year ,
January 6 , 1614	DATE	, the gentlemen of Gray 's Inn pre - sented
The Masque of Flowers	ORGANIZATION	, in celebration of the marriage of the
Earl of Somerset	ORGANIZATION	and
Lady Francis Howard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
Francis Bacon	PERSON	, the new Attorney - General , was the `` chief encourager '' of this masque , which is said to have cost him #
2000	DATE	.

		We even hear of the Lord Chancellor dining at Gray 's Inn on Candlemas Day , `` to give countenance to theyre Lord or Prince of Purpoole and to see theyre revells , '' On a cold raw day in the
early spring	DATE	,
April 2 , 1626	DATE	, during a drive from Gi'ay 's Inn to dine with the
King 's Scotch	ORGANIZATION	physician , T -RRB- r. Witherborne ,
Bacon	PERSON	made his last experiment , an early attempt in refrigeration .

		He was seized with a chill , and , unable to get home to Gray 's Inn , he died a week later at
Highgate	LOCATION	, the involuntary guest of the
Earl of Arundel	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is announced that the Benchers propose here - after to observe the first night of term ,
November 2	DATE	, as a
Bacon Anniversary	ORGANIZATION	, and that they will place a permanent memorial of the Lord Chancellor in one of the open spaces of the Inn -- probably South - square .

		This meniorial is to be a marble statue of Bacon by Mr.
F. W. Pomeroy	PERSON	, A.R.A. .

		A sketch model of it was on view at the Tercentenary , together with a collection of
Baconian MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		and printed books , some owned by the Benchers and some loaned for the occasion .

		Among the distinguished guests were Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	, Sir
Robert Ball	PERSON	, Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	,
Canon Beeching	ORGANIZATION	,
Canon Hensley Henson	ORGANIZATION	,
Lord Strathcona	LOCATION	, Dr.
A.W. Ward	PERSON	, Master of Peterhouse , Sir
S. Evans	PERSON	, Solicitor - General , Sir
W. S. Robson	PERSON	, Attorney-General , the
Earl of Verulam	ORGANIZATION	, and many others .

		After toasts to '' The King '' and '' Domus , '' the Treasurer , Mr.
Duke	PERSON	, responded to the sentiment `` The Immor - tal Memory of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	. ''

		His speech was an interesting account of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's long life among them -- forty-six years .

		Ambassador
Reid	PERSON	spoke for '' The Guests . ''

		He told the Benchers that if
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's whole connection with the legal profession was left out of account , his fame would stand be - fore the world practically the same .

		Mr.
Reid	PERSON	might have quoted , but did not ,
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's own almost divine satisfaction with his work as very good .

		Dedicating the third edition of his Essays to the
Duke of Buckingham	ORGANIZATION	, in
1625	DATE	, he wrote : '' For I do conceive that the Latin volume of them -LRB- being in the universal language -RRB- may last as long as books last . ''

		THE DIAJ ^ 335 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A '' NATIONAL LANGUAGE '' FOB THE UnITED States seems a wild notion now , but it was the dream of
Noah Webster	PERSON	, our foremost lexicog - rapher , and a writer of widely-used school text - books , whose sesqui-centennial was appropriately celebrated last month in his native state ,
Connecti	LOCATION	- cut , where he was born -LRB- at
Hartford	LOCATION	-RRB-
October 16 , 1758	DATE	.

		It was fitting that the public schools and the university that graduated him should hold com - memorative exercises for this worker in the cause of popular education .

		How much else besides writing spelling-books and grammars and dictionaries he turned his hand to , as a typical
Connecticut Yankee	ORGANIZATION	, it would take considerable space to relate .

		He fought , under his father 's captainship , in the Revo - lutionary War ; he studied and practised law , and sat on the judicial bench for a brief period ; he edited a succession of periodicals , none of which , however , contributed greatly to his fame or fortune ; he put forth political and philological and miscel - laneous writings in great number and variety ; he helped to found
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	, and was for sev - eral years the president of its board of trustees ; he travelled and studied abroad in preparing his mag - num optis , his '' American Dictionary of the English Language '' ; and , in a moment of extraordinary hardihood , and inspired by patriotic impulses , he undertook to reform the spelling of our mother tongue to accord with our independence of the mother country . ''

		Now is the time , '' he proclaims to his compatriots in issuing his Dictionary , '' and this the country , in which we may expect success in attempting changes favorable to language , science , and government ... Let us then seize the present moment and establish a national language as a national government . ''

		The sort of reforms proposed by this sedulous patriot may be inferred from the following examples of tentative forms that make strange the pages of the first edition -LRB-
1828	DATE	-RRB- of his Dictionary : ake , aker , groop , tung , wo , crum , maiz , f ether , steddy , ribin , skain , porpess .

		It must needs be that offenses come , but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh .

		Most of these affronts to language were scoffed and hooted into inglorious retreat in later issues .

		But of the orthographic ills that were to follow , in the next century , from his example , he can have dreamed as little as that his work would develop into that monument of Ameri - can scholarship , the great
International Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	.

		• • • The shameful estate of the English novel is pitilessly exposed to view in a recent magazine article on `` The Censorship of Fiction , '' by Mr.
Bram Stoker	PERSON	, who has already elicited a word of comment from us by his zealous and somewhat sur - prising advocacy of a muzzle for the novel-printing press .

		And now he puts the question again , vehe - mently and in words that burn , -- '' Are we or are we not ultimately to allow fiction to be put forth with - out any form of restraint whatever ?

		The question is not merely a civic or national one .

		It is racial , all-embracing , human .

		Fiction is perhaps the most powerful form of teaching available .

		It can be most potent for good ; and if we are to allow it to work for evil we shall surely have to pay in time for the consequent evil effects . ''

		He does not hesitate to declare that '' within a couple of years past quite a number of novels have been published in
England	LOCATION	that would be a disgrace to any country even less civi - lised than our own '' ; and , further , in the production of these discreditable books he asserts that '' women are the worst offenders . ''

		The situation is evidently worse in
England	LOCATION	than in this country ; in fact , the majority of the most objectionable novels in English published in the last year or two have come to us from across the water .

		Still , we have enough sins of our own to answer for , to preclude stone-casting at our neighbors .

		Fortunately , the most of these deleterious novels are not only repulsively vulgar but intolerably dull ; and thus they carry with them , in a way , their own antidote .

		A comedy from a librarian 's pen -- an '' act - ing comedy , '' too , and a successful one if reports are to be credited -- is surely a phenomenon in the literary - theatrical-bibliothecal world .

		To the scan - dal of some of his fellow-librarians , and to the amusement of others .

		Dr.
Emmanuel Gottlieb Baum	PERSON	- wollenstrumpf .

		Librarian Emeritus and
Professor of Bibliography and Library Economy	ORGANIZATION	at
Ulpian Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity , has written a one-act curtain-raiser entitled ''
Minnie	PERSON	's Mistakes '' -- a name which some may recall as that of the play so cleverly presented at the Junior Dramatics at
Ulpian	LOCATION
last year	DATE	.

		Its bril - liant success at the hands of amateurs led to an ap - plication for the stage-rights from a prominent theatre-manager , and with the renewed success of the little comedy as professionally acted there has leaked out the hitherto withheld name of the author .

		We are fortunate in being able to give a few interesting details of the play 's genesis and his - tory .

		As is already well known .

		Dr.
BaumwoUen	PERSON	- strumpf is the author of several learned works , among which his monograph on '' Accessions-List Practice in Roman Libraries of the Second Cen - tury '' is perhaps the most famous , although his '' Prolegomena to the Study of Finger-marks in Ancient Manuscripts '' has been much admired for its scholarly and at the same time vivacious style .

		About two years ago it chanced that on coming out from a meeting of
the International Association of Critical Commentators	ORGANIZATION	, of which he is vice-president , he was jocosely taimted by a passing acquaintance , an author of popular books in several departments of polite literature , for confining his literary ener - gies to works so dry and dusty and musty that no reader could open them without sneezing his head off .

		The professor took umbrage at this , and , to prove that profound critical scholarship and so-called creative authorship are not always divorced , he sat 336 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, down as soon as he reached his hotel and wrote ** Minnie 's Mistakes , '' which , as above stated , he first tried on the Ulpian students .

		Some excite - ment ovei ' this event is to be expected in the library world -- some such excitement , in fact , as has at - tended the publication , in `` The Southern Cross '' for
September	DATE	, of Dr.
Pilnitz	PERSON	's short story , `` Quite Another Matter '' -- Dr.
Pilnitz	PERSON	being , as a news - paper paragraph informs us , and as doubtless may be learned by consulting '' Who 's Who in
Austral	LOCATION	- asia , '' librarian of the
Melbourne Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , after all , these exhibitions of unsuspected versatility are not at all alarming , nor are they very abnormal or incredible .

		Did not a distinguished English mathematician give us `` Alice 's Adventures in
Wonderland	LOCATION	'' and '' Through the Looking-Glass , '' and did not an eminent landscape painter produce some admirable nonsense verses ?

		We welcome these proofs of intellectual agility , from whatever quarter they may come ; and we feel assured that all enlightened librarians will view the matter as we do .

		... A WHOLESOME DECLINE IN BOOK-CIRCULATION may seem to librarians to be a contradiction in terms ; but a qualitative instead of a quantitative analysis of a library 's activities sometimes discovers encouraging symptoms in such a decline .

		The latest report of the well-managed and progressive
Hartford Public Library	ORGANIZATION	dwells at some length on the increasing need of careful selection in the purchase of novels for circulation at the tax-payer 's expense .

		Never before has the book world seen so large an output of fiction , and that means that never before has there been so large a supply of mediocre and inferior novels .

		By turning the current-fiction toper to the circulating library , the public library may lose an opportunity to swell its sum total of books loaned , but it gains in ability to complete its stock of stand - ard works and thus to raise the quality -- and per - haps , in the long run , the quantity too -- of its own circulation .

		The need of a supply , a large supply , of novels , old and new , is undeniable .

		Many a reader can recall how a story-book , perhaps of no superlative excellence , has in some hour of dulness or discouragement , stimulated him to seek and find pleasure and profit in some totally different book of a higher order .

		In their purchase of books , espe - cially of fiction , our public libraries can in a measure perform the office of public censor ; and some such censorship of the press as this is the only one to be seriously advocated .

		The SUBLIME confidence OF GENIUS always compels admiration .

		Even the whimsical oddities of a
Whistler	LOCATION	are the index of character .

		Among the memories of musicians which are much in vogue just now , there is one concerning the pianist
Pade	PERSON	- rewski that happily illustrates the audacity of genius .

		From the current number of `` Etude '' we learn that this gifted Pole , in the days when he was teaching at the
Strasburg Conservatory of Music	ORGANIZATION	, suddenly resigned his position and prepared to make his appearance in public , because he was refused a slight addition to his monthly pay at the Conservatory .

		This occurred in the
autumn of 1889	DATE	, and the re - lator of the incident was one of the scant three hun - dred in attendance at the Polish pianist 's dSbut in
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		I shall never forget , '' he writes , '' the thin , pale , almost cadaverous-looking young man who stepped upon the platform of that little hall .

		At first he awakened only an admiring interest , although everyone recognized the beauty of his tone coloring ; but when he finished playing
Beethoven	PERSON	's ' Appas - sionata Sonata ' the audience rose as one man and cheered themselves hoarse .

		Here at last was deserved recognition , and from that moment
Paderewski	ORGANIZATION	's success was assured .

		The following week he played at one of the Lameroux concerts to an audience of 3000 people , and the same scenes of excitement followed . ''

		This and the triumphs that have followed , thick and fast , the writer attri - butes to the young performer 's courage in abandon - ing a sure position , modest and humdrum , for a splendid uncertainty -- or what would have been an uncertainty in the case of nine hundred and ninety - nine out of a thousand discontented youths .

		• • • The children 's story-hour at the public LIBRARY has been praised as a blessing and a benefit to the eagerly acquisitive young , and it has also been censured as an unauthorized and wasteful use of the library worker 's time .

		There is much to be said both ^ ro and con .

		Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	utters some energetic words on the side of the plaintiff in a highly readable contribution to '' Public Libraries . ''

		He urges that instead of calling on a library assistant for the time and energy that effective story-telling -LRB- including the preparation for it -RRB- requires , the same assistant might more profitably instruct a body of school-teachers in the art of story-telling , and let them do the entertaining of their little ones in the school - room .

		This , of course , presupposes special story - telling talent in the assistant and its lack in the teachers .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	thus concludes : `` A library gives of its time , money , and energy , to instruct 40 children -- and there it ends .

		If , on the other hand , it instructs 40 teachers , those 40 carry the instruction to 40 classrooms and impart knowledge of the lib - rary , of the use of books , of the literature for children , and -- if need be -- of the art of story-telling , to 1600 or
2000	DATE	children .

		There seems no question here as to which of these two forms of educational activity is for librarians better worth while . ''

		• • • The delivery of library books to the pub - lic is growing more and more common throughout the country .

		THE DIAL 337 makes use of more than twice as many distributing centres .

		Its Nineteenth Annual Report gives the number as 494 , an increase of 465 in five years . ''

		This increase , '' says the librarian , '' of course adds somewhat to the cost of distribution , it being easier to lend a thousand volumes from a main building than from a number of widely separated centres .

		But the extension of library privileges to distant parts of the city seemed to meet with approval . ''

		Naturally it did ; yet one can not but query whether there is not such a thing as making books too easily obtainable .

		Many examples could be given of young men , afterward illustrious , who have gladly walked miles to borrow a coveted book , returning it perhaps for another after a month 's digestion of its contents .

		The writer of this vividly remembers the time when the weekly milewalk to the public library for a new book was a noteworthy and a joy - ful event in his young life .

		What comparable exhil - aration would there have been in running to the corner drug-store or the nearest engine-house to sup - ply his literary needs ?

		A late trans - oceanic rumor , however , avers that , acting on the suggestion of an American visitor to the

		HAVE WE A NATIONAL ANTHEM ?

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		I have read with interest your comments on '' A National Anthem to Order , '' in connection with the offer -LRB- a rather absurd one , as it seems to me -RRB- made by the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	, of prizes for the best productions designed to supersede ''
America	LOCATION	'' and '' The Star-Spangled Banner . ''

		This is not the first time that prizes for a similar purpose have been offered , but without result , -- as will doubt - less be the case with this recent effort .

		National hymns , as you well say , can not be made to order ; they are produced , not for the sake of prize-money , but in some moment of poetic and patriotic inspira - tion over a great national crisis .

		To repeat your words , ' `` The Watch on the Rhine , ' and ` The Marseillaise ' were not begotten of prize-offers from any institute of art and letters . ''

		Neither , I may add , was our own '' Star-Spangled Banner , '' which I claim as our true national anthem , and which is officially recognized as such , more than any other .

		I append a letter written me from the War Depart - ment , which should settle the question as to the atti - tude of those in authority .

		Madam : -- Referring to your recent letter , with enclos - ure , relative to the adoption of the song entitled '' The Star Spangled Banner '' as the national anthem , I beg to inform you that while the
Government	ORGANIZATION	has not adopted by law a national anthem or national air , paragraph 512 ,
U.S. Army Regulations	ORGANIZATION	,

		The flag will be lowered at the sounding of the last note of the retreat , and while the flag is being lowered , the band will play ' The Star Spangled Banner . ' ''

		It is also understood that a paragraph has recently been added to the
Navy Regulations	ORGANIZATION	, which reads as follows : '' All officers and men shall stand at attention whenever ' The Star Spangled Banner ' is being played unless engaged in duty that wiU not permit them to do so .

		The same respect shall be observed towards the national air of any other coun - try , when played in the presence of official representatives of such country . '' '

Flynt	PERSON	had the field to himself ; there is no one to take his place at present .

		Few men who live and know the life of the Under World , as he did , have his mental equipment .

		Many can retain the facts , but are unable to handle them as satisfactorily ; then , too , to be a friend and companion of tramps and criminals , and of men like
Tolstoi	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, is to possess a wide range of octaves in human experience and men - tal grasp . ''


Walter Wyckoff	PERSON	's graphic pen - pictures of life and labor in the lower strata of our wage-earners were , like
Josiah Flynt	PERSON	's more rudely rendered portraits of criminals and accounts of their habits , the outcome of per - sonal experience .

		But no one at present is doing just the kind of work they chose for themselves .

		Others , however , will hear the '' call of the road '' and feel the impulse to see and to live the life of the '' other half , '' although scarcely one in a century will possess
Flynt	PERSON	's extraordi - nary genius for transforming himself at will into the very type of vagabondage or criminal - ity he selected as the object of his study .

		Undersized , thin , white , shrivelled , nervous , pursued by a demon of unrest , in early life con - fessedly unable to distinguish the tuum from the meum , as well as unable or unwilling to re - frain from falsehood and deception , and finally the victim of drink ,
Flynt	PERSON	was no bad specimen of physical and moral degeneration , the more marked because of his excellent pedigree on both the paternal and the maternal side -- his ancestors being of the best

Flynt	LOCATION	that he could bring a coolly impersonal scrutiny to bear on those laxities and abnormalities that formed so large a part of his own being .

		youth , are all more or less concealed or dis - guised or misrepresented .

		It may be worth while to make clear , so far as we can , some of the actual facts relating to his birth and upbringing .


Josiah Flynt Willard	PERSON	-- thus his name is given in full by the compilers of biographical dictionaries -- was bom
January 23 , 1869	DATE	, at
Appleton	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		He himself conveys the impression that he was born at
Evanston	LOCATION	,
Illi	PERSON	- nois .

		His father ,
Oliver Atherton Willard	PERSON	, a Methodist minister , and , later , a journalist , was directly descended from that Major
Simon Willard	PERSON	who helped to settle the town of Con - cord ,
Mass.	LOCATION	, was for forty years a prominent citizen of that place , held the office of town clerk a number of years , and also represented his district in the colonial legislature .

		It is apparently from
Oliver	PERSON	's father ,
Josiah Flint WiUard	PERSON	, that the younger
Josiah	PERSON	got his pen - name of
Josiah Flynt	PERSON	, by the change of one letter .

		On his mother 's side , he was a descend - ant of the godly family of Mather of
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts .

		Furthermore ,
Frances E. Willard	PERSON	, the famous temperance advocate , was
Josiah	PERSON	's aimt on the father 's side , although the book repre - sents her as a '' maternal '' aunt .

		After the death of
Oliver A. Willard	PERSON	, when
Josiah	PERSON	was but eight years old , the family made their home in an annex built on to the '' grand - mother 's house , not far from the main street '' -- of
Evanston	LOCATION	, the reader infers .

		Here they seem to have remained until the restless son , who had been a runaway and a truant from baby - hood , was old enough to go to a boarding-school , whence he soon made his escape , as might have been expected .

		Of this home-leaving he writes : '' When we left this home the family became scat - tered , one going one way and the others some other way ; we have never all been together since the break - up .

		My brother , for instance , I have not seen in nearly twenty years , and have no idea where he is to-day .

		He also was possessed of
Wanderlust	LOCATION	, indeed we might as well call ourselves a Wanderlust family , because every one of us has covered more territory at home and abroad than the average person can find time , or cares , to explore . ''

		A trial of college life at '' a small
Illinois	LOCATION	college , '' where by some miracle the lad suc - ceeded in holding himself down to the routine of study and chapel and recitations for two years , proved not very successful or very rich in permanent results .

		The young collegian , as wanderlustig as ever , again took the road and revelled in the delights of irresponsible vaga - bondage , relieving the tedium of tramping with
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 an occasional horse-theft or horse-loan , and a carriage-drive at some involuntary benefactor 's expense .

		His experiences in '' tramping with tramps , '' as coal-stoker on an ocean liner , as student at
Berlin University	ORGANIZATION	, newspaper re - porter in
Russia	LOCATION	and elsewhere , visitor at Count Tolstoi s country home , special detective in rail - way and police service , and what else it would be hard to enumerate , are more or less familiar to readers of magazines , and to those who have looked into
Josiah Flynts	PERSON	half-dozen published books wherein he goes into many curious details of his strange life .

		Somewhat different from all these is the following account of his not very studious days at the gi-eat
Friedrich Wilhelm Universitat	PERSON	: '' I may not have got much from the lectures , but I came in contact with such men as
Virchow	LOCATION	, the patholo - gist ;
Kiepert	LOCATION	, the geographer ;
Curtius	PERSON	, the Greek his - torian ; Plieiderer , the theologian ;
Helmholtz	PERSON	, the chem - ist -LSB- sic ' -RSB- , and I got glimpses of
Mommsen	PERSON	.

		He was not reading in the university during my stay in
Berlin	LOCATION	, but he lived not far from my mother 's home , and I used to see him in the street cars .

		He was a very much shriveled-up looking individual , and when sitting down looi < ed very diminutive .

		He wore immense glasses , which gave his eyes an owlish appearance ; I saw him to the best advantage one afternoon when we were rid - ing alone in a street car through the Thiergarten .

		He had a corner in the front , and 1 had taken one in the rear .

		I hardly noticed him at first , and had opened a book to read , when suddenly the old gentleman began to mumble to himself and gesture . '

		Ya , ya , so ist es , ' I could hear him say . '

		So muss es sein , ' and he flour - ished his right hand about as if he were speaking to a collection of Roman senators .

		What it was that was ' so , ' and why it had to be * so , ' I could not find out . ''

		An excerpt from
Flynt	PERSON	's memories of
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	will not be out of place . ''

		Now , that I look back over the experience and recall the old gentleman 's willingness to talk on any subject , I regret exceedingly that I did not quiz him about literary contemporaries and affairs .

		The principal thing he said along these lines that comes to my mind now concerned poetry and how it impressed him .

		We were sittmg in the music room , and some one had said something about the relative values of prose and poetry as methods of expression .

		Tolstoy preferred prose . '' '

		Poetry , ' he said , pointing to the parquet floor , ' reminds me of a man trying to walk zigzag across the room on those squares .

		It twists and turns in all direc - tions before it can arrive anywhere .

		Prose , on the other hand , is direct ; it goes straight at the mark . ' ''

		Talking about
America	LOCATION	and Americans , one after - noon , he was much interested in
William Dean Howells	LOCATION	,
Henry George	ORGANIZATION	, and the late
Henry Demarest Lloyd	ORGANIZATION	.

		He told me that there were four men in the world that he was very anxious to bring together ; he believed that a conference between them would throw much light on the world 's needs .

		Two of them , if my memory is cor - rect , were Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	. ''


Josiah Flynt	PERSON	-- like his father before him , but without reaching by four years his father 's age of forty-two -- drank himself to death .

		Pneumonia was the immediate cause of his de - mise , on the twentieth day of
January , 1907	DATE	, within three days of his thirty-eighth birthday .

		A few words descriptive of the man from those who knew him and were attached to him will be of interest .

		In some supplementary remin - iscences appended to
Flynt	PERSON	's unfinished auto - biography we read , from the pen of
Alfred Hodder	PERSON	, who himself died a few weeks after his friend : '' What first struck me was his prodigality in talk .

		He scattered treasures of anecdote and observation as Aladdin of the wonderful lamp orders his slave to scatter gold pieces .

		The trait is not common amongst men of letters ; they are the worst company in the world ; they are taking , not giving ; if they have not a notebook and pencil brutally before you in their hands , they have a notebook and pencil agilely at work in their heads ...
Flynt	PERSON	had no safe-deposit box for his good stories , and no gift for silence ; the anecdotes in his books are amazing ; the details of just how he got them are still more amazing ; he never learned to use up his material , to economize , and he was more amazing than his material .

		`` At the moment the point I wish to make is that
Flynt	PERSON	knew his vagrant in the open .

		He had a pro- found contempt for the books written by frock-coated gentlemen who have academic positions , and say ' sociol - ogy , ' and measure the skulls and take the confessions of the vagrant in captivity .

		Skull for skull he believed there was small difference between that of the first scamp and the first minister of the Gospel .

		I set that down for what it is worth as his opinion .

		The confes - sions of a vagrant in captivity are always , he said , false .

		This I fancy is almost true . ''

		Another who knew him well said of his literary ability that '' he knew and understood the ways of men , but when he wrote for publication his imagination seemed chained to earth .

		It may be he was too much ' on the inside ' to get his subject in perspective .

		Then , too , it must be remembered that
Flynt	PERSON	was the tramp writing , not the literary man tramping . ''

		This lack of the literary instinct plainly ap - pears in his book .

		Especially in the scraps of German and French that he is fond of introduc - ing , he shows himself no careful scribe .

		But his narrative is all the more characteristic from its lack of polish .

		Like all that he has written , it is extremely interesting , even though far less interesting than his talk is said to have been .

		The portraits of himself and of some of his near kindred enhance the interest ; and the brief introduction by his literary friend , Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	, helps one to a better acquaint - ance with this attractive vagabond .

Nov. 16	DATE	, Modern Painting ,
Chiefi	LOCATION	, y British .

		* The title of Mr.
Phythian	PERSON	's '' Fifty Years of Modern Painting '' is misleading and untrue as an indication of what the book really is . ''

		Modern Painting '' is not English painting alone .

		Corot was a Frenchman , and
Sargent	ORGANIZATION	is an American .

		Fifty years of modern painting , from the Frenchman to the American , would imply almost anything rather than a practically exclusive consideration of British art .

		It is not until the fifth chapter , which is nearly half way through the book , that the reader is apprised of the author 's real intention .

		In the opening of this chapter , we are told that the book was written '' primarily for English readers ; and emphasis is laid upon English , or , to use the more comprehensive word so much insisted upon nowadays , British art . ''

		It is quite natural to ask at this point , '' Why did you not say so before ? ''

		It would have saved the critic much trouble , for he would not then have looked for any thorough description of modern art during the years since
1850	DATE	, but only for an attempted estimate of the part the British painters played in this art development of half a century .

		With some disappointment , because of labor wasted under a misconception of the real object of the book , the critic , after this midway ex - planation , turns the pages back and seeks to estimate the value of the criticism of British art from the author 's own point of view .

		There is no doubt that here is a rather tolerant criticism of the faults and vagaries of the Pre-Raphaelite school , to which the author devotes a good deal of space .

		In fact , it is only a criticism so far as must be , because the author 's evident admi - ration of the painters of this school inclines him to eulogy rather than criticism .

		Yet he seems striving to resist this tendency , and will even admit that
Holman Hunt	PERSON	is a little hard in color and deals too much in detail ; that
Rossetti	PERSON	is not a perfect draughtsman , or even colorist ; and that even Burne-Jones painted not realities but types .

		Of
Millais	PERSON	, who turned back from the faith and sought quite another kind of truth from that known to
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, he does not wholly approve .

		Like
Ruskin	PERSON	, he calls the attempted fidelity to minute detail , as shown in the Pre-Raphaelite work , `` truth to Nature . ''

		It has long been known that such painting is very far from being true to

		not even interpret her works intelligibly .

		A picture that needs a long explanation in a catalogue has obviously failed to express any special truth .

		Such is the case with Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	's '' Flight into
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		A proper contrast with the great French masters is absolutely needed here to throw a true light upon the painting of the last fifty years .

		Also the greater American painters must be considered .

		Mr.
Phythian	PERSON	claims that Constable was the real founder of the modem French school of landscape painting .

		This is of course a matter about which there is much question .

		Boning - ton is also thought to have influenced the great Frenchmen , and some claim that the inspiration of the Barbizon school came from
Holland	LOCATION	.

		But whether from
England	LOCATION	or
Holland	LOCATION	, or , as seems more likely , from their own selves , the results of their work stand preeminent in modern land - scape painting .

		Where are the English pictures that can be compared with Millet 's '' Angelus , '' `` The Sower , '' '' The Gleaners '' ; or with
Rous	PERSON	- seau 's '' Le Givre , '' and scenes in the
Fontaine	PERSON	- bleau forest , especially at sunset ; or with
Corot	LOCATION	's '' Evening Star '' or ''
San Sebastian	LOCATION	'' ; or with many of the wonderful works of Dupr ^ and
Diaz	PERSON	, and of Troyon , whose cattle-pieces even the greatest of the Dutchmen have hardly excelled ?

		No matter if the author is , as he says , writing `` primarily for English readers , '' he should seek to tell them the truth , and avoid prejudice of any kind .

		Such a work should contain proper estimates of
Whistler	LOCATION	and of
Sargent	LOCATION	; but it does not , although the latter 's name appears in the title of the book , and his work has won him almost the foremost place in the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	in recent years .

		The French believe that
Whistler	LOCATION	was one of the greatest artists that ever lived .

		His portrait of his mother is thought by them to be one of the gems of the
Louvre	LOCATION	where it now hangs .

		In etching he is second only to
Rembrandt	LOCATION	, if he really is in - ferior to the great Dutch master .

		Melchers should surely be mentioned , for there is hardly a great g-allery in
Europe	LOCATION	that has not at least one of his pictures .


Cazin	LOCATION	, one of the greatest of modern painters of landscape , should be described and his work contrasted with that of the Englishmen .

		Such deficiencies ought not to occur even in a book having the tardily confessed purpose of treating primarily of En - glish art .

		The style and spirit of the first part of the work differ radically from the manner of the latter part .

		The discussion of the Pre -
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 341 Raphaelites is interesting , and at times broad and discriminating .

		The appreciation of
Watts	LOCATION	is excellent .

		These discussions are carried on at considerable length , and show faithful study and true understanding of the subject-matter .

		In the latter part of the book , which deals mostly with the art of other countries , the method adopted is very like that of a catalogue , and there is but little attempt at serious criti - cism .

		This is a great disappointment , because the writer 's critical power is very unusual , and his acquaintance with pictures is noteworthy .

		A really great critical work could have been hoped for from the first part of the book , but the promise is not fulfilled .

		It would almost seem as if the two parts had been written at different times and put together without any proper relation to each other .

		It is true that English art has made great progress in the last few years , and that is because it has become more liberal and has pro- fited by study in
France	LOCATION	and other
Continental	ORGANIZATION	countries .

		Insular prejudice has ceased to exist , or at least to .

		dominate as it once did .

		England to-day is open to the art of all the nations , and should seek to become one in the great brotherhood of artists whose hands are clasped around the world .

		* '' A tradition may be established about a man of lasting genius , but the final word can never be said . ''

		It is with this apologetic sentiment that Professor

John Keats	PERSON	.

		The words are true , -- for each generation , with fresh material discovered or with shifting viewpoint , has its utterance to express , its comment to add ; and , furthermore , the new generation is inter - ested in the new word if it be spoken with intel - ligence and weight .

		Thus it will be with
Keats	PERSON	.

		It is not only the pathos of his story that keeps his memory alive ; there is the wonder that from such humble origin such an ardent worshipper of Beauty shoidd be born , and again the larger wonder that under the stern conditions of this brief life such absolute distinction and such worth should characterize its fruit .

		It is an appreciation of

		Is our biographer trying to write like

		The hand is Esau 's , but the voice is
Jacob 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		One thing worth while Mr.
Hancock	PERSON	does at the start in contradicting the strange statement of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, that '' no poet save Shakespeare himself is more English than
Keats	PERSON	. ''

		It is the universality of
Keats	PERSON	, the remoteness of his inspiration from the immediate interests of his age and land , that constitutes his chief distinc - tion among his contemporary poets .

		Elsewhere the essayist does good service also in correctly interpreting a certain utterance of the poet which has often been twisted to the disparage - ment of Keats .

		Once he discussed in a letter '' The two methods of attaining truth , the intuitive and the rational .

		In the midst of his argument he sud - denly broke out , ' Oh , for a life of sensations rather than thoughts ! '

		And the exclamation , interpreted by its context , simply meant , ' I should rather live in the emotions of the heart , stirred by the imagination 's con - ception of beauty , than in the intellectual truth gained from the processes of logic ! '

		It is the impetuous cry of the poet for the intuitive perceptions of the higher nature . '' '

		Do not all charms fly At the mere touch of cold Philosophy ? ' ''

		It is a very sane portraiture of
Keats	PERSON	, after all , that the author gives us in this book , -- thoroughly human , despite the fact that for us of to-day the poet 's figure is '' set in a mystical haze , luminous in the flooding light of his fame . ''

		Keats was a normal youth , -- '' A man 's man wholly .

		He loved to smoke .

		He drank wine with relish ; sometimes until he was ' pleas - antly tipsy . '

		... He enjoyed rough sports .

		He went to a bear-baiting .

		He saw the prize-fight between
Randall	PERSON	and
Turner	ORGANIZATION	.

		And he fought a man himself for some act of brutality ... He was talkative , bril - liant , when the talk was to his liking ; when it was not , he sat silent .

		In the intimate circle the window seat was reserved for
Keats	PERSON	.

		There we may best fix a pic - ture of him in the characteristic attitude of one foot on the other knee and the hand clasping the instep ... Broad shovdders , depth of chest suggest the stature of a larger man .

		The full face , as he turns to speak , shows the distinction and the conscious - ness of the high calling .

		The hazel eyes glow with some inward light as his words issue in a low musical voice .

		There is self-assurance in his modesty ; at times he is petulant , fiercely assertive . ''

		The interpretative portion of Professor Han - cock 's work , however , is the noteworthy feature of his book .

		Some twenty-five pages are devoted to the analysis of '' Endymion , '' a study which is thorough and suggestive , and corrects a fre - quent misinterpretation of
Keats	PERSON	's utterances on Beauty and Truth .

		The essayist accepts without dispute the dictum that as a poem '' Endymion '' must be reckoned a failure . ''

		Isabella , '' '' Lamia , '' '' The Eve of St.
Agnes	PERSON	, '' the Odes , and '' Hyperion '' receive like careful criticism .

		The immediate success of '' Hype - rion , '' the turn in the tide of contemporary criticism which now began to set toward
Keats	PERSON	, our author attributes to the virility of the uncompleted poem -- a quality not found in the earlier work . ''

		There is in `` Hyperion ' a rousing masculinity .

		It vibrates with mass power in action .

		Keats 's principle of beauty in repose has been liberated into the beauty of dynamic energies . ''

		In the closing chapters which deal with the pathetic picture of the poet 's last days in
Rome	LOCATION	, the biographer pays just tribute to the perfect devotion of Severn .

		Among the classics of masculine friendship there is none more gra - cious and tender than this .

		It is pleasant to remember that there was no rancor in the mind of the dying poet , no rage , no bitterness remaining from the savage person - alities of the reviews .

		There was only one critic whose judgment had depressed him -- and that critic was himseK .

		`` If I should die , I have left no immortal work behind me -- nothing to make my friends proud of my memory , but I have loved the principle of Beauty in all things , and if I had had time I would have made myself re - membered . ''

		Thus had he wi-itten a few months before his death .

		There is no question of his sincerity ; and it was not affectation that dictated the melancholy epitaph , '' Here lies one whose name was writ in water . ''

		Yet he it is , --
John Keats	PERSON	, whose first poetic preludings began under the influence of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's melodious verse , -- he it is who in due time becomes the poet 's poet of a later generation and the messenger in English verse of a distinct and beneficent evangel : '' Beauty is Truth ,
Truth Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, -- that is all Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know . ''

		The pleasantest thing that we can say of Professor
Hancock	PERSON	's book is this : the reader will not get very far in the volume before he takes his copy of the poet from the shelf and falls again under its spell .

		Truly , '' A thing of beauty is a joy forever : Its loveliness increases ; it will never Pass into nothingness ; but still will keep A bower quiet for us , and a sleep Full of sweet dreams , and health .

		... '' The publishers deserve a word of grateful recognition for having given us a beautiful book , handsomely printed , richly illustrated , and care - fully indexed .

		It will be appreciated by all admirers of the poet .

		* In his latest volume of essays , Mr.
Benson	PERSON	invites us to a new point of view .

		Leaving that pleasant college window through which we have been shown such charming vistas , we ac - company him to his country home in vacation time ; we see some delightful old church towers , a slow winding river , quaint lanes and peaceful farms ; between our walks , our reading , and our long leisurely reveries , Mr.
Benson	PERSON	chats with us so informally that we almost fail to observe that he is covering a wide range of abstract subjects and is probing each to profound depths .

		Contentment and friendship , humor , shyness and the dramatic sense , specialism and our lack of great men , optimism and equality , joy and the love of God : we have heard Mr.
Benson	PERSON	discuss some of these matters in one or another of the various conversations we have had with him before , but he succeeds , nevertheless , in im - pressing us with the fact that they are many - sided , and that at college in term time we could not quite see them from the viewpoint we have in these holidays in the country .

		If we find our host no less serious when he touches upon questions of deep import than he was wont to be , we yet have the satisfaction of chuckling with him delightedly on occasion .

		His logic is as keen , his irony as delicate , as ever ; the flow - ing cadences of his style woo us like quiet music ; and always we are conscious that our two chairs are quite close together , and that Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has a very friendly and companionable arm thrown lightly around our shoulders .

Hallam	PERSON	and the
Henley	LOCATION	, or the
Gladstone	PERSON	or the
Cardinal Manning	ORGANIZATION	, that we find sketched in a moment merely to point a moral or adorn the tale .

		Again , as we read , we find a paragraph of criticism so subtle in its analysis that we wish Mr.
Benson	PERSON	had used a more generous share of his pages to such purpose .

		Reading on , we come upon word-pictures of landscape -- such combinations of copse and meadow , sky and river , ancient wall and familiar farmyard , described with apprehension so acute and appreciation so sincere that we long for a book in which Mr.
Benson	PERSON	shall describe every nook and corner of the
England	LOCATION	he knows so well and loves so earnestly with the same visual - izing power that characterizes the chapter on Kelmscott and
William Morris	PERSON	in the present volume .

		Descriptions of scenery are usually dreary enough , but Mr.
Benson	PERSON	fairly makes us see and feel the glory of piled-up clouds and the golden glow of a sunset that faded months ago .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	would have us believe that a new medium of utterance is yet to be discovered by some fortunate artist in letters -- a medium which shall obviate the '' clumsy necessity of sacrificing the sequence of thought to the bar - barous devices of metre and rhyme , or to the still more childish devices of incident and drama . ''

		He reminds us that
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	anticipated a time when the writer would require no subject , but would express emotion and thought directly rather than pictorially .

		Readers of '' The Altar Fire '' and '' Beside Still Waters '' will readily understand that in those books Mr.
Benson	PERSON	himself sought to approach this medium of expression .

		To select from these rich pages a few illus - trative passages is a task beyond the present reviewer ; yet custom almost demands that such a selection shall be made .

		The rare beauty of our author 's style is shown in the following , from the essay on Friendship : '' `` To make oneself beloved , ' says an old French proverb , ' this is , after all , the best way to be useful . '

		That is one of the deep sayings which children think flat , and which young men , and even young women , despise ; and which a middle-aged man hears with a certain troubled surprise , and wonders if there is not something in it after all ; and which old people discover to be true , and think with a sad regret of opportunities missed , and of years devoted , how unprofitably , to other kinds of usefulness !

		The truth is that most of us who have any ambitions at all do not start in life with a hope of being useful , but rather with an intention of being ornamental .

		We think , like
Joseph	PERSON	in his childish dreams , that the sun and moon and the eleven stars , to say nothing of the sheaves , are going to make obeisance to us .

		We want to be impressive , rich , beau - tiful , influential , admired , envied ; and then , as we move forward , the visions fade .

		We have to be content if , in a quiet corner , a single sheaf gives us a nod of recogni - tion ; and as for the eleven stars , they seem unaware of oui '' very existence !

		And then we make further dis - coveries : that when we have seemed to ourselves most impressive we have only been pretentious ; that riches are only a talisman against poverty , and even make suffering and pain and grief more unendurable ; that beauty fades into stolidity or weariness ; that influence comes mostly to people who do not pursue it , and that the best kind of influence belongs to those who do not even know that they possess it ; that admiration is but a brilUaut husk ; which may or may not contain a wholesome kernel ; and as for envy , there is poison in that cup !

		And then we become aware that the best crowns have fallen to those who have not sought them , and that simple-minded and unselfish people have won the prize which has been denied to brilliance and am - bition . ''

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	is rarely epigrammatic ; yet some of his best thoughts are expressed compactly enough almost to pass as epigrams .

		Here are a few such sentences selected almost at random : '' It has got to be proved that one was sent into the world to be efPective . '' ''

		Life , which ought to be spent partly in gathering materials , and partly in drawing inferences , is apt to be a hurried accumulation lasting to the edge of the tomb . '' ''

		The real pleasures of the world are those which can - not be bought for money , and which are wholly independ - ent of success . '' ''

		An age which values notoriety above everything except property . '' ''

		To acquiesce in appearing ridiculous is the height of philosophy . '' ''

		No one can become great by taking thought , and still less by desiring greatness .

		It is not an attainable thing ; fame only is attainable . '' ''

		The poet and the idealist make and cast abroad the great vital ideas which the specialist picks up and ana - lyzes . '' ''

		We tend at the present time to honor achievements when they have begun to grow a little mouldy . '' ''

		There are two modes and methods of being great ; one is by largeness , the other by intensity . ''

		It is pleasant to think that Mr.
Benson	PERSON	has upwards of thirty volumes to his credit -- pleas - ant indeed in these days of feverish fiction , these days when the literary taste of so many of one 's acquaintances is varied only by distinct prefer - ences as to which of the Ten Commandments shall be violated , in detail , in the books they read ; it is pleasant , and hopeful too , to think that a cordial welcome always awaits these quiet books , gently conceived and unobtrusively put forth from the ivy-covered quadrangles of an old

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, The Making of a Great Poem .

		* Nineteenth-century criticism took upon itself the special mission of examining into the sources of great masterpieces , in order to discover , if possible , the artist at work upon his materials .

		Shakespeare 's source-books , those of Chaucer ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and others , were made the subjects of many studies .

		Although these in no sense did , nor ever can , fathom or explain the element of personal power in creat - ive art , they did at least serve to differentiate the special power of each artist , and make more evident the Miltonic , the Chaucerian , the Shake - spearian touch .

		Such a criticism is well worth while .

		Many a secret of personality thus dis - closes itseK ; from the contemplation of many artists at work , there may be hopes of an event - ual philosophy of creative art , distant as it now seems .

		That the twentieth century is likely to find congeniality in the same labors , seems quite evi - dent .

		An important indication of it is the publication of a large quarto volume of 350 pages devoted to the consideration of the '' square old yellow book '' now in the library of
Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	, from which
Browning	PERSON	derived the inspiration for his greatest and longest work , '' The Ring and the Book . ''

		Readers of that poem do not need to be told of the chance man - ner in which
Browning	PERSON	bought the volume at the old bookstall in the
Piazza of San Lorenzo	LOCATION	; how it lay hold upon him from the first glance ; how he read it , threading the narrow
Floren	PERSON	- tine streets in his mechanical walk homeward ; how he laid it not down imtil finished to the very end ; and how stepping out on the terrace he saw the whole piece act itself over again in his imagination , and in the exhilaration of creat - ive joy felt that '' A spirit laughs and leaps through every limb , And lights my eye and lifts me by the hair , Letting me have my will again with these . ''

		Surely , no poet could well give a more circum - stantial or confidential account of the birth - moment of his own creation .

		The external facts are all there ; the visitor in
Florence	LOCATION	even hunts out the veritable bookstall -LRB- looking to-day just as
Browning	PERSON	describes it -RRB- with a half-hope that the same miracle may happen to himself .

		But the inner mystery remains , as remain it must , because art is something so much more than any mere facts , because the mystic power • Tne Old Yellow Book .

		we call genius is in the last resort forever unex - plainable -- '' the finger of God , the flash of the will that can . ''

		Nevertheless , there are certain questions we may ask with some hope of a reply , and in these source-studies may help us : How far does the artist 's raw material control or master his creative activity ?

		What is the difference between the material and the final product ?

		What personal equation in the artist effected this change ?

		Such questions find response in the monu - mental work of Mr.
Charles W. Hodell	PERSON	.

		To secure the scholarly world against the possible destruction of the unique copy of the '' Old Yellow Book '' at
Balliol	LOCATION	, it is here reproduced , page for page , by photographic process .

		Its text being a mixture of bad Latin and vernacu - lar Italian , Mr.
Hodell	PERSON	makes it available to the average reader by his own translation ; then follows a fascinating essay of comparison between the source and the art-product , the whole being concluded by topical notes , 641 in number , the result of much scholarly and painstaking re - search .

		A story more sordid , more cruel , more bar - barous , than that of the '' Old Yellow Book , '' it would be difficidt to conceive .

		Indeed , the work was not a published volume at all , but rather a lawyer 's file of documents and pamph - lets bearing on a certain murder trial that took place in
Rome	LOCATION	in the year
1698	DATE	.

		Their collec - tor was a lawyer who had merely a professional interest in the material ; for him , it was simply a noteworthy precedent as to `` whether and when a husband may kUl his adulterous wife without incurring the ordinary penalty '' for murder .

		The human or ethical side of the tragedy made no appeal to this man .

		The file when completed was part of his law library , but not any part of his personal history .

		He bound it with a vellum cover for preservation , and it is this age-yeUow veUum that suggested the poet 's name , '' The Old Yellow Book . ''

		During the `` decades thrice five , '' from the time the volume first began gathering dust in the
Floren	PERSON	- tine lawyer 's library until it feU into the poet 's hands at the bookstall , its history is a blank .

		To a modern reader , nothing can be duller than this volume , -- and , one would suppose , nothing could be more forbidding to an artist .

		The rights and wrongs of the case have apparently small interest to the lawyers ; to them , it is just a job on which to employ their professional cunning .

		Their casuistry and sophistry are utterly divorced from such human sentiment as might naturally arise .

		Pity for the wife ,
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 346 sympathy for the husband , admiration or repro - bation for the priest -- such natural feelings as we should expect to spring spontaneously from contact with this tragedy -- are nowhere to be found in the book .

		Wherever there is a show of sentiment , its rhetorical parade betrays its insincerity .


Browning	PERSON	's comparison of himself to
Elisha	LOCATION	in making the dead alive again , is not extreme .

		Truly , he had to breathe mightily on these dry bones before these men and women of a former day could stand erect , not only to play over again their parts in that long-forgotten tragedy , but also to tell through their own speech and in their own way the causes and motives that lay behind these acts .

		For that , after all , is the significant matter not only of '' The Ring and the Book '' but of all
Browning	PERSON	's writing .

		He was a searcher of human hearts .

		No man , not even the worst criminal , failed to arouse his interest and to stir him to find out the underlying motives .

		What do these bad hearts mean ?

		What place have they in God 's world ?

		How can the all - powerful and all-loving Father permit his chil - dren to plunge into such an abyss of evil ?

		The story of
Guido Franceschini	PERSON	's brutal greed , this dark record of crime , appealed to
Browning	PERSON	, not for its sentimentalism but for its profound spiritual meaning .

		And
Francesca Pompilia Comparini	PERSON	!

		The lawyers allude to her as a '' wretched child , '' an '' unfortunate girl '' ; they are solely intent on their technical pleading , and her pathetic story does not wring from them the slightest drop of human pity .

		But
Browning	PERSON	read between the lines the story of a child-mother wi'onged -- the story of a suffering woman , cruelly tormented by a husband who is backed by the whole structure of conventional society .


Browning	PERSON	, on being congratulated for his wonderful creation of
Pompilia	LOCATION	, replied : '' I assure you that I found her in the book just as she speaks in my poem . ''

		But without
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's peculiar genius , can anyone else find her there ?

		As a matter of fact ,
Pompilia	ORGANIZATION	's own affidavit shows simplicity and innocent suffer - ing , but gives no hint of her more striking aspects of character .

		It has no word concern - ing her faith in God , her thought of her child , her personal feeling toward Caponsacchi -- all those traits that win us to her as we are won by few heroines in poetry .

		Almost the sole fact - basis for
Browning	PERSON	's conception of her char - acter lies in the sworn testimony of Fra Celestino and his associates who were the spiritual guides of her last moments .

		Those men of long expe - rience who surrounded her death-bed were deeply moved by her innocence , by her tender forgive - ness of those who had wronged her , and by her faith in God .

		From such hints as these , the alembic of
Browning	PERSON	's imagination created one of the most masterly portraits of the suffering saint in all literature .

		Quite the same is it in dealing with the third person of this .

		central group --
Caponsacchi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again
Browning	PERSON	jjrobes far below the surface .

		The real
Caponsacchi	ORGANIZATION	's relation to
Pompilia	LOCATION	was limited almost entirely to the crisis of her trouble ; his own affidavit has a manly ring , but does not rise to any heroic pitch ; we have no evidence that his flight with
Pompilia	PERSON	is any - thing more than a superficial adventure .

		Now ,
Browning	PERSON	was a great believer in epochal crises , supreme moments in life , and he realized that something of this kind might have hap - pened , converting the `` fribble , fop and cox - comb '' into a hero .

		Something in the look of the lady , '' young , tall , beautiful , strange and sad , '' was a call to
Caponsacchi	ORGANIZATION	's nobler self .

		A spiritual revolution took place .

		Pompilia became to him a revelation of God dwelling in woman as purity , long-suffering , godliness -- an embodied
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, Our Lady of Sorrows .

		She challenged his worship in the most pro- found religious sense , rather than in the con - ventional sentimental hyperbole of romantic poetry ; when the call of duty came he was ready , a soldier-saint , a true Christian hero , the most interesting of
Browning	PERSON	's pictures of noble manhood .

		In the opportunity to make such comparisons as these appears the great significance of this source-study .

		We are presented with a mass of documents which to the ordinary sight is merely a chaos of charge and counter-charge between some commonplace persons in whom it is impossible to feel any particular interest .

		The poet took them out of this chaos , raised them into the province of art , vitalized and ideal - ized their characters , till , laying aside their commonplaceness , they stand for the poet 's master-conceptions of human nature , his atti - tude toward conventional society , his faith in God .

		And so , beholding the Book as the poet found it , and the Ring as the poet left it , we realize more fully than ever that
Robert Brown	PERSON	- ing was not only one of the greatest creative artists of our time , but of all time .

		Oreat campaigns The thii 'd volume of Prof essor
Oman	LOCATION	's of the Spanish '' History of the Peninsular War '' Peninsula .

		-LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- continues a work al - ready recognized as one of great importance to stu - dents of military history .

		For the average reader , the care and minuteness of this study may seem for - bidding .

		The author , however , would doubtless dis - claim an ambition to attract the general reader , look - ing rather to the student for appreciation of his work .

		What he has done is to give with minute exactness , and in orderly arrangement , all of the old material bearing upon this war , together with such new facts as he has discovered in his profound study of the topic .

		Mr.
Oman	PERSON	is one of the few men engaged as a teacher of history who has exact military details at his fingers ' ends .

		Added to this , he has perfect knowledge of the topography of
Portugal	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, so that his descriptions of battles and campaigns are rendered more lucid than the accounts ordinarily given to military manoeuvres .

		This third volume of 586 pages covers the sixteen months from
Septem	LOCATION	- ber
1809	DATE	to
December 1810	DATE	, and its main interest centres in the campaign of
Massena	LOCATION	-- a campaign which Mr.
Oman	PERSON	himself regards as the real crisis of the entire Peninsular War .

		In that campaign the dramatic feature is , of course , the approach of
Massena	LOCATION	to
Wellington	LOCATION	's lines at
Torres Vedras	ORGANIZATION	.

		The magnificent energy displayed in creating the defensive fortifications known as the Lines of Torres Vedras resulted , according to the author , in a series of apparently isolated yet really interdependent forts , so arranged as to render practically impossible any successful attack by the French save with an overpowering force ; but Mr.
Oman	PERSON	shows that it was not upon the fortifications alone that Welling - ton depended for a successful defense .

		The defen - sive scheme was a three-fold arrangement , scientifi - cally planned and carefully executed .

		The fortifi - cations were an important part ; but in addition
Massena	LOCATION	's advance was to be harassed and checked by irregular cavalry or infantry pressure from either side , and his communications threatened .

		And a third essential element to a successful issue had been assured in the organized devastation of the country long before the French troops were within striking distance of
Wellington	LOCATION	's main army .

		The Lines of Torres Vedras were sufficient to check
Massena	LOCATION	's advance ; but in order that
Massena	LOCATION	might be forced to retire , and that
Portugal	LOCATION	might be freed from the presence of an enemy , the devastation of crops and the threatened cutting of communications were equally necessary .

		The general account here given of this and similar military movements follows very much that given by
Napier	PERSON	in his historic work , and in few instances does Mr.
Oman	PERSON	really criticise the results of
Napier	ORGANIZATION	's research .

		Nevertheless , the pres - ent work is infinitely more accurate in minor detail than that of
Napier	PERSON	, and it must also be said that for one interested in military history written on so large a scale Mr.
Oman	PERSON	's work is distinctly more readable .

		His method of presentation , like his study , is leis - urely , leaving the impression of a disinclination to close the account of any particular incident or cam - paign .

		The present volume , like its predecessors , contains many excellent battle-plans , and has in addition a relatively unknown engraving of the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	in
1813	DATE	, from a portrait in the Hope Collection .

		While the writings of
Miss Helen	ORGANIZATION	andher world .

		J ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ' inevitably acquire a peculiar interest from the limitations of sense in which the author lives , they equally merit atten - tion by reason of their intrinsic worth .

		True , in read - ing one never gets far away from the pro ` scriptions of her world , and particularly so long as she is en - engaged in portraying to us what kind of a world it is .

		Miss
Keller	PERSON	tells us that `` The World I Live In '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not wholly the theme of her choosing . ''

		Every book is in a sense autobiograph - ical .

		But while other self-recording creatures are permitted at least to seem to change the subject , apparently nobody cares what I think of the tariff , the conservation of our natural resources , or the conflicts which revolve about the name of
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	.

		If I offer to reform the educational system of the world , my editorial friends say , ' That is interesting .

		But will you please tell us what idea you had of goodness and beauty when you were six years old ? '

		First they ask me to tell the life of the child who is mother to the woman .

		Then they make me my own daughter and ask for an account of grown-up sensa - tions .

		Finally , I am requested to write about my dreams , and thus I become an anachronical grand - mother ; for it is the special privilege of old age to relate dreams . ''

		At all events , this theme she has securely to herself .

		Miss
Keller	PERSON	manages to sketch very vividly the character of the impressions , the many derivative indications of who 's who and what 's what , that come hinted and wafted to her alert senses made keen and appreciative by what is of most worth -- mental impressionability and an appreciative imag - ination .

		Yet , after all , from our point of view , it is a gleaner 's task .

		There is a harvest and enough to sustain an active mind in active health ; but the full richness and freedom of the wide outlook , the gener - ous and easy intercourse , are but meagrely replaced .

		And what replaces it is a possession much to be cher - ished -- that of an imaginative literary sense .

		Miss
Keller	PERSON	argues valiantly for the reality of her impres - sions , for the metaphorical significance of much that the seeing and hearing enjoy , for her right -LRB- readily conceded -RRB- to use the language of mankind , and for the comparability of her world to that in which the sun shines , color beautifies , and sounds make joyous and human .

		But the psychological reader remains unconvinced .

		Here , as elsewhere , it is all a matter of proportion .

		Doubtless language is saturated with derived , implied , and transferred meanings of things , and our intercourse is carried on in these counters without too much reference to their face value ; yet their use is fashioned upon the experience of their
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 origin , and '' a primrose by a river 's brim '' is a very different thing to him who has seen it , however much for the purposes of a mood it would be equally effec - tive for
Wordsworth	PERSON	or Miss
Keller	PERSON	.

		All of which is intended to send the reader directly to Miss
Keller	PERSON	's most interesting book , which , though it concludes with a metrical '' Chant of Darkness , '' will be found to emanate much sweetness and light .

		The reiipion ^ ^ - ^ ' ^ ' Wells 's attitude toward and philosophy many matters of universal interest of an agnostic , jg already known to readers of his `` Modern Utopia , '' `` Mankind in the Making , '' '' Anticipations , '' and other sociological essays .

		In his latest book , '' First and Last Things '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which he calls also '' A Confession of Faith and a Rule of Life , '' he states his philosophical and reli - gious beliefs , so far as his avowedly agnostic lean - ings permit him to have any .

		All knowledge , he points out , is more or less vague , and even science is far from strictly accurate .

		No trimmed and rounded system of philosophy or religion is attain - able .

		We make our beliefs as we go along ; at least Mr.
Wells	PERSON	does . ''

		I make my beliefs as I want them , '' he declares . ''

		I do not attempt to go to facts for them .

		I make them thus and not thus , exactly as an artist makes a picture so and not so .

		... My belief in them rests upon the fact that they work for me and satisfy a desire for harmony and beauty . ''

		Thus he shows himself to be essen - tially a '' pragmatist , '' though he does not use the word .

		He is also , as might be proved by quotations , a good deal of a mystic , cherishing an unreasoning faith in '' the ultimate rightness and significance of things '' ; somewhat inclined to
Cyrenaicism	LOCATION	, paying homage to Beauty -LRB- with a capital B -RRB- as '' something in me which demands not simply gratification but the best and keenest of a sense or continuance of sense impressions , and which refuses coarse quanti - tative assuagements '' ; unable to believe in a personal God and the immortality of the soul ; and contenting himself with making collective humanity the object of his deepest devotion , though he nowhere calls himself a follower of Comte . ''

		It seems to me , '' he says in unmistakable terms , '' that the whole living creation may be regarded as walking in the sleep of instinct and individualized illusion , and that now out of it all rises man , beginning to perceive his larger self , his universal brotherhood , and a collective syn - thetic purpose to realize power and beauty . ''

		And again , concerning `` the purpose in things , '' he de - clares : '' I have set down my broad impression of that purpose in respect to me , as the awakening and development of the consciousness and will of our species , and I have confessed my belief that in sub - ordinating myself and all my motives to that idea lies my Salvation . ''

		The last half of the book , treat - ing of '' General Conduct '' and '' Some Personal Things , '' applies the principles enunciated in the first half .

		Although Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's religion and phil - osophy may not be , and indeed can not be , exactly those of any one of his readers , the book is valuable as the honest attempt of a man of vigorous and wide-ranging intellect to explain precisely what he believes and what he disbelieves .

		He would also , if he had his way , have everyone else possess a similar courage .

		In his collection of ephemeral papers -LRB- he admits their ephemerality -RRB- entitled `` All Things Considered '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , he more than once condemns journalistic anonymity as the shelter of uncourageous and unstraightforward writers .

		No one can ever charge him with any such skulking behind an anonym or a pseudonym or an editorial '' we . ''

		Whatever he has to say he says boldly and unmistakably in the first person singular , and signs his name to it .

		Letting this latest book of his open itself at random , we find the pronoun of one letter occurring six times on the left-hand page and seven times on the right-hand .

		Another commendable utterance in the volume concerns phonetic spelling . ''

		Now my own fear , '' he tells us , '' touching any - thing in the way of phonetic spelling , is that it would simply increase this tendency to use words as counters and not as coins .

		The original life in a word -LRB- as in the word ' talent ' -RRB- burns low as it is : sensible spelling might extinguish it altogether ... If you spell a word wrong you have some tempta - tion to think it wrong . ''

		This and other praise of things genuine and uncorrupted is good .

		A man in whom simple truth is his utmost skill , we all admire .

		But Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's fondness for the startling and the paradoxical betrays him now and then into saying things that he can not mean .

		When he jauntily calls himself vulgar , he is either insincere or he attaches a meaning of his own to the adjective ; and when he light-heartedly assures us in his preface that he expects his book will turn out to be '' unintelligible gibberish , '' he is not rigorously honest with himself and his readers .

		If he really suspected himself of writing so much rubbish as his facility and his present popularity combine to make him guilty of , he would refrain from publishing his '' unintelligible gibberish , '' and he woiUd study to produce less , and that of a character more worthy of his genius .

		It only remains to say that `` AU Things Considered '' has , in its incoherence and scrappiness and in its unrelieved joltiness of style , the Chestertonic quality distilled to quintessential strength .

		-- -- In '' The Sense of the Infinite '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- StS ? '' '

		Mr.
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	throws light upon a phase of the subject of Mysticism which , though not new , has seldom been favored with such a clear illumination .

		And in view of the present marked interest in super-normal states , the book would appear to be of interest as a commentary on the chief historic examples of the highest types of such states .

		The heart of the subject is laid bare in the second chapter , where to the question '' What is the Sense of the Infinite ? ''

		the defini - 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, tion given is : '' That instinct or sense or feeling of the human soul by means of which it is drawn out of every day consciousness and brought into an elevated state of mind , by the contemplation or vision of those things which arouse within us a sense of timeless Being , of the Absolute , the Infinite , the One . ''

		And this state of mind , the author finds , comes always from the higher elements of the soul , it owns no kinship with the gross delirium of nar - cotism or inebriety , nor is it gained by selfish gratifi - cation , but ever by a spiritual reaching upward toward that which is not of oneself .

		The three '' Openings into the Infinite '' are , Nature , Roman - tic Love , and Religion ; and to these three the suc - ceeding chapters are devoted .

		As a disciple of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, the author , as might be expected , is most pleasing in his treatment of the second aditus .

		It is upon this type of mysticism that profane writei-s have cast the greatest abuse ; and the apologia sent forth by our author is inspiring in that it is not writ - ten in the lesser style of a polemic .

		To the reli - gious or ethical-philosophic aspect of Transcendent - alism , chapters five to ten are given , including the topics of Platonism , Neo-Platonism , Mediaeval Mys - ticism , the Reformation , and the
Pietist Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		From all the ages , exemplars are called to declare their witness to the truth of the Sense of the Infinite and to its abiding influence in the life of man .

		And it is this influence in the present that forms the sub - ject of the last chapter of the work ; for the Tran - scendant Vision is not of the past alone , but is eternal ; nor is it a memory only , but a potent inspir - ation from the Sense of the Infinite .

		In few popu - lar works of the present time has the essential spirituality of mystic exaltion been so consistently maintained .

		Miss
Eleanor Prescott Hammond	PERSON	has iKaZlrS : '' placed Chaucer students under large obligations to her for a very useful volume entitled '' Chaucer , a Bibliographical Man - ual '' -LRB- Macmillan -RRB- .

		Without including annotation of the Chaucerian text -LRB- except a few well-known cruces -RRB- , or allusions to Chaucer , or the lighter '' liter - ary '' essays , or '' third-hand '' biographies , she has nevertheless filled a volume of nearly six hundred pages with references , well digested abstracts , inde - pendent criticisms , and judiciously selected extracts dealing with all phases of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's life and works , as well as the works -LRB- in a group by themselves -RRB- which have been printed with
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's or attri - buted to him .

		The thoroughness of her work may be illustrated by the section on the ''
Canterbury Tales	ORGANIZATION	, '' which alone fills 175 pages , and includes elaborate descriptions -LRB- from personal observation -RRB- of most of the sixty odd manuscripts , with much detailed information regarding the individual tales , and long studies of their dates .

		Some of the matter in the Reference List , more - over , ^ e. g. , the rough lists of articles in

Englische Studien	PERSON	, and Modern Philology , -- seems superfluous ; how it can help the student is hard to see .

		A few reviews of books , especially those on the language of Chaucer , have been omitted ; some of these , of course , are not important .

		As far as we have tested the book , all the important works on Chaucer are noted in the proper places , and there are very few errors of citation or misprints .

		The index is good .

		As far as the author 's work is con - cerned , then , we have little but praise of the volume , which represents the labor of years .

Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr. h rederic
Harrison	PERSON	of a Potitivist .

		presents a fourth volume of his re - printed essays , all of them being based , despite their variety and diversity , '' on one coherent scheme of thought -- the Positivist Synthesis , -- a reorganiza - tion of life , at once intellectual , moral , and social , by faith in our common humanity . ''

		Not quite all , however , of the forty-five articles composing this latest volume are reprints .

		Three , on the present burning question of woman suffrage , have been prompted by recent public discussion and agitation .

		England has had ample opportunity of late to see furens quid femina possit , as Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	sadly admits ; and it is not surprising to find him vehe - mently opposed to any yielding to the demands of the `` suffragettes . ''

		But when he says of female sufffrage that '' the great Republics of
France	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	decline to risk their peace with any such anomalous fad , '' he forgets or ignores those States of our country that have , more or less completely , accorded the voting privilege to women .

		The first and longest essay in the volume , entitled ''
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, '' and advocating a systematic cooper - ation between the two countries as the key to peace and progress in
Europe	LOCATION	, was written in
1864	DATE	, and is now , after forty-four years , reissued in the season of European ententes to which Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	has never ceased to look forward .

		The second part of the book , embracing chapters on literature and art -- the first part being devoted to social and political questions -- is especially attractive .

		Noteworthy in aJl these volumes of writings covering half a century in time are the uniform literary excellence which they display .

		THE DIAL 349 work of arousing the national spirit and shaping events toward the realization of their hopes and aspirations .

		Perhaps the most remarkable of all is the gi'oup of leaders and heroes to whom modern
Italy	LOCATION	owes her existence , especially in the wide range of their abilities and the variety of their character - istics ,
Mazzini	PERSON	the Prophet , Cavour the Statesman ,
Garibaldi	PERSON	the Crusader , and
Victor Emmanuel the King	PERSON	, as they are often named , suggest at once the range of interest and activities of the group .

		These men , including the earlier patriots
Alfieri	PERSON	the Poet ,
Manzoni	PERSON	the Man of Letters , Gioberti the Philo - sopher , and
Manin	PERSON	the '' Father of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' are interestingly set before the readers of to-day by Mr.
Rupert Sargent Holland	PERSON	in a book entitled '' Build - ers of
United Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , It is well worth read - ing by all who admire brave deeds and heroic self - sacrifice .

		There is necessarily much repetition in the several sketches of the actors in the one series of events , but this detracts little from the interest , while it deepens the impressions of patriotic self - devotion shown by these great Italians .

		Young people especially should read the book .

		Needed reforms ^ ^ -
Parmelee	PERSON	has given us , in his in criminal work on '' The Principles of Anthro - procedure .

		pology and Sociology in their Rela - tions to Criminal Procedure '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- a very clear and reliable summary of the theories of criminology of the Italian School , and especially of
Lombroso	LOCATION	,
Garofalo	PERSON	, and
Ferri	PERSON	.

		He has not entirely ignored the studies of other modern writers , although he has scarcely done justice to American students in this field .

		The central idea of the book is the su - perior importance of procedure , as compared with the penal code , .

		He recommends the abolition of the lay jury except for political offences ; the appoint - ment of trained judges and prosecutors , both to be educated in criminology and sociology as well as in law ; the indeterminate sentence , with scientific study of the criminal at the trial and afterward , with a judi - cial board to revise the sentences periodically ; scien - tific methods of dealing with evidence , as suggested also by Professor
MUnsterberg	PERSON	; and the use of ex - perts employed by the state , and not representing private parties , during the trial .

		The discussion is in every way strong and clear , and deserves the care - ful study of all intelligent citizens .

		It will help the movement represented by many able lawyers to secure a wider outlook in social science in the edu - cational plans of law schools .

		Too often ancient prejudices have become intrenched in the minds of lawyers and judges because they had never studied in any laboratory but the law library .

		The period of mental virilitv - Dr.
Osier	PERSON	's thesis -- so generally misunderstood -- still finds a contro - versial echo in Mr.
W. A	PERSON	,
Newman Borland	ORGANIZATION	's brochure entitled `` The Age of Mental Virility '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The handling of the theme is light , indeed statistically quite inadequate ; but the gathering of data of first notable achieve - ments , of the period of the magnum optis , of the length of productive activity of the world 's great workers , does leave in its wake a realistic sense of notable accomplishment in the later years .

		All of which was generally known , and in this volume may be rendered still more familiar .

		The data as handled yield nothing more than illustrative material , and do not antagonize the essential import of what Dr.
Osier	PERSON	had in mind .

France	LOCATION	, 1789-1907 , '' by Pro- fessor
Frank Maloy Anderson	PERSON	, is published by the
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is a revised and greatly en - larged edition of a work first published
four years ago	DATE	.

		It belongs to the familiar class of source-books for the use of college students of history , and is one of the most thorough compilations of its class .

		French documentary material is peculiarly attractive in form , and has no little stylistic virtue , wherein it stands in striking contrast to English material of the same sort .

		All of the French constitutions are here included , and are given nearly intact .

		Begimiing with the decree creating the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	in
June , 1789	DATE	, and ending with a group of documents concerning the recent separatiou of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, this collection leaves practically nothing to be desired by the ordinary student in this most fasci - nating field of modern history .


Joshua Sylvester	PERSON	's translation of the '' Sepmaine '' of
Gui Maume de Saluste	ORGANIZATION	,
Seigneur du Bartos	PERSON	, is chiefly known to English readers through its associations with
Milton	PERSON	, who when a boy was profoundly impressed by the poem , and whose '' Paradise Lost '' shows many evidences of his familiarity with this French Protestant epic .

		Even
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not scorn , upon occasion , to transmute its dross into his gold , and echoes from Sylvester may be heard in .

		many other English poets .

		The student of literary history is , then , considerably indebted to the new edition of Sylvester which Mr.
Theron Wilber Haight	PERSON	has now produced , and which is published by Mr.
H. M. Youmans	PERSON	,
Waukesha	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		As the only edition published since the Restoration period , it is a welcome addition to our apparatus .

		The volume contains the greater part of Sylvester 's work , and the text is modernized , but discreetly treated in this respect .

		Not the least interesting part of the work is Mr.
Haight	PERSON	's breezy introduction , which alluringly invites to the text that follows .

		A special extra number of
The International Studio	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Lane -RRB- is devoted to
Augustus Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	and forms a handsome tribute to the memory of the first of Ameri - can sculptors .

		Besides a series of photographic repro - ductions in half-tone , showing the development of his art from his first production to his last , there is a brief chronology of his life , a chronological list of his works executed during the forty years from
1867	DATE	to
1907	DATE	, and an appreciative essay by the English sculptor Mr.
C. Lewis	PERSON	Hind .

		Despite the small scale of some of the illustrations , it is possible to gain from them a very fair idea of the strength and the limitations of
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	.

		In aU that he did the master 's fine feeling for the plas - tic nature of his material is evident ; the treatment is always consistently dignified , and marked by careful 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, avoidance of theatrical effects .

		A certain quality , best described as pictorial , detracts a little from the merit of some of his portraits in relief .

		But in his more im - portant productions he rises to the height of imquestion - able greatness .

		The compelling charm of these works is keenly felt by Mr.
Hind	PERSON	, and his intelligent and sympathetic essay is Mrritten under their spell .

		The poems of
John Ruskin	PERSON	form a new volume in `` The Muses ' Library , '' published by

		The introductory essay by Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	is naturally amusing , but hardly illuminat - ing .

		But the poems are well deserving of a place in this series .

		Although written very early in life , and insignificant in comparison with the author 's prose , they deserve a better fate than oblivion , and we are glad to find them made accessible to the public in an inexpen - sive form .

		`` Principles of Physiology and Hygiene , '' by Dr. G `` orge
Wells Fitz	PERSON	, is a new school publication of
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a highly satisfactory text for high schools , and its treatment of the moot ques - tion of stimulants and narcotics is considerably less offen - sive to scientific method than is customary with works of this class .

		The subject is taken by itself , for one thing , instead of being impertinently intruded into every chapter .

		THE DIAL 361 `` AIX '' Under this pseudonym there has suddenly appeared a writer , whose name is unknown to his publishers , whose style bears no resemblance to that of any living author , and who has instantly aroused the curiosity of the highest criticism by applying to modern business , politics , and social life in the incomparable `` Adventures of a Nice Young Man '' a style of early Georgian purity .

		The story is one of present day social and business adventure , with brief comments on life , manners , business , and public questions .

		The humor and arrangement resemble Fielding , the sentences
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and the didactic passages
Bolingbroke	LOCATION	; though in all the abuse that many of the author 's opinions have received , he has never incurred the reproach of artificiality .

		Preserved by style and humor this novel is the one that seems destined to hand down to a later generation a faithful picture of contemporary manners .

		The author immediately challenges a place in American literature not below that of
Washington Irving	LOCATION	.

		That this is not conventional publishers ' praise is shown by the following comments from letters received to be forwarded to the author .

		Mr.
GamaKel Bradford , Jr.	PERSON	, one of the most eminent critics in
New England	LOCATION	, says , addressing ``
Aix	LOCATION	'' through his publisher : `` How did you manage to write about Modern
New York	LOCATION	in the style of
Goldsmith	PERSON	and Fielding ?

		For it is the style of
Goldsmith	PERSON	and Fielding even to the broad words , which some prudery will sniff at .

		You have caught it -- the little twists and tiu-ns , the admirable self-restraint of touch .

		I enjoyed it exceedingly . ''

		Professor
Walter Morris Hart	PERSON	, of the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
California	LOCATION	, -- '' '
Aix	LOCATION	, ' whoever he may be , is surely a lineal descendant of Fielding , for he has succeeded in reproducing that style in a de - gree that I did not think was possible . ''

		Mr.
H. C. Chatfteld-Taylor	PERSON	, the biographer of Molifere , says , '' To me the story has a peculiar charm , caused , I should say , by your picaresque touch , your hero being a Lazarillo or a
Gil Bias	PERSON	in modern dress . ''


Horatio S. Krans	PERSON	, the well-known
New York	LOCATION	critic , and the author of the critical biography of
Goldsmith	PERSON	that introduces the Putnam edition of the works of
Goldsmith	PERSON	, says , `` It is an extra - ordinarily presentable work and most pleasantly reminiscent of the tone , temper , and manners of the eighteenth century novelist , '' FROM THE GENERAL PRESS WE CULL THE FOLLOWING : '' It has the .

		picaresque quality which makes
Gil	PERSON	Bias a joy forever ... His comments on life and manners with which the book abounds are a rare combination of seriousness and lightness . ''

		--
Chicago Inter Ocean	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		An unusually fine style , a delicate choice of words , that makes its reading a pleasure to be lingered over . ''

		--

		A story written after the manner of Gil Bias ... deserves to be widely popular .

Lincoln	LOCATION	's life .

		The author has been impressed with the fact that he could hope to main - tain that dignity which the subject demands only by avoiding the temptation to verbal elaboration and undue imagery .

		For the Emancipation episode the Spenserian stanza is employed , and the ballad and ode forms are used to give further variety to a work which seeks historic accuracy while avoiding prosaic statement of fact .

		417 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 422 DIAPHANOUS LITERATURE .

		An old protest , but one that can not be voiced too often , is again made in a recent article by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, whose powers of clear thinking and cogent reasoning have done so much , in so many directions , to keep our gen - eration in the paths of sanity .

		Whatever Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's theme may be , -- ethics , politics , philosophy , or aesthetics -- he has a way of striking at its heart , or of penetrating as with shafts of clear sunshine the obscuring mists of verbiage or sentimentalism that have gathered around it .

		The text with which he now pro- vides us is the following : '' It is too much the fashion of our day to require in poetry a subtle involution of thought , cryptic parables , the ' curious felicity ' -- or rather the laborious ' curi - osity ' -- of precious phrase , such as may rival the ambiguity of a double acrostic in a lady 's journal .

		There are some who will hardly count anything poetry unless it need many a re-reading to unravel its inner connotations .

		And for the sake of this subtlety , or rather as a hall-mark of this superfine ' mentality ' as they call it in their jargon , they desiderate an uncouth - ness of diction , or at least a sputtering cacophony of strident discords , that would ' have made Quintilian stare and gasp . '

		For my part , I have no taste for commdrums rhymed or unrhymed .

		I will read no poetry that does not tell me a plain tale in honest words , with easy rhythm and pure music ?

		If this personal declaration were to become an accepted canon of appreciation on the part of intelligent readers in general , there would be a wholesome housecleaning of literary premises everywhere .

		Such a consummation would , no doubt , leave many a scribbler with his occu - pation gone , but it would make most wonder - fully for strength and vitality in the world of letters .

		Even in
this twentieth century	DATE	, we are still harvesting the aftermath of the romantic spirit , and with it many weeds of adventitious origin .

		Often , we do not get even the iridescent color - ing of romanticism , for which it is easy to make allowance , but dull obscurity and the fuliginous darkening of counsel .

		Even those of the clear - est powers of vision wilfully hide their light , while their feeble imitators , who have no light to hide , don the concealing robes , and wear them with so impressive a pose that many are deluded into taking the wearers for prophets of authentic lineage .

		The trick of mystification is readily learned , and many a masquerader , vacuous of real intellectual substance , gets a fol - 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, lowing by adept practice of the arts of charlatan - ism .

		In a certain sense , such unquestionably great writers as
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Browning	PERSON	and
Meredith	PERSON	are responsible for the straining and preciosity that infect so much of our current literary production .

		It is their example that gives vogue to so many of our word-mongers in prose and verse .

		These men need no manner - isms to buttress the solid structure of their thought , for without mannerisms they would be equally great and equally individual ; but what is with them the accident is too often mis - taken for the essence by their would-be copyists , and is found to be easily imitable . ''

		Words without thoughts never to Heaven go , '' but it is too frequently the case that they may have a fairly successful life upon earth , and work much mischief before their force is spent .

		With this mischief in the world of practical affairs we are not here concerned .

		The dema - gogue , the philosophaster , and the yellow journal - ist make it a-plenty , and the evil that they do lives after them , besides being patent in the present .

		It is to the mischief done in the do - main of art , and particularly of literary art , that attention is now directed .

		From the use of words for the concealment of thought to their use for the concealment of its absence is an easy step , and one that seems to be taken by extra - ordinary numbers of writers at the present time .

		How else should the voracious printing-presses be fed with '' copy , '' or the artless public get its intellectual breakfast-food ?

		The appetite of the masses may , of course , be served with common - place thoughts and sentiments garnished with the tissue-paper ornaments of commonplace rhetoric , and their case has thus been disposed of in all ages .

		But just above the level of the masses there is a stratum of readers who de - mand some touch of distinction in the product set before them .

		Fortunately , a sham distinc - tion is sufficient for their needs , and they think brummagem quite as good as gold .

		These give to the pretentious writer , who has nothing to say but many ingenious ways of saying it , the opportunity for which he has been seeking , and he sets bravely out to win with his pen the plaudits that may be thus cheaply got .

		Among his methods are the employment of tortuous constructions that have to be puzzled out , and bold ellipses that permit several guesses for each meaning .

		Sometimes he acquires a reputation for great subtlety of thought by the use of qualifying clauses , and puts so many of them into a sentence that when it is ended one wonders what it started out to say .

		Sometimes he indulges in reckless figurative language that he may be credited with great powers of imag - ination .

		Still , again , he darkly hints that his writing is symbolical , and wiU reveal a precious inner significance to those who penetrate its verbal veil .

		This is a particularly fetching trick , because anybody can find symbols in anything by looking hard enough , so each investigator may feel sure that he has discovered the right ones , and admire his own acumen with all the naive satisfaction of an intellectual
Jack Horner	PERSON	.

		Finally , if all these devices fail to bring the writer a following , he may resort to paradox , for paradox , if only startling enough , is unfailingly effective .

		Let him deny all self - evident propositions as a matter of principle , declare the wildest of absurdities to be the most obvious of truths , turn all current ideas topsy - turvy , posing throughout as the one normal thinker in a mad world , and he will soon enjoy a very pretty reputation as a philosopher .

		Examples of how the thing has been done will come to the mind of every reader of current fashionable literature .

		The general case which we have been seek - ing to characterize was diagnosed long ago by
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, whose words fit present-day con - ditions with singular accuracy .

		Mediocre writers are much the same in aU times and countries . ''

		They say what they have to say in long sentences that wind about in a forced and unnatural way ; they coin new words aud write prolix periods which go round and round the thought and wrap it up in a sort of dis - guise .

		They tremble between the two separate aims of communicating what they want to say aud of concealing it .

		Their object is to dress it up so that it may look learned or deep , in order to give people the impression that there is very much more in it than for the moment meets the eye . ''

		We fancy that many a showy reputation of our own day would shrink noticeably , or crumble to pieces altogether , if subjected to the tests sug - gested by this incisive passage .

		The kind of writing to which our attention has above been devoted is anything but diapha - nous , and the title of our article is clearly a mis - nomer unless it may be justified by invoking the law of association by contrast .

		It came to us from Landor by way of Professor Ker , whose words upon the Icelandic sagas we wish now to quote .

		`` There is nothing equal to them anywhere for their power of recording life .

		To use the words of Landor about his own poems , they are not prismatic , but diapha - nous ; those who look into them can see through .

		One looks through into the tenth century , into the thirteenth , one sees men there , not as < trees walking ' ; one hears their conversation , not muffled in a learned language -LRB- like so many good things in Giralddus Cambrensis and

		THE DIAL 393
Matthew Paris	PERSON	-RRB- , not dressed up with rhetoric , not para - phrased or otherwise cooked , but their very words .

		It is true , and fortunately true , that good memoirs are com - mon in all times and languages .

		But nowhere are things seen , and heard , so clearly as in the Icelandic stories . ''

		Life was simple in the days of which those stories were told , and it is highly complex in ours .

		Probably it is impossible for us now to recover the magical simplicity of the sagaman 's art , but it is surely not unprofitable to hark back to it , and to seek to learn something from its example .

		THE CASE OF FICTION .

		It was only the other day that criticism began to take prose fiction seriously , but it has done its best to make up for lost time .

		The universities offer courses in the novel ; grave doctors discourse of its origin and development .

		It is not strange that note - worthy discoveries have ensued with regard to its scope and function .

		Prose fiction is , we now learn , the one art or achievement upon which our material age may rightly plume itself .

		It is pretty well agreed that in other fields the last word had been said before the modern race of men came into being ; the gift of prose narrative being our one natal gift .

		To be sure , there had been some sort of prose fic - tion before
Richardson	PERSON	, before
Boccaccio	PERSON	even ; some - body once wrote a story of Ruth with a hand not far from masterly .

		But it is only our own age which could have produced an ''
Adam Bede	PERSON	'' or a '' Peau de Chagrin . ''

		But there is a tendency to go even farther than this , to fancy that fiction is about to supersede cer - tain older forms of literary art , such as narrative poetry and the drama ; and , mirabile dictu , this not by virtue of a decadence of the general taste , but by fairly defeating them on their own ground .

		A recent writer begins his elaborate discussion of English prose fiction with this astonishing state - ment : ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not remark that it -LSB- Lyly 's Euphues -RSB- marked the genesis of a new kind of literature which was destined to usurp the place of acted drama .

		... To find plots for his drama ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	ransacked the Italian novelists , with - out perceiving that
Boccaccio	PERSON	and
Bandello	PERSON	had invented a form of art capable of expressing all the passions of human nature not less successfully than the drama itself . ''

		Are we really ready to assent to this ?

		Can we quite pit a Balzac against a Shakespeare ?

		Is the novel as pure a medium for the higher imagination as the play ?

		Is it , at all events , as pure a medium as the narrative poem , the true epic ?

		Or do we lay that flattering unction to our souls because prose fiction is the tool to which our hand is now best fitted ?

		-- because above all , to the mass of us to-day the novel virtually is litera - ture ?

		No doubt immense progress has been made during the past century in the technical handling of this graphic literary mode ; yet the relation of prose fiction to other forms of literature has under - gone no discoverable change : it is the attitude of the authorities that has changed . ''

		It confers a cer - tain dignity upon the study of fiction , '' says a recent critic , `` to remember how universal is the appetite for fiction . ''

		Precisely : human beings have always been listening for the story ; but we need not there - fore discuss
Hall Caine	PERSON	in terms of Shakespeare or of Homer .

		Prose fiction has not yet proved itself equal or comparable to poetic fiction .

		It is an unfor - tunate tendency of the day to confuse the boundaries of prose and poetry , to attribute to one the functions of the other .

		It may not have been a surprise to hear that sensitive enthusiast ,
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	, declar - ing that `` in the novel we have the meeting , the reconciliation , the kiss , of science and poetry . ''

		But which way were we to look when so cool a critic as the late Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	asserted that '' A novel - ist is on the border-line between poetry and prose , and novels should be , as it were , saturated with poetry '' ?

		The truth underlying the remark is clearly that the best fiction demands a high exercise of the imagination .

		But is it the same thing as the poetic imagination ?

		To speak of a novel saturated with poetry is like speaking of water saturated with sunlight .

		The water seems to contain the light , but remains itself , and is at best a defective vehicle for that celestial visitant .

		People did not hold these vague notions a few generations ago .

		If anybody ever wrote English prose which seemed to be saturated with poetry , it was DeQuincey .

		Certainly he himself discovered no promise of sublimity in the fiction of his day . ''

		To be a reader , '' he wrote sixty years ago , '' is no longer that honorary distinction which once it might have been amongst a more elevated , because more select , body of readers .

		... A writer of to-day , either in
France	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	, to be very popular must be a story-teller -- which is a function of literature neither very noble in itself , nor , sec - ondly , tending to permanence . ''

		A cavalier and old-fashioned way of disposing of the great modern art !

		But the kibe of the man of letters was then freshly galled by the advance of the popular story - teller .

		It is a favorite theory of a later observer , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, that
Walter Scott	PERSON	's success really marked the beginning of the end of serious reading on the part of the general .

		At the height of
Scott	ORGANIZATION	's first fame
Carlyle	PERSON	had prophesied over him in a notable passage . ''

		Literature , '' he cries , '' has other aims than that of harmlessly amusing indolent men ... There is nothing to be sought or found in the
Waverley Novels	LOCATION	.

		Not profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for edification , for building up or elevating , in any shape .

		The sick heart wUl find no healing here , the darkly-struggling heart no guidh , nce : the Heroic that is in all men no divine awakening voice .

		We say , therefore , that they do not found themselves on deep interests , but on com - paratively trivial ones ; not on the perennial , per - haps not even on the lasting . ''

		This is doctrine sterner than many of us would subscribe to .

		We 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, seem to have found some of these things in
Scott	LOCATION	; we seem to find him as lasting , at least , as his censor .

		Yet we can not defend him from the real charge -- that he fails in the test of supreme great - ness .

		He worked magic with that rushing pen , but the wizard of the North was after all only a wizard .

		There was no deep poetic faculty in him , and he remains in the end , to use
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's pitiless phrase , the great Restaurateur .

		It may reasonably be con - tended that the writer of fiction who sticks to his last can hardly achieve greater success than this -- to be a great Restaurateur .

		In the modern novel the genius of narrative often finds himself among strange bedfellows , exponents of political , religious , or social theory , who crowd him to the wall and well-nigh smother him in their discourse .

		But the divine awakening voice is not to be heard , for it is the voice of poetry , and a very different matter from the pleasant or busy voice of prose fiction .

		We may well remember that while the appetite for fiction has always been universal , the appetite for prose fiction is a creation of yesterday .

		And it can do us no harm to listen , now and again , to some such abrupt dictum as that which the late
Churton Collins	PERSON	uttered , quite without apology : '' Popular fiction moves in a sphere of its own .

		It has its own public and its own fortunes ; with serious literature it has no influential connection . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A POPULAR ANNUAL PERIODICAL is the never - failing almanac , which makes its yearly appearance on the news-stands about this time , as a reminder that another twelvemonth has nearly fled and a new one is about to begin .

		The word '' almanac '' is of uncertain derivation , but probably from the Arabic .

		The thing it denotes is of great antiquity , \ he fasti of the old Romans being a crude sort of almanac , and the printed calendar as we now know it being almost as old as the art of printing .

		Taking ad - vantage of the fascination of the inscrutable , almanac - makers early besprinkled the pages of their annual productions with all sorts of prognostications , not merely concerning the weather and the convulsions of nature , but also regarding occurrences of pecul - iar , local , and even personal interest .

		So mischiev - ous , in fact , did these pretended prophecies prove themselves in
France	LOCATION	that as early as
1579	DATE	they were forbidden by royal decree .

		The pages of Italian almanacs are sprightly and amusing by reason of their inter jectional comments on the weather .

		Turning to the date
July 30	DATE	, one may read , for example , ''
Sudano	PERSON	ancora le ossa ! ''

		^ ven the bones sweat -RRB- ; and exclamations abound like '' Oh , what an insufferable heat ! '' ''

		My birthright for a mantle of morning dew ! '' ''

		The foul fiend take this stifling sirocco ! ''

		The first American almanac is said to have been published by
William Pierce	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	in
1639	DATE	, while the most famous one was undoubtedly '' Poor
Richard	PERSON	's Almanac , '' which
Franklin	PERSON	began to issue in
1732	DATE	and con - tinued for about twenty-five years . ''

		The Ameri - can Almanac , '' of about 1828-60 , afterwards revived by the late
Ainsworth R. Spofford	PERSON	for a number of years , is also familiar to those interested in such things .

		`` The New England Almanac '' -LRB-
1775	DATE	-
1817	DATE	-RRB- of
Isaiah Thomas	PERSON	, the famous
Boston	LOCATION	printer , and '' The Old Farmer 's Almanac '' of
Robert B. Thomas	PERSON	-LRB- also a
Boston	LOCATION	printer -RRB- , now in its
117th year	DATE	, are likewise historic .

		The voluminous and miscellaneously instructive newspaper almanacs are to-day well-nigh numberless .

		• • • The reference librarian 's arduous task calls for more than scholarship and sympathy and tact and training ; it demands powers of divination , of mind-reading , a Sherlock-Holmes keenness of observation and unerring shrewdness of inference .

		The applicant for aid from the reference librarian may not , and often does not know exactly what he wants ; but that is no excuse for languid service on the librarian 's part .

		He should know the appli - cant 's mind better than does the applicant himself ; he should skip nimbly and noiselessly hither and yon in cheerful quest of just the right books or pamphlets or maps or prints to meet the require - ments of the case ; and he should at last send the satisfied applicant away swelling with new knowl - edge and beaming with self-satisfaction .

		In a late number of the
Indiana	LOCATION	'' Library Occurrent '' is a short article on '' Reference Work '' from the pen of the
Michigan City	LOCATION	librarian , who thus presents the ideal to be aimed at by the person in charge of this work : '' Upon finding out what the reader really wants , and that is a difiicult and painstaking process at times , the librarian should be able to size up the information-seeker and know immediately whether he is a dictionary man or whether , perhaps , he might not be an encyclopedia man , and , what is still better and will bring joy to the heart of the usually discouraged librarian of a small library , he may be a real student and want everything to be had on the subject .

		In order to give the right book to the right man , the librarian must be perfectly familiar with the character of the material in the different books , and this means work . ''

		Yes , indeed -- hard work ; reading and remembering the contents of some five hundred volumes a day would make a man a very fair reference librarian by the time death overtook him at his task .

		But this is a world of remote approximations , and we have to be satisfied with less perfectly equipped reference librarians .

		• • • Pragmatism at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	appears to be shaking the philosophical structure of that
University	ORGANIZATION	to its foundations .

		An Oxford graduate who is now pursuing philosophical studies at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	recently sounded a note of alarm in an able and interesting paper read at the opening meeting of Professor
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		395
Royce 's Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		His essay , entitled '' The Present State of Philosophical Study at
Oxford	LOCATION	, '' concluded with this significant paragraph : '' In the
summer	DATE	of this year Professor James gave a course of lectures in
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		Those lectures were of a character to which
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is unaccustomed , and -LRB- this is the point -RRB- of a kind quite out of harmony with
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	's tradi - tional mode of philosophical teaching .

		Yet Professor James had the largest audience which
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	has probably ever seen at a philosophical lecture .

		It was a singular event ; and many wondered whether it marked the beginning of a new era , and , if so , how much of the old way , so highly valued and so long cherished , would be likely before long to remain ... For myself , I feel that , as far as
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and her purpose are concerned , there never can be any way better than the one so long in use , which I believe will survive all present unrest and dissatisfaction . ''

		This is not the place to discuss the merits of rival philosophies , but even the most cursory backward glance at the germination , growth , and decay of system after system of philosophical belief ought to inspire a reasonable certainty that the universe can withstand the strain of yet another change in this respect .

		That gasping sense of dismay which inevi - tably accompanies the wrenching away of old props and buttresses is indescribably awful , to be sure , but one nearly always recovers breath a little later .

		• • • The national note in literature may be a grand and a stirring note , but it is not the note of strongest and most universal appeal .

		Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, in his address the other day at the seventy - first anniversary of the founding of
Mt. Holyoke Seminary	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now
Mt. Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , deplored the absence of this national note in our literature as if it were the one desideratum required to make that litera - ture truly great .

		Speaking particularly of poetry , he said : '' The body of tolerably acceptable contemporary verse is enormous .

		It shows a wide range of thought and a commendable technique .

		In one department , at least , it has manifested a notable progress during the past five years , namely , in the poetic drama .

		Yet how rarely in the mass of lyric verse does one catch the national note !

		More sonnets are written about
John Keats	PERSON	than about the
United States of America	LOCATION	. ''

		The greatest poets , however , and prose writers too , have addressed themselves to no nation , but to all mankind .

		It is love rather than patriotism that takes up the harp of life and smites on all the chords with might .

		The national note in literature is too often the provincial note , and seldom gives the highest pleasure except as touched involuntarily and unconsciously , and when heard as the undertone to themes of perennial and universal significance .

		• • • The cosmopolitanism of our best authors can not be disputed .

		They strike , not the national note , but the international , or even the interplanet - ary .

		In a published interview with Mr.
W. J. Locke	PERSON	, the English novelist now visiting our shores , he is reported as exclaiming , when Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, and
Mark Twain	PERSON	were mentioned as of our country : '' What , are they Americans ?

		You really bring me up with a jerk when you claim these writers as Americans .

		Howells is a household word with us in
England	LOCATION	.

		As for
Mark Twain	PERSON	, he is not American , surely ; he belongs to the whole Anglo-Saxon race .

		I remember when I was a boy of fourteen I had learned his story of ' The Jump - ing
Frog	ORGANIZATION	' by heart .

		Every Englishman knows him , and we consider that he belongs to us quite as much as to you .

		And then , as you say , there is Henry James ; after all , is he not literally quite as much an Englishman as he is an American ?

		He lives in
England	LOCATION	... and he stands very highly with us , especially in his earlier novels , which are decidedly and deservedly popular . ''

		Years ago it used to be scornfully asked in
England	LOCATION	, Who ever reads an American book ?

		Now it might rather be asked , Who ever fails to read a good American book , or in reading it stops to think of its being American ?

		• • ■ '' Born in the purple '' is a fine phrase and a coveted attribute of one 's origin .

		But by no stress of retroactive exertion , by no utmost zeal in pedigree - chasing , has it hitherto seemed possible to make oneself of purple birth when that birth was just common green or gray or straw-color or drab .

		Now , however , all that is changed , and if the benevolent scheme of certain gentlemen at present consulting together in
London	LOCATION	is carried out , any American -LRB- or almost any American -RRB- with a certain modest sum in his pocket will be able to throw a purple glow about his cradle and to feel himself for - ever after a scion of chiefs and monarchs .

		In other words , an American `` Almanach de
Gotha	LOCATION	'' is un - der contemplation , to be called `` American Purple , '' and to contain the names of all those whose pride of birth , when properly touched , will respond -- to the tune of
$ 7.50	MONEY	-LRB- which entitles the proud one to a free copy of the book , post-paid -RRB- .

		What imper - tinent rhymester shall ever again dare say of our purple-born : '' A bridge across a hundred years , Without a prop to save it from sneers -- Not even a couple of rotten peers -- A thing for laughter , fleers , and jeers , Is American aristocracy . ''

		• • • Conservatism and caution in spelling - reform appears to be the watchword of the recently organized band of orthography-menders in
England	LOCATION	.

		They have established dignified and appropriate headquarters across the street from the British Museum , and have as their president no less a light in linguistics than Professor Skeat , and as secretary Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	. ''

		What is needed , and what we plan to arrange , '' this latter official is reported as saying on a recent occasion , '' is an international commission of experts to consider the situation and report on it .

		After receiving their report we shall be in a position to draw up a plan of campaign , and the English-speaking world will decide for itself 896 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, whether this movement , now only tentative , is a good and useful one .

		If it prove , as we believe it will , a boon and a blessing not only to children but to the whole community , it will gradually ' catch on ' and oust the old unreason .

		It will be , in fact , a case of the survival of the fittest . ''

		There is good sense in that .

		Festina lente is the best of mottoes for spelling-reform associations , and our cousins across the water , refusing to be stampeded in this matter by anyone in high civil station , have evi - dently adopted it .

		... The jargon of literary criticism , like every other system of nomenclature , tends to become , through much use , worn and slippery and vague .

		Terms not originally synonymous are interchanged , and thus precision and clearness are always demand - ing the coining of new words or the borrowing and adaptation of words from other fields of learning .

		As an example of the manner in which a term may degenerate from the sharply specific into the vaguely general , let us quote from a review of ''
Diana Mallory	PERSON	'' in a leading
London	LOCATION	literary weekly . ''

		At the risk of being thought meticulous , '' says the reviewer , `` we may be allowed to express surprise that so accurate a writer as Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	should have gone out of her way to say that Sir
James Chide	PERSON	was as ' innocent of books as Lord
Palmerston	LOCATION	. ' ''

		Surely , if the word meticulous -LRB- from Latin mettis , fear ; hence , fearful , timid -RRB- has so lost all definite - ness that it can be used instead of pedantic or over - particular , it is time it were thrown back into the melting-pot and its place taken by a bright , new , freshly minted , and clearly stamped piece of verbal coinage .

		.

		, , The '' Pseudonyms '' are a quiet little society of English librarians that may in a sense be likened to our own '' Bibliosmiles , '' a little conclave of choice and congenial souls gathered by mutual attraction out of the ranks of American library workers .

		The '' Pseudonyms '' appear to be as little fettered by constitution and by-laws as are the '' Bibliosmiles . ''

		They meet semi-occasionally in an informal way and discuss , informally , subjects of literary and library interest , or any topic whatever that happens to pro- voke discussion .

		Each member is at perfect liberty to air his views freely , and if opinions clash , so much the better .

		The society is described by current report as a secret society , meeting and dining in
Soho	LOCATION	, but not suspected of cherishing any treason - able , nihilistic , or anarchistic designs .

		So heartily enjoyable are its `` evenings at home '' that an invi - tation to one of them is prized by the lucky outsider .

		• • • `` The clown of the newspaper establish - ment , '' as the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Herald '' fittingly denom - inates the motley-clad comic supplement to the
Sunday	DATE	issue , has been discontinued by that leading
New England	LOCATION	journal ; and it is to be hoped that its lead will have a numerous following .

		Public protest is not ineffectual in such matters ; and as soon as the makers of
Sunday	DATE	newspapers are con - vinced that the people are weary of this particular form of ugliness and inanity , they will vie with one another in their promptness to suppress it .

		We heartily agree with the '' Herald '' when it says that '' comic supplements have ceased to be comic .

		They have become as vulgar in design as they are tawdry in color .

		There is no longer any semblance of art in them , and if there are any ideals they are low and descending lower . ''

		In the not too distant future it is to be hoped that the art of illustrating in color will become truly a fine art , and that the possessor of even a nickel may purchase some of its benefits ; but until then , let the
Sunday	DATE	newspaper put its paint-pot away and resume the sober garb of an earlier , more self-respecting age .

		• • • A THIRTY years ' EPISTOLARY FRIENDSHIP , if One may so name it , was maintained between the late Charles
Eliot Norton	PERSON	and
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		The two could have seen little of each other , and must rarely have had the pleasure of clasping each other 's hands ; for they were home-loving men , and they lived three thousand miles apart .

		But their correspondence was regular and frequent , and
Stephen	PERSON	's last days are said to have been especially cheered by those wel - come letters from
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		As Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	has taken timely occasion to point out , there are but few examples in literary annals of so warm a friend - ship kept alive so long by the interchange of letters .

		The lovableness of
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's nature receives no better testimony than
Lowell	PERSON	's affectionate letters to him from abroad .

		Studied and self-conscious in too much of his published correspondence , the poet of Elm - wood could let himself go in writing to his '' Ciarli '' -- as he liked to spell the name , in

		MISCORRECTIONS OF MISQUOTATIONS . ''

		Reference is made , in the issue of The Dial for
November 1	DATE	, in a paragraph on '' Miscorrections of Misquotations , '' to au apparent misquotation from
Fitz-Gerald	ORGANIZATION	's Rubaiyat of Omar .

		It is a variant reading .

		The first edition , published in
1859	DATE	, which remained long obscure , contained seventy-five quatrains , the twelfth of which reads : '' ' How sweet is mortal Sovranty ! '

		-- think some : Others -- ' How blest the Paradise to come ! '

		Ah , take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest ; Oh , the brave Music of a distant Drum ! ''

		THE DIAL 397 quatrains .

		The third line of the thirteenth quatrain here reads : '' Ah , take the Cash , and let the Promise go . ''

		IMPROVING THE LANGUAGE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Much has been said for and against the neutral language Esperanto .

		It has gained thousands of adherents , but its closest students have realized that some vital improvement was necessary before it would answer the requirements of science and of commerce in their international relations .

		Such an improvement , carefully made on the principle of maximum interna ^ tionality , is now a candidate for public favor .

		The simplified Esperanto , called '' Ido , '' is now in practical use , and boasts of two or three magazines in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		A few words selected at random will serve to show the superiority of '' Ido '' over the old Esperanto .

		STORY-TELLING IN SCHOOL AND LIBRARY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dls.l . -RRB-

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's argument for story-telling in the schools , as quoted in the comment on '' The Children 's Story - Hour at the Public Library , '' in The Dial of
Novem	DATE	- ber 16 , seems to me most convincing .

		We do need story-telling in our schoolrooms , and many teachers , feeling this need , are systematically studying the sub - ject under professional story-tellers .

		But why need the '' Story-Hour '' in either school - room or library be limited to '' 40 children '' ?

		We have in many school buildings large assembly halls seating 500 to 600 children .

		We also have large assembly rooms in many of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Library sub - stations in the '' field hoiises '' of the small parks .

		Many children clamor for the story-hour .

		If out of a large number forty or fifty children select books and follow a suggested course of reading , well and good ; but a large number besides will have felt the influence of the well-told tale , even though they may not at that time come in closer contact with the book .

		Occasionally , however , we need the '' Story-Hour '' in the library itself , to draw the children into the library building , into the presence of the books and the atmos - phere of book-lore .

		There should be , too , a closer cor - relation between the stories told in the library and in the school , and the lessons which the child is studying .

		Whenever possible , the librarian should visit the school - room and tell an occasional story .

		On the other hand , the teacher should visit the library and cooperate in the story-telling work there .

		There should be no division of interest ; the object of both teacher and librarian is to bring the child and the book nearer together .

		This can be done through the '' Story-Hour '' held both in the library and in the schoolroom .

		Our attention has been called to a commimication in a recent issue of The Dial , in which it is stated that '' The Tumbler of Our Lady , '' in the '' New Mediaeval Library '' published by us , is not now first translated from the Middle French as our advertisements claimed .

		We regret to perceive that the wording of our para - graph was not more definite .

		The old manuscript , which contains our particular version of '' The Tumbler of Our Lady '' and the remaining Miracles in our volume , is now first translated in its entirety .

		Several versions of the translated '' Tumbler '' we believe exist , though we do not know whether Mr.

		The Personality of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		* It would seem that the earthly advent of the Great Man , who is to be predominant in his sphere and exercise a transforming and elevat - ing influence upon his age , should be accom - panied by signs and portents , significant and assuring to the expectant generation .

		We ought to know him in his infancy , watch with protecting care over his growth and develop - ment , save him from the disasters implicated in his unique temperament , and accept reverently his mature work and message , however destruc - tive of things long established and subversive of our choicest prejudices .

		Such , unhappily , is not the case .

		Unheralded , unproclaimed , he generally appears in some ob - scure corner of the earth in circumstances but little auspicious to the fulfilment of a great destiny .

		He struggles with needless difficulty toward a recognition of the part he is to play on the world 's stage , and when that consciousness arrives he finds himself worse off than before .

		Conservatism and conventionality bring against him all their deadening and deadly weapons .

		The hatred of the foolish and the ignorant wounds him even while he despises it .

		An atmosphere of chilling misunderstanding sur - rounds him .

		He waits for the hour of real appreciation ; and its arrival means a further questioning of his serious purposes and a pom - pous criticism of his intentions which rarely touches the nerve and heart of his life and labors .

		Moreover , his very nature and endowment incapacitate him for meeting successfully the difficulties of ordinary daily life in which his compeers of the average manhood play so com - petent a part .

		He belongs in a region appar - ently superimposed upon the visible and tangible experiences of earth ; there he is at home , and has intuitive understanding of its structure and employments ; here he fails in comprehension of trifling things , and loses his temper at obsta - cles and incongruities .

		Fortunate is such a man if he finds some kindly intermediator who , appreciative of the higher realms of art and poetry and philosophy , yet has an effective grasp of material things and the power to give the new revelation a place and meaning in the world .

Angelo Neumann	PERSON	; and no member of the genus irritabile ever had one more devoted or more capable .


Neumann	PERSON	was born in
Vienna	LOCATION	m
1838	DATE	.

		He was an accomplished singer , who began his career in the Opera at
Cracow	LOCATION	, and in process of time became a leading tenor in his native city at the Imperial Theatre .

		He was called in
1876	DATE	to
Leipsic	LOCATION	, by Dr.
August Forster	PERSON	, Manager of the Leipsic Theatre , and was made Director of the Opera there .

		He established a company noteworthy throughout
Germany	LOCATION	, played remarkable engagements in
Berlin	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	, and founded in
1882	DATE	the
Richard Wagner	PERSON	Theatre -- a travelling asso - ciation of artists who gave performances of the music dramas of the master in the leading cities of
Germany	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	; and later he was Director in
Bremen	LOCATION	and in
Prague	LOCATION	.

		The
Wagner Opera	ORGANIZATION	owes
Neumann	PERSON	an immense debt of recognition and gratitude .

		In
Neumann	PERSON	's `` Personal Recollections of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, '' now offered to American readers in an English translation , the author 's first study of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's works is presented as follows : '' It was the celebrated singing teacher of those days ,
Therese Stilke-Sassi	PERSON	, of
Vienna	LOCATION	, who gave me my first introduction to the genius of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	and fired me with an early enthusiasm for his new and wonder - ful style .

		This remarkable woman was training me for the stage , and taught me among other things the part of
Wolfram von Eschenbach	PERSON	in Tannhauser . ''

		I mention this particularly as in those days -- the early forties * -- it was rare indeed to find a singer with this role in his repertory , and managers then found it most diffeult to cast the important part .

		Being young and impressionable -- a boy of nineteen -- I soon became an ardent disciple of the Master . ''

		This enthusiasm grew with the passage of the years .

		In
1862	DATE	, when
Neumann	PERSON	became a member of the
Royal Opera Company	ORGANIZATION	in
Vienna	LOCATION	,
Wagner	PERSON	began his own career in that city .

		He was endeavoring to produce his '' Tristan , '' which after forty-seven rehearsals was pro- nounced wholly impossible .

		He was giving great concerts in which he tried to interest the public in his new and extraordinary music .

		Later ,
Neumann	PERSON	was in the Royal Opera Com - pany when
Wagner	PERSON	conducted his rehearsals for '' Lohengrin '' and '' Tannhauser . ''

		Of these rehearsals , our author says : '' I was especially interested , as I then contemplated taking the superintendence of a theatre myself .

		What an inspiring director he was !

		How he understood the art of spurring on his men , of getting his best work out of each one of them , of making each gesture , each ex - pression , tell !

		These rehearsals convinced me that • This seems inaccurate , would be nineteen in

Richard Wagner	PERSON	was not only the greatest dramatist of all time , but also the greatest of managers and a marvellous character actor as well .

		Now at the end of these long thirty years I can still distinctly recall certain incidents of his wonderful mimetic powers . ''

		On
August 13 , 1876	DATE	, the first performance of the '' Nibelungen Ring '' occurred at
Bay	LOCATION	- reuth .


Neumann	PERSON	was then Director of the Leipsic Theatre .

		Dr.
Forster	PERSON	, the manager of this theatre , returned from the first presenta - tion of the Cycle with the strong conviction that the work was not deserving of repetition .

		He dissuaded
Neumann	PERSON	from going to
Bayreuth	LOCATION	to attend a second performance of the Cycle .

		A friend from
Vienna	LOCATION	--
Julius Nilius	PERSON	-- had returned with
Forster	PERSON	from
Bayreuth	LOCATION	, and after the theatre the three went to a restaurant for supper . ''

		There the conversation naturally turned on the ` Ring . '

		When I admitted that I 'd given up going on the , strength of
Forster	ORGANIZATION	's account ,
Nilius	PERSON	exclaimed , ' I want to tell you something , my dear fellow .

		Of course I ca n't judge whether or not the staging is possible , but of one thing I 'm quite sure ; and that is , that in your capacity as director of the opera in
Leipsic	LOCATION	, it 's nothing short of your duty to see this performance , no matter what it conflicts with . '

		As he said this , he drew from his pocket a ticket for the second cycle and handed it to me . ''

		The visit bore its expected fruit , for two years thereafter , in spite of tedious waits and delays , disheartening obstacles , and serious discourage - ments ,
Neumann	PERSON	produced the '' Nibelungen Ring '' at Leipsic with great success .

		On this occasion Liszt came over from
Weimar	LOCATION	, and telegraphed to
Wagner	PERSON	, ``
Neumann	PERSON	has man - aged the affair in some respects even better than you did at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	. ''

		After Leipsic ,
Neumann	PERSON	proceded to the other and larger successes .

		He was emboldened to undertake greater tasks and win more import - ant victories .


Berlin	LOCATION	allured him .

		The obstacles were manifold ; officialdom had to be met and appeased ; but the `` Ring '' was triumphantly put on the stage , and met the reception it deserved .

		Then came futile attempts to present the
Wagner Opera	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	; then the
London	LOCATION	triumph ; finally the organization of the
Wagner Theater	ORGANIZATION	.

		This was a travelling company of the great singers of
Germany	LOCATION	, who visited the leading cities of the Fatherland , and played the Music Dramas before thronged and enthusias - tic audiences .

		All the noble artists were at one time or another under
Neumann	PERSON	's direction .

		He went about spreading the great new gospel , doing for the master what a disciple so devoted and so ardent alone could do -- making the world know how priceless a possession had again been placed in its keeping .

		The portrait given in these Recollections of the
Master	ORGANIZATION	, as
Wagner	PERSON	was now generally called , is a full-length and appreciative representation .


Wagner	PERSON	had now reached the recognition that placed him among the foremost men of his age .

		He was regarded as one of the great dramatists , and the first of musicians since
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Neumann	PERSON	shows everywhere the deepest admiration and reverence for him ; monarchs , statesmen , composers , litterateurs , vied with each other in honoring and lauding him .


Wagner	PERSON	was the most insistent of men in various ways , but he showed the warmest esteem for those who labored in his behalf .

		Neumann relates the following occurrence at the presenta - tion of '' Siegfried '' in
Berlin	LOCATION	: '' The Master had recommended his
Bayreuth	LOCATION	singer ,
Schlosser	PERSON	, for the part of Mime , but I had decided to give the role to
Julius Lieban	PERSON	, an ideal Mime and a member of our Leipsic cast .

		At the close of the first act ,
Wagner	PERSON	, who had never seen the young singer be - fore , could hardly contain himself .

		With his charac - teristic dash he flew on the stage , and stormed up the steps , passing Lieban , whom he did not recognize , in his hurry .

		The singer himself , young and inexperienced , was hurrying down the stairs , anxious to hear the Mas - ter 's verdict .

		As he passed him by , I called to
Wagner	PERSON	, ' Master , that is our Lieban , ' but not recognizing the name , he hurried on , still looking for the artist ; till I finally cried , ` Master , that is our Mime ! '

		Then he stopped suddenly , wheeled , and rushed at
Lieban	LOCATION	, who stood there , trembling at the thought of meeting
Wagner	PERSON	.

		The Master threw his arms about him in an ecstasy of enthusiasm , and when he exclaimed , ' You did that wonderfully -- it was simply matchless ! '

		the young fellow fairly cried for joy , and kissed his hand in reverence and gratitude . ''

		The relations between
Neumann	PERSON	and Wag - ner , though sometimes strained , recovered from every misunderstanding and closed with the profound friendship that was the result of a long and serious association .

		Neumann per - sistently besought the Master to give him per - mission to produce '' Parsifal '' outside of
Bay	LOCATION	- reuth .

		In an important letter
Wagner	PERSON	writes : '' ' Parsifal ' -- once and for all -- belongs exclusively to my
Bayreuth	LOCATION	theatre , and it is at our yearly festivals that this work is to be presented .

		The segregation is due to the lofty character of the work itself .

		My crea - tion of ' Parsifal ' shall stand or fall with
Bayreuth	LOCATION	.

		At least this shall be the case until my death ; for who then will carry out my intentions is still a problem to me .

		In case my powers , which are put to such unspeakable tests by these performances , should be exhausted be - fore my life , and I should no longer be able to attend to the details , I should have to think of some other 400 THE DIAL -LSB-

		If by that time your
Wagner Opera Company	ORGANIZATION	has reached that perfect plane towards which you are constantly advancing with my other works , I might then find it feasible to turn over to you my ' Parsifal ' for certain festival performances at stated occasions ; audit is only to you , and on these terms , that I shall ever consign my `` Parsifal . ' ''

		Mr.
Neumann	PERSON	's book is written in an agreea - ble and intimate style ; it has more interest than the novels of the day ; it tells a moving and heroic story ; it abounds in characteristic anec - dotes and incidents ; it places the master and his immediate entourage before us in clear light ; it brings us into close intimacy with the great people and great artists of the place and period .

		The translator ,
Miss Edith Livermore	PERSON	, has done her work well .

		The publishers have made a fine and presentable book .

		It contains a num - ber of portraits and a facsimile letter of Wag - ner 's , received by

		The DEVOIiOPMENT OF MODEKN ART .

		*
Julius Meier-Graefe	PERSON	's elaborate study of '' The Development of Modern Art '' is laid before English-speaking readers in two stout quarto volumes , finely printed , and embellished with a large number of full-page illustrations , mostly half-tones of excellent quality .

		These plates call for more than casual mention , not only because they contribute much to the attrac - tiveness of the volumes , but because they form au unusually representative collection covering the entire period dealt with in the book .

		In selecting the paintings , drawings , and sculptures for reproduction , pains have been taken to choose works displaying the salient characteristics of the artists ' styles .

		Therefore they reaUy illus - trate .

		Without their aid the book would not be as readable as it is , nor would the opinions expressed be as intelligible .

		The author calls the book '' a contribution to a new system of aesthetics . ''

		Nowhere , how - ever , in all the six hundred and fifty closely packed pages is there any attempt to formulate such a system .

		The nearest approach to it is in the following passage : '' The one point which I trust this book will make clear is the necessity for clearer views upon an organic system of -LCB- esthetics , an organic culture from which we • Modern Akt : Being a contribution to a New System of Esthetics .

		I hope to show that certain things belong not to culture , but to life , that these things are necessary to the expression of intellectual needs , and are to be accepted even more unquestioningly than the convention that we shall not eat with our knives or introduce ladies to gentlemen .

		Culture is the due com - pletion of our consciousness with everything necessary to the comprehension and furtherance of the claims of the present .

		Of a hundred important artists born within so many years , a certain number are indispensable , not because they produce this or that effect upon the mind , but because they affect their age and because they are symbolical of ourselves , and to know them is to have a true knowledge of our own life , to possess a means of resistance to that pessimism which can see nothing good in our own time , and a valuable weapon against the wild optimism which declines to see what is bad in it . ''

		This extract is quoted at length because it well sets forth the author 's major premise and at the same time affords a glimpse of his forcible and often piquant style .

		As reflected in what is apparently an excellent translation , this style is sometimes lucid and at other times a mixture of clever epigram and verbosity in which the leading thought is not readily disentangled from a wealth of illustrative imagery that obscures it .

		One may not always agree with what is said ; indeed , most readers are likely to find themselves alternately assenting to and differing from the views expressed .

		But always there is entertain - ment and mental stimulus .

		This is especially true of the brilliant opening chapter .

		In one significant paragraph , '' the great error that retards our artistic culture '' is so pertinently stated that it is impossible to refrain from a further quotation . ''

		In these days , the pure work of art has been brought into immediate contact with every-day life ; an attempt has been made to transform it utterly , to make it the medium of the aesthetic aspirations of the house , whereas this function belongs properly to the house itself and the utilitarian objects in it .

		We have tried to popu - larize the highest expression of art , something only significant when applied to the loftiest purposes , some - thing , the enjoyment of which without a certain solem - nity is inconceivable , or , at least , only to be attained in moments of peculiar detachment .

		We have succeeded merely in vulgarizing it . ''

		In the dominance of planes over lines , Mr , Meier-Graefe sees the quality that most mark - edly differentiates modern art from that which preceded it .

		He therefore begins his survey with
Rubens	PERSON	and Rembrandt , who , he says , with the Venetians and
Velasquez	PERSON	, were the heroes of the victorious struggle in which the new manner supplanted the old .

		The idea that in the contemplation of modern paintings the soul receives a sense of enlargement and enrich - ment beyond the power of line to communicate , runs through the author 's lengthy examination
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 401 of the position and achievements of the notable European artists of the eighteenth and nine - teenth centuries .

		With this there is constantly associated the idea of continuous growth and development from one artist to another .

		That the progress of art has been along what may be called evolutionary channels can not be gainsaid .

		Nevertheless , the aesthetic base upon whi -LRB- jh all art rests remains unchanged .

		The weak point in Mr.
Meier-Graefe	PERSON	's philosophy is the undue exaltation of a single aspect of truth .

		To this he might , and doubtless would , retort that upon the question of what is and is not aesthetic , opinions differ .

		Even so ; but in the last analysis it is neither line nor plane that counts , it is something beyond and above either -- the creative power that brings all the ele - ments in a composition into harmonic relation .

		This , if Mr.
Meier-Graefe	PERSON	perceives , he does not assert .

		Of his verdicts upon individual artists it may be said in brief , since it is impossible here to traverse the long chronicle with him , that they are always interesting .

		We are not , however , yet far enough removed from the
nineteenth century	DATE	to pass final judgment .

		* If there were a neater rendering of the facile Italian phrase , istruir dilettando , than `` to instruct while charming , '' I should like to bor - row it for use in connection with an incredible sort of book .

		considerations of its vivid portrayal of Italian life of the period , with the scarcity of good books in English relating to it , may justify the attempt to weigh once more what this youthful critic and historian had to offer .

		The reviewer 's general conclusion is pretty clearly indicated by the opening sentence above ; and his chief fear is that any sober attempt to map out the im - portant currents of the volume may obscure the fact that it is above all else interesting , readable , charming .

		Literary and musical studies in eighteenth - century
Italy	LOCATION	do not exact any particular knowl - edge of the political history of the peninsula .

		To my juvenile complaint that the history of
Italy	LOCATION	during that period was unattractive , a wise friend replied : '' Remember the treaty of Rastadt in
March , 1714	DATE	, which left to Charles VI .

		of
Austria	LOCATION	, as his share of the Spanish inheritance ,
Milan	LOCATION	,
Mantua	LOCATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	, and
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- dinia ; the transfers of
Naples	LOCATION	and
Sicily	LOCATION	to
Don Carlos	PERSON	in the early thirties ; the compara - tive quiet of the papal domain , the Venetian territory , and most of the minor states .

		Then forget the years until the coming of the French in
1796	DATE	. ''

		This invasion was the beginning of the storm , from which in the far future the new
Italy	LOCATION	was to emerge , -- the nineteenth-century
Italy	LOCATION	, with its divine aspirations , its bitter pro- tracted struggles and glorious self-realization .

		The eighteenth century was essentially a time of recovery from the blighting influences of the wretched Spanish regime .

		To the actual making of history ,
Italy	LOCATION	contributed practically nothing .

		In the writing of history , however , she numbered many honorable names , as she did also in philosophy and jurisprudence .

		In general literature there was considerable activ - ity ; and one recalls a few names of real dis - tinction .

		In tragedy we all remember
Alfieri	PERSON	, even if we forget
Maffei Martelli	PERSON	and
Antonio Conti	ORGANIZATION	.

		But in music , lyric drama , and comedy , she was making magnificent contributions , which must be understood if we are to grasp the sub - sequent history of these activities in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		This was perceived in some unexplained way by the youthful mind of
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, and the vol - ume before us deals primarily with music and comedy , and all the background of persons and places that they imply .

		The musical life of our period is not easily summarized ; indeed , it defies hurried treatment of any sort .

		You must linger at services in metropolitan cathedrals , where saints and angels are made to sing like heroes and heroines of opera , or in humbler provincial churches , where 402 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, you will realize that many years have passed since
Palestrina	ORGANIZATION	's day .

		You must loiter down village streets of an evening , in the golden Italian
summer	DATE	time , the mind vagrant as the wandering musicians themselves , the heart free from care , and take your place among the people listening to the hurletta ^ lightly rendered by strolling players .

		In the very streets there is music of serenaders , or larking shop-boys or what not ; and on the morrow you may hear boatman or peasant singing at his work .

		If you are fortunate you may be bidden to a dilettante concert at some cultured hospitable home .

		You must visit at least one of the famous charity music schools for boys at
Naples	LOCATION	, or for girls at
Venice	LOCATION	, where you will hear performances un - surpassed by the contemporary Parisian stage .

		Finally , when the late autumn has come , you must betake yourself to the opera house in one of the great musical centres and hear the ambi - tious lyric drama , the opera seria .

		The music will interest you much ; the players and singers , more ; the audience , perhaps , most .

		At first you will be indignant at these beaux and fine ladies playing cards in the boxes or chatting capri - ciously ; at these men in the pit comparing son - nets or epigrams .

		And why do the authorities allow such a nondescript disorderly mob in the gallery ?

		But a fine number comes and then you understand .

		The individuals of this audience , patrician and plebeian alike , love music and know music .

		When they are not paying attention , it is because attention is not deserved ; when they applaud , it is not because of the fame of com - poser or singer , but because there is something that charms their ears .

		Then you will agree with our author that art demands , not volitional attention , but instinctive appreciation .

		And per - haps , after all these varied experiences , you will realize that these eighteenth century Italians lived music , as it were , and that the serious opera is only a deeper breath of a general life .

		The word opera carries us back to the seven - teenth century , which saw the welding of melody , recitativo , mimetic , and mechanical show into the musical drama that these melomaniac southerners called the work .

		This was the heritage that
Apostolo Zeno	PERSON	and his successor ,
Pietro Metastasio	PERSON	-LRB- 1698-1782 -RRB- elaborated and brought to perfection .

		Roughly speaking , they used the much-berated recitativo for the action of the play , and melody for what may be called the stationary parts : '' the lyrical similes , the solitary outpourings , '' and similar features .

		The appearance of Metastasio 's '' Didone Abandon - nata '' in
1723	DATE	'' offered a musical perfection , an elegance of variety of blank verse and rhyme , such as had not hitherto been known . ''

		Between
1733	DATE	and
1740	DATE	he produced his masterpieces .

		Herein the recitativo , as primarily the poet 's work , was helped by the subordination of the musician , while the air was recognized as the latter 's realm , wherein the poet most glorified himself by giving all possible scope to the com - poser and vocalist .

		Throughout the greater plays , the emotional situation was developed with a finished skill that moved rapidly to its goal , while showing with adequate clearness each significant step .

		It is perhaps unwise to say that this type of lyric drama was not capable of greater achievement ; but at any rate subsequent generations quickly left the melodramma for the opera with which we are now familiar .

		It is easy to see how the development of rhythm , accompaniment , and concertation , of harmonic and orchestral elaboration , led to the nineteenth century opera , -- `` a symphony of voices and instruments accompanying , more or less closely , a dramatic action . ''

		But along this path , with
Gluck	PERSON	and
Mozart	PERSON	, we may not wander .

		By these German names we are reminded of the controversy as to the relative value of the contributions of
Italy	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	during the period under treatment , a question to which Miss Paget returns with great vigor in her new preface .

		She points out the priority of the Italians in melody , more particularly ; and dwells on the tremendous importance of all their '' pioneering '' work .

		The preponderant in - fluence of Scarlatti on the sequent generations of musicians in both countries , can hardly be questioned ; and our author indicates the rela - tions in a striking figure .

		Roughly speaking the Italian and German composers throughout the eighteenth century formed a brotherhood ; '' but a brotherhood as of
Jacob	LOCATION	and
Esau	PERSON	.

		Italian Esau , a mighty hunter -LRB- in Sir
Hubert Parry	PERSON	's text ' pioneer ' -RRB- , but impulsive and lazy , selling his birthright for the pottage of vocal virtuoso - ship and general slipshod facility ; German Jacob getting the blessing meant for his elder , and putting it to profit under the personal guid - ance of the god of Thoroughness , '' and so forth .

		But we may surely appreciate the work of the Italian Esau without belittling the services of the German Jacob .

		Comparison is without profit only when it seeks to lower one nation or person in order that another may be exalted ; and the student who has no aim save historical accuracy will gladly recognize that the eigh - teenth century maestro and the contemporary Kapellmeister were alike serving Apollo and

		403 the Muses for the ultimate weal of the art they cherished .

		In passing from the old
Opera Seria to Comedy	ORGANIZATION	, we make a rather abrupt but natural transition ; for they flourished side by side and in almost equal vigor .

		To some of us , perhaps , the latter is more of a reality ; and not a few readers for whom Metastasio is rather vague have a fairly distinct conception of
Goldoni	LOCATION	, the Menander of his century .

		And
Quintilian	PERSON	's tribute to the Greek , omnem vitce imaginem expressit , would be quite as applicable to the Italian .

		That ,
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's comedy grew out of the
Comedy of Masks	ORGANIZATION	is a commonplace ; but the history of the latter type is not clear in all its details .

		In some form or other it is as old as Italian civilization , or even a previous stage in Aryan development .

		A crude farce of buf - foons and improvisations is an early device of the mimetic creature called man .

		And down the centuries from Oscan days to the present year , some form of this primitive play has existed in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Passing over the earlier stages , we recall that during the unhappy days of the six - teenth century the Comedy of Masks saw a marked revival : '' Laughter in misery , buffoon - eries to drown the recollection of ignominy ; merriment to hide seditious sorrow , local satire to hide national satire , dialect to save Italian ; at any rate , one means of satisfying that inde - structible craving for fun in the Italian nature .

		Pan talon e ,
Brighilla	LOCATION	,
Arlecchino	LOCATION	, and II
Dottore	PERSON	were the four standard masks of the northern group .

		The terrible
Pulcinella	LOCATION	, the tempestuous
Scaramuccia	LOCATION	, the simpleton
Tartaglia	PERSON	, the vaga - bondish
Coviello	PERSON	, formed the equally represen - tative southern types .

		With them were count - less other buffoons , less generic and less abiding .

		These were the central figures in the Commedia delV Arte , although other actors were necessary , even for the slight plots about which the all - important drolleries played in erratic scintilla - tion .

		In the
sixteenth century	DATE	, companies of comedians were found everywhere in
Italy	LOCATION	; and in fact in many other parts of
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		In
1577	DATE	, for instance , we remember that a band of mask actors migrated to
England	LOCATION	, and exer - cised some considerable influence on English drama .

		In one sense , the old contention that
1600	DATE	marked the zenith of this comedy is right ; for by this time it had reached its '' most artis - tic shape and its highest polish . ''

		But there is as much truth in
Vernon Lee	PERSON	's contention that the seventeenth century was its golden age ; for it had a more vigorous , if less literary , life among the people .

		It was more itself , so to say , than in its finer clothes .

		At any rate this was the thing that came to
Goldoni	PERSON	's door and under his hands grew into the Realistic Comedy .

		At first not only did the general framework remain unchanged , but the written text merely represented the old extemporized interplay of dialogue .

		The actors were the old '' type '' actors , who had played Harlequin ,
Pulcinella	LOCATION	, and the rest .

		All was movement , retort , fun ; `` the scene changed as recklessly as the words . ''

		And in
Goldoni	LOCATION	's best period all of these origi - nal elements are perceptible ; but his actors be - come diversified and ordered ; his characters become coextensive with the life of his times ; his plots become less filmy and more natural , until he elaborates the high type of comedy seen in `` II
Vero Amico	PERSON	'' and `` La Locandiera . ''

		Of the waves of hostility that dashed against our comedian ; of his later years and laughter - moving memoirs ; of
Carlo Gozzi	PERSON	and the '' Venetian Fairy Comedy , '' written in reaction against the Realistic Comedy , we may not treat .

		But we may point out that
Vernon Lee	PERSON	has not given quite an adequate account of the various influences under which
Goldoni	ORGANIZATION	's power was developed .

		In our modest opinion she is too cavalier in her attitude towards Moliere ; and she has practically neglected the Venetian 's indebtedness to Plautus and
Terence	PERSON	, not to men - tion Aristophanes .

		Goldoni added a scholar 's training to his natural vis comica , and it is much easier to understand his career if we keep that fact in mind .

		Compared with the chapters that suggested the foregoing thoughts , those on '' The Arcadian Academy '' are less important .

		But they are delightful , and properly come first in the book ; for in our wanderings we do continually en - counter these Arcadians .

		On a
spring morning of 1692	DATE	, fourteen men interested in letters were meeting in the
Prati	LOCATION	di Castello at
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		It seems to-day as if
Arcadia	LOCATION	were reviving for us , '' said one of them , and the omen was grasped .

		Fourteen pastoral names were assigned to those present , and the
Arcadian Academy	ORGANIZATION	was consti - tuted .

		It was ambitious : it was to be the literary arbiter of
Italy	LOCATION	and make a golden age of poetry .

		It became the vogue .

		Colonies were founded in in every part of the peninsula from
Venice	LOCATION	to
Naples	LOCATION	; princes and senators mingled in this literary commonwealth .

		And all went well , despite internal disturbances , until it occurred to somebody that the thing was ridiculous , that
Arcadia	LOCATION	was a joke .

		Then it began to wane .

		In
1775	DATE	its glory was restored for a moment ; but ' it was only a flutter .

		And in the destruc - 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, tive years of transition from the eighteeenth to the nineteenth century ,
Arcadia	LOCATION	disappeared almost as the fabric of a dream .

		The first time I was in
Rome	LOCATION	one could find on the Janiculum a tiny villa , the old
Bosco Parrhasio	ORGANIZATION	, quaint in its very desolation .

		Already it was practically forgotten , and the pictures of the immortal shep - herds and shepherdesses had been removed to the
Academy	LOCATION	; by this time it has probably dis - appeared .

		And yet it once really represented literature in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The most hostile and fruitful criticisms of the volume have probably been written by Miss Paget herself , in the preface to the new edition .

		She says it must be full of presumptuousness and f oUy ; that the eighteenth century was hum - drum ; that the enthusiasm of youth is fuU of piety , but also of ruthlessness ; that her ignor - ance of music was pathetic ; that she never dis - tinguished between the novelist 's plausibility and historic probability .

		And there is much truth in these strictures .

		Howbeit , she loves her book too well to change it ; it is her dream , and for better or for worse shall be kept unmarred .

		Herein I think her instinct is right .

		Or , if she errs , it is with
Stevenson	PERSON	and all other good lovers of life who will leave to each age its own heart .

		In addition to the imperfections empha - sized by the author herself , any reader will note defects in style , some of them unpardonable ; but the book could not be re-written after thirty years without losing something from the beauty of its wings , if not some of its real power of flight .

		As one puts the volume aside , there arises the inevitable question : What sort of young person was this , who at the age of twenty wrote a book that is really valuable as well as a joy to the reader ?

		Some explanation is to be found in her subjects and sources ; for the matei'iarum ingenium is a very real thing .

		But this still leaves a decidedly large residuum to be explained by the personality of the author .

		In '' The
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and in some of her essays , we catch provoking glimpses of her earlier life and training , glimpses which make us hope that some day we shall be favored with a definitely autobiographical sketch of those youthful years , written in the fine vein discernible throughout her better writings .

		The book is weU printed , attractively ar - ranged , and handsomely bound .

		The illus - trations , selected by Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	of the
Laurentian Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, are excellent , and contribute their share to the vividness that is perhaps the salient characteristic of the work .

		F.
B. R. Hellems	PERSON	.

		Latter-day Novelists of
France	LOCATION	.

		* It needs no literary
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	to dis - cover a feminine hand in the volume entitled '' French Novelists of To-day . ''

		Phraseology and details of perspective aside , a critic of the masculine gender would scarcely have classed
Madame Favre de Coulevain	ORGANIZATION	, -- the bewilder - ingly eclectic admirer of
George Meredith	PERSON	and
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, the anxious student of five - o'clock teas and of the exact boundaries of the bourgeoisie -- with
Anatole France	PERSON	and
Paul Bourget	PERSON	, in a volume which presumably dis - cusses the most considerable of the current French novelists .

		It is only justice to admit that the author 's avowed object is somewhat different -- namely , '' to indicate what contem - porary French novels are likely to interest English readers . ''

		But is it impertinence to remind the fair critic that novels more likely still to interest English readers are `` Arsene Lupin '' and '' La Chambre Jaune , '' or certain volumes of dubious decency , and to suggest that she has attempted to pick those authors whose works ought to interest English readers rather than those that are likely to interest them ?

		With the possible exception of the lady men - tioned , the choice has been a good one for this purpose .

		If
Winifred Stephens	PERSON	is able to attract the general reading public 's attention to the eight notable novelists whose names fill her table of contents , she will succeed in doing what has thus far been done only very imperfectly , at least in
America	LOCATION	.


Pierre Loti	PERSON	is read here a little , and
Paul Bourget	PERSON	a little .

		One story by
Anatole France	PERSON	, '' The Crime of
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	, '' is known and loved ;
Marcel Prevost	PERSON	is attracting more attention in this country by his sociological theories than by his fiction ;
Rene Bazin	PERSON	is beginning to be known a little on this side of the water ;
Maurice Barres	PERSON	and Edouard Rod are no more than names to the average American reader .

		The volume carries as a motto the hopeful prophecy of
Paul Sabatier	PERSON	: '' Mysteriously and sadly , making many experiments and many mis - takes as she goes ,
France	LOCATION	is journeying toward a new ideal . ''

		It is difficult , however , to find a common ideal in the activities of the extremely varied eight before us ; and if the author has found it , she has made no clear statement of her discovery .

		Anatole
France	LOCATION	is so subtle and ironical that no one can confidently brand him * French Novelists of To-Day .

		THE DIAL 405 as either pious or irreligious .

		He confesses him - self a socialist , and rails at wealth and poverty .

		He is so far from a narrow nationalism that he stood next to Zola in the band of defenders of
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	.


Marcel Prevost	PERSON	is a dogmatist ; he never writes a line without a moral object .

		In literary theory he is as extreme a romanticist as
Anatole France	LOCATION	is decided in his preference for classical traditions .

		It follows very naturally that his fluent and vigorous style is full of faults that his great contemporary would never have been guilty of . ''

		The writers of the past , '' says
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	in discussing the writers of the present , '' sometimes wrote weakly ; they never wrote badly . ''

		Prevost is so far from the cheer - ful skepticism of the older writer that the fearful intensity of his interest in the preparation of '' Les Vierges Fortes '' resulted in a nervous breakdown .

		He is an ardent feminist , and is ready with theories and plans for the cure of every social evil .


Paul Bourget	PERSON	, on the other hand , is , as the author neatly puts it , '' the apostle of arrested development , '' An ardent Catholic for some years back , he places the world 's salvation in blind submission to tradi - tionary authority .

		Bourgeois by birth and early associations , he shows a preference for the aristocracy that lays him open to the charge of snobbery .


Maurice Barrds	PERSON	began his literary life as an individualist , but seems to be travel - ling toward collectivism ; literary artist and lover of words for their own sake like
Anatole France	LOCATION	, ardent Catholic like Bourget , he professes a socialistic theory as earnest as the former 's and a traditionalism almost as dogmatic as the lat - ter 's .

		Barres is a furious militarist , and a relentless Jew-baiter ; women are to him , for the most part , merely instruments for the bearing of children .


Rene Bazin	PERSON	, unlike all the others , is a whole - some , sweet-spirited optimist .

		He is careless of the existence of a feminist question .

		To him , a man is a human being and a woman another ; and the favorite French theme of unlawful love plays little part in his cheerful stories of the soil .

		There is evil in the world , and he dis - cusses it frankly ; but he sees it more than com - pensated for by the host of kind and thought - ful ones who are always at hand to soothe and comfort ; and he has no algebraic formulae to con - jure it with .

		He is not a mocker -- even a gen - ial one like
France	LOCATION	; he is very serious and very earnest in condemnation of the wrong ; but , in
Bruneti	LOCATION	^ re 's happy phrase , '' he never raises his voice '' ; he possesses the rare faculty of literary self-control .

		Edouard Rod , the nondescript Swiss pessi - mist , is fond of denominating himself un cher - cheur desinteresse , which our critic somewhat unexpectedly translates as '' a detached inves - tigator . ''

		He refuses to ally himself with any school of thought .

		A Calvinist by birth , he has grown so enthusiastic in his admiration of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	that the world has been waiting for him to follow the reactionaries into her bosom ; but the prospect of his doing so grows less and less .

		He has shifted in views and method more frequently and decidedly per - haps than any other writer on our list .

		At first a crass naturalist of the school of Zola , he has developed into an exponent of the manner of writing which he names by the self-explanatory term '' Intuitionism . ''

		His forte is the portrayal of the sort of violent passion which makes no appeal to
Bazin	PERSON	.

		Religiously an agnostic , he has no patience with bigoted anti-religionists ; profoundly moved by social problems of the day , he is as sure as is Bourget that the old ways are better .

		Last of all comes
Pierre Loti	PERSON	, unlettered and spontaneous as
Anatole France	LOCATION	is learned and artful ; purposeless as
Prevost	PERSON	is earnest , pagan as Bourget is Catholic ; selfish as
Edouard Rod	ORGANIZATION	is devoted ; a lover of art for art 's sake ; the greatest of living impressionists .

		Where is the common ideal toward which this group is tending ?

		They have not even the common trait of doctrinarianism which the critic who is somewhat barren of ideas may ordinarily attri - bute with safety to a Frenchman .

		There is nothing for it but to consider this book a collection of eight distinct biographical studies ; and very charming and suggestive little studies they are .

		Loti and
Bazin	PERSON	the poets ,
Anatole France	LOCATION	the curious scholar ,
Barres	PERSON	and Bourget and
Prevost	PERSON	the philosophers , are quoted , annotated , and catalogued , in a manner that is sane and thoroughly delightful .

		The picture of the young Loti , so filled with a long - ing for travel that '' pictures of palm-trees and the very word ' colony ' were enough to make him wildly excited '' is a vivid one ; and it is not easy to get away from the account of his first sight of the sea , which was to fill so much of his life with love , and fear , and sadness . ''

		He had gone with his parents to a village on the coast of Saintonge .

		On his first arrival he had not been able to catch a glimpse of the ocean , hidden behind sand-hills .

		But as soon as dinner was over , he could contain his curiosity no longer .

		He escaped alone , and in the darkening twilight made his way down a wind - ing path through the sand-hiUs to the shore .

		There was a keenness and a bitterness in the air he had 406 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, never before experienced .

		He heard in the distance a dull sound , at once loud and indistinct .

		Suddenly there opened out before his gaze the ocean wrapped in the glow of the
evening	TIME	sky .

		Paralyzed with fear , he stood still , while this dark roaring mass seemed to come up from all directions .

		Of a dark green color , almost black it appeared , unstable , perfidious , engulfing . ''

		The youth of
Anatole France	LOCATION	is described as sympathetically , although very differently ; in - deed , it was a very different sort of youth .

		As he himself says , in our present author 's trans - lation : '' At seven years old , I did not know how to read ; I wore divided skirts ; I cried when my nurse wiped my nose , and I was devoured by ambition .

		If I had been able I would have gone forth to win immortality on the battle-field ; but a horse , a imiform , a regi - ment , enemies , were not for me .

		Therefore I thought of becoming a saint .

		The profession of saint has fewer requirements and wins greater renown than that of a soldier . ''

		So he set about becoming a saint .

		But his attempts at fasting brought his mother down upon him with tonics and nostrums ; the servant refused to allow him to imitate
Stylites	PERSON	on the kitchen pump ; his father pronounced him crazy when he emulated St.
Nicholas	PERSON	of
Patras	LOCATION	by throwing his playthings and twelve new sous out of the study window , and unfeelingly thrashed him when he tried to manufacture a hair-shirt out of the cushions of the stuffed chairs .

		So he became sympathetic with the hermits who renounced all intercourse with their fellows and took up their abode in desert places ; and he thought seriously of retiring to a secluded corner among the wild animals of the Jardin des Plantes .

		The doctrinaires are not so amusing .

		I ques - tion if their work is as significant , even .

		It is possible that the gentle playfulness of `` The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard '' and the infinite sadness of '' The
Iceland	LOCATION	Fisherman '' will be remembered when all the romans a these are forgotten ; and that it is not Bourget the tradi - tionalist or Prevost the reformer whom succeed - ing generations will admire , but Bourget the consummate story-builder and
Prevost	PERSON	the sym - pathetic student of female character . ''

		French Novelists of To-Day '' is written for the '' general reader . ''

		It presupposes very little knowledge of the subject , and each chapter is headed with a complete list of the works of the novelist , with dates .

		The author also gives the date of each writer 's birth , with the excep - tion of
Pierre de Coulevain	PERSON	, who is a lady and hence exempt from chronological scrutiny .

		Those to whom '' a tiny rivulet of text meandering between broad meadows of margin '' signifies the acme of luxurious book-making will take much com - fort in the sumptuous setting given to Mr.
Otto H. Bacher	PERSON	's '' With
Whistler	LOCATION	in
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		If , because of the large type and broad expanse of blank paper , these reminiscences seem to have less substance than when printed in the pages of the '' Century Magazine , '' they have lost none of their entertaining quality , and exemplify once more the pertinency of the saying that personal recollections furnish a most agreeable form of literary dissipation .

		Especial interest attaches to these because they deal with a period in
Whistler	LOCATION	's life about which com - paratively little is known .

		Bankrupt as a conse - quence of the famous lawsuit with
Ruskin	PERSON	, he went to
Venice	LOCATION	toward the end of the year
1879	DATE	, having accepted a commission to make a series of etchings for the
Fine Arts Society	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		There Mr.
Bacher	PERSON	first met him , and the friendship was formed that continued unbroken as long as
Whistler	LOCATION	lived .

		Many anecdotes are related of the days that
Whistler	LOCATION	spent in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		These picture ''
Jimmy	PERSON	`` as an indefatigable worker , as the helpful and inspiring associate of a group of young artists of whom the narrator was one , and , in spite of his eccentricities and his dominant personality , as an ever-charming comrade and faithful friend .

		Incidentally they furnish considerable information about the methods employed by the master , which were often so pecu - liarly his own as to be inimitable .

		Bearing on this , an amusing tale is told of the Russian artist
Wolkoff	PERSON	-LRB- otherwise Roussoff , as he is known in
London	LOCATION	-RRB- , who ridiculed
Whistler	LOCATION	's pastels , declaring he could execute others that could not be distinguished from them .

		A wager followed ; then a long delay which
Wolkoff	PERSON	explained was caused by his inability to buy in
Venice	LOCATION	the brilliant pastels with which
Whistler	LOCATION	obtained his effects .

		He was then accorded an opportunity to select some pieces from
Whistler	LOCATION	's own box ; but they proved no better , the brilliancy lying not in the materials , but in
Whistler	LOCATION	's use of them .

		The volume is embellished by reproduc - tions of a number of the
Venice	LOCATION	series of etchings , and of several etchings by Mr.
Bacher	PERSON	of views from the windows of the
Casa Jankovitz	PERSON	, where
Whistler	LOCATION	roomed .

		Facsimiles are given of four letters writ - ten by him to Mr.
Bacher	PERSON	.

		In one of these mention is made of
Theodore Duret	PERSON	, the Parisian connoisseur , whose portrait is one of
Whistler	LOCATION	's masterpieces .

		Strange as it may seem , neither Mr.
Bacher	PERSON	nor his publishers have been able to read the name , though it is plainly written ; and in the text of the book it is printed '' Ducet -LRB- ? -RRB-

		. ''

		The good taste of including the letters of '' Maud Whistler '' is perhaps open to question ; and in always making
Whistler	LOCATION	refer to himself by name there is an implied intimation that

		THE DIAL 407 this was his customary manner of speech , whereas the truth is that such an aif ectation was most unlike him .

		For printing
Whistler	LOCATION	's own version of the well-known goldfish story , the ai 't ist 's friends owe Mr.
Baclier	PERSON	a deht of gratitude .

		Even Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	ascribe the exploit to
Whistler	LOCATION	himself .

		This ascription Mr.
Bacher	PERSON	stigmatizes as a libel , and says the actual performer was a clever French - man , once
Whistler	LOCATION	's roommate in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		The late
Grant Allen	PERSON	, who had a mind so many - sided and keenly sensitive to life in all its aspects that he has been described as '' naturalist , anthro - pologist , physicist , historian , poet , novelist , essayist , and critic , '' always contrived to invest his chosen topics with fresh interest by considering them from some novel point of view .

		One of his early efforts was an investigation into the physiology of aesthetics , upon which he published a treatise in
1877	DATE	.

		He was not an art critic in the oi ` dinary sense of the term , but being compelled by ill-health to spend many winters in a climate less rigorous than that of
England	LOCATION	he had abundant opportunities for visiting Italian and other art galleries and utilized them in studies for which his early work had been a prepara - tion .

		The outcome of his observations was a series of papers in the '' Pall Mall Gazette `` and the '' English Illustrated Magazine , '' which are now reprinted in a handsome volume with their original title , '' Evolu - tion in Italian Art '' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		These papers , left practically complete at the author 's death , have been revised and brought up to date by Mr.
J. W. Cruickshank	PERSON	, who supj -RRB- lies a useful historical intro - duction .

		The novelty of Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's treatment of the subject is in `` the conception of the individual composition as an organic type evolving along lines of its own . ''

		Taking up the principal themes of the Italian painters , such as the Marriage of the Virgin , the Visitation , the
Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, the Adoration of the
Magi	ORGANIZATION	, etc. , he shows that each picture should be viewed as a variant upon a central type , and that `` the variations themselves follow fixed laws of develop - ment . ''

		This applies also to the separate figures of saints that appear in many different compositions .

		The conditions under which the early Italian artists worked made the course of evolution peculiai ` ly direct .

		The artists themselves were free agents only to a very limited extent , receiving as a rule commis - sions for some definite work , such as a
Transfigura	ORGANIZATION	- tion , or a
Madonna and Child	ORGANIZATION	attended by certain specified saints , it even being required in many cases that the treatment should closely follow the repre - sentation of the same subject in such and such a picture by another hand .

		That Mr.
Allen	PERSON	has proved his contention must be admitted .

		Incidentally , by the exercise of the close analysis and comparative method employed in scientific research , he throws light upon various items that help to better under - standing of the works of the primitive artists .

		His cogent argument is pleasant to read and by the aid of a large number of excellent illustrations is made easy to follow .

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	based his work on studies made in the Italian galleries during his many visits to
Italy	LOCATION	, and the illustrations represent the master - pieces of those great collections .

		A history of '' British Water-Colour Painting , '' at once comprehensive , authoritative , and readable , is that of Mr.
H. M. Cundall	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fifty illustrations , beautifully reproduced in color by the best modern methods , both elucidate Mr.
Cundall	PERSON	's descriptions and make of his book a sumptuous art volume .

		Mr.
Cundall	PERSON	does not lay claim to any fresh discoveries , but his classification of the artists in water-color in eleven distinctive categories gives a new turn to the mate - rial ; and his appendices , containing lists of members of five great British Societies of water-color artists , wUl be of great value to students .

		The arrange - ment is by groups , and in general is chronological .

		The first chapters are devoted to miniature paint - ers and topographical draughtsmen , two branches of art little practised in the nineteenth century .

		Gir - tin ,
Turner	PERSON	, and Constable , forerunners of the En - glish landscape painters , are discussed together in an interesting chapter .

		Another discusses '' The Influ - ence of Pre-Raphaelitism . ''

		Each Society is repre - sented by a chapter , and '' The Last Decade of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	'' speaks of
Whistler	LOCATION	, and , in a very general way , of the
Impressionistic School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sane and balanced judgment , and careful economy of space by judicious selection from a wide field are the best points about Mr.
Cundall	PERSON	's method .

		The high standard of excellence set in the earlier volumes of '' The Art Galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	'' series -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is fully maintained in `` The Art of the Netherland Galleries , '' by Mr.
David C. Preyer	PERSON	.

		Compelled by the nature of his material to adopt a method of treatment different from that followed in the rest of the series , the author , who is a Hollander by birth , has taken advantage of the circumstance that the great majority of the paint - ings in the galleries described are by Dutch artists , in order to present a complete history of Dutch art .

		Strange as it may seem , such a history has not be - fore appeared in English , nor in Dutch in the same completeness .

		Comparatively little information concerning the early painters is available , as most of their works perished during the two decades of the Spanish war and the fanatical outburst in
1566	DATE	known as the `` Image Storm . ''

		Even in the case of an artist so distinguished as
Lukas	PERSON	van
Leiden	LOCATION	, only one easel picture was saved .

		But from the middle of the sixteenth century onward , the mate - rial is ample , and the list of artists who are repre - sented in the galleries of their native land is a long one .

		Many of these men are known chiefly by their works , few biographical details concerning them having survived .

		Mr.
Preyer	PERSON	's account of these lesser men , as well as of their more noted fellows , is written with intelligence and discrimina - tion .

		The history is brought down to the present day , even the younger living artists being included in the purview .

		Following this section of the book , five chapters are devoted to `` Walks through the Galleries . ''

		There is also a useful bibliography and 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, an index .

		The illustrations , which are reproduced in a pleasing sepia tone , in duogravure work of fine quality , are as distinguished in their way as is the text .

		Accurate scholarship and painstaking workman - ship are manifest throughout `` A Short History of Engraving and Etching , '' by Mr.
A. M. Hind	PERSON	of the British Museum ,
Department of Prints and Drawings	ORGANIZATION	.

		The scope of the book is unusually wide .

		The history of the art is traced from its earliest beginnings , and the course of its develop - ment is followed through all the countries of
Europe	LOCATION	, even present-day etchers and engravers being included in the survey .

		The views expressed are sound and conservative , and fairly represent the consensus of well-informed opinion .

		Consider - ing the necessity for terse statement to keep the work within the limits of a single volume , the amount of information given is surprisingly large .

		Extended comment upon individual men is pre - cluded , only the more eminent artists being treated with any fulness ; but the inadequacy in this respect is more than offset by the extensive bibliographies and compendious indexes that are provided .

		The students and collectors for whose use , according to the title-page , the book has been prepared , will find these of great value .

		They occupy no less than a hundred and thirty-one of the book 's four hundred and seventy-three pages , and are alike admirable in substance and arrangement .

		The '' Classified List of Engravers '' supplies data about more than twenty - five hundred members of the craft , grouped by coun - tries .

		Following this is a '' General Bibliogi'aphy , '' which the author claims is more ample than any similar list attempted in any other publication .

		There is also an `` Index of Engravers and Indi - vidual Bibliographies '' which serves as a general index to the book .

		Coupled with the names of the engravers in this latter index are the titles of publi - cations containing information concerning them and their works , a feature that will be appreciated by every student having occasion to consult the list .

		A considerable number of well-chosen illustra - tions add to the attractions of a most useful book , which is issued in this country by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Cathedrals and Churches of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
T. Francis Bumpus	PERSON	, the latest publication in the `` Cathedral Series '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , might be described as an ornate hand-book , so closely does it combine the useful and the ornamental .

		An introductory chapter traces with unusual clearness the development of the cathedral from the Roman basilica .

		The remainder of the volume describes over one hundred cathedrals and churches , grouped according to location .

		A large mass of detail is condensed in the four hundred pages , for to com - ments on architecture , paintings , and mural decora - tions is added more or less of the history of build - ings , architects , and bishops .

		Most of the technical matter is clear enough to be easily understood by the novice in art-study ; and this is saying much for a writer who deals in apses , pilasters , ambons , bald - achinos , and such-like '' ecclesiological '' material .

		To the ordinary reader , however , and to students not intending an early pilgrimage to these shrines , the more general comments will appeal with greater force ; and these are many and valuable .

		The fail - ure of Italian architects to master the Pointed Gothic , the prevalence of great unfenestrated wall spaces , the scarcity of stained glass , and other pre - dominant features of Italian churches are logically accounted for .

		The book closes with a list of pictures and wall-paintings in the churches described , which will be a convenience to students .

		Over thirty photogravures are placed well for further elucida - tion of the text .

		The light covers with ecclesiasti - cal designs in red and gold , elaborate cover linings , and marginal traceries of sacred emblems around the illustrations , give the volume a sumptuous churchly look .

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have inaugurated a remarkably attractive series of '' Little Books on Art '' with four volumes -- '' Enamels , '' by Mrs.
Nelson Dawson	PERSON	; '' Miniatures , Ancient and Modern , '' and '' Jewelry , '' by Mr.
Cyril Davenport	PERSON	; and '' Book - plates , '' by Mr.
Edward Almack	PERSON	.

		Each volume is fully illustrated , the frontispiece being in color ; and their small size and simple but attractive bind - ing suggest their suitability as gifts for those whose interests centre in the artistic handicrafts .

		The text is necessarily general in scope , but it is in each case authoritative , comprehensive , and readable , -- in - tended for amateurs in search of accurate informa - tion which is not too technical for the amateur understanding .

		Books of Travel and Description .

		Lovers of Dr. van Dyke 's books -- and what reader of them is not a lover ?

		-- will rejoice that their number is increased by a record of the author 's recent journey to Palestine .

		The volume is entitled `` Out-of-doors in the Holy Land '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and is bound uniformly with others by the same author .

		The conventionalized design of the cover suggests the '' flowers of the field , '' and the unusually beauti - ful illustrations , in delicate pastel tints , are such as might adorn a much more expensive book .

		Dr.
van Dyke	PERSON	has discovered that `` Christianity is an out-of-doors religion , '' and journeys in the faith that '' the shut-in shrines and altered memorials are less significant than what we find in the open , among the streets and on the surrounding hill-sides . ''

		His `` impressions of travel in body and spirit '' -LRB- his sub-title -RRB- are therefore not heavy with human creeds and contentions , but breathe the spirit of the land itself .

		His writing always combines poetry , religion , and the love of nature , and this threefold felicity could not be more appropriately displayed than in celebrating the birthplace of Christianity .

		From the '' city that is lifted up '' to the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	, '' sleeping in still , forsaken beauty among the shelter - ing hills , and open to the cloudless sky which makes its water like a little heaven , '' his descriptions of

		THE DIAL .

		409 these long-loved places are at once refreshing and reverent .

		Psalm-like , unrhymed songs at the close of each chapter , beautiful enough to deserve publica - tion as a book of poems , recall '' The Welcome Tent , '' `` The Distant Road , '' `` The Unseen Altar , '' and other memories of the journey .

		If we can not quite apply the poet 's words to Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	and say of him that he has seen the mystery hid under
Egypt	LOCATION	's pyramid , we can at least admit that he has potently felt that mystery in his recent re-visit to the '' land of sand , and ruins , and gold , '' after an absence of fourteen years .

		In a large octavo , nothing short of luxurious in its appointments , entitled ''
Egypt	LOCATION	and its Monuments '' -LRB- The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , he writes of the pyramids and the sphinx , of the colossi of Memnon and the tombs of the kings , of
Cairo	LOCATION	and
Karnak	LOCATION	and
Luxor	LOCATION	and the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, with a rich accompaniment of full-page illustrations from the camera , and from the brush of Mr.
Jules Gu	PERSON	^ rin .

		The size of these illustrations , corresponding with the ample page and the large print , makes the book an impressive work of art .

		To be sure , the brilliant greens and yellows , reds and blues , of the reproduced paintings are a wide remove from nature and realism ; but probably they express the spirit and the spell of the scene better than do the severely literal photographs that accom - pany them .

		Of the sixty pictures , twenty are of Mr.
Gu	PERSON	^ rin 's execution and in his well-known style .

		The eighteen leisurely chapters of the volume have nothing suggestive of the guide-book about them .

		It is the fascination of the country , and not its hotels and routes of travel , that the author of '' The Garden of Allah '' has dwelt upon , and not a few of the thou - sands who now every year visit
Egypt	LOCATION	will find pleasure and stimulus in his pages .

		With that genially serious attention to minute details , that humorous circumstantiality in treating the commonplace , which we have all come to know so well and to like -LRB- or dislike -RRB- so heartily in Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, he has filled a substantial volume with his easily-flowing narrative of a Mediterranean vacation journey , naming his book '' Roman Holidays and Others '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The first landing of his party was made at
Madeira	LOCATION	, whence they proceeded to
Gibraltar	LOCATION	, and then to
Genoa	LOCATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, Leg - horn ,
Pisa	LOCATION	,
Genoa	LOCATION	again , and
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	.

		The style of the narrative -- if it is necessary to indicate it at all -- is well illustrated by the opening words of the second chapter : '' There is nothing strikes the traveller in his approach to the rock of
Gibraltar	LOCATION	so much as its resemblance to the trade-mark of the
Prudential Insurance Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		He can not help feeling that the famous stronghold is pictorially a plagiarism from the advertisements of that institu - tion . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	says of the present-day Romans that they have '' a republican simplicity of manner , and I liked this better in the shop people and work people than the civility overflowing into servility which one finds among the like folk , for instance , in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The great number of half-tone illustra - tions , done in a pleasing brownish tint that suggests etching , are a feature of the book , which in general appearance is uniform with Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's other recent volumes of travel and comment .

		`` The motor-car has restored the romance of travel . ''

		Thus alluringly does Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	begin her account of '' A Motor-Flight through
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		One may question the truth of her statement , feeling that a mad rush along dusty roads , past flying scenery and frightened peasants , has little of the '' restored '' charm of the old post-chaise .

		But the further one reads , the less he is inclined to dispute with Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	.

		Motoring may not strike the average person as a romantic means of transit , but she finds it so .

		It makes possible the quick transitions , the easy blotting out of non-essentials , in the fashion best suited to her impatient , restive , and luxury-loving temperament .

		It snatches her from a cathedral door , drops her before a chateau in the next village , blurs all impressions between save the few great moments , and leaves those distinct , etched on a background of flying clouds .

		It furnishes bird 's - eye views , salient yet subtle pictures , simple because their complexity is too deep to do more than fasci - nate the eye of '' the woman in the car . ''

		So , while most automobile tourists see nothing , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	, with a mind extraordinarily alert , sees the gist of everything , and fully justifies her initial hypothesis .

		Her sketches appeared originally in the ``
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	, '' of course without illustrations .

		In book form they are supplemented by a very generous allowance of excellent photographs , and the gain in readability is very great .

		Readers who enjoy style , readers who are fond of automobile riding , readers who are interested in rural
France	LOCATION	, whether for its art , its architecture , or its landscape , will enjoy Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's book .

		A sumptuous and -- what is more -- highly read - able volume entitled ``
Florida	LOCATION	Enchantments '' has been written by Messrs.
A. W.	PERSON	and
Julian A. Dimock	PERSON	, and published with almost innumerable illustrations from photographs , by the Outing Pub - lishing
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pictures , however , are not strictly numberless ; there are 120 of them , all large plates to match the generous pages of the book .

		Accounts of crocodile-hunting , tarpon-fishing , canoeing in the surf , searching for wild honey -LRB- and finding it -RRB- , crossing the everglades in a power boat , capturing a sea-cow , intercourse with the Seminoles , and other more or less thrilling adventures , fill the volume in a manner acceptable to the reader , adventurous or unadventurous .

		The book is not the inspiration of a moment . ''

		Florida the Fascinating , '' writes one of the authors at the beginning , '' cast the spell of her witchery upon me many years ago .

		I felt it then , I know it now .

		We were sailing , my family and I , up the lovely
Hermosassa	PERSON	and approaching the little islet which sentinels the small bay that fronts on
Tiger Tail Island	ORGANIZATION	, once the home of the famous Seminole , afterward the manor of the late
David L. Yulee	PERSON	, and at the time of which I write , a realized Utopia . ''

		The annual migration to
Florida	LOCATION	410 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, is at hand .

		The book would be an excellent one to read before going , or on the way , or even after arriving there .

		The Chinese character is a veritable Chinese puzzle to us , and any contribution toward its solu - tion is welcome .

		Mr.
J. Macgowan	PERSON	, of the
London	LOCATION
Missionary Society	ORGANIZATION	, and author of previous works on
China	LOCATION	, has given us , in his '' Sidelights on Chinese Life '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a series of informing and in - teresting chapters on such subjects as the family life of the people , child life , servants , amusements , the farmer , the mandarin , schools and school-masters and school-books , religious forces , the seamy side of Chinese life , and other matters of which he has intimate personal knowledge .

		The book is well made , has an outside wrapper of cloth , an agreeably flexible binding , and numerous illustrations -- twelve of them in color , the others in the familiar but ser - viceable half-tone .

		The colored views , landscapes ' chiefly , are so gaudily tinted as to be caricatures of nature , unless nature 's aspect in
China	LOCATION	is utterly unlike her appearance in western lands .

		In view of recent noteworthy occurrences in the
Celestial Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	, and the prospect of still more noteworthy ones to follow , this authoritative account of condi - tions there prevailing should minister to a natural and legitimate curiosity on the part of readers .

		A more readable book of travel than Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's '' Highways and Byways of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Macmillan -RRB- is not often published .

		Jour - neying with his camera from the Mexican to the Canadian frontier along the coast and as far inland as
Arizona	LOCATION	,
Nevada	LOCATION	, and
Idaho	LOCATION	, this experienced '' high - way and byway '' traveller and author has contrived to encounter a good many interesting experiences , to see many unusual sights , and to meet and talk with a number of highly original and entertaining characters .

		As in other volumes of the series , he has described the rurally picturesque and typical , and has avoided the urbanly conventional and unin - teresting .

		The difficulty of getting into close and vmconventional contact with the people , he has admirably surmounted , and his book abounds in racy talk from the unspoiled rustics he has met .

		This abundance of conversation gives his pages a human interest and an inviting appearance not found in the ordinary book of travel .

		To make his chapters more serviceable to intending travellers over the same route , Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	has continued his previous prac - tice of appending to each a useful note of desirable information .

		The sixty-three full-page illustrations from the author 's photographs are excellent ; and the binding and type are all that one could ask for in such a work .

		Much in the manner of her ''
Roma Beata	PERSON	'' and '' Two in
Italy	LOCATION	, '' Mrs.
Maud Howe Elliott	PERSON	has given her impressions of '' Sun and Shadow in
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in chapters that treat of
Gibraltar	LOCATION	,
Seville	LOCATION	,
Cordova	PERSON	,
Granada	LOCATION	,
Tangiers	LOCATION	,
Madrid	LOCATION	,
Toledo	LOCATION	, the
Carnival	ORGANIZATION	, the
King	PERSON	's wedding , and various other interesting matters , all profusely illustrated with half-tones and colored drawings .

		An abundance of conversation gives the pages an inviting appearance , while there is enough of serious attention to art and architecture and matters of his - toric interest to preserve the book from the charge of frivolity .

		It is pleasant to read , apropos of an incident illustrative of Spanish courtesy : '' I think this could not happen outside of
Spain	LOCATION	, the most democratic of all countries .

		Here every man is equal , not merely in the law 's eye , but -- what 's far more important -- in his own eyes , and proves it by allowing no other man to show , better manners than he . ''

		This speech is put into the mouth of one of the characters of the book .

		For promoting a more intimate understanding and a warmer friendship between Americans and Spaniards , this attractive picture of the land and its people is likely to do good service , besides affording considerable enter - tainment .

		Picturesque
Ireland	LOCATION	is very agreeably presented , with pen and camera , in Mr.
Plummer F. Jones	PERSON	's '' Shamrock-Land '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which has just enough of historical and statistical information to be useful without being tiresome , and a wealth of personal observation and experience that make excellent reading .

		The people , lively , emotional , keen of wit , receive sympathetic treatment at the author 's hands , and on the whole appear to be light - hearted , kindly disposed to all the world , and living their lives with admirable heartiness .

		Of the gentler sex we read : '' Perhaps no other women of the world have just that piquancy and vivacity of man - ner which characterizes the women of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		There is an animation , a force of manner , a spon - taneity of expression which makes them attractive in the extreme .

		One can not come in contact with them without feeling that with the proper environ - ments they might furnish the woi ` ld a type of the perfect woman . ''

		In seeking places of interest and scenes of beauty , of course the author visited
Lissoy	PERSON	-LRB- now better known as
Auburn	LOCATION	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	's Deserted Village -RRB- , the Lakes of
Killarney	LOCATION	,
Blarney Castle	ORGANIZATION	, the
Giant	ORGANIZATION	's Causeway , the
Golden Vale of Tipper	ORGANIZATION	- ary , and other inviting districts .

		Of the sorrows of
Ireland	LOCATION	he refrains from speaking , nor do they seem to have obtruded themselves very painfully upon him .

		There is much more of the sunshine of the Celtic temperament than of its occasional gloom in this study of Pat and his Emerald Isle .

		The pic - tures are excellent , as is in fact the entire workman - ship of the volume .

		Between the English '' trippers '' and the travel - ling Americans ,
England	LOCATION	is pretty well tourist - ridden ; so that Mr.
Henry C. Shelley	PERSON	's title for his book of sketches -- '' Untrodden English Ways '' -- provokes at once both interest and apprehension .

		Investigation proves the title , in some cases at least , unwarranted ; surely Bath , the Poets ' Corner at
Westminster	LOCATION	, and the graves of
Thackeray	PERSON	and of
George Eliot	PERSON	, are not unvisited by tourists .

		On the other hand ,
St. Ives	LOCATION	and its artist colony ,
Inver	LOCATION	- ary
Castle	ORGANIZATION	, Hursley with its relics of
John Keble	PERSON	, historic
Witney	PERSON	, and many other spots described

		THE DIAL 411 by Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	, are mere names to most travellers in
England	LOCATION	or to readers of books of English travel .

		Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's style is easy and readable , bespeaking intimate acquaintance both with the subject in hand and with the `` untrodden ways '' of English litera - ture .

		Pictures in color and line from the work of Mr.
H. C. Colby	PERSON	, and reproductions of photographs taken by the author , furnish a varied and beautiful adjunct to the text .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- General interest in the preservation of
Niagara Falls	ORGANIZATION	makes not untimely Mr.
Archer Butler Hul	PERSON	- bert 's elaborate descriptive and historical work on `` The Niagara River '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		By a reversal of what would seem to be the more natural method , he has , in his first six chapters , considered the Niagara of the present , with its problems and inter - ests , while in his concluding six he dwells on the history of the region and some of its heroes .

		His sixth chapter , '' A Century of Niagara Cranks , '' is an entertaining review of the many tight-rope - walking and cataract-shooting performances by which a raging thirst for fame has sought to assuage itself .

		Chapter V. , on '' Harnessing Niagara Falls , '' has an even greater interest -- to the practical , utilitarian mind .

		The illustrations throughout are good , the winter scenes being especially beautiful .

		The ample page permits most effective work of this sort .

		In mechanical execution , as well as in liter - ary style , the volume has decided merits .

		Standard Literature in
Holiday Form	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thoreau 's popularity as an author has greatly increased since he died in
1862	DATE	at the age of forty - four , with only two published books to his credit .

		Since then the publication of even his informal diaries , with all their imperfections of form and repetitions of thought , seems to indicate that the world can never have enough of that keen-witted Yankee dreamer of
Concord	LOCATION	.

		Emphatically worthy of this posthumous publication , however , was his ''
Cape Cod	PERSON	, '' which appeared in print three years after the writer 's death and has gone through many editions .

		An unusually attractive reprint of the work , prefaced and fully illustrated by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	, is now issued by
Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations , thirty-three in num - ber , are from photographs taken at different points along the identical route travelled by
Thoreau	PERSON	, and in the same month of
October	DATE	to which his descrip - tions mainly refer -- although his book was the fruit of more than one pilgrimage over those shifting sands .

		So delightfully slow of progress , so sturdUy tenacious of the tried and tested , are the good people of the
Cape	LOCATION	that we may safely assure ourselves that we are looking out , through Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's camera , on very much the same scenes as met
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's shrewdly observant scrutiny half a century ago .

		The typog - raphy of this edition is large and clear , a luxury to failing eyes ; and the binding is not only handsome , but strong and flexible .

		The charm of ''
Marjorie Daw	PERSON	'' was so irresistible when first she gleamed upon our sight -- a lovely apparition sent to be a moment 's ornament -- that the story was immediately translated into several foreign tongues and even enjoyed the honor of repub - lication in the Revue des Deux Mondes .

		That was a generation ago .

		Now , for the first time , and in suitable accompaniment to
Aldrich	PERSON	's biography , his little masterpiece appears in a volume by itself -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with colored illustrations by Mr.
John Cecil Clay	PERSON	.

		Heavy paper , wide margins , and very large type -LRB- great primer , or nearly that -RRB- combine to make a fairly large book out of the story -- which , as some may recall , was first printed in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' for
April , 1873	DATE	.

		The drawings would be better without the splashes of color ; but they help to a better conception of the characters , especially of the incorporeal heroine .

		It is surprising how long it took for ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, '' first published in
1869	DATE	, to struggle into anything like popularity .

		It had been on the mar - ket three years when a chance association or confu - sion of
Lorna	LOCATION	's name with that of the marquis who had lately wedded the much loved Princess
Louise	PERSON	brought the book into general notice and caused it to be read .

		It had been rejected , as
Blackmore	PERSON	himself has written , by all the magazines and by many publishers ; yet as soon as the great reading public became aware of its existence , the demand for it kept the printing-presses busy .

		The author 's account of the rise and prosperity of his masterpiece , as contained in his preface to the twentieth edition , is quoted in part by Mr.
H. Snowden Ward	PERSON	in his fifty-page introduction to the '' Doone-land edition , '' which is published in this country by the Harpers .

		Much has already been made known concerning this elaborate re-issue of the book , -- its topograhical and antiquarian and historical features , as supplied by the zealous editor 's pen ; and its equally elaborate pictorial embellishment , as furnished by the indus - trious Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's camera .

		It is hard to see how the work could have been better done .

		The numer - ous views , even the wide landscapes , have an admir - able clearness and finish .

		The editor 's lore will please the curious , and will be at least skimmed by the indifferent and careless .

		The exigencies of a one-volume edition have necessitated rather small type and a somewhat crowded page ; otherwise the appearance of the book is excellent .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons have anticipated the Poe centenary by issuing a sumptuous illustrated edition of the '' Complete Poems of
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, '' with a critical introduction by Professor
Charles F. Richardson	PERSON	, and pictures , reproduced in photogravure , as well as ornamental head-pieees and tail-pieces in line , by Mr.
Frederick Simpson Coburn	PERSON	.

		Nothing could be worse than
Poe	PERSON	badly illustrated ; but those who know Mr.
Coburn	PERSON	's style will feel no doubt of his competence .

		The simple , sensuous , mystical , yet picturesque quality of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's verse , its elegant aloofness , contrasted with its human thrill , are all suggested in the photogravures .

		The head - ings , symbolical or merely decorative , and a taste - ful cover design in gold , carry out the effect of decoration .

		412 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, A decidedly inviting edition of
Sterne	PERSON	's `` Senti - mental Journey , '' with an engraving of
Joshua Rey	PERSON	- nolds 's portrait of the author , and a great number of line drawings by Mr.
T. H. Robinson	PERSON	, comes from the press of
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The little story , without the impertinence of an introduction , has been so treated by printer and illustrator that it spins its slender length through 442 pages -LRB- including those that are blank and those that contain pictures only -RRB- , But it is meet that this leisurely stage-coach ramble through
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	should , in its telling , pre - sent no appearance of stress or hurry , or vulgar con - sideration of the value of economy , whether of time or space .

		The drawings are spirited , the print delightfully uncrowded and legible , and the binding is evidently designed for wear even more than for looks .

		To the '' Thumb-nail Series '' of small but dis - tinguished reprints
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	has this year added two titles --
Keats	PERSON	's '' Odes , Sonnets , and Lyrics , '' with a preface by
Edmund Clarence Sted	PERSON	- man and a note by Mr.
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	; and
Emerson	PERSON	's essays on Power , Success , and Great - ness , with an introductory appreciation , also by Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	.

		Both volumes have portrait frontis - pieces , and embossed leather covers specially designed for them by Mrs.
Blanche McManus Mansfield	PERSON	.

		The newest volume in the `` English Idylls '' series , with a dainty binding and colored illustrations after designs by Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	, is Miss
Austen	PERSON	's `` Mansfield Park '' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- .

		This is the fourth of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's novels to be reprinted in the series , for which their old-time humor , with its wide scope for the illustrator 's art , makes them particularly well suited .

		Miscellaneous Gift Books .

		It is dangerous to use superlatives about any particular holiday book , especially this year when the publishers have vied with one another , as it seems , to produce luxurious effects .

		But if not the most sumptuous , one of the most sumptuous and artistic publications of the season is '' The Book of the Pearl '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume is royal quarto size , and the cover-design shows a net-work of gold filagree inset with pearls .

		The illustrations , of which there are over one hundred , are in photogravure , color , tint , and black-and-white .

		They include por - traits of famous women wearing superb pearls , pic - tures of crown jewels , of notable stones , and of jewels with unusual settings or adapted to unusual uses , be - sides scenes from the pearl fisheries throughout the world .

		The text is the joint production of Dr.
George Frederick Kunz	PERSON	and Dr.
Charles Hugh Stevenson	PERSON	, one the gem expert of
Tiffany & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the other a statistician of acknowledged authority .

		It touches upon every conceivable phase of the sub - ject : the artistic uses of pearls in all ages ; their pictorial values ; all obtainable facts and many theories concerning their origin , growth , and struc - ture ; their commercial value ; their mystical and medicinal properties ; the proper way to preserve their beauty ; the history of the pearl-fishing indus - try in all parts of the world and its methods ; the necessity of husbanding the natural resources for pearls and the possibilities of their artificial culture .

		In short , there is nothing to know about pearls that may not be found somewhere in the six hundred pages of '' The Book of the Pearl . ''

		Encyclopaedic in character , and representing an appalling amount of the most laborious research , the book is neverthe - less thoroughly readable -- a strong proof of the patience and genuine interest of the authors in their work .

		It would doubtless require a very strong interest in the subject to cause any reader to go through the whole book in sequence ; but whatever the ground of his attraction to the pearl he can find much to elucidate it , and once having begun to read it is safe to say that he will not soon stop .

		The his - tory of the pearl fisheries reads like a romance .

		The account of the supposedly mystical qualities of the queen of gems , from the first reference in the
Atharvaveda	LOCATION	, at least
2400 years ago	DATE	, to the al - most contemporary recommendation of pearls as a medicinal cure-all , by a native Indian prince , makes a fascinating chapter .

		Readers who do not care for mysticism may turn to the following chapter , a very practical account of the money-value of pearls .

		No more beautiful gift than this could be desired , either for lovers and owners of pearls , or for lovers of fine book-making .

		An imposing quarto over which a lover of gardens might dream by day or night is entitled '' Gardens Old and New , '' and is the third in the series called ''
The Country House	ORGANIZATION	and its Garden Environment '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The work is , first of all , a gallery of garden views , and contains about four hundred half - tones from photographs by Mr.
Charles Latham	PERSON	, many of them full-page in size and all of them fas - cinating in subject .

		The thirty gardens chosen for this royal noticing are either English or Welsh , and are situated between
Newton Ferrers	ORGANIZATION	,
Cornwall	LOCATION	, and
Bramham Park	LOCATION	,
Yorksliire	PERSON	.

		To make it possible for stay-at-homes to imagine truly the historic box-maze and ancient cedars of
Wilton	LOCATION	, the Italian terraces of Bowood , the immemorial yews of
Gayhurst	LOCATION	, the rose garden of Treworgey , the gorgeous parterres of
Holland House	ORGANIZATION	, the broad lawns across which rise the turrets of
Hatfield	ORGANIZATION	, and many other scenes of delight , -- this is what these pictures accomplish .

		The text , though subordinate , is not at all a mere sign-post .

		An introduction , presumably by the editor , Mr.
H. Avray Tipping	PERSON	, records the characteristics of English gardens both humble and aristocratic from the time when
Markham	PERSON	timidly suggested the separ - ation of flowers and vegetables because '' your Gar - den flowers shall suffer some disgrace if among them you intermingle Onions , Parsnips '' etc. , through the times when `` Capability ''
Brown	PERSON	destroyed the beautiful past to make room for his '' artificially natural serpentines , '' up to the present , with its encouraging harmony of nature and art .

		The chap - ters supply much information about the architecture of the houses and the history of the families who
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		413 occupy them , besides pointing out detailed beauties of the gardens which might otherwise escape obser - vation .

		The volume is bound in dark blue cloth with elaborate Renaissance decorations in gilt , and forms a notable addition to garden literature .

		In a lavishly illustrated quarto which he en - titles '' Historic Houses and their Gardens '' -LRB-
John Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Charles Francis Osborne	PERSON	has brought together descriptions of over thirty of the world 's most famous dwelling-places , from Tokio to
Mount Vernon	LOCATION	.

		A brief introduction by Mr.
Frank Miles	PERSON	Day states some principles of garden archi - tecture which are worth remembering .

		Mr.
P. H. Ditchfield	PERSON	contributes six of the chapters , and some twenty writers furnish the others ; so that the essays are interesting from variety of personal predilec - tion and view-point as well as subject .

		A scholarly study of ancient Roman country houses , elucidated by many sketches , is supplied by Professor
Hamlin	PERSON	of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, and an ingenious compar - ison of the mediaeval and modern plans of the
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	gardens is made by Mr.
Havell	PERSON	.

		National characteristics shown in landscape gardening are pointed out in chapters on Indian , Persian , and Mexican gardens -- such , for example , as the pre - eminence of the Grand Moguls in '' the art of plan - ning and planting gardens in direct harmonious relation to the house , palace , or mausoleum to which they belonged . ''

		The descriptions are all brief , occupying much less space than the illustrations .

		Whether accidentally or not , it has come about that those of English places ,
Blenheim	ORGANIZATION	,
Moor Park	LOCATION	,
Claydon	PERSON	,
Stowe	PERSON	, and
Warwick	PERSON	, are given almost wholly to the houses , their histories and occupants , while those of Italian and Spanish villas are chiefly concerned with the gardens .

		And no wonder these gardens monopolize attention !

		The only wonder is that people who could wander through such vistas as the pictiires show , beside such fountains and parterres , and feast their eyes on such visions of distant mountain and valley , should ever have cared to build houses at all .

		Would anyone who found his feet on the hedged ramps of vine-clad terraces of the
Villa Lante	LOCATION	, or among the mosses and ferns of the
Villa D'Este	LOCATION	, where `` man has created where Nature does not provide , but with Nature as his perception , '' ever care to enter even a palace in which '' there are servants and furniture '' ?

		Yet when one comes to think of them , these lordly pleasure palaces all have their own beauty , ranging from the ornate harmony of the Spanish arcade and the airy lightness of the Indian pavilion to the gray solidity of the English keep .

		The book will bring travellers ' joy , whether reminiscent or imaginary , to those who turn its pages .

		A series of unusual distinction , both in subject - matter and as examples of artistic book-making , is '' The New Mediaeval Library '' of
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The series makes its advent this fall with five volumes .

		Its object is to offer reprints , in translation , of the choicest mediaeval romances and other interesting works , especially those that are little known to modern readers .

		The mediaeval note is emphasized by the antique style of binding , in brown pigskin with metal clasps .

		The texts are clearly printed on pure linen paper , and illustrated with photogravure or wood-cut reproductions of the original illustrations contained in old editions of the work reprinted .

		But the mechanical perfection of the series is no more alluring than befits the delight - ful works chosen for reprint , and the fine and dis - criminating quality of the editorial work and the translation . ''

		Of the Tumbler of Our Lady , and Other Miracles '' has been translated from the Middle French , with a sympathetic introduction , by Miss
Alice Kemp-Welch	PERSON	.

		Miss
Kemp	PERSON	-
Welch	PERSON	is also the translator of the fifteenth century French romance by
Christine de Pisan	PERSON	, '' The Book of the Duke of True Lovers , '' The ballads which occur in the old tale are translated in the original metres by Messrs.
Laurence Binyon	PERSON	and
Eric R. D. Mac	PERSON	- lagan .

		`` The Chatelaine of Vergi , '' a thirteenth century romance , also translated by Miss
Kemp	PERSON	-
Welch	PERSON	, is short enough so that the original French text has been reprinted after the translation .

		Mr.
L. Brandin	PERSON	furnishes a delightful introduction for this volume . ''

		The Legend of the
Holy Fina	ORGANIZATION	, Virgin of
Santo Gimignano	ORGANIZATION	'' is a thirteenth-century Italian legend chronicled by
Fra Giovanni di Coppo	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is translated and furnished with preface and notes by Mr.
M. Mansfield	PERSON	.

		Quaintest of all , perhaps , is `` The Babees ' Book : Mediaeval Manners for the Young , '' done into modern English from Dr.
Furni	PERSON	- vall 's texts by Miss
Edith Rickert	PERSON	.

		These curious codes of good behavior form the intricate basis for the whole fabric of the mediaeval romances , so that their intrinsic human interest is heightened by their relation to the social organization and the literature of their time .

		Each of these little books will be treasured by those who appreciate rare things , culled in literary by-paths and fittingly presented .

		That
Madame Mary King Waddington	ORGANIZATION	knows her
Paris	LOCATION	perfectly , we have already learned from her `` Letters of a Diplomat 's Wife . ''

		That she also knows her rural
France	LOCATION	almost as well is now made clear in a fresh book of very agreeable descrip - tion and anecdote , entitled '' Chateau and Country Life in
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Sojourns at various country places in different parts of
France	LOCATION	are described in the author 's now well-known style ; and illustrations , sketchy and suggestive rather than de - tailed and finished , help to place us amid the scenes and characters successively chosen for our entertain - ment .

		As a sample of the book 's quality , this pass - ing pen-portrait of the dowager
Comtesse de Florian	ORGANIZATION	, at whose chateau on the outskirts of Valognes the writer was hospitably entertained , is good : `` She does n't take much interest in the outside world , nor in anything that goes on in other countries , but is too polite to show that when she talks to me , for instance , who have knocked about so much .

		She does n't understand the modern life , so sans gene and agitated , and it is funny to hear her say , when talk - ing of people she does n't quite approve of , ' lis ne 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, sont pas de notre monde . ' ''

		Speaking of the pres - ent Marquis de
Lafayette	LOCATION	, great-grandson of the famous
Lafayette	LOCATION	, she says : '' There is something in perfectly well-bred French people of a certain class that one never sees in any other nationality .

		Such refinement and charm of manner -- a great desire to put every one at their ease and to please the person with whom they are thrown for the moment . ''

		It is the human element in Mme. Wad - dington 's book , rather than her references to archi - tecture and landscape , that makes it especially enjoyable .

		To Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	the love affairs of cele - brated characters are extremely important and worthy of the minutest study and the most pains - taking research .

		The follies of their unguarded moments shall not be suffered to lapse into chari - table oblivion if he can help it .

		Having already given us the details of
Madame de Stall	ORGANIZATION	's and of George Sand 's unlicensed loves , he now selects still another French character for similar treatment . ''


Rousseau	PERSON	and the Women he Loved '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a substantial octavo of nearly five hundred pages , admirably printed , and adorned with two portraits of Jean-Jacques himself and with five of women to whom he felt sentimentally inclined .

		Justification for this new life in English of one whom Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	-LRB- as we still like to call his lordship -RRB- has made the subject of an excellent biographical study , is sought for in the recent discovery and publica - tion , by certain delvers in French archives and private papers , of many letters and other documents that throw new light on the philosopher 's idiosyn - crasies and demonstrate the palpable untruth of cer - tain portions of his own autobiography .

		If one is interested in
Rousseau	PERSON	's life -- and who can help being more or less interested ?

		-- it is better to have the real facts than falsehoods ; and so Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	has rendered a not unuseful service .

		The fresh-looking green covers of Mr.
Stanton Davis Kirkham	PERSON	's `` In the Open '' -LRB- Elder -RRB- give promise of a spring-like quality in the book Avhich the reading of it finds fulfilled .

		The author is quite capable of the more wintry acumen of scientific pre - cision , as is proved by his remarkable account of a battle between red and black ants .

		But one feels that the scientific spirit is secondary with him and that his mood is first of all that of gentle responsive - ness to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's '' perpetual invitation . '' ''

		To count among his friends the birds and flowers and trees '' is his ambition .

		Through intimate companionship he reaches a power of delicate characterization unique even among trained nature-lovers .

		To his eye the beech in the winter woods is a '' stripped athlete , every muscle and sinew in evidence '' ; the stones of a
New England	LOCATION	pasture '' are almost as individual in appearance as men . ''

		To his ear '' the brook seems as if inhabited by a number of spirits throughout its length , some whispering , some laugh - ing , others singing . ''

		He feels in the forest '' imper - turbable calm , that stable equilibrium of the granite ledge and the great tree trunks '' ; and adds , '' the forest has its luxuries , and they consist , in a meas - ure , of freedom from those things considered lux - uries in the city . ''

		In the moimtains , he says , '' one would better wander alone , for in our deepest moments the mountains are company enough . ''

		His readers will often pay him the subtle compli - ment of exclaiming , '' That is just what I have thought . ''

		The book has several dainty half-tone illustrations , and a beautiful frontispiece , after a painting by
Louis Agassiz Fuertes	PERSON	, which fixes in color that vision never clearly enough seen in real life , a wedge of wild geese in full flight .

		No city in
America	LOCATION	is richer in historic associar tions than
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Mary Caroline Crawford	PERSON	, already known for her studies in
New England	LOCATION	his - tory and antiquities , has prepared a work , full of zealous research and written in an agreeable style , on '' St.
Botolph	PERSON	's Town '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is especially the human and personal element that appeals to her in reviewing the past , and so she has given considerable space to
Winthrop	LOCATION	and Vane , to
Samuel Sewall	PERSON	and the two
Mathers	ORGANIZATION	, to
Anne Hutch	PERSON	- inson and
Dorothy Quincy	PERSON	, and to other picturesque or otherwise interesting characters of that olden time . ''

		History , '' she says in her preface , '' seems to me worse than useless unless it illustrates the times of which it writes as those times affected the lives of its men and women .

		A book like this has no justi - fication , to my mind , save as it makes us understand just a little better the part
New England	LOCATION	, in the person of its chief town , has played in the mighty drama of nations made up of thinking , feeling men and women . ''

		The many illustrations from old paint - ings and engravings reproduce the persons and places treated , and a map of
1722	DATE	strikingly demonstrates how little of the present city stands upon soil that was in existence when the waters were gathered together unto one place and the dry land appeared .

		The book is clearly printed on substantial paper of a creamy yellow tint , and the binding is appropriately decorated .

		For moral uplift and sane optimism , Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	's essays are of acknowledged excellence .

		In a little volume called '' Counsels by the Way '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- are reprinted nine of his best productions of this sort , selected from the still smaller booklets that the same publishers have brought out in the last few years , and that have met with deserved favor .

		A prefatory note explains that '' the little gift books containing single essays may still be had as for - merly , '' but that requests for a single volume suit - able for the library has induced the publishers to issue the present collection .

		The subject matter of the several essays is indicated by the titles , -- `` Pilgrims of the Sea , '' `` Whither Bound ? ''

		`` The Haven of Work , '' `` The Haven of Character , '' `` The Last Port , '' `` The Poetry of the Psalms , '' `` Joy and Power , '' `` The Battle of Life , '' and '' The Good Old Way . ''

		The book is well printed and of pleasing aspect .

		`` My Lady of the Fog '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is one of Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	's characteristically light
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 415 and whimsical romances .

		Beginning four or five years ago with ''
Kitty	PERSON	of the Roses , '' Mr.
Barbour	PERSON	has written a novelette a year , each more original in plot and better finished than its predecessors .

		The '' Lady of the Fog '' is lost off the coast from
Gloucester	LOCATION	, and rescued by a stranger , who is , as it turns out , an employee in one of her mines in the
West	LOCATION	.

		And in the end the foreign count who has been looking for an heiress finds that he has to look further .

		Twelve illustrations in color , by Mr.
Clarence F. Underwood	PERSON	, and dainty page borders , also in color , by Mr.
Edward Stratton HoUoway	PERSON	, make the story the prettiest possible sort of Christmas remembrance .

		One can not see the title of Miss
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	's recent volume , ''
Browning	PERSON	's England '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- without thinking of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's `` Shakespeare 's
England	LOCATION	, '' and wondering if the new book is analogous to the old .

		As a matter of fact , there is scarcely any resemblance between the two , for
Miss Clarke	PERSON	's is a book of literary criticism pure and simple .

		This is confined to poems which are at least partly English in inspiration -- hence the title ; and as their number is considerable and most of them are quoted entire , the volume is of appreciable size .

		Studies which furnish new and valuable material are made of such subjects as these : the poet 's early adoration of Shelley and
Keats	PERSON	; his feeling toward
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and toward Shake - speare ; the historical background of '' Strafford , '' and the social aspect of '' A Blot in the ` Scutcheon '' ; the relations which various Englishmen bear to some of the poems --
Alfred Domett	PERSON	to ''
Waring	PERSON	, ''
Bunyan	PERSON	to ''
Ned Bratts	PERSON	, '' and so forth .

		A charm - ing portrait of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	serves as frontispiece , and numerous illustrations recall the persons and places mentioned .

		With `` The Open Road , '' `` The Friendly Town , '' and `` The Gentlest Art , '' Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	has achieved an enviable position as artistic compiler .

		This year he has edited '' The Ladies ' Pageant '' -LRB- MacmiUan -RRB- , a collection , as delightful as the rest that he has made , of feminine portraits , real and fictitious .

		As usual , the captions for the various groups -- '' The ' Buds , '' '' Daughters of
Erin	PERSON	, '' `` Wayside Flowers , '' `` Good Company , '' `` Saints , '' `` The Blues , '' `` Aunts and Grandmothers , '' `` The Tyrants , '' and so on -- give an individual quality to the small volume .

		The theme offers plenty of scope for variety , and there is no lack of that quality in Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's book , the selections in which are cuUed from all imaginable sources , both in prose and poetry .

		The Roman villas , '' asleep in lap of legends old , '' have been chosen by Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	for the latest volume in what might be called her romance-of-turrets-and-towers series .

		An earlier work of hers -LRB- '' Romance of the Italian Villas '' -RRB- dealt with famous villas outside of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Now her '' Romance of Roman Villas '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- presents , with a generous embellishment of song and story , the historic villas of the sacred city itself , of the Renaissance period .

		`` Still unrivalled , '' she says in her introduction , '' after the lapse of four cen - turies the villas of the great cardinals of the
Renais	PERSON	- sance retain their supremacy over their Italian sisters , not , as once , by reason of their prodigal magnificence , but in the appealing charm of their picturesque decay . ''

		Her book is a highly orna - mented , profusely illustrated , handsomely printed volume of almost four hundred pages .


Maeterlinck	PERSON	's poetic drama , '' Pelleas and Mdl - isande , '' appears in a new edition -LRB-
Crowell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with pictures in color and half-tone .

		These are repro - ductions of photographs representing scenes from the Debussy opera on the same theme , as it was first presented in
New York	LOCATION	with
Miss Mary Garden as Mflisande	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translation is that of Mr.
Erving Winslow	PERSON	, and an introduction by Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	puts the reader in touch with
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's point of view and with this particular example of his work , and explains the relation between it and
Claude Debussy	PERSON	's music-drama .

		Colored page bor - ders lend an additional decorative touch to the new edition .

		Readers of '' Life , '' '' Puck , '' and `` Judge '' will recall the clever nonsense verses of Mr.
Thomas Ybarra	PERSON	, often accompanied by Mr.
Hy	PERSON	.


Mayer	PERSON	's humorous drawings to give an added zest to their absurdities .

		Some of the verses have now been collected in a small volume entitled ''
Davy Jones	PERSON	's Yarns , and Other Salted Songs '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .


Davy Jones	PERSON	is a delicious caricature of the
Ancient Mariner	ORGANIZATION	, with many mad adventures to relate .

		The Swiss Admiral , the Mince Pu * ates , the Cuban Rev - olution Bug , and the Icecreamberg , figure conspic - uously in the five '' Yarns . ''

		The '' Salted Songs '' are in similar vein , with a fantastic quality in their humor that is as unusual as it is delightful .

		The pictures , which are printed in two colors , are a dis - tinct attraction .

		A collection of brief essays on various things that make up the fascination of city life -- beauty , human interest , fellowship , opportunities , holiday-making , the charms of a great past and a glorious future -- written by Mr.
Charles Mulford Robinson	PERSON	, appears from the press of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	with the expressive title '' The Call of the
City	LOCATION	. ''

		The book is beautifully printed on handmade , deckle - edged paper , with a photogravure frontispiece and a novel binding .

		Verses , selected with the same discrimination and originality that mark the style of the essays , appear as headings for the prose .

		`` The Christmas Book '' -LRB-
Griffith & Rowland Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Jane A. Stewart	PERSON	, is full of informa - tion about the origin of the universal holiday , and its characteristic sports and observances in this land and many others .

		There are also two Christmas exercises for children and some suggestions for home-made Christmas gifts .

		Illustrations , some of them in color , decorative headings , gay end papers and cover design , add a Christmas touch to the appearance of a book that is full of the Christmas spirit .

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a new translation , by Sir
Clements Markham	PERSON	, of that famous picaresque novel , `` The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes . ''

		Considerable edi - torial apparatus goes with the translation , and there are numerous illustrations . ''

		The Origin and
Early Development	ORGANIZATION	of the English Universities to the Close of the
Thirteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Earnest Vancourt Vaughn	PERSON	, is an important study in educational history , now published in the `` Social Science Series '' of the
University of Missouri	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Poems of
New England	LOCATION	'' is a reissue , in a single volume , of that section of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' Poems of Places '' which relate to the
New England	ORGANIZATION	country .

		The compilation is now thirty years old , but it is well worth bringing before the attention of the new genera - tion .

		It is published , of course , by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish ''
Panseron	PERSON	's A B C of Music , '' as revised and extended by Mr.
N. Clifford Page	PERSON	.

		This little book is a primer of vocalization by a musician who died half a century ago , and it has long been favorably known as an elementary text .

		Its first American edition dates from
1846	DATE	, and has had a wide circulation .

		The first two volumes of a new '' Readers ' Library , '' published by the
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and edited by Messrs.
W. J. and C. W. Dawson	PERSON	, are devoted to '' The Great English Letter Writers , '' and give us a classified selection of examples from a wide range of authors .

		Considerable ingenuity has been exercised by the editors in bringing together letters from widely scattered sources under such suggestive and alluring categories 420 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, as `` Tribulations of Genius , '' `` Pocket Philosophies , '' '' By-gone Lovers , '' and '' The Artist and His Art . ''

		Future volumes in this attractive series are to be devoted to essayists , historians , nature-lovers , `` accusers , '' and other interesting groups .

		The `` Dictionary of Quotations , '' compiled by Mr.
Norman MacMunn	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a small volume of '' extracts old and new from writers of all ages '' -- too small a volume , in fact , to be of much use in running down any given quotation , although it may benefit the writer in search of an appropriate text for some discourse .

		To reduce '' Les Mis ^ rables '' to text-book dimensions , allowing space for much editorial matter and a fairly complete vocabulary , means pruning of a rather merci - less sort , and we are not sure that we consider the task worth undertaking .

		However , it has been performed by Dr.
Douglas L. BufEum	PERSON	, and the work is now issued for school use by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Three Grerman texts just published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following :
Moser	PERSON	's `` Ultimo , '' edited by Professor
Charles L. Crow	PERSON	;
Moser	PERSON	's '' Der Bibliothekar , '' edited by Professor
HoUon A. Farr	PERSON	; and
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	's ''
Lotti	PERSON	, die
Uhrmach	PERSON	- erin , '' edited by Professor
George H Needier	PERSON	.

		The
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish ''
Fritz auf Ferien	PERSON	, '' by the writer who calls herself ''
Hans Arnold	PERSON	, '' edited by Miss May Thomas .

		Almost the last piece of literary work from the pen of the late Professor Charles
Eliot Norton	PERSON	, if not quite the last , was the writing of an Introductory Note for a new edition of the famous stories of
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	, whose work Mr.
Norton	PERSON	admired , believing that the pictures of good breeding and pleasant manners of their time can not fail to have a helpful influence on the young people of to-day .

		The volume is edited by that veteran purveyor of children 's literature , Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, and is published by
Messrs. H. M. Caldwell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	with the title '' Tales That Never Die . ''

		One of the most impressive peace documents ever prepared is Pastor
Frenssen	PERSON	's story of ''
Peter Moor	PERSON	's Journey to
Southwest Africa	LOCATION	, '' which is a plain narra - tive , in the first person , of the experiences of a private soldier in the inglorious German campaign .

		It is the naked reality of warfare , not its blaze and glory , that confronts us in these pages , and no one can read them , we should think , without taking their lesson to heart .

		The translation , which is authorized , has been made with exceptional skill by Miss
Margaret May Ward	PERSON	, and the little book is published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Herr Axel Olrik	PERSON	is one of the most learned and in - dustrious modern students of the civilization and liter - ature of the old Scandinavian peoples , and already has a dozen or more works to his credit .

		His latest book is a condensed account of '' Nordisk Aandsliv i Vikinge - tid og Tidlig Middelalder . ''

		Beginning with the age of the myth-makers , this monograph carries the story of the
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	's spiritual life down to the early Christian era and to the time of the folk-songs .

		The work is beautifully prmted and illustrated .


Herr Olrik	PERSON	has also issued a new edition of his selection of ''
Danske Folkeviser	PERSON	, '' with an extensive introduction and notes adequate to the purpose of the work , which is especially planned for the use of Danish schools .

		Both these pub - lications come to us from the
Gyldendalske Boghandel	PERSON	,
Copenhagen	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		NOTES 468 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 469 THE COPYRIGHT QUESTION .

		Sometime during the coming year , the story of `` The Celebrated Jumping Frog '' will be removed from the protection of our law of copy - right and become the prey of the irresponsible publisher .

		Its aged but still sprightly author will have no legal means of preventing anyone from reproducing , in any form that may suggest itself , even a form inaccurate and mutilated , this pleasant tale of the guileful stranger who took a mean advantage of his unsuspecting fellow - countryman .

		The case is of no consequence in itself , but is typically important because it illus - trates a great wrong done by American law - makers to the profession of American authorship .

		The author of this particular bit of writing was among those who went to
Washington	LOCATION	two years ago to plead with
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for a fairer system of copyright protection , and was welcomed as a humorist , but treated with indifference as a champion of the rights of literary property .

		Briefly stated , the grievance is simply that every American author who lives to the age of seventy or thereabouts must see his earlier writings pass out of his control , and his income from their sale become a vanishing quantity .

		The present decade has witnessed the expiration , during the author 's lifetime , of copyright upon important works by
Stedman	PERSON	,
Aldrich	PERSON	,
Norton	LOCATION	, Dr.
Mit	PERSON	- chell ,
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	, and Mr.
Howells	PERSON	.

		In this respect we are far behind the rest of the civilized world , for most countries respect an author 's rights in his own books as long as he lives and for a considerable term of years after his death .

		This is only one of many defects in our tangled copjT-ight legislation , but it is a particularly sali - ent one because of the personal injustice which it so clearly works .

		We consider the principle of perpetual copyright , although logically sound , to be of academic interest only ; for we believe that substantial justice wovdd be done by pro- tecting literary property during the author 's life - time and for one or two generations beyond .

		To secure such protection should be the primary aim of the
American Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	, which is about to renew its demands upon the national legislature .

		The League may have seemed mori - bund during the years since
1891	DATE	, when its 444 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, efforts brought about the imperfect although considerable triumph of International Copy - right , but its Council has been doing a good deal of quiet work all the time , and the activities which it now plans will not constitute a new departure .

		The membership of the
League	ORGANIZATION	is now being reorganized , '' so that the full force of American authorship may come to the sup - port of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	, and that many authors who have achieved distinction in the last twenty years may have the honor and responsibility of contributing to the improvements in the pres - ent statute . ''

		\ The failure to protect authors in their liter - ary rights during their own lifetime and that of their immediate descendants is one of the two major evils of our copyright law as it now exists .

		The other is the '' manufacturing clause '' in the act granting copyright protection to foreign authors .

		To say that an Englishman shall have no rights under our law to the product of his brain until that product shall be put into mar - ketable form by American labor , is precisely like saying that the same Englishman , landing in
New York	LOCATION	, shall have no right to personal protection against violence until he has pur - chased American-made garments and clothed himself therein .

		Looked at in this light , the sheer economic waste of the duplicate type - setting becomes a less important aspect of the evil than the downright wrong done the indi - vidual by this piratical demand .

		We are well aware that without the acceptance of this obnox - ious requirement the Act of
1891	DATE	would have failed of its passage , and as a temporizing ex - pedient , resorted to for the sake of securing an instalment of equity , we were willing to justify it .

		But every friend of fair dealing is bound to lift up his voice , in and out of season , to protest against a supine acceptance of this condition as a part of any final settlement .

		It is a compro - mise essentially revolting to the sense of inter - national justice .

		We could wish that the agitation for copy - right reform might be narrowed down to the discussion of the above two evils only , until they were effectively remedied ; but this wish would be futile .

		We may reasonably hope for an extension of the term of copyright , but there is little immediate likelihood of our giving more than the present half-measure of justice to the foreign author .

		The unholy alliance of special interests which has made '' protection '' a syno - nym for '' oppression '' is too firmly in control of the law-making machinery to allow us to hope that the grip of its typographical tentacle will be loosened in the near future .

		There seems to be nothing for it but to keep on tem - porizing , and work for improvements in small matters , while the large question of principle is left for another generation to settle .

		But we repeat that this large question should never be lost sight of , and that its equitable settlement should be the underlying aim of all who honestly work for a more enlightened law in copyright affairs .

		Among the reforms just now thought prac - ticable by the League are an extension of the term of copyright , the abolition of the manu - facturing clause in its application to foreign languages 07ily , the establishment of penalties for violations of copyright and stageright , the protection of copyrights assigned to corporations , the simplification of certain details of the law as now existing , the abolition of the disfiguring copyright notice on works of art , and the recog - nition of the rights of composers in mechanical reproductions of their music .

		The whole ques - tion of copyright legislation is exceedingly com - plicated , and is becoming more so all the time .

		The problem last named in the above list has been injected into the discussion very recently , and has made a great deal of trouble .

		It was the opposition of the mechanical music pirates that mdlified the efforts of the League two years ago , when a determined attempt was made to induce
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to amend and rationalize our law of copyright .

		We presume that the com - poser ought to be protected against the manufac - ture of mechanical devices for the reproduction of his music , but we wish that his grievance , so comparatively new , might be separated from the long-standing grievance of the authors ' guild , and dealt with on its own accoimt .

		That it may not be thus distinguished means simply that a new '' vested interest '' joins hands with the old ones in opposition to the rights of intellectual workers , and makes their prospects seem darker than ever before .

		Probably some of the reforms now urged by the
League	ORGANIZATION	will be effected by its activity .

		We may perhaps get , instead of a few patches here and there , a general revision and codifica - tion of the entire body of law relating to intel - lectual property .

		This is an aim worth working for , even if the law should remain bad in some of its essential features .

		As matters no `` v stand , only an expert -LRB- and he not always -RRB- can tell what the law is upon many points .

		It may be a necessary preliminary to the securing of a wise and just law that we should first be enabled to get a clear view of the law that we actually
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 445 have .

		At all events , it is clear that much work remains to be done , and it is work in which every American author should take an interest , which means , among other things , contributing both money and personal effort to the campaign now about to be inaugurated anew .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Some idiosyncrasies of Sardou have been recalled by his friends since his death .

		That he had an eagerly acquisitive and -LRB- in a good sense -RRB- inquisitive mind , need not surprise us . ''

		You should have watched him turning the leaves of a book , '' says one who knew him , '' or scrutinizing a picture .

		Thoughts , ideas , images he devoured .

		He trans - formed them and made them his own . ''

		In his youth , when , poor and often in need of food , he roamed about
Paris	LOCATION	seeking employment , it seemed as if nothing unusual could happen without his being on the spot to see it ; and he was also an indefatigable questioner of those who had been eye-witnesses of memorable events beyond his reach . ''

		I have heard him tell of his meeting with Mme. de Metternich , '' writes another friend . ''

		As soon as he knew of her presence in the house where he was a guest , he hastened to interrogate her .

		He asked for her recol - lections of
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	, of the
Vienna	LOCATION	treaty , of ' I ` Aiglon * ; then he asked whether
Metternich	PERSON	was wont to talk much about the emperor , and burned to find out what he had said of him .

		That is how he came by the anecdotes he used to relate with such spirit . ''

		Still another friend , visiting the great dramatist in his illness , found him distressed at his inability to work .

		• ■ ' All the same , '' he cried abruptly , * ' I have strength enough to reply to the wretch who has been guilty , in an article on
Beaumarchais	LOCATION	, of saying that when the author of '
Figaro	PERSON	' came to
Paris	LOCATION	he lived in the third house on the left of the boulevard , whereas God knows it was the first house on the right ! ''

		And then he indulged in a fine burst of wrath against the inaccurate historian .

		He appears to have been almost as passionately alive as the famous actress for whom he conceived some of his greatest characters .

		• • • Types of pedantry that afford no little entertain - ment in the amusement or the amused exasperation that they excite have been created in considerable number by the great novelists and playwrights .

		Scott 's Antiquary and
Dominie Sampson	PERSON	, Shake - speare 's Holofernes and
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	's Mr.
Casau	PERSON	- bon , are a few of the pedants that live and long will live in our literature .

		Worthy to be ranked with these -- in fact , almost a twin brother to Mr.
Casaubon	PERSON	-- is Lucas
Malet	PERSON	's Dr.
Casteen	PERSON	, the exi - gent and patience-trying father of the heroine in '' A Counsel of Perfection . ''

		A recent reading of the book impresses one with the admirable skill displayed in the portrayal of this purblind , self-absorbed , and altogether unamiable scholar . ''

		Lucas
Malet	PERSON	, '' as perhaps not all readers may remember , is the pen - name of Mrs.
St. Leger Harrison	PERSON	, youngest daughter of Charles
Kingsley	PERSON	.

		In the Rev. Dr.
Casteen	PERSON	, learned author of `` The Heretical Defections from the
Early Church	ORGANIZATION	, '' the world of letters gained a fit companion to
Dorothea Brooke	PERSON	's mummified hus - band , the sour-visaged recluse whose interests were wholly centred in his projected but never completed '' Key to All Mythologies . ''

		Compare the unrespon - sive hardness of the two men .

		In the midst of a little discussion with
Dorothea	PERSON	in which Mr.
Casau	PERSON	- bon 's position threatened to become untenable , he broke off with the dry suggestion , '' We will , if you please , say no more on this subject ,
Dorothea	PERSON	.

		I have neither leisure nor energy for this kind of debate . ''

		No wonder the young wife exclaimed to herself in despair : '' What have I done -- what am I -- that he should treat me so ?

		He never knows what is in my mind -- he never cares .

		What is the use of anything I do ? ''

		Much in the same manner ,
Lydia Casteen	PERSON	finds herself continually misunder - stood and put in the wrong by her father despite all her uncomplaining devotion to him and his great book .

		Dr.
Casteen	PERSON	checks a debate with
Lydia	PERSON	in which he is not distinguishing himself for openness and liberality , by saying : `` I must entreat you to exercise a little more self-control ; pray spare me any more of these protests -- this emotion -- this instability of thought and intention .

		I am really unequal to further discussion .

		... It behooves me to husband carefully the remnants both of my mental and bodily strength . ''

		No wonder
Lydia	PERSON	's `` heart was sore for a little affection , her thoughts bitter , her sense of injury keen .

		Her father , as usual , had contrived to put her in the wrong . ''

		For concen - trated selfishness under a cloak of pedantic devotion to a magnum opus , these two desiccated embodi - ments of dead learning are a pair hard to equal .

		That the creator of Dr.
Casteen	PERSON	has studied appre - ciatively the valetudinarian Mr.
Casaubon	PERSON	is evident , but need not redound to her discredit .

		She is a writer of distinctly original quality .

		Dead authors who ought not to be buried in oblivion are repeatedly coming to the notice of the literary rambler .

		For example , there is
Mortimer Collins	PERSON	, author of '' Sweet Anne Page , '' a story of acknowledged charm , and of '' The Inn of Strange Meetings , '' a volume of clever verse ; and it was his daughter ,
Miss Mabel Collins	PERSON	-LRB- let it not be inferred that she too is dead -RRB- , who wrote the novel with the very taking title , `` The Prettiest Woman in
Warsaw	LOCATION	. ''

		A chance newspaper paragraph on the father gives a most prepossessing picture of the man , and makes one wish for a shelff ul of his books -LRB- if he wrote so many -RRB- and a week 's vacation in which to read them . ''

		His work , '' says one who knew him , '' reflected in a remarkable degree his wonderful personality .

		446 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Although it is over thirty years ago , I can still recall the magnificent frame and leonine head of
Mortimer Collins	PERSON	when , on one bright
summer	DATE	day , he sailed into the office of his publisher , Mr.
Henry S. King	PERSON	, on the historic spot from whence the CornhUl Magazine was first issued under
Thackeray	PERSON	's editor - ship , and I can again hear in fancy the sound of his deep , melodious voice , as I first heard it then ... He was every inch a man , a self-proclaimed artist and poet , and his books and his looks revealed another side of his character also ... The pleas - ure of dining at his table , garnished as it was with his own wonderful wit , was a never-to-be-forgotten experience .

		He was , as may be judged from the foregoing , the most unconventional of men in every respect ; but he was not , like many a poet and scholar , ` gey uncomfortable to live wi ' . '

		On the contrary , he made a poem out of life and fun out of everything .

		He was as big-hearted and boyish , genial , guileless and lovable as a great Newfound - land dog .

		The celebrated journalist ,
George Augustus Sala	PERSON	, characterized him as ' a ripe scholar and skilled mathematician , an antiquary , a botanist , a most melodious and facile versifier , a humourist and a wit . ' ''

		We are wont to complain of a dearth of great writers ; but , once having con - sented to seek enjoyment in authors not perched on the very apex of the pinnacle of greatness , how many of them there are with whom even a well-read person may find himself astonishingly unfamiliar .

		• • • The book-lover and the tbee-lovek may exist in one and the same person , and yet the book - loypr is , in a certain sense , and commonly without knowing it , a tree-destroyer , and so an enemy to trees .

		To provide wood-pulp for the paper that goes into the great bulk of our books and magazines and other periodicals and newspapers , there are annually denuded one thousand eight hundred and thirty square miles of woodland .

		-LRB- This interesting fact was brought to public notice at the recent investiga - tion of the so-called paper trust , when a representa - tive of newspaper interests argued convincingly for unprotected paper-manufacture . -RRB-

		How many square miles are left bare each year by the cutters of timber for building purposes , we can not say ; and how many are left in blackened ruin by forest fires , we shudder to imagine .

		But the buyer of books , or of printed matter in almost any form , is adding his infinitesimal fraction to the demand for more wood-pulp ; he is unconsciously calling to the woodman not to spare that tree ; and he is hastening , however innocently , the time when treeless , freshet-washed wastes , de - nuded of fertile soil and incapable of retaining the refreshing rains , shall give unpleasant premonition of the ultimate cessation of vital activity on this earth of ours .

		Not that this melancholy end is near enough to keep us awake nights , -- it may be millions or even billions of years in the future , for aught we know .

		But it is well for the reader to be reminded in due season that when this ruthless denudation of old mother earth shall have been accomplished , he , little though he may now be dreaming of any such thing , will have been & particeps criminis .

		• • • The tender grace of a day that is dead haunts the house in
Plymouth Grove	LOCATION	,
Manchester	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, where `` Cranford '' and ``
Mary Barton	PERSON	'' and the other delightful stories of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's were written , a house that for nearly half a century has remained a centre of social warmth , of refining influence , of a certain old-fashioned human charm and hospitality .

		The recent death , in that house , of Miss
Julia Gaskell	PERSON	, the youngest daughter of the novelist , and herself one of the best known person - ages in the social life and the philanthropic under - takings of
Manchester	LOCATION	, carries us back once more to that vanished Victorian age in whose prime her childhood was passed .

		She had , says one who knew her , the eager sympathy and communicative quick - ness that make good talk possible ; she was ardently interested in letters , painting , the theatre , and music , and her convictions and point of view were always unmistakable and characteristic .

		With an elder sister , also unmarried , she had continued to live in the house where her mother and her father , the Rev.
William Gaskell	PERSON	, of Cross-Street Chapel , had years before settled in what was then a rural suburb of the manufacturing city , but is now a crowded urban quarter in which almost the only breathing space is a recreation park recently pre - sented to the city by the Misses
Gaskell	PERSON	.

		Wealth and fashion have moved to the more attractive green spaces outside , but the
Gaskell	PERSON	house remains a now somewhat melancholy reminder of the good old days .

		Yet a little while , and it too will have vanished .

		... Recognition by one 's fellow-craftsmen is always a sweet reward for toil .

		A curious instance of such recognition on the part of a noted playwright recently deceased may be worth relating , or recall - ing , at this time .

		In that unusually interesting and perhaps too little known life of
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	which his sister-in-law .

		Miss
Harriett Jay	PERSON	, wrote immediately after his untimely death , occurs the following pleasant incident in connection with
Buchanan	PERSON	's dramatization of the Cupid and Psyche legend . ''

		The Bride of Love '' was the name he gave to his poetical and imaginative rendering of the ancient myth . ''

		There is no modern instance , I think , '' writes
Miss Jay	PERSON	, '' of a poetical play atti-act - ing audiences on its own merits apart from the arts of the showman and the tricks of the scene-painter .

		This experiment cost him some thousands of pounds , nor was he much consoled , I fancy , by the almost daily receipt of letters from unknown admirers con - gratulating him on the work .

		One of these letters was so remarkable in the tone of its compliments as to be almost unique .

		The writer said that he had
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 447 long ceased to find in the theatre the enjoyment and the interest of his early years ; the glamour had all passed away , as he thought , forever ; but in witnessing the ' Bride of Love , ' he said , all the charm and all the glamour had returned , and he felt again the delight and enthusiasm of his boyhood .

		The signature to this letter was that of the distin - guished American dramatist ,
Bronson Howard	PERSON	. ''

		• • •
The Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's
Miltoniana	LOCATION	, rich in number and variety , were temporarily aug - mented to form an exhibition in memory of the great poet 's birth three hundred years ago .

		On the ninth of this month -LRB-
Milton	LOCATION	's birthday -RRB- there was opened to the public such a display of Milton books and manuscripts and portraits as had never before been gathered together in this country .

		To the treasures of this sort already owned by the library , valuable additions were made in loans from Mrs.
J. Mont	PERSON	- gomery
Sears	ORGANIZATION	's collection and from the large stock of literary rarities accumulated in
London	LOCATION	by that genius of the book-trade , Mr.
Bernard Quaritch	PERSON	.

		Perhaps the most interesting item in the exhibition was an autograph loaned by him in the form of an old parchment , about two feet long by eighteen inches wide , dated
1623	DATE	and bearing the boy
Milton	PERSON	's sig - nature at the bottom .

		It was a post-nuptial settle - ment between the poet 's sister Anne and
Edward Phillips	PERSON	.

		Milton 's extant signatures are so rare as to give great value to this document .

		In connection with all this tercentenary celebration the natural query arises , Will it prompt one person out of half a million to open his '' Paradise Lost '' and read it through from cover to cover , or even one book of it ?

		Somehow the poem does not irresistibly appeal to twentieth-century cravings .

		One would like to know what is the present demand for it at public libraries and book-shops .

		, , A TRANSLATOR OF UNEXAMPLED POPULARITY has been taken from us , to the grief of thousands of readers -- especially young readers -- by the recent death of Mrs.
A. L. Wister	PERSON	at the home of her brother , Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, in
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia .

		To find another American writer who has made for herself such a place in girls ' affections , one would have to go back to
Louisa Alcott	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	's books , translations though they were , seemed to breathe her own personality ; they all had her charac - teristics .

		To be translated by Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	must have been felt , by the German story-tellers whom she thus distinguished , to be a high honor .

		There was a sin - gular prophecy in the dedication to her last published work , '' The
Lonely House	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Adolph Streckfuss	PERSON	.

		She wrote : '' I take pleasure in inscribing this translation -- the last I shall ever complete -- to the children and grandchildren of those who so kindly welcomed the first , published a lifetime ago . ''

		By generations of children yet to come her versions of wholesome and homely German romances are likely to be read with all the delight that hailed their first appearance .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE '' DISSIDENCE OF DISSENT '' AMONG ESPERANTISTS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The letter of a correspondent in your last issue , advocating '' Ido '' in place of the universal language Esperanto , has caused some amusement among
Esper	PERSON	- antist circles in the
East	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
McPike	PERSON	is neither con - vincing nor consistent . ''

		Simplified Esperanto '' -LRB- called '' Ido '' -RRB- is no more practical than simplified English , and the ultimate result of the two will be the same .

		It is not generally known that the author of '' Ido '' is
M. de Beaufront	PERSON	, and that what seems to be his chief reason for publishing this rival to the language which he formerly endorsed is his dissatisfaction with the subordinate position that up to this time he has been content to take .

		Even the title of his language is an Esperanto word , meaning a descendant !

		This defection has caused some indignation among Esperantists , who have been working for twenty-two years , spreading the language all over the world and meeting with remarkable success ; and all who have used it -- such men as Count Tolstoy , Sir
WiUiam Ramsay	PERSON	, Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	, and Mr.
George Harvey	PERSON	, president of the national Esperanto association -- unite in declar - ing it entirely satisfactory for representing every shade of meaning of which the human speech is capable .

		If the new generation , they protest , is to be informed that changes are proposed in this perfectly practical language by a band of childish malcontents , the people will naturally hesitate before taking up the study , not only of Esperanto but of any universal tongue whatever , arguing that if '' reforms '' are once started -LRB- where they are unnecessary -RRB- there would be little use in giving time to acquiring a language the fundamentals of which are likely never to remain constant .

		The author of '' Ido '' is nothing less than a plagiarfst , for it is evident that he has appropriated nearly all the advantages of Esperanto and has added to them ideas of his own which improve Esperanto little .

		These ideas , if published broadcast with the mantle of a former authority on and adherent of the tongue which he now seeks to supersede , may work havoc with the cause of any universal tongue .

		But Esperantists , knowing the history of '' Ido '' and its inventor , do not apprehend any serious rivalry .

Atjthokized Life of Whisti.ek	ORGANIZATION	.

		*
Whistler	LOCATION	's selection of Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	as his biographers was an exceptionally happy one .

		Whatever may be thought of their esti - mate of him as '' the greatest artist of his time '' and one of the commanding figures in the art of all time , there can be no question that Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	, upon whom the literary workmanship of `` The Life of James
McNeill	PERSON
Whistler	LOCATION	'' devolved , has written a most enchanting book .

		This much must be admitted even by the Philistines who neither know nor care anything about art .

		The charm with which the relation has been invested is indeed compelling .

		The abundant material , brought forth by painstaking effort , has been arranged with consummate skill .

		Much was learned from the lips of the master himself .

		This has been supplemented by the recollections of his friends and of many people who in one way or another had been brought into close contact with him .

		The book is a conscientious endeavor to put before the reader
Whistler	LOCATION	as he really was -- as he appeared to those privi - leged to know him intimately .

		So to tell the tale that his unique personality would appear in its proper light , that his idiosyncrasies would not obscure the vision of the inner man and rob the portrait of verisimilitude , was not an easy task .

		Its successful accomplishment is largely due to the straightforward simplicity and directness of the narration .

		The numerous anecdotes with which the pages are enlivened are so introduced that each one contributes some - thing to our understanding of the man .

		No attempt has been made to gloze over his faults .

		Frankly set forth , they are left to make what im - pression they may ; and if they seem not greatly in evidence , it is because such things are , after all , always relative , and in
Whistler	LOCATION	's case they were far outweighed by his finer qualities .

		The world is dominated by conventional ideas from the bondage of which few have the pre - science or the courage to break away .

		To strive long and suffer much in the effort to im - press new truths upon the inert mass of their unthinking fellows has been the usual experi - ence of the bearers of important messages that did not square with prevailing notions .

		It was
Whistler	LOCATION	's lot to be the bearer of a message for which the world is not yet ready -- ♦ The

		an intellectual concept easier of apprehension than comprehension by the mass of mankind , and likely therefore to be fought over by oppos - ing factions for many generations to come .

		The concept is not a new one , nor was
Whistler	LOCATION	its first prophet .

		It is merely that subject as such and art as such are separate , although not sep - arable , things ; that the appeal of art is solely to the aesthetic sense , and that , as a necessary corollary , the artist has no mission except to create beauty .

		This concept
Whistler	LOCATION	presented in concrete form .

		His pictures were its visual exponents .

		He called them '' arrangements '' in certain colors , and the conventional world about him knew not what to think of them or of him .

		His own words in this connection are pertinent : '' I know that many good people think my nomen - clature funny and myself ' eccentric ' Yes , ' eccen - tric ' is the adjective they find for me .

		The vast majority of English folk can not and will not consider a picture as a picture , apart from any story which it may be supposed to tell .

		... As music is the poetry of sound , so is painting the poetry of sight , and the subject-matter has nothing to do with harmony of sound or of colour . ''

		Readers of the book will enjoy another famous utterance , too long to be quoted here , wherein , in terms of witty and withering sarcasm .

		Whistler paid his compliments to '' the British subject . ''

		The critics and the people were alike bewildered .

		`` He had , '' says Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	, '' robbed them of their only pleasure in art . ''

		Accordingly they scoffed at what they could not understand .

		They laughed at the paintings , and they laughed at the painter , refusing to take seriously on.e of the most serious of men .

		As unfolded in the pages of this delectable biography , the story of the long years of patient effort before recognition came is an impressive human document .

		With delicate tact and sym - pathy Mrs. PenneU depicts the life-struggle of the great man , high-strung , abnormally sensitive , hurt to the quick by lack of appreciation and persistent misunderstanding , yet in the face of ridicule , open antagonism , and even personal affront , holding tenaciously to his artistic creed , and waiting until past middle-age for the meed of praise he had earned early in his career .

		Whistler 's militant spirit did not permit him to take the buffeting meekly .

		Nature had endowed him with exuberant vitality , extra - ordinary social talent and personal magnetism , and wit of the most brilliant and pungent quality .

		These were alike his saving graces , the defiant masque behind which he hid his real self from a cruel and unfeeling world , and also , it can scarcely be doubted , contributory causes that did

		THE DIAL 449 much to defer merited honors .

		For the pleasure of impaling real or fancied enemies upon the shafts he forged for their undoing , he paid a heavy price .

		If he wished to be taken seriously he shoidd not have made the world laugh .

		Yet we could ill spare even one of these witticisms -- so nicely calculated , exquisitely polished , irre - sistibly amusing , and withal so deadly .

		One might almost fancy the victims expiring in hys - terics between their laughter and their tears .

		His quick resentment was , alas , often aroused by affronts that were not intended as such , and it was incomprehensible to the offenders whose feelings would not have been hurt had the rela - tive positions been reversed .

		The misunder - standing was sometimes mutual .

		In being mis - understood he took whimsical and contemptuous delight , born of conscious superiority to a public incapable of perceiving truth which to him was self-evident .

		What he could not forgive was pretense to knowledge of art .

		That irritated and provoked him ; it was a crime against art , and he felt impelled to take up cudgels in her defense .

		There were other sides to
Whistler	LOCATION	's character , as Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	shows .

		Not less salient traits were unfailing kindness and tender affection for his friends , of whom he had many throughout the entire course of his life .

		Despite the insist - ent egoism that made him always a law unto himself , few men have ever inspired more ardent friendship .

		The veneration in which he is held by his biographers is indeed almost overpowering , and might raise doubts as to the veracity of the portrait were not adoring witnesses so many .

		Those who knew him well are all alike worship - pers at the shrine ; and it is impossible that their love could have been undeserved .

		Even his ser - vants , Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	tells us , were always devoted to him , and endured without complaint the incon - veniences caused by his unconventional ways and habitual unpimctuality .

		In a very special sense .

		Whistler 's art was his life .

		It was `` the begiiming and end of his every thought and ambition . ''

		To separate
Whistler	LOCATION	the man from
Whistler	LOCATION	the artist woidd be impossible .

		Quite properly , there - fore , this biography is full of details about his methods of working , his paintings and drawings , his etchings and lithographs , when they were executed and where they were exhibited .

		The transcendent quality of his etchings was admitted from the very first ; but , although his greatness as an artist has long been conceded , there is stiU rather halting recognition of the artistic worth of his paintings .

		Yet , to those who have passed beyond the childhood stage of art-appreciation , they make no uncertain appeal , and the best of them belong in the category of the world 's masterpieces .

		As a colorist he has had few superiors .

		Upon color and composition he lavished all his knowledge and skill .

		To make the color '' grow out of the gray '' of the back - gi'ound , as he expressed it , was his constant effort .

		This could be accomplished to his satis - faction only by painting his pictures at a single sitting .

		Rather than retouch them he preferred to scrape out what had been done and begin over again .

		In this way countless sittings were required for his portraits .

		The method involved sacrifices , -- among them , minute accuracy of draughtsmanship .

		Out of this grew the charge that he could not draw .

		Hands and feet in particular gave him difficulty , as to delineate them with precision would have taken more time than was available .

		He could of course draw , and draw divinely ; but the truth is that drawing was not his strongest point , and that rhythm of line sometimes gave him infinite trouble , as he admitted to his friend
Fantin	PERSON	- Latour in a letter in which he '' deplored the mistakes of his early training . ''

		All human accomplishment is circumscribed by the limitation that attainment in any direc - tion is at the expense of shortcoming in some other .

		No criticism is fair that does not take this into consideration .

		Whistler 's art shoidd be judged in the light of what he aimed to do .

		It was not the only thing worth doing , though to him it may have seemed to be ; but the lesson he taught was one of great importance , and in teaching it he produced many works of power and beauty for which the world has reason to be profoundly grateful .

		No artist ever strove more earnestly to realize his ideal .

		From the Jap - anese he had learned that in the finest compo - sitions there can be nothing superfluous , and that every shape , every line , every hue and tone must be right in relation to every other and to the combined effect of all .

		Therefore , whatever entered into his pictures was subjected to the fire of the most critical taste .

		He was '' always striving for the little more that meant perfec - tion , '' nor , within the limits he set for himself , did he fail to achieve it .

		Where art was concerned .

		Whistler could endure no trifling .

		Like all men of genius , he had infinite capacity for taking pains .

		His letters were as carefully constructed as his pictures , and it is impossible not to regret that his biographers were restrained from printing any of them .

		We could , however , better afford 460 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The outward appearance of Mr. and Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's fine volumes is in keeping with their con - tents .

		The form is that of the large-paper copies of '' The Gentle Art of Making Enemies , '' which
Whistler	LOCATION	himself designed ; and the typography is in accord with the most exacting taste .

		A few inaccuracies have crept in , some of them plainly attributable to the haste with which the proof-reading had to be done to get the book out before the holidays .

		Whistler 's funeral was not on
July 23	DATE	, as stated , but on
Wednesday , July 22	DATE	.

		By a slip of the pen , the date of his father 's death , which occurred on
April 7 , 1849	DATE	, is given as
August 9 , 1849	DATE	, although upon the next page that is named as the date when the widow and her two sons landed in

Howard Mansfield	PERSON	's catalogue of
Whistler	LOCATION	's etchings and dry-points , shortly to be issued by the

Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	catalogue . ''

		The numerous illustrations constitute a fea - ture of great interest .

		Many of them are in photogravure , and as reproductions they give all that could be asked for save color .

		Few lovers of the poem doubt its genuine elegiac character .

		The father 's sorrow is too sore for allegory . ''

		I mourned my pearl , dear beyond cost , And strange fears with my fancy fought ; My will in wretchedness was lost .

		There falls upon the mourner , praying at the flower-grown grave , a sleep in which he beholds , beyond a sundering river , a maiden '' glimmer - ing white '' in fair linen bordered with pearls , the Bride of the Lamb , his little daughter already a queen in heaven .

		She teaches him the mysteries of faith , and guides him to a hill - top whence he catches glimpses of the
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	.

		The essential content of the thren - ody -- its anguish of loss , its wistful look into Paradise -- is of universal appeal ; and we may well be grateful to any and all translators who re-phrase the mediaeval into modern without sacrifice of the original pathos and beauty . ''

		The Pearl '' but barely escaped oblivion , surviving the centuries in a single manuscript .

		Bound up with three other Middle English poems , '' Purity , '' '' Patience , '' '' Sir
Gawain	PERSON	and the Green Knight , '' it long lay unregarded among the riches of the British Museum .

		The
Early English Text Society	ORGANIZATION	gave it to scholars in
1864	DATE	; and Mr.
Israel Gollancz	PERSON	in
1891	DATE	ex - tended the gift to us all , printing the text on the left-hand pages , with a line for line and stanza for stanza rendering on the right .

		This translation , though making no attempt at rhyme , has the look of stanzas and a certain rhythmic movement , together with a force and fineness of phrasing that contribute to a general poetic effect .

		The sixth stanza , for instance , is thus rendered : '' My spirit thence sped forth into space , my body lay there entranced on that mound , my soul , by grace of God , had fared in quest of adventure , where marvels be .

		I knew not where that region was ; I was borne , iwis , where the cliffs rose sheer ; toward a forest I set my face , where rocks so radiant were to see , that none can trow how rich was the light the gleaming glory that glinted therefrom , for never a web by mortal spun was half so wondrous fair . ''

		Some readers may prefer to this the literal prose translation -LRB- privately printed at Prince - ton in
1907	DATE	-RRB- of Dr.
Charles G. Osgood	PERSON	, who in the year preceding had brought out in the I `` Belles-Letters Series '' a new edition of the text .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 461 The corresponding passage in Dr.
Osgood	PERSON	's ver - sion reads more simply . ''

		Thence sprang my soul aloft while my body lay at the grave-momid in dreams .

		For in God 's grace my soul set forth on a strange journey to behold marvels .

		I knew not where in the world it was ; I only saw that I was brought into a place where great cliffs stood cleaving together .

		Toward a forest I took my way , where were seen rocks of richest hue .

		The light -- the gleaming glory that flashed from them might no man beUeve ; no fabric woven by men was ever half so bright and rare . ''

		More readers , perhaps , would respond to Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's version -LRB- Century Company ,
1906	DATE	; reprinted in
Mosher	PERSON	's `` Bibelot ' series ,
July , 1908	DATE	-RRB- , which renders a poem by a poem , though in different stanzaic form . ''

		Thence sped my spirit far through space , My body tranced upon the groimd .

		My soul 's quick ghost by God 's sure grace Adventuring where be marvels found .

		I wist not where on earth that place With cloven cliffs , so high and sheer .

		But toward a wood I set my face .

		Borne whither radiant rocks appear .

		Their light more golden than the sun , A gleaming glory glinted thence : Was never web of mortals spun So wondrous fair to mortal sense . ''

		Yet Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's rendering , altogether sympa - thetic and poetic , falls in two points short of the ideal translation .

		It does not reproduce the complicated but most effective metrical scheme of the original , and it gives less than half of the elegy , -- forty-six stanzas out of the one hundred and one .

		The technical structure of '' The Pearl '' might well be the despair of translators , com - bining as it does the old alliteration with an elaborate system of rhyme .

		Each stanza con - sists of twelve verses , carried on three rhymes , one occuring six times , one four and one two .

		The closing verse of each stanza constitutes a refrain repeated , with slight variations , for a group of five stanzas that are further linked together by echoing in the first line of each new stanza the chief word in the last line of its predecessor .

		By way of illustration , here are stanzas 82 and 83 in the rendering of Miss
Marian Mead	PERSON	-LRB-
Mosher	PERSON	's '' Old World Series ''
1908	DATE	-RRB- .

		To the father , longing for a sight of the City of God , the daughter gives direction . '' '

		Wilt thou see the spot where it doth hide , Bend thy steps up toward the river 's head .

		And across from thee upon this side , I will follow , till thou to a hill hast led . '

		Then there woidd I no longer bide ; By fair-leav 'd boughs I softly fled , Till a hill before me I espied .

		And beheld the city , as up 1 sped .

		Beyond the stream , far from me , that stead , That brighter than sun , with clear beams shone ; In Apocalypse its fashion is read , As describeth it the Apostle John . ''

		As John the apostle saw the sight .

		Saw I that city high renown 'd ,
Jerusalem	LOCATION	the New , full royally dight , As it new alighted from heaven was found .

		Of pure gold all that burgh was built , Burnish 'd , it gleam 'd like glass around , With precious gems beneath it pightj The base with courses twelve was crown 'd , Foundations twelve , full richly bound .

		And a special stone each tier thereon ; As well that city 's praise doth soimd .

		In Apocalypse , the Apostle John . ''

		The above passage is fairly representative of
Miss Mead	ORGANIZATION	's version throughout , exemplifying its general accuracy and literary skill and also its occasional lapses in rhyme -LRB- sight , dight , built , pight -RRB- and more frequent roughening of the music , with a lack of ease , here and there , in phrase and sentence-turn .

		Yet as a whole Miss
Mead	PERSON	's version is a marked advance upon Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	's -LRB-
Nutt	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
1907	DATE	-RRB- , the first to attempt the difficult metrical scheme .

		Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	's rendering of these same stanzas is as follows : '' ' If I that spot shall now un-hide .

		Bend upward to this streamlet 's head .

		And I against thee on this side .

		Until thou see a broad hill spread . '

		Then would I no longer bide .

		But stole through many a flowery mead ; Till , from a hill that 1 espied , I saw its dazzling radiance shed .

		Beyond the swirling river-bed It shone more radiant than the sim : In Apocalypse is its fashion said As deviseth it the Apostle John . ''

		Even as it met the Apostle 's sight , Saw I that city of great renown , The
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	, royally dight As it was let from heaven adown .

		Its bulwarks burned with gold so bright , As burnished glass that gleams around .

		With noble gems all underpight .

		And pillars twelve on their bases bound : On twelve gi-eat slabs the Lord did fomid Those walls , and each a precious stone ; As standeth written of this fair town In Apocalypse of the Apostle John . ''

		It will be seen that under the stress of his exacting task Mr.
Coulton	PERSON	has had resort not only to grossly defective rhymes -LRB- mead , shed ; renown , adown , around , bound , found , town -RRB- , but to words -LRB- as `` un-hide '' -RRB- that can hardly pass muster under his term '' archaic . ''

		If we must offer a glaring example of his eccentricities in diction , his forty-sixth stanza stands ready .

		In turning to Professor
Jewett	PERSON	's recent version -LRB- issued in holiday form and also in plain binding for class-room use -RRB- we soon realize , as with Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's , that we are reading a poem trans - lated by a poet .

		To illustrate the fvdl group of five stanzas , and to make , at least in part , com - parison with these two other renderings in the original metre , we cite the
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	sec - tion , one of the most difficult in the whole elegy . '' '

		This flawless sight I will not hide ; Up toward the brook 's head thou must go , While I will follow on this side .

		Till yonder hill the city show . '

		And then I would no longer bide , But stole through branches , bending low .

		Till from the summit I espied .

		Through green boughs swaying to and fro ,
Afar	LOCATION	, the city , all aglow .

		That brighter than bright sunbeams shone .

		In writing it is pictured so .

		In the
Revelation of St. John	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		As John the Apostle saw the sight , I saw that city , standing near
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, so royal dight .

		As if from
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	alighted here .

		The city all of gold burned bright .

		Like gleaming glass that glistens clear .

		With precious stones beneath set right : Foundations twelve of gems most dear .

		Wrought wondrous richly , tier on tier .

		Each base was of a separate stone As , perfectly , it doth appear In the Revelation of St. John . ''

		John named the stones that he had seen , I knew the order that he made ; The first a jasper must have been .

		That on the lowest base was laid .

		Beneath the rest it glinted green ; A sapphire in the second grade ; Chalcedony , from blemish clean , In the third course was fair arrayed ; Fourth , emerald , of greenest shade .

		Fifth , sardonyx , was raised thereon ; The sixth a ruby , as is said In the Revelation of St. John . ''

		John joined to these the chrysolite , The seventh gem in that basement ; The eighth , a beryl , clear and white ; The topaz , ninth , its luster lent ; Tenth , chrysoprase , both soft and bright ;
Eleventh	LOCATION	, the jacinth , translucent ; And twelfth , and noblest to recite .

		Amethyst , blue with purple blent .

		The wall above those basements went Jasper , like glass that glistening shone ; I saw , as the story doth present , -- The Revelation of St. John . ''

		I saw , as
John	PERSON	doth clear devise : The great stones rose like a broad stair ; Above , the city , to my eyes .

		In height , length , breadth appeared four-square ; The jasper wall shone amber-wise .

		The golden streets as glass gleamed fair ; The dwellings glowed in glorious guise With every stone most rich and rare .

		Each length of bright wall bailded there For full twelve furlongs ' space stretched on , And height , length , breadth all equal were : ♦ I saw one mete it , ' writeth John . ''

		Here we have verse moving as simply and with as little apparent self-consciousness as prose -- translation whose fidelity is instinctive , grace answering to grace .

		It is not too much to say that
Miss Jewett	PERSON	's translation crowns the series .

		The original stanza is kept through the whole poem , without a single concession to imperfect rhyme .

		Monotony is avoided by special skiU in the placing of the csesura and the sentence-stops , giving an effect of variety and ease .

		The movement is completely musi - cal , though occasionally asking of the reader , as above in '' basement '' and '' translucent , '' the stressing of a normally unaccented syllable .

		The wording , at once simple and poetic , has distinc - tion .

		Imagination and feeling are in full play , the translator seeing what the mediaeval dreamer saw , and , with him , wondering and rejoicing at the vision .

		This unknown author of '' The Pearl '' is thus apostrophized by
Miss Jewett	PERSON	in a prefatory stanza : '' Poet of beauty , pardon me If touch of mine have tarnishfed
Thy Pearl	ORGANIZATION	's pure luster , loved by thee ; Or dimmed thy vision of the dead Alive in light and gaiety .

		Thy life is like a shadow fled ; Thy place we know not nor degree , The stock that b `` -RRB- re thee , school that bred ; Yet shall thy fame be sung and said .

		THE DIAL 458
Henley 's liiTERARY Monument	ORGANIZATION	.

		* No writer could ask of the piety of his sur - vivors a more substantial memorial than has been reared to
Henley	ORGANIZATION	in the new edition of his works .

		But the cere jmrennius nobody can build out of a mere fulness of fair , clear pages : an artist has to rear his own monument .

		Mean - while , it is pleasant that so rich a token should be laid like a wreath upon the memory of a strong man in his and our day .

		Henley 's career did not go altogether as he had planned it .

		Years ago he wrote of himself -LRB- in a preface not included in this edition -RRB- : '' After spending the better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry , I found myself -LSB- about 1877 -RSB- so utterly un - marketable that I had to confess myself beaten in art , and to addict myself to journalism for the next ten years . ''

		The implication is that he recognized prose art to be not within his prov - ince .

		And indeed it was not .

		He produced no prose comparable with his verse , though all of it was useful and much of it brilliant .

		How - ever , his journalism was of the type which has produced and maintained the great English reviews .

		One of his most remarkable attributes was his extraordinary faculty of discovering and bringing out young or unrecognized talents .

		He was a great editor .

		But as we are now for the first time in possession of everything of his which is likely to be reprinted , as we see it all together and get its effect as a whole , the question we naturally ask ourselves is what he amounted to , not as a man but as a writer .

		His prose occupies in this edition five of the seven volumes .

		The two volumes of '' Views and Reviews '' suggest , he says , `` less a book than a mosaic of scraps and shreds recovered from the shot rubbish of some fourteen years of journalism . ''

		But it is a patchwork of exceedingly rich materials .

		These brief and flashing notes upon great writers and painters express a criticism personal and impressionistic , but full of life .

		Here , indeed , rather than in the two volumes of essays , we find the prose
Henley	PERSON	whom we like to remember .

		For leisure seems to have had a queer effect of developing in him a tendency to truculence , above all a tendency to dwell with a sort of defiant gusto upon those aspects of greatness which the world as a whole is anxious to ignore .

		Henley has been called a Pagan , perhaps believed himself to be one ; but there is no such person in the modern world -- or at least no • The Works op
W. E. Henley	PERSON	.

		In seven volumes .


London	LOCATION	:
David Nutt	PERSON	.

		such person is now articulate .

		We protest too much , and in the end prove ourselves to be mere inverted Puritans .

		Henley 's hatred of cant and sentimentalism led him to extremes of utterance .

		His Introduction to the Centenary edition of Burns had not the obituary ring and lacked the dispassionateness fairly to be demanded under the conditions .

		That was not the place for a protest or a manifesto .

		The substance of his contention as to
Burns	PERSON	's character is hardly to be seriously disputed ; we have the poet 's own frank evidence to go by .

		Nor do we suppose that
Henley	PERSON	was unjust to the memory of
Stevenson	PERSON	in the substance of his unguarded and greatly resented protest against
Balfour	PERSON	's fancy picture .

		To cover his friend 's memory with silver-gilt really seemed to him an act of treach - ery .

		But in his hasty attempt to set that friend before the world as a man human in his faults as well as in his virtues , he allowed himself to be offensive .

		He could not be calmly judicious , and often appeared cynical , because he could not bear the thought of appearing sentimental .

		But this is not all .

		As you read over these two volumes of carefully considered essays , you are aware of a tendency to dwell upon sexual frailty which represents not merely a revulsion against prudery .

		He is not prurient , but he has that dangerous pride in his faculty of call - ing a spade a spade which ends in keeping one unnecessarily on the lookout for that useful but not ornamental object .

		He is very severe with
Burns	PERSON	for his lewdness , but -LRB- although he resents
Taine	PERSON	's label of Fielding as the '' Good Buffalo '' and pronounces him one of the best of men -RRB- declares that he has no doubt there was a Lady BeUaston in Fielding 's own experience , and that '' The Matthews and BeUaston episodes were profitable to Fielding : profitable and deemed in no sort reprehensible . ''

		It is hard enough to stomach the Lady BeUaston relation in connec - with
Tom Jones	PERSON	: are we to be required to ac - cept it of Fielding with this bland complacency , while in the same breath we call him , with
Henley	PERSON	, '' ■ a humane , stately , and honourable gentleman '' ?

		Even so he dwells upon the fleshly failings of
Smollett	PERSON	and of
Hazlitt	PERSON	, -- above all , of
Balzac	LOCATION	; so that in the end one wearies at the insistence with which this oije harsh string is sounded .

		Henley 's criticism has notes far sweeter and sounder , though it is his nature and intent to be robustious rather than agreeable .

		Get him away from his hobbies , absorb him in his theme and not in his effect , and you find yourseK in the presence of a crit - icism sound as well as independent .

		454 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, The volume of plays , joint work of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	and
Stevenson	PERSON	, is disappointing to read , if one takes it up with the expectation of finding therein anything of real dramatic importance . ''

		Beau Austin '' is a finished comedy of eight - eenth century manners .

		We can easily under - stand why it should have '' acted well , '' but it is , after all , no more than a bit of pleasant arti - fice .

		The three other plays are meritorious studies in melodrama . ''

		Deacon Brodie '' is a sort of Dr.
Jekyl	PERSON	reduced to the
Adelphi	LOCATION	con - vention ; it would have a real and lively interest for the gallery . ''

		Admiral Guinea '' is less conventional , and therefore less acceptable as melodrama .

		`` Macaire '' the authors call a '' melodramatic farce '' ; but it seems to be rather a piece of very light romantic comedy suddenly cut short by a shocking catastrophe .

		The sketch was successfully produced , but it is hard to see how any gallery can have put up with it .

		In the end , our judgment of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's achieve - ment rests upon his two volumes of poetry .

		For here is a true and fresh lyric note .

		He was one of the few veritable singers of his day , whether the burden of his song might be war , or love , or work , or the life of the street .

		His poems of the
London	LOCATION	hospital and the
London	LOCATION	highway have naturally been more highly praised for their originality , their modernity , -- in short , their timely or journalistic quality .

		They are excellent poems in their class ; but the poet 's reputation will linger rather in the perfect lyrics of ''
Hawthorne	PERSON	and Lavender '' or in the stout war-songs of '' For
England	LOCATION	's Sake . ''

		trial in renewed strength and purity .

		Grown to womanhood in
Italy	LOCATION	, in the companionship of her father , a scholarly recluse , she comes back to her own English land after his death , and takes a country house .

		She has become fitted into her new sphere of life , and has given her heart to a rising young statesman , when the blow falls , and she learns the secret of her father 's secluded existence , and of the tragedy that had darkened his life at the time of her early childhood .

		For it seems that her mother had been drawn into a network of wickedness , had killed a man in a moment of passion , and had been the central figure in a murder trial that had been the sensation of its day .

		Diana 's new friends know of this tragic prelude to her life , but can not bring themselves to break the truth to her , and she learns it just as she has become betrothed .

		She imparts the revelation to her lover , who is not strong enough to accept the situation thus changed ; he thinks too much of his career and too little of his love , and weakly lets her go .

		The scene of the story then changes from
England	LOCATION	to
Italy	LOCATION	, whither
Diana	PERSON	flees with her wounded heart .

		Presently her former lover discovers that his weakness in the critical hour of their relationship has reacted upon his politi - cal career , that his power is broken , and he is on the point of physical collapse .

Diana	LOCATION	to return to him .

		This is the bare outline of the story which Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has told us with all the technical mastery we have learned to expect from her .

		The merit of the work rests almost wholly upon its technical virtue , and upon the author 's intimate and accurate knowledge of the social and political circles in which her charac - ters have their being .

		It is all so extremely well informed , and so thoroughly well done , that it is difficult to understand why we should not be more deeply moved by it and why it should not make a more lasting impression .

		For the story , even in its climactic scenes , leaves us comparatively cold , and seems to illustrate anew the fact that the ultimate aim of creative art may be defeated by an excess of calculation and a too obvious reliance upon literary artifice .

1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 455 Unless Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	can escape from the well - defined pattern which her latest novels have assumed , the continuance of her vogue will be a matter of mere momentum , and not the sign of a vitalizing influence .

		Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	has given us a surpris - ingly good novel in his '' Sir
Richard Escombe	PERSON	, '' a tale of
England	LOCATION	in the
middle years of the eighteenth century	DATE	.

		It has for its central feature the notorious doings of the dissolute roisterers who made
Medmenham Abbey	ORGANIZATION	a name of evil import , and it relates the manner in which the disreputable Society of St.
Francis	PERSON	was brought to an end .

		It is , of course , Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	's titular hero who is the appointed means of so praiseworthy an achievement ; and we follow his career with deep interest , although his type -- that of the daredevil Irish soldier -- has been worked pretty hard by earlier novelists .

		The heroine also , appropriately named
Kitty	PERSON	, is of the sort that always goes with this particular kind of hero , being by turns witty , pert , wilful , and unreasonable , yet ail the time sound at heart , and the pattern of constancy .

		Mr.
Pemberton	PERSON	has worked up his '' manners and customs '' in a way that we find rather surprising , when we recall the extent to which he has hitherto relied upon sheer invention for his effects .

		He may have done this by a diligent reading of other novelists , from
Thackeray	PERSON	down , but he cer - tainly has achieved an easy familiarity with the dialect and the fashion of the period .

		His tale is thus given an unexpected richness of texture , and this , in addition to a fairly creditable plot , makes it a highly readable piece of work .

		Curiously enough , there is an echo of the revels at
Medmenham Abbey	ORGANIZATION	in `` Wroth , '' the latest romantic invention of Mr. and Mrs.
Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lord
Wroth	PERSON	, known as '' Mad
Wroth	PERSON	, '' comes into possession of his ancestral estate .

		Hurley Priory , just before the time of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, and , with the aid of certain choice and reckless spirits of his acquaintance , renews the sort of sacrilegious revelry that had made the Society of
St. Francis	ORGANIZATION	notorious some two generations earlier .

		One wild
autumn	DATE	night , when the revels are in full swing , the
Lady Juliana	LOCATION	,
Contessa di Belgiojoso dei Vespi	ORGANIZATION	, travelling by post in that neighborhood , is captured and brought into the
Priory	LOCATION	, being mistaken for a lady of light virtue whose arrival has been expected .

		The effect upon
Wroth	PERSON	is magical , for he becomes her champion , expels the rout of his followers , and sends his guest upon her way with due honors .

		This constitutes the prologue to a romance of tense emotionalism and happy outcome .

		Wroth develops into a truly Byronic hero , pursues his lady all over
Europe	LOCATION	-LRB- after the death of her aged and wicked spouse -RRB- , defends her against all comers , and eventually wins her .

		The tale is prolonged by a curious invention .

		The hero is on the verge of bank - ruptcy , and a marriage is the only condition upon which he may preserve his fortune .

		With characteristic recklessness he offers himself in the open market , and weds , as he supposes , the brazen creature for whom Lady
Juliana	PERSON	had been mistaken in the prologue .

		But his bride is veiled , and is no other than the heroine her - self , who has effected an ingenious substitution at the critical moment .

		Consequently , the sub - sequent long pursuit is really the pursuit of his lawful wife -- the fact known to her , but un - dreamed of by him .

		This raises a pretty moral issue , for the love which he offers her is an unlawful one , as far as his own knowledge goes , and she would feel degraded by its acceptance .

		It is only in the act of desperate renunciation that he learns the truth , thus redeeming himself in the sight of his lady , and winning her by his very willingness to make the sacrifice .

		The interest of the situation becomes fairly breath - less as we near the close , and it is with a sigh of relief that we witness the untangling of the coil .

		A stirring and hearty tale , written in boyish humor , about a hero who remains a boy in spirit all the way through , is given us in '' The Big Fellow , '' by Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	.

		Even at college ,
James Harden	PERSON	towered over his fellow - students , and his thews won for him athletic distinction .

		Fortunately , his moral plan was upon the same large lines , and his personality was magnetic as well as imposing .

		We first meet him as he is about to leave college , and go home to his native town in the
Middle West	LOCATION	, where he is eagerly awaited by a household consisting of mother , an aunt , and an adopted daughter .

		He finds their affairs at a crisis , and learns at how great a cost of privation his education has been secured .

		It will be a task to set the family upon its feet , but he feels equal to it , and goes to work with health , strength , and temperamental optimism for his sole assets .

		Going to the city , he takes the first employment that offers , and joins a gang of laborers engaged in street railway construction .

		He also studies law , and gets an occasional job of newspaper reporting .

		He is the sort of man who is bound to succeed , and hence we are not surprised to find him , a few years later , a lawyer waging successful warfare upon '' grafters , '' a wearer of 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, judicial robes , and the one man who is chosen by the President to take charge of our island possessions , then recently acquired .

		In the story of his Philippine career is the real sub - stance of the book , for he engages in the work with zest and high purpose , slowly acquires the confidence of the natives , becomes their friend and counseller , sets about providing them with schools , and successfully opposes the humanitarian ideal to the ideal of military harshness in the management of their affairs .

		It will be seen from this brief statement that the author is a believer in '' benevolent assimi - lation '' -- that catchword which at its best stands for iminformed sentimentalism , and at its worst for cant and hypocrisy .

		He seems to have espoused in entire sincerity the '' sacred obligation '' theory of our dealings with the Filipinos , and he does what is possible to genial rhetoric in making that theory seem plausible .

		It is , of course , easy to identify the
Big FeUow	ORGANIZATION	, as far as many of the traits of his character and incidents of his career are concerned , with a certain conspicuous personage of our times , although the drawing is more or less composite .

		But Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's envisagement of the whole problem is essentially superficial , and his mouth - ings about duty and destiny will ring hollow to readers who have followed with anything like close attention the history of our unfortunate experiment in imperialism .

		There is a love interest in the book , as prettily sentimental as the political interest , and the story is very agreeable to read , despite the underlying falsity of its conception . ''

		The Little Brown Brother '' is a story that proclaims by its very title that it has to do with Philippine affairs .

		It is the work of an English - man , Mr.
Stanley Portal Hyatt	PERSON	, who fought in the American ranks at Samar , and knows the scenes whereof he writes .

		Its point of view is the antipodes of that from which Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's roseate picture is painted , for the American writer is on the side of the civil government , whereas the Englishman reserves all his sympathies for the military branch , and treats the civilian rulers as incompetent and even criminal in their methods .

		Mr.
Hyatt	PERSON	's view is urged with great force , and illustrated with vivid pictures ; logically consid - ered , it reduces Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's argument to a sentimental '' frazzle . ''

		If a civilized people is going to burden itself with the rule of savages , it must perforce adopt stern measures .

		As be - tween the imperialism of British tradition , and the imperialism diluted with sentiment of our recent American concoction , it seems fairly clear that the former gets the better of the argument .

		Once admit the general principle that superior races have a right to govern inferior ones , and , as a corollary , the justice of our own wanton subjugation of the Philippine peoples and Mr.
Hyatt	PERSON	's conclusions follow logically enough .

		The Asiatic , whether Indian or Malayan , must be made to '' know his place '' ; his conqueror must '' civilize him with a Krag '' ; since gentler methods are wasted upon him , all talk about '' the little brown brother '' must be stigmatized as pestilential nonsense , and the very mention of humanity must be met with a sneer .

		This standpoint Mr.
Hyatt	PERSON	consistently assumes , and , writing from it , has passed scathing judgment upon our management of the whole wretched business .

		We must not , however , convey the notion that he has written a mere tract ; he has , on the contrary , told a story of absorbing romantic interest , although a story involving so complicated a tangle of faction and motive that it is not altogether easy to understand .

		Of course , neither Mr.
Hyatt	PERSON	nor Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	faces the underlying fact that our original occupation of the archipelago was without any real justifi - cation , and was undertaken in violation of the most sacred principle of our national existence .


France	LOCATION	was the focus of the world 's interest in the years 1793-7 , and things happening elsewhere at that time seem relatively unim - portant in the pageant of world-history .

		Yet the period of the Terror and the young French Republic was one of much excitement through - out
Europe	LOCATION	and even in
America	LOCATION	, which excite - ment was , of course , largely occasioned by the turbulent doings on the banks of the
Seine	LOCATION	.

		In our own country , these were the years of
Washington	LOCATION	's second term , and the years when the French Revolution became an acute issue in American politics -- the years of Citizen
Genet	PERSON	, and
Jay	PERSON	's Treaty , and the
Whiskey Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	.

		All this material , besides much of minor signifi - cance , is utilized in '' The
Red City	LOCATION	, '' a novel by Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, linked at a few points to his ''
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	, '' but quite independent in its interest .

		The hero is a young emigre ^ who does not sulk in his tent , but fits himself into the life of the new country , even becomes one of the smaller cogs in its system of govern - ment , and finds happiness in the love of a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	maiden .

		The story is related with all the deft literary skill to which Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	has accustomed us , and enriched by all the wealth of his minute historical knowledge .

		In French matters , he slips occasionally , for enfantillage is not feminine , canaille does not take a plural .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 457 and a performance by
Mademoiselle Mars	ORGANIZATION	could not very well have been witnessed by an eighteenth-century hero .

		But these are trifles , and in general Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's picture of life , political and social , during the later years of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	's glory as the capital of the nation , is rich and satisfying .

		But we would not be taken as meaning that '' The Red City '' is an archaeological narrative only ; on the contrary , it is a real story of real human interest , and its action is often exciting beyond the limits of
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	sobriety .

		Mr.
George Gary Eggleston	PERSON	, in his '' Two Gentlemen of
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' does not take us as far back in our history as Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, and does not concern himself so largely with public matters ; but the method of the two novels is in so far similar that both rely largely for their effect upon close attention to details , and are written from fulness of knowledge .

		Mr.
Eggleston	PERSON	's knowledge is the product of his own boyhood recollection , and is for that reason the more exact and vivid .

		He writes of the period just preceding the outbreak of the Civil War , and his book is an honest one , although rather commonplace in style and invention .

		It more than redeems the pledge of its name , for it acquaints us with at least three gentlemen of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the finest of the three is the old Colonel , of whom the title-page gives no promise .

		We also have portraits , much after our own heart , of two ladies of
Virginia	LOCATION	, one young and one old , and both of the kind in which it is good to believe . ''

		The Trail of the Lonesome Pine '' is melo - drama , but it is also conscientious and artistic .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	has upon several previous occasions given proof of his quality as a novelist , and of the peculiar sympathy which he brings to the study of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	mountaineer ; but his latest book is even better than its predecessors , for it is more richly wrought and more secure in its grasp of character .

		Its interest centres in the heroine , whose growth from rudeness to refinement is portrayed with nicety of shading and a clear comprehension of the evolutionary process .

		The wilding charm which is hers by nature is not effaced by education or by contact with the outside world , and she returns to her native surroundings unspoiled by culture .

		Once only , we fear that she is going to disappoint us ; for the man who loves her , and to whom she owes her education , has had a hard struggle during her absence and has grown careless of his person and his ways .

		The revelation of this fact is a shock to her , and her gratitude is for a moment in abeyance .

		But this temporary revulsion of feeling soon gives way , and his love is returned in rich measure when she realizes all that he has done for her .

		A mountain feud supplies the melodramatic element of the nai ` ra - tive , and is the basis of its most exciting epi - sodes .

		Of this the author makes an effective psychological use also , as he portrays the struggle between the clan-spirit and the conception of social order , between the personal view and the impersonal one , in the minds of the heroine and her kindred .

		Another main feature of the story is provided by the growth and collapse of an industrial '' boom , '' the account of which is almost as well done as
Theodore Van Dyke	PERSON	's account of a similar happening in
Southern California	LOCATION
a quarter	DATE	of a century ago .

		These are but suggestions of the substance of the book , and of the reasons why it offers so much more than mere entertainment . ''

		The Diva 's Ruby '' completes the trilogy of novels in which Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	has un - folded the career of
Margaret Donne	PERSON	, and even before this story is ended , we can not but feel that the prima donna lags superfluous on the stage .

		The magnate of the nickel trust wins her in the end by promising to build her an opera house in
America	LOCATION	.

		The Greek financier , thus plante la , consoles himself with an untu - tored Tartar maiden who has been wandering over
Europe	LOCATION	in male attire , peddling stolen rubies , and seeking to rim down a certain Rus - sian who has treated her so brutally that she wishes him for a husband .

		Learning that the Russian is dead , she philosophically puts up with the Greek .

		These are among the prepos - terous inventions to which the author resorts in his endeavor to keep alive our interest in '' Fair Margaret '' and her entourage .

		The whole affair is fustian , and will add nothing to Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's reputation .

		A mysterious murder , and a group of char - acters upon each of whom in turn suspicion for the crime is fastened , -- this is a fairly familiar programme , carried out more or less successfully by every writer of detective stories .

		Mr.
Web	PERSON	- ster 's '' The Whispering Man '' belongs to the class of the more successfid , because of the pre - cision with which the parts of the plot are fitted together , and the clock-work regularity of the action .

		When the mystery is cleared up , our surprise is genuine but not violent , for reflection reveals the fact that it has been foreshadowed by a series of carefully calculated incidents , and if we have failed to see their significance it is clearly our own fault .

		This is the method of 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the story as disclosed by analysis ; but the man who tracks the murderer depends upon sheer intuition , and goes straight to his aim without resorting to the laborious process of deductive reasoning .

		The '' whispering man , '' who pre - tends to join in the search , turns out to be the criminal himself ; his vocal affection seems to be an irrelevant matter , attributed to him solely for the purpose of providing the book with a non - committal and alluring title .

		When
Bulwer	PERSON	wrote '' The Coming Race , '' basing it upon his conception of '' vril , '' a means of destruction so potent and far-reaching as to make warfare henceforth impossible , he set the model for a long line of romantic inventions founded on the same general idea .

		The latest of these inventions is '' The Man Who Ended War , '' by Mr.
HoUis Godfrey	PERSON	, and the author 's '' vril '' takes the form of Hertzian waves , which are brought under such control that they may be projected from any distance to fall upon a given object , wiping it utterly and instantan - eously out of existence .

		The force acts upon metals only , which are at once dissipated by its attack .

		Having perfected his invention , the hero -LRB- if we may apply that title to one who works in secret and makes practically no appearance upon the scene -RRB- notifies the governments of the great powers that he will , unless disarmament is effected within a year , proceed to destroy one by one all the battleships of the world .

		The communica - tion is treated lightly enough until the year passes , and then , as one battleship after another is mysteriously annihilated , it becomes a subject of pressing concern .

		The climax is reached when two great navies , arrayed in battle-line against one another , are destroyed before they have got fairly into action .

		Meanwhile , three light-hearted young people , being a brother and sister who are electricians , and a newspaper reporter who is in love with the sister , are engaged in fathoming the mystery , and in tracking the agent of destruc - tion .

		Science , good luck , and inspiration , all aid them in the task , and they are on the point of success when the annihilation of the fleets brings the nations to their senses , and a plan of general disarmament is adopted .

		The ingenious inventor is disposed of at the moment when his figure stands revealed .

		He is , figuratively speak - ing , '' hoist by his own petard , '' since he becomes a victim of the very force which he has wielded for the destruction of others .

		This is a conven - ient outcome , but it would otherwise be difficult to know what to do with him .

		A man unjustly sentenced for a crime of which he is innocent contrives to escape from his
Arizona	LOCATION	prison , and wanders far into the desert .

		He hides in a remote oasis , with a burro for his only living companion , and lives a
Robinson Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	existence for some years .

		Incidentally , he discovers a gold mine in his retreat .

		During this season of solitude , he undergoes both physical and moral regenera - tion ; and when he at last ventures forth into the civilized world , he is endowed with renewed health and an altruistic purpose before un - known to him .

		Then a young woman comes into his life , and makes it worth while .

		As a matter of poetic justice , the scoundrel who had been the cause of the unjust conviction gets his desert , and evidence turns up which clears the name of the hero .

		This is the substance of Miss
Adeline Knapp	PERSON	's '' The Well in the Desert , '' a story in which the rough realism of frontier life in the
Southwest	LOCATION	is curiously blended with delicate sentiment and spiritual motive .

		The combination is effected with singular skill , and the product is deeply interesting , equally so whether we view it as a picturesque and dra - matic recital of incident or as a study of the development of a human soul .

		Essays and General Literature . ''

		Why has the reign of peace and good-will upon the earth been so long delayed ? ''

		asks Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	in the opening essay of his collected pieces entitled , as a whole , '' By the Christmas Fire '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This question the five bright and suggestive essays of the book may in a general way be regarded as attempting to answer , although the fourth , on '' The Ignominy of Being Grown-Up , '' is rather entitled to be ranked as pure literature , delightfully guiltless of a purpose except to amuse .

		The others -- '' The Bayonet-Poker , '' '' On Being a Doctrinaire , '' `` Christ - mas and the Literature of Disillusion , '' and `` Christ - mas and the Spirit of Democracy '' -- chime in very well with this holiday season of peace and good-will and of attempts -LRB- on the part of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	and others -RRB- to promote the happiness of the many and hasten the coming of the millennium .

		But the fortunate ones who , with large means or command - ing abilities , are dealing telling blows at poverty and wrong , are not encouraged in self-complacency .

		The Spirit of Democracy , we read , '' laughs at the preten - tions of the Strong and the Wise and the Rich to have created the things they possess .

		They are not the masters of the feast .

		They are only those of us who have got at the head of the line , sometimes by unman - nerly pushing , and have secured a place at the first

		THE DIAL 459 table ... They are not benefactors , but benefici - aries . ''

		A symbolical frontispiece and other ingen - ious drawings , from the pencil of Miss
Frances Bassett Comstock	PERSON	, adorn the book .

		In a small volume most inviting to bibliophiles not yet so desiccated as their parchment or papyrus treasures , Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	has reprinted sundry short , light , and often amusing pieces in prose and verse that were originally published in various period - icals . ''

		De Libris '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the book 's short and sufficient title .

		Scraps of curious and interest - ing book-chat alternate with exquisite fragments of Dobsonian verse .

		Here are a few headings from the table of contents , to whet the appetite : -- '' Some Books and their Associations , '' '' The Passionate Printer to his Love , '' '' A Pleasant Invective against Printing , '' `` The Books of
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	, '' '' Fresh Facts about Fielding , '' '' Cross Readings -- and
Caleb Whitefoord	PERSON	. ''


Caleb Whitefoord	PERSON	, let us add in explanation , wrote in
1766	DATE	a letter to Woodf all 's '' Public Advertiser , '' complaining of the miscellan - eous , unconnected , and altogether profitless character of newspaper reading matter , and suggesting that more pleasure and quite as much profit could be derived by reading straight across the page , regard - less of column divisions .

		He then gave examples of the sprightly and astonishing news items thus discov - ered in even the dullest sheet : as , -- '' Yesterday the new Lord Mayor was sworn in and afterward toss 'd and gored several Persons . ''

		Delicate line drawings from various sources enliven this enjoyable volume .

		That it is often reminiscent of the eighteenth cen - tury was to be expected from its authorship .

		Quaintly archaic is the sub-title of Mr.
Arnold Haultain	PERSON	's treatise on '' The Mystery of Grolf '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It reads thus : '' A briefe Account of Games in generall ; their
Origine	LOCATION	;
Antiquitie ; & Rampancie	ORGANIZATION	: and of the game ycleped Golf e in particular : its
Uniqueness	LOCATION	; its Curiousness ; & its Difficultie ; its anatomical , philosophicall , and moral Properties ; together with diverse Conceipts on other Matters to it appertaining . ''

		That is a tour de force , surely enough ; but little attempt is made to carry the archaisms through the book .

		It is simply a present-day golf-enthusiast 's enamoured account of the delights of his favorite pastime .

		The half-dozen pages given to '' The Origin of Games '' do not suffice to take one very far back into the investigation of the play-instinct in man ; nor are the remarks on the '' anatomical , philosophicall , and moral properties '' of golf unfathomable in their profundity .

		But the well-conceived and cleverly executed little treatise is amusing , especially to golfists ; and if they wish to own it they should take early action , as the edition is '' strictly limited . ''

		The author , be it noted , is not a Frenchman , despite his name ; he is described as '' an Anglo-Indian by birth , who has been for many years the literary assistant and co-worker of Mr.
Goldwin-Smith	PERSON	, in
Toronto	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		The book , like the series of limited editions to which it belongs , is a beautiful piece of work .

		The delicate banquet of choice literature which Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	sets before his guests every year is always awaited with eager interest by the lever of books .

		This year its pUce de rSsistance is a superb edition of `` The Poetical Works of Oscar Wilde , '' a volume for whose beauty of mechanical production and painstaking editorial equipment it would be difficult to find words of praise that should be ex - aggerated .

		Every detail of this edition is marked by faultless taste , and the volume is a delight to the bookish sense .

		It is , moreover , a definitive edition , for it includes all the poems before published , and two dozen hitherto uncollected pieces .

		The '' Poems in Prose '' are also included .

		There is an editorial introduction , a bibliographical index , and a set of facsimile title-pages of the original editions .

		A portrait , dated
1892	DATE	, is the frontispiece .

		A dozen smaller books are also included in Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's out - put of the present year .

		Of these , none is more welcome than that which gives us
Eugene Lee	PERSON	-
Hamilton	PERSON	's '' Sonnets of the
Wingless Hours	ORGANIZATION	, '' a work that seems fairly assured of a lasting place in our literature .

		Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	's '' The Time of Roses '' is a volume of thirty-five -LRB- Shakespearian -RRB- sonnets , with lyrics interspersed , which quicken our sense of the charm of this delicate melodist .

		Three English poets who have recently died --
Henley	ORGANIZATION	,
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	, and
Francis Thompson	PERSON	-- are rep - resented , the two former by volumes of selections , the last by a single poem , but his most famous one , `` The Hound of Heaven . ''


Wordsworth	PERSON	's `` Immor - tality '' ode is another single-poem booklet .

		The poetry of a primitive age is represented by that fourteenth-century gem , '' The Pearl , '' done into modern English and provided with a critical intro - duction and a bibliography by Miss
Marian Mead	PERSON	.

		The rest of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's offerings are prose :
Hazlitt	PERSON	's '' Liber Amoris '' heads the list , and has for a suitable companion '' Ann : A Memory , '' by De Quincey .

		Then there are `` Three Legends of the Christ Child '' and '' Nature Thoughts , '' being two little books by ''
Fiona Macleod	PERSON	, '' and , last of all , `` Toward Humanity , '' a selection of brief passages from the writings of
Robert G. IngersoU	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the whole , we should say that it would be a difficult taste that could not find satisfaction in some part of the menu which Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	has provided for this season .

		Travel and Description .

		In two large octavos , '' The Rivieras of
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
Gordon Home	PERSON	, and ''
Venetia	PERSON	and
Northern Italy	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
Cecil Headland	PERSON	, the
Mac	ORGANIZATION	- millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	begin a series called '' Old World Travel , '' which is designed to include books on
Italy	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Palestine	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		It is hoped , '' says the an - nouncement , '' that the various volumes will not only prove welcome to the traveller during his visit , and serve as pleasant reminders of bygone days , but will also bring the different districts vividly before the minds of those who are unable to leave home . ''

		The volumes at hand , are well fitted to fulfil this destiny .

		Both are illustrated in color -- 460 THE DIAl ^ -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, clear , brilliant Italian color -- from paintings by Mr.
Home	PERSON	, and both contain also numerous black - and-white reproductions of his drawings .

		Both give -- usually in outline , sometimes in detail -- the history of places described , and both avoid dreary enumerations of hotels , trains , and other mechanical matters .

		Mr.
Home	PERSON	says of the Riviera that it '' may be described as a collection of jewels strung together at irregular intervals on a rough mountain chain '' ; and he deprecates the fact that the English have disregarded the jewels at the east - ern end of the chain , especially the
Gulf of Spezia	ORGANIZATION	, and
Lerici	LOCATION	.

		He conducts the traveller from Mar - seilles to
Pisa	LOCATION	, stopping at every point of beauty , and projecting its present charms against a carefully studied background of the past .

		The stay-at-home reader will perhaps wonder if this background is not too intrusive ; but the traveller who uses the volume on the spot will be grateful for all the facts given .

		Mr.
Headland	PERSON	says of his book that `` it deals in outline with the history , architecture and art of the towns of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	which lie within the triangular plain bounded on the north by the Alps , on the west by the Appenines , and on the east by the
Adriatic Sea	LOCATION	. ''

		Beginning with the Lombard Lakes , '' the Gates of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' he opens the whole region to the appreciation of the art-lover and the traveller .

		He writes delightfully , and his characterizations are so clear and beautiful that they linger in the mind .

		If the additional volumes of the series unite as well as this the artist 's vision with the tourist 's zeal , they will become , as the pub - lishers desire , '' indispensable to the traveller . ''

		Mr.
Frederick S. Dellenbaugh	PERSON	has shown no un - seemly haste to rush into print with his account of the important
Powell	PERSON	exploring expedition down the
Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Colorado Rivers	ORGANIZATION	, in which he took part nearly forty years ago .

		But now , Major
John W. Powell	PERSON	and Prof.
Alvin H. Thompson	PERSON	, the leaders of the enterprise , being dead , and no one else likely to leave on record a full account of this memorable and at times dangerous piece of inland waterway exploration , he at last overhauls his diaries and notes , and collects other related matter , to furnish a substantial and extremely interesting volume on the subject .

		He names his book , '' A Canyon Voyage : The Narrative of the
Second Powell Expedition	ORGANIZATION	down the
Green-Colorado River	LOCATION	from
Wyoming	LOCATION	, and the Explorations on Land , in the Years
1871	DATE	and
1872	DATE	. ''

		The first
Powell	PERSON	ex - pedition was made in
1869	DATE	, and of this , as well as of the second expedition , Major
Powell	PERSON	wrote an official report in his well-known '' Exploration of the
Colorado River	LOCATION	of the West , 1869-1872 , '' which , however , goes into no such details as Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	has favored us with in his work .

		He calls the book '' practically volume two '' of his earlier '' Romance of the
Colorado River	LOCATION	, '' and it might almost as well be considered a supplement to his '' Breaking the Wilderness . ''

		No one could well be more at home in his subject than Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	.

		His illustrations , half a hundred in number , are chiefly from photographs , and are clear and good .

		There is a colored frontispiece of the
Grand Canyon	LOCATION	, and a serviceable index .

		The volume is handsome and strongly made .

G. P. Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's Sons . -RRB-

		Tourists to
Spain	LOCATION	, and also those whose travels are of the fireside sort , will find in `` Southern
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Macmillan -RRB- , as chromatically illustrated by Mr.
Trevor Haddon	PERSON	and described by Mr.
A. F. Calvert	PERSON	, a sumptuous and well-informed handbook .

		It is to the pictures rather than to the letterpress that the modest author himself calls the reader 's appreciative attention , and they certainly are a conspicuous feature of the book , being seventy-five in number , all full-page and all most strikingly colored -- too strikingly , in fact , one might maintain .

		But some - thing must be allowed for impressionism in the treatment of life and landscape in the sensuous , sunny South .

		A few words from Mr.
Calvert	PERSON	's preface will indicate the plan and purpose of the volume . ''

		Few travellers , '' he says , '' have leisure enough to traverse the wide realm of tawny
Spain	LOCATION	in its every part .

		Those who must confine their attention to a single province naturally select
Andalusia	LOCATION	, where all the
Northerner	ORGANIZATION	's preconcep - tions of the South find realization ... The pre - sent volume , mainly the embodiment of personal impressions and observations , is intended partly to supply the place of a guide-book to this part of the
Peninsula	LOCATION	, and with that object I have brought together as much of history , art , and topography as the traveller is likely to assimilate . ''

		The book is uniform with Mr.
Edgar T. A. Wigram	PERSON	's ''
Northern Spain	LOCATION	, '' and is provided with a good map .

		Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	has added a volume called '' ' Great Rivers Described by Great Writers '' -LRB-
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to the numerous compilations she has already made .

		Even to a person who had thought of rivers as furnishing a possible subject for a book , it must be a surprise that there was such a wealth of material to draw from .

		Victor
Hugo	PERSON	's glowing words repeat his impressions of the Rhine and the
Loire	LOCATION	;
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	tells of a trip down the St.
Lawrence	PERSON	-LRB- was he so fair to it because it is more Canadian than American ? -RRB-

		;
Pierre Loti	PERSON	pictures the
Ganges	LOCATION	, Thoreau the
Concord	LOCATION	and the
Merri	PERSON	- mac , and Mrs.
Richings	PERSON	the Irrawaddy .

		All the rivers of the earth which are great either in size or in association are described by competent writers .

		It is a disappointment to find
Mark Twain	PERSON	barred from the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, but perhaps that was a case of '' no bottom . ''

		The accounts are various in character , some statistical and some impressionistic , and they show entertaining variety of style , the height of dignified propriety being reached by Dr.
Timothy Dwight	PERSON	, who notices in the
Connecticut	LOCATION	`` a frequency and elegance of meanders , and an absolute freedom from all aquatic vegetables . ''

		But for all the '' personal importance '' of the mightily flowing streams , the little Oise brings the reader the happiest memories , because it won
Stevenson	PERSON	to sing its praise .

		Fifty excellent half-tones enforce the vividness of the descriptions .

		-- Another volume
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 4 & 1 in the same series is devoted to ''
Switzerland	LOCATION	Described by Great Writers , '' and again shows Miss
Singleton	PERSON	's careful editing .

		The first division of the book deals with the country and the race , the second with their history , the third with Alpine climbing , the fourth is descriptive purely , the fifth sets forth social life among the Alps , and the last is devoted to statistics .

		The names of
Ruskin	LOCATION	,
Tyndall	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and
Victor Tissot	PERSON	are in the list of writers .

		Mr.
Edward Whymper	PERSON	's exciting account of the first ascent of the Matterhorn alone makes the book notable .

		The many half-tone illustrations give beau - tiful views of mountains and lakes .

		Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	disclaims for her fascinating volume on `` Paris the Beautiful '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- any pretense of being a complete study of the city , but says it is '' a little record of the crystalized enchantment of many springtimes and early sum - mers '' spent there .

		It is , in truth , just such a record as actual and would-be lovers of
Paris	LOCATION	will welcome , because it shows the city not only in its outward fairness but in its beauty of intellectual and artistic achievement .

		Nor is it a '' little '' record , for the four hundred pages are literally packed with what one would most wish to know about streets , buildings , paintings , statues , men , and events .

		Most unique and satisfactory of all , it pictures
Paris	LOCATION	in its activity to-day .

		The work that is being done by scientists is reported as if from the laboratory , and that of artists from the Salons of
last spring	DATE	.

		Men like
Rodin	PERSON	,
Richet	PERSON	, the scientist Landor , and many others , are described in connection with labors now in hand .

		Miss Whiting 's spirit is that of enthusiastic admira - tion of the Parisians , whose chief characteristic she considers is '' imaginative intensity '' ; and admiration also of the city , whose atmosphere she finds not one of frivolity and wickedness , but of '' light and color , of the keenest and most sympathetic human response in joy or sorrow , -- an atmosphere , too , that is peopled with lofty visions and with ideals of loveliness . ''

		The volume is acceptably bound in cloth , with a vista of the
Bois de Boulogne	ORGANIZATION	in color on the cover , and numerous half-tone illustrations , many of them from recent paintings .

		The serious-minded go to
Egypt	LOCATION	to see the
Pyra	ORGANIZATION	- mids and study inscriptions .

		But even they -- and still more all frivolous travellers who go to
Egypt	LOCATION	, and elsewhere , for amusement -- will appreciate Mr.
Lance Thackeray	PERSON	's effort to picture and describe ' ' The Light Side of
Egypt	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
George Ade	PERSON	, in a brief but pungent preface , characterizes the book thus : '' For a real picture of
Egypt	LOCATION	-- prop up the dusty antique in the background , put bewildered tourist into foreground , then flood with sunlight .

		This is what Mr.
Thackeray	PERSON	has done . ''

		Crafty dragoman , '' very good donkey , '' and easy - gaited camel are also conspicuous and entertaining foreground features .

		Mr.
Thackeray	PERSON	's comments on his pictures allow none of their amusing implica - tions to escape the eye of the reader , so that his appeal is by no means limited to those who have climbed the Pyramids themselves -LRB- see illustration entitled • ■ ' The Climbers '' -RRB- or engaged in an involun - tary game of cup and ball -- the `` camel 's favorite game . ''

		Especially will it be valuable to persons who are planning to visit
Egypt	LOCATION	in the near future , and are not averse to seeing themselves as others may see them and getting all the possible fun , as well as profit , from the adventure .

		No writer on American birds is more thoroughly at home in his subject than Mr.
Frank M. Chapman	PERSON	, Curator of Ornithology at the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	, and author of several well-known works on the bird-life of our continent .

		His latest book , '' Camps and Cruises of an Ornithologist '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is the fruit of seven years of field work in which , he tells us , he has devoted the nesting season of birds to collecting specimens and making studies and photographs on which to base a series of what have been termed '' Habitat Groups '' of North American birds , for the Museum .

		Two hundred and fifty photographs from nature have supplied pictures for the book ; and in photographing the birds care has been taken to provide a suitable back - ground .

		Great panoramic views , some of them twenty-eight feet in length , have been painted to give in each case the characteristic shore , marsh , prairie , plain , desert , forest , or mountain height , as the proper haunt of the bird or birds before the camera .

		The descriptive matter has , of course , been prepared with equal attention to accuracy , and the whole is a notable contribution to bird lore .

		As long as rivers run down to the sea the Rhine wUl continue to be a favorite stream with travellers and nature-lovers .

		No river is so rich in both natural beauty and historic and legendary association .

		Not even the Tiber or the Thames or the Danube fills so large a place in song and story , in politics and his - tory .

		Mr.
H. J. Mackinder	PERSON	's book on '' The Rhine '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , illustrated in color after Mrs.
James Jar	PERSON	- dine , is a substantial and handsome volume , histori - cal and descriptive , tracing the course of the great river from its origin in the
Grisons	LOCATION	to its many - mouthed discharge in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and bestowing a side glance on some of the river 's chief tributaries .

		Physical geogi'aphy , political history , and romantic legend contribute each its share toward the making of the book .

		The colored views have the merits and the faults of such attempts to catch the hues of nature in the pages of a printed volume ; but some of the plates are at least pleasing in effect .

		The work shows careful study and patient labor , and is good to read by itself or to use as a supplement -LRB- even though a `` colored supplement '' -RRB- to
Murray	PERSON	or
Baedeker	PERSON	.

		The two elaborate maps of the Rhine basin -LRB- northern and southern sections -RRB- and the four simpler charts of smaller districts are valuable additions .

		``
New Zealand	LOCATION	, painted by F. and
W. Wright	PERSON	, and described by Hon.
William Pember Reeves	PERSON	, High Commissioner for
New Zealand	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Macmillan -RRB- , carries us to a land little familiar to general travel - lers , but much written about of late , and sometimes represented as all but Utopian in its admirable labor laws and enlightened manners and customs .

		Mr. 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Reeves	PERSON	takes pleasure in referring to the enviable lot of the
New Zealand	LOCATION	laborer and artisan , and quotes the testimony of Mr.
Keir Hardy	PERSON	, who , '' after a tour round the Empire , deliberately picks out New Zear land as the most desirable country for a British emigrant workman . ''

		The reading matter of the book , divided into seven chapters , deals with country life , sport and athletics , the fast disappearing forests of the colony , the outlying islands , and other mat - ters , with a concluding word to the tourist .

		Seventy - five illustrations , each having as many colors as
Joseph	PERSON	's coat , give an aspect of gaiety to this sober but interesting account of a far distant country .

		A folded map at the end of the book helps to a better understanding of
New Zealand	LOCATION	geography .

		Miss
Anne Rollings	PERSON	worth Wharton has an agree - able way of making her European travels narrate themselves in the conversation or letters of various fictitious or disguised characters endowed with wholesome curiosity and with alertness of observa - tion .

		The characters are also well-read and , in gen - eral , of the literary habit of mind .

		`` An English Honeymoon '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- treats of certain favorite haunts of
England	LOCATION	very much as the earlier '' Italian Days and Ways '' pictured pleasantly a number of scenes and events in the travels of three women in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Walter Leonard	PERSON	, in the later book , is supposed to describe her wedding journey in a series of letters to her friend Mrs.
Allan Ramsay	PERSON	.

		Canter - bury ,
York	LOCATION	,
Warwickshire	LOCATION	,
Cornwall	LOCATION	, the Lake re - gion , the Land of
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, and other districts rich in tradition and historic or literary association , are visited by the happy pair , who also devote some time to their kodak , or otherwise procure a number of very good photographs of scenes visited , and re - produce them for the reader 's benefit in the book .

		It is an attractive volume and written in
Miss Wharton	LOCATION	's best style .

		So acceptable to book-buyers have Mr.
Gordon Home	PERSON	's pictures and descriptions of
Yorkshire	LOCATION	scenes proved themselves that he is encouraged to collect and issue in one generous volume his three smaller works treating of different parts of that largest of the English counties .

		`` Yorkshire '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is uniform in general appearance and in excellence of workmanship with the other similar works issued from the same press .

		It is preeminently a picture - book , having seventy-one brightly-tinted illustrations , as well as a map of the region described .

		The pages given to
Whitby	PERSON	and the adjacent stretches of coast recall
Lowell	PERSON	's love of the old red-roofed town and its abbey , which became very familiar to him in the
last summers	DATE	of his life .

		Scarborough , with its castle , and with its curious story of the mayor who was once tossed in a blanket , is another interesting place .

		Mr.
Home	PERSON	knows well how to give variety of interest to his pages -- pages , too , that are admir - ably printed in the clearest of Scotch-face type .

		The '' Greater Abbeys of
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- receive a worthy tribute in the goodly volume by
Abbot Gasquet	PERSON	, illustrated in color after
Warwick Goble	PERSON	.

		The book is devoted to the history of these build - ings , not to the more frequently considered subject of their architecture .

		If the general reader is not interested in all the details of the revenue and estate of the monasteries in their times of prosperity , he is profoundly glad of a book which brings together the facts of their building -- and alas !

		in most cases of their partial destruction also -- and which holds consistently to the subject with which it intends to deal .

		Canterbury ,
Tintern	ORGANIZATION	,
Westminster	ORGANIZATION	, and all the others , will seem even more wonderful to him when he views them through the ideal perspective of their legendary and historic past .

		The pictures of them in this volume , even of those most patheti - cally '' ruined , dismantled , and time-worn '' are very beautiful , and a possession in themselves .

		Generously illustrated from photographs , paint - ings , and old prints , Mr.
Fredei'ick W. Watkeys	PERSON	's two-volume work on '' Old
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an attractive and serviceable book of its kind .

		The character of the work is more specifi - cally indicated by the sub-title , '' An account of the ancient capital of the kingdom of
Scotland	LOCATION	, including its streets , houses , notable inhabitants , and customs in the olden time . ''

		The outcome , as the author explains in his preface , of a recent pleasant sojourn in the Scottish capital , his book will be a welcome companion to other sojourners and of interest to intending visitors .

		It makes no claim to being exhaustive , nor does it seek to supersede older and more learned historical accounts of the famous city . ''

		Rather , '' says the author , '' has it been my inten - tion to bring before the reader the principal and interesting events in the history of the Old Town which have made her famous .

		With these has been given some account of the manners and customs of her old-time citizens , together with certain details relating to the ancient life of the city , which are not obtainable without considerable research among antiquarian lore . ''

		Wilson and Chambers have been drawn upon for much information .

		Especially inter - esting are the chapters on the
Castle	ORGANIZATION	, the
Canon	ORGANIZATION	- gate , literary
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and the
University	ORGANIZATION	, the old Tolbooth , and old manners and customs . ''


Washington	LOCATION	: the
City	LOCATION	and the Seat of Govern ment '' -LRB-
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a compact , useful , and also ornamental volume from Mr.
C. H. Forbes	PERSON	-
Lindsay	PERSON	's practiced pen .

		History and description , and sufficiently minute details concerning our governmental machinery , are relieved with numer - ous agreeably tinted photographic views of principal buildings and places of interest .

		The pages that treat of journalism in
Washington	LOCATION	, the educational institutions of the city , the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and other matters relating to learning and literature , are especially inviting .

		The chapter on the social life of the capital is also good reading , but -LRB- best of praise -RRB- too short .

		Of importance to the antiquary are the appended reminiscences of one
Christian Hines	PERSON	, who was twenty years old when the city was founded , and died in his ninetieth year , leaving behind him some memoranda descriptive of early
Washington	LOCATION	and its buildings .

		These notes , first
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 463 published in his eighty-fourth year , are now made more easily accessible in Mr.
Forbes-Lindsay	PERSON	's book .

		Biography and Memoirs .

		The fierce light that beats on a throne seldom spares the near relatives of that throne 's occupant .

		Napoleon 's brothers and wives have received their share of attention from the historian , and his mother and sisters are the subjects , collectively or singly , of several French studies in minute biography .

		But in English there has been little attempt to make us intimately acquainted with '' Madame Mfere '' and her three daughters ,
Elisa	PERSON	,
Pauline	PERSON	, and
Caroline	PERSON	.

		Now , however , Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	sees his opportunity and offers us two substantial volumes on `` The Women Bonapartes '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		His previous studies in French female biography have fitted him for his present task , and he seems to have undertaken it with zeal and relish .

		The treatment of his theme is chronological , and necessarily intro - duces many important characters , both male and female , besides the
Bonaparte	PERSON	ladies .

		The events of the period also call for due mention , so that the work is really an account of the life and times of
Napoleon	PERSON	from a fresh point of view .

		The numer - ous portraits and other illustrations are all that could be desired . ''

		Cornish Characters and Strange Events '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- industriously compiled by Mr.
S. Baring-Gould	PERSON	, and adorned with `` sixty-two full-page illustrations repro - duced from old prints , etc. , '' is a volume of nearly eight hundred pages filled with all sorts of curious matter .

		In general arrangement it is a collection of biographies of those Cornish celebrities who have escaped interment in the
National Cemetery	ORGANIZATION	so ably planned and laid out and filled by
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	and his successor in the editorial chair .

		Cornwall 's comparative isolation , as the author remarks , '' has tended to develop in it much originality of character ; and the wildness of the coast has bred a hardy race of seamen and smugglers ; the mineral wealth , more - over , drew thousands of men underground , and the underground life of the mines has a peculiar effect on mind and character . ''

		A forty-thi ` ee-page index conveys some idea of
Cornwall	LOCATION	's wealth in note - worthy characters .

		How the subject could have been more exhaustively treated , the reader of this thick octavo would find it hard to indicate .

		In form and substance it is a companion volume to the author 's ''
Devonshire Characters	ORGANIZATION	and Strange Events . ''

		From the pen of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	's great-grand - daughter , the Hon. Mrs.
Maxwell-Scott	PERSON	of Abbots - ford , there comes a well-written , clearly-printed , and handsomely illustrated biography of `` Madame Elizabeth de
France	LOCATION	, 1764-1794 '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The `` angelic Princess , '' youngest sister of
Louis XVI.	PERSON	, has probably never been so engagingly pre - sented to English readers as now by Mrs.
Maxwell	PERSON	-
Scott	PERSON	; and she has moreover based her narrative on contemporary and other French authorities whose writings , as a whole , have not been available to earlier students in this field .

		The life and times of
Madame Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	are not wanting in dramatically effective incidents , and the writer has turned them to good account , especially in the chapter describing the tragic end of her heroine .

		Fourteen illustrations , four of them colored , are scattered through the book , and an index , a list of authorities consulted , and occasional footnotes are also provided .

		Some people , including Charles Lamb and Mr.
Crosland	PERSON	, cherish a constitutional antipathy for the inhabitants of
North Britain	LOCATION	; but a good many others find something exceedingly winsome in the Scotch character .

		To these others a new edition of Dean
Ramsay	PERSON	's '' Reminiscences of Scottish Life and Character '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , with some very lifelike and often , in a sober , quiet way , delightfully humorous , illustrations in color by Mr.
H. W. Kerr	PERSON	, will be wel - come .

		As a rule , books of jokes are , for uninterrupted perusal , rather tiresome reading ; but this famous col - lection of Caledonian traits and humors and oddities has sufficient body and substance , enough connecting tissue , so to speak , to make it capable of yielding sus - tained enjoyment .

		Not the least remarkable feature of it is its objective and detached manner , even though it is from the pen of a thoroughbred Scotch - man .

		The author recognized -- no one better -- that cautious and canny element in his countrymen which is so often turned to ridicule by outsiders . ''

		Can you play the fiddle ? ''

		was once asked of an unmusical
Scot	PERSON	, and his finely non-committal answer was that '' he couldna say , for he had never tried . ''

		This and all the other peculiarly Scottish idiosyncrasies and obstinacies and whimsicalities are most entertain - ingly illustrated in the book .

		A '' new and revised edition '' of Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	's `` Madame de Pompadour '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , first published six years ago , has made its appear - ance .

		As this is the only formal biography in English of
Louis	LOCATION	XV .

		's accomplished and skilful favorite , it is not surprising that it should run into a second edition , especially as it is written in an agreeable manner and at the same time bears evidences of careful and scholarly workmanship .

		Besides other claims on the world 's attention ,
Madame de Pompadour	ORGANIZATION	was the prime mover in the establishment of the Sevres porcelain works , and in the founding of the
Ecole Militaire	ORGANIZATION	, which in its twenty-seven years ' existence furnished
France	LOCATION	with many distinguished military commanders , including
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		As the author further reminds us , '' she protected
Voltaire	PERSON	and
Montesquieu	LOCATION	, rescued the elder Cr ^ billon from poverty and neglect , encour - aged Diderot and d'Alembert in their herculean labours , and made the fortune of Marmontel '' ; so that , whatever may have been her faults , she has certainly deserved well of the republic of letters .

		A portrait , engraved from
Boucher	PERSON	's painting , serves as frontispiece .

		Holiday Fiction .

		`` The Ruby of Kishmoor '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- gives full play to Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	's gift for inventing wild adventures , while the nine illustrations in color show 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, his matured pictorial art at its best .


Jamaica	LOCATION	is the scene of the story .

		There the splendid ruby of the Rajah of Kishmoor is the centre of a romantic tale in which pirates of the high seas mingle with Quakers from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, mysteriously lovely women , and desperate viUians with one eye , silver ear-rings , or a broken nose to distinguish them from peaceful citizens .

		In the end the ruby goes a-begging , for
Jonathan Rugg	PERSON	turns his back on fabulous wealth and tropical romance to marry a
Philadelphia Quakeress	LOCATION	and live quietly and happily ever after .

		The
Countess Diane	PERSON	, in the novelette named after her , walks barefoot on a Breton beach , is kidnapped and carried off in a motor-car by a terrible Russian Prince , is pursued and rescued by two benevolent American automobilists , one of whom speedily finds himself desperately in love with her , in spite of the ill-fitting peasant costume in which she has disguised herself .

		Needless to say , the tale furnishes plenty of excitement , while colored pictures and decorations by Mr.
John Rae	PERSON	, and a dainty cover , make of it a very attractive gift-book .

		-LRB-
Dodd , Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- No part of General
Lew Wallace	PERSON	's '' Ben-Hur '' could better serve the purpose of spirited illustration than that descriptive of the chariot-race and the events immediately preceding .

		In a thin octavo , en - titled `` The Chariot-Race from Ben-Hur '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- this fragment of the popular novel is republished with four colored pictures designed by Mr.
Sigismond Ivanowski	PERSON	-- not counting the blue-and-gold cover illustration showing the four-horse chariot in full career .

		The frontispiece represents the victorious qtuxdrigce straining for the goal and leaving a con - fusion of inter-tangled rivals in the rear .

		The next picture shows us Ben-Hur leading forth for trial the horses he is to drive .

		Then comes the scene where the memorable wager on the race is accepted ; and finally we have a group of eagerly expectant faces watching in agonizing suspense the progress of the competing chariots .

		Mrs.
Hugh Eraser	PERSON	's `` The Heart of a Geisha '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is the sweetly pathetic story of a Japanese dancing girl , whose wit and beauty saved her lover 's life .

		Colored border designs are gay with lanterns , flowers , and Japanese garden scenes .

		Every alter nate page is devoted to a small picture of some Japanese flower , and a photogravure frontispiece adds a touch of elegance to the book .

		Anthologies and Compilations .

		The success of Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's anthology of English letters , `` The Gentlest Art , '' has inspired the publishers -LRB-
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to issue a companion vol - ume devoted to the productions of American letter - wi'iters .

		Miss
Elizabeth Deering Hanscom	PERSON	is the editor , and the title is '' The Friendly Craft . ''

		The division headings and the titles for the separate letters have a decided Lucas touch , and the choice of material is based on the personal appreciation of the editor that puts Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's work so far above that of the mechanical compiler .

		As for the letters , all patriotic Americans will be proud to find that the epistolary art has flourished so gaily amid the bustle and hurry of the New World .

		Everyone who owns '' The Gentlest Art '' will want '' The Friendly Craft '' to place beside it on his shelves .

		A group of poetical anthologies in dainty bind - ings may properly be counted among the year 's gift editions . ''

		The Rose - Winged Hours '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is the suggestive title that Mr.
St. John Lucas	PERSON	has chosen for his collection of English love lyrics .

		It is not intended to be complete , but is merely , as Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	describes it in the preface , '' a garland of familiar flowers '' meant to appeal to the jaded taste of a public too hurried to cull the flowers of poetry for itself .

		The book is prettily bound in blue and gold , with decorated end-papers .

		-- An anthology that will appeal to nature-lovers and especially to bird-students and lovers is `` The Bird in Song '' -LRB-
B. W. Dodge & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by
Robert Sickert	PERSON	.

		A photogravure of the king of birds forms the frontispiece .

		The poems comprising the collection are , with one or two exceptions , from English sources , the range of dates extending from Shake - speare to
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		-- Many famous poems , from
Gilbert	PERSON	's '' Bab Ballads '' to Hood 's '' Song of the Shirt , '' first saw the light in the
London	LOCATION	'' Punch . ''

		Mr.
Francis C. Burnand	PERSON	has taken advantage of this fact to collect some '' Poems from Punch '' not so well known as those just referred to but well worth knowing .

		His book is issued as a new vol - ume in Messrs.
H. M. Caldwell Co.	PERSON	's '' Remarque Series , '' a popular miniature edition .

		There is certainly no lack of attractive year books for
1909	DATE	.

		Mr.
Wallace Rice	PERSON	is the compiler of two , `` The
Washington	LOCATION	Year Book '' and '' Catchwords of Patriotism , '' both published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & , Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The former is a companion volume to the '' Lincoln Year Book '' of last year .

		The maxims and morals of `` the Father of His Country '' are embellished with marginal sketches in tint , and the cover is adorned with tiny silhouettes of the first President .

		The patriotic '' catchwords '' are printed on pages whose borders show the American eagle , and
Simmons	PERSON	's picture of Liberty forms an appro - priate frontispiece .

		-- `` The
Carolyn WeUs	PERSON	Year Book '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- of `` old favorities and new fancies '' will help to make
1909	DATE	more amusing for almost anyone .

		There are verses , anecdotes , `` twisted '' proverbs -LRB- nonsense and fun for all seasons -RRB- , with pictures by a variety of artists , including Mr.
Oliver Herf	PERSON	ord .

		-- '' Keep up Your Courage '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	,
Lee & Shepard Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the alluring title of Miss
Mary AUette Ayer	PERSON	's book of quotations .

		The sub-title , '' Keynotes to Success '' will suggest the character of its quotations , which , while they are not arranged for special dates , are meant to serve the same general purpose as the regular year books .

		-- '' The Pleasant Thought Year Book '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- is compiled by Mr.
R. J. DuBois	PERSON	, who has gleaned its contents in many delight - ful literary byways .

		The small size of the volume will commend it to many , and its bright cover and clear print will please others .


1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 465 Not the least valuable , though possibly the small - est volume in the year 's crop of Lincoln books , is `` The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln '' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , being extracts from
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's speeches , state papers , and letters .

		The make-up of the volume is exactly similar to '' The Pocket
R. L. S.	PERSON	, '' a fact which attests to the good taste , but scarcely to the originality , of the publishers . ''

		Catchwords of Friendship '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is a collection of two hundred wise and witty sayings about the making , keeping , and value of friends .

		Each page is decorated , and the frontispiece , title - page , and end-papers are printed in two colors , which gives a holiday touch to the little book .


Holiday Editions of Standard Literature	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is twenty-one years since the poet-naturalist -LRB- he was a novelist also , as well as a miscellaneous contributor to periodicals -RRB- ,
Richard JefEeries	PERSON	, died at the age of thirty-nine , leaving an astonishing num - ber of books to his credit , the majority of them deal - ing with those aspects of nature and forms of wUd life with which he had early cultivated a loving familiarity .

		There are now republished , with appropriate illustrations in color , two of his most characteristic and interesting works , '' The Life of the Fields '' and `` The Open Air '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Miss
Maud U. Clarke	PERSON	furnishes colored illustrations for the former , and Miss
Ruth DoUman	PERSON	for the lat - ter .

		The drawing is good , and the coloring some - times shows much painstaking skill , but necessarily has its faults in the printed reproduction .

		How - ever , the pictures do bring back the country air and scents and sounds .

		It was in
1884	DATE	that '' The Life of the Fields '' first appeared in book-form with prefatory acknowledgment to those periodicals from which the several chapters were reprinted .

		The republication now , without date , of this preliminary acknowledgment conveys -LRB- however unintentionally -RRB- an impression of first publication -- to the unwary .

		The reprint is timely ; nature study is in vogue ; and
Jeff	PERSON	eries is almost as pleasant to read as is our own poet-naturalist whose name has long been a household word .

		Mr.
George Alfred Williams	PERSON	, who has already illustrated
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Carol '' and `` Cricket , '' and other selected portions of his works , now turns his skilful hand to the pictorial interpretation of `` The Chimes '' -LRB-
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , providing for this ever-popular Christmas story six full-page illustra - tions in color , four in black and white , and a number of smaller line drawings in the text .

		An introduc - tion fi'om his pen traces the history of the tale from its conception in
September , 1844	DATE	, to its completion in
November	DATE	, its illustration by the four celebrated artists .

		Leech ,
Doyle	PERSON	,
Stanfield	PERSON	, and
Maclise	ORGANIZATION	, and its publication in successive editions , of which the later ones have been illustrated by artists whom he thinks even more in sympathy with the human quality of j
Dickens	PERSON	's work than were the Ulustrators who were his friends and contemporaries .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	has studied his predecessors ' efforts in the difficult task of depicting the
Dickens	PERSON	characters ; and while one would hesitate to affirm that he has on the whole surpassed them , he has certainly given us pic - tures that have character and are pleasing .

		A hand - somer edition of `` The Chimes '' could not well be asked for .

		`` Tales by
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	, '' with colored illus - trations by Mr.
E. L. Blumenschein	PERSON	, is a handsomely printed , wide-margined , but somewhat inflexibly bound volume from the house of
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The words `` Centenary Edition '' on the title-page remind one of the near approach of that wonderful year in which
Poe	PERSON	and so many other celebrities were born .

		Seven of the best known tales are selected , and each is provided with an appropriately weird and horrible picture , both the drawing and the coloring doing their best to intensify the shivers and the shudders of the spellbound reader .

		Especially gruesome is the design accompanying '' The Masque of the Red Death . ''

		The pictures as a whole are like nothing on or under or above the earth , but so are the stories , for that matter ; hence their reciprocal fitness .

		Three of the most popular of the Waverley novels -- '' Ivanhoe , '' ''
Kennilworth	PERSON	, '' and '' The Talisman '' -- have been issued by the
J. B. Lippin	PERSON	-
cott Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a handsome holiday edition .

		Each vol - ume contains twelve beautiful full-page illustrations in color , from drawings made especially for this edition .

		The type is both readable and attractive , the paper of fine quality , and the binding of dark red cloth , with decorations in gold leaf , is rich and appropriate .

		Prefaces by the Hon. Mrs.
Maxwell Scott	PERSON	of
Abbotsford	LOCATION	add to the interest of the edition , which is well worthy of
Scott	ORGANIZATION	's best work .

		Longfellow 's '' Song of
Hiawatha	LOCATION	'' is reprinted in the so-called '' Minnehaha Edition '' by
Messrs. Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are many full-page pictures in tint , besides appropriate headings and decorative initials .

		The canvas cover shows an Indian design reproduced in the gay colors that the Navajo rug-weavers love .

		-- '' Evangeline '' is issued this year as a companion volume to the '' Wooing of
Hiawatha	LOCATION	, '' published last winter by
Messrs. John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Paper and board-covers cleverly simulate birch-bark ; there are dainty decorations in colors , and a lacing of leather thongs adds a further touch of novelty to the little book . ''

		Tennyson 's Love Poems '' is the title of a com - pilation arranged by Miss
Ethel Harris	PERSON	and pub - lished , with illustrations from famous paintings and border designs in tint , by
Messrs. Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over seventy of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's poems are reprinted .

		The cover is attractively designed , but the coloring is decidedly crude .

		Holiday Booklets and Calendars .

		Among the Christmas booklets of serious import , Mr.
Hamilton Wright Mabie	PERSON	's '' Christmas To-day '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- will be sure to find many readers .

		Its theme is the meaning of the old Christmas story for the world of to-day , and it is handled in Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	's accustomed easy and readable style .

		There are 466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, no decorations except on the very attractively designed board covers .

		-- '' The Higher Sacrifice , '' by President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	of
Leland Stanford	LOCATION	, is published by the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Presswork , paper , and board covers are all attract - ive , and the subject , the free gift of one 's best powers to those less fortunate , is well suited to the holiday season , with a new year of life imminent .

		-- President
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	recently made a
Bacca	LOCATION	- laureate address to a class of Princeton seniors on a theme very similar to President
Jordan	PERSON	's : the joy of sacrifice .

		This is now published in a dainty booklet , entitled `` The Free Life '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		-- `` Quatrains of Christ '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is described , in a brief preface by Mr.
Julian Haw	PERSON	- thorne , as a sort of Christian Rubaiyat .

		Not only are the stanzas in form like
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's , but the symbolism is oriental .

		The spirit , however , is quite different , being reverent , virile , optimistic .

		A frontis - piece , cover design , borders , and initial letters espe - cially drawn , are the decorative features .

		-- '' What Does Christmas Really Mean ? ''

		is the suggestive title of a little book whose title-page explains that it contains a '' sermon begun by
John T. McCutcheon	PERSON	, continued by
Jenkin Lloyd Jones	PERSON	, and published for
Santa Claus	LOCATION	by
The Unity Publishing Company of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The
McCutcheon	PERSON	cartoon supplies a cover - design and a frontispiece , as well as a point of .

		de - parture for the text .

		The page borders suggest Christmas greens .

		-- In '' The Sea of Faith '' -LRB-
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Milton Reed	PERSON	shows that there have always been doubts and dif - ferences of religious opinion in the world , and that scepticism is not so modem a disease as one might think .

		His optimistic outlook gives to his essay the appropriate tone for the Christmas season .

		A handful of gift-books of an unpretentious but not unattractive sort must be noticed in a group .

		No one understands the art of writing amusing trifles better than tliat versatile artist-author , Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	. ''

		Cupid 's Almanac and Guide to
Hearti	LOCATION	- culture '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the joint production of Mr.
Herford	PERSON	and Mr.
John Cecil Clay	PERSON	.

		The latter is responsible for half of the daintily colored illustra - tions ; while the other half , the absurd jingles , and the ingenious descriptions of the Proposal Plant , the Hammock Vine , the
Cosey Cornia	PERSON	, and many other flowers and weeds that grow in Cupid 's garden , are Mr.
Herford	PERSON	's .

		-- Mr.
Robert Williams Wood	PERSON	, who last year taught many appreciative readers '' How to Know the Birds from the Flowers , '' has written and illustrated some `` Animal Analogues '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in which the subtle but unmistakable resemblances between the eel and the elephant , the puss and the octo-pus , the P-cock and the Q-cumber , and others , are deftly set forth in Mr.
Wood	PERSON	's char - acteristically bouyant and convincing style .

		-- '' The Smile on the Face of the Tiger '' -LRB-
Bacon & Brown	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the diverting title of a diverting collection of limericks , new and old , the one about the confiding young lady of
Niger	LOCATION	being accorded the place of honor at the head of the list .

		The sources are indicated at the end of the book , the names of well - known '' limerickians '' jostling those of dignified citizens like President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	and Pro- fessor
Arlo Bates	PERSON	.

		-- `` All in the Same Boat '' -LRB-
Life Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , text and pictures by Mr.
James Montgomery Flagg	PERSON	, is a made-to-order gift for any friend with a sense of humor and a European trip to look back upon .

		Diverting quatrains and absurd caricatures depict the familiar types to be found on shipboard , and in some other places too , since the ship is really the world in miniature .

		-- `` The Sim - ple Jography ; or , How to Know the
Earth	LOCATION	and Why It Spins '' -LRB- Luce -RRB- acknowledges Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	as '' editor '' and joint illustrator with Miss
Cecilia Loftus	PERSON	, whose contribution consists of '' imitations of pictures . ''

		The book contains many laughable remarks on an amazingly wide variety of topics , including some delicious bits about President
Roose	PERSON	- velt .

		-- Hitherto Mr.
Robert Seaver	PERSON	has contented himself with illustrating other men 's verses ; but in `` Ye Butcher , Ye
Baker	PERSON	, Ye Candlestick-Maker '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- he has written some quaintly humorous characterizations of old-time types , which are exactly suited to illustration in the antique wood-cut style that he uses so successfully .

		Spelling , print , paper , border-patterns , and binding are all in harmony with the old-style pictures and text .

		-- The Cynic 's Calendar for
1909	DATE	-LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is entitled '' The Perfectly Good Cynic 's Calendar , '' and Mrs.
Ethel Watts Mumford Grant	PERSON	, Messrs.
Addison Mizner	PERSON	and
Oliver Herford	PERSON	have cooperated in its production .

		There is the usual assortment of cyn - ically distorted proverbs , and a new feature in the shape of '' perfectly good prognostications , '' their object being to '' Enable Everyone to enjoy Every - thing without Remorse , Expense , or Indigestion . ''

		-- '' Cupid the Surgeon , '' by
Herman Lee Meader	PERSON	, with pictures in color by '' Pal , '' is a treatise on the fine art of love-making , with full directions for pursuing it to a successful finish .

		Pictures printed in red and a fat Cupid repairing a broken heart on the cover give the decorative touch .

		-LRB-
Altemus Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Two fables , `` The Little Brown Hen Hears the Song of the Nightingale '' and '' The Golden Har - vest , '' both by Mrs.
Jasmine Stone Van Dresser	PERSON	, are printed together in a small volume , with illus - trations in tint , colored page-borders , and cover of Japanese wood-boards with pictorial inset -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Both fables teach the lesson of patient contentment ; the little brown hen knew how to find sweet notes among barnyard noises , and the russet apple-tree hid her sorrow over her green apples that would not redden .

		From Mr.
T. Hasegawa	PERSON	of Tokio comes a delight - ful array of Japanese calendars , all made in
Japan	LOCATION	, and done up in slip covers of Japanese paper or in Japanese boxes .

		The larger calendars are decorated with modern reproductions of rare old prints .

		There is a
Hokusai	ORGANIZATION	calendar , with two prints slipped in so that when the owner is tired of one he may put the other on top ; and a
Hiroshige	LOCATION	calendar to corre - spond .

		A beautiful floral calendar has twelve sheets ,
1908	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 467 one for each month ; and there are twelve street scenes in silhouette in a dainty case that has the effect of a frame .

		For lovers of the grotesque there is a fat and ugly idol , with depending paper streamers which hold the calendar .

		Panel prints make effective calendars , with a decidedly Japanese air about them .

		Booklets of various sizes , printed on crinkled paper , with gay decorations , combine the utility of a calendar with the unique interest attaching to a foreign book .

		Altogether we know of no more artistic calendars than these from far
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Messrs.
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have followed their usual custom in issuing a large and attractive variety of calendars for
1909	DATE	, and a number of pretty wall mottoes and cards .

		The mottoes are most of them illuminated after the style of the old missals , and many of the calendars are in the same style , with Scripture passages or stanzas of poetry on the dif - ferent sheets .

		The ''
Brooks	PERSON	Calendar , '' with selec - tions from
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	's sermons , is a pleasing example of this type .

		Another ''
Brooks Calendar	PERSON	, '' less ornate but more comprehensive , has a pad with a selection for each day in the year .

		The '' Ingoldsby Calendar '' and the '' Mother Goose Calendar '' are very cleverly illustrated in bright eolors . ''

		The Lullaby Calendar '' and '' Our Cats '' will appeal , re - spectively , to lovers of babies and of fluffy angoras .

		The '' Lincoln Calendar '' is timely in view of the Lincoln centenary .

		The '' Madonna Calendar , '' in various sizes to suit different tastes and purses , and the Fra Angelico calendar , are beautiful examples of color-printing .

		And these are only a few among the many titles which the Messrs. Button have to offer .

		The object of the '' Rubric Series '' of
Messrs. Buffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is to reproduce in handy and attract - ive form some great documents not easily obtainable in any desirable reprints .

		Two recent volumes con - tain , respectively , '' The Sermon on the Mount '' and ' * Poor
Richard	PERSON	's Almanac , '' printed , like the rest of the series , in two colors , with marginal borders and pleasing covers .

		Miscellaneous Gift-Books .

		One can imagine no more delightful subject for an artist 's brush than `` The Flowers and Gardens of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Miss
Ella Bu Cane	ORGANIZATION	is the illustrator , and
Miss Florence Bu Cane	ORGANIZATION	furnishes the text .

		The Japanese theory of landscaping is interesting in all its details -- and its details are almost endless .

		Then there are the temple gardens , planted and arranged with reference to their sacred character .

		There are the nurseries where the dwarf trees , in infinite variety of size and species , are grown with infinite patience .

		There are the fav - orite blossoms , -- the plum , the cherry , the chrysan - themum , the wistaria , the lotus , -- each with its especially beautiful gardens and the quaint and charming festivals associated with its blossoming time .

		Surely no excuse is needed for writing a book , -- the first of a popular character , -- about the flora of '' The Land of Flowers . ''

		But if one were needed the pictures would furnish it .

		The artist has chosen her subjects with regard both for beauty and variety of theme , and the resulting color-plates , printed by the finest modern processes , are exquisite .

		As a garden book or a book about
Japan	LOCATION	this one is full of interest .

		A series of books devoted to art and literature , and called the `` Art and Letters Library '' -LRB-
Buffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is inaugurated by three volumes , '' Stories of Flemish and Butch Artists '' by Mr.
Victor Reynolds	PERSON	, '' Stories of English Artists '' by Mr.
Randall Bavies	PERSON	and Mr.
Cecil Hunt	PERSON	, and a new and enlarged edition of Mr.
T. W. Arnold	PERSON	's translation of '' The Little Flowers of
St. Francis of Assisi	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		These initial volumes present excellent examples of book-making , comfortable to the hand as well as delightful to the eye .

		The cover decorations and the title-pages are replicas , in one case from a man - uscript , in the others from books , of the sixteenth century , and arrest attention for their delicate beauty of design .

		The illustrations are many , and are reproductions , either in four-color process or in black-and-white , of famous paintings .

		The two art books aim to present in easily available form the best material from numerous old and bulky his - tories -- a list of which is carefully given in each volume .

		In quality of text , the `` Flowers of St. Francis '' is wholly different , being a direct trans - lation from a pious MS. which records episodes in the '' seraphic life of St.
Francis	PERSON	and his compan - ions . ''

		The present edition contains , besides numer - ous illustrations after
Giotto	PERSON	and others , some quaint drawings from a fourteenth-century manuscript .

		A book of goodly size , and having a quiet elegance of appearance which harmonizes with its subject , is Mrs.
Lillie Hamilton French	PERSON	's `` The House Big - nified : Its Besign , Arrangement , and Becoration '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Seventy-five illustrations show both exteriors and interiors of palatial American homes , most of them in
New York	LOCATION	or on I ^ ong
Island	LOCATION	, in which wealth and good taste have joined to produce the best results .

		The principles which should guide the builders of such homes in planning halls and stairways , in furnishing salons , dining-rooms , and boudoirs , and in selecting fire-places , mirrors , and even lamps , are persuasively set forth .

		Failures in such matters are tactfully treated in words only , while that which is good is emphasized by photo - graphs .

		Lovers of beautiful and spacious houses will find their knowledge and enjoyment increased by the volume , while those who are content with more humble dwelling places can learn from its expert criticism much which they can apply to their own uses .

		A picture-book full of precious memories to most of us has been made by bringing together all the illustrations , eight hundred and sixty-six in number , that were drawn for the '' Household Edition '' -LRB- 1870 -RRB- of Bickens 's works . ''

		Scenes and Char - acters from the Works of Charles Bickens '' is the title of this inviting book , and it is imported by the 468 THE DIAL .

Dec. 16	DATE	,
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	.

		The artists contributing to that widely popular edition of the then lately deceased novelist 's works were
Fred Barnard	PERSON	,
Hablot K. Browne	PERSON	-LRB- '' Phiz '' -RRB- ,
J. Mahoney	PERSON	,
Charles Green	PERSON	,
A. B. Frost	PERSON	,
Gordon Thomson	PERSON	, J. McL .

		Ralston , H. French ,
E. G. Dalziel	PERSON	,
F. A. Fraser	PERSON	, and Sir
Luke Fildes	PERSON	.

		Their designs are reprinted '' from the original wood blocks , '' and they fill a volume of 584 pages , two cuts appearing on a page , for the most part .

		The contrast , combined with a certain general resemblance , between the fantastic caricatures of '' Phiz '' and the more humanly possible creations of
Barnard	ORGANIZATION	is most interesting .

		Barnard , in fact , is the leading illustrator of this edition , having supplied pictures for eleven of the twenty-five separate works , while '' Phiz '' appears only in '' Pickwick , '' and the others in one or in two instances in three works each .

		It would have greatly added to the interest of the volume if other early illustrators , especially
Cruikshank	PERSON	and
Seymour	PERSON	, could have been repre - sented with '' Phiz '' ; but that was not in the plan .

		The scheme was happily conceived , and has been well executed .

		It is timely too , for there seems to be a decided revival of interest , just at present , in the work of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Will Carleton	PERSON	's name carries so definite a connotation that it is unnecessary to characterize a new volume from his pen .

		`` Drifted In '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the rhymed narrative of a journey on a railroad train , with episodic songs developing thoughts by the way .

		One ballad which will start sympathetic vibrations in many hearts is called `` The Auto and the Saint , '' and tells how a mule who had never been known to kick lost his saint - liness at sight of an automobile and kicked it to slivers .

		When the train is stopped by snowdrifts , the passengers make their own Decameron by each telling a story .

		These are various in subject , and all is as whole-souled in character as the people them - selves .

		A number of them , sucli as `` The Merry Tennis Girl , '' '' Farmer
Stebbins	PERSON	at the Rummage - Sale , '' and `` Up-train and Down-train , '' prove that the author 's spirit has kept up with the times .

		In `` The Henry Hutt Picture Book '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- seventy - five of Mr.
Hutt	PERSON	's best drawings are collected from various sources and printed on heavy sized paper in a volume of the ordinary picture-book dimensions -- nine by eleven inches .

		About half of the plates are colored , and they are all extremely clever -- in no invidious sense of the word .

		A biographical notice of the artist , with portrait , is prefixed .

		The apparent ease and the undeniable rapidity with which he has made his way to the front , and has become an illustrious illustrator at a comparatively early age , is set forth in an interest - ing sketch of his professional course .

		To say that the book is almost wholly devoted to the '' Henry
Hutt	PERSON	girl '' -- a type now nearly as familiar , from the pages of '' Life , '' '' The Century , '' ''
Harper	PERSON	's , '' and other leading periodicals , as was the ''
Gibson	PERSON	girl '' a few years ago -- wiU sufficiently indicate its character .

		Notes .

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish '' Specimens of Exposition and Argument , '' a text-book for the guidance of college students , prepared by Messrs.
Milton Percival	PERSON	and
R. A. Jelleffe	PERSON	.


Lafcadio Ream	PERSON	's translation of `` The Crime of '' Sylvestre Bonnard '' forms a new volume in the hand - some library edition of the works of
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	, now in course of publication by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The Redeemed Captive , '' being an account of the experiences of the Rev.
John Williams	PERSON	, taken prisoner by the Indians at
Deerfield	LOCATION	in

George Sheldon	PERSON	, and pub - lished as the third issue of the `` Indian Captivities Series '' by the
H. R. Hunttmg Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	.

		A second volume of piano composition by
J. S. Bach	PERSON	, edited , like the first , by Mr.
Ebenezer Prout	PERSON	, is pub - lished by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their `` Musicians ' Library . ''

		The volume contains sixteen of
Bach	PERSON	's larger compositions , including six fugues , three toccatos , and two suites .

		There is an introductory essay , descrip - tive of these works , and the usual portrait frontispiece .

		`` The Poetical Works of George Crabbe , '' edited by Messrs.
A. J. and R. M. Carlyle	PERSON	, are published in an '' Oxford Edition '' by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		The arrange - ment is chronological , and the text is complete , with
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	's own notes .

		Six hundred double-columned pages of fine print are required for this edition , which will probably remam the standard form of the poet for many years to come .

		Volume VIII .

		of the `` Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society '' -LRB- N. S. -RRB- is sent us by
Messrs. Williams & Norgate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The papers included are nine in number , and one of them , at least , is upon a '' live '' topic .

		We refer to Mr.
G. E. Moore	PERSON	's trenchant analysis of the philoso - phy of pragmatism as expounded by Professor James .

		The papers of Messrs.
R. B. Haldane	PERSON	,
A. Caldecott	PERSON	, and
Shadworth H. Hodgson	PERSON	are notable , if not exactly lively .

		Two monographs recently published in the
Coltunbia University	ORGANIZATION	series of `` Studies in History , Economics , and Public Law '' are distinguished from their fellows by their unusual dimensions , being volumes of five hundred and seven hundred pages , respectively .

		One is a study , by
Miss Bertha Haven Putnam	PERSON	, of '' The Enforcement of the Statutes of Laborers -LRB- 1349-1359 -RRB- , '' and the other is a history of '' The Province of New Jersey -LRB- 1664-1738 -RRB- , '' by Dr.
Edwin P. Tanner	PERSON	.

		Both bear the imprint of Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,

Edwin Burritt Smith	PERSON	'' is the title of a memorial volume now in course of prepar - ation by Messrs.
George L. Paddock	PERSON	,
Albert H. Tolman	PERSON	, and
Frederick W. Gookin	PERSON	, all intimately associated with the man whose life and work are thus sought to be perpetuated .

		The volume will include a memoir and a portrait , besides a selection of a score or more of the late Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's papers on mimicipal government , anti- imperiahsm , and other topics .

		It can not fail to be a work of great interest and value .

		Sir
Edward Creasy	PERSON	's `` Fifteen Decisive Battles of the World '' has been a minor classic of popular history for more than half a century .

		Scholars have spoken kindly of it , although they have taken exceptions to the author 's choice .

		Quebec and
Yorktown	LOCATION	, in particular , should have been included among the fifteen .

		The

		THE DIAL 469 anonymous editor of the new issue of the book -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- has repaired this fault by adding accounts of these two battles , and of six others --
Vicksburg	LOCATION	,
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, Sedan ,
Manila Bay	LOCATION	,
Santiago	LOCATION	, and Tsu-Shima -- fought since the middle of the
last century	DATE	.

		Most of the new chapters are signed by names that represent scientific scholarship .

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers of '' The Illustrated Bible Dictionary , '' edited by the Rev.
William C. Piercy	PERSON	, and making a volume of nearly nine hundred pages .

		The position of the editor is conser - vative , and he tells us that he means by conservative '' that attitude of mind which , while welcoming all ascer - tained results of investigation , declines to accept any mere conjectures and theories as final conclusions , and believes that the Old Testament will emerge with rein - forced authority from the ordeal of criticism as the New Testament did in the last generation . ''

		This should be reassuring to timid souls who may hesitate about domes - ticating this imposing tome .

		Besides the very numerous illustrations in the text , there are thirty-six full-page plates .

		The Church of
England	LOCATION	supplies most of the contributors , and the list is one to inspire respect .
