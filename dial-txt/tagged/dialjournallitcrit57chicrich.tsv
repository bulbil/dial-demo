		Let endless fyalpas still revolve , Who quaffs , no grief shall e'er befall , For he shall dream the dream of Cod , And never non > he dreams at all .

		THIS edition includes , besides a few later poems , three separate books published at different times `` Flowers of Song from Many Lands , '' a collection of poetic translations ; `` A Book of Quatrains , '' both original and translated -LRB- now revised and enlarged -RRB- ; and original verse which first appeared alone under the title of the present volume .

		Epigrams that snap crowd the pages ; the quatrains might well serve as the text of many a longer discourse ; and the descriptions are classically apt .

		The catholicity of the book is marked .

		From the very refinement of philosophy , ancient and modern , to the prayer of an Indian raider for scalps and the sacrificial hymn of the
South Sea Island	LOCATION	cannibals is a far cry , and the transition requires an unusual limberness of poetic fibre , yet each subject in its turn is given the form and atmosphere best suited to it .

		That rhythm and metre are beyond reproach needs no saying .

		The collection is a representative selection of a mature poet 's work , covering a lifetime of emotions and the spirit of many centuries of philosophical wisdom .

BOSTON	LOCATION	From Nebula to Nebula or The Dynamics of the Heavens If at the equator a bullet were dropped from a height of ten miles , it would reach the spot on the
Earth	LOCATION	's surface vertically under It In about one minute .

		Short and straight though this
fall	DATE	might appear to us , the actual path of the bullet would be very long and tortuous , for during the same minute the alighting spot would be carried forward by the
Earth	LOCATION	's axial rotation some 17 miles , the
Earth	LOCATION	, because of her orbital motion , about 1,200 miles , and the System Itself about 800 miles .

		Of these motions contemporary science explains only the first , as being due to the gravitational attraction of the
Earth	LOCATION	.

		The rest It CONJECTURES to be `` projectile . ''

		It occurred to the writer to Inquire whether the explana - tion given of the first motion might not in some way be extended to apply to all whether the
Earth	LOCATION	, the Sun and the System itself may not be FALLING , the same as the bullet and whether the principle of Universal Gravita - tion may not be the aU-sufflcient cause .

		Now , there Is no assignable reason , save the obsolete anthropocentrlc one , why our Solar System should be assumed to occupy the center of gravity of the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	.

		If it does not do so , must It not then , by reason of being unsupported , be falling toward that center ?

		The reasonableness of this view -LRB- which seems to have eluded
Newton	PERSON	-RRB- being conceded , the author proceeds to show mathematically that the process of this mere `` setting down '' of our system to lower levels Is of Itself sufficient to explain dynamically all the rotary motions , axial as well as orbital , of the planets and their satellites , the commensurablllty of their periods and dis - tances , and their various phenomena of acceleration .

		Recurring again to our bullet , we may say with certainty that Its whole corkscrew journey of 2,000 miles In the space of the minute is solely one of gravitational fall .

		28 GROCER-SHOP CRITICISM .

		The metaphor is a homely one , and lends itself readily to satirical comment , but Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	deliberately adopts it for the de - scription of the art of literary criticism , and what he says in its defence may be read in his essay on `` Literary Criticism in American Periodicals , '' which occupies the plaee of honor in the
July	DATE	`` Yale Review . ''

		`` It surely ought to be possible , '' he says , to re - duce the varieties of criticism `` to the terms of a single process , to conceive of criticism as the performance of a single act .

		I ven - ture to call it , as it has often , no doubt , been called before , the act of weighing . ''

		It is difficult to get away from this metaphor , which the author elaborates by describing the way in which a grocer weighs out a pound of butter , and the chorus of excited protests against the very idea of there being such things in criticism as standard weights , stand - ard scales , and competent literary grocers , can not eradicate from our consciousness the deep-lying feeling that it is the business of criticism to estimate literature , to pass judg - ment upon it , to register the facts about it in some sort of objective fashion .

		That THE DIAL has upheld this view for upwards of thirty years is well known to our readers .

		Such foolish vaporings as were indulged in a few years ago by Mr.
Joel Spingarn	PERSON	met with our vehement denial .

		When that icono - clastic gentleman asserted that `` we have done '' with all the old rules and methods , we replied , as Mr.
Perry	PERSON	now replies , that ' ' we have done nothing of the sort . ' '

		We still practice and believe in the grocer 's procedure , although fully aware that `` there is some variation in the grocers ' weights and in the mechanism of their scales ; that there are garrulous grocers who talk when they should be weighing , philosophical grocers who have theories of their business , self-opinionated grocers who declare that they can tell a pound of butter by the eye or by the ` heft ' as accu - rately as if they weighed it . ''

		When it comes to the question of whether the literary `` weighing '' in our periodicals is honestly or skilfully done , it is hard to arrive at an answer which is not darkly pessimistic .

		6 THE DIAL -LSB- Julyl There is an appalling amount of it mostly the chatter of irresponsible young persons who are without the balance of fixed convic - tions , and without the background of that wide acquaintance with literature which is essential to any critic whose words are worth heeding .

		The trouble with most of this writ - ing is that the compensation offered for it is miserably inadequate for the reward of any kind of good work , while the public which it addresses has no real interest in literature .

		As Mr.
Perry	PERSON	says : `` The real difficulty is that these untrained and underpaid journal - ists are producing copy , as best they can , for a public which is genuinely interested in stock-market criticism , in base-ball criticism , in political , social , and economic criticism , and , in a few cities , in musical and dramatic criticism , but which is not very eagerly inter - ested in the criticism of books . ''

		But when , it may be asked , was it ever otherwise with the treatment of literature in the periodical press ?

		Granted that the volume of chatter about books and about the personalities of the authors has become enormously swollen , are not the proportions of wheat and chaff , of bread and sack , about what they always were ?

		Of the critical writing of any past age , we cherish the small fraction that has enduring value , because based upon knowl - edge and insight , while the great mass of ephemeral stuff has been winnowed away , and is now clean forgotten .

		Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's thesis about the inadequacy of American criticism is based upon two texts one from
Emerson	LOCATION	, the other from Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	.

		In
1836	DATE	,
Emerson	PERSON	wrote in his Jour - nal : `` The literary man in this country has no critic . ''

		In
1905	DATE	, Mr.
James	PERSON	delivered a lecture in this country in which he said : '' I do not propose for a moment to invite you to blink the fact that our huge Anglo-Saxon array of producers and readers and especially our vast cis -
Atlantic	LOCATION	multitude presents production uncontrolled , production untouched by criticism , unguided , unlighted , uninstructed , unashamed , on a scale that is really a new thing in the world .

		It is the complete reversal of any proportion , be - tween the elements , that was ever seen before .

		It is the biggest flock straying without shepherds , making its music without a sight of the classic crook , be-ribboned or other , without a sound of the sheep-dog 's bark wholesome note , once in a way that has ever found room for pasture . ''

		Both of these quoted sayings are weighty , but is the case really as serious as they would seem to indicate ?

		At the very time when
Emerson	PERSON	made the entry in his Journal , one
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	was subjecting current lit - erature to a criticism so informed and so penetrating that it has survived alongside of his immortal creative work in poetry and fic - tion .

		And
Emerson	PERSON	himself , who , we are reminded , `` lived long enough to see the first volumes of the
Chicago	LOCATION	DIAL , '' was writing book reviews that we may still read with profit , and that are preserved by virtue of their fine intelligence quite as much as by virtue of their Emersonian authorship .

		Since
1836	DATE	, we have had in
Lowell	LOCATION	and
Stedman	PERSON	two really great critics , and many others that are more than respectable .

		On the whole , it does not seem to us that American literature is noticeably poorer in criticism of the finer sort than it is in any of the other categories which the convenient term of belles-lettres includes .

		It certainly is an unfair method of argu - ment to contrast , as Mr.
Perry	PERSON	does , the im - mense volume of our book production with our slender output of serious criticism : `` If you turn to the newspapers for information about the twelve or thirteen thousand books pub - lished in this country every year , you find , it is true , a heroically compiled mass of book notices many of them composed , in their essential features , by the advertising clerks of the publishers who are trying to sell the books . ''

		But do most of these books deserve any other treatment ?

		Is not this condition a fair illustration of the principle of suum cuique applied to literature ?

		Does not the occasional worthy book find , amid all this welter of `` literary '' scribbling , the worthy judge and the considered verdict ?

		If the reader `` has great difficulty in discovering what new books are worth buying and read - ing , '' is he not in the case of the man who suffers from uncontrolled disease for lack of expert medical counsel , or of the man who is financially wronged for lack of the best legal advice ?

		Among the practitioners of literary criticism taking the term in its most com - prehensive sense there are `` quacks '' or `` shysters '' in numbers quite as great as are to be found in the professions respectively suggested for comparison .

		But we do not , for all that , declare the professions of medi - cine and law to be pretentious failures , and there is no reason why we should discredit the whole profession of criticism because of the follies and ineptitudes committed in its name .

		1914 THE DIAL , Mr.
Perry	PERSON	is so obsessed with the flagrant immorality of the methods of advertising fre - quently employed by publishers that he finds the trail of the serpent the disguised read - ing notice and the puff unashamed in the columns that pretend to contain only disin - terested expressions of critical judgment .

		Un - doubtedly these columns are , in the case of many newspapers , thus prostituted to the service of the counting-room , and no con - demnation of the practice can be too severe .

		But the readers of a newspaper or magazine can not long be deceived by this rank impos - ture , and soon learn to distinguish the honest from the dishonest publication .

		And no array of instances of this sort of confidence game can shake the solid fact that we produce in our country a large body of critical writing exhibiting both knowledge and discernment , the work of men of entire probity , not to be influenced by either sordid or personal con - siderations to stray into the ways of intellec - tual dishonesty .

		There may not be enough of it fully to leaven the whole lump , but there is enough of it to refute the man who , echoing
Emerson	PERSON	, still asserts that `` the literary man in this country has no critic . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE FRIENDSHIPS OF
THEODORE WATTS	PERSON	-
DUNTON	PERSON	, whose death -LRB-
June 7	DATE	-RRB- goes far toward severing our vital connection with the great Victorians among whom he so naturally took his place , must have meant more to him than can be told in words , and must have con - tributed immeasurably to his growth and to the development of his art as poet , novelist , and critic .

		Beginning his young manhood as a solicitor in his father 's office at
St. Ives	ORGANIZATION	, in
Huntingdonshire	LOCATION	, and going afterward to
London	LOCATION	with his brother to gain a larger ex - perience in his hereditary profession , he was inevitably led by his literary and artistic tastes and his love of nature to abandon the law for the more seductive delights of lit - erature .

		Rambles in
East Anglia	LOCATION	and par - ticipation in the careless , nomadic life of the gypsies , helped to determine the bent of his genius and brought him into close friendship with Borrow and
Groome	PERSON	, with whom he is ranked as one of the best interpreters of Romany customs and character .

		Other friends with whom he was intimate as a congenial companion were
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	;
Whistler	LOCATION	he saw almost daily for ten years , but one may question whether anybody could count on the eccentric artist for warm and unbroken friendship , year in and year out , through rain or shine , good fortune or ill ; but the closest and most enduring of
Watts	LOCATION	-
Dunton	PERSON	's friendships were with
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	, and
Swinburne	PERSON	, and the greatness of these names , together with the indifference shown by the author of ' '
Aylwin	PERSON	' ' in the mat - ter of collecting and making more easily ac - cessible the products of his pen , may partly account for the comparative obscurity in which his own name and work have been allowed to remain .

		SHAKESPEARE ON THE FRENCH STAGE re - ceives in some respects a more adequate and faithful presentation than in his own coun - try or
America	LOCATION	.

		The Parisians are having just now what they call a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	sea - son , two theatres offering Shakespeare plays simultaneously `` Macbeth '' at the
Comedie Francaise	ORGANIZATION	, for the first time in the history of that famous playhouse , and `` Twelfth Night '' -LRB- `` La Nuit des Rois '' -RRB- at one of the theatres on the rive gauche and the versions there offered to the public are said to be much less cut and trimmed and adapted than are the stage versions commonly presented to an English-speaking audience .

		For instance , in the
Richepin	PERSON	translation of `` Macbeth , '' the one used on this occasion , the usually omitted second scene of act four , in which Lady Mac - duff 's little boy prattles prettily with his mother and is put to death by one of the murderers , is retained by the actors ; and , in general , there seems to be much less fear of wearying the audience by giving Shakespeare unabridged , untransposed , and untelescoped , than with us .

		Perhaps the French theatre trains time their departure with more regard to the convenience of their passengers ; or is it that the Parisian audience is much less suburban in character than our own play - going public , and can afford to take its Shake - speare uncurtailed ?

		It is reported in regard to the French performance of `` Twelfth Night '' that there is much less liberty taken with the comic parts , much less `` business '' interpolated , than when the play is given in the poet 's own tongue .

		Must it be inferred that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	enjoys greater prophetic honors abroad than at home ?

		AlDS TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING A CENTURY AGO included -LRB- on the principle that the end justifies the means -RRB- legalized lotteries for the benefit of
Harvard College	ORGANIZATION	.

		With the
Widener Library	ORGANIZATION	approaching completion as the latest addition to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's imposing array of costly modern structures , it is inter - THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	esting to glance back at the history of old
Holworthy Hall	ORGANIZATION	, which owes its existence to a successful lottery conducted in the year
1806	DATE	under the authority of the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, as the legislature of that
State	ORGANIZATION	was and still is officially styled .

		That there was some belief , or some attempt to believe , that this method of raising funds for educational purposes was wholly right and proper , is evident from the following adver - tisement of the
1795	DATE	lottery , quoted by Mr.
Benjamin Baker	PERSON	in a recent contribution to the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' `` So great is the demand for tickets in the 2d Class of Har -
vard College Lottery	ORGANIZATION	, that it has become doubtful whether there will be any to dispose of , for several days previous to the 9th of
April	DATE	next , on which day the Lottery is posi - tively to commence drawing .

		The spirit which animated the first settlers of this coun - try to promote useful knowledge , has , if pos - sible , increased with the present generations ; and this is the evidence , That there is scarcely a single one in the community , either male or female , who is not more or less interested in the
College Lottery	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This gem of uncon - scious humor is followed by an equally amus - ing bit of verse : '' The lisping babe cries ,
Papa	LOCATION	, care for me , Pray buy a TICKET and in time you 'll see The pleasing benefit thy son will find , In Learning faithfully to serve mankind . ''

		DESECRATORS OF BOOKS , or , in especial , those who with more or less emphatic markings and underlinings undertake to instruct all subse - quent readers in the merits of certain chosen passages , are scathingly denounced by the
Portland	LOCATION	`` Oregonian , '' which thus classifies the offenders : `` The people who commit this offense fall into three classes : those who use ordinary pencils , those who use indelible pen - cils , and those who use ink .

		The first are worthy of the rock-pile , the second of the penitentiary , the third of the gallows . ''

		This is a nuisance from which the public library has always suffered and probably always will suffer in a world where human nature and pencils coexist .

		Nearly all libraries attempt to spot the offenders by asking borrowers to report any defacement or mutilation that they may discover , and by directing attendants to examine all books upon their return , thus making the latest borrower , unless he himself points out the evidence of misuse upon bring - ing back a book that has been misused , pre - sumptively guilty of any markings or other disfigurements that the book may be found to contain .

		But attendants have not the time , or will not take the time , as a rule , to give the necessary scrutiny to returned books ; and borrowers are equally negligent about con - cerning themselves with what they commonly regard as none of their business .

		We have heard of a library that adopted the practice of inserting in all books of its own binding or rebinding a few blank leaves bearing a printed request that they be used , rather than the body of the book , for purposes of annotation , illustration , or other voluntary contribution on the gifted reader 's part ; but how far the device served its purpose we can not say .

		THE GENESIS OF `` JAMES , '' a new novel that is enjoying no little popularity among English readers at present , contains features of inter - est to readers of whatever nationality .

		Its author , pseudonymously known as '' ``
W. Dane Bank	PERSON	, '' is said to be on the sunny side of forty or thirty-eight , to be exact and to have started in life as an employee in a hat factory near
Manchester	LOCATION	; later he tried his hand at school-teaching , and finally took the road to
London	LOCATION	and became a free-lance in literature .

		`` James '' was written at odd hours , and pictures with a realism that be - tokens personal experience of that whereof it treats the fortunes of a young man who , like the author , has worked in a hat factory and aspired to greater things .

		But of course there can be nothing of an autobiographical charac - ter in the account of
James	LOCATION	's rather ignoble striving for worldly success , and in his ultimate triumph with his incomparable hair-restorer , `` Superbo . ''

		The kind of realism we have here seems to indicate that the author may be an admirer and more or less unconscious imi - tator of Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	.

		But as to this we can pronounce more certainly after gain - ing a fuller acquaintance with ``
W. Dane Bank	PERSON	. ''

		The report that `` James '' suffered four rebuffs before achieving publicity sounds interesting and inclines one to suspect that the book may be something of a masterpiece , though the number of rejections is not quite large enough to turn the suspicion into a certainty .

		THOSE WHO READ THEIR GREEK IN THE ORIGINAL are commonly supposed , and not without reason , to be somewhat above the average reader in intellect and scholarship .

		Whether knowledge of Greek is a cause or a consequence of this superiority , or whether it may not , to some extent , be both , would be hard to prove .

		At any rate , one is interested in what
Dean West	LOCATION	, of
Princeton	LOCATION	, has to say on the supposed influence of Greek studies in securing for the student a high rank in gen -
1914	DATE	-RSB- 9 eral scholarship .

		At
Princeton Greek	LOCATION	is re - quired for the bachelor-of-arts degree , but not for that of bachelor of letters or bachelor of science .

		In the course of an article in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times , '' he writes : `` The bach - elors of arts have maintained a clear lead over the others in all the humanistic subjects , such as philosophy , history , politics , eco - nomics , archaeology ,
Latin	LOCATION	, English , and mod - ern languages .

		They have at least fairly tied and sometimes have led the others in mathe - matics , physics , and geology , and have not done so well in chemistry and biology , though in the advanced courses in chemistry they take the lead at the end .

		The bachelors of science come second , and in a few instances surpass the bachelors of arts .

		The bachelors of letters , as a rule , come third .

		Moreover , the bachelors of arts lead the others every year in the small percentage of ` dropped ' students .

		These are cold , hard facts .

		It is the bachelors of arts alone who have a general and widely sustained lead in scholarship in
Princeton	LOCATION	during the six years in question -LRB- 1907-1912 -RRB- .

		It is not a question of leaving out Latin for all the others have Latin , and in practically the same amount .

		It is clearly and solely the Greek question . ''

		Inconclusive though any reasoning must be from such in - sufficient premises as the foregoing , yet so far as they go these statements are significant and may help in some small measure toward a settlement of `` the Greek question . ''

		THE POETIC WORTH OF THE RECENTLY DIS - COVERED SAPPHIC FRAGMENTS , in which the educated world was bound to take a lively interest , is not rated very high by Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	in a recent ``
Boston	LOCATION	Lit - erary Letter '' to the
Springfield	LOCATION	`` Republi - can . ' '

		As
MJp	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sanborn is almost alone among our men of letters in his practice of reading regularly , with ease and scholarly apprecia - tion , the classics that most of us dropped when we left college , weight attaches to the opinion he thus expresses : `` I fear that these small fragments of the J3olic Greek of the all - admired Sappho may diminish rather than augment her poetic fame .

		So much of them is conjectural , and her diction is so hard to emend , that the quaintness of them will strike the modern ear more than their strictly poetic quality . ''

		Probably a certain predetermina - tion to discover excellence in any slightest fragment of Sappho that may be unearthed influences most critics in her favor , but Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	perhaps shows a disposition to err in the other direction when he dismisses Sappho in these words : ' ' For the instruction of after ages in astronomy , the new Greek text and translation of the manual of Aris - tarchus of Samos on ' The Sizes and Distances of the Sun and
Moon	PERSON	, ' prepared with great historical labor by Sir
Thomas Heath	PERSON	, a for - mer fellow of English
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and pub - lished in
1913	DATE	at the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	, is really more important than the complete works of
Sappho	ORGANIZATION	, if they could be found ; but Sir
Thomas	PERSON	could not make the world think so . ''

		IN AWE OF THE PRINTED WORD , the old-time bibliophile was likely , especially if he chanced to be a custodian of books , to cherish as little short of sacred every volume that once found lodgment on his shelves .

		In contrast to this we have what Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	in the current issue of `` Special Libraries '' calls ' ' the new library creed , ' ' concerning which he writes : `` Select the best books , list them elaborately , save them forever was the sum of the librarians ' creed of yesterday .

		To - morrow it must be , select a few of the best books and keep them , as before , but also , select from the vast flood of print the things your constituency will find helpful , make them available with a minimum of expense , and discard them , as soon as their usefulness is past . ''

		But such is still the librarian 's awe for the printed word , or for that portion of it in his keeping , that the discarding process is as yet slow and timidly tentative ; and the thought of adding printed matter of con - fessedly ephemeral value and for only tem - porary retention is naturally abhorrent to the conservative librarian .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	admits that `` the new library creed '' has thus far been adopted by very few practising libra - rians .

		Its universal adoption , however , unless by some miracle the present flood of print be - comes greatly diminished in volume , is in - evitable in the near future .

		THE EVERYMAN ENCYCLOPAEDIA ARTICLE ON
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of the THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Included in that excellent series of publications known as '' Everyman 's Library '' is a set of twelve volumes entitled '' The Everyman Encyclo - pedia . ''

		It is disappointing to find in the article on ''
Chicago	LOCATION	'' a number of errors , a few of which I feel obliged to call attention to .

		The article in general seems to have been compiled from accounts and descriptions made twenty or more years ago , such as might be found in out-of-date gazetteers and cyclopaedias .

		In that part of the article enumerating some of the important buildings of the city there is a very inadequate account given of the representative 10 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	structures as they exist to-day .

		Several of those included in the list given have within recent years been far surpassed in every respect by finer and greater structures , but none of those built within the
last two decades	DATE	receives any mention what - ever .

		One , at least , has been removed entirely .

		In the list is mentioned the '' Board of Trade , a granite building , with a tower 300 feet in height , '' and though the building remains , the tower spoken of was removed a number of years ago .

		The twin structure , the
City Hall and Court House	ORGANIZATION	, is said to have cost
$ 4,000,000	MONEY	, and '' close to it is the statue of
Columbus	LOCATION	. ''

		Both the build - ing and statue were removed five years ago and a new structure on the same site was completed in
1911	DATE	, costing
$ 10,000,000	MONEY	.

		Among the great libraries no mention is made of the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	, certainly belonging in the front rank of institutions of that character both as to endow - ment and number of volumes in its collection .

		The total area of the parks of
Chicago	LOCATION	is given at 2,000 acres , whereas there are more than 4,400 acres included in the total area .

		No mention is made of the newer parks which have been created within the last twenty years , such as
Marquette	LOCATION	,
McKinley	PERSON	, and
Sherman Parks	ORGANIZATION	.

		; '' Lake Front Park '' appears in the list given , though that name was changed to
Grant Park	LOCATION	many years ago .

		Mid - way
Plaisance	PERSON	is said to have been the site of the World 's
Columbian Exposition	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	; and while this is true in part , the fact is that
Jackson Park	PERSON	was the site of far the most important of the Exposition structures .

		Among the institutions mentioned `` Armour In - stitute '' appears but not
Lewis Institute	ORGANIZATION	, and ''
Hall House	ORGANIZATION	'' is erroneously printed for
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Field Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	is mentioned under its old name , long since dis - carded .

		The water supply , it is said , is '' extremely good , '' which is quite true , but the writer adds that it is '' owing to the construction of a tunnel four miles into
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	. ''

		As a matter of fact there are nine tunnels in existence , one of which , it is true , extends four miles into the lake , though none of the others exceed two miles in length .

		It is said that the '' canal '' -LRB- referring to the
Drainage Canal	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- cost
$ 33,000,000	MONEY	, though the cost to the taxpayers was about
$ 75,000,000	MONEY	, and the end is not yet .

		Treating of the manufacturing carried on here the writer of the article says that '' numbers of harvesting machines are made , '' which certainly seems an odd mode of expression , considering that one company alone turns out some 800,000 ma - chines of that kind annually in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		In that part of the article referring to the grain trade it is said that the total reaches to '' about 3,000,000 bushels of corn , oats , and barley per annum . ''

		Whether the '' total '' refers to receipts or ship - ments , or both together , is not stated , but in any case the figures are grotesquely incorrect .

		The total grain receipts at
Chicago	LOCATION	for the year
1912	DATE	were 322,000,000 bushels , and the shipments 244 , - 000,000 , the difference being the quantity con - sumed or remaining in storage at the end of the year .

		There are later figures than those quoted here , as I am using only such information as was available to the writer of the article when it was published last year .

		In regard to the government of
Chicago	LOCATION	the article says that the mayor is elected for a term of two years , when the fact is the mayor 's term is for four years and has been so since
1907	DATE	.

		The popu - lation of the city is said to be '' nearly 3,000,000 , '' whereas by the last government census it was 2,185,283 , which hardly justifies the expression quoted .

		A little farther on , the population is formally given as 2,815,000 , which it is readily seen is a transposition of the figures shown in the census , an unpardonable error in proof - reading .

		In the historical portion it is stated that
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	was built in
1804	DATE	, an error that at one time was a very prevalent one , but in later years it has been shown conclusively that the true date of this event was
1803	DATE	.

		However , the ''
Encyclo	PERSON	- pedia Britannica '' makes the same mistake , which is mentioned to show that writers of ency - clopaedias are very often careless when it comes to facts about Western history .

		In the bibliog - raphy the author of a certain valuable history of
Chicago	LOCATION	is given as ``
A. J. Andreas	PERSON	, '' a mistake for
A. T. Andreas	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would have been a very easy matter to have avoided most or all of the errors above mentioned , as a few books of reference giving correct infor - mation on all these points were easily obtainable .

		It shows how easy it is to avoid one 's responsi - bilities in such matters by sitting down with some old cyclopaedia article and rewriting or con - densing it without any attempt to revise or bring the information down to date .

		Taking liberties with articles of this kind is a common fault with writers of cyclopaedias and works of similar char - acter , especially those on subjects pertaining to the newer regions of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Writers and editors of such works exercise much more caution when the older cities and localities of the country are under treatment , for it is well known that negligent and loose writing in regard to them will meet with much more prompt criticism than our busy people take the trouble to notice .

		Such an article as this about
Chicago	LOCATION	, with as many errors contained in it as are found there , would raise a storm of protest from the large body of readers found in almost any of our older cities and communities ; but it is taken for granted that the easy way will answer for our more modern city , where , it is perhaps correctly surmised , the few readers who do peruse the articles can not find time in the mad rush of everyday life to pause a moment and demand cor - rections in the interest of accuracy .

		THE CHARACTER OF THE MEXICAN PEOPLE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is a common saying that one must go away from home to learn about himself , and it is equally true that a person who has lived in
Mexico	LOCATION	must consult North American writers in order to learn Mexican ideas and aspirations .

		Poor things , the
1914	DATE	-RRB- THE DIAL 11 Mexicans , do n't know what they want ; they are inarticulate ; we know , and we inform the world !

		In spite of all this , may I having lived in
Mexico	LOCATION	, keeping house , circulating among all classes and especially among peons may I sug - gest that your reviewer , in discussing certain books bearing on
Mexico	LOCATION	, fell into the very common error of reading into the Mexican people aspirations and ideas totally foreign to that very amiable and immature race ?

		The population of
Mexico	LOCATION	consists of some four - teen millions .

		Of these some two million are whites , chiefly Spanish , and the remainder , some twelve million , consists of Indian stock ; Aztec ,
Toltec	LOCATION	,
Maya	LOCATION	, Zapotec , etc. .

		A psychological anthropologist -LRB- or whatever the proper title may be -RRB- would probably call them morons physically adults , mentally children .

		In that respect they are much like our negroes before the war .

		Now , it is a matter of history that many of our good people half a century ago assumed that the negro had high and lofty aspirations for constitu - tional government and political freedom .

		In due time things shaped themselves so that the negro had an opportunity to demonstrate to the world just exactly what his '' aspirations '' were , just what concrete form these longings for freedom , etc. , took .

		As we look back now at the shameless tale of graft , boodle , corruption , blindness to public duty , and wholesale inefficiency , we wonder how the experiment ever came to be tried .

		The reason is simple : we persisted in reading into negro character aspirations and ideals totally foreign to it utterly incomprehensible to them .

		And at the present day , undeterred and unen - lightened by the patent teachings of history , a large part of the American people still persists in the error of assuming aspirations and ideals among a people unable to read and write of which they have not the slightest inkling .

		American and other foreign observers unite in limiting the aspirations of the average peon of
Mexico	LOCATION	to such simple things as a sufficiency of frejoles , tortillas and pan dulce to eat ; a suit of cotton clothes and the inevitable frazada to wear , an adobe shanty with a few sticks of furniture to live in ; an occasional bullfight or shady comedy to witness ; and vague unlimited aspirations for mescal , gambling , cockfighting , robbery , and mur - der when drunk .

		He not only has no aspiration for representative government , just and impartial judiciary , civil service reform , and community altruism , but the very terms are meaningless to him .

		The peon is four-fifths of the Mexican people .

		`` WHAT CHILDREN SHOULD KNOW . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The editorial on `` What Children Should Know , '' in the last issue of THE DIAL , offers food for re - flection .

		You are right , I think , in placing upon the parents much of the blame for the ignorance of the coming generation .

		We depend upon the school to supply our children with culture , and we blame the school if the child does not respond and become educated .

		Doubtless the school is often at fault , but it can not do everything .

		It can teach the lore of books , which it too often does by a cramming process , but after all the child will gain in the home , if at all , that broader knowledge of affairs and that outlook on life which constitutes culture as distinct from book-learning .

		Now , how much are the average parents of to-day doing at home to open the way for this culture ?

		What is the usual conversation at the family dinner table ?

		College-bred parents , who can talk intelligently and interestingly on literature or science or topics of current interest , and who do so at their clubs , spend the dinner hour at home in discussing the burning question of when the calciminer shall tint the parlor ceiling , or ' how the Joneses happened to get that outlandish green auto , or perhaps they eat in preoccupied silence and let the children chatter about anything or nothing .

		Is it any wonder that children in such homes are not vitally interested in the subjects that are given to them at school , or that they fail somehow to acquire an all-round education ?

		You have referred to the ignorance of the mod - ern child regarding the literature of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		I had occasion a few months ago to place two Bible stories in the hands of a class of third-grade pupils in one of the large public schools , as a test .

		Only three children out of a membership of fifty-two had heard the story of Moses .

		A majority had heard in Sunday-school about
Joseph	PERSON	, but many were very hazy concerning him .

		Has the reading of the Scriptures at home been entirely abandoned in these latter days , and is the change of attitude toward them responsible for the condition just noted ?

		IN THE HEART or THE DARK COXTIXEXT .

		* Of late years the wilds of
Africa	LOCATION	have had no lack of visits from eminent explorers , hunters , geographers , ethnologists , anthropolo - gists , zoologists , botanists , and other seekers after things new and strange and interesting in the little-known interior of the Dark Con - tinent .

		The fruits of one of the most notable of these expeditions are offered , so far as they can be offered in a book , in the two handsome volumes describing the operations of the Ger - man exploring party headed by the
Duke of Mecklenburg	ORGANIZATION	in
1910-1911	DATE	, being the second African expedition conducted by this intrepid explorer .

		But although his name appears on the title-page as sole author , not more than one-seventh of the book is from his pen , the remaining six-sevenths being the work of five other members of the party , who were engaged in subsidiary expeditions aside from the main route .

		`` From the
Congo	LOCATION	to the
Niger	LOCATION	and the Nile '' designates in a general way the pur - pose and character of this central-African exploring enterprise , in which its leader con - fined his activities chiefly to the regions of the Middle-Congo ,
Ubangi	LOCATION	,
Lake Tchad	LOCATION	, and the Binue -LRB- or Benue -RRB- and
Niger	LOCATION	rivers , while his aids pushed their several ways eastward to the
White Nile	ORGANIZATION	and up to its confluence with the
Blue Nile	ORGANIZATION	, through the German Congo and
South Cameroons	LOCATION	, and to the islands of Fer - nando Po and Annobon .

		The purpose of all these trips was , of course , to obtain geograph - ical , ethnological , anthropological , zoological , botanical , and other useful information , and to ' collect specimens of animal and plant life in - other words , to enlarge the bounds of human knowledge as to this little-travelled section of the globe , in which a considerable extent of recently-acquired German territory beckoned alluringly to German explorers and scientists .

		Evidences of improved conditions in the
Belgian Congo	LOCATION	were noted by the explorers , though not all the changes observed by them were fully approved .

		We read , for example in the opening chapter : '' In
Boma	LOCATION	we noticed several alterations and improvements .

		The sleeping sickness , which still ravages a great part of the interior of
Africa	LOCATION	, has necessitated the extension of the splendid hospital , and the large palace of the Governor is soon to be replaced by a new building ih the modern European * FROM THE CONGO TO THE

		style .

		Everyone sings the praises of
King Albert	PERSON	of
Belgium	LOCATION	, who has not only generously renounced his very considerable private revenues from the
Congo	LOCATION	, but has himself contributed large sums of money towards the introduction of modern appli - ances , and towards combatting the sleeping sick - ness . ''

		It will be time enough to discuss the promised
Congo	LOCATION	reforms together with their influence on international trade , which is so closely bound up in them , when they have become an accomplished fact and this is still a long way off . ''

		Now , at any rate , contrary to the assertions of biased newspapers , the natives enjoy considerate treatment , not only here , but in many other parts of the
West Coast	LOCATION	, a treatment regarded with grave anxiety by such as really understand negro psy - chology .

		The manner in which justice is admin - istered in some of the chief West African towns , in many cases positively favouring the negroes to an incredible degree , seriously resembles an unac - countable panic .

		Such obvious anxiety not to offend so-called ' influential ' individuals must in the long run have injurious results .

		For natives are quick to recognize timidity , and to take advan - tage of it .

		I could mention several examples bear - ing out this statement only too well .

		Every traveller should consider it his duty to call attention to the need of just but stern government . ''

		The writer regards the economic develop - ment of the
Congo	LOCATION	as `` seriously endangered by the new regulations regarding the treat - ment of the natives . ''

		It is reported , though we need not necessarily be alarmed by the statement , that the profits from rubber-pro - duction have of late materially diminished .

		As the government no longer uses force in collecting the rubber by native industry , the large collecting stations have become useless .

		Plantations now offer the sole means of obtain - ing rubber , but even here there are serious obstacles in the regulations forbidding the employment of unwilling native laborers , so that the early abandonment of these planta - tions seems unavoidable .

		Better that , how - ever , than the perpetuation of a barbarous system of peonage or negro slavery .

		In contrast to that `` just but stern govern - ment '' advocated by the traveller familiar with German methods of administration , na - tive African systems of government and of judicial procedure are certainly feeble and in - effectual .

		In the Mandja country `` the chiefs have absolutely no authority over their sub - jects , the government being highly demo - cratic .

		A chief can not punish any of his subjects , and has no means of enforcing obe - dience . ''

		In the detection of crime , trials by fire or poison are customary .

		A suspected thief is made to hold his hand in the fire , and if it burns him he is declared guilty ; or he may be forced to drink poison , and if he dies of it his guilt is proved , but if he survives he
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 13 is innocent .

		Among the Niellims there is a bee-hive test that serves the same purpose as the ordeal by fire or poison .

		The accused is compelled to thrust his hand into a bee-hive , and if the bees resent the intrusion in their usual manner the suspected one is pronounced guilty , a contrary result causing a correspond - ing verdict .

		But the court is commonly won over by unfair means by the plaintiff ; that is , the bees are irritated beforehand , and hence an acquittal is all but unknown .

		German criticism of rules and regulations in districts controlled by the French is not unnaturally to be found in the book .

		For example , in the
Duke of Mecklenburg	ORGANIZATION	's ac - count of his explorations about Lake Tchad we read : '' The daily loading of the animals was indeed a sore trial of our patience .

		Each ox carries his driver and a load suspended on each side , which must be very carefully balanced to prevent the heavier load from dragging down the lighter .

		This was an almost daily occurrence , so that we became quite accustomed to hear the crash of falling pack - ing-cases , although this did not exactly improve their contents .

		The preparations for starting always occupied at least an hour and a half , whereas well-drilled carriers get ready to march in less than half an hour .

		The animals soon tired and fell on the bad roads , which resembled nothing so much as a frozen and newly ploughed field .

		The overhanging branches , too , pulled down the loads , and thus necessitated halts of varying duration which were very tiresome .

		However , French ` hu - manity ' forbids the employment of native carriers in all districts where they can be replaced by animals .

		Perhaps the happy day will yet dawn in
Europe	LOCATION	when all manual labour will be for - bidden for humanitarian reasons ! ''

		Sharper point is given to this ironical com - ment on French `` humanity '' by the thought - less cruelty of the native drivers toward their beasts of burden .

		But in general we sympa - thize with the negroes in their decided pref - erence for following their own pursuits rather than being coerced into the wearisome office of carrier .

		Among the more interesting discoveries of these explorers may be noted the stone hatchets and hammers found in
Bagirmi	LOCATION	and regarded as `` traces of a far-distant age , '' and also the `` eatable earth '' of the same re - gion a natural product looked upon by the natives as a great delicacy when made into a kind of pudding sauce .

		Here , evidently , is the paradise of which our own clay-eaters dream .

		Further eastward , in
Bahr-el-Ghazal	LOCATION	, there was encountered what might almost be regarded as the long-looked-for missing link ; in fact , several links made their appearance , as described by Captain von
Wiese	PERSON	und Kais - erswaldau .

		Recording his meeting with a venerable old man named Bogpingi , he says that the patriarch related with great pride the history of his origin , which is as follows : '' His great-grandfather ,
Rumbi	PERSON	, had once upon a time lost his way in the great
Congo	LOCATION	forest , and had lived by himself until he made friends with a herd of chimpanzees .

		He made his home with this herd , and eventually married a chimpanzee young lady .

		By this union he had several children , amongst them
Bansira	PERSON	, who was afterwards Bog - pingi 's grandfather .

		Bansira was finally adopted by the
Pambias	PERSON	, and his family has remained with this tribe ever since ; his son was the chief
Gimma	PERSON	, the father of my informant Bogpingi .

		The old gentleman was very proud of having had a chim - panzee for his great-grandmother , and his face certainly confirmed his account of his ancestry , bearing an unmistakable resemblance to my two tame chimpanzees .

		Several times in this country I came across families claiming a direct descent from anthropoid apes , which they regarded as a special honour , and by no means as a disgrace ! ''

		One further notable passage must be given , this time from Dr.
Arnold Schultze	PERSON	's travels in the German Congo and
South Cameroons	LOCATION	, as related by him in the second volume .

		Near the village of
Lau	PERSON	, between
Yukaduma	PERSON	and Assobam , he was visited by a chieftain who gave interesting information concerning the widely-scattered secret society called `` Labi . '' ''

		The most astonishing thing connected with this society is its secret language , understood by all members , and constituting a bond of union between natives belonging to the most diverse and often hostile tribes .

		A Labi member may not kill his antagonist in battle after the latter has proclaimed his membership by means of a few code words .

		Duku , a soldier who accompanied me , belonged to this society , and confirmed the statements of the Lau chief , adding that its members are found among the Yangheres ,
Bokaris	LOCATION	,
Bipalos	PERSON	, and
Kakas	PERSON	, as well as among the Makas and Yebekolles . ''

		No lack of unusual and often exceedingly interesting information is to be found in these generous volumes .

		The colored illustrations and uncolored drawings furnished by the artist of the expedition ,
Herr Ernst M. Heims	PERSON	, are excellent ; and his pen contributes a nota * ble section , `` From
Lake Tchad	LOCATION	to the
Niger	LOCATION	. ''

		Pictures from photographs abound through - out the work , and a good map is inserted at the end .

		The translation , commendable espe - cially for its successful avoidance of the tone of a translation , is from an unnamed hand or hands .

		Some evidences of haste in the preparation and proof-reading and printing of the book are discoverable , as is commonly to be expected in a work issued simultaneously in several languages ; but the substantial worth of this contribution to our knowledge of equatorial
Africa	LOCATION	is not thereby impaired .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		14 THE DIAL -LSB- Julyl Ax EXGUSH MODERNIST .

		* '' Modernism '' is a word which only re - cently has been found frequenting good society with a specific , not to say a technical , mean - ing .

		It would be a moderately good definition to say that Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	is a Modern - ist ; but still only moderately good , for so many Modernists are not what Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	is .

		It may be better , then , to quote Professor
Santayana	PERSON	, from his breezy `` Winds of Doc - trine '' : `` Modernism is the infiltration into minds that begin by being Catholic and wish to remain so of two contemporary influences : one the rationalistic study of the
Bible	LOCATION	and of church history , the other modern philos - ophy , especially in its mystical and idealistic forms . ''

		A little further on he says in his brilliant and slightly unfair way : ' ' The mod - ernist , then , starts with the orthodox but untenable persuasion that Catholicism com - prehends all that is good ; he adds the heterodox though amiable sentiment that any well-meaning ambition of the mind , any illu - mination , any science , must be good , and therefore compatible with Catholicism . ''

		On reading the first half of Mr.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	's `` Men and Matters '' one might not feel the application of the foregoing remarks , for though the papers on
George Wyndham	PERSON	and
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	and `` Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	among the Prophets '' all reveal the Catholic point of view , that view is truly Catholic , undisturbed by any hint of schism , modernist or medievalist ; while the two delightful papers on Disraeli might have been written by a Jew .

		It is in
the second half	DATE	of the volume that the Modernism of Mr.
Ward	PERSON	develops .

		Begin - ning auspiciously with an essay on
Cardinal Vaughan	PERSON	, the unity is broken briefly by ' ' Tennyson at Freshwater . ' '

		Then the burden is renewed , and grows in volume and dis - tinctness to the end .

		The titles alone are elo - quent : `` Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	's Sensitiveness , '' `` Union among Christians , '' `` The Conserva - tive Genius of the Church , '' `` St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	and the Mediaeval Thought , '' `` Car - dinal
Newman	PERSON	on Constructive Religious Thought , '' `` Reduced Christianity , '' and `` Papers Read before the Synthetic Society . ''

		Although there is a formidable ecclesiastical sound to these titles , and indeed not a little ecclesiastical material under them , yet the writer 's sound historical knowledge and mel - low personality , joined with his completely flexible and dignified handling , give them all an interest even to the general reader .

New York	LOCATION	: sistent Catholic book can scarcely be scientific in a modern sense .

		That is , the deductive Aristotelian interpretations made by
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	in the thirteenth century have never been brought into harmony with the empir - ical methods of the twentieth century -LRB- and therein lies the problem of the Modernist -RRB- .

		Science is always heretical and protestant , whatever the bias of the scientist may be .

		Therefore when a scientific person and a non - Catholic to boot reads in Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's Preface that `` the crude theory of ` private judgment ' finds few advocates '' and that `` heresies are of course a danger to the Church , ' ' the audac - ity of this cool conservatism is more startling to him than the last outburst of the highest German criticism can be to the innocent lit - eralist .

		But it will also be extremely salutary for that same non-Catholic to get the view - point of Modernism , not from a priest , but from a Catholic philosopher and man of the world .

		The chapter on `` Union among Christians '' turns a frank face to the great schism in the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		Why are not Catholics as ready as Protestants to cooperate against the common foes of atheism and free thought ?

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's answer is so important as to de - serve full quotation : '' What then is the true import and rationale of the exclusiveness of Catholics ?

		of their slow - ness to amalgamate with other Christians ?

		Why , if they wish to cooperate with others against the common enemy are they not more ready than they actually are to put out of sight points of differ - ence , to join in common worship , to send their children to schools in which the essence of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity is taught , though not the distinctively Catholic doctrines ?

		Why do they seem so slow to recognize that in the great battle for Christian faith , forms of the creed are minor matters com - pared with its essence ?

		The reply may be put in various ways .

		The one which I think best appeals to the modern mind is the view which is illustrated in
Cardinal Newman	ORGANIZATION	's Essay on Development , by his comparison of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	to an organism .

		An organism has many parts perform - ing various functions which can not be regarded as equally important elements in its life-work .

		Yet its power to do its life-work effectively depends on the whole being kept alive and vigorous .

		And for this object functions not directly connected with its most important work are indispensable .

		Cicero 's digestive functions are certainly a very minor matter in our thought of
Cicero	LOCATION	as a world - power .

		Yet they may have played an all-important part in the general well-being without which he would not have left us the writings by which his greatness was established .

		The
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	no doubt claims to be the one indefectible guardian of the Christian revelation .

		Her exclusiveness is largely based on this claim .

		But it has also much of its raison d'etre in reasons which are the condi - tions of efficiency for any organism .

		Her creed
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 and ritual and organization form a complete and living whole .

		Once you begin to tamper with it and to suggest that only those parts of her creed should be insisted on which she shares with other Christians , you threaten the validity of the living organism and the individuality on which its power largely depends . ''

		This would be fine were it not for a defect in the analogy of
Cicero	LOCATION	's `` digestive func - tions . ' '

		Modern history takes very important account of
Cicero	LOCATION	's digestion .

		We are dog - matically certain that life depends to an exces - sive degree `` upon the liver , '' that the deepest tragedies -LRB- such as
Hamlet	LOCATION	's -RRB- have all a phy - siological basis .

		So it is not quite modern to assume that the liver is only obscurely in our minds .

		Furthermore , is there not a sugges - tion of casuistry in the comparison of ritual with such an important part of Cicero ?


Cic	ORGANIZATION	- ero 's baldness or the cut of his toga really had no effect , according to the best informa - tion available , on his influence as a world - power .

		Another passage to the same point seems much more convincing .

		Speaking of one of the distinctively Catholic ideals , the monastic life , as a point at issue for Protestants , espe - cially for Mr.
Kingsley	PERSON	, Mr.
Ward	PERSON	writes : '' Probably far more will be done to check infi - delity by the zeal and esprit de corps of even one among the hundreds of Catholic religious orders than by all that the religion in common between Mr.
Kingsley	PERSON	and the Pope would be likely to effect not because the points in common between them are not the most important ones , but because in the monastic vocation you have the inspiration and the faith that can move mountains , while Mr.
Kingsley	PERSON	and the Pope are not likely to combine so as to create any parallel esprit de corps or self - denying zeal in their followers .

		Zeal is needed as well as truth , heat as well as light .

		Nothing is more important than belief in God .

		Yet a mis - cellaneous collection of theists would probably be comparatively lukewarm and ineffective apostles . ''

		Herein lies the only effective justification of denominations .

		Speaking in terms of formal logic , as you increase the extension of a term or thing you decrease the intention , until finally the meaning grows so thin that it is nothing but skin and bone with not a drop of blood to give it force .

		The gist of Modernism is contained in the two papers , `` The Conservative Genius of the Church '' and `` St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	and Me - diaeval Thought . ' '

		The conservative principle of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	has resulted in the continuous double phenomenon of Resistance and
Assimi	PERSON	- lation .

		`` The palmary instance of this as - similative activity because the change was greatest was the complete adaptation of the - ology to Aristotelian philosophy and to dia - lectical treatment by St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	. ''

		Aristotle 's metaphysical works , condemned by the
Council of Paris	ORGANIZATION	in
1210	DATE	A. D. to be burnt , were `` sifted '' by Albertus Magnus and trans - formed by
St. Thomas	LOCATION	, until in
1254	DATE	they were in the official required list for the
Bach	LOCATION	- elor of Arts degree .

		This lesson from
Aquinas	LOCATION	, Mr.
Ward	PERSON	would have the modern Church learn .

		He says the temper of mind of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries was much like this of the twentieth .

		The material of the intellectual questioning was different ; but the method , the precocious curiosity , was the same .

		Therefore in dealing to-day with secular learn - ing the Christian theologians `` have every - thing to learn from St.
Thomas	PERSON	. ''

		It appears later in this essay that what St.
Thomas	PERSON	did was to join the philosophy of Plato to the method of Aristotle , and Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's immense though natural mistake is that Christian theologians have still only
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	to reckon with .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	knows something of later philosophies , of Pragmatism for instance , but he brushes this last aside as out of court .

		Such a magisterial manner with this potent element in our Zeit - geist argues only fear of the opposition or distrust of his own forces , or both .

		The `` Summa Theologica , '' however keen and effective a weapon in the
thirteenth century	DATE	, needs more than a simple readjustment ; it must have a new handle and some new blades .

		The essays that are without ecclesiastical tang are delightful .

		That on Disraeli flashes light upon so many facets of this sparkling person that the confluence takes on unity and historic truth .

		The treatment of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	is as fine a piece of critical writing upon a difficult and not over-engaging subject as can be found in contemporary literature .

		It is worthy of the early reviewers , of the hand of a Macaulay or the heart of a
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Tennyson at Freshwater , '' though a charming piece of literary chat , curiously misses the mark of its author .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	as a boy had known and worshipped
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and in recounting some homely incidents concerning the `` god of his idolatry '' he dan - gerously assumes that his readers will inter - pret them as sympathetically as he himself does .

		For instance ,
Jowett	PERSON	's remark , `` Ten - nyson experienced a great deal of pain from the attacks of his enemies ; I never remember his receiving the least pleasure from the commendation of his friends , ' ' quoted approv - ingly , may not be considered altogether con - clusive as to
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's imperviousness to flattery , but rather bears witness to a gluttony that no surfeit could satisfy .

		And Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's concluding anecdote has such a doubtful twist as to leave one almost suspicious of his alle - giance : 16 THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	'' He was perfectly conscious of all that he added to the effect of a poem by reading it himself , and I remember on one occasion his reading to Sir
Richard Jebb	PERSON	and myself ' Come into the garden ,
Maud	PERSON	/ working up the passion of the concluding stanzas with extraordinary power , each line in a higher key than the one before it , and then his voice falling suddenly with the last words : ' Would start and tremble under her feet , And blossom in purple and red . '

		He added , as the tears stood in his eyes and his voice trembled with emotion , ' No one knows what Maud is till they have heard me read it . '

		And it was perfectly true . ''

		THE SUSPECTED SHAKESPEARE PLAY-LISTS .

		* In 1842
Peter Cunningham	PERSON	, clerk in the audit office ,
Somerset House	ORGANIZATION	, announced that he had discovered the original manuscript ac - counts of the expenses incurred by the Master of the Revels ,
Edmund Tylney	PERSON	, for the dra - matic entertainment of
King James	LOCATION	.

		The `` find '' consisted of three folio sheets folded into six leaves , twelve pages , which were held together by a thread .

		In this pamphlet three pages are devoted to an enumeration of plays presented before the king at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	in the
winter of 1604-5	DATE	and 1611-12 , among
Avhich	PERSON	are included some of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , with the dates of their production and the name of `` the poet wch mayd the plaies Shaxberd . ' '

		These lists are of the utmost im - portance to Shakespeare scholars , for they throw light on the hotly debated questions of the date of composition of some of the poet 's greatest works , such as `` The Tempest , '' `` Othello , '' `` A
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' and `` Meas - ure for Measure . ''

		Twenty-six years after
Cunningham	PERSON	's startling discovery , the forgot - ten pamphlet was offered for sale to the Brit - ish Museum by a book dealer .

		Sir
F. Madden	PERSON	investigated the matter and , finding that the papers were public property , retained them in the name of the government .

		After a cursory examination , the pages which mention
Shaxberd	ORGANIZATION	's plays were unhesitatingly de - clared to be `` a gross forgery . ''

		Mr.
Bond	PERSON	, Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts , Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, of the
Rolls Court	ORGANIZATION	, and all Shakespearean editors and scholars , so regarded them .

		Speak - ing of pages 3 and 4 of the 1604-5 list , Mr.
Halliwell	PERSON	declared that the character of the ink alone warranted the suspicion that the forgery was perpetrated after
1812	DATE	.

		One of the reasons for this statement was the fact that in
1880	DATE	he had discovered among the
Malone MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		memorandum , not in
Malone	ORGANIZATION	's handwriting , which agrees with the suspected play-list in almost every detail , even as to the peculiari - ties of spelling .

		If the play-list was founded on the
Malone	PERSON	memorandum it must have been made after
1812	DATE	, the year of
Malone	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		Recently it occurred to Mr.
Ernest Law	PERSON	to examine the condemned papers , and he came to the conclusion that the adverse judgment of his predecessors had been too hastily reached and that the questioned accounts were genuine .

		Professor
Wallace	PERSON	, Sir
George War	PERSON	- ner , and others , examined the papers at Mr.
Law	PERSON	's request and confirmed his conclusions ; whereupon he published the results of his investigation in
1911	DATE	in a very readable and interesting booklet entitled , `` Some Supposed Shakespeare Forgeries . ' '

		As might have been anticipated , the little book and its facsimiles attracted the attention of students of
Eliza	LOCATION	- bethan literature the world over , and its con - clusions met with general acceptance .

		There was one writer , however , who was not con - vinced , and who , in the pages of `` The Athe - naeum , '' attacked the questioned documents with great vigor and much learning , even if not with that scientific accuracy that such an inquiry demands .

		The little book now before us , `` More about Shakespeare ` Forg - eries , ' '' embodies Mr.
Law	PERSON	's reply to his anonymous critic ; and it must be admitted that he scores neatly , fairly , and convincingly with regard to most of the points made against the Accounts .

		And yet the present reviewer is not convinced .

		The historic and literary evidence of the genuineness of the 1604-5 and 1611-12 lists is not such as not to leave room for doubt .

		A question of this kind can be settled in only one way , by a properly conducted scientific investigation of the MS. by a professional handwriting ex - pert along the lines so well described and depicted by Mr.
A. S. Osborn	PERSON	in his unsur - passable volume , `` Questioned Documents . ''

		Notwithstanding the many manuscripts Pro- fessor
Wallace	PERSON	has read , he is in no sense a handwriting expert , certainly no more than J. 0 .


Halliwell	PERSON	was .

		That Sir
George Warner	PERSON	`` scrutinized '' the questioned documents and pronounced in their favor , notwithstanding `` a somewhat suspicious air about them , '' proves absolutely nothing .

		The report of Professor
Dobbie	PERSON	, the Principal of the gov - ernment laboratories , stands in a different category ; but unfortunately Mr. Law does not print the report , contenting himself with quoting Professor
Dobbie	PERSON	as saying that the general appearance of the ink is uniform throughout the book , that none of it had faded more in one part than in another , and that microscopically and chemically the ink shows
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 17 identical characteristics throughout the pam - phlet .

		But this by no means puts the ques - tion out of court .

		All who have seen the original MS. , even Mr. Law , have said that there are suspicious features about the ques - tioned pages , such as the general appearance of the writing , the tint of the ink , the pres - ence of the names of the dramatists in the margin , the character of the ink , the punctua - tion , the spelling , etc. .

		Mr. Law should not have rested with the examination of the ink , for there is nothing more certain in modern bibliotics than that it is not always possible positively to deter - mine whether the ink of a suspected portion of a writing is of the same kind as the ink of the unsuspected part or whether the two writ - ings were made with the same ink .

		And when , in the case of old documents , these questions are answered it is important to know whether the suspected forger could have obtained or made ink of that kind , i. e. , whether the for - mula of the suspected ink was known to him .

		It is extremely doubtful whether it is possible to differentiate the age of the ink in a ques - tioned manuscript that is not less than sev - enty years old from a genuine writing three hundred years old , especially if the chemical composition of the two inks was practically identical .

		The present inquiry is one of the most diffi - cult that a handwriting expert can be called upon to decide .

		We have to deal with the question of a simulated holograph purporting to have been written between
1604	DATE	and
1612	DATE	.

		The suspected forger did not attempt to copy , trace , or imitate any particular individual 's handwriting .

		We have , therefore , no standard for comparison , and all that is left us to do is to study the questioned documents for such tell-tale evidences as a forger , unless gifted with superhuman cleverness , is sure to leave in his work .

		Such evidence can be found only in photographic enlargements of the document by direct and by transmitted light .

		Such photographs disclose things unobserva - ble by the keenest eye , such as patching , over-writing , differences in the ink tints , dif - ferences in the pens used , erasures by chemi - cal or mechanical means , underlying pencil lines , breaks in the continuity of writing -LRB- as if the writer were drawing instead of writ - ing -RRB- , retouching , writing over the folds in the paper -LRB- showing whether the writing was done before or after the paper was folded , very important in this case -RRB- , whether tears in the paper were made before or after the writ - ing , differences in line , quality , etc. .

		For these purposes the reduced facsimiles published by Mr. Law are absolutely valueless .

		To have rendered a really important service to letters and to the memory of
Cunningham	LOCATION	, the biog - rapher of
Inigo Jones	PERSON	and
Nell Gwynn	PERSON	, Mr. Law should have provided us with such fac - simile enlargements -LRB- X30 -RRB- of parts of the suspected MSS. , with the full report of Pro- fessor
Dobbie	PERSON	, with natural size facsimiles of parts of the unsuspected MSS. , of the writings of persons who might have had a hand in writing these documents -LRB-
Tylney	LOCATION	,
Swanston	PERSON	,
Cunningham	PERSON	, etc. -RRB- , for it is not impossible that we may some day be able to identify the maker of a few pen-strokes from certain microscopic characteristics as definite as an in - dividual 's finger prints .

		A facsimile of the
Malone	PERSON	' ' scrap ' ' would also be of value .

		A trifling matter to which we must call attention , because of the proneness of so many writers to make incorrect statements con - cerning
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, is Mr. Law 's assertion -LRB- p. 17 -RRB- that the substantive plural plays does not occur anywhere in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works .

SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.

		Ax ENGLISH STUDY or WALT WHITMAN .

		* Ever since its first appearance , the poetry of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	has been received as a chal - lenge to traditional culture , sounding the note of defiance and revolution .

		But his disciples have hailed him also as the discoverer of a new world and a new life which is to replace entirely the old .

		Most readers , perhaps , find - ing in his poetry a genuine and valuable expe - rience , have been bewildered by these extreme claims , unable to accept them or reject them wholly .

		They have found in their very real experience some implications which seemed obviously absurd .

		Such puzzled readers need a work which gives more illumination and less heated rhapsody than the essays on Whitman which we have become accustomed to .

		It is from this critical point of view that the En - glish writer , Mr.
Basil de Selincourt	PERSON	, has writ - ten his stimulating study .

		His purpose has been to analyze
Whitman	PERSON	's poetry , to state its principles positively ; and thus make possi - ble not only a relation of Whitman with the past , but an intelligent estimate of his signifi - cance for the future .

		Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	has devoted about half his book to the difficult problem of Whitman 's art .

		Here the important feature is the aban - donment of metre and the reliance on rhythm alone .

		Since the first appearance of `` Leaves of Grass '' we have of course learned more * WALT WHITMAN .

		A Critical Study .

Basil de Selincourt	ORGANIZATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		18 THE DIAL -LSB- Julyl thoroughly that rhythm is the more impor - tant , and even that great poetry can be writ - ten without metre .

		Nevertheless , since metre helps to make the intended cadence clear to the reader , Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	thinks Whitman , in abandoning it , made a great sacrifice of expressive power .

		For unless rhythm `` is communicated with exactitude , the words are liable to lose their poetic quality and to be - come lifeless . ''

		In the larger matters of construction of line and poem , the author is more sympathetic .

		The basis of construction , it is clear , is the line , each line being complete in itself and containing in germ the personality of the poet .

		By parallelism , by various devices of repeti - tion , line is bound to line to make up a poem .

		The unity of the whole is not at first apparent , and is indeed achieved only by atmosphere , by the personality of the poet , and not by the stricter imaginative or logical continuity .

		This summary of Mr.
de Selineourt	PERSON	's chap - ters , though bald , is perhaps sufficient to justify the statement that in so far as Whit - man is great , `` it is not his daring unconven - tionalities that make him so , though these in themselves are such as to argue greatness of a kind .

		He is great because , having chosen his method , he takes the consequences of his choice with consummate pliability and respon - siveness . ' '

		However , even after deriving from the book itself these principles by which to judge it , the reader finds that
Whitman	PERSON	's work is very - uneven in merit .

		Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	explains that the poet 's power `` varied immensely at different periods of his life ; and being a poor critic of his own writings , he finally arranged them without regard for their poetic value , considering merely in what order the thought of each would be most effective in its contri - bution to the thought of all . ''

		But the stu - dent of Whitman has to realize , as profoundly as
Whitman	PERSON	did himself , that the poetic value of his work is secondary to its thought .

		His perfect lines , indeed , could not alone repre - sent him ; Whitman without his jargon , his bad taste , his absurdities , strange as it may seem , would lose much of his peculiar power .

		The grotesque and ugly does have some strange function in culture , perhaps a lib - erating one ; but its presence in
Whitman	LOCATION	's poetry is explained by that wholesale tolerance and undiscriminating sympathy which he con - sidered a part of the spirit of democracy .

		Whitman ruled out of life the selective prin - ciples of reason and taste .

		The real crux in Whitman criticism is this conception of spiritual democracy .

		If we ac - cept that , we accept everything , crudeness as well as beauty and grace .

		But it is diffi - cult for a young nation to contemplate with religious seriousness its crudities .

		`` Growth is not a delectable word to those whose task it is to be growing .

		There is even a flavour of tactlessness in the use of it under such circumstances . ''

		It is not then so strange that Whitman should have found his most appre - ciative audience over-seas .

		`` Writing for the mechanic , the pioneer , the rough , he forgot that the rough does not understand or care for roughness , craving perpetually to be smooth .

		His primary appeal is to those whose ear he would not have thought or cared to gain , to authors and teachers , to the cultured classes in this old feudal world , to those who are sophisticated and tired of sophistication , to those who are chafing against limitations they must abide by . ''

		What his countrymen can profit by , how - ever , is the courage and insight which could find a place in poetry even for the crude and the rough .

		Whitman believed firmly , and in his remarkable and too much neglected prose writings expressed the idea with great co - gency and power , that democracy must be based on religious character .

		In the future the human race must learn that its aspira - tions to intellectual and artistic culture were at least partial , if not worse , and have too often stood in the way of the deeper and more sacred principle of growth .

		For Whitman , as Mr.
de Selincourt	PERSON	says , `` is the poet of the principle of life , of the pilgrimage and prog - ress of the soul , of perpetual growth and amelioration , of the joy of spiritual growth . ''

		If he finds that all they ask of a heroine is that she be beautiful he may compliantly endow his hero - ine with all the graces he can think of or he may obstinately insist on giving her a squint .

		But whichever the direction of his reaction to those he writes for he does inevitably react , to the result that he adjusts his presentation of his view of life to what he imagines to be their view of life .

		Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	is conscious of the de - mand for heroes and heroines : that is one reason why there are none in his novels .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	never completely forgets that his obligations to his public include that of edu - cating it ; and everybody knows that educa - tion is partly a process of giving plain bread and butter to children who would much prefer cake .

		But this point aside , Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	can - not give us Great Persons because , perhaps , he does not believe in them .

		He is interested in types rather than in individuals ; which is only another way of saying that he is inter - ested in the way our society modifies an ordinary person rather than in the way an extraordinary person modifies our society .

		The formula of ``
Clark	PERSON	's Field '' is precisely that of ' ' One Woman 's Life . ' '

		The difference is that
Adelle Clark	PERSON	is a pale , dull , kindly creature while
Milly Ridge	PERSON	is a pretty , quick , ambitious one .

		Adelle moves among people of wealth in spite of herself , because she inherits
five million dollars	MONEY	.

		Milly achieves a similar place in the world largely by her own effort .

		Oddly enough the story of
Adelle	LOCATION	is the more pleasing of the two ; the vein of it is lighter or the tone is more genial , it would be hard to say which .

		It is a soundly written analysis of the case Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	has chosen and if it only once reaches any height of emotion it contains many entertaining and illuminating passages .

		The chapter devoted to Mr.
Ashly Crane	PERSON	's attempt to win Adelle by the bold bandit method of love-making is perhaps the best of these .

		It should serve excellently for reading aloud in those households where the habit of reading aloud still persists .

		But an Adelle can never arouse the enthusiasm of readers of fiction .

		Her significance is thrust upon her ; she is not important of and by herself ; she is important merely as an exam - ple of our social product .

		It is more than possible , as I have suggested , that Mr.
Her	PERSON	- rick does not believe in persons who are anything more than that .

		If so it is his mis - fortune and ours .

		For nothing less than a heroine could serve to bring out Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's best powers .

		Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	is so interested in the conventional demands of English-speaking audiences that he has , I imagine , written `` Great Days '' as an experiment in social psychology .

		He wondered what the public , or at least the reviewing part of it , would say to an adventure story which was written on the model
G. A. Henty	PERSON	used a hundred times but which recorded the hero 's experience of love a minimum in the same forthright fashion as his experience of war .

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	was unable to divest himself of his outfit of general ideas or of his satirical view of the English upper middle-classes when he came actually to the writing of such a yarn even though he made the period that of
Napoleon	PERSON	's rise , but otherwise he has carried out his plan .

		It is too early to know the result .

		But doubt - less it is foreshadowed in the comment of an avowedly `` radical '' literary monthly .

		This comment is to the effect that `` Great Days '' is ' ' the big rough brother of ' Three Weeks , ' ' which is a sufficiently astounding misstate - ment of the facts to gratify the perverse Mr.
Harris	PERSON	.

		The rest of us will hardly be so pleased .

		For if we are still unable in this country to see that the difference between Mrs.
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	and Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	is a basic difference , we have a longer way to travel toward intelligent appreciation than is pleasant to contemplate .

		It is difficult to say in what respect Miss
Helen C. Roberts	PERSON	has modified her conception of `` A Free Hand '' in order to present it to her prospective audience .

		She has made an earnest , careful , and competent study of a man whom the casual American would un - hesitatingly pronounce a `` dub '' but who is to a degree made interesting by the desire for which
Miss Roberts	ORGANIZATION	has provided a name in her title , as well as by his genuineness .

		Ridley Courage is a dentist , diffident and awkward , who marries a young actress ,
Alison Grant	PERSON	, at a time when she is ill and discour - aged .

		She does not love him ; does not , in - deed , pretend to love him .

		And when , some years later , she finds herself strong again she leaves her husband and their small daughter in order to go back to the stage .

		The author 's sympathy is chiefly with the husband .

		He is of finer , if less triumphant , stuff than his wife ; and being the more complex of the two he is naturally the more interesting to his creator .

		But the reader will be quite as much interested in the woman and will wish for more about her , which illustrates the inherent difficulty of presenting the sort of person who can not justify himself outwardly as well as inwardly .

		Nevertheless ,
Miss Roberts	PERSON	's novel is an excellent one .

		The publication of one as good by an unknown American writer would be an event .

		Our young novelists are not given to expecting so much of their read - ers as Miss
Roberts	PERSON	does .

		20 THE DIAL -LSB- Julyl Mr.
Oliver Onions	PERSON	demands attention as the author of the trilogy of which ' ' The Story of Louie '' was the final volume .

		His `` Gray Youth , '' which is made up of the two novels he has written since -LRB- and which have recently been published in
England	LOCATION	under the titles `` The Two Kisses '' and `` A Crooked Mile '' -RRB- is a `` clever '' book .

		The first part is a satire on the contemporary young woman who thinks herself and her chosen friends an enormous improvement on the generation which bore them , who reads Mr.
Frazer	PERSON	's `` The Golden Bough '' and admires `` the clear-sighted
Wein	PERSON	- iger '' ; the second part is a satire on the wealthy social meddler in this case the young woman herself married , a mother , and possessed of enough money to be dangerous .

		Mr.
Onions	PERSON	could have made it much keener than it is ; at least it is to be hoped that he could .

		None of it cuts very deep and a good deal of it appeals to familiar and established prejudice .

		In a word it is too obvious .

		Mr.
Onions	PERSON	has set up a target on his own private range and that is a pity when there are so many shining marks to shoot at .

		Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	, whose very literary talent continues to occupy itself chiefly with literary figures for the benefit of literary readers , wrote a preface for the English edi - tion of the stories she offers in `` The Return of the Prodigal ' ' in which she asked that they be given the same consideration as so many novels .

		Only one of the stories , `` The Cos - mopolitan , '' which is as long as a brief novel , deserves especial attention .

		It is about a woman who sacrificed herself first to her father surely the deadliest bore in the year 's fiction and later to a cause .

		The story which furnishes the title for the volume is the least happy of the lot .

		The action is well enough but the details are without veri - similitude .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's conception of the inside of a man who made himself a million - aire in the
Chicago	LOCATION	pork-packing industry is possible ; her conception of the outside of him is absurd .

		But there is fun usually cruel fun in some of the literary stories , like `` The Wrackham Papers , '' which Miss Sin - clair understands so well how to do .

		There is even , in `` Appearances , '' enough sentiment to appease the appetite of the American mag - azine editor for whom , no doubt , it was put there .

		Mr.
Knut Hamsun	PERSON	, who tried on two occa - sions to make his way in
America	LOCATION	and found nothing better than a place as a street-car conductor in
Chicago	LOCATION	, has now his revenge .

		His `` Shallow Soil , '' translated into English for the first time this year , is a. novel that few of the Americans he met will ever hear of , but it is also one that hardly one of the Americans he failed to meet has equalled .

		There is real feeling behind it and there is in it the art to make that feeling effective .

		Mr.
Hamsun	PERSON	saw tw r enty years ago or more in
Christiania	LOCATION	a group of young Bohemians poets , journalists , and artists whose power was altogether out of proportion to their merit .

		His ' ' Shallow Soil ' ' is an attack on them , but it is not a propaganda novel in the bad sense .

		It is the story of the loves of four or five young people told with quiet power .

		Such a novel compels me again to ask why it is that they seem to do these things so much better abroad , not only in
France	LOCATION	, where the tradition of prose fiction is so well established , and in
Russia	LOCATION	, but in little coun - tries like
Denmark	LOCATION	and Norw r ay .

		It seems incredible that the normal issue of a decently consistent self should not be the fate of all ; and the suspi - cion arises in some cases that the dividing chasms are not so deep or so real as the sub - jects relate .

		Phenomena of this kind can not be studied in detachment ; as such they may appear to be freakish , but freak is a concep - tion unrecognized by any self-respecting science .

		Dr.
Prince	PERSON	organizes this domain with a more minute analysis of relations than has yet been attempted .

		His distinctions are drawn with rare acuteness ; and the resulting system of interpretation has enduring value ; however subject to modification , it stands as a notable step in the development of the sub - ject .

		Dr.
Prince	PERSON	proceeds upon the principle that the abnormal phenomena are closely re - lated to the normal , the clue to the one is the clue to the other .

		Slight `` faults '' and lapses in normal life both follow and reveal
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 21 the course of more serious fissures of per - sonality as they appear in the distorted world of the abnormal .

		One of the fundamental concepts is that of conservation ; the author 's theory of conservation makes it plain that consciousness holds the key to but a portion of the storehouse .

		The unconscious vaults are essential to the mental economy ; their mode of contributing their supplies is peculiar , and requires elaborate devices to secure their record .

		Reserving the term subconscious for the most general aspect of phenomena out - side the ordinary field of conscious awareness and control , the author makes the uncon - scious the subterranean flow of memories and registrations that affect without emerging to the surface appearance .

		They are written in the primitive operations , the original primary reactions of the nervous system .

		It is when these contributions , together with the sub - consciously held material nearer to the focus of assimilation , become organized and attempt a somewhat independent existence that the term coconscious is brought forward ; it desig - nates a , more or less firmly organized group of responsiveness detached from the central personality and collateral with it .

		That the source of these irregularities of the mind 's coalescence is an emotional one is abundantly clear ; hysteria is the name of the congenial culture-bed in which they grow .

		The mode of their growth is complex indeed , and the layman is soon lost in the intricacies and entanglements of cross purposes and internal strife , to be solved only by the combined dip - lomatic skill and strategy of the clinician .

		To those to whom these problems form a serious study , Dr.
Prince	PERSON	's volume may be recom - mended as indispensable .

		Early life Under the title , `` Early Colle - Tn an English giate Life '' -LRB-
Cambridge	LOCATION	: W. college .


Heffer & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Dr.
John Venn	PERSON	has prepared a volume of addresses , letters , and miscellaneous papers relating to
Gonville	LOCATION	and
Caius College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, popularly known as `` Keys . ''

		As an undergraduate of the college , and now its president , Dr.
Venn	PERSON	has a special sentiment for all the details which he has collected from old records , old bursars ' books , and kindred sources .

		Grouped as these studies are to form a continuous , though informal , history of educators in one of the units of a great university , they are absorbing reading , especially to those at all familiar with collegiate life in
England	LOCATION	.

		The first paper , `` The Memory of Our Benefac - tors , '' gives a very appealing account of various early donors whose gifts of books , windows , plate , braziers , or of pecuniary helps for poor scholars have been allowed to suffer neglect or loss of personal tradition at the hands of their academic heirs .

		Vividly , and with a fine spirit of appreciation , this living master calls the roll of the early stu - dents , fellows , and patrons of the college , and brings back from oblivion many a brief tale of devotion to academic institution .

		The accounts of pre-Reformation days , from the founding in
1348	DATE	until the monks were ban - ished , bring very close to us the actual life of the young men who with icy fingers con - sulted the huge folios chained to the read - ing desk , as they sought to amass material for their learned disputations .

		We see the students at `` commons '' listening drearily enough to the voice of the clerk appointed to read aloud some religious treatise during meal time .

		The close relationship between monastic life and college life is pictured all along , and especially in the chapter `` Monks in
College	LOCATION	, ' ' where Dr.
Venn	PERSON	accounts for the presence of so many young men from the monasteries .

		They were selected by prior or abbot because of some special promise , and were sent to the university to gain that knowledge of Divinity or of
Canon	ORGANIZATION	or Civil Law which would enable them to transact business with prelates or with high secular authorities , when the monastery needed trained and shrewd judgment .

		Some of these young monks were elevated to posts of great distinction in later life .

		A more cheerful note in scholastic life is to be observed when , in
1580	DATE	, drastic rules about `` fote-ball '' were drawn up , and any student caught playing this game with students of other colleges was in danger of being `` openly corrected with the rod in the common schools by some of the
University	ORGANIZATION	officers . ''

		In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the amenities of life oc - cupied more time , as may be seen in the let - ters written by young gentlemen who show much concern regarding their apparel .

		`` I have sent you mine hatcase that you may send up my new hat : I have very much need on it . ' '

		The last chapter is a most interesting account of the routine of college life sixtj r years ago .

		With its brief bits of biography , its glimpses into a hidden past , its reconstruc - tion of ancient life , the volume gives a very sympathetic introduction to a great founda - tion .

		The enterprise , energy , and suc - .

		cess of a young widow who , with her two-year-old daughter , went out to the Far West , filed a homesteader 's claim , and by her achievements added so many feathers to her cap that , as she ex - pressed it , she felt as if she were wearing a 22 THE DIAL -LSB- Julyl feather duster on her head , are related in racy , idiomatic , unstudied style by the hero - ine herself in a series of letters to a friend , written in the midst of the new experiences and with manifest guiltlessness of ulterior designs on the writer 's part toward the read - ing public .

		These `` Letters of a Woman Homesteader '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are signed at first , ``
Elinore Rupert	PERSON	, '' but before a year is out the confession is made that within six weeks of the homesteader 's arrival at Burnt Fork ,
Wyoming	LOCATION	, the scene of the narrative , she had allowed herself to be wooed and won by the worthy and , we will add , discerning Scot whose homestead adjoined the one that was ere long to be hers , and who had engaged her services as housekeeper ; and after this interesting confession she signs herself by her new name , which appears on the title-page as ``
Elinore Pruitt Stewart	PERSON	, ''
Pruit	PERSON	being , as she explains in one of her letters , her patro - nymic .

		One suspects that the canny Scots - man 's quick surrender to her charms was partly effected by her display of a remarka - ble range and variety of useful accomplish - ments .

		She delighted him by her ability to run the mowing machine and to milk the cows no less than by her efficiency as cook and laundress and dairy maid ; for she had early been left an orphan in the Indian Territory , and had learned farming as well as house - keeping .

		Small wonder , then , that though she had never had a day 's schooling , she was equal to the task of learning to write , and that finally she wrote such letters that `` The At - lantic Monthly '' was glad to publish them when by some kind providence they were brought to the editor 's attention ; and those letters , now collected in a book , give promise of attaining no inconsiderable fame in the literary world .

		They are , indeed , an example of that variety of the unexpected which make it worth while to be an editor .

		Mrs.
Stewart	PERSON	's enthusiasm for homesteading is infectious , as are also the high spirits and jollity of her admirable letters .

		Her neighbors are made to live and breathe before our eyes as she hits off their various peculiarities and amiabili - ties ; to their faults and foibles , if they have any , she makes no allusion .

		It is a hearty and wholesome book .

		Six good drawings accom - pany the reading matter .

		Problems of immigration .

		There has been issued recently a third edition , revised and en - larged , of `` The Immigration Problem '' -LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Jeremiah W. Jenks	PERSON	and Mr.
W. Jett Lauek	PERSON	.

		In its original form the book possessed distinct qualities of superiority .

		Its authors , both of whom are recognized as experts in the fields of economics and social legislation , were as - sociated with Senator
Dillingham	PERSON	's
Immigra	LOCATION	- tion
Commission	ORGANIZATION	throughout the four years of its researches , and in their book they in - corporated the most authentic and significant information contained in the forty-two mas - sive volumes of material which the Commis - sion published .

		They wrote , not as advocates , but as recorders and interpreters of facts .

		In the present edition the subject matter is brought up to date , with the aid of the census of
1910	DATE	and of the most recent reports of the
Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many chapters , including that on Recent Im - migrants in Agriculture , have been rewritten , and new tables , charts , and texts of legisla - tive measures notably the literacy-test sec - tion of the Dillingham-Burnett Bill vetoed by President
Taft	PERSON	in
February , 1913	DATE	, and the
California	LOCATION	Alien Land Ownership Act of
May , 1913	DATE	have been added .

		In their first edi - tion the authors declared for a more effec - tive restriction of immigration and suggested as the most desirable mode the imposition of an educational test .

		In the new edition they take occasion to lay added stress upon these recommendations .

		They say that a policy of permanent or absolute exclusion is not im - perative .

		But they maintain that if the influx of immigrant wage-earners shall be allowed to continue at its present rate there is `` no ground for expecting any noteworthy improvement in the near future in the work - ing and living conditions of the employees of our mines and factories . ''

		Admitting that the adoption of a policy of restriction might be attended by a temporary check in the rapidity of the remarkable industrial expan - sion of the last few years , they remind the reader , in a convincing manner , that the true measure of the economic welfare of the citi - zens of an industrial and commercial nation does not consist in the number of tons of coal produced or the tons of pig iron , steel rails , or yards of print cloth manufactured .

		The present situation is declared to be developing social and political dangers which demand immediate action .

		Coming from the average writer upon the immigration problem , an assertion of this nature might well be dis - counted .

		Coming from students of the well - known sanity and judiciousness of Messrs.
Jenks	PERSON	and
Lauck	PERSON	, the declaration merits the reflection of every serious-minded citizen .

		With respect to the immigration of Oriental peoples , it is maintained that the country 's present policy is entirely justifiable , although it is pointed out that the form of selection might well be modified `` so as not to wound the national susceptibilities of any people . ''

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 23
Chelsea	ORGANIZATION	' Blunt has made celebrities himself an authority on
Chelsea	LOCATION	, major and minor .

		itg h is toly an -LRB- J traditions , its greater and lesser celebrities .

		His latest work on his favorite theme bears the title , `` In Cheyne Walk and Thereabout '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and presents to view some of the less familiar characters and old-time haunts of that his - toric portion of the Thames riverside .

		Thus we have chapters on
Mjary Astell	PERSON	,
Don Saltero	PERSON	and his coffee-house , Dr.
Bartholomew	PERSON	Do - meniceti and his baths ,
James Neilds	PERSON	the philanthropist , and his eccentric son ,
John Camden Neilds	PERSON	, and others , with an account of the
Chelsea Porcelain Factory	ORGANIZATION	, and another of the Physic Garden of the
Worshipful Society of Apothecaries	ORGANIZATION	.

		Necessarily the great Sir
Hans Sloane	PERSON	and the Carlyles and
Whistler	LOCATION	and others of high renown play some part in Mr.
Blunt	PERSON	's narrative ; and the famous man - sion bought by
Sloane	PERSON	in
1736	DATE	-LRB- and recently made the subject of an interesting volume by Mr.
Randall Davies	PERSON	`` The
Greatest House	ORGANIZATION	at
Chelsea	LOCATION	'' -RRB- has its history briefly outlined in one of the chapters .

		Light is thrown on the character and accomplishments of Sloane by extracts from the little-known `` Narrative of Some of the Occurrences in the Life of Ed - mund
Howard	PERSON	of the
Parish of Chelsea	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Howard was in the famous naturalist 's em - ployment as servant , and seems to have been a shrewdly observant person .

		But the best of the book is reserved till the last , when the author reproduces four unpublished letters from Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	to her maid
Jessie	PERSON	-LRB- now Mrs.
Broadfoot	PERSON	of
Thornhill	PERSON	-RRB- and adds details furnished him by Mrs.
Broadfoot	PERSON	herself all illustrating the amiability of maid
Jessie	PERSON	's master and mistress , and correcting certain widely prevalent misconceptions .

		Mr.
Blunt	PERSON	's father , it appears , was rector of
Chelsea	LOCATION	at the time of Mjrs .

		Carlyle 's sudden death , and thus the author is enabled to correct
Froude	PERSON	's characteristically inaccurate account of that period in the life of the
Carlyles	LOCATION	.

		Note - worthy illustrations from scarce old photo - graphs and engravings contribute to the interest of the book .

		The field of Egyptian archae - ology has just been resurveyed archeology .

		j n a gi ^ English edition of Sir
Gaston Maspero	PERSON	's `` Manual '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , ed - ited by Mrs.
C. H. W. Johns	PERSON	.

		As M. Mas - pero 's other activities kept him fully occupied , the new editor , who is the sister of the able English Egyptologist F. LI .


Griffith	PERSON	, must be credited with whatever changes appear .

		Mrs.
Johns	PERSON	has transferred to their proper places in the author 's scheme the data which in the fifth edition -LRB-
1902	DATE	-RRB- were lumped in a `` sup - plementary chapter . ''

		She has also incor - porated the most important discoveries which have taken place since that time .

		Among these may be mentioned the structure of the pyra - mid complex , with its four parts : valley temple , ascending causeway , mortuary temple on the plateau , and pyramid proper behind all , as revealed in the excavations at Abusir and
Gizeh	ORGANIZATION	.

		Further work at
Der el-Bahri	ORGANIZATION	on the western edge of ancient
Thebes	LOCATION	has shown that
Queen Hatshepsut	PERSON	's mortuary temple , like that which in earlier days stood at the east side of the royal pyramid -LRB- to which
Hatshep	PERSON	- sut 's cliff tomb excavated in the desolate val - ley behind is in this age analogous -RRB- , was connected by a causeway with a gateway tem - ple down in the river valley .

		The terraced form of
Hatshepsut	PERSON	's cliff temple , which she had received credit for originating , has also been found to be modelled on an
Eleventh Dy	ORGANIZATION	- nasty temple * lying immediately south of it and built before
2000	DATE	B. c. , over five hundred years earlier .

		The `` short table of the prin - cipal epochs of Egyptian history '' included for the first time is a convenient addition .

		The `` Manual , '' however , does not in the text always distinguish different stages of devel - opment , as , for example , in the description of `` moving statues '' -LRB- p. 127 -RRB- .

		The intrusion of priestcraft into politics there indicated did not reach its height until the end of the ``
New Kingdom	LOCATION	. ' '

		The history of the pyramid form continues to be suggested , but not sharply brought out .

		A few well-chosen half-tone plates supplement the cuts -LRB- many of them badly worn -RRB- , which the publishers have re - tained from earlier editions .


M. Maspero	PERSON	's `` Manual of Egyptian Archasology ' ' in its re - vised and improved form , though neither abso - lutely accurate nor thoroughly systematic , is by its compactness and readability well suited to the prominent place which this work has so long held .

		Few Americans have been made New e Engiand the subject of more books and statesman .

		essays , sketches and speeches , than
New Hampshire	LOCATION	's most illustrious son ,
Daniel Webster	PERSON	.

		To the dozen or more exist - ing biographies of this great statesman , jurist , and orator , a by no means negligible addition is now made in Professor
Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	's ``
Daniel Webster	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , in the series of `` American Crisis Biographies . ' ''

		As the author says in his preface , `` the sub - ject is old , and yet ever fresh .

		The shelves of our libraries groan under the masses of books relating to it .

		Yet neglected or largely unused materials are still being brought to * For the very latest news of this temple see the

		24 THE DIAL , Tilly 1 light ; and so intricately do the life and work of the man enter into the very texture of the nation 's history that they are very nearly as incapable of full and final interpretation as is that history itself . ''

		The recent pub - lication of Professor Van
Tyne	PERSON	's `` Letters of
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, '' and of the eighteen-volume `` National Edition '' of his `` Writings and Speeches , '' has made readily available the most important of the original sources to which a biographer of Webster naturally turns ; and these sources have been studiously consulted by Professor
Ogg	PERSON	.

		Inevitably and rightly , it is the public activities rather than the private life and character of the man that receive chief attention in this `` American Crisis '' biography .

		For the more intimately human side of his nature we already have Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's `` True
Daniel Webster	PERSON	'' and the earlier `` Private Life '' by
Lanman	PERSON	.

		Though modestly calling his book a `` sketch , '' Dr.
Ogg	PERSON	has filled four hundred closely printed pages with his careful study of his subject ; and that , too , without over-weighting the volume with extracts from
Webster	PERSON	's writings and speeches .

		What references and quotations do occur seem aptly illustrative and to the point .

		Some disapproval , no doubt , will be his por - tion for not condemning more unsparingly the act that inspired
Whittier	LOCATION	's `` Ichabod '' and made
Horace Mann	PERSON	call
Webster	PERSON	`` a fallen star . ''

		That , however , is a dead issue to the present generation .

		A useful chronological survey of
Webster	PERSON	's life precedes the main narrative , and a four-page bibliography fol - lows it , after which comes the index .

		No life of
Webster	PERSON	the statesman could , in the same compass , well prove more satisfactory .

		Until less than a century ago The social , j j i _ position of deal mutes were regarded much as the insane , or at least the feeble-minded , are now regarded , and the pos - sibility of their being educated to fill positions of usefulness and honor on the same footing as their less unfortunate fellow citizens had dawned upon the minds of but few .

		Their present position in an enlightened country like our own , with especial consideration of the educational problem they present and the provision made for their schooling in this country , is treated with evident thoughtful - ness , and after a careful study of the whole subject , by Mr.
Harry Best	PERSON	in a volume of the
Crowell Library of Economics	ORGANIZATION	entitled ' ' The Deaf : Their Position in Society and the Provision for Their Education in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Of the two headings under which the theme is treated , as indicated in the sub - title , it is to the second that by far the greater space is allotted and rightly enough , for the position of the deaf among their fellow beings ought not to be considered so anoma - lous as to require extended discussion .

		But in this first and less important section of the book it is interesting to note that the pro- portion of deaf and dumb to the whole population of the country has considerably decreased in the last thirty years , according to census figures , though this proportion is almost exactly the same as in
1830	DATE	, the first year cited in the table .

		Our deaf and dumb now number about forty-four thousand , or about four hundred and seventy-six to the million inhabitants .

		It is also noteworthy that heredity has been found to play a less important part in deafness than is commonly supposed .

		If both parents are congenitally deaf , with deafness prevalent in their fami - lies , there is danger of deafness in the off -
spring	DATE	; but `` adventitious '' deafness seems not likely to be transmitted .

		In the section of the book devoted to the history of the edu - cation of the deaf and dumb , and to an ac - count of what is now done for their training by the nation and the separate states , there is evidence of the greatest care and thorough - ness , the references to authoritative sources of information being innumerable .

		As a study of his subject so far as our country is concerned , Mr.
Best	PERSON	's treatise is the full - est yet published ; and what is more , its tone throughout its refusal to consider the deaf as objects of charity is sane and wholesome , and promotive of self-respect and self-help in the handicapped but not disabled sufferers from the lack of one of the five senses .

		The pioneer county library .

		On the first day of the present , - , - , .

		.

		* - , , century there was dedicated at y an Wert > Q h j o > the firgt coun ty library , in the fullest sense of the term , almost a decade before the now famous
California	LOCATION	system of county libraries came into being , and well in advance of similar movements in other
States	LOCATION	.

		The
Van Wert	LOCATION	institution owed its origin to the munificence and foresight of
John Sanford Brumback	PERSON	, banker , financier , and , in earlier years , successful merchant , of that city .

		From the pen of his daughter , Mrs.
Saida Brumback Antrim	PERSON	, who has from the beginning served as secretary of the library board , and from that of her husband ,
Ernest Irving Antrim	PERSON	, Ph.D. , there now appears a handsome volume , `` The County Library , '' narrating the history of the
Van Wert	LOCATION	library and describing its county-wide activities , and also presenting a careful summary of the county library movement in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The life of Mr.
Brumback	PERSON	is briefly reviewed in the opening chapter , and , in addition to Mrs.
Antrim	PERSON	's preface , a commendatory in -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 25 troduction is furnished by Dr.
P. P. Claxton	PERSON	, national
Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		A map , forty-two illustrations from photographs , a full and accurate index , and various statis - tical tables , complete the book 's ample equip - ment .

		Especially worthy of note are the care with which the every-day working of the
Brumback Library	ORGANIZATION	in all its departments and branches is made clear to the reader ; the indubitability of the proof that this is chrono - logically the first free public library actively operating throughout an entire county ; and the diligent research shown in the concluding section , on the county library movement as a whole .

		The county library is gaining rap - idly in favor and importance , and the end is by no means yet in sight .

		This book will aid and hasten the development of the movement , and is sure to prove a useful manual as well as an interesting account of what has been done and is being done in county library work in a representative district of our middle West .

		A commendable contribution to ba'ekwlrd child .

		* & important practical topic is
Barbara Spofford Morgan	PERSON	's `` The Backward Child '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Despite serious limitations of plan and execution , it presents the virtue of an original attempt to see into and through the problem , and to bring to bear upon it the available principles of psychology supported by sound common sense .

		The varieties of tests to be used in securing a diagnosis of the type and range of defect which ordinary yet difficult school children present are set forth in simple lan - guage , and in a form that facilitates appli - cation .

		The art of treatment and relief is likewise considered .

		The book is certain to be helpful to the large number of teachers who have to deal with all sorts and conditions of children ; particularly to those with limited opportunities to determine the nature of the deviations thus presented to the normal stand - ards to which educational measures are ad - justed .

		Yet both the psychology and the pedagogy of the volume are casual ; and many of the analyses are given with an assurance that finds slight support in sound principle ; nor are the available findings of psychology adequately utilized .

		For all this there is good excuse in the newness of the subject and the lack of accredited procedures .

		It is a pity that study showing a rather unusual power to approach a subject without the hack - neyed and irrelevant preconceptions that makes so much of pedagogy futile , should not have been raised to a still greater value by a deeper insight into the rationale of the proc - esses to be practically applied .

		None the less the book may be recommended as adapted to many of the situations that actually confront the correction of backwardness with which the teacher must deal .

		Measured by the stand - ards of recent contributions , the volume de - serves a prominent place in the teacher 's library .

		Disraeli on Whigs and Whiggism .

		In his compilation entitled `` Whigs and Whiggism '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , Mr.
William Hutcheon	PERSON	has put together such of Disraeli 's political writings as deal particularly with what Dis - raeli regarded as Whig ideas and to which he developed an early aversion .

		The volume is composed chiefly of contributions to the `` Times , '' the `` Morning Post , '' and the `` Press , '' and some of these are reprinted now for the first time .

		The general reader will not be intensely interested in
Disraeli	LOCATION	's vindictive attacks on his aristocratic enemies ; but to the student of English history the volume will prove very useful , as it will enable him to understand how the Jewish radical came to be identified with the Tory party and even became the recognized chief to whom the con - servative classes entrusted the defence of the `` land '' and the `` church . ''

		It will also help us to measure the distance that journalism has travelled along the road toward decency in political discussion : language such as Dis - raeli used in his tirade in the `` Morning Post '' in
1835	DATE	-LRB- `` Peers and People '' -RRB- would no longer be tolerated even in the most partisan of party organs .

		The editor has contributed a brief introductory chapter in which he traces
Disraeli	PERSON	's career as a contributor to the political discussions of the day , and ac - counts for his alliance with Lord
Lyndhurst	LOCATION	and other Tory leaders .

		The volume also con - tains several interesting illustrations , includ - ing three facsimile letters .

		There is nothing remarkable aoout the random memories which Miss
Joan Arden	PERSON	weaves together in her account of `` A Childhood '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Scattered impressions that stand out with a weird vividness possessed by nothing grown-up , magical in their sug - gestive incompleteness , mysterious because half-understood , often terrifying , often un - consciously cruel , of such things , in retro - spect , is every childhood made .

		But it is another matter to record these memories with - out brushing off the bloom that makes them alive and lovely and wonderful .

		Perhaps only a shy , self-conscious little girl could grow up to do it : a child whose world is largely in her imagination , and whose experiences are more poignant because so seldom shared .

National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	and the
Wallace Collection	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, and one de - scribing the treasures of the

		Only the best pictures of the old masters are considered ; and the art of the canvas is dwelt upon rather than its origin , name , pedigree , or commercial value .

		No space is given to mediocre or ruined examples by even celebrated painters , the text dealing en - tirely with merits that now exist and may be seen by any intelligent observer .

		Instead of repeating oft-told tales of things past and belonging to a vanished age , the discussion of each picture is con - fined to decorative form , color , handling , method , manner , style , things seen and vital to-day and forever .

		The recent visit to
Chicago	LOCATION	of a company of
New York	LOCATION	city officials , headed by Mayor
Mitchell	PERSON	, for the purpose of inspecting the school systems of this vicinity , was an event whose significance needs to be emphasized .

		We have often asserted that the mayor of a large American city has no greater responsi - bility than that which is associated with the management of its public schools , and that the most important function he exercises is that of appointing the school trustees .

		How that responsibility has been evaded , and how that function has been subordinated to polit - ical interests by the mayors of
Chicago	LOCATION	as far back as memory reaches provides material for a melancholy chapter in our civic annals .

		It would be difficult to imagine a mayor of Chi - cago taking the matter of public education as seriously as the
New York	LOCATION	executive seems to have taken it , although our present executive head , in one of his earlier terms , once went so far as to appoint a really competent com - mission to investigate the subject .

		It is true that the findings of that commission were almost completely ignored , but the fact of its creation was encouraging .

		It remains , never - theless , about the only thing ever done by a mayor of
Chicago	LOCATION	to indicate a sense that the duties of the executive office in relation to the schools extend to something beyond rewarding political supporters , seeing that nationalities and religions and topographical areas are rep - resented in school affairs , and determining the award of fat contracts to the deserving .

		It is not , however , our present purpose to enlarge upon the history of school manage - ment in
Chicago	LOCATION	, but rather to suggest a point of view which is material to the judg - ment to be passed upon the recent outburst of educational activity on the part of ` the
New York	LOCATION	authorities .

		Our approval of the in - vestigation is considerably lessened when we remember that Mayor
Mitchell	PERSON	is the one re - sponsible for the continuance in office of Mr.
Thomas W. Churchill	PERSON	as President of the
New York Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		During his previous term , Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's activities had proved so mischievous and so demoralizing to the interests of the
New York	LOCATION	schools that THE DIAL , -LSB-
July 16	DATE	protests against his reappointment came from practically all educators who observed the sit - uation at close range and were competent to pass upon it .

		These protests were so pro- nounced and so weighty that only a politician could have ignored them , but Mr.
Mitchell	PERSON	flouted the consensus of intelligent profes - sional opinion upon the subject by extending the term of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's authority .

		Many illustrations of his unfitness for the office might be adduced , but numbers could not make the argument more convincing than the single instance we are about to give .

		It is well known that for many years the superintendency of the
New York	LOCATION	city schools has been in the very competent hands of Dr.
William H. Maxwell	PERSON	, one of the most highly respected of American educators .

		Some - time
last fall	DATE	, the
Public Education Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion of
New York	LOCATION	, a voluntary organization of men and women working in the interest of the schools , invited Dr.
Maxwell	PERSON	to attend a conference on the educational budget for the year .

		President
Churchill	PERSON	, learning of this invitation , wrapped himself in the robes of his little brief authority , and wrote to the veteran educator and
New York Superinten	LOCATION	- dent of fifteen years ' standing a letter con - taining the following amazing sentence : `` You are therefore requested not to attend this conference , and to direct the superinten - dents or other officers immediately under your direction that no attention should be paid to the request to appear at such conference unless the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, or its Presi - dent , grants permission . ''

		Dr.
Maxwell	PERSON	's reply to this ukase was dignified but uncom - promising .

		We quote the significant passages . ''

		In reply I beg leave to say that I have received and have accepted an invitation to be present at this conference .

		In this case I feel justified in reaching a decision not in accord with your views .

		I have ever regarded it as part , indeed a large part , of my duty as a public officer , to give infor - mation regarding the schools and their work to any citizen or any body of citizens who asked for it , to defend publicly their work , their administra - tion , and my own actions against unjust attack , and to profit by just criticism and opportune sug - gestion .

		It is in pursuance of this policy that I have in the past attended public meetings to con - sider educational questions , that I have accepted the invitation of the
Public Education Association	ORGANIZATION	for
September 22	DATE	, and that I purpose to continue to attend such meetings . ''

		You request further that I ' direct the super - intendents or other officers immediately under your -LRB- my -RRB- direction that no attention should be paid to the request to appear at such conference . '

		I regret exceedingly that I can not comply with this request .

		I do not find , either in the law or in the by-laws of the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	, that any authority has been conferred on the
City Superin	LOCATION	- tendent of Schools to ' direct ' his colleagues as to their attendance on outside meetings .

		Even if such authority had been conferred on the
City Superin	LOCATION	- tendent , it would be inconsistent with my ideas of the courtesy that ought to prevail among ladies and gentlemen , to ' direct ' my colleagues to pay ' no attention ' to an invitation from any reputable body of citizens to participate in a conference .

		I conceive it to be the duty of all teachers to set to the youth of our city an example of appropriate courtesy in the ordinary intercourse of life .

		Such courtesy is due to all men and women of whatever estate .

		It certainly should not be lacking toward the
Public Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, composed , as it is , of men and women who have taken a deep interest in our public schools , and who have done so much to aid every worthy effort for their advancement and to defeat every attempt at their injury . ''

		But there is a still stronger reason why the City Superintendent should not ' direct ' officers ` immediately under his direction ' not to attend conferences .

		When a man becomes an officer in the public education service , he loses none of the rights of an American citizen .

		Free speech is one of those rights .

		I have too keen a sense of the limitations of my official authority , and too pro- found a regard for the institutions of my country , to attempt to interfere with the right of free speech , even at the request of the President of the
Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		We are not surprised that the magazine `` Edu - cation , '' quoting this letter , calls it `` one of the greatest educational documents of the year , '' and adds that `` its influence will be widespread and permanent . ''

		This correspondence illustrates in a striking fashion a defect which is found in most of our municipal school systems .

		The rights and duties of a superintendent should be so de - fined and protected by law as to make this sort of petty tyranny impossible , and to keep the activities of boards of education within proper bounds .

		Unfortunately , they are not , in most of our states , thus safeguarded , and , in consequence , we find nearly everywhere that fussy and self-important school trustees , whose legitimate business it is to manage the finances of the system and decide broad prin - ciples of educational policy , are interfering and dictating in strictly professional matters with which they have no rightful concern .

		For the educational side of the system , it is their business to employ experts , and then leave them a free hand .

		Any confusion be - tween the functions of trusteeship and admin - istration is bound to be harmful , and ought
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 39 to be made impossible .

		The ideal school board is one whose powers are strictly limited , in whose membership there is no representation of special groups or interests , and whose num - bers are not too large to permit of all being seated around a small table and carrying on their discussions in a conversational tone .

		It is the indulgence in oratory that plays the mischief in board meetings , and makes real deliberation impossible .

		President
Eliot	PERSON	has been urging this ideal upon us for many years , and it is time that we should heed his sane and sober counsel .

		Returning to Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	, it is obvious that any further exhibition of his unfitness to hold the position he occupies must be of the nature of an anti-climax , but there are one or two other matters of which we are impelled to say a word .

		It was only the other day that he distinguished himself by a violent on - slaught upon that worthiest of educational philanthropies , the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, upon the ground , forsooth , that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	does not choose to extend his benefaction to institutions that flout the very idea of a uni - versity by establishing sectarian tests for their teaching .

		The narrow-minded and reaction - ary temper of this outburst is almost in - credible , and is anything but becoming to an educational official in high position .

		Recently , also , Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	delivered himself , at a pub - lic school reunion in
New York	LOCATION	, of an address from which we are constrained to make a few extracts .

		He began by telling the pathetic story of a boy who got into a high school in a slightly irregular way , and who could not be kept there , under the rules , until special action was taken in his case .

		But whence these tears ?

		The action was taken , and surely a system of high schools must have rules reg - ulating conditions of entrance .

		Next , he assails what he calls the `` high school stand - ard , '' indulging in declamation about the schools being `` for the people , '' and inveigh - ing against `` the traditions of ancient aris - tocracy . ''

		This , of course , is the sheerest claptrap , and means , if it means anything , that children of a certain age must be passed through the high school , without regard to their acquirements , and in defiance of the fact that they are not yet qualified to be pro- moted from the lower grades .

		`` Schools for the people '' is a phrase meaning that suitable instruction is freely offered to every child ; it emphatically does not mean that a child has a prescriptive right to be shoved along at the normal rate if through dulness or laziness he does not make the normal progress .

		Later , the author pays his respects to science , which in the schools has `` been enacted into a list of sesquipedalian words and sentences as intel - ligible to the mind of an ordinary parent as the chatter of the jabberwock . ''

		Finally , in - voking the memories of
1776	DATE	, the author in - dulges in a diatribe against what he calls the `` monarchial regiment '' -LSB- sic -RSB- in education , although it is hard to find out what he means by it .

		The trail of the demagogue is over every paragraph of this address , which no intelligent person can read without disgust , mingled with sorrow that its author should hold by the grace of politics the post of high - est authority in the school system of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The `` Journal of Education , '' which prints the address , calls Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	' ' a live wire . ' '

		The metaphor is well chosen , because a live wire may be a very dangerous thing .

		Un - fortunately , this particular wire is at loose ends , and is a menace to those who get within its reach .

		A live wire that is properly and safely circuited supplies the effective driving force that a school system needs , but the cur - rent should be promptly shut off from such a live wire as the President of the
New York Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		JOURNALISTIC IDEALS commonly mean low and utilitarian or commercial ideals , and among the popular metropolitan journals that are usually regarded as not disinclined to sacrifice higher aims to less exalted motives has long been numbered the newspaper di - rected so brilliantly and for so many years by the commanding genius whose name is associated with our leading school for the training of journalists .

		Interesting , and not devoid of unintentional humor , are the fol - lowing extracts from an eloquent monologue uttered by Mr.
Joseph Pulitzer	PERSON	a short time before his death , and reproduced by one of his secretaries in the book elsewhere reviewed in these pages .

		After asserting that `` accu - racy is to a newspaper what virtue is to a woman , '' and that his daily instructions to his staff insist first and foremost upon accu - racy , Mr.
Pulitzer	PERSON	continues : '' I do not say that The World is the only paper which takes extraordinary pains to be accurate ; on the contrary , I think that almost every paper in -LSB-
July 16	DATE	America tries to be accurate .

		I will go fur - ther than that .

		There is not a paper of any importance published in French , German or English , whether it is printed in
Europe	LOCATION	or in
America	LOCATION	, which I have not studied for weeks or months , and some of them I have read steadily for a quarter of a century ; and I tell you this ,
Mr. Ireland	LOCATION	, after years of expe - rience , after having comparisons made by the hundred , from time to time , of different versions of the same event , that the press of
America	LOCATION	as a whole has a higher standard of accuracy than the European press as a whole . ''

		The speaker 's deliberate opinion is that `` there are no newspapers in
America	LOCATION	which are so habitually , so criminally stuffed with fake news as the worst of the European papers . ''

		And further : `` As a matter of fact , the criticisms you hear about the Amer - ican press are founded on a dislike for our headlines and for the prominence we give to crime , to corruption in office , and to sen - sational topics generally ; the charge of inac - curacy is just thrown in to make it look worse .

		I do not believe that one person in a thousand who attacks the American press for being inaccurate has ever taken the trou - ble to investigate the facts . ' '

		Even the charge of sensationalism , most shameful of literary crimes , is made to rest on a very frail founda - tion , if not altogether refuted .

		Is all this to be taken as highly encouraging and gratify - ing , or simply as one more illustration of the old maxim , quot homines , tot sententice , and of the equally ancient truth that men easily believe what they wish to believe ?

		THE TRUTH ABOUT THE TOURGUENIEFF - TOL - STOI BREACH is told by
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's son , Count
Ilya Tolstoi	PERSON	, in the current instalment of his reminiscences of his father , in the `` Cen - tury Magazine . ''

		It is made clear that , con - trary to the prevalent notion , there was no literary rivalry or literary jealousy between the two men ; but there was perpetual discord between their temperaments .

		`` Your whole being stretches out hands toward the future , ' ' writes the older to the younger man in
1856	DATE	; ' ' mine is built up in the past .

		For me to fol - low you is impossible .

		For you to follow me is equally out of the question .

		You are too far removed from me , and besides , you stand too firmly on your own legs to become any one 's disciple .

		I can assure you that I never attributed any malice to you , never suspected you of any literary envy .

		I have often thought , if you will excuse the expression , that you were wanting in common sense , but never in goodness .

		You are too penetrating not to know that if either of us has cause to envy the other , it is certainly not you that has cause to envy me . ''

		But
five years later	DATE	there came what
Tolstoi	PERSON	's son calls `` a com - plete breach ' ' between the two friends , though its completeness was not such as to prevent exchange of courtesies and even an extension of hospitality on at least three occasions on the part of the `` crank , '' as his friend re - garded him , who had secluded himself at
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	.

		The case is well sum - marized by Count Ilya thus : `` It seems to me that
Tourguenieff	PERSON	, as an artist , saw nothing in my father beyond his great literary talent , and was unwilling to allow him the right to be anything besides an artist and a writer .

		Any other line of activity on my father 's part offended Tourguenieff , as it were , and he was angry with my father because he did not follow his advice .

		He was much older than my father , he did not hesitate to rank his own talent lower than my father 's , and demanded only one thing of him , that he should devote all the energies of his life to his literary work . ''

		But of course
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	insisted on being something more than a literary artist , and so these two , each of whom protested that he had never had a serious disagreement with any one else , and each of whom earnestly de - sired the other 's friendship , were utterly un - able to `` hit it off '' together .

		THE SUSTAINING POWER OF POETRY , in mo - ments of physical weakness and mental de - pression , has been attested more than once .

		In an eloquent passage of his writings
Rob	PERSON	- ertson of
Brighton	LOCATION	describes the refreshment and reinvigoration that he derived from Shakespeare in times of weariness , and con - trasts this healthful stimulus with the baleful effects of those grosser medicaments resorted to by the slaves of alcohol or opium .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's well-known sonnet , `` To a Friend , '' beginning , `` Who prop , thou ask ` st , in these bad days , my mind ? ''

		gives high praise to Homer , '' clearest-souled of men , '' but higher still to
Sophocles	LOCATION	, `` who saw life steadily and saw it whole . ''

		During his recent recovery from a severe illness Senator Lodge had re - course to the poets of
Greece	LOCATION	and of
England	LOCATION	to build up again the weakened fabric of his inner life .

		He describes in `` Diversions of a Convalescent , '' published in this month 's `` Scribner 's Magazine , '' the solace and satis - faction he found in recalling certain familiar poems and parts of poems , and tells how his thoughts , `` ranging at will through the wide spaces of memory , turned naturally and chiefly to
Milton	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, above all to the latter .

		Passages from ` Paradise Lost , ' from ` Lycidas , ' ' L ` Allegro , ' ` II Penseroso , ' the '
Samson Agonistes	PERSON	, ' and the ' Comus , ' and lines from the sonnets , came unbidden in the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 41 silences of such a time .

		They were only frag - ments , but there was an endless pleasure in trying to recite them , to see how far the con - valescent could go , and there was something infinitely soothing and satisfying in their noble beauty and in the mere perfection of the words and rhythm , ... '' He reiterates that '' it was to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, best known and best beloved , that the convalescent 's mind turned most constantly .

		His words recurred unceasingly as the thoughts , effortless and un - fettered , flitted here and there .

		Passages from the plays , entire sonnets , repeated them - selves to the convalescent , some over and over again , always with a sense of peace and deep content . ''

		One is reminded of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, in the loneliness and feebleness of his last years , solacing himself with reading again the whole of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		LlTERATUEE AS VIEWED BY ITS MAKERS has unquestionably its seamy side , comparable with that of the drama as contemplated from the stage and behind the scenes .

		When we give ourselves up to the sublimities of the ' ' Divine Comedy ' ' we seldom think of its author as the man who , in more than a fig - urative sense , had descended into Hell -LRB- for it was in that character that the people were wont to regard him as they craned their necks to get a peep at him on the street -RRB- , and when we refresh ourselves with the delightful humor and pathos of `` The Vicar of Wake - field '' we forget the four weary years its author waited , in poverty and discouragement , for its publication .


Goldsmith	PERSON	's ready pen and his dexterity as a compiler gave him but little satisfaction .

		`` While you are nibbling about elegant phrases , I am obliged to write half a volume , '' he complained to his friend
Cradock	PERSON	.

		In the letters of
Edward Dowden	PERSON	now given to the world in two selective col - lections occur not a few expressions of dis - taste for the less pleasing part of his daily duties as a writer of books and as a lecturer on literature .

		For example , one of his let - ters closes thus : `` I must end , and turn to may I say an infernal kind of work , writ - ing examination papers which will occupy me for several toilsome days .

		You at least have not to torture English literature into horrid little questions . ''

		And an earlier one has this passage : `` My miscellaneous read - ing for my E. literature book sinks down into a Serbonian bog .

		You can fully appreciate the difficulty of getting at facts from
Bede	ORGANIZATION	, or rather from ` Beowulf and ` CEedmon ' on - wards , where much is uncertain and much obscure . ''

		Still again , referring to the same task , he moans : `` The English literature has nearly crushed me out of existence . ''

		There is something almost
Carlylean	PERSON	in his outcries against the difficulties of his literary task , though the entire removal of those difficulties would probably have left him as wretched as was
Carlyle	PERSON	as soon as he had finished one book and while he was waiting for the impulse to begin another .

		The author , no less than the obscurest of his readers , looks before and after and pines for what is not , and for what by no possibility ever can be .

		WHY THE DESIRED BOOK IS NOT FORTH - COMING is a question that has puzzled and also irritated more public-library users than could easily be counted .

		With that tendency which we all show to base our generalizations on one or two striking instances , the disap - pointed applicant for a recent popular novel exclaims : `` That 's just the way ; I never can get anything I want here , '' and he -LRB- or more often she -RRB- flings out of the library and slams the door in wrathful disgust or would slam it if it were not for its anti-slam attach - ment which cruelly denies one that solace .

		With a scrupulosity not found in every library report , the
John Crerar	PERSON	librarian explains , in his current annual record of things done and things left undone , `` the causes of fail - ures to supply books called for , '' as follows : `` At bindery , 663 ; otherwise unavailable temporarily , mostly burned or stolen and not yet replaced , 49 ; in use by another reader , 1,073 ; withdrawn from general circulation , 39 ; not found on shelves , 548 ; errors of library assistants or records , 140 ; total , 2,512 .

		The total is 1.58 per cent of the total call slips presented .

		Excluding the first four causes as unavoidable , the avoidable failures were 0.43 per cent . ''

		This total of less than one-fiftieth of all the books called for is cred - itably small .

		The corresponding figures in a public library circulating fiction and other light literature would be considerably larger , probably too large to admit of publication with any great pride on the librarian 's part .

		Among the minor problems daily confronting the public librarian , there is none more hope - less of solution than the problem of meeting promptly every demand for a popular book without overloading the library with extra copies that must speedily become so much use - less lumber .

		IMMORTAL CHARACTERS IN FICTION are not created by every novelist .

		Indeed , to the older novel-readers among us it sometimes seems as if no characters were now being created to compare in popularity and lon - gevity with the famous creations of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		At the
Boston Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	it was asserted the other day 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	that no modern romancer had yet arisen whose characters could be compared with those of these older novelists in respect to what may be called their lingering or haunting quality .

		Surely , if any recent writers have given to the world any
Sam Wellers	PERSON	or Dominie Samp - sons or
Becky Sharps	PERSON	, the world is not yet keenly conscious of the gift .

		And yet , among the younger novel-readers there are doubtless not a few who are far more familiar with the characters of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's and Mr.
Locke	PERSON	's and Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's books than with those of any writer so nearly mediaeval as must to them appear the great trio named above .

		Nevertheless , these other and later children of the romancer 's imagination show little disposition to join the company of uni - versally-known fictitious characters , although exception might be made in favor of several that will occur to the reader .

		Mr.
Dooley	PERSON	, though not exactly a personage out of a novel , has a fame that is more than national , as also have those juvenile favorites ,
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	and
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	; and it may be that
Rebecca	PERSON	will not fade from memory with the passing of the buttercups .

		But no one can tell beforehand what names will get into the `` Who 's Who in Fiction '' of half a century hence .

		... HOW TO WIN THE IMMIGRANT , how to help him to feel at home in the new land , and how to open the way to his becoming a useful and loyal citizen , are questions that have deeply interested Mr.
John Foster Carr	PERSON	, as is already known from his widely circulated `` Guide to the
United States	LOCATION	for the Italian Immigrant , '' a manual translated , mutatis mutandis , into many tongues for the benefit of immigrants from many lands .

		A later work from the same hand , entitled `` Immigrant and Li - brary , '' is primarily for the librarian who wishes to increase the usefulness of his library among the alien population of his neighbor - hood .

		This little book , too , has reference especially to the Italian immigrant , and its preliminary pages of general suggestion and advice are followed by classified lists of Italian books likely to meet the needs and desires of working-class Italians .

		As the writer well says , `` we sometimes forget that no natural - ized citizen can ever be a good American unless he has first been a good Italian or Ger - man or Greek unless he has the reverent instinct of loyalty to the land of his birth .

		If he is to be a good American , we must give him some sufficient reason for respecting and loving our land .

		And how better than through the library can this country of ours be made alluring , accepted in love 1 Alluring certainly is the library 's invitation to per - sonal progress and self-betterment , and in its friendly rooms are an American environment and the atmosphere of our spoken English . ''

		Among evidences that library work with those in whom Mr.
Carr	PERSON	is interested is not thrown away may be cited the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's testimony that `` children of foreign-born par - ents read a better class of books than their American brothers and sisters . ''

		The Immi - grant
Education Society	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	, pub - lishes Mr.
Carr	PERSON	's useful manual , which is likely to meet with an increasing demand , if certain signs in the library field are not mis - leading .

		... THE MODESTY OF GENIUS is one of its most pleasing traits when it is present , which it not always is .

		In our mental pictures of Dickens the quality of modest simplicity and utter absence of conceit or self-consciousness is , perhaps , not the most prominent feature , thanks to the stories that have come down to us of his jaunty appearance as a young man , and of preference for neckties of not the quietest hue and for other articles of personal adornment rather characteristic of the dandy .

		That we may have unwittingly done the great novelist a wrong seems to be indicated by a noteworthy passage from the pen of his son , Mr.
Henry Fielding Dickens	PERSON	,
K. C.	PERSON	, who con - tributes `` A Chat About
Charles Dickens	PERSON	'' to this month 's ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		He writes : `` Now if I were asked what it was that had struck me most about my father I think I should unhesitatingly say that it was his extraordinary modesty .

		His nature was of the simplest ; his absence of affectation or conceit surprising .

		When it is remembered how , at the age of twenty-four , he jumped to the very top of his profession and remained there to the end , no man could well have blamed him if he had shown some slight symp - toms of having had his head turned .

		I can emphatically assert , from my knowledge of him , that there was a total absence of any - thing of the kind . ''

		It may be objected that the members of a man 's family are too near him to see him in the right perspective , and the objection is not without weight ; but let us not forget the emphatic words of
Carlyle	LOCATION	upon hearing of
Dickens	PERSON	's death , `` the good , the gentle , high-gifted , ever-friendly , noble
Dickens	PERSON	; every inch of him an honest man . ' '

		THE LITERARY DIVERSIONS OF A PHYSICIAN sometimes succeed in securing a place in his affections not second to that held by the things of his profession .

		It is safe to say that Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	, Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	, Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, and Dr.
S. Weir	PERSON	1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 43
Mitchell	PERSON	all took more satisfaction , in secret if not openly , in their success and fame as authors than in their reputation as prac - titioners of medicine .

		`` What we accomplish with the left hand and at odd moments seems to bear more unmistakably the stamp of innate capacity or genius than that which with sedulous training and strenuous effort we achieve in our regular working hours and by the conscientious application of our best ener - gies .

		Dr.
Christopher Johnston	PERSON	, who died in
Baltimore	LOCATION	at the end of
last month	DATE	, was the son of a physician and was himself educated to be a physician , and for eight years prac - ticed medicine in the city of his birth ; but Oriental studies encroached increasingly on his time and attention , until finally he became known to the world as one of the most emi - nent Orientalists in this country and as a writer in his chosen department of learning , holding at the same time a professorship in this department at
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		He wrote `` Epistolary Literature of the As - syrians and Babylonians , ' ' which appeared in
1896	DATE	, and edited ten years later a work on `` Ancient Empires of the East . ''

		Articles on Assyriology and Egyptology also came from his pen , and he gave assistance to Professor
Paul Haupt	PERSON	in a new translation of the Bible issued some years ago in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Johnston	PERSON	was born in
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
Dec. 8 , 1856	DATE	, received his college education at the
Univer	PERSON	- sity of
Virginia	LOCATION	, his medical training at the
University of Maryland	ORGANIZATION	, studied and after - ward taught Semitics at
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, and rose to the dignity of a full professorship -LRB- in Oriental history and archaeology -RRB- in that uni - versity six years ago .

		THE QUESTION OF PUBLIC PENSIONS FOR AUTHORS , a question that some are trying to agitate in this country , has more than one aspect and is not the simplest problem imag - inable .

		Generally speaking , what interest in or acquaintance with literature can be claimed for our legislators or other government offi - cials who would be called upon to grant the proposed pensions ?

		In
Tennyson	PERSON	's day in
England	LOCATION	, as the
London	LOCATION	`` Chronicle '' has recently pointed out , there was no end of difficulty in getting suitable pensions for de - serving men of letters .

		`` When the question of granting the author of `` The Lady of Shalott '' a pension of two hundred pounds was under consideration , there was a rival in the field in the person of
Sheridan Knowles	PERSON	.

		Peel confessed his complete ignorance of both claimants .

		`` What ! ''

		exclaimed
Monckton Milnes	PERSON	, `` have you never seen the name of
Sheridan Knowles	PERSON	on a playbill ? ''

		`` No . ''

		`` And have you never read a poem of
Tenny	PERSON	- son 's ? ''

		`` No . ''


Milnes	PERSON	sent him ``
Locksley Hall	PERSON	'' and `` Ulysses '' to peruse at his leisure , and the great statesman may or may not have done so ; but , as all the world knows ,
Tenny	PERSON	- son was so fortunate as to get his pension .

		Knowles 's turn came later .

		Apparently it would have been all one to Peel whether the pension was asked for in the name of the greatest poet in the land or for the obscurest rhymester of
Grub Street	ORGANIZATION	.

		ANOTHER BUSINESS MEN 'S BRANCH LIBRARY , after the pattern of the highly successful pioneer institution of this kind at
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, is about to be established in
Boston	LOCATION	's
City Hall	ORGANIZATION	, in the room formerly used by the now extinct board of aldermen .

		The library already has a good collection of such reference books , maps , atlases , and other works , as are needed for the equipment of the proposed branch , and as it is not at present intended to provide books for circulation there will be little expense involved in the installation of the new service .

		Dr.
Edward M. Hartwell	PERSON	, secretary of the statistics department , is named as head of the
City Hall Branch	ORGANIZATION	the name of this latest addition to the
Boston	LOCATION	Public Library system .


New York	LOCATION	has a similar branch of its public library in its
City Hall	LOCATION	, and it is safe to say that the business men 's branch , as an essential part of the American public library , has come to stay and to grow .

		_________________ BY-PRODUCTS OF LITERARY ENDEAVOR .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		There are so many , in these days of
Compulsory Education	ORGANIZATION	, who can write , after a fashion , that it is not surprising to find the poor author adven - turing upon paths unknown to his more stolid forefathers .

		The dignity of letters is only for the writer with a competence ; the others have to scramble for what they can get , like schoolboys in a muddy field .

		And even your successful author , arrived at a pitch where he enjoys a more than comfortable income from his work , too often throws his dignity to the winds , scrambling with the rest for more , which , from the point of view of his less fortunate brother in art , can not be held other than reprehensible .

		But what is a popular writer to do when editors pursue him with flattering proposals ?

		It takes a mind of uncommon loftiness to refuse handsome offers of cash for work that is easy and affords an agree - able change .

		And so we find novelists of renown , both men and women , writing in the public press , no doubt for highly exorbitant fees , on subjects with which they are often very imperfectly acquainted .

		In fact , the less they know about their topic , it would seem , the more anxiously does the modern 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	editor crave their assistance .

		It has lately become the fashion with the more widely circulated of our
London	LOCATION	morning papers to select the most incon - gruous persons to act as reporters on their '' Sports '' page .

		Football , of course , is just now the popular craze , among a certain section of the public .

		We possess a whole class who follow the career of their favorites in the various leagues , or in the Cup Ties , with more than a feverish interest .

		Football , with these , is a religion : they are steeped in the terminology of the game : their reading , conversation , and thoughts appear all to be concentrated upon this one absorbing topic .

		And I suppose that the kindly editor of the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Mail '' imagined that this intelli - gent section of his readers hungered for variety .

		Perhaps he reasoned that , being human , they must surely be getting tired of the uninspired stuff that was served up to them week after week by the common reporters .

		Or perhaps again he is a subtle humorist , delighting in the incongruous for its own sake .

		At any rate , for the last few months he has adopted the practice of employing as football reporter the Ignorant Celebrity .

		Some - times he entraps a lady novelist ; sometimes a pillar of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The one essential appears to be that the writer should know as little as possible of the game he has to describe .

		Whether the football enthusiast enjoys the curious sus - tenance that is dished up to him above these honored names I have no means of telling .

		I should conjecture that he takes his favorite pas - time too seriously to relish the change ; probably he prefers the common man who knows his busi - ness to the more florid balderdash of the accom - plished word-spinner .

		On the other hand , the editor of this popular journal is assuredly a man who knows his public .

		He is aware that they like big names .

		And it is possible that his readers experience a pleasant sense of superiority when they discover that , after all , they know more about the intricacies of
the Association	ORGANIZATION	code than Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	or the Right Reverend the Bishop of
Zanzibar	LOCATION	.

		This pursuit of the
Big Name	ORGANIZATION	is nothing new in British journalism : this latest development is merely a new phase of a practice that came into vogue toward the
end of the last century	DATE	.

		And there is something to be said for it .

		The opinion of the expert is very well , but now and again it is not amiss to have also the opinion of one who has earned his reputation in other fields .

		Thus we get a certain freshness of outlook ; and freshness is an eminently desirable quality in a daily paper .

		A short time ago editors were all for securing the services of well-known players to write of the games in which they excelled .

		Professional crick - eters used to write of the matches in which they took part ; commonly , it may be admitted , they made a very dull job of it .

		So , too , almost all our leading golfers perpetrated books of advice on their so popular pastime .

		Some of these dis - played a literary facility that confounded those critics who held that a certain torpidity of intellect was essential to the making of a first-class golfer .

		But there was , necessarily , a degree of sameness about their work : even the most enthusiastic of golfers began to get tired of reading similar advice , worded with a slight difference .

		And the point of view was always the same , the intensely serious outlook of the man to whom golf was a means of livelihood as well as a game .

		And so with cricket , and football , and the rest .

		It occurred to the powers who rule such things that perhaps the professional writer and preacher might infuse a little more spirit into the affair .

		And so they turned to the professional writer , the professional speaker , the artist in words and phrases , for a change .

		Our great lights in fiction took up the work readily enough .

		But I do not know that they made a great success of the business .

		Several novelists have tried their hands at football matches ; a bishop or two , I believe , have written their impressions of other games in which the Church had , up to that time , taken but a languid interest .

		But any freshness that they might have brought to their task was nipped by a natural fear of displaying their ignorance .

		Indeed , in most cases , the journal that employed them thought it necessary to provide a journalistic nurse to coach them in their duties .

		Under the eye of this mentor the poor fellows were afraid to let their fancy have free play .

		The apologetic note was too much in evidence in their work ; and their reports read very much like those of a new hand who had yet to learn the alphabet of his trade .

		Certainly the bishops contrived to introduce a few words of moral reflection ; the lady novelists attempted a few generali ties ; the humorists did their best to insert an occasional joke .

		But I doubt if the experiment will be repeated when we come to another football season .

		The press of this country , very properly , does all it can to brighten its pages .

		Some years ago , we had the reputation of possessing the most solid daily press in the world .

		The solidity implied weight ; and our morning papers secured their dignity at the cost of hard reading .

		Twenty years ago , or even less , the man who assimilated his '' Times '' in the morning felt as if he had already done a good day 's work .

		As the general pace of life increased , it was felt that this daily labor imposed too great a task upon the nation ; even the '' Times '' -LRB- most conservative of organs -RRB- had to modify its form and cast overboard some of its ancient lumber .

		It was about that time that the personal '' causerie '' began to take the place of the reasoned criticism .

		The art of writing in the press became the art of chatting pleasantly about personal predilections .

		Lightness and freshness of outlook were the two qualities most in demand .

		Young men were captured fresh from the uni - versities , or even earlier , and set to record their impressions of the latest performances in
Litera	LOCATION	- ture , Painting , Music , and the Drama .

		And at first , no doubt , they did infuse a certain amount of freshness into their task .

		But a very little experience of the critic 's arm chair is sufficient to give the tyro all the airs of the expert ; and in a very few weeks the young men were discovered to have picked up most of the outworn tags of their predecessors .

		But the manner , at any rate , was different ; and the manner has persisted .

		The
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAI , 45 reviewer of to-day , with the critic of music and the drama , still commonly adopts the personal standpoint , which is a legacy from those earlier times .

		He does not go back to first principles .

		He has , in short , no standard by which to judge but that of his own sympathies .

		It is something for the young writer that he has no longer to mould his thoughts into the arbitrary form employed by the journalist of former days .

		He has a freer hand , both as to matter and manner .

		The old '' leading article '' of our youth had a framework of cast iron : it was a bed of Pro- crustes into which the writer had somehow to mould his thoughts , sometimes cutting them short but more often expanding them to the last degree of tenuity .

		Those three paragraphs , each about half a column in length , had to be filled ; and the unhappy journalist , in self defence , fell insensibly into the habit of using the longest periphrases , a dozen words where two would serve .

		You could tell the accomplished leader-writer at a glance when he adventured into other fields of literary endeavor : there was apt to be something didactic and long-winded even in his conversation .

		He gained a fatal facility in the use of words ; he became a machine for transforming every con - ceivable subject into articles in three paragraphs .

		I am glad to think that the leading article , in its old form , is practically dead .

		It could not be said to be good practice for the intending Man of Letters .

		I confess myself a believer in the notion of a writer trying as many fields as possible .

		It is a commonplace that the best masters of prose have in general been able to write fluent if not inspired verse .

		And journalism has given many of our greatest names to literature , from the times of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	to the present day .

		The practice of daily writing may or may not be useful ; sometimes , no doubt , it makes for pro- lixity .

		But the journalist has to touch life at many points : he must have at the least a bowing acquaintance with all the activities of the moment ; and this should have its use when he comes to the writing of novels .

		So that Mrs.
Elinor Glyn	PERSON	and her sisters , who have recently paid occasional visits to the football field in the way of business , may possibly find inspiration for future works in the unaccustomed spectacle .

		In the meantime , their names have been advertised among a section of the public to whom , in all probability , their works had up to that time been but indifferently known .

		And so , too , with the stage .

		The masters of modern fiction adventure more and more into this province , and with increasing success .

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	is the most popular playwright of the moment ; Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	may be said to have won his spurs at the same innocent pursuit ; Mr.
Temple Thurston	PERSON	is another recruit who appears to be making his way toward the legiti - mate drama by way of the music-hall sketch .

		Of Sir
James Barrie	PERSON	, and the other lights who have already illuminated the British stage , there is no need to speak now .

		But he , too , has been coquet - ting with the music-halls .

		And while some of our older dramatists have been occupying themselves in the designing of pageants , one novelist , Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	, has struck out a new line for himself by turning out those curious medleys , so popular here of late , which we call Revues .

		And his industry has contributed not a little to the brightness of these strange productions .

		There are rumors of other novelists following his example .

		The more the barriers are broken down in this and other directions the better .

		I do not know that the profession of novelist can be said to be decaying , but it is certainly somewhat incon - veniently over-crowded in these days .


E. H. LACON WATSON	PERSON	.


London	LOCATION	,
July 1 , 1914	DATE	.

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		LAMAE
FONTAINE	PERSON	AND `` ALL QUIET ALONG THE POTOMAC . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The bare statement in a recent book , '' Writers and Writings of
Texas	LOCATION	, '' that
Lamar Fontaine	PERSON	was the author of the poem , `` All Quiet along the Potomac , '' calls to mind one of the most pic - turesque figures in American literature and a lit - erary controversy that was bitterly waged by the press during the seventies and eighties .


Fontaine	PERSON	was born ,
October 10 , 1829	DATE	, in
Laberde Prairie	LOCATION	,
Washington County	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	.

		In
1840	DATE	his family moved to
Austin	LOCATION	, then the capital of the
Republic	LOCATION	, where his father served first as private secretary to President
Lamar	PERSON	-LRB- for whom
Fontaine	PERSON	was named -RRB- , and later as pastor of the Episcopal church .

		The remainder of
Fontaine	ORGANIZATION	's life reads like pure fiction , and is rivalled in interest only by the adventurous life of Captain
John Smith	PERSON	.

		Shortly after his arrival at
Austin	LOCATION	he was cap - tured by the Comanche Indians , who kept him a prisoner for four years .

		Escaping by a clever subterfuge , he returned on foot to
Austin	LOCATION	, a dis - tance of seven hundred and fifty miles .

		After six years in the
U. S. Navy	ORGANIZATION	, under the instruction of Lieutenant
Matthew Fontaine Maury	PERSON	, he went to
Russia	LOCATION	, where he entered the Russian army .

		Dur - ing the siege of
Sebastopol	LOCATION	, by his expert marks - manship , he attracted the attention of the Czar , who bestowed on him the
Iron Cross of Peter the Great	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
Russia Fontaine	ORGANIZATION	journeyed to
South America	LOCATION	, and was there working as a civil engineer when the Civil War broke out .

		He sailed imme - diately for the South and enlisted in the Confed ^ erate army , acting for two years as a scout for
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	and later as a courier for Pem - berton and
Johnston	PERSON	.

		At the siege of
Vicksburg Fontaine	ORGANIZATION	distinguished himself by penetrating the
Union	ORGANIZATION	lines on crutches and entering the city with important dispatches and 40,000 gun caps .

		Alto - gether he took part in twenty-seven battles and fifty-seven skirmishes , and was wounded sixty - seven times !

		After the war and until his death in
Augusta	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, he supported himself by teach - ing and surveying .

		The poem which is responsible for
Fontaine	ORGANIZATION	's literary prominence appeared anonymously in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' for
November 30 , 1861	DATE	, under 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	the title , '' The Picket . ''

		His claim to its author - ship was not long uncontested .

		Mrs.
Ethel Beers	PERSON	, the only other contestant who gained much con - sideration , died on the very day -LRB-
October 10 , 1879	DATE	-RRB- on which her only volume of poetry , `` All Quiet along the
Potomac	LOCATION	, and Other Poems , '' appeared .

		This volume did much to strengthen her claim .

		She has been favored , too , by most authorities .

		Thus
Appleton	PERSON	's '' Cyclopaedia of American Biog - raphy '' remarks : '' Her most noted poem is ` All Quiet along the Potomac / suggested by an oft - repeated dispatch during the first year of the Civil War .

		Its authorship was warmly disputed ; but , as is usual in such cases , only one of the claimants had written other verses of equal merit .

		That was Mrs.
Beers	PERSON	, and there is now no further doubt as to the genuineness of her title . ''

		The poem had appeared under her name without com - ment in
W. C. Bryant	PERSON	's `` Library of Poetry and Song '' in
1871	DATE	.

		Even Southern reference books have usually made cautious statements . ''

		The South in the Building of the Nation , '' to quote an instance , remarks : ''
Fontaine	PERSON	claimed the author - ship of ' All Quiet along the Potomac , ' but his claims seem not to be firmly established '' ; while
C. W. Raines	PERSON	's '' Bibliography of
Texas	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 84 -RRB- declares : `` Mr.
F.	PERSON	, one of the claimants to the authorship of this celebrated poem , was a man of but little literary ability ... and a school - teacher of scant qualifications .

		He has many cer - tificates of respectable men to sustain his claim , but the internal evidence is lacking . ''

		As early as
1869	DATE	, however , when the controversy between Mrs.
Beers	PERSON	and
Fontaine	PERSON	was just begin - ning , the poem was published under
Fontaine	PERSON	's name in '' The Southern Poems of the War '' -LRB- collected and arranged by Miss
Emily V. Mason	PERSON	, of
Virginia	LOCATION	-RRB- and in '' The Southern Amaranth '' -LRB- by Miss
Sallie A. Brock	PERSON	-RRB- , with notes alluding to the controversy and sustaining
Fontaine	ORGANIZATION	's claim .

		In this year , also ,
James Wood Davidson	PERSON	compiled his '' Living Writers of the South , '' in which he credited the poem to
Fontaine	PERSON	, justifying his act by publishing letters from
Fontaine	PERSON	and various other Confederate officers .

		This evidence is strengthened by several other letters in
Sam H. Dixon	PERSON	's `` Poets and Poetry of
Texas	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1885 -RRB- , a quaint old book , long out of circulation .

		The most interesting of these is a letter from
Fontaine	PERSON	, dated
June 24 , 1885	DATE	.

		Fontaine begins by telling of his friendship with a Mr.
Moore	PERSON	, a member of his own company , with whom , '' because we were of the same tempera - ment , and exceedingly fond of poetry , '' he usually contrived to stay , even while on picket duty .

		On
August 2 , 1861	DATE	, he goes on to say , he and
Moore	PERSON	were hailed by a Federal picket , who invited them to come half way to exchange papers .

		Fontaine swam across to the island , `` put on one of the overcoats of the guard , and ate a hearty meal , and made arrangements with the entire post that we would not fire at one another while on guard . ''

		He then returned to the Confederate lines . ''

		We had to stand on post six hours at a time , '' he con - tinues . ''

		That night I took my stand at six and
Moore	PERSON	retired to rest .

		... As soon as I found that
midnight	TIME	had arrived I stepped to the fire and threw on some pine knots , and roused
Moore	PERSON	to take my place .

		He rose slowly and gathered his gun and stepped to the fire , stretching himself , as a sleepy soldier will , and gaped and yawned ; and while his arms were extended , and his hand grasped the barrel of his gun , there was a flash across the river and the whiz of a bullet , and he sank to the earth , with a hole just above his eye on the left side ... Not a word , not a groan escaped him .

		I removed his remains from near the fire where he had fallen .

		As I did so my eyes fell on the telegraphic columns of a newspaper , and it was headed ` All Quiet along the Potomac To-night . '

		And , oh , how truthful it was ... When morning dawned the words of that news - paper were burned in my brain they rang in my ears , and were painted on every scene that met my view ... And while I stood and gazed at his marble face and glazed eyes ... I felt what few mortals ever feel in this shadowy vale .

		I penned the outlines of the poem then and there , but not as they now appear , for the first were biting and sarcastic .

		I read the crude copy to Mr.
W. W. Williams	PERSON	, and to
Graham	PERSON	and Deprist .

Williams	PERSON	suggested that if I would only make it pathetic , instead of sarcastic , it would be better .

		I did so , and on the 9th of
August	DATE	I had it com - plete , as the poem now stands , and I read it to my messmates ... and gave them copies of the orig - inal , and they recopied and sent them home , and soon the whole regiment , brigade , division , and army were in possession of it . ''

		Mrs. Beers claims to have written the poem on a '' cool
September	DATE
morning	TIME	, after reading the stereotyped announcement , ` All Quiet , ' etc. , to which was added in small type , ' A Picket Shot . ' ''

		But it is obvious that
Fontaine	PERSON	's account of why he wrote the poem is the more plausible and could better explain its deep emotion .

		In regard to Mrs.
Beers	PERSON	, he wrote in the letter mentioned above : '' Does it seem possible to a reading public that a woman unacquainted and unused to the scenes and incidents of war should be able to portray so good and so true a picture , and she a thousand miles from the spot ?

		or how a Northern woman could write a poem so truly Southern , when the most intense and bitter animosity existed between the two sections , and a cruel , bloody war was raging at the time ?

		It passes all comprehension .

		And if she could do such a thing , she would be the most remarkable woman on the face of the earth . ''

		Fontaine , it should be remembered , wrote other poems : his war songs are excellent , notably `` Oenone , '' `` Only a Soldier , '' and `` Dying Pris - oner at Camp Chase . ''

		For these he deserves some attention , even if his claim to `` All Quiet along the Potomac '' be not recognized .

		Regardless of who wrote the poem , it is interesting to read
J. W. Davidson	PERSON	's dictum that it will be remembered '' as long as hostile hosts send sorrow over civilized country as long as bloody death in distant lands breaks loving hearts at home '' ; and
Dixon	PERSON	's state - ment : '' This poem stands among the finest lyrics of the English language .

		It made the name of its author familiar to the world .

		Its popularity does not grow less as tune passes .

		GBOCEE-SHOP CBITICISM . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am one of those who would like to make '' excited protests against the very idea of there being such things in criticism as standard weights , standard scales , and competent literary grocers , '' but Mr.
Ford Madox Hueffer	PERSON	offers me a chance to do something better .

		He .

		explains , in the cur - rent issue of '' Poetry and Drama , '' the difference between non-impressionist writing which is what you defend in your article on ''
Grocer-Shop Criti	PERSON	- cism '' and impressionist writing : '' The difference between the description of a grass by the agricultural correspondent of the
Times	ORGANIZATION	news - paper and the description of the same grass by Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	is just the difference the measure of the difference between the egos of the two gentle - men .

		The difference between the description of any given book by a sound English reviewer and the description of the same book by some foreigner attempting Impressionist criticism is again merely a ` matter of the difference in the ego . ''

		Mind , I am not saying that the non-Impressionist productions may not have their values their very great values .

		The Impressionist gives you his own views , expecting you to draw deductions , since pre - sumably you know the sort of chap he is .

		The agri - cultural correspondent of the Times , on the other hand and a jolly good writer he is attempts to give you , not so much his own impressions of a new grass as the factual observations of himself and of as many as possible other sound authorities .

		He will tell you how many blades of the new grass will grow upon an acre , what height they will attain , what will be a reasonable tonnage to expect when green , when sun-dried in the form of hay or as ensilage .

		He will tell you the fattening value of the new fodder in its various forms and the nitrogenous value of the manure dropped by the so-fattened beasts .

		He will provide you , in short , with reading that is quite interesting to the layman , since all facts are interesting to men of good will ; and the agriculturist he will provide with information of real value .

		Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	, on the other hand , will give you nothing but the pleasure of coming in contact with his temperament , and I doubt whether , if you read with the greatest care his descrip - tion of false sea-buckthorn -LRB- MppopJice rhamnoides -RRB- you would very willingly recognize that greenish-gray plant , with the spines and the berries like reddish amber , if you came across it . ''

		Or again so at least I was informed by an editor the other day the business of a sound English reviewer is to make the readers of the paper under - stand exactly what sort of book it is that the reviewer is writing about ... What the sound English re - viewer , therefore , has to do is to identify himself with the point of view of as large a number of readers of the journal for which he may be reviewing , as he can easily do , and then to give them as many facts about the book under consideration as his allotted space will hold .

		To do this he must sacrifice his personality and the greater part of his readability .

		But he will prob - ably very much help his editor , since the great majority of readers do not want to read anything that any reasonable person would want to read : and they do not want to come into contact with the personality of the critic , since they have obviously never been intro - duced to him . ''

		The ideal critic , on the other hand as opposed to the so-exemplary reviewer is a person who can so handle words that from the first three phrases any intelligent person any foreigner , that is to say , and any one of three inhabitants of these islands any intelligent person will know at once the sort of chap he is dealing with .

		Letters of introduction will there - fore be unnecessary , and the intelligent reader will know pretty well what sort of book the fellow is writing about because he will know the sort of fellow the fellow is .

		... '' Does not Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	succeed in demonstrating that the difference between the non-impressionist writer and the impressionist writer is the difference between a carpenter and a Sheraton or a Chip - pendale ?

		Seriously , I recognize the necessity of the criti - cism which makes it a business to list , describe , and '' place '' books : or , as THE DIAL puts it , '' to estimate literature , to pass judgment upon it , to register the facts about it in some sort of objective fashion . ''

		But that sort of criticism interests me as a reader very little .

		It is useful to those who have a use for it .

		The other sort -LRB- the sort that Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	has written in his autobiog - raphy , that
M. Anatole France	PERSON	puts into his novels , even that which Mr.
Hueffer	PERSON	has put into his `` Memories and Impressions '' -RRB- is interesting to those who have an interest for it .

EDWARD DOWDEN	ORGANIZATION	'S MESTD AXtD ART .

		* A pleasing self-delineation of the Irish critic and poet whose first book , ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	, his Mind and Art , ' ' made him widely known as a gifted writer and a discerning interpreter of other men 's writings , is to be found in the two collections of letters issued under the super - vision of his widow and one of his daughters .

		`` Letters of
Edward Dowden	PERSON	and His Corre - spondents '' is prefaced with a brief editorial note signed by Mrs.
Dowden	PERSON	and Miss
Hilda M. Dowden	PERSON	, and with a longer critical and appreciative introduction by Mr.
W. K. Magee	PERSON	-LRB- `` John Eglinton '' -RRB- .

		`` Fragments from Old Letters .


E. D. to E. D.	PERSON	`` W. 1869-1892 '' is edited by Mrs.
Dowden	PERSON	alone , the `` E. D. W. '' referred to on the title page , or , in full , the
Elizabeth Dickinson	PERSON	West who became Dow - den 's second wife in
1895	DATE	, and who is a daugh - ter of the late Dean of
St. Patrick 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Jtwo volumes appeared almost simultaneously , and together constitute one work , the tone of all the letters being predominantly though by no means exclusively literary and critical , often rich in book-learning , and always kindly and , as one instinctively feels , agreeably charac - teristic of the writer .

		This , of course , applies to the letters from
Dowden	PERSON	, which make up all one volume and the greater part of the other .

		There is something rather touching and wholly ingratiating in
Dowden	LOCATION	's lifelong de - sire to give the best expression of himself in poetry of his own rather than , as he was destined to do , in appraising and interpreting the poetry of others .

		In his college days at
Dublin University	ORGANIZATION	he won , among other honors , the vice-chancellor 's prize for both English verse and prose , and the little book of poems he published at the age of thirty-one was so far successful as to go into a second edition .

		But if he did not win immortal fame as a poet , it was the poet in him that helped to make him one of the soundest and most stimulating of critics and one of the most enjoyable of essayists . ''

		As Mr.
Magee	PERSON	says of him in the preface already referred to , '' The poet in
Dowden	PERSON	was the secret of his per - sonal distinction ; it was the secret also of that strange humility of his , for he hardly valued him - self at all on the possession of those faculties for which the world in his case found most use : his aptitude for mere book-learning , for instance , of which he says in his letters , ' Somehow I have * LETTERS OF

		acquired a lot of wholly useless knowledge and ca n't get rid of it . '

		The creative faculty was what he valued ; and his instinct for recognising it , which enabled him to contribute to literature so large a body of most helpful criticism , was derived from the poet in himself . ''

		Continuing his comment , the writer speaks of the artistic detachment , the objectivity , the lack of the personal element and of expres - sions of personal preference in
Dowden	PERSON	's work as a literary critic ; and he likens his method to that of Sainte-Beuve in French criticism , ascribing to him the highest credit for his interpretation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then , in a passage that excellently characterizes the cor - respondence here under review , he adds : '' It is this missing personal element in his writ - ings which the present collection of letters comes to supply ; and the mere fact that so many of his cor - respondents , from his earliest years , preserved his letters , is already a sort of credential of their inter - est and value .

		The writing of letters was at all times with him one of his principal relaxations .

		He seemed always ready for it , and wherever he hap - pened to be in the
Examination Hall of Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, or lying out on the grass , or in the midst of his family he would pull out his fountain-pen , and in that beautiful handwriting welcomed by his correspondents all over the world , would give the piece of advice solicited , find what he could say in praise of some MS. , supply a fact in literary his - tory , or gossip about himself , his literary , profes - sorial , political activities , with the same blending of irony and sympathy with which he looked on at life and the world .

		It was almost his chosen mode of intercourse with his friends , as he admits playfully to the friend to whom he wrote his best letters : ' It is satisfactory to be at writing distance .

		It is only now and then I am friendly to you in bodily presence .

		However , you are aware that under my talk of the weather there is something more real .

		But on paper I can even talk of '' two new points in Hamlet 's soul '' -LRB- much better than the weather -RRB- . '

		The personality which presents itself in these letters is that almost of a saint of culture : a saint , how - ever , not lost to humanity , nor whom celestial diet has spoiled for human nature 's daily food ; for they are a record of a life passed with the great person - alities of literature . ''

		The preface here quoted from is a little con - fusing and self-contradictory in professing to find in
Dowden	ORGANIZATION	's critical work , which in a general way includes all his prose work , `` an entire elimination of his own personality , '' and in asserting at the end that `` his con - tribution to Irish literature was perhaps the greatest he could have made , a personality . ''

		It was in keeping with this very impersonality of his that he could humorously call himself `` a half-breed Irishman '' and one endowed `` with none of the instincts of Irish nation - ality . ' '

		He refused to join in the Irish literary movement that vainly sought his support in
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 49 the early nineties ; his interest was in a larger literary movement , and it is this very breadth of literary sympathy that has given him so wide an influence in the world of letters .

		And now for a few illustrative extracts from the correspondence itself .

		Here is one that combines the intimate and personal with the literary and critical in a delightful manner .

		It is from a letter written in the country to Mr.
Magee	PERSON	; the date ,
August 12 , 1895	DATE	. ''

		If you are , as I suppose , gone away for your holiday , I hope you have better weather than ours .

		It has resulted for me in a stupefying dose of read - ing .

		I am just now finishing a long poem by Mr.
Milton	PERSON	called ' Paradise Lost , ' which I am sure you have heard of , perhaps read .


Mark Pattison	PERSON	deplores
Milton	PERSON	's prostitution in pamphlet writing .

		I confess I sometimes turn from the addresses of the Almighty to his Son , and vice versa , with some satisfaction to the rages and arguments on divorce and king-killing and prelate-harrying ; and I like to see how the poet behaved in the stress of the realities of his day . ''

		Writing in term time from
Dublin	LOCATION	to Ed -
mund Gosse	PERSON	,
Dowden	PERSON	gives a glimpse of him - self in the class-room .

		He is at his epistolary best in such light and humorous passages as this : ''
Last Friday	DATE	I went into my class-room with a delightful new lecture copied out of a certain new volume by
E. G.	PERSON	, which lecture I purposed to deliver with a critical air and an impressive aspect of original investigation , as the lecturer 's own .

		Imagine my disgust when I saw ' Seventeenth Cen - tury Studies ' already in the hands of one of my students .

		I made a vain attempt to turn him out of my class-room for breach of discipline .

		Then I humbled myself and said , ' I will now read some extracts from a charming essay on
Herrick	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, which I am proud to see is already known to members of my class . '

		The young offender felt touched by this , and did not mention the fact that I read nearly the whole essay . ''


Dowden	PERSON	's long friendship with the woman whom , three years after the death of his first wife , he married , and by whom the last years of his life were cheered , is commemorated in the smaller of the two volumes here under notice .

		The letters begin in the
spring of 1869	DATE	, and end in the
autumn of 1892	DATE	.

		The marriage , after which the two `` were never a day apart until
April 3 , 1913	DATE	, '' took place in
December of 1895	DATE	.

		To judge from the letters and parts of letters published , it was chiefly what may be called a literary and intellectual friendship that finally took on a warmer glow and ended in matrimony , and it is because the letters are devoted so largely to the writer 's studies and literary diversions that they are of sufficient general interest to be made public .

		Here is a part of one written in
1874	DATE	, when the writer was nearing the end of his thirty - first year . ''

		I do n't know what my lecture on the ' Humour of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	' will turn out , except that I have no intention of being funny .

		I conjecture before - hand that not only a man 's laughter is significant , but the history of his laughter , and I think if I arrange
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays in chronological order , and ask what
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	laughed at from 26 to 40 , something ought to be discoverable .

		The wit of the early comedies is something very remote from the sublime and pathetic grotesque of
Lear	PERSON	's fool ... As to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's humour , I think there is a tem - porary and a permanent element -LRB- permanent at least as long as we have the sense of humour -RRB- in it .

		I have rarely laughed aloud when reading Shakespeare , but not so much at anything exactly humorous as at something else , probably sympathy with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's delight in inventing anything so much after his own heart .

		I think in heaven we shall have something corresponding to humour , the relative will still remain , and perhaps the highest heroisms we can now conceive will appear then like the efforts of a baby to think or speak or move , and as we smile with a half pleased , half tender , and wholly loving feeling at the upward tendings of a baby , so we shall have a tender , half - amused joy in the striving after right of souls in their childhood , and we shall afford the same recreation to the Greater Spirits who are above ourselves . ''

		The poetic gift of his correspondent quick - ened the interest
Dowden	PERSON	evidently felt in her from the first .

		He gives her useful advice about writing and publishing , and from time to time commends her work in prose and verse .

		Referring to her literary manner , he says , in a passage that no one who plies a pen will fail to enjoy : `` As to what I said of style I mean not that you have applied the manipulative dexterities of a craftsman to your sentences but that you see and feel what ought to be done , and do it ; and one gets the pleasure from such writing that one gets from the swift work of an artist who tells a truth with every touch .

		The manipulative dexterities I am far from despising . ''

		This mention of '' the manipulative dexteri - ties '' recalls what a reviewer in `` The Spec - tator '' said of
Dowden	ORGANIZATION	's style upon the ap - pearance of his `` Transcripts and Studies . ''

		In a criticism of the book the writer was of opinion that ' ' occasionally Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	allows the wealth of decorative language of which he is a master to get the better of him and serve as a substitute for thought ; but this is not often , and for the most part his criticism is as thoughtful as it is happily expressed . ''

		Happily expressed thoughts abound in these collections of letters ; and though all parts are not equally interesting to all read - ers , no reader who feels moved to open the volumes should fail to find much matter suited to his tastes , and none that is utterly devoid of savor .

		Portraits , views , and facsimiles are included .

July 16	DATE	ENGLISH DRAMA OF THE ITTH AND ISTH CENTURIES .

		* With all the attention which colleges have given in the past few years to dramatic studies , it is strange that no serious history of the English drama of the last two cen - turies should have appeared .

		Dr.
Ward	PERSON	's standard work carries the story only to the death of Queen
Anne	PERSON	; Professor
Schelling	PERSON	confines himself to the Elizabethan period .

		Professor
Nettleton	PERSON	's `` English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century '' is in - tended to supply this lack in part ; and a sequel which will deal with the nineteenth century is promised .

		The present study is dedicated to Dr.
Ward	PERSON	, and has had the benefit of his advice and sug - gestions .

		For the sake of completeness and continuity , Professor
Nettleton	PERSON	has wisely included the Restoration , and has given a resume of the scattering dramatic activities of the Puritan period .

		The volume ends with a discussion of
Sheridan	PERSON	.

		Considering the difficulties of the task and the rather narrow limits of space , the book is in many respects excellent .

		It is based on a thorough study of the plays ; it is logically planned and well proportioned ; in statement of fact it is cautious and so far as it has been tested accu - rate .

		Its literary judgments , if a trifle con - ventional , are generally sound .

		The history is carefully integrated , every writer being con - sidered with reference to his predecessors and his followers .

		Thus , for instance , we are made to see how the origin of sentimental comedy may be traced to the sentimentalized tragedy of Otway and Southerne ; or more specifically , how
Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Sheridan	PERSON	took hints for their great comedies from
Wycherley	PERSON	,
Farquhar	PERSON	,
Steele	PERSON	, and
Foote	PERSON	.

		There is a good , though rather scanty , work - ing bibliography , and a fairly satisfactory index .

		The chief faults are sins of omission .

		Pro- fessor
Nettleton	ORGANIZATION	pays astonishingly little at - tention to stage conditions and dramatic technique .

		The differences between the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan theatre and that of the Restoration are stated only briefly ; the evolution of the Restoration stage into the modern stage is entirely ignored .

		The word `` stage '' does not appear in the index ; the word `` theatre '' appears only with reference to
Drury Lane	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the chapters on the
Garrick	PERSON	era especially we feel the need of some account of the rival theatres and companies ; and indeed the value of the whole book would be greatly increased by a brief chronological view of the theatres * ENGLISH DRAMA OF THE RESTORATION AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURY -LRB- 1642-1780 -RRB- .

		and their history .

		In the same way the de - velopment of dramatic technique is almost ignored , except in so far as it is connected with the controversy about the rules .

		We get only a hint of the decisive influence of new stage conditions on technique .

		So simple a matter as the introduction of the curtain , for instance , had an important effect upon the construction of plays .

		The author 's naivete in this whole matter may be sug - gested by a single sentence .

		`` Like Gold - smith , '' he says , ``
Sheridan	PERSON	prefers ` expec - tation ' to ` surprise ' as a dramatic motive . ''

		Yes : and he might have added , like
Sopho	PERSON	- cles , like Shakespeare , and like every other dramatist who knew his business .

		Aside from these capital omissions , the chief weakness of the book is an occasional woodenness or vagueness of style .

		Certain mechanical tricks , such as the constant quali - fication of a sentence by its successor begin - ning with `` yet , '' become distinctly annoying .

		As to vagueness , just what does this mean ?

		`` The Law against Lovers -LRB- 1662 -RRB- blends with the darker tones of Measure for Measure the lively accents of Benedick and Beatrice . ''

		Or what degree of indebtedness is implied in the remark that `` The
Parson	PERSON	's Wedding '' `` drew from Calderon '' ?

		But these are minor de - fects .

		Some day , it is to be hoped , Professor
Nettleton	PERSON	may enlarge his book and give ade - quate treatment to the parts of the subject which he has slighted ; meanwhile we must be grateful to him for a good working text , in - valuable to students of the period .

		His conclusion is no less Socratic and triumphantly common - place .

		There is a higher and a lower in human nature .

		For happiness and civiliza - tion it is necessary that the lower shall be controlled by the higher .

		The instrument of control is education .

		Plato said the same thing , not less eloquently , if more gracefully and convincingly , in the `` Republic '' and elsewhere .

		But he was n't so sure as Mr.
Thorndike	PERSON	that the thing could be done : the American parts company with the Greek in his optimism .

		Mr.
Thorndike	PERSON	's tone , indeed , makes his book completely national .

		If psy - chology can be American , his is American psychology .

		Notwithstanding , he says in his easy , breezy , sometimes staccato manner , many striking and important things , which are not the less worth repeating because they are the immemorial wisdom of the fathers gaberdined in the slang of a latter-day science .

		Instead of a tripartite morally qualified soul , original nature is now conceived as a multiform congeries of func - tions `` a name for the nature of the com - bined germ-cells from which man springs ' ' '' what is common to all men minus all adapta - tions to tools , houses , clothes , furniture , words , beliefs , religions , law , science , the arts , and to whatever in other men 's behavior is due to adapta - tions to it .

		... Consider the intellectual and moral equipment of the monkeys .

		Add to it certain im - portant social instincts , notably those connected with the more refined facial expressions and the approval-disapproval series .

		Increase in intensity and breadth the satisfyingness of mental life for its own sake , widen the repertory of movements to include human facial expressions , finger and thumb play and articulate babble , enrich the fund of indifferent possibilities of secondary connections and give them the tendency to piecemeal action in very fine detail .

		The result will be substantially the original nature of man . ''

		This `` original nature '' Mr.
Thorndike	PERSON	ren - ders concrete and specific by means of a de - scriptive inventory of instincts and capacities .

		Their origin is `` original nature . ''

		Its im - provement depends on the elimination of the worse , not on their reformation .

		Containing within itself a principle of change , `` the cir - cumstances of the life led by modern man metamorphose almost every original tendency into habits which are much unlike it even directly contrary to it . ''

		This is education `` fostering the good elements of original nature and encouraging their fertility , and debarring the worse elements from reproduc - tion or eliminating them outright . ''

		The in - struments of this education are satisfaction and discomfort .

		These are infallible .

		Left to itself , original nature would run amuck . ''

		The original tendencies of man have not been right , are not right , and probably never will be right .

		By them alone few of the best wants in human life would have been felt , and fewer still satisfied .

		Nor would the crude , conflicting perilous wants which original nature so largely represents and serves , have had much more fulfilment .

		Orig - inal nature has achieved what goodness the world knows as a state achieves order , by killing , con - fining and reforming some of its elements .

		It progresses , not by laissez faire , but by changing the environment in which it operates and by renew - edly changing itself in each generation .

		Man is now as civilized , rational , and humane as he is because man in the past has changed things into shapes more satisfying , and changed parts of his own nature into traits more satisfying , to man as a whole .

		Man is thus eternally altering himself to suit himself .

		His nature is not right in his own eyes .

		Only one thing in it , indeed is unreservedly good , the power to make it better .

		This power , the power of leaning or modification in favor of the satisfying , the capacity represented by the law of effect , is the essential principle of reason or right in the world . ''

		Familiar doctrine , age-old wisdom !

		But Mr.
Thorndike	PERSON	does a great service to state it anew , and so freshly , as an offering to just those folk among whom pedantry is most prevalent and vision most needed , the Lapu - tan professors who are making a mess of the youth of the land with their `` science '' of `` education '' and `` pedagogy . ''

		Written ostensibly for these , the book must by virtue of its robustious optimism no less than its sanity and fluency perforce appeal to all cul - tivated readers .

		When a man is able to draw a living picture out of material gath - ered largely from the Rebellion records it is evidence of more than ordinary ability at por - traiture ; and the knowledge that such was the source of much of Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's mate - rial should incline us the more readily to accept the portraits as genuine .

		Verisimili - tude is stamped upon every sketch , regardless of the copious citations of sources .

		They are all sympathetic , yet pitiless .

		In nearly all the men dealt with here the elements were mixed .


Johnston	PERSON	was straight - forward , absolutely honest and upright , cour - ageous beyond question , yet simple and demonstrative , even to the point of kissing his male friends .

		He loved his men and was loved by them .

		His great failing was that while he could see all the mistakes of
Davis	LOCATION	,
Lee	PERSON	,
Jackson	PERSON	, and the rest , he could see none of his own .

		Stuart figures here as a man of laughter .

		Light-hearted and gay and rollick - ing , he was yet a very Puritan in morals , devoted to duty and capable in the perform - ance thereof .

		Withal he was , says
Sedg	PERSON	- wick , - `` the greatest cavalry officer ever foaled in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Longstreet was no less able and brave than
Johnston	PERSON	; but he was hard-headed , even stolid , seeking to impose his own personality upon everybody else .

		With supreme trust in himself , he trusted no one else .

		No more striking contrast is presented by Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	than when he says that Longstreet was always able to give a good reason for not arriving in time , but
Jackson	PERSON	, when at his best , arrived in time in spite of good reasons .

		Blamed by many for the failure at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	,
Long	LOCATION	- street was determined not to bear the blame himself .

		Perhaps the cleverest bit of shifting in this matter Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	has failed to men - tion .

		Years afterwards , when
Lee	PERSON	was dead ,
Longstreet	PERSON	said that
Lee	PERSON	was to blame , that
Lee	PERSON	himself had said so and that
Lee	PERSON	was too honorable a man to tell an untruth .

		After the war Longstreet became a Republican , that is , to the Southerner , a scalawag .

		For this the South never quite forgave him ; but he never wavered , and always manifested charity for those who had none for him .

		Beauregard 's name betrays the Gallic blood .

		His head fairly boiled with ideas , some of them really good .

		Had they been followed , the Confederacy would have won , so thought
Beauregard	LOCATION	.

		Unfortunately this idea became an obsession with him ; it was a malady that attacked some others also .

		But the man had fine traits ; no one who had not could have so won and kept the devotion of his soldiers .

		Benjamin 's patriotism has been a matter of dispute .

		If Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	had contented him - self with saying that `` it is utterly unjust to deny that his patriotism was genuine or that he gave his very best sincerely , ' ' the reviewer would be forced to take issue with him .

		But the author saves himself , at least in part , by qualifying clauses , `` in his way , '' `` as deeply as he could feel , '' etc. .


Danton	PERSON	, the Frenchman , when urged to flee for safety , re - plied that he did not carry his country on the soles of his feet .

		It seems that
Benjamin	PERSON	did carry his country thus .

		Lee ,
Davis	PERSON	,
Stephens	PERSON	, and thousands of others whose courage and devotion Benjamin spoke of with admiration might submit , but he would never be taken alive .

		They might remain to bind up the wounds of the broken-hearted and build again on the ruins of their country , but not so
Ben	PERSON	- jamin , who fled to
England	LOCATION	and forgot all about the South .

		Had a man of foreign birth been the only one who thought more of him - self than of his country , the story would not be so bad .

		But
Pryor	PERSON	, Wise , and others for - sook the country they had helped to plunge into woe and went to dwell in the North .

		Not so the gentle , large-hearted
Stephens	PERSON	and the fiery
Toombs	PERSON	, two men very unlike , yet both extremely devoted .


Toombs	PERSON	did in - deed flee when everyone was seeking personal safety ; but he never forgot his country , and he returned to do her good service .

		In both men we find a curious mixture of aristocracy and democracy .

		When the fight against the railroads and other powerful corporations had barely begun ,
Toombs	PERSON	was in the forefront of the fight and foresaw `` starving millions of our posterity '' robbed and given over to the keeping of these corporations . ' '

		The right to control these railroads belongs to the
State	ORGANIZATION	, to the people , '' said he , `` and as long as I rep - resent the people , I will not relinquish it , so help me God . ''

		At the same time he favored giving over the people to the keeping of judges not subject to popular election or any sort of control .

		But the greatest contradic - tions are found in
Stephens	LOCATION	.

		Frail of body , practically all heart and intellect , he was easily touched by suffering and ever ready to relieve it , so much so as to win a slave 's simple eulogy : ' ' He is kind to folks that nobody else will be kind to .

		Mars
Alex	PERSON	is kinder to dogs than most folks is to folks . ''

		After this one is shocked to think that he would have made human slavery , wherein the many toil for the few , the cornerstone of the new government he was seeking to establish .

		He was a man of intellect , yet that intellect stopped just short of the profound .

		It is easy enough now for the mediocre mind , reading backward , to see that slavery was already doomed in
1860	DATE	.

		Some mediocre minds saw it then .

		That a man of
Stephens	PERSON	's goodness
1914	DATE	THE BIAJL 53 of heart and strength of intellect could not see it is one of the anomalies of the nineteenth century .

		If Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's book should enjoy a wide reading in the South , it will serve a useful purpose there , as clothing with flesh and blood names which the mass of the people now know little about other than that they stand for half deified heroes whom it is more pious to worship than to suspect .

		The Northern man , also , may read of these Americans with profit .

		The last paragraph of the book is a bit of sermonizing well worth quoting : ''
Meade	PERSON	and
Lee	PERSON	,
Hancock	PERSON	and Longstreet ,
Reynolds	PERSON	and
Pickett	PERSON	, even more , the common soldiers , North and South both , were all Ameri - cans , all ours , ours to praise , ours to be proud of , ours to learn from .

		The inheritance of their courage , their sacrifice , their loyalty to high ideals is one of which no country can ever hear too much .

		And if the tradition of these great souls brings with it glory , it brings duty with it also .

		We are not called upon to go out and fight in arms as they did , but tbere is plenty of fighting left .

		The danger to a republic from open war is great .

		The danger from self-indulgence , from pampered living , from the spirit of letting others do things , is even greater .

		I am ready to believe that at a sudden call to duty our automobiling , dancing , money-getting youth would respond as did those of
' 61	DATE	, drop their play , and go out to defend a Cemetery Hill .

		But I wish we could make them remember that even in common , hum - drum , daily life every man has his
Gettysburg	LOCATION	sooner or later .

		Let him fight it and win it , so that his little republic for of sucb is made the great Republic shall be forever triumphant and free . ''

		RECENT FICTION .

		* This is , I am told , the season of `` hammock fiction . ''

		I should have said of dull fiction .

		For it is a curious notion that the least inter - esting fiction should be the sort best able to compete with the temptation to lie in a ham - mock .

		And for that matter the temptation which
summer	DATE	offers nowadays among the novel-reading classes is not the hammock but its opposite .

		One is in danger of playing too many rounds of golf , or of staying too long in the water , or of being blistered -LRB- rather * MARIA .

		than browned -RRB- by the sun , but one must be a very independent person indeed to be in danger of spending too much of one 's time in a hammock .

		The custom of our society does not permit of it .

		Yet `` hammock fiction '' is not designed for independent , custom-smash - ing persons .

		No .

		Hammocks and fiction have no relation to each other .

		Either fiction is so interesting that one reads it anywhere and anyhow , even when people come to call , or it is too dull to keep one from going to sleep in a hammock .

		But this brings me back to the belief that `` light '' fiction is more in - teresting than `` heavy '' fiction , to the Tired Giant theory of the novel , of which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	speaks , and its brother , the Tired Business Man theory of the stage , of which everybody speaks , or , until recently , did ever - lastingly speak .

		As if Mr.
Martin Andersen Nexo	PERSON	's `` Pelle the Conqueror , '' which is heavy fiction about a boy in
Denmark	LOCATION	, were less interesting than Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wig	PERSON	- gins 's `` Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm , '' which is light fiction about a girl in
America	LOCATION	!

		The division of fiction into light and heavy is utterly misleading .

		It would be much more to the point to divide it into sweet and salt .

		That is sweet which is capable of being ap - preciated by girls with their hair down their backs or the boys who count on being fresh - men next
October	DATE	; and , too often , by their fathers and mothers .

		Since a tooth for sweets is hardly more a trait of adolescence than of maturity .

		That is salt which , while it often mightily offends those who like the sweet , is capable of interesting immensely those of a robust fibre .

		Art has something to do with it , of course ; sometimes it plays hob with my so-simple classification , bringing the robust reader to the sweet kind of thing , and vice versa .

		But mostly art is on the side of the salt just as readers are mostly born to read either the sweet or the salt ; and no power of example and no amount of training can change them .

		All hammock fiction is sweet : the problems of conduct presented are never real ; the moral values are never sharply defined ; and the ending is happy .

		But I would not say that all sweet fiction is intellectually dis - reputable .

		The six novels below are chiefly sweet , and yet , for one reason and another , they are to be considered .

		The
Baroness von Hutten	PERSON	will be remem - bered as the writer whose `` Pam '' and `` Pam Decides ' ' so excited the young person of eight or ten years ago .

		Pam was the sort of girl who , when a caller asked for Mrs. So-and-So , calmly replied : `` I 'm sure you mean my mother .

		She 's Miss So-and-So , '' as , indeed , she was .

		The heroine of the present novel is not as wicked as Pam 's mother .

		Maria fell 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	desperately in love with a person of high de - gree who was already married .

		There were extenuating circumstances .

		For one thing the man 's wife did not love him ; she had married him , as he had her , for reasons of state or politics or whatever the reasons are that control the matrimonial adventures of kings and queens .

		Maria was a singer , and alone in the world .

		Her only complaint of life was that her singing , though wonderful , lacked the specific and marvellous `` some - thing '' which singing ought to have .

		Any one who has read novels about women with the capacity to sing understands at once , which saves the
Baroness von Hutten	PERSON	a deal of trouble .

		In the end , though only at the very end ,
Maria	ORGANIZATION	turns back from the railway train by which she has planned to join her lover .

		The sorrow of giving him up does the trick ; henceforth her voice is divine .

		This is , perhaps , an unfair summary of a novel that is undeniably amusing .

		But is it not sweet ?

		Miss
Phyllis Bottome	PERSON	-LRB- if it is Miss -RRB- starts off almost in the salty vein .

		The cure , being at the house of a
Miss Prenderghast	LOCATION	, thought to himself : `` English ladies can have no temptations : That is why they are protes - tants . ''

		But this sort of thing proves to be only a pocket .

		Jean , the musician , is in love with
Gabrielle	PERSON	and
Margot	PERSON	is in love with Jean .

		The result is that Jean , discovering that
Gabrielle	PERSON	is an adventuress with a past , is broken-hearted enough to produce music even if it is broken music and
Margot	PERSON	sings her heart out to the delight of her compa - triots .

		There is ease here , and cleverness , but only in the use of a formula already well - worked .

		The hero of the
Baron von Wolzogen	PERSON	's musical novel , ``
Florian Mayr	PERSON	, '' is a genuine artist and a favorite pupil of Liszt .

		It is said , by persons who ought to know -LRB- as well as by Mr.
James Huneker	PERSON	-RRB- , that the portrait of Liszt is the best one extant .

		But whether or not the drawing is accurate to the life , the figure is a striking one .

		It is astounding to find this German novelist working in so much feeling with so little sentimentalism ; so much respect for the artist with so keen a humor .

		Those writers who make a religion of baiting the bourgeoisie are usually unequal to the task of justifying the artist .

		But von Wolzogen is never shrill ; he is sturdy ; he is , in the slang of the day , `` human . ''

		The hero of `` The Trend '' is hardly human .

		Mr.
Arkwright	PERSON	confesses as much in a fore - word .

		He says of his characters : `` I think that all of them will be fairly intelligible to a thoughtful reader except perhaps Wil -
liam Soulsby	PERSON	, and him I do not myself pretend to understand .

		His sufferings like his devo - tion are of course patent ... but , after all , was he one of us ? ''

		This trick for it is hardly less is not an engaging one .

		The reader will feel like assuring Mr.
Arkwright	PERSON	that it is his business to understand his chief character and to make us understand .

		Other - wise , why write ?

		But Mr.
Arkwright	PERSON	's novel holds up better than his
William Soulsby	PERSON	.

		If we doubt the existence of a street waif with a voice like a horn from heaven , who creates the role in a new opera and dies as he sings the last note , we can not doubt the Tasmanian wife of the rather pedantic old family friend from
Australia	LOCATION	.

		And
Bob	PERSON	, who discovers
William	PERSON	, is decidedly pleasant .

		There is almost as much salt as sugar here , but the writing is too formal for contemporary taste .

		Most readers will find it stilted and some will be utterly put out to find a lecture on style , several pages of it , toward the end .

		Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	's new novel is not of Dartmoor but of
Devon	LOCATION	, and not of the present but of a hundred years ago , when smuggling was almost as lively a trade as privateering .

		The girl whose name serves as a title , Faith Tresilion , is a fine , brave crea - ture who effects a desperate rescue in a small boat while under fire .

		She was not at all , as the sentimental innkeeper , Mr.
Sidebottom	PERSON	, explains , `` what one expects from an unmar - ried girl . ''

		Perhaps Faith owed a good deal to her mother , who was bedridden , but who said of herself : `` owing to my character and the brains in my head and my great power of language I count for twice as much as a lot of other every-day females that have the use of their legs . ''

		Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	is an honest craftsman , if not an inspired one , whose novels are neither salt nor sweet .

		Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	has now for some time been groomed for a place alongside Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, or at least Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	.

		But `` The Duchess of Wrexe '' will hardly put him there , even if it has interested Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	to write about it .

		Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's skill , and his serious conception of his task , which are what rec - ommend him to Mr.
James	PERSON	, are beyond ques - tion .

		But a novel which offers to study a society must stand rather firmly where con - duct is concerned and that whether it is as satirical as
Herr Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	or as pon - tifical as Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Wai	PERSON	- pole 's duchess is too interesting a figure to omit ; the powerful ones of the Victorian manner and tradition have still an interest for us even though we think we have ceased to respect them .

		But Mr.
Walpole	PERSON	's
Rachel	PERSON	, who occupies as much of his interest as , and more of his space than , the duchess , needs more explaining than he has given her .

		It
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 55 is possible that a young woman of parts , having married a stupid man and fallen in love with a man whose dreams are as -LRB- ' pagan ' ' as her own , would learn to love her husband .

		But it is difficult to understand why Mr. ``
Walpole	LOCATION	regards the whole affair with so much complacency .

		He has not seen this thing sharply , either morally or psychologically .

		He has slurred its values .

		He has been sweet when he might have been salt .

		LUCIAN
GARY	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		, Closely connected with the main Love of mankind J versus theme 01 Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	s latest lave of country .

		p j ay > < < The Mob -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , IS the world-old question , whose interest ever endures , What is a man who holds a faith with all his heart to do ?

		The protagonist ,
Stephen More	PERSON	,
Under Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	and member of
Parliament	LOCATION	, is opposed to the war upon which his country is entering .

		Firm in his convictions that little nations have a right to live , that the annexation , which with vic - tory becomes inevitable , is depriving the enemy a wild , lawless race of a freedom that they cherish above all things , and that `` as we are tender of our own land , so we should be of the lands of others , '' he raises his voice in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, in the name of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	and Civilization .

		With clear vision he places a message `` from the great heart of man - kind '' over and above the well-worn slogan , `` my country , right or wrong . ''

		War has broken out even while he speaks , and every - where his lone opposition is declared as folly , a bit of `` moon-summer madness . ''

		All rise against him : his father-in-law , who has done service in the War Department until his hairs are gray ; his three brothers-in-law who are on the field ; his political associates who taunt him that little nations are his hobby and warn him that by his act he foregoes his chance to sit in the Cabinet ; his friends who get entangled in their feelings and the con - ventions and yet , representing general senti - ment , obey the strongest common instinct in the world , love of country ; his dark-eyed little Olive who begs her father to be on their side ;
Katherine	PERSON	, who deserts him because she feels too unheroic to remain his wife after she has implored him to come down to her level ; and , finally , the hooting mob that hounds him to his death .

		Throughout it all he remained firm .

		Greater to him than the divine right of country was the divine right of mankind .

		With the consummate irony of which Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is a master comes the `` after - math '' at the very end : A statue is erected `` To the Memory of
Stephen More	PERSON	, ` Faithful to His Ideal . ' '

		Equally ironical is the sug - gestion which prevails in the whole play , that the mob-spirit dominates each individual , thinking separately , fully as much as it does the gay , unthinking revellers .

		It is a vivid presentation of what happens , and what has happened since history began , when men -LRB- like the element which gives the play its name -RRB- , as one of the characters says , `` just feel some - thing big and religious , and go it blind . ''

		A history of
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Before Vassar Opened '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	-RRB- is an author - itative volume by Doctor
James M. Taylor	PERSON	, who has only recently retired from the presidency of
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	, after a long term of service .

		This contribution to the his - tory of the higher education of women in
America	LOCATION	will appeal to all college women and , also , to that large circle of readers who are thoughtfully considering educational prob - lems .

		The opening chapters sketch very rap - idly the history of the higher institutions open to women in the South and in the
North	LOCATION	during the years before
Vassar	PERSON	was founded .

		Without undue emphasis upon the hardships , Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	pictures vividly enough the pov - erty in things material , and the wealth in aspiration and ideals characteristic of those early days when , as at
Oberlin Collegiate Institute	ORGANIZATION	, `` most of the ladies paid for their -LRB- weekly -RRB- board by their labor ,
75 cents	MONEY	for vegetable diet only ,
87 %	PERCENT	cents with animal food once a day . ' '

		Stirring , indeed , are these records of the ways in which American women struggled for the privileges of a liberal edu - cation .

		The rest of the book is devoted to the history of
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	.


Matthew Vassar	PERSON	, En - glish by birth , was a brewer in
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	who amassed a fortune of
$ 800,000	MONEY	.

		Shrewd , practical , self-educated , deeply religious , he desired that his wealth should serve some high purpose , and through his niece ,
Lydia Booth	PERSON	, head of a seminary in
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	, and through Doctor
Milo P. Jewett	PERSON	, a man of education and of wide experience , who purchased Miss Booth 's school ,
Matthew Vas	PERSON	- sar was led to found a college for women .

		There are many minor details given regard - ing the preliminary stages , and some very unimportant aspects of the many conferences are unnecessarily accentuated , but on the whole , the account of the foundation is ab - sorbing reading .

		Of keenest interest are the passages that set forth the policy and the academic ideals of Dr.
Jewett	PERSON	, the first presi - dent , and of Dr.
Raymond	PERSON	, his successor .

		The narrative pauses with the death of
Matthew Vassar	PERSON	in
1868	DATE	, when the college was well -
56	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	established and already recognized as a potent influence in the educational life of
America	LOCATION	.

		All those who know how high a standard of scholarship has been maintained by
Vassar	ORGANIZATION	will welcome an introduction to the days when those standards were being discussed and defined .

		Four years of With a burning desire to see the adventure in world , and also with plenty of British pluck and tenacity , Mr.
A. Loton Ridger	PERSON	, at the age of twenty-one , took passage on a tramp steamer for
San Francisco	LOCATION	by way of the Straits of
Magellan	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- not `` round the Horn , '' as he at first says -RRB- , and for the next six years , with little inter - ruption , he was extending his knowledge of geography in both hemispheres , until at last he became well qualified for membership in the
Royal Geographical Society	ORGANIZATION	and now ap - pends the initials ,
F. R. G. S.	PERSON	, to his name on the title-page of his book , `` A Wanderer 's Trail '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Both Americas , from
Alaska	LOCATION	to
Patagonia	LOCATION	, eastern and southern
Asia	LOCATION	, and various parts of
Africa	LOCATION	were visited by him ; and his study of native manners and customs was the more thorough from the necessity he was under of working his way at every step .

		Playing a minor part in a
Seattle	LOCATION	theatre , working in a lumber camp and elsewhere in the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, teaching English in a Tokio school , mining in the
Rand	ORGANIZATION	, engaging in journalism in
China	LOCATION	thus and in a hun - dred other ways he contrived to keep himself from destitution and to provide the where - withal for such travelling expenses as were not defrayed by working his way on ship - board in any subordinate position he could secure .

		Admirable are the adaptability and tact and resourcefulness displayed by this Englishman , who wisely determined at the outset not to wear the stamp of his nationality as the most obvious item of his outward appearance .

		He does not hesitate to ridicule and censure those ultra-British qualities that might , in another , have made shipwreck of such an undertaking as he had in hand ; and in commenting on certain educational defects of the average Englishman 's he goes so far as to say , `` We egregious English know more about football than the intricacies of our language . ' '

		An Italian Once more the American In - studentof stitute of Criminal Law and Criminology has made a wise selection of a classic book for its series of translations .

		`` Criminology '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	-RRB- , which Mr.
R. W. Millar	PERSON	has translated , is by
Baron Raffaele Garofalo	PERSON	.

		This distin - guished jurist of
Italy	LOCATION	has long been an in - stigator of thought and his authority fortifies the most essential conclusions of American reformers .

		He dismisses the juristic tradition that punishment is a measured evil corre - sponding to the degree of guilt -LRB- which may be fixed in advance -RRB- , and substitutes the defi - nition that it ought to be a means calculated to effect the cessation of the criminal 's harm - fulness to society .

		The true notion of crime is not legal but sociological , and many offences are contraventions of useful rules of conduct without revealing a character dangerous to the common welfare .

		By real or `` natural '' crime the author means `` those acts which no civilized society can refuse to recognize as criminal and repress by means of punish - ment . ''

		The persons who commit `` natural '' crimes are classified as murderers , violent criminals , criminals deficient in probity , and lascivious criminals ; and for each group the author proposes a suitable method of elimina - tion or repression .

		Among the debatable pro- posals of the book are : capital punishment of all who are convicted of murder ; deportation of certain offenders ; and the abolition of the jury system and of all pardons and amnesties .

		The author has more faith in the prognosis of criminal psychology and less faith in re - formatory education than we have in Amer - ica , and he has no confidence whatever in juries representing the people .

		On this point he seems to think of justice as a royal gift .

		`` That a people is not capable of administer - ing justice is no reason for depriving it of justice .

		Whether deserving it or not , it should have justice imposed upon it ... What is needed to overcome its barbarous customs is not a jury , but judges who do not represent this people . ' '

		This language would make most Americans cling more strongly to the institu - tion of the jury , with all its glaring faults .

		On the whole the work here noticed is one of the most instructive and stimulating contribu - tions to the study of crime and punishment , quite indispensable to the student of the subject .

		The `` Fifty-eight Paintings by artin .

		Homer Martin '' described by
Dana H. Carroll	PERSON	-LRB-
F. F. Sher	PERSON	- man -RRB- is a necessary complement to Mr.
Mather	PERSON	's recent monograph on the painter .

		Like the books on Inness published in the same form and by the same publisher , these two books differ in plan and scope .

		Mr.
Mather	PERSON	gives a study of the painter 's life and art , illustrated by a few of his most characteristic pictures .

		Mr.
Carroll	PERSON	on the other hand gives us independent descriptions of a great num - ber of the artist 's paintings , not including those in the other volume .

		He offers , there -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 fore , a great opportunity to the student , for only a few of
Homer Martin	ORGANIZATION	's pictures are to be seen in the great galleries , a few are accessible in clubs , while by far the greater number are in private collections .

		So the volume gives something which can not other - wise be attained without great difficulty if at all .

		.

		Where a book offers so much of value it is not ungracious to find minor fault .

		We do not gain from the editor any comprehensive idea of the paintings of which he writes .

		He has chosen to present them in an order of which we do not grasp the significance , neither chronological so as to give an idea of the artist 's development , nor according to sub - ject .

		Of course in such a collection the pic - tures themselves offer us much , however ordered and arranged .

		The lover of painting will want to appreciate the work of the painter for himself , and doubtless many will be helped by Mr.
Carroll	PERSON	's descriptions .

		Homer
Martin	PERSON	was so distinguished an artist and so little really known save to a few that we rejoice at this opportunity to know him better .

		No one else has felt the romance of .

		American landscape just as he did .

		He was not less impressed by its grandeur than was
Cole	PERSON	and he rendered it not less truly than
Durand	PERSON	.

		But the grandeur that he saw was truer than that of
Cole	PERSON	, and his truth was on a larger scale than the fidelity of
Durand	LOCATION	.

		Others had much the same gifts , or greater than those early masters , Church for instance or
Bierstadt	PERSON	.

		But no other painter has seen nature as did
Homer Martin	PERSON	, or if he did , he did not so render her .

		The coir and The African impressions of a atmosphere of poet and dreamer and seer of
North Africa	LOCATION	.

		vj s i ons QJ.Q recorded with wealth of imagery and graces of rhetoric in Profes - sor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	's ''
North Africa	LOCATION	and the Desert '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Its sub-title , '' Scenes and Moods , '' well indicates the book 's char - acter , which is not unlike that of Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	's word-paintings of
Mediterranean	LOCATION	lands , a kind of artistry that , of course , owes far more of its charm and magic to the par - ticular way in which things are seen than to the things themselves if indeed there be any such entity as `` things in themselves . ''

		The successive chapters treat of experiences and observations and reflections in
Tunis	LOCATION	,
Tlemcen	LOCATION	,
Figuig	LOCATION	,
Tougourt	LOCATION	,
Djerba	LOCATION	, and
Tripoli	LOCATION	; of `` scenes and visions '' in the Sa - hara
Desert	LOCATION	; and of meditations indulged in , over pipe and coffee , ' ' on the mat , '' in a small oasis village of the Zibans .

		In his opening pages the author thus takes the reader into his confidence : ``
Tunis	LOCATION	is the gateway by which I entered this world the new world of
France	LOCATION	, the old world of the desert .

		It was almost an accident of travel that I had come here , refuging myself from the life I had known , and seeking a place to forget and to repose , away from men .

		I had no thought of even temporary residence or exploration ; but each day my interest deepened , my curi - osity was enlivened , my sympathies warmed , and slowly I was aware that the land held me in its spell a land of fantastic scenery , of a mysterious people , of a barbaric history and mise en scene , a land of the primitive .

		I coursed it from end to end . ''

		Toward the close of the volume the spirit of the African desert is thus presented : `` In that nomad world , where everything is passing away , there is nothing fixed but the will of
Allah	LOCATION	.

		It is not strange to find fatality the last word of Islam .

		In the desert world the will of nature appears with extreme nakedness ; the fortune of man is brief , scant , and unstable ; the struggle is against infinite odds , a meagre subsistence is gained , if at all ; and the blow of adversity is sudden and decisive .

		Patience everywhere is the virtue of the poor , resigna - tion the best philosophy of the unfortunate , and defeat , as well as victory , and perhaps more often , brings peace .

		These are great words of Islam , and nowhere have they sunk deeper into life than in the desert-soul . ' '

		The book is , obviously , one to ponder rather than to gallop through , to read in certain moods , to drop , and to begin again , as impulse prompts ; and its wisdom of the Orient offers an excellent corrective to the harsh practical - ity of our restless Occidentalism .

		Comment and With his WOnted i Query on the sure grasp on many or the vital function of fear .

		^ ^ of ^ pleaging anx i ous being of ours , Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	gives us a score of helpful and suggestive and eminently readable chapters on the nature and uses of fear .

		`` Where No Fear Was '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- does not , as its title might lead one to infer , picture a state of existence de - void of terrors of countless kinds , but soberly faces the actuality of things and seeks to derive as much help and useful teaching as are to be had from the multiform manifesta - tions of this omnipresent though often merci - fully latent emotion of our common human nature .

		As is his excellent custom , the writer draws largely on his own experience for the illustration and elaboration of his theme .

		The now happily obsolescent but not yet obsolete fear of eternal punishment he takes early opportunity to dismiss as `` simply inconsis - tent with any belief in the goodness of God . '

		: Cheerful but not blindly optimistic is the 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	chapter on the uses of fear .

		`` Fear is the shadow of the imaginative , the resourceful , the inventive temperament , but it multiplies resource and invention a hundredfold . ''

		Dis - coursing on that form of anxiety which comes from taking oneself too seriously , Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- son interweaves one of those anecdotes from real life that help to give meaning and warmth and vitality to his pages .

		`` I was sitting the other day , ' ' he tells us , '' at a func - tion next a man of some eminence , and I was really amazed at the way in which he dis - coursed of himself and his habits , his diet , his hours of work , and the blank indifference with which he received similar confidences .

		He merely waited till the speaker had fin - ished , and then resumed his own story . ''

		No small part of the value and charm of the book lies in the writer 's full and frank revealment of himself .

		It is the atmosphere of real life and not the musty air of the study that per - vades the volume .

		But this is no new feature of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's writing , nor can any new word of commendation be easily found with which to call attention to his book .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Scattered articles from the pen of the late
William Garrott Brown	PERSON	have been gathered into a volume entitled '' The New Politics and Other Papers '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		All of the articles had appeared in periodicals during the past eight or ten years , and dealt with political and economic questions that were then before the public .

		It must not be supposed , however , that the pub - lishers have erred in seeking to give them perma - nance .

		Though occasioned by immediate situations , they are of more than transient interest .

		The subjects treated are : '' The New Politics , '' '' Pro- phetic Voices about
America	LOCATION	, '' '' The White Peril : The Immediate Danger of the Negro , '' '' The South and the Saloon , '' '' President
Taft	PERSON	's Opportunity , '' and '' Greetings to the Presidents '' -LRB- Presidents Koosevelt ,
Taft	PERSON	, and
Wilson	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The reader is led to wonder , as he turns the pages of '' The Conquest of the Tropics , '' whether Mr.
Frederick TJpham Adams	PERSON	was moved to write the book as an advertisement for the stock of the
United Fruit Company	ORGANIZATION	or to induce tourists to try the steamers of its '' Great White Fleet , '' or as a defence of the company against the charge that it is a trust .

		The publishers -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- frankly state that this is the first of a series to be published concerning '' big business '' enter - prises in this country .

		They have done their part excellently .

		The product is finely printed , illus - trated , and bound , making an attractive volume .

		Unfortunately the title is misleading .

		Aside from one chapter devoted to sanitation there is relatively little concerning the real conquest of the tropics , but a great deal about the origin and methods of the fruit company .

		Cubists and Post-Impressionism By
ARTHUR JEROME EDDY	PERSON	.

		This remarkable work , while broadly historical and descriptive of many men and schools , presents a plea for the public to react to new impressions , and a defence of freedom for the artist to express himself untrammeled by the past .

		The author disclaims any more interest in Cubism than in any other ism , but is concerned in being as open minded to new pictures as to new ideas .

		An en - thusiastic admirer of art , and a collector , his story of the changes of the years by which the maligned and rejected of one period become the esteemed and sought after of another , is epigrammatic in style and attrac - tive in matter .

		Personal acquaintance with painters and paintings and wide study give fluency and power to his pen .

		The book is illustrated by twenty-four color plates and over forty half-tones of the pictures under dis - cussion .

		Should criticism burn tapers and swing censers before the masters of literature , or should it take an axe and smash these idols of the past ?

		The modern spirit , the demo - cratic spirit , is impatient of superiorities .

		It is inconvenient for it to have to worship dead people when it wants to worship its living self .

		It would like to see an Act of Oblitera - tion passed so that everything which hap - pened before it came upon the scene should be cast away .

		It feels confidently able to produce out of its own resources all that any reasonable creature needs in the way of lit - erary or artistic work .

		In some of the
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	, when a man has reached a cer - tain age he is buried in the ground up to his neck and left to his own devices .

		A good many modern writers , artists , and musicians would like to apply this method to their predecessors .

		There is a certain hardship in each age 's struggle to attain expression against the over - whelming mass of expression already in exis - tence .

		In no other field of human effort does the practitioner have to contend with ghosts .

		A living general does not have to array his battalions against
Caesar	PERSON	or Hannibal or
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		A living athlete does not go up against Herakles or
Milo	PERSON	.

		But a book or pic - ture or musical composition has to fight not only against its natural rivals of the present , but against all that has been preserved from the past .

		But what is the past ?

		A book that was published or a picture that was painted yes - terday , belongs just as much to the past as art works of a thousand years ago .

		The human spirit is as fluid as air , but it is just as permanent .

		An idyll of Theocritus , `` Aueassin and
Nicolette	PERSON	, '' a ballad of
Tenny	PERSON	- son , what earthly difference is there be - tween these except a trifle more or less of art and perfection .

		We ought all to be idol wor - shippers , because we all want our own memo - ries preserved .

		The man who smashes an idol does so in the hope of having his own statue set up in its place .

		But what guaran - tees have we that if we cut off the heads of our present rulers , the next generation will 68 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 1	DATE	not dig up our bones and cast them into the common pit ?

		We believe grocers classify four grades of eggs eggs , fresh eggs , strictly fresh eggs , and new-laid eggs .

		There is ever more variety of critical intelligence and taste among human beings , ranging from the crude instincts of the natural man , through various grades of educated opinion , up to the inspired appre - ciator .

		But as everyone has the inalienable right to judge for himself , as he can say that he prefers
Martin Tupper	PERSON	or
Walt Whit	PERSON	- man to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or considers
Jane Austen	PERSON	a greater novelist than
Scott	PERSON	, there is bound to be an immense amount of idol-smashing going on all the time .

		The statues of the true inheritors of the purple line can not be kept on their pedestals without a vast amount of critical effort .

		And revolutions we must have .

		Every age tries to set its stamp upon its artists .

		It is only on condition that they paint its portrait that it allows their images to be set up in the Hall of Fame .

		The portrait painters of a shallow , selfish , and material age will thus be sadly in the way when the inspired delin - eators of a spiritual and heroic age come along .

		And the reverse is true .

		Even the most magnificent outbursts of the art spirit tend in time to become tame and conventional , and a recurrence to a fresher , if shallower , style is necessary .

		But in the end the classics emerge .

		How , it is hard to say , for they usually have to contend with barbarian popularities , they are usually eclipsed in their time by quite sec - ondary figures .

		Shakespeare was eclipsed by
Jonson	PERSON	, by
Fletcher	PERSON	, by
Daniel	PERSON	.

		Goethe was eclipsed by
Klinger	PERSON	, by
Kotzebue	LOCATION	, by
Schiller	PERSON	, by
Jean Paul	PERSON	.

		But the best are finally trium - phant , and the others range themselves in order under them .

		Then we think iconoclasm is out of place .

		Criticism , yes !

		To show how these aristocrats of the intellect and soul dif - fer from one another , to point out in what qualities they are supreme , to show how the secondary figures approach or draw away from them , all this is gratitude 's propi - tiatory offering , it is incense of the most refined kind .

		But to attempt to deal out de - struction to them is like the E erases I ` in fame !

		of the French sans culottes .

		They , though rising in all the ages , have been tried by a common standard , and they are bound to keep their places .

		But what is this common standard ?

		Well , there are hierarchies of art qualities and hier - archies of art forms .

		Taste runs in cycles : the same essential needs of human nature crop up at intervals and require to be ex - pressed .

		Each age gives its authors and artists a list of the things it wants done .

		What one age considers of prime importance may rank low in the opinion of the next : but taking the whole roll of time , it is not diffi - cult to see what are the prime and what are the secondary qualities of art .

		In literature it is first of all necessary that a writer should have something to say and that he should know how to say it .

		The two things usually go together .

		Though the great thinkers may be rare , and the great colorists in words almost to be counted on one 's fin - gers , anyone who has an emotion or an idea can usually find language which will be at least adequate .

		Execution , however , counts for so much in literature that a writer of very inferior intellectual powers who has the in - stinct for the ordering of perfect words may outrank a greater man .

		Creativeness is the next requisite for a great literary artist .

		Do writers create ?

		We believe so : at least they produce something which did not exist in the world before .

		The photographic reproduction of reality is prac - tically impossible , for the dullest and prosiest writer who merely desires to report what he sees has to report it as he sees it , which is differently from anybody else , and quite other than the actual thing .

		On the other hand , a writer 's attempt to juggle with his materials , to use nature and life as masks , to create by the way of allegory and symbolism , results in a secondary kind of art .

		When an artist has to stand before his picture with a wand and explain that his men and women are not men and women but embodiments of moral qualities , that his tree shadows are emblems of evil and his cloud lights symbols of good , such a work may be interesting and an excel - lent puzzle-exercise for the intellect , but it is certainly not as good art as a picture which is intelligible at the first glance .

		It is the same with books .

		When allegorical or sym - bolical literature succeeds it is because read - ers pay no attention to its recondite meanings , but take it as a straightforward narrative of events .

		Power and Beauty divide literature be - tween them .

		To say that the latter rules alone
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 69 seems to us as monstrous as to say that there is only one sex in the world .

		The materials of terror , horror , the grotesque , the ugly , the ludicrous , out of which probably two-thirds of literature is built , have no glimpse of beauty in them ; they have immense power , and they thrill our minds as much as beauty can , though in another way .

		We feel a shock as keenly as we do an attraction .

		To come back to the question of incense and iconoclasm , have not all these art qualities we have enumerated been exercised since the beginning of literature ?

		Has anything new been added in modern or comparatively mod - ern times ?

		It is doubtful .

		There is a cer - tain glamor of image and expression , which seems to belong to
Northern	ORGANIZATION	races , which comes out in the Icelandic sagas , the Irish epics , the Welsh bards , and the Mabinogion , and whose fullest development is in Shake - speare ,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and
Keats	PERSON	.

		But there is something so like it in
Sappho	LOCATION	and Catullus , Theocritus and
Virgil	PERSON	, that it is hardly worth while to make the distinction .

		Probably no French or Italian critic would admit that there is a distinction .

		Literature has passed through all possible phases of thought and expression again and again .

		As with art qualities , so with art forms .

		They were fixed almost at the start .

		There were the epic , the drama , the lyric .

		There were the secondary forms , the idyll , the phil - osophic poem , the prose narrative , the dia - logue , the essay , the epistle .

		Have we really invented anything new ?

		Shakespeare min - gled tragedy and comedy , but so did some of the ancients .

		Herakles in the `` Alcestis '' is a comic figure , and some of Aristophanes 's plays rise to the region of romance if not of tragedy .

		Job 's comforters are decidedly comic , though perhaps unintentionally so .

		We have , we think , invented the novel .

		But there are Greek novels , and the telling of in - terminable stories probably began with the Gave man .

		Scheherazade dates a good way back .

		We hear a good deal now about vers librc .

		Well , the Greeks had their dithyrambic verse , which was free enough .

		In English we had
Skelton	PERSON	's ragged rhyme , the so-called Pindaric odes ,
Milton	PERSON	's and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's irregular blank verse , the long irregular lines of
Blake	PERSON	's Prophetic Books , the rhythmical prose of
Macpherson	ORGANIZATION	's Ossian .

		Much of this is good enough , but none of it is the best .

		A man may be a good actor although he limps and croaks ; but it is hardly worth while to cultivate those disadvantages .

		The very idea of verse is measure and ordered repetition .

		If you want to dispense with these things , why not write prose ?

		A new writer has to-day what a new writer always had , nature and humanity for his materials , words and tones for his tools .

		And he has his individual way of looking at or using these things .

		He may be wise or not to disregard the models of the past ; but he may be very sure that he will not give the world anything new , except the touch of his personality , or his special skill with language .

		Mr.
Comyns Carr	PERSON	tells a delicious story in his recent book , which seems to bear on this matter .

		Lord
Randolph Churchill	ORGANIZATION	meeting
Henry Irving	PERSON	at dinner told him that he had been to see him act Hamlet , but that he had been called away before the conclusion of the play , and would Irving be good enough to tell him how it ended .

		The latter concealed his surprise and gave a sketch of the last acts .

		`` Good , '' said
Lord Randolph	PERSON	, `` I will come and see the whole piece . ' '

		A few nights later he met the actor again , and said that he had not only seen him but had bought the book and read `` Hamlet '' and several other plays by the same author .

		`` And do you know , '' he said , `` I found them extremely in - teresting . ' '

		Lord
Randolph	PERSON	was a strong per - sonality , but he did not come to much , and perhaps part of the secret of this was his disposition to trust to his own resources .

		Our new novelists , poets , artists , and musicians who want to see the dead past bury its dead are in a like case .

		They do not realize that a real work of art is about the most living thing in the world .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		LEGEND MASQUERADING AS HISTORY is too familiar to excite surprise , and too tenacious of its hold on the credulity of the unscholarly to admit of much hope that it will ever be made to relax that hold .

		For instance , the popular conception of Juggernaut -LRB- corrup - tion of the
Sanskrit Jagannatha	LOCATION	, Lord of the World , the name under which
Vishnu	ORGANIZATION	, the Preserver , is worshipped at
Puri	LOCATION	in
Orissa	LOCATION	-RRB- is so far from correct as to ascribe to that god the qualities of
Siva	PERSON	, the Destroyer , rather than those properly belonging to him ; and even a competent writer like
John Forster	PERSON	could allow himself to say , in his life of 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	Dickens : ' ' Pool * Johnny .

		Tetterby staggering under his Moloch of an infant , the Juggernaut that crushed out all his enjoyments . ''

		Long ago Sir
W. W. Hunter	PERSON	, in his `` Gazetteer of
India	LOCATION	, '' made it plain that this Juggernaut legend has no historical basis , unless it be the fact that in any religious ceremony attended by dense throngs of people a life or two may be sacrificed in the press , or a fanatical devo - tee may even sacrifice his own life .

		Another legend that dies hard is that of the supposed witch-burning at Salem .

		The recent destruc - tive fire that wiped out so many ancient land - marks in the old
Massachusetts	LOCATION	town elicited from the
Baltimore	LOCATION	`` Star '' the following : `` On mere suspicion of being witches women were burnt alive .

		We should not be sorry that the old landmarks are gone . ' '

		The witch - craft delusion was bad enough , and
Salem	PERSON	has reason to be ashamed of its participation in the excesses that attended that delusion ; but all
New England	LOCATION	was swept by the incredible superstition , to which even the learned and pious Cotton Mather gave his adherence , and
Salem	PERSON	was not singular in its punishment of suspected persons .

		Nineteen of these were hanged as witches on Gallows Hill , and one ,
Giles Cory	PERSON	, was pressed to death for refusing to plead ; but no burning at the stake took place either at Salem or elsewhere in
New England	LOCATION	.

		Nevertheless popular tradition will always have it that witch-burning is what Salem is chiefly to be remembered for in history .

		AN AUTHOR PESTERED BY AUTOGRAPH-HUNT - ERS has the choice of various ways of more or less gracefully eluding their importunities .

		Few such importunates succeed in eliciting from their victims so rare an epistolary gem as that recently made public by Mr.
Lloyd Osborne	PERSON	, who on
July 27	DATE	placed on sale at
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's a number of letters and manuscript fragments in the handwriting of his step - father .

		The choice bit here referred to is the first draft of a letter to a certain petitioner for
Stevenson	PERSON	's autograph who had committed the blunder of misspelling -LRB- substituting ph for v -RCB- the name of him whose kindness was being thus presumed upon .

		The reply , perhaps needlessly tart , but eminently characteristic , was in part as follows : ' ' The few lines with which you have found time to honor me con - tain certain indications of your character on which I take a pleasure in dwelling .

		They show you so illiterate that I can not judge your admiration flattering ; they show you so careless of giving trouble to me that I am myself careless how much offence I may con - vey to you ; and they are so ill-penned that I am tempted to hope you will discover a difficulty in perusing my answer , and place it unread in your collection ... The next time it shall occur to you to trouble an author as you have troubled me , find out I do not say what he has written far less do I suggest that you should read it but find out how he is in the habit of spelling his unpretentious name and give him upon that point the flat - tery of imitation . ''

		One is naturally curious to know whether the letter was ever sent , or whether , like so many letters that calm second thought consigns to the waste-basket , its mere writing served the purpose of safety-valve and rendered its actual sending as unneces - sary as it would have been , on the whole , unwise .

		HAWTHORNE 'S EXCLUSION FROM
BOSTON	LOCATION	'S HALL OF FAME , a palace of immortality that is to be the abode of one hundred celebrities selected by a competent committee of Bos - tonians , is
Boston	LOCATION	's loss , as all will agree , not
Hawthorne 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The rule requiring that the selected famous one should have done his best work within the city limits , or , if not there , within five miles of
Beacon Hill	LOCATION	, may of course be made to exclude the author of '' The Scar - let Letter , ' ' which was written in Salem .

		But there are not a few readers of
Hawthorne	PERSON	who prefer `` The Blithedale Romance '' to any - thing else produced by its author ; and this admirable work was conceived and written in the rough -LRB- in note-book jottings -RRB- at Brook Farm , now within the city 's bounds , although the finished novel took shape at
West New	LOCATION	- ton , where
Hawthorne	PERSON	lived for several months in
1852	DATE	.

		Why , let us ask , should so much stress be laid on the mere act of writing , when the conceiving and the mental elaboration of a literary masterpiece are the important things ?

		And who knows how much of Haw - thorne 's most fruitful imaginative activity may not have been in
Boston	LOCATION	, which was one of his many places of brief residence , at the time of his holding a position in the
Boston	LOCATION	customhouse , and about which he has written so much , in his `` American Notebooks '' and elsewhere ?

		It surely should not require any dangerous strain on
Boston	LOCATION	's
New England	LOCATION	conscience to claim our first master of prose fiction as her own spiritual citizen , as he was once her bodily resident .

		SIMPLIFIED SPELLING 'S LATEST RECRUITS , it appears from the `` Bulletin , '' from which it is always a pleasure to quote , are the gay and giddy devotees of the turkey trot , the tango , the kitchen sink , and the other curious capers of that class .

		Just how it came about that the dancers were found to be giving aid and
1914	DATE	THE DIAL 71 comfort to the spelling-reformers , is thus explained : `` The keepers of restaurants and saloons hav introduced for the ` entertainment ' of their ` patrons ' the delites of song and dance , in order to stimulate orders for meat and drink .

		Some advertize ` the dansant , ' Avhich is supposed to mean ` dancing tea , ' whatever that may be .

		But the printers often print the frase ` the dansant , ' and the easy ` patrons ' accordingly pronounce it , we sup - pose , ` the dan-sant ' -LRB- daen-saBnt -RRB- , as if paral - lel to ` the can-can ' or ` the one-step . '

		This givs , of course , a clear notion of what a ` dan - sant ' is .

		The occult ` dansant ' has reacted upon the spelling of dance , which now reap - pears sometimes as ` danse ' a good result from a queer source . ''

		Of course `` danse , '' as well as ' ' daunse , '' '' daunce , ' ' and ' ' dance , ' ' has good authority in our early literature , as the writer of the foregoing points out ; and the form thus inadvertently restored by the disciples of Terpsichore has , for the spelling - reformer , this advantage , that its past tense and past participle may be phonetically writ - ten `` danst , '' and these new forms open the way for `` pranse , '' `` pranst , '' and so on .

		Worse things might happen than a general agreement upon one form for the variable and often interchangeable endings - nee , - nse ; but to admit this is by no means to .

		take the `` advanst '' position of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE BIG BOOK FAIR AT
LEIPZIG	LOCATION	, or , in official language , the ' ' Internationale Ausstellung f iir Buchgewerbe und Graphik , ' ' has opened most auspiciously .

		In its first six weeks , and before the vacation season had well begun , the turn - stiles recorded the visits of more than a million interested sight-seers , who have had displayed before them all the marvellous proc - esses known to the arts of printing and illus - tration .

		Divided into eighty sections , the vast exhibition presents everything conceiva - ble in connection with the impressing of visible or -LRB- for the blind -RRB- tangible marks on plain surfaces , from the stamping of oilcloth to the printing and illustration of the edition de luxe and the manufacture of books in raised type .

		The busy book-producing
Saxon	PERSON	city , noted for its annual book-market , is just the place for holding such an exposition as the present .

		Printing in the land of its birth -LRB- with apologies to
China	LOCATION	-RRB- is symbolized and glorified by the heroic statue of
Gutenberg	ORGANIZATION	unveiled a few weeks ago in the centre of the splendid fair that may be said to owe its existence to the inventive genius of
Mainz	LOCATION	who , almost five centuries ago , began those opera - tions with movable wooden types that have led to such astonishing results .

		Not the least admirable and creditable part of this great exhibition is the American section , as many of our compatriots will discover for themselves before the season closes .

		THE WORLD 'S GREATEST PUBLISHING HOUSE , .

		as the `` Book Bulletin '' of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	informs its readers , is the govern - ment printing establishment at
Washington	LOCATION	f `` the finest and best-equipped in the world r and no nation approaches this country in the effort to enlighten its people through the me - dium of printers ' ink .

		Nearly
six million dollars	MONEY	has been appropriated this year to maintain the government printing office .

		At enormous additional cost for expert service , the government secures the material for its publications on all sorts of subjects .

		Some of the publications are in the form of portly books , some are bulletins , some are circulars , and an important section comprises maps . ''

		And , furthermore , some of the publications are windy political harangues , printed in the ' .

		` Congressional Record '' as if actually deliv - ered before our national legislators -LRB- though never actually inflicted on any audience -RRB- , and sent out at public expense in thousands of copies , to remain unread by as many unap - preciative constituents of the senders .

		No private publishing house could endure for a week the enormous waste that gives so little concern to those who year after year pay for the maintenance of this biggest printing and publishing plant in the world .

		THE LATEST BACONIAN ABSURDITY takes the form of a bulky volume by a certain Mr.
Har	PERSON	- man , an Englishman , who sets himself the stupendous task of proving that the Lord Chancellor wrote , in addition to his own and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's works and sundry other books of his time ,
Spenser	PERSON	's `` Faerie Queene '' and `` Shepherd 's Calendar , ''
Samuel Daniel	PERSON	's letter from
Octavia	LOCATION	to
Mark Antony	PERSON	, and a number of other things that have hitherto escaped the Baconian drag-net and been allowed to mask themselves under spurious authorship .

		Mr.
Harman	PERSON	's six hundred pages are little likely to become household words on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, or indeed on either side , and most readers of this brief notice will probably content themselves with such second - hand information about the book as is here offered .

		The title of the work is ``
Edmund Spenser	PERSON	and the Impersonations of
Francis Bacon	PERSON	. ''

		Why would it not be shorter and simpler , instead of proving the Baconian authorship of so many Elizabethan books , one at a time , to establish the non-Baconian origin of such few as may fairly be allowed to other 72 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 1	DATE	writers , and then lump all the rest of the lit - erature of the period under
Lord Bacon	PERSON	's name ?

		A FORTHCOMING LITERARY `` SENSATION '' is foreshadowed by the
London	LOCATION	correspondent of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' who says he has received confidential information about an important book soon to be issued and to contain a most dramatic disclosure of the liveliest interest in political circles .

		`` It is permissible to add , '' he continues , `` that the book in question is a ` Life of Cardinal Man - ning , ' and that it will contain correspondence between a retired parliamentary leader and an Irishman who was much in the public eye over twenty years ago .

		In this correspon - dence is one outstanding fact , and in that fact lies the ` sensation . ' '

		It is a cruel position to be in restrained by a sense of honor from revealing a choice secret that will very likely leak out before long through some less con - scientious channel .

		Would one , we wonder , be getting `` warm '' if one were to guess that the Irishman ' ' much in the public eye s over twenty years ago ' ' is
Charles Stewart Parnell	PERSON	?

MEXICO	LOCATION	'S FIRST BOOK , which is believed to have been also
America	LOCATION	's first book , was printed on a primitive press sent over in
1535	DATE	in the charge of Juan Pablos by
Jules Crom	PERSON	- berger , who had opened a printing house in
Seville	LOCATION	and was led to hope that a similar establishment in the transatlantic Spanish pos - sessions would prove a profitable business ven - ture .

		Thus it came about that in the year
1536	DATE	there appeared in
Mexico City	LOCATION	a Spanish book of a religious character , bearing the title -LRB- we give it in translation -RRB- , `` A Spiritual Lad - der for Reaching Heaven . ''

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		PROFESSOR
BRANDES	PERSON	AND AMERICAN CULTURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		After a journey of three weeks , Professor
Brandes	PERSON	is making known his impressions of
America	LOCATION	.

		They are crystallized in this bright jewel : '' the country of the shaved barbarians . ''

		It is true that even after having been personally feasted out of reason , every superlative being called into action to reflect his greatness , Professor
Brandes	PERSON	could not justly be expected to heap com - pliments upon the country he saw in brief , kaleido - scopic reflex .

		Nevertheless , '' the land of the shaved barbarians '' will impress many of us who are obliged to remain behind and to sustain the
Ameri	PERSON	- can form of life , with the feeling that some apparently decent person spits in our face .

		Professor
Brandes	PERSON	, writing in the '' Politiken , '' finds that
America	LOCATION	possesses the material basis for highly developed mental culture , but no more .

		He compares contemporary
America	LOCATION	with
Europe	LOCATION	of the dark ages , and finds that they agree appre - ciably .

		The accumulation of vast personal wealth in great commercial centers , and the visible use of this wealth for the purpose of mental culture through great universities and museums , this is , as it was in early
Europe	LOCATION	, the beginning of a period of culture in
America	LOCATION	.

		Thereupon the genius ap - pears , organizing a cultural development , that human genius commonly called the great man , who needs and utilizes all the outward things , money , the university milieu , laboratories and institutional apparatus generally .

		In advancing this view Professor
Brandes	PERSON	fulfils the prophecy of Disraeli , who warned us of the time when comfort should be mistaken for culture .

		It is a view common enough in
Europe	LOCATION	, but scarcely worthy of Professor
Brandes	PERSON	.

		He might be expected to recollect
Disraeli	PERSON	's warning well enough to rise above the common European cultural egotism , according to which you swim on the crest of a cultural wave if you insure for yourself a liberal income and the greatest possible amount of modern improvement in material comfort .

		In
America	LOCATION	this view of life generally is discredited .

		As for the universities , only a short time ago Presi - dent
Jordan	PERSON	called attention to their danger of being over-equipped with material comforts .

		Pre - viously , amidst a modest equipment , the student and the investigator were obliged to devise their own minor apparatus ; to struggle with difficulties and to overcome them ; to work ahe #d without awaiting an endowment .

		Nowadays you press a button for this , issue an order for that , draw on this fund or obtain support from that ; but all these outward facilities do not , in themselves , stim - ulate independent activity in research , and the material endowments do not result in a propor - tionate mental and scientific activity .

		Rags certainly are not , per se , a comfort , yet there is no causal relation between accumulated commercial wealth and human culture .

		Moreover , cultural development in the past almost invariably involved an explosion of some superstition touch - ing the importance of some material power .

		Real progress in human culture is not assisted by being an object of institutional protection : it acts inde - pendently until it has conquered .

		Professor
Brandes	PERSON	is greatly mistaken in antici - pating for
America	LOCATION	any cultural progress save that which is based upon idea and will-power .

		Human culture , as a standard of measurement for social conditions ; human culture as a climax in the activity of numerous , mutually incongruous forces influencing national and individual life ; human culture as the spontaneous utterance of genius in man : will these problems be solved in
America	LOCATION	ex - actly in the same way as in
Europe	LOCATION	?

		THE TRUTH ABOUT RECONSTRUCTION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the issue of THE DIAL for
July 1	DATE	there ap - pears a letter on '' The Character of the Mexican People '' from Mr.
E. L. C. Morse	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		In the course of his remarks Mr.
Morse	PERSON	, desiring to draw an analogy , goes somewhat out of his way to sneer at the
American Negro	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two millions of the inhabitants of
Mexico	LOCATION	, he informs us , are white people , chiefly of Spanish origin .

		The remaining twelve millions are of mixed Indian ancestry : `` A psychological anthropologist would probably call them morons physically adults , mentally chil - dren .

		In that respect they are much like our negroes before the war . ''

		Further on we read : '' Many of our good people half a century ago assumed that the negro had high and lofty aspira - tions for constitutional government and political freedom . ''

		Then follows once more the charge of the Negro 's incompetency as shown in the days of Reconstruction , with all the old story of graft , lack of political insight , etc. , etc. .

		Is it not about time that a stop should be put to these old slurs and slanders on the Negro ?

		Simple historical accuracy to-day demands that the facts of Reconstruction be studied without prejudice and with a reasonable amount of care .

		No situa - tion that has ever arisen in American history has received more gross exaggeration than the tale of the ex-slave 's shortcomings when he was given a chance in the political life of the nation .

		Why ?

		Because it is the popular thing to give the Negro a kick .

		As a matter of fact the Negro was for the most part simply the victim of the greed of men far more criminal and at the time more capable than himself .

		Major
John R. Lynch	PERSON	has recently shown us in `` The Facts of Reconstruction '' -LRB- issued by the
Neale Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- that in
Mississippi	LOCATION	, where the Negroes reached the highest political power , they at no time had more than thirty-four out of the 140 members of the Legis - lature ; but that they took part in those govern - ments which put the Southern states in harmony with the nation and that they helped to plan and organize the present Southern common school sys - tem .

		In view of such facts as these , current and popular exaggerations would at least seem to be in need of modification .

		IMPRESSIONISTIC CRITICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I agree with your correspondent , Mrs.
Laura Tobey	PERSON	, on the lack of value of '' grocer-shop criti - cism . ''

		The trouble with such criticism is that it presupposes a standard of absolutes of literary weights and measures which does n't exist .

		Peo - ple have not yet succeeded in reducing life to any commensurate values of quarts or ounces , and it is futile to expect in the critic a higher sensibility of perception than in the creative artist who is in the first place molded by life before he attempts to turn life into a mold and that mold not neces - sarily standardized in relation to the perception of antecedent artists .

		Then , in spite of the agreed - upon grocer-weight standard of measure , there is always the liability of human fallibility in the grocer ... However noble in intention , there is no such thing as an honest grocer in literary criti - cism .

		That is to say , there is no such thing as an objective critic .

		The only honest course , therefore , for literary criticism is that of frank impressionism ad - mitting , as it does , the likelihood of human error in judging a work of human intelligence , and striving simply to record an honest impression , no more and no less .

		Speaking from experience , I can say that the work of impressionistic critics is the only sort of criticism from which I have gained any real sense of values in regard to a new book of fiction , or a new play , or a new poem .

		Even when I have temperamentally so consistently dis - agreed with a particular reviewer as to buy always the books he disparaged , and to shun , for the most part , those he recommended , I have yet admitted by this very process the worth of his impres - sionistic judgment .

		From the so-called grocer-shop criticism I have derived neither the profit of coincident conviction nor the pleasure of honest disagreement .

		This de - vitalized theory of criticism simply reduces itself to an algebraic formula in which the reader 's interest and enjoyment represent zero .

		Is it not significant that grocer-shop criticism almost always parades under the mask of anonym - ity ?

		It is the uniform of the so-called '' sound reviewer , '' whose personality is various and may be interchanged ad lib. , without any noticeable change in the product .

		Indeed , the instrument is fitted , interchangeably , for any commodity on the market .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	eto MR. SHAWS NEW PREFACE .

		*
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has done more than any of his contemporaries to reconcile us to the thorough-going moralistic attitude , and he has done so by insisting that the conquest of morality is at least as difficult and dangerous as the quest of the Holy Grail .

		Odd that we should need to be reminded of anything so obvious .

		Yet in spite of the martyrdom of saints and the torture of heretics , in spite of Luther and
John Knox	PERSON	, we are given to think - ing of morality in terms of submission rather than in terms of revolt .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	will not hear of this morality , which he has identified for his own purposes with the current sub - urban morality .

		As a matter of fact , we may doubt whether its influence is really so per - vasive ; it is pretty certain that it has never gripped the masculine half of the race , how - ever much it may have served to console his mate in less militant epochs than ours .

		But it has been preached persistently by myopic persons of the best intentions , who remained blissfully unaware that it is rarely applied in practice .

		Those who fancy a quiet life only follow a profound instinct when they discourage the rise of a new moralist .

		Traditional morality is a convenient substitute for earnest thought .

		Those who disturb it , make us uncomfortable , and we revenge ourselves by calling them im - moralists , as in the case of Ibsen , or irre - sponsible paradoxers , as in the case of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	.

		It is a convenient way of evading the issue .

		But Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	was determined that the issue should not be evaded , and he would not be Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	if he had not had his way .

		Neither would comfortable abstract discussion serve , the futility of such discussion being sufficiently proved by the experience of those clergymen who find that they can continue to draw their salaries only by avoiding the concrete .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, with the instinct of the dramatist , wrapped the Seven Deadly Sins in the trappings of our industrial civilization , and left them to point the moral .

		But it will hardly do , either , to say that he left his puppets to point the moral : he did not ; he pulled up the curtain on the show , which he had first taken the trouble to make as amusing as possible , and then stepped to the front of the stage and harangued the mob in a preface .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has ingeniously de - fended what surely needs no defence his reliance on the preface .

		Doubtless he was sin - * MISALLIANCE , THE DARK LADY OF THE SONNETS , AND FANNY 'S FIRST PLAY .

		With a Treatise on Parents and
Chil	ORGANIZATION	- dren .

		By
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Brentano 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		cere enough in what he said ; only one doubts whether he said all that was in his mind .

		Ordinarily , the playwright leaves the writing of his preface to the professional critic .

		But Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	had seen what the critics did to
Ibsen	LOCATION	; that their ineptitudes and pathetic trivialities made a deep impression on his mind , is sufficiently apparent from the ex - tended excerpts he has ironically handed on to posterity in `` The Quintessence of Ibsen - ism . ''

		Could , then , a serious dramatist , bent on handling subjects of the utmost social sig - nificance , trust himself to be interpreted by a group of amiable aesthetes , whom he himself had described as faineants ?

		Whether he ac - tually asked himself this question or not , it is certain that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	did not hesitate to assume the risk of explaining his own mes - sage , an exceedingly delicate and difficult task in which he has absolutely no equal .

		So true is this that it is nothing but a work of supererogation to attempt to interpret Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, even if the attempt is not simply an ineptitude and consequently an impertinence .

		Those of us who delight in Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as a man with an infinite capacity for life and civic responsibility , do not in the least regret his facility in self-explanation , though when we are a bit impatient we may allow ourselves the trite remark that his skill in the preface is a measure of his limitation as a dramatist .

		We simply seize a shabby old idea one of those aesthetic ideas about which Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has happily shown so little curiosity and say that no first-rate creative gift has ever been so immediately intelligible , either to itself or others .

		What of it ?

		We may be sure that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	has so profound a distaste for vagueness that we may doubt whether the possession of genius like
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's could compensate him for the sense in himself of something he could not fully comprehend .

		And apropos of the prefaces , the impression somehow prevails that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's ideas have the precision and inexorable unfolding of a proposition from
Euclid	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	speaks with a shudder of his remorseless logic and unanswerable common sense .

		But if we think of Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	as a person puffed up with the logician 's silly pride in his logic as a weapon sufficient for any occasion , is it not because we are so largely occupied with the fictitious
Shaw	PERSON	of the reporters rather than with the genuine
Shaw	PERSON	of the prefaces ?

		It would be nearer the truth to insist that what he has sought to give us is less a programme than a point of view .

		No , although he possesses enough ideas to set a score of doc - trinaires up in business , he is not himself a doctrinaire .

		He is concerned with the spirit rather than with the letter .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL .

		75 No better instance , indeed , of the con - cealed but still discernible modesty with which Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	offers to arrange our destiny could be cited than his latest volume of plays .

		If he were really the prideful logician we care - lessly assume him to be , he would not have written two of the plays in this volume `` Misalliance '' and `` Fanny 's First Play , '' the third being nothing but a Shakespearean jeu d' esprit .

		For he is here engaged in ex - ploring the problem of parents and children ; and , although his moralist 's hope of a better humanity rests squarely on the child , it would be idle to pretend that he has given us any - thing like a programme for improving the state of the child .

		He can not tell us in detail what we ought to do , though he has no hesita - tion in telling us what we ought not to do his task there being reduced to a simple description of our actual practice .

		The two chief influences in the life of the child are , of course , the home and the school .

		In the well-known Shavian view , the middle - class home is no place for any social being ; .

		it is exclusive and narrow ; a place where people make affection an excuse for deplorable manners .

		It is bad for adults , impossible for children .

		A child has no political rights ; it is a chattel , the exclusive possession of its parents , who may ruin it as effectually by too much petting as by too much beating .

		And the problem is further complicated by the fact that a child is a nuisance to a grown-up per - son .

		`` What is more , the nuisance becomes more and more intolerable as the grown-up person becomes more cultivated , more sensi - tive , and more deeply engaged in the highest methods of adult work .

		The child at play is noisy and ought to be noisy : Sir
Isaac New	PERSON	- ton at work is quiet and ought to be quiet . ' '

		Moreover , real understanding can not exist between an adult and a creature so essen - tially cruel and selfish as a child .

		It is idle to pretend that the family provides children with edifying adult society .

		Here , as in so many other respects , the home is nothing but a humbug .

		Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	finds proof of this in the fact that parents who can afford to send their children to a board school will not have them at home .

		The parents , of course , will tell you that they have to educate their chil - dren ; but Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	denies that the school exists to educate children ; it exists to take them off their parents ' hands .

		And what is this process of education like ? ''

		With the world 's bookshelves loaded with fas - cinating and inspired books , the very manna sent down from Heaven to feed your souls , you are forced to read a hideous imposture called a book , written by a man who can not write : a book from which no human being can learn anything : a book which , though you may decipher it , you can not in any fruitful sense read , though the enforced at - tempt will make you loathe the sight of a book all the rest of your life .

		With millions of acres of woods and valleys and hills and wind and air and birds and streams and fishes and all sorts of in - structive and healthy things easily accessible , or with streets and shop windows and crowds and vehicles and all sorts of city delights at the door , you are forced to sit , not in a room with some human grace and comfort of furniture and decora - tion , but in a stalled pound with a lot of other children , beaten if you talk , beaten if you move , beaten if you can not prove by answering idiotic questions that even when you escaped from the pound and from the eye of your gaoler , you were still agonizing over his detestable sham books in - stead of daring to live . ''

		As a partial corrective of this black picture , one may say at once that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	frankly admits he was not beaten ; but he assures us he was sent to a schoolmaster so excep - tionally indifferent that he was allowed to escape without learning anything .

		If neither the home nor the school will do for the child -LRB- which is , in the Shavian view , a fresh experi - ment of the
Life Force	ORGANIZATION	trying to improve on its parents -RRB- , what then ?

		Here Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	ex - plicitly confesses the inadequacy of logic : '' I must not pretend , then , that I have a system ready to replace all the other systems .

		Obstruct - ing the way of the proper organization of child - hood , as of everything else , lies our ridiculous misdistribution of the national income , with its accompanying class distinctions and imposition of snobbery on children as a necessary part of their social training .

		The result of our economic folly is that we are a nation of undesirable acquaintances ; and the first object of all our institutions for chil - dren is segregation . ''

		We ask for a solution of this most perplex - ing of problems the problem of the child - and Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	murmurs vaguely about a world made more habitable for children by Social - ism .

		But he does not pretend , you see , that he has a programme .

		What he wishes is to emphasize the spirit in which he thinks we should go to work .

		Take the case of political rights .

		Not the most astute of statesmen , ac - tuated by the most humane motives , could remove that disability of the child .

		As long as there are parents , children will be largely at their mercy .

		But this does not prevent us from hoping that we may in time improve the condition of the child by improving the in - telligence of the parents .

		And what Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	would have parents see , is that their posses - sion of the child does not involve the right to do with it as they see fit , to coerce it into satisfying their own ideas as to a career or a religion , and to playing generally the part of providence as if they were omniscient beings .

		And as to the school , the same principle ap - 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	plies .

		It may be necessary to teach some things dogmatically , but ... `` The man who believes that he has more than a provisional hypothesis to go upon is a born fool . ''

		It is not necessary to impress that fact upon the pupil , but until a teacher has grasped it , he is not fit for his task .

		CHAUCER AND THE ROMAN DE
L.A BOSK	LOCATION	.

		* Few books in the whole realm of extant lit - erature have exerted a more profound and widespread influence upon literary men and their work than did the Roman de la Rose in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It belongs now to a dead past , a past of obsolete or obsolescent ideas and ideals , and few there are to do it reverence .

		All readers of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, however , will remem - ber that in his youth he translated a part of this immense and popular poem , while even the casual student must have noticed how in his later work he adapted its technique and humanized -LRB- that is , humorized -RRB- its philoso - phy .

		Chaucer 's debt to the two authors of the Roman , the gentle
Guillaume de Lorris	PERSON	and the cynical
Jean de Meung	PERSON	, has been the subject of a deal of scholarly research with the usual polar results , one school mak - ing Chaucer a servile imitator and the other erecting him into complete independence .

		The most recent contribution to the sub - ject , `` Chaucer and the Roman de la Rose '' by Dean
Spruill Fansler	PERSON	, has no extreme thesis to maintain , and so in all probability wins closer to the truth * but it pays the pen - alty of too much qualification .

		It has no out - and-outness .

		Much of the time the author appears to be differing just a little from some other investigator who has stated con - clusions in the same field .

		Still the book is worth while in that Mr.
Fansler	PERSON	has followed a different and more significant method in his study ; he has classified
Chaucer	PERSON	's bor - rowings `` according to the nature of the pas - sages taken over . ''

		By this method he has arrived at some trustworthy conclusions on the interesting question : which of the authors of the Roman influenced Chaucer more ?

		Briefly this is the answer : Chaucer went to de Lorris for lessons in technique , especially in description , but was never a mere imi - tator .

		He went to
Jean de Meung	ORGANIZATION	for a rhyming dictionary , for bibliography , and for encyclopaedic knowledge on various subjects ; but he never accepted any wholesale carton of Jean 's opinion : where they show marked * CHAUCER AND THE ROMAN DB LA ROSE .

		similarity , they are both children of their age .

		In the author 's anxiety to free Chaucer of all stigma of unrighteous imitation , he sometimes falls into tame personal expres - sions of faith , such as this : '' ... it is im - possible to think of Chaucer writing the Parlement , Hous of Fame , and Prologue to the Legend in serious rivalry of foreign models .

		I feel convinced that in these poems he had a deeper , subtler purpose , even though at present I can not say just what it was . ''

		A very doubtful critical dictum is cited from Professor Kittredge : `` The cynicism of the Merchant 's Tale is ... in no sense expres - sive of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's own sentiments , or even of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's momentary mood .

		The cynicism is the Merchant 's .

		It is no more
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's than lago 's cynicism about love is Shake - speare 's . ''

		The comparison with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	here is rather unfortunate since Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	has recently made out a very strong presumption of that very thing in Shake - speare .

		A man of genius has more than one facet , and poets especially never feel the necessity of being consistent .

		The parts are never greater than the whole ; and we may be sure that if a poet ever invented a plausi - ble devil , he had a plausible devil in him the day he made the invention .

		The tables of parallel lines and passages appended are invaluable to the student ; and the book is really a masterly thesis if not an epochal contribution to

		THE PRESIDENT OF

		* A few years ago
M. Raymond Poincare	PERSON	wrote for a publication circulating princi - pally among young people in
France	LOCATION	a series of simple articles descriptive of the origins and workings of the French governmental system , national and local .

		At the time nei - ther he nor any other person could have fore - seen that in

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 77 well stand entirely upon their own merit .

		To a high order of legal scholarship the author adds a rare fund of information acquired through twenty-five years of experience as a legislator and six years as a minister of state , and he is a master of that lightness and sure - ness of touch which is the glory of French writing upon political , as upon other , sub - jects .

		Simplicity and directness of statement will render the book attractive to persons who are but beginning the study of government ; yet the subject matter is sufficiently weighty and authoritative to give the work a value for the most erudite expert in the field .


M. Poincare	PERSON	introduces his subject in a nat - ural and agreeable manner by devoting his earlier chapters to the history and organiza - tion of the commune and the department .

		He then turns to the national government and in a general chapter sketches the growth of the French monarchy to the eighteenth cen - tury , the changes wrought by the Revolution , and the fundamental aspects of the state as organized to-day .

		Another chapter outlines the development of the concept of national sovereignty from the time when
Gaul	PERSON	was a Roman province to the establishment of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	and of its representative sys - tem based upon manhood suffrage .

		Although it is not so stated , one may surmise that the indifference of voters which is exhibited so frequently at parliamentary elections in
France	LOCATION	is responsible for the forcefulness with which the author seeks to inculcate the idea that under the present democracy abstention from voting is `` both a piece of foolishness and a civic desertion . ''

		The exclusion of women , he asserts , is justified `` only by con - siderations of opportunism or by the resis - tance of custom . ''

		The bulk of the volume consists of chapters dealing successively with the constitution , the presidency , the ministry , the legislative cham - bers , justice , public education , the budget and taxation , and military service .

		Material which might easily be presented in a fashion remarkable chiefly for dryness is put before the reader concretely and attractively , and not without occasional flashes of pertinent humor .

		It was doubtless only after reflection that
M. Poincare	PERSON	left out of the plan of the book a treatment of the rise , organization , and workings of political parties .

		The omission , however , must be adjudged a serious one .

		No description of the structure of the govern - mental system can convey a satisfactory idea of how
France	LOCATION	, or any other country , is governed unless it is supplemented with a characterization of the organizations and affiliations through which the people act in political matters .

		M.
Poincare	ORGANIZATION	describes the static aspects of the French government ad - mirably , but he has little or nothing to say of those not less important aspects which are dynamic .

		It is true that the French party system is complicated and difficult to describe in brief and general phrases .

		But there is no good reason why there should not have been included in the present volume at least one chapter explaining how candidates for the
Chamber of Deputies	ORGANIZATION	are nominated and how they carry on their campaigns , showing how party groups arise and act , and describing the organization and principles of a few of the more important groups , including the Socialists .

		On account of recent legislation raising the period of active , military service from two to three years , a portion of the chapter on mili - tary service is already out of date .

		A MIDDLE-IRISH ROMANCE .

		* The twelve volumes already issued by the Irish Texts Society make a respectable show - ing upon any book shelf , and all students of literature ought to rejoice that extended docu - ments from the great storehouse of mediaeval Irish manuscripts are thus made accessible .

		Not that anybody is going to neglect the news - paper or the latest novel to read these me - diaeval Irish histories and romances .

		Of necessity the English translations in this pio - neer series must be scrupulously literal ; and literal translations , even from languages which like French and German are more akin to ours than Irish , are seldom attractive to the general reader .

		This matters little .

		The material is accessible in trustworthy form , and many people will find that its novelty over - balances the tedium of a literal translation .

		This mass of Irish writing can not lack sig - nificance to a student of literature .

		Literary influence , like electricity , passes from point to point in ways not obvious .

		The debt that English literature owes to Irish has not yet been estimated .

		But no one can doubt that such a debt exists .

		It is enough to recall that the beautiful story of `` Sir

Maepherson	LOCATION	's Ossian , once set lit - erary
Europe	LOCATION	ablaze .

		It is within the bounds of possibility that these stories published by the Irish Texts Society may exert at some un - expected point an effect upon the letters of to-day .

		The text before us , `` The Adventures of Suibhne Geilt , '' is well edited , and the intro - duction is good , although a connection urged between
Merlin	PERSON	and Suibhne probably lacks all foundation .

		The story is told in prose , with poems interspersed after the manner usual in early Irish .

		Suibhne -LRB-
Sweeny	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- was an Irish king of the seventh century , who incurred the curse of
St. Ronan	ORGANIZATION	at the battle of Magh RJath , and in consequence went crazy -LRB- Geilt -RRB- .

		In his madness he was perhaps transformed into a bird , or anyhow he believed that he was a bird , and could fly from tree to tree , and even accomplish long journeys in the air .

		Other maniacs in Irish and Scandinavian story have been credited with similar volant exploits .

		That some madmen , and some saints as well , possessed supernatural powers of leaping or flying was evidently a widespread belief , and a study of this supposed phenomenon of levi - tation is an interesting investigation which awaits some competent hand .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	long ago made us ac - quainted with the `` natural magic '' of the Celts .

		Although ' ' The Adventures of Suibhne Geilt '' is by no means a fairy story , it is per - meated with natural magic .

		The mad king flits from tree to tree and from forest to for - est , and his wanderings in the open give a chance for the poet to express a love of out-of - door life , and a delight in the charms of this or that sequestered spot in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		Nebuchad - nezzar dwelt with the beasts of the field and ate grass like oxen for seven years , ' ' until his hairs were grown like eagles ' feathers , and his nails like birds ' claws . ''

		King Suibhne 's ad - venture reminds us of
King Nebuchadnez	LOCATION	- zar 's ; but unlike the more ancient monarch , Suibhne never recovers from his madness .

		The Irish story is also altogether separated from the Biblical narrative , because in it we inevitably take Suibhne 's point of view and sympathize with him in his joys and sorrows in the forest .

		King Suibhne sings to us of the frosty wind , and of the darkness of the trees ' branches during winter 's storm , of the squeal of the badgers , the bellowing of the stags , the yelp - ing of the foxes , the calling of the hounds , and again , when
summer	DATE	comes , of the clamor of the cuckoo .

		Even the water cress and the cold stream which supplied his food and drink he describes as fair and clean .

		This mediaeval
Thoreau	PERSON	prefers the cooing of the turtle dove to the talk of people , the war - bling of the blackbird to the sound of the cloister bell , the cry of the mountain grouse to the voice of a beautiful woman , the chant of the hounds to the service of the church , and a couch among the branches to the softest bed in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		The love and appreciation for the things of the forest , and the natural magic of the story , may appeal to the reader of to-day .

Rudolf Eucken	PERSON	was keenly interested in religious problems ; but in
1871	DATE	, having been appointed Professor of Philosophy -LRB- first at
Basel	LOCATION	, soon afterward at
Jena	PERSON	-RRB- , he `` sought to suppress the religious interest altogether , '' and devoted himself whole-heartedly to academic philosophy .

		A lesser man , under these circumstances , might gradually have ceased to have any functional relationship to the world at large ; but such atrophy was not possible to
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's ener - getic and sympathetic nature , and as he says , `` the old interest would not die . ''

		In the course of forty years , in which he increasingly sought to connect his philosophical problems with the needs of human existence , the importance of taking a definite stand on re - ligious matters appeared continually more evident .

		Yet he held back , hoping that added years and experience would enable him to treat the subject more worthily .

		At length , however , he has felt free to write , realizing the approach of old age , and the probability that his powers will not increase .

		Thus , what - ever we may think of Professor
Eucken	PERSON	's opinions , we must at least accord them the respect due to the product of many years of labor , not offered hastily to create a sensation , but after prolonged consideration and recon - sideration .

		The groundwork of
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's whole posi - tion is the proposition that human life has a spiritual side which gives it its real meaning and value .

		It is this postulate , in various forms , which gives validity to religion , and leads us to deny the adequacy of any mech - anistic conception of the universe .

		Although Eucken professes himself opposed to prag - matism , we find him justifying religion on genuinely pragmatic grounds , those of human necessity .

		It is not that God must be ap - peased , or that some plan of creation may be carried out , but that we , living creatures on this earth , may reach our proper estate and significance .

		It is not necessary to de - fine what we mean by `` spiritual , '' all his - * CAN WE STILL BE CHRISTIANS ?

New York	LOCATION	: The
Mnc	ORGANIZATION	- millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1914 THE DIAL 79 tory and our own natures are eloquent as to that ; nor is it difficult to prove that this quality is here , there , and everywhere in dan - ger of being crowded out of our lives .

		All this may be freely admitted , and still we may ask , why so much concern ?

		Has it not always been thus , from the dawn of history ?

		Has not religion shown sufficient capacity for self-preservation ?

		Are we to suppose that this ancient instinct , rooted in the very na - ture of man , is now in danger of extinction ?

		Complacent natures may thus console them - selves , but even if the argument is valid , it still remains true that whatever of spiritual value has been won and held in the past , has been gained and retained at the expense of strenuous effort .

		Our
Jena	PERSON	philosopher , at the very least , is successor to a long line of defenders of the faith , illustrious supporters of our most cherished traditions .

		The matter is , however , by no means so simple .

		The last century has transformed our manner of living and thinking , and the new wine will by no means remain in the old bottles .

		Consequently those who care for religion , but also love truth and respond to modern needs , find themselves between two hostile camps , that of the dogmatists and that of the materialists .

		It is impossible to abandon the very foundations of religion , and sink into a crass materialism , which car - ried to its logical end would destroy all we deem most precious .

		It is equally impossible to ally ourselves with the churches , which continue to defend statements which we can no longer believe to be true , and uphold doc - trines which offend our moral as well as our logical sense .

		Although our position is in a sense midway between these opposite ex - tremes , it is better thought of as representing a third corner of a triangle , as distinct and salient as either of the others .

		Such a posi - tion will be condemned by the materialists , who will urge that while we abandon the more obviously erroneous premises of cur - rent religions , we nevertheless adhere to their consequences , being unable to perceive the necessary connection .

		The orthodox relig - ionists will use exactly the same argument , except that they will affirm that the rejected premises are sound .

		Thus attacked from both sides , with essentially the same weapons , Eucken simply replies that the spiritual side of man exists , and did exist long before the present dogmas were invented ; that -LRB- if the reviewer may supply an illustration not used by the author -RRB- the enemy 's position is about as reasonable as that of a man who should maintain that there could be no such thing as gravitation , were we to believe that as a matter of fact the apple did not fall on
Newton	ORGANIZATION	's head !

		At this point some would urge that since man 's spiritual nature is in - herent and fundamental , it will take care of itself ; but to this it is replied that it re - quires cultivating , and will not develop with - out effort ; and moreover , that success is not wholly a matter to be determined by the in - dividual , but must depend largely upon social conditions .

		Here we come to the question indicated by the title of the book : can we adopt as our own the Christian tradition , which has meant so much in ages past , and now seems to be on the wane ?

		At first , the answer seems to be in the negative .

		We posi - tively must reject the fundamental Christian dogma , believing it to be untrue , and even incompatible with our present religious posi - tion .

		Is this , then , to exclude ourselves from Christianity altogether ?

		Professor Eucken discusses at length the Catholic and Protes - tant churches , and decides that it is impossi - ble to seek alliance with either .

		There only remains , as a last resort , a Christianity out - side of the churches , a new Christianity which shall embody and transmit all the spiritual gains of the past , while rejecting that which is no longer of value .

		How this is to be de - veloped , the author does not clearly explain ; but after all it is a fact that such a new Christianity does exist , and is in many subtle ways transforming the religious thought of the world .

		Professor
Eucken	PERSON	has not offered us anything really new ; he has merely set forth the existing situation in clear and un - mistakable language , calling us to sift the wheat from the chaff , sow it in the fertile fields of our minds , and look forward to a golden harvest .

		... ... .

		One of the most interesting con - A
Virginia	LOCATION	editor , , , , , , - , , / , , of tributions to the history of the ante-beuumdays .

		United states , which has ap - peared during the past year , is the work which Professor
C. H. Ambler	PERSON	has entitled ' '
Thomas Kitchie	PERSON	, A Study in
Virginia	LOCATION	Politics . ''

		-LRB-
Pri	ORGANIZATION	- vately published . -RRB-

		Whether or not History be past Politics , politicians or statesmen , the many or the few , have held the centre of the stage of historical biography .

		It is indeed time to go behind the scenes and study the influence exerted by the political manager , great or small , who has performed the function of organization and education in party politics .

		Of course there have been such biographies , but few of them thus far have avoided the faults that arise from hero worship or family affection , or those which
spring	DATE	from narrow - ness of outlook , and ignorance of the larger 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	currents of History .


Thomas Ritchie	PERSON	, of Scotch descent , but through his mother con - nected with powerful
Virginia	LOCATION	families , was born at
Tappahannock	LOCATION	in the
Old Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, on
November 5 , 1778	DATE	.

		After some legal edu - cation , some dabbling in Medicine , and some experience in teaching ,
Ritchie	PERSON	moved to Rich - mond in
1803	DATE	, and the next year was selected under the patronage of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	to edit the `` Richmond Enquirer , '' newly estab - lished to present the true gospel of Repub - licanism in opposition to the Federalist `` Gazette . ''

		Ritchie died in
1854	DATE	.

		Thus for almost exactly a half a century did he con - tinue a clearly marked career as a journalist , a career in which he made himself a type , or one may say , the type of the ante-bellum Southern editor .

		In one great respect , he stood above the type .

		Most of the editorial profession used their position as a means to the attainment of political office :
Ritchie	PERSON	always declined political preferment .

		Yet his biography is properly called : `` A Study in
Virginia	LOCATION	Politics , '' for
Ritchie	PERSON	, as Professor
Ambler	PERSON	shows , dominated the political thought of his party in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and through his paper and his personal activities , expressed the wider influence of
Virginia	LOCATION	upon the
Democratic Party	ORGANIZATION	in the South .

		Professor
Ambler	PERSON	's work is not free from faults of exe - cution .

		In the earlier part of the book espe - cially the effect upon the reader is rather ammlistic .

		One has rather too much the im - pression that
Ritchie	PERSON	's editorials have been strung together .

		There is a lack of unity and sequence .

		But as the work develops and as Professor
Ambler	PERSON	makes increasing use of other sources than the `` Enquirer , '' especially the manuscript collections in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the treatment of the subject becomes more satisfactory .

		Throughout the book , un - fortunately , the presswork is bad and mis - prints abound ; and there are mannerisms of style such as the grating repetition of ' ' True ' ' as a syncopated clause in the sentence .

		But neither faults in the organization of materials , misprints , nor stylistic idiosyncrasies seriously mar the value of the book .

		For it gives , per - haps , the best insight into the ramifications of
Virginia	LOCATION	politics , from the time of Ran - dolph ,
Marshall	PERSON	, and
Roane	PERSON	, to the time of
Rives	LOCATION	,
Tyler	PERSON	,
Upshur	LOCATION	,
R. M. T. Hunter	PERSON	, and
Stevenson	PERSON	, that is now available .

		More than this , the author follows
Ritchie	PERSON	from his ser - vice in
Virginia	LOCATION	to his service in
Washing	LOCATION	- ton , where in
1845	DATE	Ritchie undertook the editorship of the `` Union '' then founded by the Democratic organization to support the administration of
James K. Polk	PERSON	.

		The re - lation of this appointment to the preceding election of
1844	DATE	and to the difficulties which crowded Folk 's term of office , and the rea - sons for
Ritchie	PERSON	's comparative lack of suc - cess in the stormy years that followed until his retirement in
1851	DATE	, form the closing topics of Professor
Ambler	PERSON	's work ; and the interest which attaches to these pages only serves to make one question if some space might not have been saved in the earlier part of the book for the fuller treatment of this later period .

		The work includes a few well-chosen illustrations , a genealogical appendix and an index , while in the preface the author indi - cates the chief sources which he has used .

		Mr.
A. E. Gallatin	PERSON	is one of JXSS & 2 .

		those wealthy young amateurs who deserve well of the collect - ing fraternity because , in printing slender monographs on artistic subjects -LRB- presumably at their own expense -RRB- , they patronize The Merrymount Press and thus , whatever else they do , they at least put into circulation -LRB- strictly limited -RRB- exquisite specimens of typo - graphical art worthy to enrich any case or cabinet .

		We will not go so far as to say that their physical appearance constitutes the sole claim of Mr.
Gallatin	PERSON	's two brochures , ' ' Whist - ler 's Pastels and Other Modern Profiles '' and `` The Portraits and Caricatures of
James McNeill	PERSON	Whistler '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	-RRB- , on the con - noisseur 's attention , or gains for them a ready and even warm welcome that they could not hope to receive on any other ground .

		For , obviously , in the former , at least , the author has satisfactorily performed a useful if minor task , and his purely ieonographical comments are in a good tone and competent .

		But cer - tainly it can not be denied that , in that part of his work which at all pretends to criticism , the substance is very slight indeed .

		If it is possible to conceive of siich a distinction , Mr.
Gallatin	PERSON	may be called the `` master of the critical cliche . ''

		His style , such as it is , is almost wholly compact of the commonplace characterization , the trite turn of expression , the conventional phrase .

		And even for these he does not always stand sponsor but , with excess of caution , carefully introduces them between marks of quotation , as if to avoid any possible implication of rashness in the expres - sion of such extreme views !

		Here , better than any further criticism or analysis of this style of Mr.
Gallatin	PERSON	's , is an admirably illustrative example of the author 's magisterial yet minc - ing manner .

		The subject is
Whistler	LOCATION	's Vene - tian pastels .

		They , says Mr.
Gallatin	PERSON	, `` were an entirely new note in art : as in all the other various media he worked in , he not only mas - tered it , but developed its possibilities as well .

		Dr.
Bode	PERSON	speaks of ` the neatness of execution and the beauty of coloring ' of the great Ver -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 81 Indian lore for western readers .

		meer , and how aptly these words -LSB- remarkable words I -RSB- could be employed in describing
Whistler	LOCATION	's pastels of
Venice	LOCATION	!

		... His sub - jects were always unhackneyed and treated in an entirely personal way .

		These pastels , with their amazing technique , the lines are broken , as in the Venetian etchings , possess that ' impress of a personal quality , ' as
Walter Pater	PERSON	said of
Luca della Robbia	LOCATION	, ' a profound expressiveness , what the French call intimite , by which is meant some subtler sense of orig - inality the seal on a man 's work of what is most inward and peculiar in his moods and manner of apprehension . '

		The studies in black chalk which
Whistler	LOCATION	made of Venetian pal - aces , ... contain as well as the pastels the ' impress of a personal quality . ' '

		By which we may infer , in the manner of a well-known humorist of the moment , that Mr.
Gallatin	PERSON	regards
Whistler	LOCATION	's work as both original and exhibiting personality , only he does n't quite like to say so right out !

		And yet let us com - pliment the honesty of the writer whose con - science still requires him to refer back to Pater , -LRB- chapter , page , and paragraph almost -RRB- , notions that have so long since become the common property of touch-and-go asstheticians .

		A few months ago we spoke briefly of the writings of Miss
Margaret E. Noble	PERSON	, a gifted Irishwoman , who became a convert of the
Swaoni Vivekananda	PERSON	and devoted the last years of her life to the task of winning occi - dental readers to a sympathetic appreciation of
Hinduism	LOCATION	.

		As a part of her work she had planned a volume that should give in con - densed form much of the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	and Mahabarata and should also contain brief ac - counts of
Krishna	LOCATION	,
Shiva	ORGANIZATION	, and
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the time of her death only about a third of the book had been written , and its completion was entrusted to
Ananda K. Ooomaraswamy	PERSON	.

		The outcome of their labors is now presented in `` Myths of the Hindus and Buddhists '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- , a generous volume of four hundred pages , in which are retold `` almost all the tales commonly illustrated in Indian sculpture and painting . ''

		Of course the book is writ - ten for the general reader and not for the special student ; but if it is judged on the basis of its own modest aims it may be said to fulfil its purpose laudably .

		Naturally , one must differ very often from the frankly advocatory estimate of the authors .

		For in - stance , we can not quite acquiesce in the state - ment that the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	is `` surely the best tale of chivalry and truth and love of crea - tures that was ever w r ritten '' ; nor is it easy to enjoy and praise many features that would seem perfectly natural and beautiful to a mind A book of prisons and prisoners .

		that has developed under Hindu influence .

		At the same time the effort to attain an alien point of view is always useful ; and from this work one may gather not a little knowledge of
India	LOCATION	's culture and religion .

		Perhaps the most striking feature of the volume is to be found in the illustrations by Indian artists working under the supervision of
Abanindro Nath Tagore	PERSON	, C.I.E. All of them are sig - nificant ; a few of them , remarkable .

		To the reviewer the pictures of `` Buddha as a Men - dicant '' and `` The Final Release '' were par - ticularly attractive , although a critic more thoroughly versed in Indian art might prefer some of the more recondite subjects .

		The material volume is pleasing throughout .

		Prisons and prison customs of the past , criminals and their ways , the desperate game that the felon plays against the constituted author - ities of law and order , the triumphs of de - tective skill , the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition , the butcheries of the Reign of Terror , the history of
Botany Bay	LOCATION	, the rela - tion between crime and superstition these and kindred themes are treated with an abun - dance of illustrative anecdote by Mr.
Tighe Hopkins	PERSON	in `` The Romance of Fraud '' -LRB- But - ton -RRB- .

		In the sixteen chapters of the book none is more readable than that describing some of the time-killing devices of the incar - cerated ; and among these interesting mention is made of some more or less notable works of literature produced in prison .

		The Abbe
Lenglet Dufresnoy	PERSON	, who had made seven or eight involuntary visits to various State pris - ons , declared them `` the best places in the world to work in . ' '

		Whenever he was arrested he gave the summoning officer a cordial recep - tion , asking only for time to pack his linen , books , and manuscripts , after which he would send a note to his publisher : `` You will have the book I am engaged on in a very short time now , for , under His Majesty 's good pleasure , I am just being conducted to my study . ''

		Mr.
Hopkins	PERSON	devotes a chapter to the escape of Colonel Rose and his companions from
Libby Prison	ORGANIZATION	, a tale more fully told by American chroniclers , but not out of place as an in - stance of justifiable fraud on the prisoners ' part .

		The attractions A feW 7 ^ ^ a the Dutch EaSt of
Java	LOCATION	and its Indies were considered well off adjacent islands .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Qf ^ ^ ^ trotter , and it was thought something of an adventure to run down from
Singapore	LOCATION	and spend a few weeks in the land of the sarong and the kris .

		But then the Dutch colonial government awoke to the possibilities of tour - ist travel , information offices were opened , 82 THE DIAL
August 1	DATE	attractive pamphlets in English were circu - lated , until to-day Americans swinging around the world generally plan to spend at least a fortnight in
Java	LOCATION	although they may pass by the equally attractive
Philippines	LOCATION	without a thought .

		Mr.
Arthur S. Walcott	PERSON	has written an account of his fifteen weeks of travel in ''
Java	LOCATION	and Her Neighbours '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The book is designed primarily for the use of ' ' the ever-increasing army of travellers '' and they may read for themselves how easy it is to travel in
Java	LOCATION	, how attractive are the hotels , how comfortable the railways , and how smooth the roads .

		And then when they would explore the ports of the `` Outer Possessions '' they may have recourse to the trim little ships of the
Koninklijke Paketvaart Maatschappij	ORGANIZATION	, which , being interpreted , is the
Royal Mail Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Walcott	PERSON	visited practically all the show places of
Java	LOCATION	, including the botan - ical gardens , the native principalities , the Buddhist ruins , and the accessible craters .

		He cruised through the eastern islands , touching at
Bali	LOCATION	,
Celebes	LOCATION	,
Borneo	LOCATION	,
Ternate	LOCATION	, Bat j an ,
Amboyna	LOCATION	,
Banda	PERSON	, and others .

		And he finally visited the ports of
West Sumatra	LOCATION	and the beautiful
Padang Highlands	LOCATION	.

		But at no place did he attempt the unusual , or anything that the ordinary pleasure-seeking traveller might not easily do . ' '

		I know of no regions of more lovely and more varied scenery , '' he tells us , `` and of no lands where so much that is strange and unusual may be seen at so little risk and with so little discomfort . ' '

		His book is the most helpful account of present travel - conditions in
Java	LOCATION	and the adjacent islands that is available in English , and the illustra - tions are exceptionally good .

		A. naturalist in the wild
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		A love of literature and a love of nature have combined to make Professor
Dallas	LOCATION	Lore Sharp one of the comparatively few natural - ists who can write natural-history books that are also works of literature of a high order .

		His latest volume , `` Where Rolls the
Oregon	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , contains eleven narrative chap - ters -LRB- not all new to his readers , but all well worthy of preservation in book form -RRB- of per - sonal experience amid the wild life and the snow-capped mountains of our great North - west .

		Younger readers may perhaps search the map in vain for the mighty stream that gives its name to the book , but that has for a good many years been known as the
Columbia River	LOCATION	.

		The change from the name immor - talized in poetry is to be regretted .

		Sea-birds and sea-lions , the raven of the
Deschutes Canon	ORGANIZATION	, a motor-car journey through the sage brush , the fugitive life of the desert , the nearly-exterminated white heron of the marshes , an ascent of
Mount Hood	ORGANIZATION	and the swarm of butterflies discovered at play about its summit , the cony and its rocky haunts , the mother instinct in birds and animals , and , finally , a closing word on the splendid mate - rial resources of vigorous young
Oregon	LOCATION	such , in brief , are the contents of this suffi - ciently varied and at the same time not ununified collection of studies and sketches picturing some of the things seen and heard and enjoyed in a
summer	DATE	's outing on or near the rolling
Oregon	LOCATION	.

		But our hasty summary has omitted the most thrilling chapter of the book , a description of the marvellous rescue of a vast herd of cattle that had stampeded in the
night	TIME	on the brink of a precipice , and that only the superhuman intelligence of
Peroxide Jim	PERSON	, a horse of wonderful speed and pluck and initiative , saved from self-destruc - tion .

		`` The Spirit of the Herd '' is the name of the story a true one , we doubt not and it reveals a considerable knowledge of cowboy life on the writer 's part .

		At the other end of his scale of accomplishments , he gives us , in - cidentally , an original translation from the Hebrew of a passage in
Isaiah	LOCATION	.

August 1,1914	DATE	-LRB- From a Review in the `` Minneapolis Journal '' -RRB- Lincoln as He Was The
Everyday Life of Abraham Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	.


Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Publishers	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		THE material for this work , which was originally published
thirty years ago	DATE	, was collected from more than five hundred of the friends and contemporaries of
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		So much has been written on the subject during the last generation that any new issue in the field owes an apology for its existence .

		The manner in which the present volume was prepared constitutes a more than sufficient apology .

		Here an attempt has been made to present Lincoln , the man , rather than
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the tradition ; and the result might be characterized as an anecdotal life . ''

		It can not be doubted that the traditional Lincoln , as usually presented to school children , and which has become fixed in the mind of the average adult , is a rather highly sentimentalized concept .

		All the tremendous and tragic circum - stances surrounding the man were admirably suited to act as a distorting medium .

		A long and exhausting war is conducive to popular hysteria , as a result of which even the most level-headed men are likely to overstate ; and the tragic death would tend to stifle the colder , more detached criticism .

		Added to these circumstances was the powerful appeal to humanitarian idealism involved in the emancipation of slaves . ''

		In the greater number of writings on Lincoln , one can not but note an almost total lack of the sober critical faculty .

		All witnesses seem to have vied with each other in exaltation .

		Nearly all testimony has a suspicious note of emotional abandon in it .

		It will probably never be possible entirely to separate the tradi - tional from the factual ; but that critical-minded historian of the future who shall write the fairest possible appraisal of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's character shall be obliged to make use of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's volume ; and therein lies its chief value as a source .

		Nor need any American patriot fear the result of that colder criticism which is inevitable .

		The present volume , in which
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is much less of a sad demi-god ` than in the conventional representations , shows how much greater a man may be in fact than in sentimental tradition . ''

		Here is shown plainly , what has never been a secret and yet is persistently ignored , that
Lincoln	PERSON	held out as long as possible against those who urged the abolition of slavery , issuing his proclamation only as a last desperate means of subduing the South .

		It was the master-stroke of a wise opportunist rather than the exalted deed of a humanitarian .

		And yet millions of children have been led to believe that the war was primarily a war against the institution of slavery , and that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's chief concern was with the freeing of slaves .

		Truly , he was opposed to slavery , but he constantly placed the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	above abolition , believing that the latter should be accomplished by a slow process of purchase and colonization .

		That he thus proved his far-sightedness is apparent now when the negro question has become an issue of grave importance .

		There is much in the evidence here presented to indicate that , had he lived through the Reconstruction period , the negro would have been dealt with in a much more prac - tical way than that of the high-handed ultra-humanitarians who insisted upon regarding the negro as an Anglo-Saxon with a black skin . ''

		Furthermore , we here see Lincoln as a possible human being , capable of losing patience , capable of petulance and anger , capable of making mistakes .

		And inasmuch as he is made to appear more the man and less the demi-god , by so much he looms the bigger and is the more intelligible to men . ''

		SHERMAN ST THE LAST SHOT BY
FREDERICK PALMER	PERSON	In this
Time of War	ORGANIZATION	, this Novel is a Book of Immediate Importance A RECENT EDITORIAL IN
HARPER	PERSON	'S WEEKLY SAYS : '' ' The Last Shot ' appears at the psychological moment .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	probably knows more about actual war than any other novelist now writing , and very likely more than any other war correspondent now writing .

		Any general reader who goes through this story will have a much more filled-out picture of what a great modern war would mean than he could have had before .

		A notable quality in Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	is that his intimate knowledge of war has not made him romantic about it , but rather the reverse ; and the terrible , machine-like butchery of modern methods is frightfully distinct .

		... As an immediate and useful document , it stands high , and the greater its cir - culation the better for the formation of well-founded opinion about the meaning of war . ''

		We have been reading lately a book on the new German literature by
Percival Pollard	PERSON	, a meteor of American criticism , who dazzled and died a few years ago .

		It has something of the mingled vitriol and honey , irony and enthusiasm which makes
Heine	PERSON	's `` Romantic School '' good reading after the lapse of three-quarters of a century .

		Like much re - cent criticism of note
Pollard	PERSON	's work is im - pressionistic and it deals with the near and the new .

		`` What is that plant ? ''

		an artist was asked , of some nondescript growth in his picture .

		`` That is the foreground plant , '' he replied .

		`` I use a great deal of it . ''

		So does the new school of critics .

		Values and dis - tance and aerial perspective may go hang for all they care .

		They fight shoulder to shoulder with the artists and writers who are forcing their way to the front , and perhaps their narrowness is a necessity .

		A phalanx has to be narrow to make any impression on ` the opposing ranks .

		Besides the lack of a sense of proportion which
Pollard	ORGANIZATION	shares with most impression - istic critics , he has obliquities of outlook of his own .

		It is well enough for a critic to have certain objects or persons of dislike .

		It makes for lively writing .

		But the unprejudiced reader has a right to allow for such imperfect sympathies .

		Brahmins , we suppose , have bowels ; American millionaires are , at least , vertebrate animals ; and it is not actually a penitentiary offence to indite a `` best seller . ''

		These are red rags , however , which excite Pol - lard to fury .

		1 1 is worst offence against the critical spirit is his belief that the literature he has in view is new and strange ; that its excesses are more excessive , its abnormalities more abnormal than have been known before .

		All literature is a study of abnormalities , which is only to say that it is a study of human nature .

		The absolutely sane , normal , standard human being is a myth .

		The derelictions of one per - son are to the right hand , the derelictions of another to the left .

		The enthusiasms of one seem insanities to another .

		`` Everybody is queer but thee and me , '' said the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	to his wife , ' ' and I am not sure that thee is quite - 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	right . ' '

		To anyone who is versed in the Revo - lutionary literature of a hundred years ago the work of
Bierbaum	LOCATION	,
Wedekind	PERSON	, and
Schnitz	PERSON	- ler , and their English and French contempo - raries , will seem but a minor eruption of the earthquake spirit .

		There has been , or is , however , a period of expansion , of explosion .

		The sun has its cycle when it cools and contracts in compara - tive peace , and then it has its cycle of sun spots , and so with literature .

		The long cool - ing period of the eighteenth century was followed by the tremendous outburst which preceded and followed the French Revolution .

		The shorter era which we denominate the Victorian Age has been broken up by lesser upheavals of the same sort , marked by the appearance of such writers as Zola , De Mau - passant ,
Verlaine	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	,
D'Annunzio	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	,
Wells	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, and the German writers we have named .

		It does not follow that the writers who best express the spirit of their age , whether that be one of contraction or expansion , are necessarily the best .

		Down through the ages goes a golden line of pure artists , who deal with the permanent elements of human nature and work with the enduring colors of art .

		Gray ,
Collins	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, even Goethe ,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	in their best work , are beyond or above the spirit of any age .

		The Greeks had their Dionysian myth with its recurring festivals ; the Romans had their
Saturnalia	LOCATION	; the Middle Ages had their Lords of Misrule .

		Apparently humanity must at intervals either let off steam , or go mad .

		En - glish and German literature have been letting off steam at a great rate during the last twenty-five years .

		Nietzsche has been the philosopher of the period .

		In most things he was the pupil of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, but he had a more glancing and pungent way of putting ideas .

		Of course there is practically nothing new in his thought .

		There is enough revolutionary stuff in
Emer	PERSON	- son to make a
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, but it was negatived and made innocuous by the conservatism and optimistic idealism in which it was wrapped up .

		Carry le preached the doctrine of the Superman though he did not use the word which really belongs to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nietzsche revolted from
Wagner	PERSON	because of two things : the latter 's trend toward relig - ion , even sacerdotalism , and his attitude toward woman .

		Women in
Wagner	PERSON	always save the situation .

		They are the inspirers and regenerators of man .

		To Nietzsche , follow - ing
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, they were little better than animals .

		`` When you go among women , do not forget the whip , '' he said .

		In most mod - ern German poets and playwrights , and in a good many recent English novelists , there is an almost total abandonment of the angel theory of womanhood .

		We know from Tacitus that this fine respect for woman was a basic principle of Teutonic life .

		We know from the old Irish poems and Welsh legends that it was a dominant feeling in the Celtic race .

		It was the principle of Chivalry , and reinforced by the idealism of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	has been implicit in all the higher literature of En - gland and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Even Goethe , after Burns the most naturalistic as well as amo - rous of poets , holds a brief for the `` Ever - womanly that leads us on . ''

		The new writers , whether in prose or verse , will have none of this .

		They are just as frankly appreciative of the physical charms of woman as the old ones , but they do not look to her for light and leading .

		They are willing that woman should be as immoral as man , provided she gives him pleasure .

		As far as the making of literature is concerned , this theory is just as good as the other one .

		It is the theory of the whole East , it is largely the theory of an - tiquity .

		Poetry is always saved by sensuous - ness ; it is always damned by didacticism .

		In the point of view of life , however , the chiv - alric theory certainly seems the better one .

		Women may object , as many of them are doing to-day , to be set apart for goodness , to be elected as the elevators of man .

		But the horrible examples of their fate in the other direction which crowd the plays of modern
Germany	LOCATION	and the novels of modern
England	LOCATION	, would seem to indicate that they had better keep their place as goddesses if they possibly can .

		The turning away from religion and sacer - dotalism which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	voiced had more rea - son in it .

		The formalism of the churches had hardened into hypocrisy .

		The humiliations , the prostrations , the scourgings of the flesh which they inculcated weakened man 's soul and body when they were practiced in reality ; and when they were a mere pretence made his life a living lie .

		Better the frankest ani - malism , the most ruthless trampling through the world , than this loss of initiative , this cloaked appearance .

		Of course the Super -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 93 man is no new apparition in either life or literature .

		Napoleon only brings up the rear of a long line of conscienceless conquerors , and the
Don Juans	PERSON	,
Karl Moors	PERSON	,
Manfreds	PERSON	, and
Marmions	PERSON	are scattered over literature .

		But when there is a democratic outbreak into this field of human effort , when it becomes universal to be without religion or restraint , the thing is simpty impossible .

		The Super - man of the suburbs , the Demogorgon of the department shop are ridiculous figures .

		And man is a thing of form and fear .

		His life is short ; the night is near ; and if his need to worship something did not constrain him , his dread of the future would force him on his knees .

		Accordingly right 011 the heels of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, the herald of chaos , comes Eucken , with his vitalistic mysticism and his preach - ing of redemption , and
Bergson	PERSON	with his at - tempt to rear again the banners of Metaphysic which Science had banished to the rear .


Berg	PERSON	- son 's system is a strong effort for synthesis after destructive analysis had done its worst ; .

		it is a struggle to know in the region where Science had said there was nothing knowable .

		But at bottom it is as material as the Science which it tries to displace or supplement .

		If there is nothing but Becoming ; if the stream of existence , '' which runs , and as it runs , forever must run on , - '' is all ; if there is no Being to act and be acted upon by this flux of things ; if human life be only a series of unconnected moments ; then immortality is a dream , and morality a matter of little moment .

		Woman 's rights , Socialism , the uplift of the masses , questions of education , all those matters furnish material for contemporary European literature .

		And they are all lega - cies from the French Revolution or some re - moter day .

		It is as if humanity had only marked time in the interval , and had now suddenly started to keep step to the music of the past .

		The woman propaganda has hardly yet caught up to the programme set forth by
Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin	PERSON	.


Tom Paine	PERSON	,
Godwin	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, are still in advance of our most recent radicals .

		The community idea of property ownership has been promul - gated again and again .

		The discussion of all these things keeps the world from stagnat - ing , perhaps keeps oppression from becoming too bitter .

		Most of them will sooner or later be put into practice .

		But we doubt if any millennium will result , or any appreciable change in human conditions .

		We rather smiled in the beginning of this article at
Pollard	ORGANIZATION	's pet prejudices ; but in - deed we consider that his polemic against the spinelessness , the timidity , the insipidity of American literature , is the best part of his book .

		Mediocrity is written large over most of our contemporary work .

		We drive our artists in color and line abroad , and they , breathing the free intellectual air of
Europe	LOCATION	, develop until they loom large in the eyes of the world .

		But we condemn our stay-at-home men of letters to live in an atmosphere of dull provinciality which asphyxiates them .

		It is not that we do not know what is being thought in the larger world .

		We do not stop European ideas at our custom-houses , but we impose an internal tax on American thinkers and artists which crushes them into silence .

		The most advanced or outre European works are accepted with complacency by our readers or playgoers , but any approach to sensuous - ness by a native poet , any discussion of under - lying problems of life by a home thinker , any questionings as to the providential arrange - ment which imposes the Morgans and
Rocke	PERSON	- fellers on us by a compatriot economist , are frowned down upon , and in fact can not get themselves printed .

		Like the Queen of
Spain	LOCATION	the American woman has no legs , and our lords of finance control too many publications and churches and professional parasites to have their doings questioned .

		Meanwhile vul - garity and triviality and utter literary rot are rampant .

		The people who purvey this stuff get rich and the
State	ORGANIZATION	rewards with Ambassadorships and high office the dealers in prose and verse twaddle or provincial plati - tudes .

		We had better let loose Lords of Mis - rule , like those who are working in
Europe	LOCATION	to-day , rather than rest in this mediocrity .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		LAW AND LITERATURE have their mutual affinities as well as their mutual antagonisms .

		Though as a rule our practising lawyers enter - tain a more or less unconscious contempt for '' mere literature , '' there are noteworthy ex - ceptions jurists who brave the derision of their professional brethren by cultivating the muse in their spare hours .

		An eminent
New York	LOCATION	lawyer -LRB- his name will be found below -RRB- , who has committed the indiscretion of writ - ing some excellent magazine articles , now has to submit to the jocosely ironical greeting from 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	a brother lawyer of distinction , `` Well , how is the poet to-day ? ''

		And another , who once delivered an address on the author of `` Brahma , '' is referred to , with similar tire - some persistence , as `` the Emersonian law - yer . ''

		Literature 's debt to men of legal training is too considerable for more than the briefest passing mention here .


Walter Scott	PERSON	's name alone is enough to prove that the study of
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	need not dry up the springs of poetry and romance .

		Indeed ,
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	him - self is not without felicities of style .

		Lincoln , a lawyer of distinction long before he wrote his
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address , is now recognized as a master of pure and vigorous and at the same time graceful English .

		Choate and
Webster	PERSON	are still read with enjoyment .

		One of the notable books of the present season , a book that no intelligent reader can fail to find in - teresting , is from the pen of a lawyer , Mr.
Theron G. Strong	PERSON	's `` Landmarks of a Law - yer 's Lifetime . ''

		Another
New York	LOCATION	lawyer , Mr.
Joseph S. Auerbach	PERSON	, has just given us , in two scholarly volumes , a collection of his `` Essays and Miscellanies , '' wherein , both by example and precept , he renders noble service to the cause of careful and correct English .

		He is a college graduate of the old school , the school that knew not vocational training and bread-and-butter studies , the school that took its teachings in sentence-construction and the logical presentation of thought from the Greek and Latin classics .

		From this apostle of cul - ture let us quote , in closing , a few words on style : `` Great thoughts and great emotions find their true interpretation , and are made manifest in the infinite variety of the style of illustrious , creative minds , as the several strings of a musical instrument are waked to harmony by the touch of the master .

		Style is not something separate and apart from the printed word , any more than in the concep - tion of the devout worshipper , is God Himself a being outside of and aloof from the throb - bing life of His universe ; style is not mere ornamentation and adornment of the uttered thought , but its very soul .

		And it finds elo - quent and persuasive voice , only when , as though within a great temple , men consecrate themselves to the spirit of culture . ' '

		WHY WE HAVE NO HIGH COMEDY , like
Sheri	PERSON	- dan 's `` The Rivals '' and `` The School for Scandal , '' and
Goldsmith	PERSON	's `` She Stoops to Conquer , '' and many more of that old order which every veteran play-goer cherishes in fond remembrance , is explained by Mr.
Clay	PERSON	- ton
Hamilton	PERSON	in a preface to Sir
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	's `` Mary Goes First , '' lately published in the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	series .

		He says : `` High comedy requires for its inspira - tion a social tradition that has been handed down for centuries .

		It has frequently been said that it takes three generations to make a gentleman ; but it takes more than three to develop a comedy of manners .

		Manners do not become a theme for satire until they have been crystallized into a code ; and , to laugh politely , a playwright must have an aristoc - racy to laugh at .

		The spirit of our people is inexorably opposed to the very idea of an aristocracy of birth ; we can not have an aris - tocracy of wealth , since the phrase itself pre - sents an irresoluble contradiction in terms ; and we have hardly yet had time to develop an aristocracy of culture .

		To all intents and purposes , the
United States	LOCATION	is still a country without an upper class , and the chaos of our social system precludes the possibility of social satire in our native drama .

		As
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	has pithily remarked , mast of our American comedies must be classed as comedies of bad manners .

		We laugh uproari - ously at impoliteness on our stage , because we have not yet learned to laugh delicately at politeness .

		We are amused at the eccentrici - ties of bad behavior , because we have not yet learned to be amused at the eccentricities of good behavior .

		High comedy is the last of .

		all dramatic types to be established in the art of any nation , and until we have had time to develop a native comedy of manners we must content ourselves with an appreciation of the social satires of our somewhat older cousins overseas .

		In this particular domain of art
America	LOCATION	is still a province of
Great Britain	LOCATION	. ' '

		Not an immediately hopeful outlook for high comedy in
America	LOCATION	; but as all things are pos - sible to genius , it may be that some brilliant native playwright will arise to refute the logic of Mr.
Clayton Hamilton	PERSON	.

		FRENCHWOMEN WHO WRITE FOR A LIVELI - HOOD do not yet equal in number their pro- fessional sisters in
England	LOCATION	or in this country , but they are increasing , and their work com - monly has a style and finish not so often attained by the English or the American woman writer .

		In journalism , as the
London	LOCATION	`` Times ''
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent remarks , the women are making their influence felt more and more in
France	LOCATION	; and one significant evi - dence that they take themselves seriously , and are taken seriously by others , in this work , is the fact that no woman writer for the French press is ever called a journaliste a term that would be deemed little short of defama - tory to her but she enjoys the distinction of being known as a femme de lettres or a collaboratrice .

		The subjects that a woman writer can handle better than a man are numerous , and she no longer shows herself
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 95 bashful about treating of those that prop - erly fall within man 's domain .

		Some of the prominent women journalists , or `` women of letters , '' mentioned by the `` Times '' writer are
Madame Brisson	PERSON	, editor -LRB- or , if the less emancipated prefer it , editress -RRB- of `` Les Annales , ' ' known for her work in aid of girls ' education ,
Madame de Broutelles	PERSON	, at the head of `` La Vie Heureuse '' and `` La Mode Pra - tique , '' famous for her successful efforts to secure the dowering of a certain number of poor girls every year , and
Mademoiselle Val	ORGANIZATION	- entine
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, who conducts `` La Vie Femi - nine , '' a journal that bids fair to accomplish notable results in the field of women 's work , especially in those departments having to do with hygiene and philanthropy .

		Other women journalists of
Paris	LOCATION	might be named who , as leader-w r riters , stand on an equal footing with men and receive the same material recognition of their ability .

		It may indeed be not far from the truth that , as one of these writing Frenchwomen expresses it , `` en
France	LOCATION	la femme est presque omnipotente . ''

		The
Cail	ORGANIZATION	- laux-Calmette incident certainly reveals mo - mentous possibilities , not to say actualities , as to the Frenchwoman 's influence in affairs of some importance .

		PRIMITIVE COLLEGE CUSTOMS , as occasionally referred to in time-stained letters or early memoirs , not seldom show an uncouthness and rudeness that encourage one to believe that the academic world really does move in the direction of better things .

		The recent publication of some century-old letters of Dr.
Nathan Smith	PERSON	, founder of the medical schools at
Dartmouth	LOCATION	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Bowdoin	LOCATION	, and the
University of Vermont	ORGANIZATION	, reveals some curious fashions in student pranks a hundred years ago .

		Writing in
1814	DATE	from
New Haven	LOCATION	, where he had two sons at college , to his wife at Han - over , he says : ' ' We have lately had some diffi - culty in the School between the cooks and the scholars .

		Then , as now , there was safety in numbers where breaches of discipline were concerned .

		While quoting from this curiously interesting collection of letters , one is tempted to give a sample of the love-letters of that time by reproducing
Nathan Smith	PERSON	's written proposal of marriage to the daughter of General
Jonathan Chase	PERSON	, of
Cornish	LOCATION	, N. H .

		The letter is dated at
Cornish	LOCATION	,
January 22 , 1794	DATE	, and runs , without preliminary endear - ments , thus : `` Sally : You will excuse the precipitancy with which I proceed in my en - deavors to accomplish my connection with you .

		I expected last evening to have set off for

		It is reasonable to infer that the charming
Sally	PERSON	had already shown herself favorable to the ardent
Nathan	PERSON	's suit .

		THE SACRIFICE OF A NEAT BIT OF IMAGERY is one of the unavoidable consequences -LRB- ruth - lessly disregarded by those responsible -RRB- of the digging of the
Cape Cod Canal	ORGANIZATION	, which was opened with appropriate ceremonies
July 29	DATE	.

		That gaping stretch of water , which now makes
Cape Cod	ORGANIZATION	an island , does irreparable damage to the third paragraph of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's book named from the sandy pe ` ninsula tra - versed by him three times and then made the subject of a memorable work from his pen .

		The paragraph reads thus : ' '
Cape Cod	LOCATION	is the bared and bended arm of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	: the shoulder is at
Buzzard	ORGANIZATION	's Bay ; the elbow , or crazy-bone , at
Cape Mallebarre	LOCATION	; the wrist at
Truro	LOCATION	; and the sandy fist at
Provincetown	LOCATION	, behind which the
State	ORGANIZATION	stands on her guard , with her back to the
Green Mountains	ORGANIZATION	, and her feet planted on the floor of the ocean , like an athlete protecting her Bay , boxing with northeast storms , and , ever and anon , heaving up her
Atlantic	LOCATION	adversary from the lap of earth , ready to thrust forward her other fist , which keeps guard the while upon her breast at
Cape Ann	LOCATION	. ''

		What might will there henceforth be in that `` bared and bended arm '' now that it is severed at the shoulder , and what protection can that ' ' sandy fist '' afford to the bay it has so long guarded , now that the enemy is free to steal in behind that fist in the outrageous fashion made both possible and - easy by those who have so cruelly amputated the arm ?

		However , there may be a grain of comfort , of a utilitarian sort , in the reflection that what is poetry 's loss is com - merce 's gain ; and we still have , and are likely to retain , the consolation of the unimpaired pugilistic capabilities of that `` other fist '' at

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		GROCER-SHOP CRITICISM AND REAL CRITICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have followed with some interest the discussion of '' Literary Criticism in American Periodicals '' begun by Professor
Bliss Perry	PERSON	in the '' Yale Re - view '' and continued in a leading article on '' Grocer-shop Criticism '' in a recent issue of THE DIAL .

		Professor
Perry	PERSON	brings a heavy indictment against periodical criticism in
America	LOCATION	; but after reading his censure and your comment , I find it easier than before to explain why criticism has with us risen to no higher levels .

		For while in a country which is , in the realm of ideas , one of the most conservative in the world , it is neither new nor surprising to find even so authoritative an organ of opinion as your own thrown into a panic when brought face to face with a new idea , still it is surprising if not new to find THE DIAL accept from , the pen of a distinguished scholar in our oldest university the theory that the processes of
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 97 literary criticism are the same as those which the grocer employs in weighing his commodities .

		Possibly it may be absurd to argue when the cause is so hopeless ; but surely it must have occurred to you that the grocer 's scales measure weight while the literary critic is concerned with quality , a thing not so easy to compute , even for grocers .

		Surely it must have occurred to you that while the weights and measures of a grocer are possible of minute ascertainment and universal acceptance , measures of criticism can never be stated with the same precision , or even if so stated , can never be certain of universal intelligence , not to mention universal acceptance .

		Pounds and bushels may be readily converted into kilograms all the world over , and may serve to weigh or measure Irish potatoes , Spanish olives , Arabian dates , and Chinese ginger ; but I challenge THE DIAL to state its literary standards with such pre - cision as will make them applicable alike to the literary output of
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Arabia	LOCATION	, and
China	LOCATION	.

		Surely it must have occurred to you that while the grocer should aim at an external and mechanical standard wholly outside of the things which he measures , the mechanical and external are exactly what artistic standards should seek to avoid .

		Surely it must have occurred to you that while a grocer can weigh turnips just as well even .

		if he hates and despises them , and need never have tasted one in his life , the critic , on the other hand , must be called to his profession by a love of books , and can never judge rightly without real sympathy .

		Surely it must have occurred to you but I stand appalled at the thought of all the things that should have occurred to you before you committed yourself to Professor
Perry	PERSON	's puerile metaphor of the grocer critic .

		The fact is -LRB- and it is so important that it must be stated clearly and frankly -RRB- that both you and he have a wholly vague and confused idea as to what criticism really means .

		I might pass lightly over the illustration from the grocer-shop , but one of the passages which you quote with approval from Professor
Perry	PERSON	's article is unmistakable .

		The real difficulty , he says , is that Americans are inter - ested in '' stock-market criticism , '' in '' baseball criticism , '' in '' political , social , and economic criti - cism , '' even in '' musical or dramatic criticism , '' but not in the '' criticism of books . ''

		Now , the first essential to any understanding of what criti - cism is , is to understand that the word when used in connection with '' baseball criticism '' or '' po - litical criticism '' has no more to do with the word '' criticism '' when applied to literature or other art , than a clothes-horse has to do with a real horse , or a geometrical circle with a literary circle , or a progressive euchre party with the
Progressive Party	ORGANIZATION	, or a firing line with a line of verse .

		I am afraid that the confusion is hopelessly entrenched in our thought , but it is the duty of journals like THE DIAL and of scholars like Professor
Perry	PERSON	to clarify such confusion and not to make it denser .

		I remember that a friend of mine , hearing of my intention to write a History of Literary Criticism , once suggested that I include in it a history of the critical spirit in all forms of intellectual activity , rather than merely a history of the criticism of books .

		The suggestion had an impressive sound , but it was no more valuable than a suggestion to include in a book on horses all the horsey things in the world , including race-track touts , horse - radish , clothes-horses , and hippopotamuses .

		An Italian scholar once attempted a task of this kind , and in the jumble of science , jurisprudence , eco - nomics , and '' critical '' philosophy , literary criti - cism is reduced to a sorry state .

		The criticism of literature is , first of all , a distinct and separate art , and involves the re-living in the critic 's mind of the work which he is criticizing ; it involves , that is to say , a re-creation of the artist 's work , before it rises above the work to become an act of judgment .

		It is only as a metaphor that this art may be said to have any connection whatever with the purely intellectual processes of '' political , social , or eco - nomic criticism . ''

		It is this confusion which viti - ates the criticism of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, from whom Professor
Perry	PERSON	tamely receives it ; and it is un - necessary to charge you with the same confusion , since you confess it yourself : '' that THE DIAL has upheld this view for upwards of thirty years is well known to our -LRB- your -RRB- readers . ''

		This charge , you will understand , involves neither the probity nor the value of your practice .

		That THE DIAL has never yielded to the shameless puffery and dishonesty characteristic of so much periodical writing about books is incontestable .

		It has always stated its honest opinions about them .

		But honesty of opinion is not criticism any more than honesty of character is statesmanship .

		It is true that in our political life corruption has been so blatant and pervasive that our present concern seems to be rather with honesty than with states - manship ; and it may be true that in our literary life our first concern now is with honest opinions rather than with creative criticism .

		If this is so , our periodicals are in the same stage of develop - ment as our politics ; but surely the day must come when honesty , alike in reviews and politics , will be taken for granted , and a search be made , not for honest writers or honest men , but for true critics and true statesmen .

		We shall prepare the way for that day when we clarify the concept of '' criticism '' and make it plain what criticism really is .

		There is one other confusion of thought which you share with Professor
Perry	PERSON	, and which I should like to use this opportunity of making clear .

		I do not intend to defend what you are pleased to call my `` foolish vaporings , '' but I think it only fair that you should permit me to clarify at least one point in my own doctrine which you apparently completely misapprehend .

		Your edi - torial , as I understand it , includes among other things a defence of critical judgment as an essen - tial element in the act of criticism , and you imply that in my lecture on '' The New Criticism '' I have thrown the idea of critical judgment to the winds , and invite the critic to enjoy without judging .

		Nothing could be clearer , however , than that this is not my point of view , and that I have insisted always that a critic must judge books as well as enjoy them .

		In my lecture I distinctly pointed out that the failure of modern impressionistic criticism consists in the very fact that it disre -
98	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	gards this element of critical judgment .

		I said then and I say now , that enjoyment and judgment always fall '' short of their highest powers unless mystically mated , judgment erecting its edicts into arbitrary standards and conventions , enjoy - ment lost in the mazes of its sensuous indecision . ''

		There is no conflict , then , between you and Pro- fessor
Perry	PERSON	on the one side and myself on the other , so far as the idea of judgment in criticism is concerned .

		We differ , however , in this , that you are willing to accept what I have called '' arbi - trary standards and conventions '' whenever they have come to us from the past , and I have made it the study of my life to find out exactly what these conventions are , and to point out in exactly what respect they are arbitrary and outworn .

		Among the instruments of criticism which I be - lieve to have been outworn in this way are the old empirical '' rules '' according to which classical criticism in a former age judged every work of art .

		A Latin poet like
Horace	PERSON	, brought face to face with a new play , would have said , '' This is a bad play because it disobeys the old rule that not more than three speakers shall be on the stage at any one time . ''

		A French classicist like
Boileau	PERSON	, brought into contact with a new play , would have said , '' This is a bad play because it disregards the old rule that the theme of every play shall not extend beyond twenty-four hours . ''

		An English reviewer like
Lord Jeffrey	PERSON	, brought into contact with a new poem , would have said , '' This is bad poetry because it disregards the old rule that an heroic couplet should come to a distinct close at the end of every two lines . ''

		And a Victorian American like Professor
Perry	PERSON	, brought into con - tact with a new work of art , would in similar manner say , '' This is a bad work of art because it disregards the rules which happened to be popular at the time when I received my academic education . ''

		If modern criticism has learned anything what - ever as the result of its self - searching during the last one hundred years , it has learned this : that arbitrary standards and rules have never deter - mined the merit of any work of art and never can determine its merit .

		So that looking about for a new and more vital method by which to test beau - tiful things , criticism has found it only in this the attempt , first , to discover what the artist him - self has tried to do , and then to judge his achieve - ment , not by any standards which the artist himself did not choose , but only by the goal which he himself set out to arrive at .

		We can no longer say to an artist , whether he be poet or painter : '' Your work is not good because it disregards standards set for you by other people . ''

		We can say to him , and we do say to him if we are really creative critics : '' You have attempted to do this or that , and what you yourself have tried to do you have apparently achieved , or failed in . ''

		Among the arbitrary standards and conventions which I believe to have dominated criticism too long , and which modern thought must eradicate from the whole field of critical thought and activ - ity , I indicated in my lecture on '' The New Criti - cism '' some of the more popular and authoritative , such as the application of a purely moral standard in the judgment of literature ; the division of literature into different species or genres , such as lyric , comedy , tragedy , epic , pastoral , and similar vague abstractions ; the theory of style , conceiving style as something separate from the work of art itself ; the conception of the drama as a mechan - ical rather than a creative art , involving a knowl - edge of the rules of the theatre rather than the movements of the human heart ; the idea of tech - nique as distinct from the essence of art itself ; the theory of the influence of race , time , and environment on the work of men of letters ; and , finally , the theory of the '' evolution '' of litera - ture .

		It may be that I have been mistaken in conceiving some of these theories to be arbitrary standards of taste , but that is not the main ques - tion involved .

		The main problem is merely this whether criticism should attempt to be creative in the sense of re-creating the artist 's work in its own mind , and then , and only then , evolving its judgment ; or whether it should unthinkingly hold to the old standards and conventions that have come down to us from the past , and mechanically accept a work of art only in so far as it agrees or disagrees with these traditional standards .

		The question at issue between us , then , is not whether the critic should judge literature , but how he should judge it ; not whether he should forego all judgment , but whether he should judge rightly or wrongly ; in a word , whether the critic 's touch - stone should be external and mechanical or internal and vital .

		Professor
Perry	PERSON	, I think , has done me an injus - tice in summing up my position by quoting a few phrases of mine torn from their context ; and thus distorted , it may seem an easy thing to controvert my position even with the vague and graceful argu - ments of Victorian tradition .

		Many a Bohemian gathering , he says -LRB- I have not his article at hand and can merely paraphrase from memory -RRB- , repeals the
Ten Commandments	ORGANIZATION	in the fervor of
midnight	TIME	, only to find in the disillusion of the next morning that the Ten Commandments `` will not budge . ''

		I do not intend to confuse the issue by being drawn into an argument that involves not only Biblical exegesis but the philosophy of history and the relativity of morals ; but I must protest at having the ethical standards of a primitive folk imposed not only on universal history but on the criticism of all literature .

		It would be too obvious a retort to say that the Decalogue did budge between '' Exodus '' and ''
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	, '' and budged still more before `` Romans '' was reached , where the
Ten Commandments	ORGANIZATION	are actually reduced to four .

		It would be still easier to point out that there is not a single commandment out of the ten which has not been disregarded from Old Testament days to our own , and the disregarding of which has not been justified by the moral conscience of men , whether it be the edict against murder , disregarded for cen - turies in the code of the duello and to-day in the code of war ; whether it be the edict against steal - ing , which has been disregarded and is still disre - garded by every nation on earth in our own time by
England	LOCATION	in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, by
Italy	LOCATION	in
Tripoli	LOCATION	, by the
Balkan States	LOCATION	in
Macedonia	LOCATION	, and by the
United States	LOCATION	in
Puerto Rico	LOCATION	; or whether
1914	DATE	THE DIAL it be any of the other of the Ten , which have never had the same consideration by men .

		But this , after all , is only a side issue ; the important fact is that any comparison between the judgment of an act in practical life and the judg - ment of a work of art must inevitably be false .

		If there is one common concept which has ap - parently impressed itself on philosophic thought from the days of Plato to our own , it is that there is a fundamental distinction between the useful or mechanical arts on the one hand and the liberal arts on the other .

		Any comparison of the method of criticism with the method used in the practical conduct of life or in the mechanical operation of any of the useful arts and sciences must in itself be fundamentally false .

		There is then no connection whatever between the Deca - logue and the standards of criticism , and Professor
Perry	PERSON	might have said with an equal appearance of truth , but an equal fundamental falsity , that many a Bohemian gathering repeals the Ten Com - mandments in the fervor of
midnight	TIME	, only to find in the disillusion of the next morning that cabbages do not grow on grapevines .

		If I were to attempt to sum up the whole matter , I should say this that art is simply the en - deavor of the human mind to express itself , to give shape in words or in marble or on canvas to its fancy and its imagination ; and all that we can ask of it is that it shall be a true and vital expression .

		We can not ask it to compete with practical life , or with utilitarian arts .

		We can simply say that since beauty is its own excuse for being , the imagination achieves its end when it expresses itself .

		No edict ever enunciated by the masters of criticism can hold water a single moment after a great work of art imposes its new beauty upon us .

		All we can ask of it is whether it has obeyed the laws which it itself has evolved in the moment of its creation not whether it has been true to others , but whether it has been true to itself .

		THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION AND DENOMINATIONAL COLLEGES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		An article in THE DIAL for
July 16	DATE	, headed `` A Live Wire , '' has much with which the present writer can heartily agree .

		According to the most reliable accounts the President of the
New York City Board of Education	ORGANIZATION	,
Thomas W. Churchill	PERSON	, has shown himself wholly unsuited to such a posi - tion , and something more than the interests of the schools must have been behind Mayor
Mitchell	PERSON	's action in reappointing him .

		In one paragraph , however , the writer of the article in question says of Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	: '' It was only the other day that he distinguished himself by a violent onslaught upon that worthiest of educational philanthropies , the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, on the ground , forsooth , that Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	does not choose to extend his benefaction to institutions that flout the very idea of a university by establishing sectarian tests for their teaching . ''

		To the latter part of this sentence I wish to enter most positive objection .

		It lumps in a single class the large number of educational institutions founded by religious denominations and not eligible to participation in the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, and characterizes them all as flouting the very idea of a university by establishing sectarian tests for their teaching .

		If the writer of this indictment had looked over a list of the institutions thus charged with sectarian narrowness and contempt for uni - versity ideals , he would have found therein more than one institution entitled to high rank as uni - versities , using the term in its strictly technical sense , as distinguished from the college , devoted to undergraduate work .

		-LRB- It must be remembered , however , that the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	is open to colleges as well as to universities . -RRB-

		But the list of institutions cut off from partici - pation in the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	fails to tally with this indictment not merely because it in - cludes genuine universities , of high order .

		It includes also a large number of colleges against which the charge of sectarian narrowness in their teaching is wholly unjustified .

		It is a well-known fact that a few institutions have passed from the excluded to the accepted list by technical changes in their charters , occasioning no change whatever in the spirit , purpose , or content of their class - room work .

		Others which could have accomplished the same end with just as little change have re - frained from doing so because of a desire to avoid even the appearance of a willingness to sacrifice principle for material gain .

		These colleges which do not receive the benefit of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's pension fund have educated a large share of the men now composing the faculties of the colleges and uni - versities which do receive that benefit .

		The nar - row-minded man is found occasionally on either side of the line .

		His narrowness has its roots in the frailty of human nature , not in his connections as a Presbyterian , a Progressive , a Protectionist , or a Pragmatist .

		His narrowness may break out at any point , and it may rage all the more nar - rowly in the institution that concerns itself least with the individual beliefs of its teachers .

		A governing board may occasionally be narrow - minded .

		This , however , is the exception , not the rule , and it takes no very exhaustive research to unearth the fact that board narrowness is not con - fined to one side of the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	line .

		Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, of course , had the right to his own selection of institutions which he would aid .

		I am not offended by his choice , though I do believe that he would have made it on a different basis but for a false idea of the real nature of most American denominational colleges .

		I do not like to see
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, which has stood always for keen insight and broad sympathy , contribute to the spread of that false idea .

Belgium	LOCATION	.

		He might easily have given stronger emphasis to the irony of the Anglo-French understanding .

		Because of the mad act of a Servian fanatic a great nation at the other extremity of

		His English , curiously enough in one holding so important a position on the foremost En - glish newspaper , is said to have been execrable .

		Blowitz had the adventurer 's love of the wealthy and powerful .

		In him , poverty or failure excited no pity , and one who afforded him no copy was a ' nobody , ' the lowest rank to which a man could descend .

		A criminal on a large scale excited
Blowitz	PERSON	's imagination , and he dwelt with an almost friendly interest on rascality that amounted to genius .

France	LOCATION	friends , '' a schedule now published by him in his book and bearing marks of thought and insight .

		With the opening of the new century he saw what he considered a favorable opportunity for starting the movement .

		Let the story be told as far as possible in his own words . ''

		I believe I once heard ' luck ' defined as a courageous insight into the capabilities of a chance .

		At any rate , I have always so regarded luck .

		Chances of all kinds and qualities abound .

		The difficulty is just to distinguish among them .

		I was on the lookout for a chance to launch the great idea that
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	by their geograph - ical position , by their political affinities , by their differences of character which made them indis - pensable to each other 's intellectual development , by the divergency of their industrial and artistic activity which made the one the complement of the other , had a joint and not a competing mis - sion in the world ; that they would benefit as much by their friendship as they were losing by their antagonism ; that
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	as democ - racies , having nothing to gain by war , were neces - sarily agents of peace ; and that their friendship would be a first step towards the abatement of those armaments which the Emperor of
Russia	LOCATION	in
1898	DATE	had justly described as ' a crushing burden more and more difficult for nations to bear . ' ''

		Early in
1901	DATE	Sir
Thomas	PERSON	was invited to deliver the address at the approaching annual
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 101 meeting of the
French Arbitration Society	ORGANIZATION	, and though there was a very small attendance owing to an unusually severe snowstorm , the occasion turned out to be little short of epoch - making , thanks to the action of the `` Figaro '' in publishing the address after its editor had all but refused to give his endorsement to what he characterized as merely a beautiful dream .

		Other newspapers all over
France	LOCATION	re - printed the speech , and the leading British journals gave it their attention , but in every instance with a caution that showed each to .

		be waiting for some one else to add the appro - priate word of assent or dissent .

		Nevertheless the speaker was so far encouraged that , as he tells us , he made arrangements to devote all his time and means henceforward to his self - imposed task .

		It was the French peace socie - ties that gave him the first emphatic support ; then followed endorsements from chambers of commerce and trade associations , and soon the movement had gained considerable headway . ''

		My life for the next two years was one of wild activity , a life of sleeping in trains , speaking sometimes several times a day , sometimes twice in one evening .

		I invented -LRB- oh , mother necessity ! -RRB-

		a quick-change shirt , a quick-change l dickie , ' a quick-change tie , a travelling bag adapted to my requirements , and at all times packed and ready for use at a moment 's notice .

		In
America	LOCATION	it amused my friends to see me turn into evening dress , quite decent enough to pass muster , in ten minutes . ''

		This activity was not without gratifying re - sults .

		After much public discussion and par - liamentary deliberation the convention or agreement of
April , 1904	DATE	, was signed , and there dawned upon
Europe	LOCATION	what the prime mover in this momentous business was pleased to regard as a new era .

		He himself received numerous tributes in recognition of his public services : the
King	PERSON	conferred a knighthood ,
France	LOCATION	made him an officer in the
Legion of Honor	ORGANIZATION	, and congratulatory letters from emi - nent men in both countries poured in upon him .

		His activities had extended even to our own quarter of the globe , and here he had made many friends in the course of his advocacy of more cordial Anglo-American re - lations .

		His '' fellow - townsman of Dunferm - line , '' as he calls Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, was of course one of these , and Secretary Hay was another , some notable words from whose lips the writer takes occasion to record .

		`` Mr.
Hay	PERSON	one day observed to me , '' he says , `` that the Fathers of the Constitution had made a deplorable mis - take in investing the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	with executive powers , for it simply meant that the
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	passed his life with discouragement in his soul and anger in his language . ''

		Curiously significant at the present time be - comes the semi-official assurance of the ' ' Nord - deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung '' to the German public , soon after the signing of the agree - ment , that there was no cause for apprehen - sion in the Anglo-French understanding ; and it is perhaps provocative of a satirical smile to recall the
Kaiser	PERSON	's
Bremen	LOCATION	speech of
March 22 , 1905	DATE	, in which he described the German Empire -LRB- we quote from our author -RRB- as `` a quiet , honest , and peaceful neighbour ; and added that if ever history should come to speak of a German world-wide Empire , or a world-wide dominion of the Hohenzollerns , this empire , this dominion , would have been founded upon conquests gained not by the sword but by the mutual confidence of those nations which press towards the same goal . ''

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, as in
France	LOCATION	, Sir
Thomas Bar	PERSON	- clay let his voice be heard in favor of friend - lier relations with
England	LOCATION	.

		He has also exerted his influence to promote industrial har - mony , being the founder of the
International Brotherhood Alliance	ORGANIZATION	and a vigorous sup - porter of arbitration and conciliation in all trade disputes .

		With what feelings he con - templates the present glaring signs of retro - gression in the affairs of international peace and industrial concord may be surmised .

		They can not be feelings of unmixed satisfaction .

		Not to leave with the reader the impression that the book under review is a mere record of peace-promotion , it should be said in clos - ing that the writer 's pages abound in anecdote and incident and character-sketch , in the re - production of many a shrewd or witty remark from persons of eminence , in observations and reflections on a great variety of matters , chiefly of public interest , and in evidences of various kinds that show the author to be both a many-sided man of the world and also an accomplished scholar and man of letters .

		He it was who with a number of French friends successfully urged the formation in
Paris	LOCATION	of a
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	committee to cooperate in the proposed Shakespearean celebration two years hence , a committee headed by
M. Ana	PERSON	- tole
France	LOCATION	as president d'honneur and not lacking in other distinguished names .

		It is to be noted in passing that , as a consistent Liberal , he is strongly in favor of woman suffrage , as he demonstrated when he was in
Parliament	LOCATION	not long ago .

		`` Thirty Years '' is a thoroughly interesting book , and a timely one , though its timeliness is partly of a sort not at all expected or de - sired by its author .

		A variety of appended matter , a good index , and a frontispiece por - trait from a water-color drawing , complete the volume 's equipment .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	Ax AMERICAX ENCYCLOPEDIA OF HORTICULTURE .

		* The subject of horticulture has never reached the stage of general interest in the
United States	LOCATION	that it attained long ago in
England	LOCATION	.

		We have developed horticulture largely in its commercial aspects , but the cul - tivation of plants just for the pleasure of cultivating them and of associating with them has not appealed very strongly to the
Ameri	PERSON	- can , who prefers to buy what he wants with the minimum trouble .

		But the development of parks and country places has begun to change this sentiment , and plants are coming into their own , not merely as sources of food , but as sources of pleasure .

		The publication of a great work on horticulture , therefore , is timely , and should go far toward stimulating further an interest that is already aroused .


Bailey	PERSON	's `` Cyclopedia of American Horti - culture '' began to appear in
1900	DATE	, and the four volumes were completed in
1902	DATE	.

		It was intended to be a complete record of North American horticulture as it existed at the close of the nineteenth century .

		For more than a decade , therefore , this work has been the standard authority upon the plants cul - tivated in
North America	LOCATION	, and upon the methods of culture .

		During this decade , how - ever , the horticultural interests of the
United States	LOCATION	and of
Canada	LOCATION	have become much ex - tended , not only on account of the tropical connections that have been established , but also on account of the greatly increased inter - est in the introduction of foreign plants .

		The somewhat provincial horticulture of the
United States	LOCATION	has disappeared , and the whole world has been laid under tribute for plants suited to our extremely diversified conditions .

		In addition to this , the interest in the culti - vation of plants has extended beyond flowers , vegetable gardens , orchards , and field crops , and includes now woody plants , from shrub - beries to forest plantations .

		Not only has there been a great change in the scope of horticultural operations , but methods of plant - breeding have developed with remarkable rapidity during the last decade .

		The enor - mous amount of experimental work in genetics and in soil studies has resulted in practical applications that have revolutionized many of the methods of obtaining and handling plants .

		It is obvious that the old Cyclopedia was sadly out of date , and had become a valuable historical record rather than a presentation of the horticultural interests of to-day .

		For - tunately , the editor decided to let the old work * THE STANDARD CYCLOPEDIA OF HORTICULTURE .

		Edited by
L. H. Bailey	PERSON	.

		New , rewritten , and enlarged edition .

		Volume I. , A-B .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		stand as a record , and to prepare an entirety new one , new in its scope and in its title , `` The Standard Cyclopedia of Horticulture . ''

		Although prepared from the American stand - point , the geographical limitation disappears from the title , since it could not and should not be observed .

		The new work will be com - plete in six volumes , and this increase in size is some indication of the great increase in the magnitude of the subject .

		In the former
Cyclopedia	ORGANIZATION	, the plants treated were largely those `` sold in the
United States	LOCATION	and -
Canada	LOCATION	. ' '

		This means that one consult - ing the lists of nurserymen , seedsmen , etc. , ' could find in the Cyclopedia an authoritative statement in reference to the plants offered for sale , and suggestions as to culture .

		The new work accepts this basis in general , but it is interpreted to include also the offerings of European dealers to the American market .

		Species no longer of interest to horticulturists are excluded , for `` dead entries '' would make the work too voluminous and would not serve its purpose of being a current , record .

		Of course , many plants cultivated in botanic gar - dens , public parks , and private grounds will not be found in the new Cyclopedia .

		A quo - tation from the preface states compactly the general aim of the work : '' The Cyclopedia aims to account for the plants horticulturally grown within its territory which are now the subjects of living interest or likely to be introduced , to discuss the best practices in the grow - ing of the staple flowers and fruits and vegetable crops , to depict the horticultural capabilities of the states and provinces , to indicate the literature of the field , and incidentally to portray briefly the lives of the former men and women who have attained to a large or a national reputation in horti - cultural pursuits . ''

		Concisely stated , the new Cyclopedia has two main purposes : -LRB- 1 -RRB- the identification of species , so that one may recognize the cultural plants he meets ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- the cultivation of plants , so that one may know the approved methods of growing plants for different pur - poses .

		The first purpose can be carried out very definitely arid precisely , but the second purpose is beset with difficulties .

		The cul - tural conditions in
North America	LOCATION	are as nu - merous and varied as are the assemblages of native plants .

		Directions for one region can - not apply to all regions , so that competent plant-breeders in one region may contradict equally competent plant-breeders in another region .

		The editor , therefore , calls attention to the fact -LRB- and it needs emphasis -RRB- that no one can grow plants by a book .

		He can read statements of standard practice , but with this as a basis , he must experiment with his own conditions .

		Every one who grows plants suc - cessfully , therefore , must have enough initia -
1914	DATE	THE DIAL 103 tive to be more or less of an experimenter , to whom the experiences of others are sug - gestive , but for whom his own experience is final .

		The introductory matter in the first volume , which comprises 180 pages , as contrasted with nine pages in the old work , is another illustra - tion of the larger scope of the new work , which seeks to serve more people in more ways .

		There are pages of `` explanations '' which enable the users of the work to understand abbreviations , authorship , keys , etc. .

		An en - tirely new feature , extending through seventy - eight pages , is `` A Synopsis of the
Plant Kingdom	LOCATION	, ' ' by Mr.
Karl M. Wiegand	PERSON	, which is a very complete , illustrated outline of the classification of the plant kingdom , from the thallophytes to the seed plants .

		Of course the vascular plants receive the most attention .

		To those who are familiar only with the few plants under cultivation , this marshalling of the whole plant kingdom will be most impres - sive , and they will also be able to see where the plants they know fit into the general scheme .

		Then there is a key to the families and genera , which , with its index , comprises about seventy pages .

		This was certainly a laborious and difficult undertaking , and evidently the editor consented to include it only under pres - sure .

		It is intended to help the cultivator of plants to determine the name of any plant cultivated in
America	LOCATION	, including also the wild flowers commonly offered for sale .

		In other words , it is a manual of the cultivated and more common wild plants of
America	LOCATION	.

		Those who have prepared manuals will appreciate what such a task involved .

		The test of a key comes in using it , so that no one can tell in advance whether this key will serve its pur - pose or not .

		One of the interesting helps provided is a long list -LRB- twelve pages -RRB- of the English equiva - lents of Latin names of species .

		Most spe - cific names mean something characteristic of the plant , but to most persons the meaning is not obvious , so that this list of translations will be very helpful .

		Then , of course , a glos - sary is necessary in using keys and reading descriptions .

		This introductory manual , occupying nearly two hundred pages , is really an introduction to an intelligent use of the Cyclopedia for those who have had no training in botany , and many who are growing plants success - fully have had no such training .

		The first volume begins with Abaca and closes with
Byrsonima	PERSON	, and most of the titles are signed , so that responsibility is fixed .

		The titles are exceedingly variable , including not merely the names of cultivated plants , but also general topics .

		For example , such topics are treated as alpine plants , annuals , ants , aquatics , arboretum , arboriculture , autumn colors , bees , biennials , birds , botanic gardens , breeding of plants ,
British North America	LOCATION	, etc. .

		A single illustration may be used to show the method of treatment in the case of culti - vated plants .

		Under
Apple	ORGANIZATION	will be found twenty-one profusely illustrated pages , treat - ing this important fruit from every point of view .

		After a preliminary historical state - ment in reference to the origin of apples in general , and noteworthy varieties , and also an account of the general range and method of cultivation , apple-growing in different regions is discussed , with an account of the favored forms , the cultural methods , and the impor - tant enemies .

		The apple regions discussed separately are Northeastern states ,
Canada	LOCATION	,
Southern Alleghany Mountain	ORGANIZATION	region , Mid - continental or plains districts , Western moun - tain states ,
Oregon	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	, and
California	LOCATION	.

		Such a presentation will be a mine of information to every one interested in apple-growing in any region .

		It is needless to comment upon the fitness of Professor
Bailey	PERSON	to undertake the direction of this great work .

		No one else has had so extensive a grasp upon general horticulture for so long a time ; so that any presentation that organizes his experience may be taken as an authoritative presentation of horticulture as it exists .

		This does not mean necessarily horticulture as it might be and will be ; but it does mean that this record of horticulture as it is omits nothing important and states each situation with full knowledge .


JOHN M. COULTER	PERSON	.

		HEROIC Vii > L , Arvs .

		* Is there a well-defined class of plays in which the roles of villain and hero are merged ?

		If so , where did this sort of play come from ?

		What is the origin of the villain - hero 's character , and what appeal does he make to us ?

		How must he be drawn to inter - est us most deeply ?

		These are some of the questions that Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	tries to answer in his present study , which was written as a thesis for the doctor 's degree at
Princeton	LOCATION	.

		The title of the book at once suggests difficul - ties of classification .

		Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	of course uses ' ' hero ' ' in the sense of ' ' protagonist . '' ''

		Vil - lain '' he discusses at some length , finally arriving at this definition : `` a man who for a selfish end wilfully and deliberately violates standards of morality sanctioned by the * THE VILLAIN AS HERO IN ELIZABETHAN TRAGEDY .

		This is not altogether satisfactory ; it would seem for in - stance to include
Antony	LOCATION	, though Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	maintains that
Antony	PERSON	`` is not a villain be - cause he is not trying to advance his own interests . ''

		This quibble suggests that the test for villainy is going to raise some nice points in casuistry ; and it does .

		Take the case of Vindici in `` The Revenger 's Tragedy , '' a clear example , according to Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	, of a villain-hero .

		Technically he can be brought under the definition ; but it is safe to say that he did not appear a villain to the Elizabethan audience , and would not so appear to a mod - ern reader if the reader were not searching for plays of the villain-hero type .

		Certainly he is not the villain of the piece ; in fact he is on the whole the least villainous person in it , and his cruel vengeance would be fully jus - tified by Elizabethan ethics .

		Or consider
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	, who also in Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	's catalogue is writ down a villain .

		No doubt he becomes one in the course of the story ; but he is not in any sense a villain when he wins our sym - pathy ; and this simple fact , not considered by Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	, makes a great difference in the dramatist 's problem .

		The question who is the protagonist would seem less likely to cause trouble ; but the de - sire to magnify the importance of the villain - hero type of play has led Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	to regard the villain as protagonist of several impor - tant plays in which the chief interest and sym - pathy of the audience is claimed by some other character .

		`` Othello , '' for instance , is in - cluded because it is `` a play with two protag - onists . ''

		This very fact should have warned the author that it is not to be treated as if it were in the same class with ``
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		; yet he calmly proceeds to test lago by the standards he has derived from
Richard	LOCATION	.

		Per - haps the clearest instance of the distorted criticism which results from forcing plays into a class where they do not belong is the case of `` The Duchess of Malfi . ''

		`` The Duchess of Malfi '' is a powerful and brilliant story play , intensely tragic in tone .

		`` Cymbeline '' would be its nearest analogue , if the tragic element in `` Cymbeline '' had received more emphasis .

		In both plays the emphasis is more on story than on character ; in both the heroine is the most interesting person , and the next in inter - est , by a long remove , is the villain .

		If you can imagine what would happen to `` Cym - beline '' in the hands of a critic who regarded it as a villain-hero play with lachimo as pro- tagonist , you will have a tolerable idea of how
Webster	PERSON	's play fares at the hands of Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	.

		He regards Bosola as the hero , and complains that `` he is not great enough , '' he has `` no grandeur of soul , '' he lacks `` the in - trepidity and brilliance of a Richard . ' '

		Why not f He was never intended to be a
Richard	LOCATION	.

		But your critic with a theory is always con - demning things for not being what they were never intended to be .

		Aside from such distortions due to bad clas - sification , the chief weakness of the book is its tendency to regard poetic justice as essential to good drama .

		On this point the author 's attitude wavers somewhat , but in general he seems to feel that at least the virtuous should not be allowed to suffer too much , and the scoundrels should be made conscious that their sins have brought adequate punishment .

		`` No tragic effect is produced '' in the `` Re - venger 's Tragedy , ' ' for instance , because ' ' the truth is not driven home that the fate of the guilty is any more inevitable than that of the guiltless . ''

		The reader feels like inquiring where this `` truth '' is `` driven home '' in ' ' Lear '' or '' Othello . ' '

		So also ' ' Measure for Measure '' is severely criticized because the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	's solution of the difficulty `` is not cal - culated to restore a respect for law , nor is it in the slightest degree appropriate to Angelo 's wickedness .

		Our sense of justice is outraged . ' '

		This is the old , old fallacy of Shakespeare criticism , which persists in spite of exposure .

		On the whole Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	has failed to show that there is a distinct class of villain-hero plays with its own peculiarities of technique .

		Plays with this characteristic seem to have little else in common ; and most of them could be more satisfactorily classified elsewhere .

		He has failed also in his attempt to connect such plays with
Seneca	LOCATION	.

		None of the plays dis - cussed shows any relation to
Seneca	LOCATION	's `` Thy - estes '' or `` Medea , '' in which Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	thinks the type originated ; only one of them , and this one of the least important , shows any direct Senecan influence .

		The early plays on the Senecan model do not , even in Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	's judgment , belong to the villain-hero type ; and the early plays which he regards as of this type are not at all Senecan .

		But he has suc - ceeded in making an interesting study of dif - ferent kinds of villains ; what he has to say of the development of the revengeful villain , for instance , is extremely suggestive , though we may not be able to agree with his view of lago as the perfect exemplar of the type .

		A greater merit is his clear account of the in - fluence of the Machiavellian or pseudo-Mach - iavellian ethics upon the Elizabethan villains .

		He shows pretty conclusively that ``
Machia	LOCATION	- vellism '' on the English stage is largely traceable to Gentillet 's '' Anti-Machiavel , '' published in
1576	DATE	and translated by
Simon Patericke	PERSON	in the next year .

		Lorenzo in ' ' The Spanish Tragedy '' and
Marlowe	PERSON	's Barabas established the type for the stage , and were
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 105 followed by a long series of `` Machiavellian '' villains .

		This is much the most valuable part of the thesis , and it was on this line that Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	's investigation began .

		But he was led astray by the will-o ' - the-wisp of a definite villain-hero type of play , and by the wish to show that
Aristotle	PERSON	was wrong in saying that the fall of a bad man into adversity can not be tragic .

		Now in all Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	's list there is only one possible exception to
Aristotle	LOCATION	's dictum , ' '
Richard III	PERSON	. '' ''

		Macbeth ' ' is not an exception ; for it is not the fall of a bad man which makes `` Macbeth '' tragic , but the suffering and ruin of a man originally good and great .

		``
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		has seemed to some critics an exception , but is it really one ?

		Is it not strong and brilliant melodrama rather than tragedy ?

		Surely the emotions it rouses are not of the same kind as those inspired by `` Hamlet '' or `` Lear . ''

		Nevertheless , Dr.
Boyer	PERSON	thinks , it inspires awe , pity for the waste of great powers , and fear of the force of evil personified in
Richard	LOCATION	; and these , he maintains , are tragic emotions .

		But even if we admit his point , and it is open to attack , one play is a rather narrow foundation for an important addition to the theory of tragedy .

		Two or three slips in proofreading may be worth noting : Cynthio for Cinthio -LRB- p. 116 -RRB- ; Lassurioso for Lussurioso -LRB- p. 151 -RRB- ; and Ar - treus for Atreus -LRB- p. 178 -RRB- .

		* It seems fairly evident that the `` seventy years of immortality '' which
Samuel Butler	PERSON	predicted for himself are now , twelve years after his death , well under way .

		This result has been brought about largely through the attractive new editions of his chief works which have been appearing at intervals for several years past .

		The most recent of these are `` The Humor of Homer '' and `` The Fair Haven . ''

		The sub-title of the latter volume bears a forbidding aspect : `` A Work in

		By
Samuel Butler	PERSON	.

		Edited , with an Introduction , by
R. A. Streatfeild	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		cent fiction proves
Butler	PERSON	to be the legitimate
Elisha	LOCATION	to those two eighteenth century Elijahs of irony , DeFoe and Swift .

		Indeed there is a very close connection between DeFoe 's `` Shortest Way with Dissenters '' and `` The Fair Haven . ''

		Both are works of ironical orthodoxy which had a success almost past belief .

		Humor must have been dead in the Church of
England	LOCATION	in
1702	DATE	, that so many loyal souls welcomed seriously with pious joy DeFoe 's suggestion to hang every Dissenter .

		And it must have been sorely afflicted in
1873	DATE	when
Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	derived such comfort from
Butler	PERSON	's argument that , since
Strauss	PERSON	admitted the death of Jesus and other heretics admitted that he was seen alive after his supposed -LRB- but fictitious -RRB- death , the whole orthodox position was historically vindicated .

		Forty years have passed ; yet this book of theological controversy is remarkably up-to - date , and is furnishing material for current popularizations of a view which in the me - dieval seventies must have represented its author , to the devout who chanced upon it , as a creature horned , hoofed , and damned .

		The editor points out in his introduction to the new edition an interesting relation be - tween this successful irony and
Butler	PERSON	's ob - security during his lifetime .

		Reviewers , he says , who had been taken in by `` The Fair Haven , '' `` fought shy of him for the rest of his life ... The word went forth that
Butler	PERSON	was not to be taken seriously , whatever he wrote , and the results of the decree were ap - parent in the conspiracy of silence that greeted not only his books on evolution , but his Homeric works , his writings on art , and his edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets . ''

		This opinion seems altogether plausible ; some - thing like the fact is antecedently probable in order to explain how a writer of
Butler	PERSON	's force , humor , and perspicacity should require discovery by the generation following his own .

		But even when handled by the most viva - cious , theology has few charms for the present - day general reader , who cares very little whether
Strauss	PERSON	or
Butler	PERSON	or Dean
Alford	PERSON	was right .

		And so the other of these two reprints , ' ' The Humor of Homer , ' ' will prove of immeasurably greater interest .

		A valuable feature is the Memoir by Mr.
H. Festing Jones	PERSON	, which though written only to do tem - porary service until Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's full work on
Butler	PERSON	appears , is nevertheless the best account of
Butler	PERSON	's life at present available .

		The contents of the volume , consisting of two lectures before the Working Men 's Col - lege ,
London	LOCATION	, one before the
Somerville Club	ORGANIZATION	, and a number of short essays contributed to `` The Universal Review '' during
1889	DATE	and
1890	DATE	, show
Butler	PERSON	at his miscellaneous best .

		106 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	As one would very naturally expect , the three essays entitled collectively '' The Deadlock in Darwinism '' are the poorest .

		It is the anomaly of
Butler	PERSON	's life that a writer of his humor and sense of proportion should have seriously de - voted a large part of his life to pseudo-scien - tific haggling over Darwinism .

		Perhaps this is only a post factiim judgment , incited by the fact that
Butler	PERSON	, so modern in theology and art and criticism , is yearly growing more antiquated in science . ' '

		Thought and Language ' ' is better reading , as well as a more convincing scientific docu - ment ; but it does not approach the interest we find in the papers on art , especially '' The Sanctuary of Montrigone '' and `` A Medieval Girl School . ''

		In the intelligent levity which characterizes
Butler	PERSON	's treatment of mediaeval church art there is nothing of the ill-nature that one can not miss at times in his contro - versies , and especially in his novel , ' ' The Way of All Flesh , '' where the fallacies are too near to be treated with urbanity .

		In the paper on `` A Medieval Girl School '' he takes occasion to justify or explain his apparent cynicism : `` And after all , what is the essence of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity ?

		What is the kernel of the nut ?

		Surely common sense and cheerfulness , with unflinching opposition to the Charlatanisms and Pharisaisms of a man 's own times ... -LSB- It is -RSB- in speaking the truth , in finding the true life rather in others than in oneself , and in the certain hope that he who loses his life on these behalfs finds more than he has lost ... I should be shocked if anything I had ever written or shall ever write should seem to make light of these things .

		I should be shocked also -LSB- and here we find his mind reverting to the Black Virgins of mediaeval art , the satire in the Iliad and so on -RSB- if I did not know how to be amused with things that amiable people obviously intended to be amusing . ''

		But let us come finally to the best .

		`` For mere reading , '' says
Butler	PERSON	in `` Quis Desi - derio ... ? ''

		`` I suppose one book is pretty much as good as another . ''

		To this gentle judgment we must demur , for the first three papers in this volume are far and away the best for '' mere reading '' that
Butler	PERSON	offers .

		True , ' ' The Humor of Homer ' ' contains some - thing besides `` mere reading . ''

		In it is found the core of his later work on ' ' The Authoress of the Odyssey , '' as well as considerations , not found elsewhere in his writings , concern - ing the broad humor of the
Iliad	LOCATION	, in its treat - ment of women and of gods especially .

		We may not here discuss

		The com - ment on

		RECENT FICTIOX .

		* One test of a novel is to read it on a train .

		It is perhaps not a fair test and it is cer - tainly not an objective test .

		Some readers find travel so much a bore that anything to read is better than nothing and others find reading while travelling forty miles an hour -LRB- even over the best of road-beds -RRB- so uncom - fortable that nothing is better than anything .

		But for that matter there is no situation for reading that is not open to similar objections .

		There are persons whose particular pleasure it is to read in bed and others who would never think of such a thing .

		There are read - ers who can enjoy no book to the full unless they can read it aloud and there are read - ers or listeners who actually prefer to be read aloud to .

		I know of no circumstance or set of circumstances which is especially favorable to the author whose book it is my business of the moment to read .

		There are books which I have stayed up all night to * TELLING THE TRUTH .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAI , 107 finish and there are books which I have so far escaped finishing .

		But I must in honesty admit that a novel must interest ' me very much before I can read it on a train .

		I almost always have a novel with me during the fifty minutes morning and evening that I spend in getting to and from the city and I almost never read it .

		All of the six novels below have had the op - portunity of that fifty minutes and none of them has been equal to it which is only to say that when I did read them it was rather more as a duty than as a pleasure .

		Mr.
William Hewlett	PERSON	's new novel , `` Tell - ing the Truth , '' falls just short of being as interesting as the moving panorama to be seen from my train .

		Its flippancy of tone strikes one at once as annoying rather than as amusing .

		One of the early pages , in which the first-person narrator is telling of an occa - sion during his boyhood when he was so affected by the beauty of a scene in Kent as to ejaculate that it was a `` ripping place '' is an example of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's quality : '' I wanted to expatiate on its beauties , to de - scribe the picturesque aspect of the village green , the duck pond , the quaint red-roofed cottages , the distant woods on fire with
November	DATE	sunshine , the spirit of tranquillity and aloofness brooding over the place .

		But all eyes were upon * me .

		I was a schoolboy .

		Something mildly humorous was expected of me .

		Like the comedian in a panto - mime , I had to ' get my laugh . '

		All this , or some - thing like it , passed through my mind in a flash , and I answered : ' We found a jolly tuck-shop there . '

		There was a general laugh , as I had known there would be , but it woke no triumphant echo in my childish breast .

		My brother turned away with a ' pooh P of banished interest .

		I knew that I had failed , that I had not done myself justice , that I had been the veriest slave of convention .

		And , what was worse , I knew that he did n't know it .

		That was the most damned mortifying part of the whole business ! ''

		None of the remaining five novels is much worse or much better than Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's .

		Mr.
Leroy Scott	PERSON	, who once wrote a novel about a labor leader or the like , has conceived `` No. 13
Washington	LOCATION	Square '' in the vein of broad farce .

		The complications of which the story is made centre about a leader , or more precisely , the leader of
New York	LOCATION	society .

		Mrs. De Peyster could not make her annual trip to
Europe	LOCATION	because her railroad failed to declare a dividend so she planned secretly to spend an economical
summer	DATE	in her Fifth Avenue residence .

		Her plan would have worked better than it did if her son had not made a similar one .

		She had disinherited him because he wanted to go to work .

		He had immediately married the nice but ineligible girl he was in love with .

		The two , having every reason to believe the family mansion deserted , thought to spend their honeymoon in it .

		Such a plot finds its best use on the stage .

		The let-down at the end since the more elaborate the scheme the more disap - pointing the final solution is inevitable .

		Mr.
Edginton	PERSON	's novel is a more imaginative farce than Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's .

		It depends not so much on complications although these are achieved as on an idea .

		How farce does gain by an idea !

		Mr.
Edginton	PERSON	's immoder - ately successful British business man suffered the double misfortune of a perfect wife and an innocent heart .

		She simply would not spend his money .

		When he could stand it no longer he found other young women who would .

		Nobody believed that his relations with these young persons were innocently avuncular .

		Even his wife 's first thought was of divorce though her second was a happier one .

		The whole is a kindly , humorous com - ment on the struggle between the sexes , `` The Lights Are Bright '' is old-fashioned romance with a villain , a hero , and a beautiful young woman who needs three hundred pages in which to discover her own mind .

		That the setting is in some respects contemporary steel mills in the foreground and the
Missabe	LOCATION	range in the background is incidental .

		Miss
Webster	PERSON	's novel is a serious attempt .

		The `` sheep track '' is the conventional way of upper middle-class society .

		Her reaction to it is reasonable rather than vigorous .

		She understands how necessary it is to most of those who travel it , how dangerous it is to those who can not or will not follow it , and how misleading it is to young persons pos - sessed of fine instincts , or energy , or special capacity .

		But she has no satisfactory idea of the sort of persons to be found in the sheep track ; those she presents are not much to the point .

		Her heroine is an attractive girl and that is well .

		An attractive girl adds as much to the possibilities of a serious novel as to those of a farce or a Victorian romance .

		Indeed , it might be shown that the creation of an attractive young woman is possible only to the serious novelist .

		But I am most unwilling to talk about `` creation '' in connection with a novel like `` The Sheep Track . ''

		Mr.
Leonard Merrick	PERSON	's boom has by now so flattened that I may speak of him in kindly terms without being understood to regard him with awe .

		`` When Love Flies Out o ' the Window , '' a novel several years old in En - giand but now published on this side for the first time , is competently done that is all .

		It is briskly yet nicely written but it drops easily into the incredible ending .

		Novels are not made by so amenable a talent .

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		The final volume lmne ^ of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's publication of The Journals of
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is complete , and the index at last makes the work available for the purposes of the student .

		It is a cause of some incon - venience that though the index references are by volume and page , the numbers of volumes do not appear on the binding , or even on the title-pages , but only on the half-title .

		The editing , throughout , though showing no re - markable scholarship or acumen , has been done in an intelligent and sympathetic man - ner that will be grateful to those who recall the crude mutilation of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's literary remains .

		The manuscripts on which these volumes are based contain jottings of many sorts , and are to be adequately described by no one word .

		Besides the entries that might be expected in a `` journal '' proper there are memoranda suggested by reading , and count - less notes that seem to have no reference to the especial day .

		As the publication of the correspondence with
Carlyle	PERSON	called attention to the fact that
Emerson	PERSON	was not great as a letter - writer , so these journals emphasize the fact that he is not eminently a diarist .

		Notes of facts and pregnant comments thereon are not wanting ; but the former are often dryly concise , and the latter rarely reveal much of the author .

		Only occasionally do we find a passage like this from the last volume , which , notwithstanding its length , must be quoted for its content and its charm of phrase .

		`` Yesterday ,

Franklin Pierce	PERSON	was with the family .

		The church was copiously decorated with white flowers deli - cately arranged .

		The corpse was unwillingly shown , only a few moments to this company of his friends .

		But it was noble and serene in its aspect , nothing amiss , a calm and powerful head .

		A large company filled the church and the grounds of the cemetery .

		All was so bright and quiet that pain or mourning was hardly suggested , and
Holmes	PERSON	said to me that it looked like a happy meeting ... '' I thought there was a tragic element in the event that might be more fully rendered , in the painful solitude of the man , which , I suppose , could not longer be endured , and he died of it . ''

		I have found in his death a surprise and dis - appointment .

		I thought him a greater man than any of his works betray , that there was still a great deal of work in him , and that he might one day show a purer power .

		Moreover , I have felt sure of him in his neighborhood , and in his neces - sities of sympathy and intelligence , that I could well wait his time , his unwillingness and caprice , and might one day conquer a friendship .

		It would have been a happiness , doubtless to both of us , to have come into habits of unreserved inter - course .

		It was easy to talk with him , there were no barriers , only , he said so little , that I talked too much , and stopped only because , as he gave no indications , I feared to exceed .

		He showed no egotism or self-assertion , rather a humility , and , at one time , a fear that he had written himself out .

		One day , when I found him on the top of his hill , in the woods , he paced back the path to his house , and said , ' This path is the only remem - brance of me that will remain . '

		Now it appears that I waited too long . ''

		Notwithstanding an occasional entry like this the student who hoped that the publication of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's Journals would reveal the secrets of his personality was destined to disappoint - ment .

		Unlike other diarists , he never shows himself for a moment in undress .

		There is no pose , no indication of self-consciousness ; the fact that he did not show himself more fully , that apparently he could not do so if he would , constitutes the baffling peculiarity of his na - ture .

		If the Journals are disappointing in their revelation of biography and personality , they may also to some be disappointing in their contribution to our knowledge of
Emer	PERSON	- son 's philosophy .

		They give much data from which to trace his intellectual development , but there are frequent gaps to be supplied .

		It was in these manuscripts that the author first jotted down many of the sentences that he afterward used in lectures and essays , and it is a proof of the sureness of his taste that those which he chose for use are usually better than those which remain for publication now .

		In the ten volumes are of course hundreds of worthy thoughts , strikingly expressed ; but one may sometimes read for pages without finding as many telling phrases as he will meet in one paragraph of the Essays .

		This state - ment of what the Journals do not give is but a warning to the reader who might expect too much , or expect the wrong things .

		They offer , if not so intimate a revelation of the man as we might wish , the best revelation we shall ever have .

		To the careful student of almost any topic connected with
Emerson	PERSON	they are rich in material that can be found no - where else , and every lover of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	should be grateful for their publication .

		Wanderings with
Milton	PERSON	.

		There is something pleasingly old-fashioned about Mr.
Alden Sampson	PERSON	's `` Studies in
Milton	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author has obviously long steeped his mind in his subject , and in much that is even remotely connected with it , after
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 109 a leisurely , brooding fashion quite exceptional to-day among American writers of `` books about books '' though still flourishing in En - gland -LRB- witness the latest works of Mr.
Stop	PERSON	- ford
Brooke	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Such concern for
Milton	LOCATION	, particularly , is valuable in
America	LOCATION	at the present time ; since our general attitude of mind is surely , in these days , more remote from
Milton	LOCATION	's , and more in need of what his can give us , than it has been in the past or is again likely to be .

		Not altogether desirable , however , is Mr.
Sampson	PERSON	's complete freedom from a certain nervous consciousness which leads the average present-day writer , in grap - pling with a great classic , to mass the most striking of his own views in the foreground , carefully deprecating minor points and his debts to previous critics .

		For the `` Studies '' evince not enough distinction of style and personal viewpoint to carry their leisurely method with real success .

		This fact is un - fortunately thrust upon the reader near the very beginning of the first and most im - portant of the essays , `` From Lycidas to Paradise Lost , '' when he is confronted , in connection with
Milton	PERSON	's early sonnet to the nightingale , with ten pages of comment upon the poet 's not very characteristic admiration for this bird , which had become so conven - tional a figure in Renaissance poetic scenery .

		In this connection , too , our author makes the surprising error of treating Satan 's tuneful temptation of Eve in her dream -LRB- Paradise Lost , Bk .

		V. , 1 .

		35ff -RRB- as ``
Adam	PERSON	's love-song to his new-found bride '' ; no such love-song occurs or is mentioned in the course of the poem .

		The reader should not infer from this instance , however , that the author has read his Para - dise Lost altogether skippingly , in search of passages to illustrate his points .

		The essay proceeds to take up in chronological order the remaining sonnets produced during
Milton	PERSON	's so-called middle period , endeavoring to relate each very fully with the poet 's personality , his life , and his greater works .

		Sometimes the relationships expatiated upon are too far - fetched .

		For instance , although one must feel continually in Paradise Lost the fervor of the Puritan rebellion , one does not like to be told explicitly that `` it is Satan himself that most nearly presents a reflex of the great Pro- tector , '' and to have several splendid pas - sages of the poem quoted merely on this text .

		The second essay in the book , `` Milton 's Con - fession of Faith , '' more insistently illustrates the author 's undue thirst for comparisons .

		The parallels he cites between
Milton	PERSON	's relig - ious ideas and those of
George Fox	ORGANIZATION	are often either too strained , or else too obvious for anyone acquainted with the common and quite natural methods by which the better minds of among the adherents of the reformed religion were endeavoring to rise above the ordinary level of Puritan dogmas .

		The third essay , on `` Certain Aspects of the Poetic Genius , '' is a readable presentation -LRB- though devoid of originality -RRB- of what the title suggests , the cen - tral theme being the nature of
Milton	LOCATION	's own genius .

		Certainly there is room for a s. compact life of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	.

		The excellent biog - raphy compiled by his friend
H. F. Brown	PERSON	is too expensive for the ordinary reader to own , and too full for his needs .

		Mr.
Van Wyck Brooks	PERSON	has undertaken to supply the lack of a convenient short study with this little volume entitled ``
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Ken	PERSON	- nerley -RRB- .

		For his facts he relies chiefly upon
Brown	PERSON	's book , though he has made some use of the biographies and letters of
Jowett	PERSON	,
Steven	PERSON	- son , and other friends of
Symonds	PERSON	.

		Without adding anything of importance that is new , he furnishes a fairly satisfactory outline of
Symonds	PERSON	's career , putting the emphasis mainly upon his philosophy of life , his writ - ings , and his literary friendships .

		We could wish for a somewhat fuller account of his family life , and this might have been added without enlarging the book unduly .

		Unfor - tunately Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's criticism is vitiated and his whole view of
Symonds	PERSON	's life is biased by his own philosophy of violent individualism .

		This can best be illustrated by his comment on
Cellini	PERSON	.

		`` May it not also be said that , like all true artists ,
Cellini	PERSON	was an ideal man ?

		Transgressing every moral law , he erred only in relation to the social background and it is the task of society , not of the individual , to provide the proper background . ' '

		Society did not , in Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's opinion , provide the proper background for
Symonds	PERSON	.

		His real life was the tragedy of the artist who fails to express himself in art ; and the chief reason for his alleged failure was that he had been put through a `` grinding mill of respectable education '' ; `` he fell out of the hands of his father only to fall into the hands of
Jowett	PERSON	.

		... All the powers that be restrained him , levelled him , coerced him . ''

		If his individ - uality had been properly encouraged by his education , `` he might have left such a perma - nent book as the Opium Confessions or
Amiel	PERSON	's Journal . ''

		As it is , `` the conclusions of
Symonds	PERSON	reduce themselves , upon analysis , to sanity and common sense ; and it appears certain that nothing is more perilous to long life in literature than sanity and common sense when they are not founded upon clair - voyance . ''

		The fallacy of this sort of criti - cism is so obvious as scarcely to need pointing out ; yet no delusions are nowadays more 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	popular than that the best possible education consists in following the slope of one 's inner inclinations , and that the craziest individual vagaries have more literary value than reason and common sense .

		In justice to Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	it should be added that he does not stick con - sistently to his theory , and that he generally furnishes the facts by which the reader may correct his judgments .

		Thus he complains that Professor
Conington	PERSON	was `` a hard man , who tasked
Symonds	PERSON	unmercifully , '' and that in coming under his influence
Symonds	PERSON	`` ex - hibited his unhappy faculty for stumbling into the wrong hands . ' '

		Yet on the next page he says : `` That Conington 's influence , how - ever limited , was most helpful to him ... is proved by his later statement that while Jow - ett taught him to write , Conington taught him to see that ` literature is something by itself , not part of an iridescent nebula . ' '

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	is willing to admit , too , that
Symonds	PERSON	's habit of hard work -LRB- gained in that `` grinding mill of respectable education '' -RRB- often stood him in good stead ; but he does not see that
Symonds	PERSON	's education , by strengthening his moral fibre , probably saved him from becom - ing the victim of ineffectual artistic velleities .

		Finally , it is to Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's credit that he fairly describes the comparative serenity of
Symonds	PERSON	's later view of life , and the fulness and happiness of his last years .

		Symonds 's final attitude is perhaps best expressed in his translation of the prayer of Cleanthes the Stoic , which deserves to be better known : '' Lead thou me , God , Law , Reason , Motion , Life !

		All names for thee alike are vain and hollow : Lead me , for I will follow without strife , Or if I strive , still must I blindly follow . ''

		If the reader can allow for the author 's bias , he will find the book a useful one .

		Unfortu - nately it is not supplied with an index .

Alleyne	PERSON
Ireland	LOCATION	's ``
Joseph Pulitzer	PERSON	: Reminiscences of a Secretary '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- .

		The incidents leading up to Mr.
Ireland	PERSON	's entrance upon his arduous duties , the long and severe testing to which he was pitilessly subjected by the exacting in - valid , and the almost incredible rigors -LRB- in - cluding treatment that was , in its form if not in its spirit , nothing short of abusive and insulting -RRB- that he was expected to bear and apparently did bear with smiling amiability , are related with a calm frankness and cir - cumstantiality that captivate the reader .

		When it is added that the author was only one of half a dozen private secretaries simulta - neously stretched on the rack by the imperious `` J. P. , '' as they styled him among them - selves , it will be seen what a surplus of irritability this brilliantly gifted victim of nervous prostration and other harrowing ail - ments felt himself obliged to work off on those about him .

		That his mind was still in such a condition as to reveal , in spurts and flashes , its astonishing powers of memory and discernment and creative force , is one of the many marvels of his incalculable personality .

		During a quarter-century of physical * disa - bility and of restless roamings in quest of relief from his sufferings Mr.
Pulitzer	PERSON	retained his vigorous control of the great newspaper he had created , and his tyrannical will lit - erally flogged his quailing body to death .

		The book closes with the sudden and not undra - matic termination of the great editor 's hercu - lean labors .

		Coming as the narrative does from one rigorously drilled by Mr.
Pulitzer	PERSON	himself in that scrupulous accuracy in mi - nutest details which he insisted on as the prime essential in all his secretaries and in the edi - torial staff of his journal from one , too , who has evidently studied the clear and con - cise presentation of thought in literary form the book rather startles its readers by dis - playing in its very first chapter a somewhat conspicuous instance of inaccurate and in - consistent statement .

		On page 29 , after ex - plaining that the bridge of the distinguished invalid 's yacht was placed unusually far aft `` to prevent any walking over Mr.
Pulitzer	PERSON	's head when he sat in his library , which was situated under the spot where the bridge would have been in most vessels , '' the author calmly contradicts himself nine lines farther down * by saying that `` immediately under the bridge was Mr.

		To be sure , Mr.

		This dualism , common to all mystics , might , if the poet respects his audience , and why write thus unless he does ?

		Hints of it are plentifully given on every page .

		Red
Hanrahan	PERSON	, whose name in the title shows his leading part in the book , what is he but a personification of the author , and through him of the visionary race of learned Irish poets in general ?

		His quest for eternal beauty leads him after the Sidhe to the loss of his true earthly love , leads him over the world a homeless wanderer feared and cursed by the commonplace and literal , leads him through dreams of the terrors of limbo and of the joys of a shadowy heaven to a lonely deathbed on the moors , poor of mortal com - fort but illuminated by glimpses from the eternal realm of white-armed queens whose eyes `` are blue as ice . ''

		It is all very exqui - sitely suggested , as in the line from the Vision spoken by an Irish Francesca in Hell , whose `` long hair trembled about her as if it lived with some terrible life of its own . ''

		`` It was but the blossom of the man and the woman we loved in one another , the dying beauty of the dust and not the everlasting beauty . ''

		Or again in the word of
Hanrahan	PERSON	on the place of that eternity .

		`` It is very near us that country is ; it may be on the bare hill behind it is , or it may be in the heart of the wood . ''

		The mysticism is completely there , and the `` natural magic '' that expresses it , wherefore the question is a rather weary sigh over the ways of poets who insist on their message wherefore the unnecessary tag ?

		A prosaic label on a fabric of cloudy sunshine and shadow !

		If one were to judge from the definition alone which Professor
Mackenzie	PERSON	gives of a Morality in his `` The English Morality from the Point of View of Allegory '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , one would be inclined to share the general prejudice against this type of play .

		His definition is as follows : `` A Morality is a play , allegorical in structure , which has for its main object the teaching of some lesson for the guidance of life , and in which the principal characters are personified abstractions or highly universalized types . ''

		From the point of view of allegory as well as from that of the ultimate function of these plays as conceived by their makers the moral element was all in all ; but what gives the Morality its merit both as an independent art form and as a phase in the development of the drama is its function as a play .

		It was this element , too , which gave the play its chief contemporary interest .

		So it is that wiien one examines Professor
Mackenzie	PERSON	's list of gen - uine Moralities , as he groups them on the basis of his definition , one finds that twenty-four represent a `` conflict between Virtues and Vices '' and are therefore of the very stuff of Moralities and allegories .

		drama ; that three demonstrate the evil results that follow from yielding to temptation or from making worldly wealth or advancement the object in life , and are thus the predeces - sors of tragedy in its finished form ; that two exhibit the crisis that comes to all who at the end of misspent lives must face death , and of these two `` Everyman '' makes an instant ap - peal to modern audiences ; and , finally , that three deal with religious and political contro - versy , a favorite subject for drama at all times .

		In the course of Professor
Mackenzie	PERSON	's treatment each Morality is considered in de - tail , its plot outlined at some length and its allegorical interpretation somewhat unneces - sarily expounded .

		A chapter is devoted also to miracle plays that have allegorical elements and another to nine plays that have Morality features .

		An excellent discussion of the Moralities considered in relation to their orig - inal audience closes the volume .

		It is not strange that books fol - lofhavriness lowing an established literary tradition in one country are out of their element when translated not merely into a foreign medium but into a foreign mode of thought .

		This is notably true of the essay bearing the misleading title , `` The Science of Happiness , '' by
M. Jean Finot	PERSON	.

		While undoubtedly possessed of some charm in the original , with the inevitable loss of this quality in the translation the volume becomes little more than the rhapsodical reflections of one who has deliberately undertaken a theme and is conscientiously bound to write a book upon it .

		The work is so intently optimistic as to lose all perspective of the vital point at issue .

		Nor does it discuss matters in any more than the usual form of literary allusion and weak philosophic assumptions .

		This judgment may seem severe , and is justified only in terms of the appeal of such a volume to English readers .

		Considered in its native setting , it is an artificial essay without nota - ble message , yet wholly acceptable to ordinary standards of criticism .

Napoleon	PERSON	's victories to an almost supernatural foresight .

		He points out , for example , that in the case of
Champaubert	LOCATION	,
Montmirail	PERSON	, and
Vauchamps	PERSON	much was due to a succession of happy chances .

		Not until the first day 's fighting did
Napoleon	PERSON	become aware how widely separated
Bliicher	PERSON	's corps were .

		The author 's treatment of the final movements of the campaign , when
Napoleon	PERSON	threatened the communications of the allies , is also illu - minating .

		The volume is provided with sev - eral excellent maps and battle plans .

		Mr.
James Ward	PERSON	's new book , `` Color Decoration in Architec - ture ' ' -LRB- Button -RRB- , belongs to a type too common , especially among a certain class of English writers on art .

		The recipe is simple , the making easy : two or three half-understood quotations from
Ruskin	LOCATION	; reproductions of a number of fine things already often published , and of an equal number of the author 's own designs unlikely to be republished ; a few arbitrary and contestable dicta from the writ - er 's experience ; a superficial historical review all padded out by heavy type and wide spacing to a hundred and thirty pages or so , and by thick paper to the semblance of a vol - ume .

		Ruskin 's advice against striping mould - ings in contrasting colors is so unambiguous that it is difficult to see how any man in his senses could make himself believe that such alarming results as those of Plates VI .

		and XI .

		are legitimate exceptions to it ; or to see how any man quoting it with approval could per - petrate such things at all .

		The drawings by
W. Davidson	PERSON	of early color decorations in sev - eral English parish churches , in themselves the best feature of the book , may perhaps be new .

		They are certainly worthy of a separate pub - lication with adequate discussion ; in a brief general book such as Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's they have undue emphasis .

		One or two of the author 's designs , such as the one given in
Plate VIII.	LOCATION	, would be acceptable in such good company ; others , especially in such numbers , serve little purpose but personal advertisement , or rather , betrayal .

		In the absence of anything but rough empirical precepts in the first part of the book , the careless historical notes which follow can furnish little but precedents for blind imitation they are given , it is said indeed , in hopes that they may prove of practi - cal value .

		It is difficult to see how .

		without artistic principles , the author can turn out books on art at such a rate .

		Perhaps , however , it is this very lack of principles which prevents him from compacting his work , and permits him to impose such an unnecessary burden on the public .

		In the `` The Ministry of Art '' ar n cMtecT tlc -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Ralph Adams Cram	PERSON	has collected a series of seven lectures and addresses given by him at intervals during the past few years .

		Being himself an architect of distinction , it is natural that the larger part of his generalizations should deal with architecture rather than the other arts .

		The prevailing note of these ut - terances is highly optimistic an interesting attitude , considering how much we hear about the hopelessness of modern architecture .

		But Mr.
Cram	PERSON	sees limitless and glittering possibili - ties opening before every artist of this day and generation , ' ' a new light on the hills , a new word on the wind , a new joy in the heart . ''

		Being invited to address the
Royal Institute of British Architects	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, in
1912	DATE	, he chose for his subject ``
American University Architecture	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This historical survey , told in a most engaging manner , will seem to many the most valuable chapter in the book , since it interprets definite facts in the light of .

		our civilization and atmosphere .

		It is striking to note this American voice of authority , speak - ing to his fellows overseas , and claiming kin - ship to the monks in the dim monasteries of the Dark Ages , thus : `` Like them , we cherish and conserve all that was great in our greatest past ... leaving to our successors the equal but not more honorable task of voicing in novel and adequate form the new civilization we are helping to create . ' '

		The publishers in their choice of paper , type , and delicate tints in the binding have contributed to the charm of this pleasing volume .

		Modern Biblical scholarship has .

		QSS & y ed to trace th similarities of its traditions with those of
Babylonia	LOCATION	to the Hebrew exile of the sixth century , B. c .

		In fact , this opinion has taken deep root in some quarters .

		But Professor
Morris Jastrow , Jr.	PERSON	, j author of the most com - plete work extant on Babylonian religion , in
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAI , 113 his recent book , `` Hebrew and Babylonian Traditions '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , takes issue squarely with that thesis .

		He concedes the close rela - tion that exists between early Hebrew and Babylonian traditions , but lays down the thesis that these close bonds are not due to any late contact of the two peoples .

		The an - cestor of the Hebrews came from
Babylonia	LOCATION	and carried with him the traditions and beliefs of his forebears .

		Not only so , but many of these traditions were the common property of the early Semites both in
Babylonia	LOCATION	and far - ther west .

		The Babylonian records of the creation , of the sacred garden , of the deluge , are preserved in more than one form .

		Indeed , the inscriptions can be compared word for word with the Biblical stories .

		Their similar - ities are astonishing and establish at once an early relationship .

		But the most startling facts , and those upon which Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	builds his book , are just those in which the traditions totally differ from each other .

		These differences are seen in the significant religious ideas of the two traditions .

		The Hebrew record has been purged of the primitive poly - theism that colors the Babylonian account .

		Its ethics and ideals are all of a far superior order , and bespeak for the Old Testament writers and prophets a loftier conception of the ruler of men and the world , and thus of the people whom they represented .

		Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	has abundantly proved his thesis , and shown wherein the later Hebrew traditions are vastly superior to the other divergent de - velopment seen in Babylonian documents .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The edition of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of En - gland '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- which Professor
Charles Hard	PERSON	- ing
Firth	PERSON	has edited is the first illustrated edition .

		Three of the six volumes have now been published .

		They give evidence that the body of illustrations to be drawn upon for
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's narrative is an especially rich one .

		Professor
Firth	PERSON	has been able to secure unusually fine photographs of pictures from the
Sutherland Collection	ORGANIZATION	, the National Por - trait Gallery , and from many private sources .

		A number are excellently reproduced in color .

		Four new volumes have just come to hand in the `` Everyman 's Library '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		They are Dr.
Elizabeth Blackwell	PERSON	's autobiography , `` Pioneer Work for Women , '' with an introduction by Mrs.
M. G. Fawcett	PERSON	;
Colley Cibber	PERSON	's `` Apology for His Life , '' prefaced by the appreciation of
Hazlitt	PERSON	;
James A. Froude	PERSON	's '' The Life of Benjamin Dis - raeli '' ; and
Frederic Seebohm	PERSON	's '' The Oxford Reformers . ''

		All these books are worth reprinting for one reason and another , and the first , in par - ticular , is a record of courage and intelligence deserving of wide circulation .

August 16 , 1914	DATE	-LRB- From a Review in the `` Minneapolis Journal '' -RRB- Lincoln as He Was The
Everyday Life of Abraham Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	.


Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Publishers	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		* TpHE material for this work , which was originally published
thirty years ago	DATE	, A was collected from more than five hundred of the friends and contemporaries of
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		So much has been written on the subject during the last generation that any new issue in the field owes an apology for its existence .

		The manner in which the present volume was prepared constitutes a more than sufficient apology .

		Here an attempt has been made to present Lincoln , the man , rather than
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the tradition ; and the result might be characterized as an anecdotal life . ''

		It can not be doubted that the traditional Lincoln , as usually presented to school children , and which has become fixed in the mind of the average adult , is a rather highly sentimentalized concept .

		All the tremendous and tragic circum - stances surrounding the man were admirably suited to act as a distorting medium .

		A long and exhausting war is conducive to popular hysteria , as a result of which even the most level-headed men are likely to overstate ; and the tragic death would tend to stifle the colder , more detached criticism .

		Added to these circumstances was the powerful appeal to humanitarian idealism involved in the emancipation of slaves . ''

		In the greater number of writings on Lincoln , one can not but note an almost total lack of the sober critical faculty .

		All witnesses seem to have vied with each other in exaltation .

		Nearly all testimony has a suspicious note of emotional abandon in it .

		It will probably never be possible entirely to separate the tradi - tional from the factual ; but that critical-minded historian of the future who shall write the fairest possible appraisal of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's character shall be obliged to make use of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's volume ; and therein lies its chief value as a source .

		Nor need any American patriot fear the result of that colder criticism which is inevitable .

		The present volume , in which
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is much less of a sad demi-god than in the conventional representations , shows how much greater a man may be in fact than in sentimental tradition . ''

		Here is shown plainly , what has never been a secret and yet is persistently ignored , that
Lincoln	PERSON	held out as long as possible against those who urged the abolition of slavery , issuing his proclamation only as a last desperate means of subduing the South .

		It was the master-stroke of a wise opportunist rather than the exalted deed of a humanitarian .

		And yet millions of children have been led to believe that the war was primarily a war against the institution of slavery , and that
Lincoln	LOCATION	- 's chief concern was with the freeing of slaves .

		Truly , he was opposed to slavery , but he constantly placed the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	above abolition , believing that the latter should be accomplished by a slow process of purchase and colonization .

		That he thus proved his far-sightedness is apparent now when the negro question has become an issue of grave importance .

		There is much in the evidence here presented to indicate that , had he lived through the Eeconstruction period , the negro would have been dealt with in a much more prac - tical way than that of the high-handed ultra-humanitarians who insisted upon regarding the negro as an Anglo-Saxon with a black skin . ''

		Furthermore , we here see Lincoln as a possible human being , capable of losing patience , capable of petulance and anger , capable of making mistakes .

		And inasmuch as he is made to appear more the man and less the demi-god , by so much he looms the bigger and is the more intelligible to men . ''

		Why is it that English novels are better than American novels !

		It will readily be replied that the audience to which the serious literary artist may appeal is much larger in
England	LOCATION	than in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		But this reply does not take into account the fact that the better English novelists find at least half their audience in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This was true at least as long ago as the time when
Greorge Meredith	PERSON	was trying to find a public .

		He took comfort in his American readers , who , he said , were the first to pay him the tribute of buying his books in considerable numbers .

		It is true now , when novelists like Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, and Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	have quite as many admirers on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as on the other .

		At this point it will be replied that audiences have nothing to do with the matter while individual artists have everything to do with it .

		Perhaps this is the reply of wisdom .

		But there is an eco - nomic consideration to be noted .

		The actual demand in the two English - speaking countries may be the same ; the method of supply is not .

		The
United States	LOCATION	is above all others the country of the maga - zine .

		It has been said , doubtless with a touch of exaggeration , that the
United States	LOCATION	pro- duces more magazines than all the other coun - tries of the civilized world together .

		Other countries produce books .

		Even
Japan	LOCATION	pub - lishes six or seven times as many books per capita as does the
United States	LOCATION	.


England	LOCATION	, though it is second only to the
United States	LOCATION	in the profusion of its periodicals , is still a country of book-readers .

		There are some - thing like ten times as many books published in
England	LOCATION	as in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The re - sult is that novels are written in
England	LOCATION	for readers of books ; in the
United States	LOCATION	for readers of magazines .

		Possibly the American temperament if there is such a thing is by nature devoted to the magazine and not to the book .

		Possi - bly the tremendous production of magazines in this country is an expression of the race which occupies it .

		But it seems more probable that an accident in the shape of the second - class postage rates has been the potent factor 126 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	in building up the magazine at the expense of the book .

		At any rate there is no denying that in the past thirty years and more the government regulations have been much more favorable to the magazine business than to the book business .

		It has apparently been more profitable to supply the demand for reading matter in the form of weekly or monthly periodicals than in the form of single volumes .

		It goes for nothing that hardly one in a dozen American novels is actually published serially in a magazine .

		The point is that not one in a dozen American novels is written re - gardless of the possibilities of serial publica - tion .

		It would be strange if many of them were written regardless of these very concrete possibilities .

		Serial publication offers , in addi - tion to the book royalties , from
$ 500	MONEY	to
$ 5000	MONEY	to the fortunate author who secures it for his novel .

		What we say to our American novel - ists is this : Write the kind of novel that can be printed in a magazine before it is printed in a book , and we will pay you a bonus of , say ,
$ 2500	MONEY	.

		England says nothing of the kind .

		The English magazines use fewer serials than do ours and pay far less for those they do use .

		The limitations of magazine publication are patent enough .

		A magazine is dependent on finding a large public and finding it quickly .

		The circulation of such a weekly as the ``
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post '' or such a monthly as the `` Cosmopolitan '' is practically outside the possibilities of the circulation of novels when the element of time is taken into ac - count .

		And the magazines which print fic - tion but which have not achieved such a circulation as either of the two we have men - tioned endeavor to get just such a circulation .

		There are a few apparent exceptions ; but we venture to say that there is not a magazine of high quality published in the
United States	LOCATION	which has not refused serial publication to a novel for the reason that the editor did not dare to print it .

		Success , even success of prestige , means catering to the tastes and deferring to the prejudices of the more conventional and the less appreciative minds among the hundreds of thousands of possible readers .

		It means appealing to the lowest common denominator .

		If in the case of one magazine the lowest com - mon denominator is that of the millions who have lacked either the natural endowment or the opportunity necessary to develop intelli - gent appreciation and in the case of another the lowest common denominator is that of the tens of thousands of `` educated persons '' the principle is the same .

		Cases might be cited in which the first condition produced a more re - spectable work of art than the second !

		But this is not all .

		It is not only that mag - azine fiction must please -LRB- and especially must not offend -RRB- the majority .

		The limitations of the serial form are peculiarly cramping to the genius of the novel .

		If the novel is anything it is loose .

		Fine novels have been written which were not loose .

		But always the novel has returned to looseness .

		Any critically selected list of the dozen great novels would be unusual if it contained two that were writ - ten to a formal pattern .

		But no pattern ever chosen by an artist in fiction is as elaborate as that to which the serial is pressed to ad - just itself .

		No artist would ever willingly choose to produce one climax after another at brief intervals in his narrative and no artist would ever ask that his narrative be read in instalments .

		Finally , no artist would suggest that fifty thousand words be cut out of the middle of his novel as was done by an American editor in the case of one of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's recent books .

		It may be objected that the disadvantages of serial publication are in process of disap - pearance .

		Some commentators in sharp disagreement with the rest of us have found a new willingness in certain magazines to deal frankly with sex or with the industrial ma - jority or with some other matter subject to taboo .

		At least one writer has developed a formula for writing fiction in which situa - tions intended to titillate are cautiously re - solved in a manner calculated to appease Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	.

		His freedom , however new or old .

		is a freedom that no artist ever wanted and that no artist ever took : it is a freedom to lie .

		The difficulties of serial publication are inherent difficulties .

		They may be modified but they can never be abrogated .

		To say , then , that
America	LOCATION	is the country of the serial while
England	LOCATION	is the country of the novel is to say that
America	LOCATION	is the home of Mr.
Booth Tarkington	PERSON	and Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	and Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	while
England	LOCATION	is the home of Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	and Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
John Gals	PERSON	- worthy .

		Or is it ?

		Is the comparison wholly fair ? ''

		If it is not fair it is because the accident
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 127 of birth is a factor .

		The individual artist does supremely count .

		He does find his way in spite of the difficulties .

		We believe quite simply that if there is a young man of genius for the art of fiction in the
United States	LOCATION	to-day nothing but sudden death will prevent him from speaking to us in his own fashion regardless of the demands of serial publica - tion .

		But if the comparison is partly fair it is because novels such as some six or a dozen English writers have been giving us are -LRB- with an exception or two to be noted a generation from now -RRB- the product of talent rather than of genius , the result of honest intelligence and sturdy craftsmanship rather than of any spark of the divine fire .

		And to talent the conditions of life and of publication they are nearly the same thing do truly matter .

		A nation which bribes its young writers to do clever serials rather than sound novels is forced to wait long not only for that represen - tation of its manners which it is the novelist 's business to furnish , but also for that imag - inative interpretation of its life which it is his privilege to make .

		PICTURES AND WORDS .

		We remember seeing not long ago in a news - paper a group of eight small pictures which admirably briefed or summarized one of the novels of Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	.

		Underneath them was the legend `` Why read novels ? ''

		It did seem superfluous in the face of such short - hand .

		But in books and magazines the illus - trations seem to be getting the upper hand of what is illustrated .

		Newspapers are be - coming a mass of photographs from life with merely a trickle of commenting text .

		People seem to go through business and games , to per - form heroic deeds , to get married or hanged , not for any interest in these things themselves , but simply as an excuse for posing before a camera .

		And then there are the Moving Pic - tures !

		We have had many a special wonder in the way of inventions to overcome us in recent years , the telegraph , the telephone , wireless , the bicycle , the automobile but none of these is more miraculous in essence or has spread over the world so instantaneously as the Mov - ing Pictures .

		Events have been taught to record themselves , so that
Time	ORGANIZATION	seems to merge into Eternity .

		Yesterday is abolished !

		The Theatre , too , as it has existed from the beginning of the world , seems in a fair way to be abolished .

		Like a myriad-armed octopus the Moving Picture business seems to be grasp - ing the players and the playhouses in its grasp .

		To the players it offers a simultaneous exhibi - tion of themselves at a hundred , perhaps a thousand places .

		To the public it offers a cheaper entertainment than has ever been known before .

		It is curious to hear people in remote villages discussing the merits of Mr.
Bosworth	PERSON	or Mr.
Bunny	PERSON	, as the inhabitants of cities used to talk of Booth or Irving .

		We may dislike to see the drama `` flicker down to brainless pantomime '' ; we may object to have the theatre poet and the novelist turned into makers of dumb-show scenarios .

		But the new art is not on probation ; it is overwhelmingly triumphant .

		And as a means of education , as a substitute for travel , even as a subsidiary form of enter - tainment , it has proved its value .

		But we do not believe that the impressions it makes are deep or permanent .

		We do not believe its excitements will ever rival those of the great arts .

		`` I go to the Moving Pictures because I do n't have to think , '' said an acquaintance to us .

		The `` tired business man '' has dictated the course of the drama for a good while , and apparently he now has something that suits him .

		better .

		But an art which eliminates thinking and , to a great extent , sympathetic emotion is not likely to go far .

		When photog - raphy itself was first introduced it was gen - erally thought that the death-warrant of the artist had been signed .

		But photography has been found a brainless and soulless substitute for the thinking mind , the creative hnd .

		Picture writing is probably the oldest of the graphic arts .

		To represent things and ideas by symbols certainly antedates the rep - resentation of them by words .

		And always among the ignorant or undeveloped the pic - torial art assumes immense importance .

		Chil - dren get their first education from picture books .

		When reading was almost a hieratic art as among the ancient Hindus , Persians , and Egyptians , or among Europeans a few hundred years ago , pictures were almost the only means of impressing religious or histor - ical notions upon the masses .

		Perhaps it would be truer to say that only since the in - vention of printing has the universal reign of the word come in .

		It is only natural then that the people should catch at the visible repre - sentation of things and actions when it is offered them .

		The partial eclipse of words , however , is a serious threat to intelligence .

		Speech is man 's highest prerogative ; language is his all-con - quering weapon .

		Nations trained , either by the spoken drama or the printed book , in the use of noble , significant , and delicate language , 128 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	are certainly likely to be more civilized and powerful than if they should be content to get ideas flashed upon their brains by the means of pictures .

		Imagine the effect upon an audience of the presentation of '' The School for Scandal '' in pictures ; all the wit and malicious phrase and delineation of hu - man nature left out , and nothing given but the dumb show of the scenes !

		Or `` As You Like It '' or `` Macbeth '' produced with all their poetry and infinite suggestion of lan - guage omitted .

		Then imagine this method ap - plied to all plays past , present , or to come , and surely it would breed a race of unparalleled stupidity .

		Spectacle the Moving Pictures can give , though certainly not with the effective - ness of figures and masses in the round , fixed , or moving in real space and distance .

		The coarser and more violent kind of action they can give ; but violence seems almost a neces - sity as it is in pantomime .

		The exhibition of finer shades of feeling and thought , of matters interior and spiritual , must be abandoned .

		The Moving Pictures produce something like the same effect as witnessing the performance of a play in an unknown language .

		We re - member seeing
Salvini	PERSON	in `` King Lear , '' and , though of course familiar with the play , the lack of instant recognition of the spoken word made us feel that the great actor was a Jew peddler trying to sell
Goneril	LOCATION	a bill of goods .

		Of course our whole criticism is predicated on the idea that the Moving Picture shows are pushing the real Theatres aside , are taking over to themselves the entertainment and in - struction of the great masses .

		There could be no possible objection to them if they were kept in proper subordination .


Charles Reade	PERSON	, who always held a brief for the Theatre , in one of his stories rebukes a young poet for imagining that certain of his lines have merit in themselves apart from the intonation and look of the actress who utters them .

		The lines '' ` er my bowed head , though waves of sorrow roll , I still retain the empire of my soul '' have merit and we can hardly imagine any elocution or gesture which would improve them .

		On the other hand , critics have debated whether really great dramas can ever be acted up to the idea which we form in reading them .

		Charles Lamb de - nied that `` King Lear '' could be adequately performed and deprecated the bringing of it upon the stage as a desecration .

		How much less satisfactory , then , must be the perfor - mance of any play with language , which is its very soul , omitted .

		One cause of the immense success of the
Moving Pictures	ORGANIZATION	is their realism .

		The real pump upon the stage has always been a joy to mankind ; how much more then must it thrill when it can have real locomotives going at real speed , real collisions , real battles , mur - ders , and all the incidents of moving life .

		Plato condemned poetry because the actual world being the mere shadow of the primal Ideas , the poet was working at second hand and giving an imitation of an imitation .

		But
Plato	PERSON	was probably wrong .

		The poet , work - ing from the materials furnished him by nature , seems to reassemble them into some - thing that approaches the God-sprung Ideas .

		As has often been pointed out , Achilles is truer and more potent than
Alexander	PERSON	, Hamlet than
Charles V.	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Rich - ard III .

		than the actual tyrant of
England	LOCATION	.

		Passing through the alembic of a poet 's mind these figures have acquired a validity and uni - versality that they did not have in life .

		Nay , we will go farther and say that natural scenes rarely come up to the concentrated images of them presented us by the poets .

		Has anybody but
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	ever seen `` Jocund day Stand tiptoe on the misty mountain top '' ... ?

		Has anyone ever got from an actual oak wood such a rush of impressions , such a sense of multitudinous power as
Keats	PERSON	furnishes in the following lines ' ? ''

		As when upon a tranced
summer	DATE	night Those green robed senators of ancient woods , Tall oaks , branch charmed by the earnest stars , Dream , and so dream all night without a stir , Save from some gradual solitary gust , Which comes upon the silence and dies off As if the ebbing air had but one wave . ''

		Art betters nature by importing into it the joys and fears and passions of mankind ; by joining together remote things in unforeseen similitude ; by giving us at once the object itself and its profound meaning .

		And art works this magic more potently by the use of words than by any other method at its dis - posal .

		So far as we have got in the history of the world words are the most lasting , if not the only lasting things .

		Language , frailer , more immaterial than cobwebs , lives when every - thing else perishes .

		In the hands of men en - tirely great as
Bulwer	PERSON	's Richelieu observes , it conquers the conquering sword .

		It covers and outreaches all the other arts .

		It expresses ideas , which music can not do .

		It records ac - tions in time , which sculpture does not , and in space where stationary painting , at least , fails .

		It can give us impressions of color and call up sensations of taste .

		The Moving Pictures , having got rid of this great intermediary of language , give us real -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 129 ity raw from the shambles of life .

		Of course the scenarios require a certain amount of pre - paratory planning and the acting a modicum of art .

		In a way the business is a culmination of the realistic movements in literature and art of modern times , and it serves the inau - gurators of these movements right to have the guiding reins taken out of their hands .

		The egotism of human beings always tends to push idealistic and significant art aside for what is seemingly literal representation , and the Mov - ing Pictures cater to this egotism .

		We are afraid the business will have to run its course and will result in an indefinite postponement of a really great literary , dramatic , and pic - torial rebirth in our modern world .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A PROTEST AGAINST UNREASON will have weight only with the reasonable .

		Nevertheless it is to be hoped that even in this mad age Mr.
Ralph Norman Angell Lane	PERSON	's `` Arms and Industry '' -LRB- discussed at greater length on another page -RRB- , a worthy sequel to `` The Great Illusion , '' will cause some salutary thinking .

		At the very close of his very timely book , after speaking of the cessation of religious wars in the civilized world , he adds : `` So with con - flicts between the political groups .

		They arise from a corresponding conception of the rela - tion of military authority to political ends those ends for which governments are founded the protection of life and property , the pro- motion of well-being .

		When it is mutually realized by the parties concerned that security of life and property , like the security of truth , is not derived from military force ; that mili - tary force is as ineffective , as irrelevant , to the end of promoting prosperity as of promoting truth , then political wars will cease , as relig - ious wars have ceased , for the same reason and in the same way . ''

		How this change in the world 's mental attitude , in what it agrees to regard as common sense , is to come about , may perhaps be in a rough way conjectured from another paragraph of the same chapter . ' '

		Two hundred and fifty years ago an educated man , with a lawyer 's knowledge of the rules of evidence , condemned an old woman to death for changing herself into a cow or a goat .

		Ask a ten-year-old boy of our time whether he thinks it likely that an old woman would or could change herself into a cow or a goat , and he will almost always promptly reply , ` Cer - tainly not . '

		... What enables the unlearned boy to decide right where the learned judge decided wrong ?

		You say it is the ` instinct ' of the boy .

		But the instinct of the seventeenth - century boy -LRB- like the learning of the seven - teenth-century judge -RRB- taught him the exact reverse .

		Something has happened .

		What is it ? ''

		Obviously , as the author points out , it is the unconscious application of the inductive method of reasoning , and the general frame of mind consequent upon that mode of reasoning .

		It is not beyond hope that the absurdity of war will one day be as patent as the absurdity of witchcraft .

		... TRANSLATED WRITINGS OF JOSE RIZAL , the Philippine patriot , hero , and martyr , as his compatriots are fond of calling him , and the gifted author of noted works in prose and verse , are brought to our attention in the
June	DATE	`` Bulletin of the Philippine Library . ''

		Of these products of his pen , the best known are the novel , `` Noli Me Tangere , '' translated by Mr.
Charles Derbyshire	PERSON	under the title , `` The Social Cancer , '' and the poem , `` Mi Ultimo Pensamiento , '' known in English as `` My Last Thoughts . ''

		Versions of the novel and of the poem are numerous in other languages also . ' '

		El
Filibusterismo	PERSON	' ' is another popular novel of
Rizal	LOCATION	's , turned into English by Mr.
Derby	PERSON	- shire under the title , `` The Reign of Greed . ''

		Other works of his procurable in our tongue are cited : `` By Telephone , '' `` The Monkey and the Tortoise : a
Tagalog	LOCATION	Tale , '' `` The Philippines a Century Hence , '' with other writings by
Rizal	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' The Indolence of the Fili - pino , ' ' and ' ' Elias and Salome . ' '

		The
Philip	LOCATION	- pine Education Publishing Company of
Manila	LOCATION	appears to be the publisher of all or most of these works , though an abridged adaptation of the `` Noli '' was issued in
1901	DATE	by
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title , `` An Eagle Flight . ''

		Books about
Rizal	ORGANIZATION	, pub - lished by the
Manila	LOCATION	house already referred to , are as follows : ' ' Lineage , Life , and Labors of
Jose Rizal	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Austin Craig	PERSON	; `` The Story of
Jose Rizal	PERSON	, the Greatest Man of the
Brown	PERSON	Race , '' a shorter memoir from the same pen ; and ' ' Rizal , the Filipino Patriot , ' ' by Mr.
Craig	PERSON	and
Miss Mary H. Fee	ORGANIZATION	.

		This last appeared serially in `` Philippine Education , '' and may not be procurable in book form .

		Fur - ther translations from
Rizal	LOCATION	, and among them `` The Vision of
Friar Rodriguez	PERSON	, '' are con - templated by Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, who is certainly doing his part to spread the fame of this `` greatest man of the brown race . ' '

		THE MARTIAL MUSE , from the time of Tyrtceus , the lame , schoolmaster , kindling by his rude lines the Spartans to brave deeds in their war with the Messenians , in the seventh century before our era , has given to the world much stirring verse and some that is of an 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	excellence little short of the highest .

		It is too early to look for any considerable poetic prod - uct from the present European conflict , but a notable sonnet from Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	's pen has already reached our shores by cable to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		We take the liberty to reprint this clear-toned message from one of the most earnest of pacifists . ''

		Thus only should it have come , if come it must , Not with a riot of flags , or a mob-born cry , But with a noble faith , a conscience high And pure and proud as heaven , wherein we trust .

		We who have fought for Peace have dared the thrust Of calumny for Peace and watched her die , Her ` scutcheons rent from sky to outraged sky By felon hands , and trampled into dust . ''

		It is God 's answer .

		Though for many a year This land forgot the faith that made her great , Now , as her fleets cast off the North Sea foam , Casting aside all faction and all fear , Thrice armed in all the majesty of her fate ,
Britain	LOCATION	remembers , and her sword strikes home . ''

		Another sonnet born of the war and likewise communicated to the above-named journal comes from Mr. ``
William Watson	PERSON	.

		It is ad - dressed , in taunting accents , to ' ' The Troubler of the World , ' ' and begins : '' At last we know you , War Lord .

		You that flung The gauntlet down , fling down the mask you wore . ''

		It ends : '' And not by earth shall he be soon forgiven Who set the fire accurst that flames to-day . ''

		The silence of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	at this juncture , when a warlike strain from his lyre would naturally have been expected , is cause for wonder ... AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SOURCE OF SINEWY EN - GLISH , as has been repeatedly pointed out in the past , and will be , we hope , repeatedly pointed out in the future , is the
King James	PERSON	version of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		In the literature that is nearer in time than we are to the makers of that version , it is a pleasure to note the evident influence of the biblical style upon the phraseology of many of the best writers .

		Opening at random
Izaak Walton	PERSON	's `` Lives , '' we chance upon the following reference to the unworthy spouse foisted upon
Richard Hooker	PERSON	by the artful Mrs.
Churchman	PERSON	: `` Now , the wife provided for him was her daughter
Joan	PERSON	, who brought him neither beauty nor portion ; and for her conditions , they were too like that wife 's , which is by Solomon compared to a dripping house : so that the good man had no reason to rejoice in the wife of his youth ; but too just cause to say with the holy Prophet , Wo is me , that I am constrained to have my habitation in the tents of Kedar ! ''

		Why can we no longer write in this vigorous and at the same time picturesque fashion ?

		Mr.
Joseph S. Auerbach	PERSON	, in a recent extended essay on ' ' The Bible and Modern Life , ' ' pleads for a return to the Bible both as a book of religious truth and as a literary model ; and he incidentally calls attention to
Lincoln	LOCATION	's well-known indebtedness to the Scriptures for his strong and admirably idiomatic style as a writer and speaker .

		The
Gettysburg	LOCATION	oration , as he remarks , is thickly sprinkled with `` words of Bible memory '' and `` phrases born of Bible reading and Bible inspiration . ''

		Among them he notes the following : four - score , conceived , brought forth , dedicated , consecrated , gave their lives that that nation might live , hallow , resting-place , increased de - votion , last full measure , unfinished work , long endure , resolve , new birth , perish from the earth .

		Take these away , and `` much of the solemn music has died out forever from this inspiring Battle Hymn of consecration to the Republic . ''

		... MEMENTOES OF GEORGE BORROW are desired for the enrichment of the museum into which the Borrow house at
Norwich	LOCATION	has been turned since the late celebration there in his honor .

		A curious contrast is presented by the two marked personalities that are , in the minds of many of us , associated most intimately with the shire town of
Norfolk	LOCATION	,
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	and
James Martineau	PERSON	.

		And the contrast is heightened and made to take on a somewhat comical aspect by the image of young Borrow undergoing disciplinary treatment at the hands of the schoolmaster while the unwilling
Martineau	PERSON	fills the office of flogging-horse , a disservice that the castigated one never forgot and never forgave .

		But it is not to this inci - dent that attention is now called .

		The city librarian of
Norwich	LOCATION	, Mr.
George A. Stephen	PERSON	, asks publicity for the following : `` On the occasion of the
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	celebration in
Norwich	LOCATION
last year	DATE	, the house in which Borrow resided with his parents when in
Norwich	LOCATION	was acquired by Mr.
A. M. Samuel	PERSON	-LRB- then lord mayor of
Norwich	LOCATION	-RRB- and presented by him to the
Norwich Corporation	ORGANIZATION	with the view of its being maintained as a
Borrow Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Norwich Public Library Committee	ORGANIZATION	has just undertaken to collaborate in the development of the literary side of the museum , and would therefore gladly welcome donations or infor - mation respecting the whereabouts of any Borrow letters and manuscripts , engravings , or photographs of Borrow 's friends and places described in his works , and other items of Borrovian interest . ' '

		Communications may be addressed to Mr.
Stephen	PERSON	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 131 EASILY DISCOURAGED LIBRARY-USERS , who , after a feeble attempt to profit by the wealth of printed matter placed at their disposal , abandon the enterprise and are seen no more in the halls of literature , are known to every librarian .

		`` These are some of my trials , '' whined the wealthy host to his guest ,
John Wesley	PERSON	, when the fire in the grate refused to burn and the smoke came out into the room .

		Some of the trials of faint-hearted book - borrowers in
St. Louis	LOCATION	have been inquired into by Dr.
Bostwick	PERSON	, as narrated in his current yearly Report of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		A thousand printed cards of inquiry , with return cards attached , were sent to as many addresses , asking the reason or reasons for failure to re-register and continue in the enjoyment of the library 's privileges .

		Only six hundred and eleven of these cards reached the persons addressed , and only one hundred and eight elicited replies .

		Excuses ranged from the unanswerable one of death through the valid ones of removal from the city and ill health , down to the frivolous pretexts of `` dislike of shelf arrangement , '' `` too much picture-show , '' and `` too many steps to climb to enter building . ''

		It is true the fine new library building at
St. Louis	LOCATION	, with its impos - ing facade and majestic flights of steps , is rather formidable of approach to the aged , the rheumatic , and the otherwise deficient in loco - motive agility .

		Let the little wayside libraries and deposit stations of the rural districts be thankful for their easy accessibility and deprecate the assumption of any such
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	magnificence and stateliness as might repel rather than invite the true lover of books and reading for their own sake .

		HUMORS OF A DUCAL CORRESPONDENCE are faintly glimpsed in an entry that we open to by chance in the catalogue and price-list of autograph letters and manuscripts for sale by
Messrs. Maggs Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, at 109 Strand , Lon - don .

		Item
1553	DATE	is a collection of letters be - tween members of the ducal family of
Leeds	LOCATION	, and among them are mentioned thirty-six mis - sives from
Peregrine	ORGANIZATION	, the second Duke , to his wife
Bridget	PERSON	.

		`` All of them , '' we are assured , `` are most affectionate letters ... discussing the public and private affairs with which he was engaged and domestic matters : in several most pathetically acknowledging his worth - lessness , begging forgiveness , and promising better conduct in the future , which promises were apparently never kept , to judge from the several similar letters . ''

		This penitent Pere - grine , who never got beyond vain remorse for his repeated lapses from virtue , is the subject of certain passages in five letters from the injured wife `` to her mother and father-in - law concerning the bad behaviour of her hus - band , the management of his estate , and her plans for the marriage of her son , and other things . ''

		All that took place two centuries ago , the actors have been dead and forgotten nearly as long , the paper on which the domes - tic drama is written must be yellowed with time , and the ink faded ; but think how real and tear-compelling and laughter-provoking the various incidents of that family tragi - comedy must once have been .

		The autograph record of
Peregrine	ORGANIZATION	's peccadilloes is to be had , let us inform the reader , for fifteen guineas .

		THE LIBRARY AS A PROMOTER OF REFORM Can exert a powerful influence throughout its com - munity .

		Conspicuous for its activity in this respect is the
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- Public Library , with its monthly `` house organ , '' `` The Newarker , '' as its mouthpiece in advocacy of all kinds of civic betterment .

		Its recent espousal of the cause of the shade-tree has doubtless tended to the beautification of the city 's streets and the
summer	DATE	comfort of its citizens .

		In
Boston	LOCATION	at the present time a lively campaign , instituted by the
Chamber of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, is in progress in the interest of safety to life and limb in the city 's crowded thoroughfares .

		Doubtless the local libraries are doing something , through the distribution of reading matter , to save a few lives and pre - vent a few bumps and bruises and broken limbs while , it is to be noted with depreca - tion and abhorrence , all
Europe	LOCATION	seems bent on a programme involving the senseless slaughter of thousands and .

		the maiming of as many more .

		At
Chippewa Falls	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Wis.	LOCATION	-RRB- the public library has lately given its aid to the outward purification of the city for its inner or spir - itual refinement it has , of course , always labored .

		A Clean City Day was celebrated , and patrons of the library found in the books they borrowed reminders of their duty in the form of bookmarks containing timely admoni - tions headed by the words , `` Fly Catechism , '' or `` Fly Hints , '' or `` Ten Commandments Regarding Open Lots , '' or other similar cap - tions .

		The grand truth that no man , not even a librarian , liveth to himself , is impressing itself on our library workers in a manner un - dreamt-of in the past by a Magliabecchi , a
Naude	ORGANIZATION	, a
Panizzi	LOCATION	, an
Edwards	ORGANIZATION	, or even by a Winsor or a
Spofford	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE BELGIANS OF CESAR 'S `` COMMENTA - RIES , '' as some readers will have been reminded by the course of recent events in western
Europe	LOCATION	, were the bravest of the Gallic tribes ; or , in the familiar language of the original , 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	' ' Horum omnium f ortissimi sunt Belgae , prop - terea quod a cultu atque humanitate provin - ciae longissime absunt , minimeque ad eos mer - catores saepe commeant , atque ea , quae ad effeminandos animos pertinent , important ; proximique sunt Germanis , qui trans Rhenum incolunt , quibuseumque continenter bellum gerunt . ''

		And on a later page -LRB- book two , chapter four -RRB- we learn : ' ' Plerosque Belgas esse ortos ab Germanis , Rhenumque antiquitus transductos propter loci fertilitatem ibi con - sedisse ,
Gallosque	PERSON	, qui ea loca incolerent , expulisse , solosque esse , qui patrum nostrorum memoria , omni Gallia vexata ,
Teutones Cim	ORGANIZATION	- brosque intra fines suos ingredi prohibuerint . ' '

		In other words , when the Teutons of that day , together with the Cimbrians , wished to enter the Belgian territory in arms , in defiance of international law , the sturdy Belgians with - held their consent and gave the said
Teutons	PERSON	and Cimbrians convincing proof of their deter - mination not to be intimidated or overrun by any arrogantly assertive military power from beyond the
Rhine	LOCATION	.

		`` Sicut patribus , sit Deus nobis ! ' '

		might well be the watchword at
Liege	LOCATION	and
Namur	LOCATION	and
Brussels	LOCATION	and
Antwerp	LOCATION	in these days ... SUMMER WORK OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY is always much diminished in volume as com - pared with winter 's strenuous tasks .

		Long , dreamy afternoons for the reading of poetry and romance , the building of air-castles , the planning of ideal libraries for ideal communi - ties , and indulgence in other fascinating pas - times , are at this season not unknown to the custodian of the people 's books .

		Other and more active and perhaps , in respect to visible results , more profitable employment of the time is also not unknown .

		At the
Minneapolis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , the librarian goes out and hunts for work when work fails to come to her .

		We read in the Report for last year : '' During the
summer	DATE	months the library was , to a large extent , a public reading room only .

		Much time was then spent by the librarian in visiting the homes to get the par - ents ' signature for the children 's cards .

		Many of the parents either do not understand the need of going to the library for such a pur - pose , or will not take the time or trouble to do so .

		Beginning with
October	DATE	, there was a steady increase in circulation of more and better books .

		Children , especially , got over the idea of just taking a book home for some - thing to carry , so the ` other fellow ' would see that he or she could have a library card also .

		The length of time they keep the books grows longer ; over half the books that are issued one day do not now return the next .

		They are really read , and not simply carried home as a novelty . ''

		Perhaps there may be here a seed-corn of suggestion for other libraries and librarians .

		A POEM 's CENTENNIAL is to be celebrated at
Baltimore	LOCATION	this month with an unexampled series of musical , memorial , oratorical , spec - tacular , aquatic , athletic , and other perform - ances , in the presence of a brilliant assemblage from far and near .

		For a week and a day -LRB- Sept. 6-13 -RRB- the writing of `` The Star - Spangled Banner ' ' a century ago will be com - memorated and appropriate tribute paid to its author ,
Francis Scott Key	PERSON	, though many of the exercises announced on the programme are of a nature little related to poetry of any sort , but of a variety that promises something attractive to all who may attend .

		Parades of various sorts , an abundance of oratory , un - veilings and dedications , historical pageant , a ball , a water carnival , and , finally , a `` peace day '' will fill to overflowing the week set apart for this memorable celebration .

		In the dis - play of objects of historical interest at the
Peabody Galleries	ORGANIZATION	will be found the original manuscript of Key 's famous verses , now the precious possession of Mr.
Henry Walters	PERSON	, and also a copy of the broadside or hand-bill that first showed the verses to the public in print .

		Chief among the pilgrimages planned to outlying places of interest will be that to
Frederick	PERSON	, birthplace and burial place of this patriotic son of `` the land of the free and the home of the brave . ' '

		WHY WOMEN DO NOT BUY MORE BOOKS IS psychologically explained or , at least , an explanation is attempted by Dr.
Otto Weininger	PERSON	in his recent remarkable work , `` Sex and Character . ''

		After proving , to his own satisfaction , that women have no souls except so far as they possess male attributes and hence are not genuine women , he says , in a chapter on male and female psychology : `` If a woman possessed an ` ego ' she would have the sense of property both in her own case and that of others .

		The thieving instinct , however , is much more developed in men than in women .

		So-called ` kleptomaniacs ' -LRB- those who steal without necessity -RRB- are almost exclu - sively women .

		Women understand power and riches , but not personal property .

		When the thefts of female kleptomaniacs are discovered , the women defend themselves by saying that it appeared to them as if everything belonged to them .

		It is chiefly women who use circu - lating libraries , especially those who could quite well afford to buy quantities of books ; but , as a matter of fact , they are not more strongly attracted by what they have bought
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJL 133 than by what they have borrowed . ''

		Library workers have long noted that women borrow - ers far outnumber men borrowers , and they will now doubtless be glad to know the reason .

		THE FASCINATION OF FORBIDDEN FICTION , the fiction banned by the public library , is well known to be all but irresistible .

		Likewise the restriction placed upon novel-borrowing by nearly all public libraries , a restriction limit - ing each card-holder to one work of prose fiction at a time , generates a vehement desire for two or more , so that any removal of this bar would seem to threaten a speedy emptying of the fiction shelves , or at least the shelves of newer fiction , at the hands of the eager novel - readers .

		But what actually results when the limitation is done away with ?

		At the Man - chester -LRB- N. H. -RRB- Public Library , as announced in its current yearly Report , the bars were let down a year ago , to the extent of allowing two novels at a time to each borrower , but instead of a consequent increase in the proportion of fiction circulated the records show a decrease ; which may be taken as illustrating once more the undesirability of what is freely offered us , as compared with the charm of the interdicted .

		THE ANCIENT DISPUTE AS TO THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS , a dispute that had its rise one hundred years ago , has some points of resemblance to the later controversy still feebly raging over the authorship of
Shakes	LOCATION	- peare 's works .

		Like the latter , this literary wrangle gave occasion to the spilling of con - siderable ink , including printers ' ink .

		A book entitled `` Who Wrote the Earlier Waver - ley Novels ? ''

		discussed the question with all the zeal and much of the bias displayed by the Baconians of the present day in their elab - orate special pleadings .

		Its author ,
William John FitzPatrick	PERSON	, proved to his own satis - faction that
Scott	PERSON	's relation to `` Waverley , '' `` Guy
Mannering	PERSON	, '' ``
Rob Roy	PERSON	, '' `` The Antiquary , '' and `` The Tales of My Land - lord , '' was , at the utmost , nothing more intimate than that of editor or compiler .

MEXICO	LOCATION	'S FIEST BOOK .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The reference in THE DIAL of
July 16	DATE	to Mex - ico 's first book is incorrect .

		There has been much divergence of information on this subject , but the researches of Senor
Jose Toribio Medina	PERSON	, author of '' Introduccion de la Imprenta en
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Santiago	LOCATION	,
Chile	LOCATION	,
1910	DATE	-RRB- and compiler of the mag - nificent eight-volume bibliography , '' La Imprenta en

Santiago	LOCATION	, 1907-1911 -RRB- , may be ac - cepted as final .

		According to
Senor Medina	PERSON	,
Mexico	LOCATION	's first printed book was ''
Doctrina Chris	PERSON	- tiana en la lengua mexicana y castellana , '' printed in the City of
Mexico	LOCATION	`` en casa de Juan Crom - berger ano de mill y quinientos y trienta y nueve . ''

		The actual printer was
Juan Pablos	PERSON	, an Italian , who brought the printing plant to
Mexico	LOCATION	as agent for Cromberger .

		Cromberger , a German , was at the time the leading printer of
Seville	LOCATION	, and was granted the exclusive privilege of printing in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Cromberger never came to
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The denial of freedom of printing in Spanish-speaking
America	LOCATION	under the rule of
Spain	LOCATION	is doubtless the chief source of the chaotic condition of Mexican affairs .

		A POET 'S PLAINT .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The poet 's vision is not always beatific : the ineffable sadness of our lot , as well as its unspeak - able joy , appeals to him .

		In reading again and not for the second or third time , either those too-little-known poems of the late
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	collected in a small volume entitled '' Vol - unteer Grain , '' I was struck by these lines from `` Retrogression , '' unfortunately so timely at pres - ent : '' Weep ,
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, for thy perverse child , Thy youngest , Man ; whose father ,
Time	ORGANIZATION	, Dowered him with passions fierce and wild , A heritage from out the slime . ''

		F > B ' IN DEFENCE OF AUTOGRAPH-HUNTEKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read the interesting paragraph in your issue of
August 1	DATE	apropos of a recent sale of
Stevenson	ORGANIZATION	autographs in
London	LOCATION	.

		Rarely have I had occasion to find fault with THE DIAL for indulging in harsh , immoderate , and ill-chosen 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	language .

		But I must now give voice to a com - plaint against the first two sentences of the para - graph in question , wherein the author is styled a `` victim '' who is `` pestered '' by autograph - hunters .

		Expressions so undeserved seem to indi - cate that the writer of them has been gullible enough to accept as a verity the petulant remarks of authors who pretend to be much annoyed by the so-called '' autograph fiend . ''

		These outbursts , not always meant to be taken seriously , were very properly characterized by the late
Adrian Hoffman Joline	PERSON	as `` A Certain Affectation of the Great . ''

		Be it far from me to defend the autograph - hunter in everything he does , for his conduct is often reprehensible ; but surely he is not wholly bad .

		Often he is intelligent , amiable , courteous , persuasive , and withal a pleasing flatterer .

		He is , to say the least , a benefactor to the small celebrity , and a not unjust penalty upon the large one .

		Many a struggling author has been made happy by a letter from this particular variety of '' fiend '' which showed genuine appreciation .

		It cheered him and made him feel that he was somebody after all , even if the critics had treated him shabbily or ignored him entirely .

		I am convinced that authors retain some human characteristics , and are far from being displeased by requests for their autographs .

		But , of course , it would never do to permit this lamentable weak - ness to become generally known ; therefore hauteur is feigned to keep the autograph-hunter properly humble .

		No , the seeker of autographs is not wholly bad .

		There are innumerable demons more to be dreaded , pitied , or despised , as the case may be .

		The auto - graph-hunter has his faults , Heaven knows , but he is an angel -LRB- although he may not always reveal himself -RRB- compared with those other persons who pursue every man and woman of sufficient promi - nence to attract their baleful attention .

		There is the ambitious young author who sends his works in manuscript with the modest re - quest that you read them and find him a publisher ; the person devoted to charity who has heard that you are always `` kind to the poor , '' and proffers a child or two for adoption , or asks you to lift a mortgage and receive the blessing of him who is ready to perish ; the young woman who has heard that you are rich and requests you to buy her a piano ; the photograph-collector who honors you by asking for your likeness large size in six different positions : the genealogical fiend who is sure you are related to him and asks for your family tree ; the intrusive individual who wants to find out your peculiarities that he may exploit them in the public journals , surely the thought of these demons should cause the author to be indulgent and look with amenity upon the auto - graph-hunter !

		It seems to me that a very readable article might be written on , the subject of '' The Other Fiends , '' and I am sure that the much-abused autograph - collector would enjoy it hugely .

		He has himself been painted in dark colors so long that the reading of such a dissertation would be balm to his soul .

		Who will write the article ?

		L. D. T.
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 135 THE RELEVANCE OF WAR . '

		In `` Arms and Industry '' Mr.
Norman Angell	PERSON	comes again to the defence of the prop - ositions first submitted to the reading public some five years since in ' ' The Great Illusion . ' '

		The extensive notice and earnest discussion provoked by that work made it instantly famous and the effect it is having on public opinion everywhere gives good ground for the opinion recently expressed by a prominent Western educator that Mr.
Angell	PERSON	is the father of a new political philosophy that is destined to have a profound influence in human affairs .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's contentions are summarized by himself in the work at hand as follows : '' Save only in a narrow juridical sense ... the nations which form the European community are not sovereign , nor independent , nor entities , nor rival , nor advantageously predatory ; nor does the exercise or possession of the means of physical coercion determine the relative advantage of each ; nor is physical coercion within their borders the ultimate sanction of social organization , of law and justice .

		Military power is irrelevant to the promotion of the aims , moral and material , postu - lated in that statement of ' political principles ' upon which militarism rests . ''

		This theme is amplified in the six papers which make up the volume .

		Each paper is the substance of a lecture given under different auspices and , as might be expected , there is a good deal of repetition .

		An excellent sum - mary appears as an introduction .

		The first lecture , `` The Need for Restate - ment of Certain Principles , and the Grounds of Inquiry , '' takes the position that the accepted theories of international polity are misconceptions which misrepresent the funda - mental principles of human association and cooperation and consequently produce wide - spread moral results , affecting society inju - riously in many ways .

		The fundamental misconception is that concerning the part that physical force plays in human affairs ; for the role of force has been entirely altered by the increasing commercial interdependence of na - tions and the consequent division of labor .

		The second paper , `` Moral and Material Factors in International Relations , '' discusses the charge that `` Angellism '' is unmoral and sordid , because it is based on gross material - ism and national self-interest .

		Mr.
Angell	PERSON	takes the ground that the alleged `` sordid - ness ' ' of his views is the result of mental con - fusion ; that the well-being of society is the * ARMS AND INDUSTRY .

		A Study of the
Foundations of International Polity	ORGANIZATION	.

		final aim of both economics and morals ; ' ' that morality is not some abstraction to which the conduct of men , to their hurt , must conform , but is , on the contrary , the codification of the general interest ; that conduct on the part of the whole , which will best serve the interests of the whole ... that is to say , the self - interest of society . ' '

		Thus morality and self - interest are identical and not at variance .

		The `` Influence of Credit upon Interna - tional Relations '' is a consideration of the place of banking in the new international polity .

		The point emphasized is , not that in - ternational finance has made the world a financial unit for this has been true for some time but rather that international credit has produced a highly developed system of sensory nerves ; and , what is more , it has done this recently , so that for the first time in history we have at hand the means of dis - covering the actual effect of both strife and cooperation as factors in international rela - tions .

		The soundness of this contention has been strikingly illustrated by the effect of the present war in
Europe	LOCATION	on the world 's finance .

		The fourth lecture , `` The Place of
Military Force	ORGANIZATION	in Modern Statecraft , '' deals with the all-important distinction between military and police force .

		Military force is , at bottom , predatory ; as such , it no longer serves any useful purpose .

		The only legitimate use of force in present-day society is to defend our - selves against the predatory acts of others ; that is , to neutralize their predatory force .

		But this is precisely what is attempted by police force in seeking to maintain order ; police force prevents one party from infring - ing the rights of another , it maintains a fair balance .

		The domestic security of peoples called civilized rests not at all on their having in the state a great military force ; on the contrary is assured by the circumstance that this military force shall not be used against them , and by a social convention not to use any but police force .

		This is the very basis of civilization .

		`` Two Keels to One not Enough '' is the title given to Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's remarks in a debate before the students of the
Cambridge Union	ORGANIZATION	between himself and Mr.
Yerburgh	PERSON	, President of the
British Navy League	ORGANIZATION	, on the motion `` That the safety of the British Empire and its trade can only be secured by an unques - tioned British naval superiority maintained upon the basis of two keels to one of capital ships against the next strongest European Power , and the full necessary complement of smaller craft . ''

		The supporter of the motion offered the usual argument that unless En - gland maintained control of the sea her com - merce would eventually pass to other hands .

		136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	Mr.
Angell	PERSON	replied , in substance , that the Ger - mans had already , in spite of the unquestioned superiority of the British navy , gained com - merce at
Great Britain	LOCATION	's expense ; that even if
Germany	LOCATION	could defeat
England	LOCATION	's navy and annex
Canada	LOCATION	-LRB- or any other colony -RRB- , she would not be able to engage in any trade with that country that she is not free to engage in to-day .

		Chiefly , however , did Mr.
Angell	PERSON	attack what he considered the fundamental fallacy of his opponent 's positioa in discuss - ing a problem that involves two nations , in terms of one .

		If it was good policy for
Great Britain	LOCATION	to have a superior navy , it must also be good policy for
Germany	LOCATION	, whose people are no less civilized .

		... So that Mr.
Yer	PERSON	- burgh 's solution for achieving security for two parties likely to quarrel was for each to be stronger than the other !

		Manifestly this was impossible .

		Accordingly the
Navy League	ORGANIZATION	, instead of seeking to influence public opinion along these impracticable lines , should direct its energy and money into useful channels , and begin by considering international prob - lems as they are , as two-sided instead of one - sided questions .

		It should approach the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- German problem as the relations of
Canada	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	have always been ap - proached .

		In the case of the latter all efforts were directed to cultivating amity and elim - inating military equipment ; with the result that there exists a feeling of amity and mutual security between the states involved .

		The same condition could be achieved with Ger - many if men only conscientiously tried ; as they would , if they were but taught to see the fundamental fallacy of the militarist 's phi - losophy .

		It is pertinent to note that the auditors of the debate endorsed Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's position by a vote of 203 to 187 .

		The last of the lectures is entitled `` Con - cerning the
International Polity Movement	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It makes clear in what respects `` Angellism '' departs from the '' Old Pacifism . ''

		The con - crete illustration is as follows : Jones had greatly wronged
Thomas	PERSON	and then disap - peared ; and ever since
Thomas	PERSON	had declared that he would kill Jones should he reappear .

		One day he learns that
Jones	PERSON	has returned .

		Immediately certain of Thomas 's friends ap - peal to him on moral and religious grounds not to carry out his threat ; others appeal to his self-interest by pointing out the evil con - sequences to him of his proposed deed .

		But
Thomas	PERSON	is resolved .

		Then comes a third party who points out that the man who has returned is not the Jones he is supposed to be , but another person altogether ; that the original
Jones	PERSON	died years ago .

		Obviously this argu - ment would be entirely effective .

		Similarly , the '' Old Pacifism '' attacked war on moral and religious grounds , or on the basis of the self-interest of society .

		The `` New Pacifism '' proclaims the irrelevance of war to the ends , either moral or material , for which states exist .

		This is the new interna - tional polity .

		Though Mr.
Angell	PERSON	's style is often involved , what he has to say is always compelling .

		His new book is not only most instructive but profoundly stimulating , and deserves to be widely read .

		EDWARD
B. KREHBIEL	PERSON	.

		THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SCIENTIFIC MAN .

		* It is probable that the work of
Lester Ward	PERSON	will never attain that place in the public esti - mation to which it is in a sense entitled .

		As Professor
Ross	PERSON	said , he never reached the people , but he reached the people who reached the people .

		In the days when laissez faire was popular ,
Ward	PERSON	produced his `` Dynamic Sociology '' ; a weighty protest against the current attitude , and a successful one .

		It was no small wonder that this comparatively young man from
Illinois	LOCATION	, who had grown up with no particular educational or social advan - tages , and had settled down to a quiet life in civil service at
Washington	LOCATION	, should be able to serve as the herald of a new era .

		In the account he gives us of the conception and development of his book , we see how his orig - inal and independent mind reacted in the presence of events and ideas , and evolved out of the turmoil a philosophy of action .

		To-day his main position is accepted as a matter of course , and it is difficult to appreciate his originality .

		At the same time , utterly unable to confine itself to narrow channels ,
Ward	PERSON	's mind flowed in other directions , and in particular that of botany .

		He tells us that it might have been zoology or what not , but botany was for him at that time the most accessible of the natural sciences .

		So , while appearing before the world as the apostle of a new sociology ,
Ward	PERSON	was zealously collecting the flora of the Dis - trict of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and publishing a standard work on that subject .

		It was but a short step from the study of living plants to that of fossil ones , and here again the door of oppor - tunity stood open .

		The splendid old palaeo - botanist
Lesquereux	PERSON	was coming to the end of his life 's work , and the heavy task of dealing with the important materials arriving in * GLIMPSES OF THE COSMOS .

New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL
Washington	LOCATION	from the government surveys necessarily fell to a younger man .

		Ward left the
Bureau of Statistics	ORGANIZATION	in
1881	DATE	, and joined the
Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	, when he was put to work on the extinct floras of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the course of time he produced a number of large works of first-class importance ; so that many , who knew little or nothing of his sociological works , thought of him only as an eminent palaeobotanist .

		Thus he came to live a sort of double life with two sets of friends and admirers .

		When the reviewer visited him in
Washington	LOCATION	some fifteen years ago , he was received by the botanist , w r ho smilingly turned into the sociologist upon request , the object of the visit being sociological .

		Although Ward himself thus sharply distinguished between his two main occupations , in another sense they w r ere inextricably fused .

		The botanical and geological work had everything to do with his basic scientific opinions , and therefor ^ with his sociology .

		It is not too much to say that this actual contact with scientific data in detail and in the mass gave him a great advantage over those who were sociologists alone , without any practical acquaintance with the details of scientific work .

		Toward the end of his life ,
Lester Ward	PERSON	desired to gather together the fruits of his labors , and give to the public materials supplementary to his larger works , and valuable for the general interpretation of his thought .

		Rejecting the idea of an autobiography , the outward cir - cumstances of his life having been relatively uninteresting , he conceived the plan of col - lecting and republishing all his minor wait - ings .

		The plan , as now carried out , includes everything which had been printed , except the large works , and a single article which has been lost .

		The titles of the books are entered in their chronological order , and full details are given as to how they came to be written and printed .

		Thus , it is assumed , we are given materials sufficient for tracing the evolu - tion of
Lester Ward	PERSON	's thought , from the time when he first began to express it in writing .

		There are to be twelve volumes , of which three have appeared .

		It is only fair to the author to state that he recognized the worthlessness of many of the earlier writings , and the ephemeral nature of others .

		He wished only to appear as he was , and had been , leaving the public to form its judgment of the whole .

		Whether this is fair to the writer or to the public , may well be an open question .

		All of the past may be sig - nificant for the present and the future , but for the practical purposes of life , most of it must be forgotten .

		We are Inclined to ask , what did
Ward	ORGANIZATION	actually contribute of value to human knowledge and thought , and not , what did he succeed in getting printed ?

		The first paper reprinted , written at the age of sixteen , is a fearful production of the dime novelette sort , of no conceivable value to any - body .

		Much of the other matter in the first volume has to do with ephemeral controver - sies of various kinds .

		Thus article 33 consists of an attack on the postmaster at
Eufaula	LOCATION	,
Alabama	LOCATION	; while article 39 is an apology for the same , the whole thing having been based on a misunderstanding .

		Perhaps the limit of unnecessary republication is reached in the several anonymous reviews of his own book , `` Dynamic Sociology , '' which Ward con - tributed to the newspapers of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		What are we to think of a writer who is not only willing to write laudatory reviews of his own work , but actually republishes them among his contributions to thought ?

		They may , in part , be regarded as useful sum - maries of the author 's views ; but how seri - ously can we take such statements as these ? ''

		That this book is destined to produce a pro- found impression upon the more thoughtful classes of society , and one that will grow with repeated and extended perusal , we can not doubt .

		That such a system of thought should have emanated from an American is a most hopeful sign ... Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's system of philosophy will suffer nothing in comparison with any of the more pre - tentious ones that have been brought forth on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, such as that of Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	. ''

		A priori , we should say that the man who could puff his own literary product in this way must be a humbug ; yet Ward doubtless sincerely believed what he wrote , and more - over it was not far from being true .

		In spite of this , the whole matter is ominous enough .

		Regarded in the most favorable light , it remains discreditable to American literature and science that such proceedings should be not only possible , but in some quarters , at least , considered natural and proper .

		The opportunities afforded by anonymous review - ing have been so frequently abused , that it would doubtless be advantageous to abandon it altogether .

		Bombastic publishers ' an - nouncements also serve to indicate our lack of standards of dignity and decency , and the authors concerned can hardly escape all responsibility .

		No doubt
Lester Ward	PERSON	's failings illustrate in a large measure his views concerning the coercive nature of the environment , and it is correct
Wardian	PERSON	doctrine to condemn them , trying to create conditions unfavorable to their recurrence in others .

		138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	THE GERMAN EMPIRE . '

		A short time ago there was published in
Germany	LOCATION	an ambitions cooperative work bear - ing the title '' Deutschland nnter
Kaiser Wilhelm II	PERSON	. ''

		Among the various sections contributed by experts , one of rather special promise was that devoted to `` Deutsche Poli - tik , '' written by the former Imperial chan - cellor , Prince von Billow .

		And , although it appears that the Prince 's treatment of his subject was at all times cautious , and not in - frequently colorless , the sketch which he has written is , none the less , well worthy of a wide and thoughtful reading ; so that the enterprise which has brought it within the reach of En - glish readers is to be commended .

		The Ex-chancellor 's book is made up of a series of brief subsections dealing , one by one , with a great variety of topics .

		It falls into two principal parts , the one relating to for - eign policy , the other to home affairs .

		Now and again the author takes the reader into his confidence and tells things which previously were unknown or but half suspected ; and oc - casional passing allusions and expressions of opinion , coming from a political personage of such experience and eminence , take on a high degree of interest and significance .

		Most of the time , however , as has been intimated , the facts stated are familiar , and the interpreta - tion of them is guarded and conventional .

		Of the real reasons , for example , of the Prince 's retirement from the chancellorship under fire in
1909	DATE	nothing is told , at any rate nothing that the world did not already know .

		Perhaps it is too early to expect from Prince Billow frank revelations of the sort which
Bismarck	PERSON	made in his memorable ' ' Gedanken und
Erin	PERSON	- nerungen . ' '

		In his discussion of German foreign policy the author begins by laying emphasis upon the inhospitable attitude assumed by the older Powers toward the newly created Empire of forty years ago , and he goes on to maintain that the achievements of the Empire in the domain of international politics are the more noteworthy by reason of the unusual suspi - cion and jealousies directed toward her by
Great Britain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The opin - ion is avowed that , with the exception of
France	LOCATION	, the surrounding nations would have become reconciled to
Germany	LOCATION	's new measure of political power , if only the process of growth had terminated with the founding of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		That event , however , was not the end , but the beginning ; and even before the new position in
Europe	LOCATION	was entirely se - cured the Empire had entered actively upon * IMPERIAL

		its career as a participant in world politics .

		The consequence has been the continued ani - mosity of those nations which in times past had been accustomed to share the supervision of the world 's larger affairs .

		In no small measure , Prince von Billow would have us be - lieve , the upbuilding of the German army , and especially the augmentation of the German fleet , is attributable to the international ten - sion caused by this unyielding and ill-con - cealed grudge of the older states .

		The maritime rivalry of
Germany	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	is discussed very much as any orthodox
Navy Leaguer	ORGANIZATION	might be expected to discuss it .

		To the author English policy ap - pears perfectly natural , and even defensible .

		`` The alpha and
omega	ORGANIZATION	of English policy has always been the attainment and maintenance of English naval supremacy .

		To this aim all other considerations , friendships as well as enmities , have always been subordinated .

		It Avould be foolish to dismiss English policy with the hackneyed phrase perfide
Albion	ORGANIZATION	.

		In real - ity this supposed treachery is nothing but a sound and justifiable egoism , which , together with other great qualities of the English peo - ple , other nations would do well to imitate .

		Having admitted as much , the Ex-chancellor goes on to maintain that
Germany	LOCATION	's interests as a nation compelled her to enter upon a course which was `` bound to inconvenience
England	LOCATION	'' ; although he contends that En - gland should have recognized more clearly that the international policy of
Germany	LOCATION	has been defensive and not , as was the interna - tional policy of
Spain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, so persis - tently opposed by the English in earlier centuries , offensive .

		`` There is absolutely no ground , '' it is asserted , `` for the fear that with the rise of German power at sea the Ger - man love of battle will be awakened .

		Of all the nations of the world the Germans are the people that have most rarely set out to attack and conquer ... Without boastfulness or exaggeration , we may say that never in the course of history has any power , possessing such superior military strength as the Ger - mans , served the cause of peace in an equal measure .

		This fact can not be explained by our well-known and undoubted love of peace .

		... As a matter of fact , peace has primarily been preserved , not because
Germany	LOCATION	herself did not attack other nations , but because other nations feared a repulse in the event of their attacking
Germany	LOCATION	.

		The strength of our armaments has proved to be a more effective guarantee of peace than any in the last tumul - tuous centuries . ''

		An Anglo-German alliance , warmly advo - cated in some quarters , seems to Prince von
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 139 Billow clearly outside the bounds of practica - bility .

		But , in his opinion , war between the two powers will never come , provided -LRB- 1 -RRB- Ger - many shall maintain a fleet which can not be attacked without very grave risk to the at - tacking party , -LRB- 2 -RRB- there shall be no undue or unlimited indulgence in shipbuilding and armaments , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- nothing shall be allowed to force an irremediable breach between the two countries , such as would have resulted had the
German Government	ORGANIZATION	acceded to the desires of the Anglophobe elements at the time of the Boer War .

		The author 's view of the course of his coun - try 's home affairs is pessimistic .

		He affirms that , - with the exception of a few bright spots , the history of German home policy is a record of political mistakes .

		No people , he says , has found it so difficult as have the Germans to attain solid and permanent political institu - tions , and his conclusion is that , despite the abundance of merits and great qualities with which the German nation is endowed , political talent has been denied it .

		It is not , he affirms , that the Germans lack political knowledge .

		In the study of political science they have gone as far as any people .

		It is rather that they lack the art of proceeding from insight to practical application .

		`` Politically , as in no other sphere of life , there is an obvious dis - proportion between our knowledge of political things and our power ... For the German the knowledge of political things is usually a purely intellectual matter , which he does not care to connect with the actual occurrences of political life . ' '

		The fundamental reason for the German 's alleged inability at this point is found in his excessive individualism and his lack of a sense of the common good ; which , in a manner , is but to reiterate the caustic observation of Goethe to the effect that the Germans are very capable individuals but wretchedly inefficient in the bulk .

		Speaking of political matters , the Ex-chan - cellor asserts boldly that , considering the peculiarities of the Imperial governmental arrangements , the parliamentary system as it is operated in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	would not be desirable in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		He admits read - ily enough , however , that the parliamentary system has its advantages , the chief of which , in his opinion , arises from the fact that the great political parties are educated by expe - rience and sobered by responsibility in con - trolling , while in power , the affairs of the country .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, and in other states not governed by a parliamentary majority , parties manifest ' ' a great deal of conviction and very little feeling of responsibility . ''

		Their pri - mary vocation becomes that of criticism , often to the embarrassment of those actually charged with the conduct of the government .

		The writer recognizes that , in
Germany	LOCATION	as else - where , parties are inevitable .

		But he pleads for a diminution of obstructionist and irre - sponsible party spirit .

		Without considering himself a party man , he confesses to a general sympathy with the views of the Conservatives ; although in its attitude in recent years upon the reform of the Imperial finances this party has been , he believes , entirely in the wrong .

		The Liberal party , he admits , has many ele - ments of strength and to it the country owes a large debt of gratitude .

		Both Conservatism and Liberalism , it is declared , are not only justified , but `` necessary for our political life . ''

		The growth of the popular vote of the Social Democrats since
1890	DATE	is pronounced `` a very serious matter '' ; and it is contended in per - fect candor that , so long as it may prove im - possible to detach the voters from the Socialist cause , it is the duty of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and of all supporters of the existing order to cooperate to reduce -LRB- as was so successfully done in
1907	DATE	-RRB- the quota of Socialist deputies in the
Reichstag	LOCATION	.

		The conviction which the results of the elections of
1912	DATE	would seem utterly to belie is expressed that the result of such policy will be the alienation of large numbers of voters from a party which they have found to be unsuccessful .

		LiOL , L , AKDY AND THE REFORMATION IX ENGLAND .

		* In the early Victorian period
Foxe	PERSON	's ' ' Book of Martyrs '' was taken from its place beside the
Bible	LOCATION	on the centre-table and edited in eight volumes for the library shelves .

		As a force in English politics and religion it was then decently interred .

		In taking notice of
Foxe	ORGANIZATION	's great work , scholars found something to condemn and more to wonder at , for it * LOLLARDY AND THE REFORMATION IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		An His - torical Survey .

		By
James Gairdner	PERSON	.

		Volume IV. , edited by
William Hunt	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	may be called the first English history from sources .

		For three centuries it had confirmed Englishmen at home and overseas in the be - lief that the so-called martyrs of the national Church were really martyrs , and that what they had stood for was right .

		There were nine editions in folio of
Foxe	ORGANIZATION	's book printed between
1563	DATE	and
1684	DATE	.

		Copies were in cathedrals and parish churches ; there was one at
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	.

		To understand , therefore , the significance of the `` Book of Martyrs '' in modern political and religious thought one should be prepared to make a careful study not only of English history but also of English literature .

		Few men are prepared for such a task , and in selecting his title `` Lollardy and the Refor - mation in
England	LOCATION	'' one feels that the late Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	, who died before he had fin - ished the fourth volume , undertook to ex - pound the conditions that inspired Foxe 's book .

		As a lifelong student and editor of British Government Rolls and Records he was better fitted than anyone else to make use of the mass of material first unlocked by his genius and industry .

		For however one may object to Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	's use of terms , or to his sense of proportion , all must agree that the narrative and descriptive details so accu - rately recorded and to most readers so novel will preserve the work in spite of contro - versies which his treatment is bound to excite .

		To the student of history or literature these four sober volumes are more exciting than the latest novel .

		The reason is that Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	has given us no academic exposition ; one might indeed contend that in spite of elab - orately accurate faithfulness to his sources he seems to have been untouched by the methods of historical study of such contemporaries as
Poole	LOCATION	,
Stubbs	PERSON	,
Maitland	LOCATION	, and
Pollock	LOCATION	.

		But it would be idle to complain that he has failed to do what he had no mind to do .

		One can - not read far without perceiving that his pur - pose , quite baldly stated , is to offset the age-long influence of the `` Book of Martyrs '' and to make a kind of argument instead of a scientific exposition .

		In so doing the historian takes a position that is simply fascinating by reason of its difficulties .

		He must have a point of view contemporary with the events narrated .

		And this point of view must be not that of the forces at work which were ultimately domi - nant , but of those that were not .

		He must be the champion of a lost cause .

		Hence from
Wyclif	ORGANIZATION	's day to that of `` Bloody Mary '' all English citizens opposed to
Rome	LOCATION	are here - tics . ' '

		His use of the term he finds warranted by the documents .

		These persons were called heretics by the authorities , and therefore they were heretics .

		One can but wonder how long they continued so ; perhaps no longer than the word is found in the records .

		Only a con - sistent ultramontanism could carry the term into
Elizabeth	PERSON	's reign , however necessary it might seem to be with reference to
Htenry the Eighth	ORGANIZATION	, to the boy
Edward	ORGANIZATION	, and to the opponents of Mary .

		No foreign ambassador could make out a worse case for
Henry	ORGANIZATION	and Edward than does Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	, nor more sympathetically relate the constant distresses of the unhappy devote
Mary	PERSON	, dependent upon the Emperor and incapable of understanding her people .

		In his faithfulness to a point of view , Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	makes us feel the trag - edy of her situation more keenly than does
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		But the reader can hardly fail to ask what was actually the orthodox point of view then , political as well as religious .

		Was it the Emperor 's ?

		Was it the Pope 's ?

		Was it that of the French King ?

		The objection to the term `` heretic '' as applied to the fol - lowers of a national Church in
England	LOCATION	re - sides in the religious connotation of the word ; whereas the Lollards from
Wyclif	LOCATION	's time , in their doctrines of sovereignty , righteousness as a test of title , and nationalism , were polit - ical as well as religious heretics .

		It is not accidental that Wyclifite doctrines are incor - porated in the Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of
England	LOCATION	and became the law of the land .

		From what has been said of Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	's point of view , and of his faithfulness to the records he commends
Foxe	PERSON	for the same kind of trustworthiness one may not criti - cize his treatment of the literature of the time .

		But the critic of English and Scottish literature of the sixteenth century would be hard put to it in regarding that literature as ' ' heretical . ' '

		He would doubtless say many pungent things ; but the criticism would be so unsympathetic as to be worthless .

		But how is the history of the English Reformation still to be written without a profoundly sym - pathetic understanding of that literature ?

		Government documents and diplomatic cor - respondence are well ; but in movements orig - inally `` of the people , by the people , and for the people '' a phrase said to be
Wyclif	ORGANIZATION	's the literature must be reckoned with .

		The first Reformation dramatist Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	characterizes as `` the notorious , foul-mouthed Bale . ''

		To one ignorant of Bishop Bale 's ac - tivity such an allusion is quite misleading .

		It is far from satisfactory to dispose of the first historian of English literature with unpleas - ant epithets .

		One can not imagine the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	editor of Bale 's `` Index , '' Mr.
R. L. Poole	PERSON	, betraying such a prejudice .

		In ` these volumes the English Martyrs ap -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 141 pear as a pretty disreputable lot .

		They were wrongly , when not merely foolishly , zealous in an unworthy cause .

		Such a point of view is impracticable ; it is too remote from that of other competent critics .

		To the inevitable question , why should the distinguished his - torian have expounded his material as he did , the answer may be found in social phenomena of Dr.
Gairdner	PERSON	's later years rather than in the period of the English Reformation .

		MOUNTAINEERING IN
CANADA	LOCATION	.

		* Within the last few years the varied attrac - tions and practically limitless possibilities of the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	have become widely known through such books as
Wilcox	PERSON	's '' The Rockies of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' Outram 's '' In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies , ''
Hornaday	PERSON	's `` Camp-fires in the Canadian Rockies , '' and
Coleman	PERSON	's `` The Canadian Rockies . ''

		Of the other great section of what is called the Ca - nadian Alps , the
Selkirk Range	ORGANIZATION	, compara - tively little , however , has been written , and that little is not readily accessible .

		Only two books have hitherto been available , and of these
Green	ORGANIZATION	's `` Among the Selkirk Glaciers '' is long out of print , and
Wheeler	PERSON	's elaborate work , ' ' The Selkirk Range , ' ' being a Canadian government publication , is practically un - known to the general public .

		It is there - fore a matter for congratulation to those w r ho know something of the Selkirks that an ade - quate description is at last available of this region of magnificent peaks , glittering snow - fields , and deep emerald valleys .

		Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's book is the result of five seasons ' mountaineer - ing and exploration in the Selkirks , particu - larly in the unknown country north of the main line of the
Canadian Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a record not only of competent topo - graphical and scientific work , but also of travel and mountain-climbing in a virgin region combining all the most fascinating elements of Alpine scenery .

		The author has proved his ability both to conquer high peaks and to give his readers vivid impressions of the incidents and rewards of mountaineering .

		Probably the most interesting chapters in the book are those which describe the repeated attempts , at last crowned with success in
1912	DATE	, to reach the summit of
Mount Sir Sandford	ORGANIZATION	, the undisputed monarch of the Selkirks .

		The final climb , full of exciting incidents from start to finish , ended in a spectacular traverse along the edge of a sheer cliff , with a drop * MOUNTAINEERING AND EXPLORATION IN THE SELKIRKS .

		of perhaps a mile on one side and an over - hanging cornice of soft snow above ready to break away at any moment .

		This dangerous bit of work , which came perilously near an unjustifiable risk , was only attempted because the party had reached a point where the goal was almost within sight , and there was absolutely no other way of reaching it .

		The temptation was irresistible , and it must not be forgotten that the climbing party was an exceptionally strong one , consisting of two experienced amateurs and two thoroughly competent Swiss guides .

		Many things are possible to such seasoned climbers which would be sheer madness to a party of novices .

		While the conquest of Sir
Sandford	PERSON	formed the culmination of several seasons ' work , it is after all only an incident , though a notable one , in a long and exceedingly enter - taining story of camping , trail-making , moun - tain-climbing , surveying , and scientific obser - vation in the heart of a primeval wilderness .

		Throughout the book one constantly comes upon such vivid bits of description as this picture of an early morning tramp across one of the great glaciers : '' The stillness up among the great peaks before sunrise , when everything stands clasped in the firm grip of the frost , is impressive in the extreme .

		Each rivulet is hushed , snow is hard , and only rarely is a fallen rock heard .

		An occasional creak - ing of a glacier and the muffled booming of a torrent far down in the depths of some crevasse , as one passes , are nature 's only sounds .

		In the chill , melancholy twilight the awful majesty of the mountains their inordinate bulk and eternal solidity is felt intensely as a deeply solemn chord .

		Not until the growing brightness , creeping downward from the sky , bathes with gorgeous tints each embattlemented crag and tender snowy crest , is the note of glowing beauty sounded .

		But then , in the keen inspiring freshness of the dawn , one seems transported to another world . ''

		The final paragraph of the book may very well be quoted as a brief summary of the five seasons ' work , a very modest statement of valuable geographical and scientific work car - ried out under sometimes very disheartening conditions : '' Supported only by such necessities as could be carried upon men 's shoulders , we have wandered through the main range from the fastnesses of Battle valley to the remote Mount Austerity ; we have fought our way up most of the important peaks that had already been climbed and have effected the first conquests of more than fifteen others , including the redoubtable Sir
Sandford	PERSON	, monarch of all .

		The veil of primeval obscurity has been torn from this obstinate mountain and its sur - roundings , the region has been mapped , and the chief peaks , glaciers and streams named .

		If the work has not always proved easy , the rewards have been out of all proportion and the memory 142 -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	of these days among the Selkirks will be a per - petual refreshment and delight . ''

		The book is illustrated with two new maps and over two hundred exceptionally rine photographs .

		In a series of appendices the flora , topography , glaciers , geology , and me - teorology of the Selkirks are dealt with in such detail as was not possible in the body of the narrative .

		Altogether Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	has produced a most valuable and readable work devoted to a region that has been too little known or appreciated even by those who have spent years in the neighboring Rockies .

		It is safe to say that with such a vindication of their attractions as a splendid playground for mountaineers and lovers of Alpine scenery , the Selkirks will now come into their own , and the region about Sir
Sandford	PERSON	will be as deservedly popular as
Lake Louise	LOCATION	and the Valley of the Ten Peaks .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The future Recent political changes in the of .

		Orient and the new
Russo	PERSON	- Chinese agreement regarding
Mongolia	LOCATION	bring this remote and little-known land into public notice and make particularly opportune the appearance of two works of travel and exploration in this land of nomads .

		The first , `` With the Russians in
Mongolia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- by Messrs.
H. G. C. Perry	PERSON	- Ascough and
R. B. Otter-Barry	PERSON	is a narrative of a rapid traverse in early
summer of 1910	DATE	from Kalgan across the inhospitable Desert of Gobi via
Urga	ORGANIZATION	, the capital of
Mongolia	LOCATION	, to the Trans -
Siberian Railway	ORGANIZATION	near
Lake Baikal	LOCATION	.

		To this Captain Otter-Barry added an extensive tour through the centre of
Outer Mongolia	LOCATION	and across the Chuyan Alps to Biisk on the river Go .

		The work is entertaining as a revelation of the possibilities of travel in such remote regions and instructive in matters of resources of the land , developed and undeveloped .

		It is also illuminating in the side-lights it throws upon the existing commerce , long controlled by the Chinese , and ramifying to the remotest corners of this barren land of magnificent dis - tances by the slow agency of the caravans , of pack horse , yak , or camel , and less frequently by the crude creaking wagons whose ultimate goal was the Mongol market place in Peking .

		The main interest of the writers is , however , political , and the book is especially valuable in its analysis of the present political situation in
Mongolia	LOCATION	.


Russia	LOCATION	's efforts to build up a buffer state between herself and
China	LOCATION	's rapidly transforming millions culminated in
1913	DATE	in a new agreement which practically gives
Russia	LOCATION	the suzerainty over
Mongolia	LOCATION	.

		The writers are plainly of the opinion that civilization in Mon - golia will be greatly accelerated by this release from the yoke of
China	LOCATION	.

		A monthly news - paper and a Russian-drilled artillery corps are the first products , and an anti-Chinese commercial movement of wide proportions is in full swing .

		The two-volume work by Mr.
Douglas Carruthers	PERSON	on `` Unknown
Mongo	PERSON	- lia '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , with an introduction by the Right Honorable
Earl Curzon	PERSON	and three chapters on sport by Mr.
D. H. Miller	PERSON	, is a full record of a serious piece of extensive travel and exploration in
1910-11	DATE	along what was then the Russo-Chinese borderland .

		This work also is pro-Russian in point of view but it is full of illuminating information and com - ment on the impending clash of interests in
Mongolia	LOCATION	.

		The Chinese colonist as agricul - turist is without a peer and as trader few can match him in persistency and shrewdness .

		But he has not as yet brought to
Mongolia	LOCATION	much of modern civilization , although the post and telegraph have followed his footsteps from
China	LOCATION	.

		The Russian , on the other hand , brings a more modern agriculture , better transportation , and more direct connections with the Western world .

		The contest is on and the Mongolians are turning with welcome to the novelties of the Western invader .

		The author 's analysis of the helplessness of Mon - golia in the grasp of these two great contend - ing political and commercial interests is both keen and lucid .

		About one-third of the male population is withdrawn from a productive share in the life of the people and is turned into a burdensome priesthood by the elaborate system of Lamaism .

		The teachings inculcated by this form of Buddhism destroy the military spirit while the priesthood absorbs and diverts those capable of intellectual and political leadership .

		The work is amply illustrated with unusually interesting photographs of the various tribes of nomads and of the barren upland plains , snow-clad ranges , and vanish - ing lakes , and amply supplied with maps showing in detail the new territories now for the first time subjected to accurate portrayal by compass and plane-table .

		`` Stories and Poems and Other KernarL Uncollected Writings by
Bret Harte	PERSON	, ' ' compiled by Mr.
Charles Meeker Kozlay	PERSON	and published in a limited edi - tion -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is an attractive volume typo - graphically , and will form a welcome addition to many collectors ' libraries .

		The prose in this collection is more valuable than the verse , and of this the early sketches and tales are most important .

		Few readers will agree , how -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 143 ever , with the editor 's remark that these show '' the same genius which we find later in more finished form . ' '

		The serious tales , in particu - lar , are of the artificial and unreal sort that characterized so much `` polite literature '' in the mid-century ; and some of them were actu - ally republished without credit in eastern periodicals and annuals , where the later reader who has chanced upon them never suspected that they were written by the author of ' ' The Outcasts of Poker Flat . ''

		The fact is that when
Harte	PERSON	contributed to the `` Overland Monthly '' `` The Luck of Roaring Camp '' he began a new manner of which his earlier at - tempts give little promise .

		The selections in the present volume show , however , a few char - acteristics of the author which may help to an understanding of his literary career .

		He was by nature strongly satiric , and both his sub - jects and his cutting ironical manner were often liklely to be irritating .

		Absurd as was the attempt of the
San Francisco	LOCATION	press to suppress all reference to seismic disturbances on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , it is easy to see why his ' ' Lessons from the Earthquake , '' here reprinted , w T as resented by many would-be patriotic `` Western - ers .


Harte	PERSON	employed his gift of satire to best advantage in the `` Condensed Novels , '' and this volume contains two or three literary bur - lesques .

		Another striking characteristic of the young `` Western author was the breadth of his reading .

		This may in part be explained by the fact that
Harte	PERSON	had newspaper connections in the days when newspaper men were tradi - tionally the representatives and the conserva - tors of literature in the
West	LOCATION	; but it also indi - cates that he must have had tastes of his own .

		The early writings give evidence of a wide acquaintance with English classics , and with many of the myths and traditions of the older world .

		Among the miscellaneous papers , espe - cially those of later date , are some literary criticisms , mostly articles of the occasional sort , The editorial on the death of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	is somewhat disappointing , though the fact that it was written at a dash may account for its deficiencies .

		One turns to `` My Favorite Nov - elist and His Best Book '' expecting another discussion of the same master , and is surprised to find an appreciation of the `` Count of Monte Cristo . ''

		A book about
Japan	LOCATION	which is different is ``
Japan	LOCATION	's Inheri - tance : The Country , its People and their - Destiny '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- by Mr.
E. Bruce Mitford	PERSON	, F. R , G. S .

		The greater part of the volume is devoted to a description , based upon wide personal investigation , of the physical features of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Mitford	PERSON	has resided in that country for some eight years and he must The place of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		have been an ardent mountain climber for he has much to say about volcanoes , mountains , lakes , hot springs , and earthquakes , and no little modern geology is woven in with descrip - tive passages and mythologic lore .

		The con - cluding six or seven chapters deal with the people and their destiny .

		There are some shrewd observations on education and religion , the political fabric , and
Japan	LOCATION	as a colonial power .

		But especially suggestive are the chapters , `` Where East Meets West , '' and `` A Peer into the Future . ''

		`` If the nine - teenth century was the opportunity of the West , the twentieth is for the East , '' he main - tains , and in speaking of the increasing contact of the races he comments upon the Western treaty port settlements in the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		`` The foreign communities in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, as embodiments of
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	civilizations , as microcosms of the West , might have accom - plished much toward bringing East and West together .

		Who will say that they have lived up to their opportunities ?

		Backed by their respective nations and the old appeal to force , they indeed aroused the
East	LOCATION	; but fifty years of intercourse have widened , rather than bridged , the gulf . ' '

		The treatment of Orientals in the
West	LOCATION	comes in for condemnation , but the nationality of the author is evident when we read that ' '
Germany	LOCATION	and the
United States of America	LOCATION	are the chief offenders . ' '

		Nothing is said about the exclusion laws of
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, or
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		As to the future ,
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	will be driven into a mutually defensive League , which will be no `` Yellow Peril , '' for `` aggressiveness the chief attribute of the West in its dealings with the
East	LOCATION	is utterly foreign to the Chi - nese character ; prudence is the keynote of the Japanese . ''

		And in the meantime
Japan	LOCATION	will be the teacher of
China	LOCATION	, for `` the real revolu - tion that has taken place in
China	LOCATION	is the recog - nition of the fundamental value of material strength . ' '

		The seventy-five illustrations from photographs are generally out of the ordinary and are well reproduced , but the maps and plans are less satisfactory .

		ifepmvnce .

		In
Ladv Constance Lytton	PERSON	's of a militant `` Prisons and Prisoners '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- is presented a remark - ably vivid account of the pains and penalties visited upon those militant suffragists -LRB- though the writer 's term is , of course , the philolog - ically objectionable `` suffragette '' -RRB- who glory in making themselves martyrs to their cause .

		The rigors of forcible feeding are pictured by the pen of one who has suffered them to the utmost , and has four times endured imprison - ment as the consequence , freely courted , of wilful violence and destruction of property .

		144 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	Lady Constance writes about herself , her con - victions , her purposes and methods , with a frankness and fulness that make her book extremely interesting from cover to cover .

		From being afflicted in earlier life with `` an overmastering laziness and a fatalistic sub - mission to events as they befell , ' ' she schooled herself to a forcefulness and aggressiveness that ere long qualified her for high place among the more demonstrative advocates of votes for women .

		But finding her name and social station a bar to that rigorous treatment which her acts invited at the hands of the police and the prison authorities , she disguised and disfigured herself in an heroic endeavor to elim - inate the possibility of any favors being shown her by magistrates or jailers or wardresses , taking the nom de guerre , ``
Jane Warton	PERSON	. ''

		Hence the title-page of her book seems to indi - cate a dual authorship , announcing as it does that the work is written ' ' by
Constance Ly	PERSON	tton and
Jane `` Warton	PERSON	, Spinster . ''


Jane Warton	PERSON	, however , had not been many days in
Walton	LOCATION	Gaol -LRB- Liverpool -RRB- before her identity was sus - pected and she was released ere she had quite wrought her own destruction by fasting and the tortures of forcible feeding .

		It is probable that she would have been set free in any case before her time was up .

		Whether or not one believes in the cause she represents and the methods she uses for its promotion , one must recognize in her an heroic soul ; and though her book is not great as literature , it speaks to the reader with the eloquence of unadorned truthfulness and vehement earnestness .

		Two portraits , a pleasing one of Lady Constance in her proper character , and a grotesque carica - ture signed by ; '
Jane Warton	PERSON	, ' ' accompany the narrative and offer , by their contrast , con - vincing proof of the writer 's whole-souled devotion to `` votes for women . ''

		Alaska The real
Alaska	LOCATION	of the pros - pector and of the native Indian and
Esquimaux	ORGANIZATION	is that which is revealed in Dr.
Hudson Stuck	PERSON	's `` Ten Thou - sand Miles in a Dog Sled '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- not that of the coast-wise tourist or the tenderfoot enthusiast .

		The author is the archdeacon of the Yukon and his duties as missionary of the Episcopal church afford ample opportunity for winter travel in the interior of
Alaska	LOCATION	and for contact with Arctic cold below that experi - enced by polar expeditions .

		It ensures an inti - mate knowledge of Alaskan forests , tundras , and rivers under their mantle of snow and ice , as well as of the hardy , energetic , ever-hopeful prospector , the mushroom mining camp and the gentle , resourceful , hospitable , unmoral native peoples remote from our civilization .

		The author holds a brief for the right of these peoples to the preservation of their racial integrity , their native languages , their native arts and crafts , and the natural resources of fish and fur .

		He is critical of the effect not only of the parasites that follow in the wake of the miner , and of our army posts and tele - graph officials , but also of the long distance management of Indian education that sets times and seasons for school boys without reference to movements of fish and game and turns out its scholars as literate paupers rather than masters of their own language and adepts in the homely arts which make it possible for them to wring a frugal living from a reluctant land .

		The Alaskan native races are doomed to speedy extinction unless the law forbidding the sale of liquor to them is enforced and pre - ventive medicine is applied to protect them from the ravages of diphtheria , measles , and tuberculosis .

		The writer is hopeful of their success as permanent settlers of the country , is skeptical as to the agricultural possibilities of interior
Alaska	LOCATION	and likewise of any consider - able extension of the reindeer industry .

		Chap - ters on Alaskan dogs and on photography in
winter	DATE	and cameras at high latitudes are of practical importance .

		The book rings true and the reader feels the genuineness of the narrative , and notes the absence of fulsome exploitation of personal hazard in a story full of exciting incident .

		Fine illustrations , a good map , and an ample index add to the use - fulness of the work , which bids fair to become a classic of mid-Avinter travel in the far north .

		The noisome fly .

		A late volume in the recently established ``
Cambridge	LOCATION	Public Health Series '' is by Dr.
G. S. Graham-Smith	PERSON	on `` Flies in Relation to Dis - ease : Non-bloodsucking Flies '' -LRB-
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Popular interest in the suppression and elimination of the plague of flies from city and country life is on the in - crease and `` swat the fly '' campaigns have been in progress in many enterprising com - munities .

		This book gives reliable infor - mation on the appearance , structure , life-his - tory , and breeding habits of the common flies which occur in our cities and towns .

		It also gives the evidence of the agency of flies in spreading the bacteria which cause typhoid fever and other intestinal diseases , such as tuberculosis and diphtheria , and in distribut - ing certain non-bacterial diseases , and gives at length the methods by which the plague of flies may be prevented or controlled .

		There is a deal of caution in the matter and manner of the book so that the reader is left with the feeling that much is yet to be learned regard - ing the actual extent to which flies are to be
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAI , 145 credited with the spread of disease .

		Enough is surely known to justify all efforts to destroy the fly which are being made .

		But the caution is wise .

		It is well to remember that the phrase `` typhoid fly '' may tend to obscure the fact in the popular mind , that the fly is but one of many agencies in the spread of typhoid germs .

		The careful summaries of evidence regarding the agency of the fly in spreading different diseases in question and the conservative temper of the author will serve not only as ammunition for scientific attacks upon the problem of fly control and for stimulus to further bacteriological and epidemiological research , but also , it is to be hoped , as a mild corrective for those enthusiasts on this matter whose zeal exceeds their knowledge and puts their critical faculty under angesthesia .

		A very complete bibliography of nearly three hundred titles dealing with the biology of flies and their relations to disease is appended .

		Though written for the medical and biological reader the work is not so technical but that the general reader will find it replete with facts clearly stated and discussions of problems of great sanitary and social interest .

		A study of
Henry V	ORGANIZATION	.

		The mention of
King Henry V. of England	ORGANIZATION	always brings up memories of his victorious career in
France	LOCATION	, and especially of the crushing defeat that he administered to the astonished French at
Agincourt	ORGANIZATION	in
1415	DATE	.

		But the impor - tance of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's reign is not to be measured by his doubtful military successes across the Channel ; his domestic policies were in some respects as far-reaching as his imperialistic ambitions .

		Mr.
James Hamilton Wylie	PERSON	has undertaken a detailed study of this interesting period , `` The Reign of Henry V. '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , the first volume of which has recently appeared .

		It covers the first two years of the reign and the contents make a solid volume of nearly six hundred pages .

		We are not informed how many volumes are to follow ; but if the author maintains the scale and proportion of the first , it will require at least three or four to complete the series .

		Mr.
Wylie	PERSON	has gathered together an immense amount of information , all of which he appears to have utilized either in the text or in his several thousand footnotes , which comprise at least two-thirds of the entire work .

		He deals with a great variety of facts and discusses almost every imaginable phase of the reign :
Continental	ORGANIZATION	diplomacy , British affairs , the civil strife in
France	LOCATION	, the Lollard movement , the English church , hospitals , almshouses , religious foundations , and the material neces - sities of warfare are some of the larger topics that Mr.
Wylie	PERSON	has treated .

		The volume con - tains an extended and illuminating account of the efforts made , especially by the French , to prevent the outbreak of war , and the treacher - ous diplomacy of the English king is shown in its true light .

		Mr.
Wylie	PERSON	has also made a detailed study of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's preparations '' for the invasion of
France	LOCATION	; of particular interest is his account of how the venture was financed .

		Students of English history will find Mr.
Wylie	PERSON	's work a mine of interesting and valu - able information ; but the general reader is not likely to be attracted to a work in which the general course of events is lost sight of in a maze of rather minute details .

		A study of naval efficiency .

		The amateur possesses a certain advantage over the professional ^ ^ in presenting for popular peru - sal almost any subject of something more than technical interest .

		He understands the lay - man 's point of view , knows what aspects of the theme will especially appeal to him , and instinctively avoids a bewildering superfluity of scientific or technical terms .

		Mr.
Robert W. Neeser	PERSON	, author of that popular presentation of naval activities , ' ' A
Landsman	PERSON	's Log , ' ' follows it up with a rather more detailed and formal account of our bluejackets ' duties and daily drill , in a handsomely printed and illustrated octavo entitled '' Our Many-sided
Navy	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		He gives us a series of well-written and agreeably-instructive chap - ters on the fleet at sea , the naval station at
Guantanamo Bay	LOCATION	, the organization of the ship , the daily life on shipboard , the battleship as an educational institution , the engineering competitions , athletics in the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, the sailor as a soldier , the torpedo flotillas , gunnery training , and target practice , with four appended papers on the
navy	ORGANIZATION	's services in times of peace , the organization and distribu - tion of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	at the date of writing , the individual ship 's organization , and the weekly routine on shipboard .

		If any landsman wishes to know the variety and profundity of his own ignorance in naval matters , and to correct a probable sufficiency of misconceptions , let him read Mr.
Neeser	PERSON	's book , which is calculated to make all its readers feel that if we must be burdened with a big navy , or what would once have been accounted such , it is some consola - tion to be assured of its admirable efficiency and its constant readiness for emergencies .

		The evolution Th ?

		ordinary layman who by of criminal accident is caught in the meshes laws and courts .

		Qf ft lawsuit ig often m y st ifi e d , amused , and exasperated by turns .

		He reads
Dickens	PERSON	's description of `` how not to do it '' in 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	the
Circumlocution Office	ORGANIZATION	and joins in the out - cry against the absurd technicalities of the courts ; if compelled to go into the fray to pro- tect his interests he retains a lawyer and col - lects a war fund to meet the inevitable costs of litigation .

		In `` A History of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Criminal Procedure ' ' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor
A. Esmein	PERSON	, we have a learned ac - count of the evolution of modern criminal pro- cedure in all countries ; for the American editors have introduced extracts from other authorities to fill the gaps left by the
Frenfch	PERSON	- man .

		Many a puzzle is cleared up , many a mys - tery is solved by this historical method .

		To meet a complex social situation by a primitive simple method would not answer to the requirements .

		Some absurdities remain to be corrected .

		The conservatism of lawyers is vividly illustrated .

		An argument in favor of the jury system , bor - rowed from
England	LOCATION	and never quite at home in
France	LOCATION	, is worth study by Americans .

		The subject of public reparation to citizens unjustly punished deserves more considera - tion than it has yet received in any country .

		To the lawyer and to the student of crimin - ology this work is indispensable .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` The
China	LOCATION	Year Book ,
1914	DATE	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- has been compiled by Mr.
H. G. W. Woodhead	PERSON	, editor of the '' Peking Gazette , '' and Mr.
H. T. Montague Bell	PERSON	, formerly editor of the `` North-China Daily News . ''

		Its information is surprisingly recent .

		A very useful volume and one which is far superior to many of its kind is ''
Siam	LOCATION	: A Hand - book of Practical , Commercial , and Political Infor - mation '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
W. A. Graham	PERSON	, of which a second edition has recently appeared .

		A list of the principal topics treated in - dicates the scope of the work : geography , science , races , history , social organization , education , gov - ernment , industries , commerce , trade and treaties , communications and transport , art , archaeology , architecture , music , dancing and the drama , relig - ion , language and literature , and bibliography .

		The instructors in
Latin	LOCATION	in
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	have published a '' Selection of Latin Verse '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume contains one hun - dred and twenty-six pages of text , entirely with - out notes , and is intended to meet the needs of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	freshmen .

		Brief explanatory notes are to follow later .

		It seems to us that for the small amount of text given the price is needlessly high .

		Various selections of the kind might well be pre - pared for sight reading in college classes , but the condition of the average college student 's pocket - book should be considered .

		The bulk of the
Williams	ORGANIZATION	volume is comprised within the time limits of Lucretius and Juvenal , with a handful of selec - tions running down to Thomas of
Celano	PERSON	and the
Dies Irae	ORGANIZATION	, in the
thirteenth century	DATE	.

		During the autumn Mr.

		A useful list of books illustrating or discussing `` American Local Dialects '' is issued by the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fiction , including many novels having comparatively little dialect , is largely represented .

		The classification is chiefly geograph - ical , there are good annotations , in brief compass , and a concluding author index .

		Mr.
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	, whose '' Pathfinders of the
Great Plains	LOCATION	, '' dealing with the explorations of La Verendrye and his sons , has just been pub - lished by
Messrs. Glasgow , Brook & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Toronto	LOCATION	, will issue shortly through the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	a volume of description and travel in the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	and Selkirks , under the title `` Among the Canadian Alps . '' ''

		The Changing Drama : Its Contributions and Tendencies , '' by Professor
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	, is to be published next month by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Based largely on a study of the drama in the theatres of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the Continent , it aims to give a general survey of the subject and to treat in more detailed manner some of its chief creative contributions .

		What promises to be one of the most notable biographies of the season is announced by
Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	in `` The Life of
S. F. B. Morse	PERSON	, '' prepared from letters and journals by his son , Mr.
Edward L. Morse	PERSON	.

		The first volume will contain an account of the inventor 's early training and deal with the interesting though little known period of his life when he set out on a career of distinction as a portrait painter .

		In the second volume Mr.
Morse	PERSON	presents in detail the story of his father 's important invention of the electric tele - graph , the difficulty in establishing his rights as the inventor , and the rewards that were finally his .

		Literature 's loss in the death of
Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	will be accounted the greater because of his com - parative youth if the young people will allow the word he being only in his sixty-second year when the pen dropped from his hand last month .

		He was born at
Vennecy	LOCATION	, near
Orleans	LOCATION	,
Aug. 27 , 1853	DATE	, finished his education at the
Lycee Charle	PERSON	- magne and the
Ecole Normale Superieure	ORGANIZATION	, then taught literature at
Havre	LOCATION	,
Algiers	LOCATION	,
Besancon	LOCATION	, and
Grenoble	LOCATION	, but in
1884	DATE	turned from teaching to the more congenial employment of writing , in which he had already met with some success .

		He succeeded
J. J. Weiss	PERSON	as dramatic critic of the '' Journal des Debats , '' and afterward filled the same office for the `` Revue des Deux Mondes . ''

		He wrote also for the '' Revue Bleue , '' and was conspicuously successful with his series of critical essays on mod - ern authors , a series subsequently issued in seven volumes under the general title , `` Les Contem - porains . ''

		His dramatic criticisms were likewise republished , in ten volumes , with the title , `` Im - pressions de Theatre . ''

		Amid these activities he found time to issue two volumes of poetry and several books of fiction , as well as a number of plays and some political writings .

		But his literary and dramatic criticism constitutes his best work , in which he showed himself an original and charming and at times a brilliant writer of the impressionist school of criticism .

		The French Academy admitted him to membership in
1896	DATE	, and few have been the Academicians who , first and last , have better de - served the honor .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS .

		.

		227 BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON .

		There is usually nothing more exciting to read at this season of the year than the pub - lishers ' announcements .

		Every goose is so much a swan before the autumn flight of books has actually begun that even those descrip - tions which are supplied by the young men whose business it is to write enthusiastically of every book their employers publish seem credible .

		The disappointments of other sea - sons , the books that promised so well in the advance notices and turned out so badly in the reading , are forgotten .

		The desire that the new books worth reading -LRB- and keeping -RRB- will be many is too keen to admit the proba - bility that they will be few .

		It seems that there never were so many interesting things coming .

		And though this year the war in
Europe	LOCATION	gives a certain advantage over pub - lishers ' announcements to the front pages of the newspapers , it is an advantage easily over - estimated .

		Not that the publishers have over - estimated the interestingness of the war news .

		Despite their concern as to the effect of the war upon the book trade they have gone ahead to announce as many books this year as they did last year , or more .

		A few impor - tations have been postponed or withdrawn , but they will rapidly be replaced by books on the war and its causes .

		Professor
Hugo Munsterberg	PERSON	is even now , we are informed , dictating many pages a day of a book con - ceived since
August 1	DATE	on `` The War and
America	LOCATION	. ''

		That there will be many others goes without saying .

		These books will belong , in so far as they discuss contemporary social forces , quite as much to economics or sociology as to history : they might be lumped off inclusively under the heading of `` social criticism . ''

		That is a heading which cuts across the formally classi - fied list of fall books which we publish in another part of this issue of THE DIAL , but one which does describe a kind of book which has greatly increased of late years .

		Indeed , some of the most valuable and stimulating books written in English during the last ten or a dozen years would come under this head - 184 THE DIAI , -LSB- Sept , 16 ing .

		Professor
Thorstein Veblen	PERSON	's '' A Theory of the Leisure Class '' and Mrs.
Olive Schreiner	PERSON	's `` Woman and Labor '' are capital examples .

		There is perhaps no book to be published this season Avhich promises to equal either of those two .

		We do not find here -LRB- or anywhere else -RRB- a title that stands out as the book of the year .

		But there are a number of titles that promise well .

		One of these is Mr.
Herbert Croly	PERSON	's `` Progressive Democracy '' and another is Mr.
Walter Lippmann	PERSON	's ' ' Drift and Mastery : An Attempt to Diagnose the Current Unrest . ''

		Professor
Edward Als	PERSON	- worth
Ross	PERSON	, who has contributed many a piquant phrase to current social criticism , is the author of `` The Old World in the New , '' a study of the different races of
Europe	LOCATION	in the
United States	LOCATION	which has been appearing serially in the `` Century . ''

		Mr.
Frederic C. Howe	PERSON	's new book is to be called ' ' The Ameri - can City . ''

		Of a different order , though doubtless written for the sake of the applica - tions to present society which their researches have enabled them to make , are Mr. and Mrs.
Walter M. Gallichan	PERSON	's new books .

		Mr.
Gal	PERSON	- lichan writes on `` Women under Polygamy '' and Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	on `` The Age of the Mother Power . ''

		We have some doubt as to whether this age ever existed , but we shall be interested to hear about it just the same .

		Miss
Ellen Key	PERSON	is to be represented this sea - son by `` The Younger Generation '' and Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	by `` Impressions and Com - ments . ''

		Two French books from opposite camps are
M. Georges Sorel	PERSON	's `` Reflections on Violence '' and
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	's `` The Dread of Responsibility . ''


M. Faguet	PERSON	is a defender of aristocracy ;
M. Sorel	PERSON	of syn - dicalism .

		The fashion of `` human documents '' is allied to the fashion of social criticism .

		Our contemporary curiosity about life , so fresh and so wide , takes the form of personal con - fessions in the popular magazines and of courses in sociology in the universities .

		Some human documents take the form of biog - raphies , as does Miss
Marie Sukloff	PERSON	's `` The Life Story of a Russian Exile , '' and some are anonymous novels , as is but we refrain from calling special attention to any anony - mous confession until we have seen it .

		Of novels which we do not hesitate to men - tion there are a number .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's new one , `` The Wife of Sir
Isaac Harman	PERSON	. ''

		will hardly be ready before Thanksgiving , owing to the war , but it will probably be worth wait - ing for .

		Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	, who last year gave us `` Youth 's Encounter , '' has com - pleted the story there begun under the title of `` Sinister Street . ''

		Other novelists who have promised sequels or the completion of trilogies have been dilatory .

		Mr.
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	is an exception .

		The third volume of his
Jacob Stahl	PERSON	trilogy will not be published until next
spring	DATE	, but it is ready for the printer .

		In the meantime he has written `` The
House	ORGANIZATION	in Demetrius Road . ''

		Miss
Ethel Sidgwick	PERSON	.

		who lias written two immensely clever volumes of the history of Antoine in `` Promise '' and `` Succession , '' has turned aside this season to write `` A Lady of Leisure . ''

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	has not finished the story of
Hilda Lessways	PERSON	and
Edwin Clayhanger	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Martin Andersen Nexo	PERSON	's four - volume novel , `` Pelle the Conqueror , '' is complete in its Danish original , and the English translation of the second volume will be ready in a month or two .

		If it is as good as the first volume it will be as well worth reading as any novel likely to be published between now and
Christ	LOCATION	- mas .

		But all the novelists are not writing trilogies and all the promising ones are not on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Coningsby Dawson	PERSON	, who made such a hit last year with ' ' The Garden without Walls , ' ' is in
England	LOCATION	, but only until the war is over .

		His new novel is called ' ' The Raft . ' '

		Mr.
Samuel Hopkins Adams	PERSON	has written a novel about an American newspaper , `` The Clarion , '' which may be the newspaper novel we have long expected and have never seen .

		A new Ameri - can novelist who may be worth while is Mr.
Edward C. Venable	PERSON	, the author of ``
Pierre Vinton	PERSON	: The Adventures of a Superfluous Husband . ' '

		Of novels by popular , or familiar .

		American writers there is no end .

		That some - where in the list there will be a genuine piece of artistry is too much to believe but not too much to hope .

		It seemed for a time as if the drama might dispute the novel 's popularity .

		The list of books about the theatre grew astoundingly and publishers began actually to print plays for readers .

		If the drama has not really challenged the novel it is perhaps because it has been so much more written about than written .

		No publisher 's announcements are complete this season without a book on the theatre , whereas many houses seem content without any plays to publish .

		So few plays
1914	DATE	THE DIAL 185 worth publishing are being written .

		Mr.
Show	PERSON	's are an exception .

		A new volume is to be expected from him , though no definite announcement of it has been made to date . -RSB-

		n addition there are a number of transla - tions from foreign dramatists , and a comedy , `` Van
Zorn	PERSON	, '' by the American poet , Mr.
Edward Arlington Robinson	PERSON	.

		Of books about the theatre , we note `` The Modern Theatre , '' by Mr.
Hiram K. Moderwell	PERSON	: `` The Modern Drama , '' by Mr.
Ludwig Lewinsohn	PERSON	; `` The Changing Drama , '' by Mr.
Archibald Hen	PERSON	- derson , and a college text-book which should be of general interest , Professor
George P. Baker	PERSON	's `` The Technique of the Drama . ''

		Poetry is not as well represented in the autumn lists as we should have liked .

		Mr.
T. Sturge Moore	PERSON	's volume , `` The Sea Is Kind , '' which contains in addition to new poems a selection from his earlier volumes , looms larger to us than anything else .

		A number of American poets are , however , to be repre - sented .

		Mr.
Nicholas Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	, Mr.
Harry Kemp	PERSON	, and Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	are among these .

		Mr.
James Stephens	PERSON	's new volume is indefinitely postponed .

		Mr.
Frank	PERSON	- lin II .

		Giddings , who is professor of sociology at
Columbia	LOCATION	, is the author of `` Pagan Poems . ''

		We hope they are as good as some of his lectures .

		The list of belles-lettres is hardly as long as usual , but there are a number of good titles in it .

		Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	is publish - ing his `` Notes on Novelists and Some Other Notes . ''

		Mr.
Gilbert Chesterton	PERSON	has a new r volume of essays ready , except for the title .

		The famous article on poetry which
Theodore \ Vatts-Dunton	PERSON	wrote for the Britannica is at last to be reprinted .

		A new book on Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, an unusually sensible one , we hear , has been written by Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Richard Curie	PERSON	has endeavored to account for Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, and to infect us with his enthusiasm for that admirable artist 's work .

		Finally , we should like to mention Mr.
Clive Bell	PERSON	's book , `` Art . ''

		It is said to be a well - written defence of post-impressionism .

		The division of travel and exploration con - tains many titles but lacks a book of such interest as the one about Captain
Scott	PERSON	's expe - dition , yet many readers will want Mr.
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's `` Through the Brazilian Wilderness . ''

		Mr.
Karl Pearson	PERSON	has already published the first volume of his life of
Francis Galton	PERSON	: Count
Ilya Tolstoy	PERSON	's reminiscences of his father will be ready shortly ; and Mr.
Edward L. Morse	PERSON	's biography of his father ,
S. F. B. Morse	PERSON	, is announced .

		Of more journalistic - interest , perhaps , are Mr.
S. S. McClure	PERSON	's `` My Autobiography , '' `` Mrs.
Pankhurst	PERSON	's Own Story , '' and Mrs.
Katherine ` Shea	PERSON	's Life of
Charles Stewart Parnell	PERSON	.

		The third and final volume of the life of Disraeli which
W. F. Monypenny	ORGANIZATION	began has been written by Mr.
G. E. Buckle	PERSON	.

		Sir
George Trevelyan	PERSON	has completed his ``
George III	PERSON	.

		and
Charles Fox	PERSON	, '' the volumes making , with his previous four volumes on `` The American Revolution , '' an unusual contribution to history .

		The list might be extended , but suffice it to say that it includes the usual batch on
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		A num - ber of works of history are temporarily post - poned .

		The new volume of the `` Cambridge Medieval History , '' which happens to be ``
Germany	LOCATION	and the Western Empire , '' is one of these .

		Some histories will doubtless have to be revised next
fall	DATE	, or the year after , or whenever the war ends .

		And that event will be the occasion of several wholly new r ones , to say nothing of all the other sorts of books that it will make necessary or possible .

		THE ASIATIC AND THE GREEK SPIRIT IN LITERATURE .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	had a Avay of calling cer - tain styles of writing which he disliked `` Asi - atic . ''

		Doubtless the specimens he had in view w 7 ere deserving of opprobrium , but the word connotes too much to be used merely in reproach .

		To the Greek mind in its clearness , moderation , and reasonableneas the vast , over - whelming , and mysterious conceptions of
Asia	LOCATION	were repugnant , and all who have inherited or been trained in the
Attic	LOCATION	mood must share the horror of the extravagant and the im - measurable .

		But after all
Asia	LOCATION	is the mother of minds , even of the Greek mind .

		^ Eschylus at least is Asiatic in conception and execution .

		The Greeks , however , in the main reduced every - thing to the measure of humanity , the gods , nature , philosophy .

		The vaster religions and systems of thought of
Asia	LOCATION	made but little account of the human unit .

		Where there were such hordes of men , man ceased to have any great value .

		It would be hard to overstate how much the world owes to the Greek reason , to its ideal of limited perfection in art and literature .

		In eighteen centuries it struggled in
Europe	LOCATION	against Asiatic ideals embodied in Christianity 186 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	and Mohammedanism .

		Homer was pitted against the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		The Schools fought against the people , for the mob is always Asiatic in its instincts .

		The profound and mysterious elements of human thought rose again and again from the depths .

		Folk-lore wrought the Romantic reactions against the Classic spirit .

		On the other hand , Science with its precision and common sense , the naturalistic and realis - tic tendencies in art and literature , have been on the side of the Greek mood .

		They have shorn the supernatural of its power ; they have made against the domination of the idea .

		More recently the great European philoso - phers have drawn from the reservoirs of Asi - atic thought .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	PERSON	, and Eucken to a large extent , are inspired by
Persia	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	.

		Vedantic , Buddhistic ,
Zoro	PERSON	- astrian doctrines are dominant in European philosophy .

		That the basic ideas of these doc - trines are essentially different from those of Greek thought , it would be vain to assert .

		But the Greeks gave a human , cheerful , day - light turn to their speculations , in comparison with which the huge pessimisms and nega - tions of
Asia	LOCATION	are appalling things of the dark .

		It seems to us that the two dominant poets of the
last century	DATE	,
Victor Hugo	PERSON	and
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, are good exemplars , respectively , of the Asiatic and the Greek spirit .

		Their careers were parallel ; there was storm and stress in Hugo 's life , and stress if not storm in
Tennyson	LOCATION	's ; both ended victoriously .

		Probably no one who ever lived had less use for the Greek virtue of `` the mean '' than Hugo .

		He was always dealing in extremes , in politics , in art , in language .

		Anything less like ordinary , average humanity than his gigantic and single-motived creations could hardly be conceived .

		Each of them is the em - bodiment of an idea and they struggle with other ideas embodied as natural forces or edicts of fate .

		But this is right enough .

		The day of the maker of mythologies is not over .

		In spite of realism and the photographing of one 's neighbors , it is the great typical figures which stand on the forefront of literature .

		The only question about Hugo 's is whether they have enough of the blood of humanity to vein their mountainlike proportions .

		Too often they seem made after a recipe : they are machines rather than mortals .

		The human mind never rejects the impossible , but it does refuse the improbable .

		It is not so much even that Hugo 's people lack reality , but that they lack desirability .

		Few readers , we imagine , read themselves into his men and women .

		As with his creations , so with his language .

		His fiery affirmations have to be taken with a grain of salt .

		Seldom does he flower into speech simply and universally true .

		Our souls may be moved , shaken by his utterances but they recover with a `` Yes , but ! ''

		He is a Pope who has declared his infallibility with - out the aid of a Council .

		This is particularly the case in regard to politics and the large affairs of men .

		With his predecessor
Shelley	PERSON	and his successor
Tolstoi	PERSON	, he stands forth as the protagonist of the poor and oppressed .

		He seems to think , however , that two classes of men , rulers and ruled , are made of different kinds of flesh .

		To him material success in life is a crown of infamy ; poverty and failure the signs and sorts of saintship .

		We fear that there is no such class division of mankind into sheep and goats .

		The poor are just about as good and bad as the rich and powerful .

		The difference between them is due to chance , luck , industry , and intellect .

		The failings and faults of the great are more visible , more ad - vertised .

		And of course they can be more fatal to the world .

		But with all its drawbacks what a vast , sig - nificant , and powerful world is that projected by
Victor Hugo	PERSON	.

		He is the supreme rhetori - cian of verse , a rhetorician so affluent , varied .

		and brilliant that he almost persuades you that art is nature .

		Yet we feel that his work is rather of the brain than of the blood .

		In lyric , ballad , and narrative poetry he falls short of poets whose work is the effluence of their whole beings ; he falls short of
Burns	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, even of Musset and
Verlaine	PERSON	.

		Three or four of his plays have a vivid life ; not merely the life of the stage , but a phantasmal splendor that thrills us in the reading of them .

		They carry with them the seeds of reproduction .

		Without going into the question whether the Cyrano and L ` Aiglon of the living
Rostand	PERSON	are greater or less than
Hernani	PERSON	and
Marion Delorme	PERSON	, it is obvious that they are of the same order .

		Two of his novels , `` Notre Dame '' and `` The Toilers of the Sea , ' ' are creations from the idea , pushed as far as this style of work can be carried .

		They will always remain as monuments of what the human mind can do when playing with nature and humanity .

		Hugo 's mind was not unlike a kaleidoscope where a few bits of glass and colored ribbon can be made to evolve intricate and magnificent patterns .

		In `` Les Miserables , '' however , there is more than the idea there is life , and it is the wide wings of this book which have carried Hugo 's fame farthest over the world .

		Truth to nature is stamped upon
Fantine	LOCATION	and Cosette ,
Gavroche	PERSON	and
Marius	PERSON	.

		It is a singular thing that God - win , driest of writers , should have supplied material for two great poets ,
Shelley	PERSON	and Hugo .

		The central theme of ' ' Les Miserables ' '
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAI , 187 is very similar to that of ``
Caleb Williams	PERSON	, '' and
Jean Valjean	PERSON	and Javert have their prototypes in the earlier book .

		But the dif - ference between the two works is like the difference between a tree in
winter	DATE	and the same tree plumaged with foliage , a pavilion of shade and a citadel of birds .

		On the whole , however , the characteristic feature of Hugo 's work is the dominance in it of the idea , and it is this which relates him to the Asiatic type .

		Probably no poet more impresses us with vastness , profound depths , existence in itself .

		As is the case with his pupil
Swinburne	PERSON	, part of this impression may be due to a trick .

		In analysis a good deal of his multiform variety becomes monotony .

		If one could strike out of his works a score or so of words infinitely repeated , such as the sun , stars , ocean , forest , horizon , with the similitudes drawn from them , the books would show a great shrinkage both in bulk and power .

		But a writer is entitled to any way of getting his effects and the effects of vastness and profoundity Hugo does get .

		Instead of grandiose conceptions , infinite , ` minute detail ; instead of figures `` all made out of the carver 's brain , '' a close rendering of common human nature ; instead of radical - ism and the propaganda of the people , con - servatism and the rights of property ; instead of mystic gleams of half the religions of the world , a faint-hearted acceptance of English ecclesiastical faith ; instead of a whirlwind of rhetoric , language so simple and natural that it seems effortless ; that is Tennyson in com - parison with Hugo .

		Restricted in thought , ringed round with conventions ,
Tennyson	PERSON	yet achieves a picture of life which we accept as substantially true .

		In magical felicity of ex - pression , meaning , music , picture melting into one , he is with the most perfect poets of the world .

		And in the coinage of phrases and lines which become the currency of common speech , he ranks in English after
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Pope .

		He realizes the Greek ideal of a limited perfection .

		He reaches the Pillars of Herakles , but he does not launch out into the unknown and discover new continents .

		It would be a fascinating task to extract from the sixty thousand or more lines of Ten - nyson 's total work the body of immortal poetry .

		Fitzgerald was perfectly right in his preference for the earlier poems .

		The vol - umes of
1842	DATE	give nearly the full measure of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's greatness .

		There is much of his later work we should want to save , but little of it is indispensable .

		To write one book which people will read fifty times is better than to write fifty books which people will read only once .

		Future generations will linger long over the fresh , sparkling , flawless songs , bal - lads , and idylls of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's early prime , while they will give but scant regard to the plays of his age and pay but an awed attention to the long poems of his maturity .

		The in - spired singer became the conscious artist .

		`` The Princess '' is
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` Love 's Labour 's Lost '' brought up to date more elaborate but less sparkling .

		The trouble , philosophically , with `` In Memoriam '' is that it is not thorough .

		It has not the trumpet tones of victory , or the tragic wail of defeat .

		Compared with the pessimisms , negations , and profundities of recent philosophic thought ,
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's meditations are lame enough .

		The poem has been eclipsed by
Fitzgerald	ORGANIZATION	's ver - sion of Omar , which is itself food for babes beside
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's fierce perversions of Per - sian thought .

		Many of the sections of `` In Memoriam ' ' are beautifully phrased , but they all seem to have been turned out of one mould .

		The later `` Idylls of the King '' are also turned out of one mould .

		They are inferior casts or copies of the first four or five pieces , whose bronze largenesses do loom and glitter in the a , rt gallery of the world .

		Passion and emotion in
Tennyson	LOCATION	are almost always subdued to beauty and decorum , but in `` Locksley Hall '' and `` Break , Break , Break '' they shatter the decorated crust , and `` Maud '' is an attempt to handle elemental fire in a large way .

		It is fine work , but no poet can do his best in an uncharacteristic direction , and
Tennyson	PERSON	was not a Byron .

		The ``
Wellington	LOCATION	Ode '' is char - acteristic , and though on a lower level than the dreamily imaginative poetry of his youth , is
Tennyson	LOCATION	's central piece as a moral poet .

		The various ballads , humorous or romantic , are perhaps his best work as a creator of char - acter .

		The plays are respectable .

		Tennyson is the executant in poetry .

		To have been a great creator , he would have needed four or five volcanoes within him and a score of earthquakes outside .

		Even in ex - pression he is very far from being always first rate .

		His simplicity sometimes sinks into silliness and his stateliness becomes magnilo - quence .

		But except Shakespeare it would be hard to find any English poet who surpasses him in variety , charm , and perfection of lan - guage .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE POET ON THE BATTLEFIELD would seem , to the modern view , decidedly out of his proper element .

		It is his part , we think , to sing of martial deeds , but not to perform them .

		Yet in classical antiquity the poet or other man of letters was customarily familiar with the use of the sword as well as with that 188 THE DIAL -LSB- Sept , 10 of the pen .

		Even the valetudinarian
Horace	PERSON	, fond of his ease and of the pleasures of the table , took part , in his earlier manhood , in the hardships and dangers of military service in the field .

		When
Brutus	PERSON	came to
Athens	LOCATION	after
Caesar	PERSON	's death ,
Horace	PERSON	, who was pursuing his studies there , joined his army and was made military tribune , with a legion under his com - mand .

		Present at the battle of
Philippi	LOCATION	he came home neither with his shield nor on it ; for he had thrown it away , ingloriously , in his flight with the rest of the republican army , as he playfully admits in one of his poems .

		Turning to the great tragic poets of
Greece	LOCATION	, we find them taking so active a part in the life about them , including offensive and defensive warfare , that the wonder is how they ever found time to write the large number of plays credited to - them .

		This difference between the poets of then and now is commented on by Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	in his recent book .

		`` Euripides and his Age . ''

		He remarks : `` Our poets and men of letters mostly live either by writing or by investments eked out by writing .

		They are professional writers and readers and , as a rule , nothing else .

		It is com - paratively rare for any one of them to face daily dangers , to stand against men who mean to kill him and beside men for whom he is ready to die , to be kept a couple of days fast - ing , or even to work in the sweat of his body for the food he eats .

		If such things happen by accident to one of us we cherish them as price - less ` copy , ' or we even go out of our way to compass the experience artificially . ''

		It was this abundant dose of realism in actual hard , grinding , unlovely experience that so effectu - ally disinclined the ancients to realism in literature , and gave , especially to the Greek writers , their firm hold on sanity and common sense , their avoidance of sentimentality and paradox and all sorts of foolishness know r n to us of the twentieth century . ' '

		A man everlast - ingly wrapped round in good books and safe living cries out for something harsh and real for blood and swear-words and crude jagged sentences .

		A man who escapes with eagerness from a life of war and dirt and brutality and hardship to dwell just a short time among the Muses , naturally likes the Muses to be their very selves and not remind him of the mud he has just washed off . ''

		Hence Euripides , who knew only too well the horrors and the ghastli - ness of real warfare , gives us only conven - tionalized and sterilized descriptions of battle , while the modern poet , who has never faced a loaded gun , revels in the gory details of mar - tial combat .

		But after all is said that must be said in praise of Greek sanity and propor - tion and restraint and sound common sense , it still remains unproved that these qualities are attainable only through experience of the ferocities of war .

		At any rate , there is a manifest difference between the hand-to-hand combats of antiquity and the modern whole - sale slaughter of the machine gun and the dynamite bomb ... FICTION AND FACT sometimes repeat each other rather closely .

		`` We of peaceful Lon - don city have never beheld and please God never shall witness such a scene of hurry and alarm as that which
Brussels	LOCATION	presented .

		Crowds rushed to the
Namur	LOCATION	gate , from which direction the noise proceeded , and many rode along the level chaussee , to be in advance of any intelligence from the army .

		Each man asked his neighbor for news ; and even great English lords and ladies condescended to speak to persons whom they did not know .

		The friends of the French went abroad , wild with excitement ... The merchants closed their shops , and came out to swell the general chorus of alarm and clamor .

		Women rushed to the churches , and crowded the chapels , and knelt and prayed on the flags and steps .

		The dull sound of the cannon went on rolling , roll - ing .

		Presently carriages with travellers be - gan to leave the town , galloping away by the Ghent barrier . ''

		... That is not copied from a newspaper of the present year and month , but from the thirty-second chapter of ' ' Vanity Fair , '' in which the panic attending the bat - tle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, almost a. century ago , is so stirringly depicted .

		Side by side with that chapter may be placed many a true account of present-day conditions in the same region , and it is hard to decide whether the romancer or the veracious historian is the more vividly realistic .

		Here is a passage from a private letter received a few days ago .

		It will ex - plain itself . ' '

		Such crowds !

		We got on all right , and all had seats , though it was a won - der ... There was much doubt as to whether we should not be stopped at the frontier , as the train was not allowed to cross the border .

		However , when we reached there
AVC	ORGANIZATION	found another train waiting for us in all about four hundred or five hundred people .

		In the mad rush and scramble for seats we had to get into a third-class carriage , which , as you know , on the continent has hard board seats .

		We rode in that ` cattle car ' from 11 o'clock P.M. to 5 :30
A.M.	LOCATION	, when we finally reached the
Hook of Holland	ORGANIZATION	.

		You can imagine it if you want to try , but you could never realize what it was like ... All through
Germany	LOCATION	we saw train loads of soldiers and of the recruits who had been taken from their work .

		It 's all horrible and awful .

		When we reached the boat we found it already crowded beyond
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 189 its usual capacity of four hundred , and there were four hundred more to get on .

		I never saw such a sight people lying on the deck and everywhere .

		The only thing we could do was to sit on our luggage on the deck , like the steerage . ''

		The writer of this , an American woman just recovering from a long illness , probably had her mind too much occupied with nearer concerns to admit of comparing her situation with that of the characters in the above-named chapter .

		She finally reached .

		safety in
London	LOCATION	.

		A BOOK FOR THE PRESENT HOUR , though it is a book just twenty-five years old this coming season , is the
Baroness von Suttner	PERSON	's `` Die
Waff	ORGANIZATION	en Nieder '' a title that has been vari - ously rendered in the several English transla - tions of the work .

		`` Lay Down Your Arms '' is perhaps as good an English equivalent as has been hit upon in these versions .

		A curious and little-known circumstance in connection with the book 's original publication is the difficulty its author experienced in finding a publisher courageous enough to face the ex - pected public disapproval and governmental displeasure at the appearance of so vehement a protest , even though in the form of fiction , against the prevailing militarism of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Serial publication was first attempted , with repeated failure , no editor being able to per - suade himself that his reading public would tolerate so revolutionary a piece of writing .

		AVhen at last , the hope of serial issue being abandoned , a publisher was found for the story as a book , much hesitation was shown by him about venturing an un expurgated edition ; he wished to submit the work to an experi - enced statesman with the request that all passages likely to give offence be struck out .

		But of course the author indignantly refused to consent to this .

		Then the timid publisher pleaded for a change of title , the substitution of some meaningless and innocuous word or words in place of the ringing command chosen by the writer .

		Finally the
Baroness	PERSON	had her way , and the rest is a part of literary history , how the book made an instant success even in circles where its kindly reception had been least of all expected ; how it was speedily translated into a dozen languages , with two or more versions in our own tongue ; and how the author was nearly overwhelmed with con - gratulatory letters from readers and admirers , high and low .

		Strangely enough , however , among the disapproving minority were num - bered readers of the author 's own sex , wives and mothers who clung to the foolish notion that war is romantic , the breeder of chivalry , the begetter of heroes .

		When
Europe	LOCATION	shall have recovered somewhat from its present fit of madness , the book is likely to have a second and , it may be , a more fruitful reading .

		At the same time , too , or even sooner , it will be no waste of one 's leisure to read , or re-read , the history of the book and of its writer in the `` Memoirs of
Bertha von Suttner	PERSON	, '' which came out in
Germany	LOCATION	six years ago , in
this country two years later	DATE	.

		LIBRARY SCIENCE AS A REFORMATORY AGENT remains to be recognized by the penologists and criminologists and prison-reformers .

		In a recent contribution to `` The Survey '' is described the regenerative effect of cataloguing and classification and other work called for in the operation of a certain unnamed prison library , whose custodian was one of the invol - untary inmates of the institution and had at first shown a lawless and arbitrary disposition in his administration of the department as - signed to his charge .

		But an expert librarian , called in by the warden , led this erratic person -LRB- by a process similar to that of giving a man sufficient rope to hang himself -RRB- to see the time-consuming , labor-wasting error of his headstrong ways , and at last `` the mind that once was only interested in picking locks and pulling off bank robberies found more con - genial problems in the intricacies of decimal classification .

		Library science had pointed the way .

		LIBRARY SPIRIT UNQUELLED BY EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE has been splendidly shown in the restoring of
San Francisco	LOCATION	's public library , which suffered annihilation in
1906	DATE	, but began to rise again from its ruins the same year , and to-day , as we are informed by its librarian , `` stands not only rehabilitated in every de - partment , but has exceeded its former growth . ''

		Its former number of volumes , as stated in `` News Notes of
California	LOCATION	Libraries , '' was about 166,344 , and its present number is 144,360 , which seems to leave a deficit still to be made good in that item of equipment ; but there is no reason to doubt its present in - creased activity , especially as we are told that `` a chain of branch libraries to aggregate in value
$ 375,000	MONEY	has been commenced , as well as the new main library building , '' which , with its grounds , in the new civic centre of the city , will be valued at
two million dollars	MONEY	.

		Can it be that , like so many of our most prosperous cities , libraries too are capable of showing their utmost vigor only in the face of an appalling calamity ?

		190 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	EFFECT ON LITERARY PRODUCTION , especially in the combatant countries , is sure to be harmful for the time being .

		When the national energies are chiefly concentrated in a life-and-death struggle , there is little sur - plus vitality for literature , though the rebound after the return of peace , more particularly if it is a peace achieved by victory , is likely to be marked by a vigorous revival of letters .

		A prominent American publisher who has just returned from
London	LOCATION	takes a cheerful and confident view of the situation in the book market .

		Admitting that for the present every - one is reading the newspapers , and little else , he foresees an early reaction and a renewed desire for literature as distinguished from war bulletins ; and even though the pocket-book may show some flatness as a result of present abnormal conditions , the enforced economies he believes will be in the line of jewelry and other costly trinkets rather than in books .

		In fact , Christmas presents are likely to take the form of books this year , in place of the more expensive articles that a fuller purse would prompt one to buy .

		This is cheering , both to the producers of literary wares and to those who are interested in the spread of culture .

		Certain classes of books are singled out as not unlikely to be in especial demand because of the w r ar , including works descriptive of the countries engaged in the conflict , political and other writings throwing light on the issues involved , travel sketches from the pens of those caught in the maelstrom of international combat , and , not least of all , diverting novels as a relief and a refreshment after this super - abundance of horrors from the battlefield .

		So far as our own country is immediately con - cerned , the authority here cited admits that the import of books will suffer a temporary diminution , and American authors must wait for better times before they can reap large profits from the European sale of their works , but in general an early return to nearly normal conditions in our book-trade is ex - pected .

		... PARLIAMENTARY POETICS , such as have graced the proceedings of few deliberative bodies observing the rules of Gushing or of
Robert	LOCATION	, marked the closing session of the late annual convention of the
California Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Coronado	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the resolutions presented for adoption we are refreshed by the following rhapsodic passages : ' ' Nor shall we forget the music , and our good fortune to have so freely given from voice and finger tips the thrilling charms and charming thrills that come from depths unseen .

		We thank those who spent the eager night in planning , the busy day arranging , all for our physical comfort , our homely entertainment .

		We found our strenuous days were left behind , and we have simply breathed and looked and joyed out - side the meeting door . ''

		Who shall say now that library work begets a barren pedantry , a juiceless addiction to routine , a dry-as-dust devotion to infinitesimal minutige ?

		It is to the current issue of `` News Notes of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia Libraries '' that we are indebted for the foregoing frolics -LRB- there are more unquoted -RRB- of a resolutions committee not dead to the de - lights of rhetoric and the pleasures of poetry .

		THE AUTHOR OF `` THE GREAT ILLUSION , '' the remarkable book that four years ago called attention to the preposterous folly of war , its economic absurdity , its political unwisdom , and its irreconcilable antagonism to the spirit of civilization and progress , is by birth an American , as it may be of interest to note at this time , and his real name is
Ralph Norman Angell Lane	PERSON	, of which he uses the second and third constituents as a pseudonym -LRB- though that word is not strictly applicable in this instance -RRB- , a pseudonym now familiar to read - ers of a score of nationalities , for thus widely has the treatise been disseminated in trans - lation and in its original tongue .

		As to the origin of the book , it was first written , in less expanded form , as a pamphlet by Mr.
Lane	PERSON	in the odd moments snatched from his duties as editor of the
Paris	LOCATION	edition of the
London	LOCATION	' ' Daily Mail , ' ' and , its tone being out of harmony with that journal 's editorial policy , it appeared independently under the title , ``
Europe	LOCATION	's Optical Illusion . ''

		At first it seemed to have been still-born , not a single reviewer giving it any notice for six weeks or two months .

		Then a distinguished public man in
England	LOCATION	recognized its importance and wrote to the author , after which three
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean sovereigns also testified their interest by letter , and the early sequel was a revised and
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 191 extended form of the work , under its present well-known title .

		A quotation pertinent to present issues may be worth while in this place .

		`` Ten years after the war -LSB- of
1870	DATE	-RSB-
Germany	LOCATION	was a great deal worse off financially than her rival , and was trying , as she is trying to-day , to borrow money from her victim .

		... We know that
Bismarck	PERSON	's later life was clouded by the spectacle of what he regarded as an absurd miracle , the vanquished recover - ing more quickly than the victor . ' '

		When the turmoil now raging shall have subsided , it may be that the world will turn once more to Mr.
Lane	PERSON	's book with an increased disposition to profit by its teachings .

		THE ART OF TYPOGRAPHY is discussed and illustrated in an agreeable and instructive manner by the editor of `` The Newarker . ''

		Possibly he would not call typography an art , as he says `` the printer is next door to the artist . ''

		Well , let us imagine a communicating passage between the two houses , and so inti - mate an intercourse between their occupants that the man of types unconsciously imbibes , or inhales , something of his neighbor 's artist spirit .

		Certainly the designing of type is an art .

		That master typographer , the late Theo - dore Low De
Vinne	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Dana	PERSON	quotes , declares that `` a prosperous printer will be more successful when he can inspire the buyers of printing in all its forms with the under - standing that meritorious printing is really a worthy branch of the fine arts . ''

		A passage from ' ' The
Newarker	PERSON	' ' is worth quoting here : `` Volumes have been written on plain type faces .

		The subject is most fascinating .

		Print - ing is ever before our eyes .

		If you study how it affects you , you will soon find that mere legibility , as you first regard it , is not enough to commend a type face to you for all time . ''

		Nevertheless , just as good architecture implies suitability of form and arrangement and ornamentation to the purposes of the building , so the most legible type has the best chance of being the most lastingly pleasing to the eye .

		Every book season sees at least a few new experiments in odd and fantastic type-designs .

		All readers are familiar , for example , with the slanting which makes its disfiguring appear - ance now and then amid letters of irreproach - able rectitude .

		It is not an instance of ' ' wrong font , ' ' but a deliberately committed sin against both good taste and clear legibility .

		Other absurd departures from typographic sanity will be recalled by any observant student of print .

		Simplicity and modesty , freedom from a foolish desire to attract attention by eccen - tricity , are as essential to good typography as to polite behavior .

		EDUCATIONAL SIDE SHOWS , to appropriate an expressive term of President
Wilson	PERSON	's , are incidentally referred to in the course of an article in the
September	DATE	`` Atlantic Monthly '' on `` The Critics of the Colleges '' by President
Henry S. Pritchett	PERSON	of the
Carnegie Founda	LOCATION	- tion for the
Advancement of Teaching	ORGANIZATION	.

		He says : `` Many colleges lend the shelter of their charters to various technical or profes - sional schools which they neither support nor control , such as conservatories of music , com - mercial schools , medical schools , engineering schools , and graduate schools .

		Many a good college which guards its bachelor-of-arts de - gree with watchful care will , without the quiver of an eyelash , shelter a weak engineer - ing school or a commercial medical school of the lowest type .

		The tenderest part of the college conscience lies apparently in the bach - elor-of-arts course , and the most callous in the medical course . ' '

		Another significant passage from this high educational authority is worth quoting here : `` The amount of fraud con - nected with the business of soliciting money for colleges will astonish any one who has not looked into it .

		There are enterprises in this country bearing the name of college or uni - versity which have never taught a class , which have not a single college building , but which have for years collected money from a con - fiding public . ''

		President
Pritchett	PERSON	's article is of obvious timeliness at this opening of the academic year , and deserves careful attention from educators , students and their parents , philanthropic millionaires annually bled for the benefit of commercial enterprises calling themselves educational , and all whom the cause of real education directly or indirectly concerns .

		A BIBLICAL SETTLEMENT OF THE SHAKE - SPEARE-BACON QUESTION ought to be con - clusive .

		At the late meeting called by the British Academy to concert plans for the approaching celebration of the tri-centennial of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's death , the Archbishop of Canterbury appropriately and wittily called attention to the fact that the great actor - playwright retired from the exercise of his calling at the age of forty-six , in the year
1611	DATE	, the year that witnessed the publication of the Authorized Version of the
Bible	LOCATION	, and that some ingenious person has made the re - markable discovery that if one opens at the forty-sixth Psalm in that version and counts the words from the beginning , the forty-sixth word will be found to be `` spear , '' while the same process of counting from the end of the same Psalm -LRB- omitting its concluding `` selah '' -RRB- will establish the significant fact that the forty-sixth word is ' ' shake . ' '

		In spite of an ele - 192 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	merit of the topsy-turvy in this demonstration , or perhaps because of it , it is of precisely the character that should carry conviction to all having a taste and aptitude for the method of reasoning so ably expounded in `` The Great Cryptogram '' and later treatises of a similar ingenious character .

		It is true we are by no means certain that the precise year of Shake - speare 's retirement from
London	LOCATION	to the peace - ful quiet of
New Place	LOCATION	,
Stratford	LOCATION	, was
1611	DATE	, that event being commonly assigned to ' ' about the year
1610	DATE	, '' but we should not let such a trifle upset the foregoing neat little demon - stration that
Shakespeare	PERSON	wrote his own works and also translated the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		THE INFLUENCE OF THE FRENCH PRESS , felt to be not inconsiderable by the French them - selves , was humorously admitted in that jocose remark of Prince von Biilow concerning a dis - tinguished editorial writer on foreign affairs in the
Paris	LOCATION	`` Temps . ''

		There are in
Europe	LOCATION	, he is quoted as saying , `` three great Powers and
M. Tardieu	PERSON	. ''

		As a recent proof of this potency of the
Paris	LOCATION	journalist 's pen may be cited a late occurrence of some significance to us just now , mentioned in
Count Vassili	LOCATION	's ' '
France	LOCATION	from Behind the Veil . ' '

		The author says : `` Indeed in no country do newspapers wield such an influence as they do in
France	LOCATION	, where the bourgeois , the workman , and the peasant believe implicitly in what the papers say , especially if his particular news-sheet has the chauvinistic opinions which he himself espouses .

		It would hardly have been possible to organize the magnificent reception which was awarded to the Emperor of
Russia	LOCATION	, if newspapers of all shades had not contributed to it their long articles written in praise of the future visitor and in general of the Rus - sian nation and the Russian army .

		These were material factors in securing the popular dem - onstration that took place .

		Thanks to them the Russian loans were covered several times over , and Russian policy , be it in the East or elsewhere , was warmly supported by the powers that ruled at the Quai d'Orsay . ''

		To what extent the newspaper press is recognized and respected by the French government is partly illustrated at present by the facilities the journals enjoy for obtaining accurate official war news , as contrasted with the se - cretive and suspicious policy that seems to prevail in high quarters at
Berlin	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	.

		THE LITERARY LIFE AND THE ACTIVE LIFE have each its peculiar attractions and advan - tages .

		Which is likely to be the more useful , which the richer in present returns , and which in future fame , who can predict ?

		Some thoughtful utterances on this by no means novel but still unexhausted theme are con - tributed by Mr.
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	to the Sep - tember `` Century , '' in an essay bearing the well-worn caption , '' Literature and Life . ''

		Agreeably characteristic of the writer 's well - known manner is the following paragraph : ' ' And yet if , on the other hand , one compares the subsequent fame of men of action with the fame of men of letters , the contrast is indeed bewildering .

		Who attaches the small - est idea to the personality of the Lord Lich - field whom Dr.

		Who that adores the memory of
Wordsworth	PERSON	knows any - thing about Lord Goderich , a contemporary prime minister ?

		The world reads and re - reads the memoirs of dead poets , goes on pil - grimages to the tiny cottages where they lived in poverty , cherishes the smallest records and souvenirs of them .

		The names of statesmen and generals become dim except to professed historians , while the memories of great ro - mancers and lyrists , and even of lesser writers still , go on being revived and redecorated .

		What would
Keats	PERSON	have thought , as he lay dying in his high , hot , noisy room at
Rome	LOCATION	, if he had known that a century later every smallest detail of his life , his most careless letters , would be scanned by eager eyes , when few save historians would be able to name a single member of the cabinet in power at the time of his death ? ' '

		COMMUNICATION .

		THE WOMEN OF WAGNEB .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's brilliant leader on '' Lords of Mis - rule , '' in THE DIAL of
August 16	DATE	, is certainly con - vincing in so far as its main theses are concerned : but it seems to me that in one particular it exposes a misconception .

		Referring to
Wagner	PERSON	and
Nietzsche	PERSON	, he remarks : ''
Nietzsche	PERSON	revolted from
Wagner	PERSON	because of two things : the latter 's trend toward religion , even sacer -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 193 dotalism , and his attitude toward woman .

		Women in
Wagner	PERSON	always save the situation .

		They are the inspir - ers and regenerators of man .

		To Nietzsche , following
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, they were little better than animals . ''

		The ease of
Wagner	PERSON	contra
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is full of complexities .

		There has been an enormous amount of discussion of the relations between the two men , but it is improbable that they will ever fully be understood .

		Both the Wagnerites and the
Nietz	PERSON	- scheans befog the issue by partisanship , and as they are in possession of some of the most im - portant data , which they give to the world as , and in the form which , they see fit , the truth can not , now at least , be more than approximated , despite the utterances of the principals themselves .

		But , sifting those facts of which we can be sure , the overshadowing reason for the estrangement , fol - lowing the close intimacy , between the composer and the philosopher was the thorough , not to say colossal , egotism which they shared in common .

		It was impossible that two such '' supermen '' should long revolve in the same orbit .


Wagner	PERSON	, most particularly , was in his own circle the sun and its other members satellites and sun-worship - pers .

		He had no use for anyone whom he could not use , to express it plainly .

		Nietzsche had sought him out in a gush of enthusiasm and idealistic fellow-feeling , and he cherished the de - lusion , for several years , that this feeling was returned in kind .

		When he realized , at length , that it was not , that he had been made welcome at
Triebschen	ORGANIZATION	and Wahnfried not for himself alone , but for what he was worth as a mouthpiece for the propaganda of their pontiff , his attitude changed .

		This , certainly , was the prime factor that made for the rupture , although it is certain that the diverging ideals of the two men , reinforced by their intense individualism , must in the end have separated them .

		But of one thing there is ample evidence ' namely , their opinions and treatment of women .

		While
Nietzsche	PERSON	wrote very bitterly of them , his personal conduct was far different .

		His life , con - sidering his era and environment , was unusually clean , despite the fact that letters recently dis - covered are said to establish the existence of an unacknowledged daughter , for whose welfare he cherished the liveliest concern .

		His philosophical doctrines regarding '' the sex '' and his personal relations with them seem to have been decidedly at variance .

		When master of his faculties he was always a gentleman , and those women with whom lie was friendly found him a delightful , even lovable companion .

		The manner of
Wagner	PERSON	with women was strik - ingly dissimilar .

		Upon his own confession his moral lapses began early and they never ceased until , late in life , he concluded a lengthy series of affaires by eloping with the wife of his best friend .

		He had an inveterate propensity for making love to the wives of men to whom he was deeply obli - gated , and his minor peccadilloes were frequent .

		Much sympathy has been solicited for him because of his unfortunate first marriage but , as a matter of fact , while
Minna Planer	PERSON	was not blame - less ,
Wagner	PERSON	was well aware of her '' past '' and indifferent to it .

		Indeed , we look in vain through - out his long life for any trace of a real ethical sense in his relationships with women or his atti - tude toward them , and the more closely we scru - tinize the evidence the more clearly the truth appears that he regarded them , socially , as instru - ments for the gratification of his passions , the furtherance of his ambitions , and the purveyance of his creature comforts .

		That '' Women in
Wagner	PERSON	always save the situation '' ; that '' They are the inspirers and regenerators of man , '' can not be established from the study of his works .

		He did conceive , at one period of his career , the curious idea which has been traced to various sources but whose origin is immaterial that man any man who through his own misdeeds had jeopardized his fate , here and hereafter could be '' redeemed '' if some woman would sacrifice herself for him .

		The idea is fantastic and
Wagner	PERSON	talked and wrote much about it in an equally fantastic way but analysis of his music-dramas reveals the fact that they support it very lamely and still more limitedly .

		Nothing of the kind can be traced in his first opera , ''
Rienzi	PERSON	, '' a mere pot-boiler , a-la-Meyerbeer , written around a libretto derived from the romance by
Bulwer	PERSON	.

		The '' redemption '' scheme does , how - ever , appear in his next one , his first truly Wag - nerian production , '' The Flying Dutchman . ''

		The Dutchman had wantonly offended the Deity and his offence could only be atoned for by the devoted love and voluntary self-sacrifice of a pure maiden , a role which he allotted to
Senta	LOCATION	.

		But
Senta	PERSON	does not inspire , neither does she regenerate , Van - derdecken .

		On the contrary , he inspires her with a romantic passion only possible to a German heroine , and , when he becomes aware of it , turns to her as a sort of '' first aid to the injured . ''

		But he speedily turns away again , and in the last act we behold him casting her off and sailing out to sea without her , whereupon she insists on throwing herself into the bay .

		To be sure we are then regaled with a '' tableau '' in which
Vanderdecken	ORGANIZATION	and
Senta	PERSON	are represented as ascending to heaven , quite like Little
Eva	PERSON	in ''
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin , '' or Marguerite in ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' while the demon ship sinks forever beneath the waves .

		Perhaps , after a fash - ion , this fulfils Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's stipulations , but it does so in a theatrical sense only .

		Otherwise , the entire opera is a farrago of absurdities , which had long since been forgotten but for the magnificent music which it contains . ''

		Tannhauser '' followed the '' Dutchman . ''

		Here also we get the '' redemption '' motive .

		The heroine ,
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, dies in the last act , supposably from a broken heart at the non-return from
Rome	LOCATION	of the hero , who has gone on pilgrimage there as peni - tence for a prolonged sojourn in the
Venusberg	LOCATION	.

		Poor
Elizabeth	PERSON	, like many of her sex , could not wait .

		Had she done so a little longer Tannhauser would have returned to her safe and sound and forgiven for his sins , for the rod had blossomed to betoken that fact .

		When he does return and finds her dead , he straightway recants his repentance and goes over to
Venus	PERSON	again which is not to be won - dered at when that goddess is impersonated , let us say , by Mine .

		Olive Fremstad , beside whom no Elizabeth of the present time has , to drop into the 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	vernacular , a ghost of a show .

		There is a closing intimation that Tannhauser will yet be saved by the intercessions of Elizabeth at the heavenly throne but of his salvation we can not , alas , help having grave misgivings .

		With these two excursions , the '' redemption '' idea seems to have palled on
Wagner	PERSON	, and with `` Lohengrin '' he abruptly transposes it into the masculine key .

		There are two female characters ,
Elsa	PERSON	and Ortrud .

		The latter is certainly one of the most malignant ladies known to opera , and her idea of saving the situation is , preferably , by murder .

		As for
Elsa	PERSON	, she has been pronounced , in the words of an ardent Wagnerian , '' a stupid , shallow , faithless creature , '' with the farther ver - dict that '' So pitiable a specimen of feminine inquisitiveness , bad temper and ungenerosity has never been put on the stage as the heroine of a grand opera . ''

		Lohengrin saves
Elsa	PERSON	from being burnt at the stake , and she requites him by vio - lating his most express and sacred injunction .

		Whereupon he promptly retires to the mystical realm of Montsalvat , whence he came ; where , we are assured , the suggestion of Plato regarding the ideal republic has been adopted and ladies are not persona grata . ''

		Tristan and Isolde '' is
Wagner	PERSON	's master-work , and from it we gather these items : That the heroine ,
Isolde	LOCATION	, first endeavored to poison the hero , but , the fatal draught having been changed by the faithful
Brangaene	PERSON	, who had other things in view and knew that to kill Tristan in the first act would never do , both partook of a love-potion , with entirely different results .

		Nevertheless , Isolde is not going to save Tristan , nor regenerate him .

		She does not even inspire him it was the potion which did that !

		But Isolde will be the death of him for , in the second act , although the perspi - cacious
Brangaene	PERSON	warns her that treachery is afoot , she insists upon calling Tristan into the garden , where they are surprised and
Melot	PERSON	gives him his death-blow .

		In the third act Tristan dies , and Isolde expires upon his corpse , after warbling the most beautiful swan-song in musical literature but how that saves the situation or otherwise does poor Tristan any good it is difficult to con - ceive .

		The '' Meistersinger '' is not opera seria , but glorified opera buffa .

		The heroine ,
Eva	PERSON	, does inspire the tenore di grazia ,
Walther	PERSON	, to the im - passioned improvisation of the '' Preisleid , '' to her own great joy as well as that of the audience ; but the saving of the situation is done by the real hero , good old
Hans Sachs	PERSON	whose virtue , inci - dentally , is his sole reward .

		As for Beckmesser , the one member of the cast cryingly in need of regeneration , he fails to experience it and is hooted out of sight .


Wagner	PERSON	's most stupendous achievement , the `` Ring , '' with its tetralogy of masterpieces , fails altogether to support Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's contention .

		It has many female characters , but
Briinnhilde	PERSON	is the supreme and central one .

		From her first appear - ance , in '' Die Walkiire , '' to her final immolation , in '' Gb ` tterdammerung , '' she is the sport of destiny and the prey of the gods .

		She would have
Sieg	ORGANIZATION	- mund , but can not .

		She succors
Sieglinde	PERSON	, but only until the latter gives birth to
Siegfried	LOCATION	, when she perishes miserably , like a hunted animal ;
Wotan	ORGANIZATION	, in the interim , having stripped Briinnhilde of her immortality and left her at the mercy of the first comer brave enough to penetrate the wall of flame with which she is surrounded .

		Siegfried proves the conquering hero but from the moment he links his fate with hers , his feet are set in the pathway to destruction .

		The '' situation '' goes from bad to worse , despite the frantic efforts of Briinnhilde ; woe is heaped upon woe , and the '' Ring '' closes with the downfall of gods , demi-gods , and mortals , '' in one red burial blent . ''

		The curse of the
Rhine	LOCATION	- gold has prevailed over them all .

		There is , I be - lieve , a work of several hundred pages , composed by a Perfect Wagnerite , with the impressive title , '' The Ethics of
Wagner	PERSON	's Ring of the Nibelungs . ''

		This may '' save the situation '' but
Briinnhilde	PERSON	could not .

		`` Parsifal , '' the work of his old age , was
Wagner	PERSON	's last opera .

		There is but one female character
Kundry	ORGANIZATION	.

		She begins as an infamous sort of a
Lamia	LOCATION	, against whose seductions Parsifal is , hap - pily , proof ; and ends as a penitent for whose transformation , or , indeed , presence , it is difficult to account .

		It has been said -LRB- by Mr.
Ernest New	PERSON	- man -RRB- that in
Kundry Wagner	PERSON	sought to limn '' the eternal and infernal womanly , the destroyer and the savior of man '' but that '' all we see upon the stage is a German prima-donna , stout of build and heavy of movement . ''

		Evidently Mr.
Newman	PERSON	never saw Mme. Fremstad as
Kundry	ORGANIZATION	, or this observation would not have escaped him .

		But Kundry neither saves , inspires , nor regenerates .

		She is a wicked temptress who becomes a peniten - tial handmaiden .

		The first guise , only , presents her to us in the active voice and then Parsifal turns from her in loathing and , having regenerated him - self , departs to dwell in mystical Montsalvat with Uncle or is it Papa ?

		Lohengrin ; who , as we know , had long since withdrawn there in order to get rid of
Elsa	PERSON	, and where , as previously stated , ladies , whether on salvation , inspiration , or regen - eration bent , are , as a placard would inform us in
Berlin	LOCATION	, verboten . ''

		Parsifal '' was
Wagner	PERSON	's farewell to his public .

		It is not exactly a glorification of the eternal fem - inine , but , after all , it does sum up his lifelong attitude toward femininity pretty accurately saving the fact that he was himself no Parsifal .

		For , in the beginning he liked to be tempted and to yield to temptation ; and , latterly , required a willing and self-effacing '' ministering angel . ''


Wagner	PERSON	was always
Wagner	PERSON	and , as regards women , beneath incredible inconsistencies his con - sistency never changed .

		He needed them , to '' save the situation '' for himself , in real life , from begin - ning to end .

		They also inspired him to the com - position of some of the world 's most wonderful music but they never regenerated him , just as they regenerated none of his heroes .

		That he re - garded them in any light except as ministers to his own pleasure , vanity , and comfort , no con - vincing proof exists .

		1914 -RSB- THE 195 Cbe BEHIND THE SCENES IN
PARIS	LOCATION	.

		* No small part of the interest awakened by Count
Paul Vassili	PERSON	's varied and vivid mem - ories , chiefly Parisian , which he entitles ``
France	LOCATION	from Behind the Veil , '' lies in the contrast between the picture he presents of childish irresponsibility and levity and help - lessness on the part of the people of the French capital just before the culmination of the trag - edy of forty-four years ago , and the present sober and wisely precautionary attitude of the same city in the face of a second similar sit - uation .

		Foolish self-confidence was fostered by the lying reports of military strength and preparedness with which his ministers and ad - visers deceived a ruler who was himself a past master in the arts of vain simulation and theatrical humbug .

		To-day , with far firmer ground beneath their feet , the people of
Paris	LOCATION	are nevertheless quietly preparing for the worst while hoping for the best .

		In
September of 1870	DATE	, as the writer had the best of oppor - tunities to note , '' Life went on just as usual , and save for a few expressions of wonder , no one seemed quite to realize the importance of it .

		The capital began to prepare for the siege , rather with mirth than with anything else .

		To tell the truth , no one seemed to believe in its possibility , and I remember one day , when visiting a friend who was living on the
Quai Malaquais	PERSON	, she pointed to the Seine flowing softly under her windows , saying at the same time : ' Croyez-vous que les Prussiens arriveront devant mes fenetres comme les Normands jadis sont entres a

Paris	LOCATION	during the siege , '' contains the following , so different in tone from the letters now coming to outsiders from the same quarter : '' The government does nothing , and when I have said this , I say everything .

		They say that they can do nothing and that it is to the Tours delega - tion they must look for an attempt to stop the progress of the Prussian army .

		So long as Gam - betta was here there was some activity in minis - terial offices ; now he has gone there is absolute stagnation .

		All these ministers , suddenly called upon to exercise functions for which they were totally unprepared , seem lost , and
Jules Favre	PERSON	looks at the political situation with the same eye he would look at some big criminal or civil law case from the outlook of an advocate , not from that of a statesman .

		They say he actually cried during his conversation with
Bismarck	PERSON	.

		The ques - tion arises whether these tears were genuine ones of grief , or simply a rhetorical incident . ''

		Readers of republican predilections will find in Count
Vassili	PERSON	's pages little reason to regret the downfall of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, though he paints the portrait of its sovereign in rather attractive colors and presents to us a quite ravishing albeit weak-minded
Empress Eu	ORGANIZATION	- genie .


Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		is seen at his best in the following paragraph : '' The Emperor 's was essentially a kind nature .

		During the eighteen years of his reign he did an enormous amount of good , and certainly
France	LOCATION	owes to him a good deal of her present prosperity .

		He thought about his people 's welfare more than had any previous Sovereign ; the economic ques - tion was one to which he had given his most earnest attention .

		He wanted his country to be strong , rich , an example to others in its energetic progress along the path of material and intel - lectual development .

		He was a lover of art ; he was a keen student , an admirer of literature ; and he appreciated clever men .

		Catholic in his tastes , he had the rare faculty of forgetting the wrongs done to him , in the remembrance of the many proofs of affection he had experienced .

		Gifted with a sweet and sunny temperament , he had been brought up in the school of adversity .

		Amidst all the grandeur that he enjoyed later on , he never forgot the lesson ; and when misfortune once more assailed him , he was never heard to murmur , or to reproach those whose incapacity had destroyed his life 's work . ''

		An incident that helps to strengthen the conviction that the Emperor was hurried into a rash war by unwise counselors is related by the author .

		When the Russian secretary went to congratulate
Napoleon	PERSON	on the gratifying results of the Plebiscite of
May , 1870	DATE	, that imperial personage , though it was most un - usual for him to compromise his dignity by such a demonstration of feeling , did not at - tempt to conceal his delight , but openly de - clared that the Plebiscite `` had not only 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	consolidated the dynasty , but also had done away with the legend that represented him as desirous of a foreign \ var in order to add to his prestige . ''

		He added exultantly : `` No one can say so at present , because , after
France	LOCATION	has so positively affirmed its allegiance to the Empire , it would be madness for me to risk losing popularity through a war which , even if victorious , would nevertheless mate - rially impoverish the country . ' '

		But he seems not to have noticed , or to have wilfully disre - garded , the fact that the vote of
Paris	LOCATION	was hostile to him ; and
Paris	LOCATION	then , as so often before , was potent in the making and unmak - ing of governments and rulers .

		From the many excellent pen portraits that the book contains , and that in fact make up the bulk of its contents , a few will here be chosen for partial reproduction .

		The artist lets us know that he had familiar access to all the most distinguished and interesting persons present in
Paris	LOCATION	at the time of his sojourn there , and we are not unwilling to accept his good offices and make their acquaintance through his pages .

		Of Thiers he writes : '' I had known him even before I came to
Paris	LOCATION	in an official capacity , had often seen him at the houses of some mutual friends , and we came to know each other very well .

		He was one of the cleverest , nicest little men in the world , and even among the many interesting people who abounded in
France	LOCATION	at that time he stood out conspicuously as one of the pleasantest .

		He had many enemies , which is not to be wondered at if one takes into consideration the vivacity which he always dis - played in his likes and dislikes , and the bitterness , or rather the caustic tendencies , of his tongue .

		But friends and foes alike were loud in their praise of his intelligence , and especially of his wit ... During the whole reign of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	,
M. Thiers	PERSON	Avas a conspicuous figure in
Paris	LOCATION	society , and , strange to relate , this petit bourgeois had succeeded in entering the most exclusive circles of the
Faubourg St. Germain	ORGANIZATION	, and contrived to install himself in the favours of its leaders , masculine as well as feminine .

		He was essentially the type of a middle-class man , in spite of the high offices which he had held , and never could rid himself of the habit of tying a napkin round his neck at meals , when he was in his family circle , neither would he go out without the umbrella that remained the distinctive sign of that epoch still known as the ' epoque de
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	/ where the bourgeoisie reigned supreme , and where the Sovereign tried by all means to win for himself the sympathies of the mob by coming - down to its level . ''

		The following characteristic passage gives a glimpse of a recently deceased French writer of note . ''

		I have met most of the celebrities of modern
France	LOCATION	at the
Due d'Aumale	ORGANIZATION	's lunches .

		He was very catholic as to the people whom he invited , and only required them to be amiable and to listen well to him , without attempting to interrupt .

		Among his great friends was
Jules Leinaitre	PERSON	, the Academician , an amusing , intelligent little man , rather void of manners , who buzzed about in a way that would have been aggressive had it not been so funny .

		He was full of wit , but sometimes said gauche things , the value of which did not appear to strike his otherwise critical mind . ''

		Concerning another and a greater author , and his chief work , the following is of in - terest : ''
Taine	PERSON	used to spend the greater part of the year at
Menthon	LOCATION	, in
Savoy	LOCATION	, on the borders of the
Lake of Annecy	LOCATION	, and it was during a visit which I paid him there , from Aix-les-Bains , where I was undergoing a cure , that I had with him the longest and perhaps the most interesting conversation in the whole time of our intercourse with each other .

		We discussed many subjects , and among others his great work , the '
Origines de la France Contem	ORGANIZATION	- poraine . '

		... He hated anarchy , lie thought it his duty to show it up in all its vivid horror , and he tried to write the story of that tragedy with the same impartiality he would have brought to bear on the description of it in any other country than his own .

		As he told me on that day : l C'est un pauvre patriotisme que celui qui s ` imagine que
Fon	ORGANIZATION	doit excuser les crimes de son pays , simplement par ce qu'on en est un citoyen . ' ''

		In this connection may be noted the author 's rather rash assertion , on an earlier page , that ' ' patriotism with Frenchmen is mostly a ques - tion of words ; it rarely goes beyond phrases , full of enthusiasm but devoid of real mean - ing . ''

		French love of country and French readiness to make the last sacrifice for coun - try are too well attested , too apparent at this very moment , to admit of question ; and the author himself , in the course of his narrative , cites several instances of conspicuously patri - otic conduct on the part of distinguished Frenchmen he has known .

		The writer believes himself to have made a few original contributions to French history of the later nineteenth century .

		For example , he was one of those who visited the Tuileries on the
evening	TIME	of that memorable fourth of
September	DATE	which saw the fall of
Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		No one then knew what had become of the Empress , though all sorts of rumors were in the air , and when he visited the Palace he found that no one there believed she had taken flight .

		`` Indeed , '' he adds `` and this is a detail that I believe has never been recorded elsewhere I found one of her maids pre - paring her bed as usual ! ''

		And again , speak - ing of the Comte de Chambord , he says : ' ' One has spoken of the flag and of the reluctance of the Pretender to accept the tricolour , but what has never been revealed to this day is that a compromise had been suggested by a clever French politician who had been con -
1914	DATE	j THE DIAL 197 suited . ''

		This compromise was that the tri - colour should continue to be the national flag while the white banner of his ancestors should be the new monarch 's personal emblem and be borne before him on all occasions of ceremony .

		But even this not dishonorable arrangement was finally rejected by the high-principled de - scendant of
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		The details of this affair the writer believes have not hitherto been fully understood by the world at large .

		Like his former work , `` Behind the Veil at the Russian Court , '' Count
Vassili	PERSON	's present volume is full of the curious political infor - mation possibly sometimes misinformation - and personal gossip with which a veteran diplomat is likely to find his memory well stored as he looks back over his professional career , and he writes in a way to hold the attention , though his anonymous translator leaves something to be desired on his part .

		The work is well illustrated .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		DRUMMOND OF HAWTHOKNDEN .

		* When one sees
William Drummond	PERSON	of Haw - thornden \ vhose very name along with
Kit Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	's and
Michael Drayton	PERSON	's had such a special fragrance for
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, in a smartly bound two-volume edition with an ap - paratus of cuts , variant readings , and notes on sources that would do credit to an editor of a Greek poet , one is likely to receive such a labor of love with a rather absurd ungraciousness .

		One remembers the epitaph which
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	, in a lovely sonnet , requested Sir
William Alexander	PERSON	to engrave on his stone . ''

		Here
Damon	PERSON	lies , whose songs did sometime grace , The murmuring Esk ; may roses shade the place ! ''

		Turning from these quiet-colored lines , one feels for a moment that such a monumental edition of
Drummond	PERSON	as that of Professor
Kastner	PERSON	is in positively bad taste .

		To be sure this is largely dilettanteish sentimentality .

		Yet Professor
Kastner	PERSON	has not given us the
Drummond	PERSON	that we are likely to pull down from our shelves over and over again .

		And we have a right to tax him with leaving his edition so meagre in intimate , beautiful utterances about
Drummond	PERSON	by famous critics , We have a right to tax the editor with his own severe refusal to say much of anything him - self about
Drummond	PERSON	, except to weigh gen - eral estimates coldly , to make bare citations * POETICAL WORKS OP

		of sources , to list editions and portraits .

		Of course , this is the orthodox way of producing critical editions under the shadow of universi - ties .

		And Professor
Kastner	PERSON	has done the orthodox thing with a care that reveals his patient years of research .

		But why must such work be forever divorced from the utterances quaint and shrewd and magical that might tempt a few who are not literary ascetics to turn the pages of this charming old recluse who proves after all to be so far the reverse of ascetic himself ?

		Is it not as important to quote and comment at length on the odd but strangely acute phrases of
Milton	LOCATION	's nephew ,
Edward Phillips	PERSON	, for instance , as to unearth an obscure Italian source of a love-sonnet ?

		To me that estimate of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	which
David Masson	PERSON	has so plausibly conjectured to show the influence of
Milton	LOCATION	himself is a phrase that , should be carefully weighed in every com - plete edition .

		Drummond , says
Phillips	PERSON	or
Milton	LOCATION	, was ' ' A genius the most polite and ver - dant that ever the Scottish nation produced . ' '

		The ideal editor of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	should write a paragraph on that one bizarre but most ex - pressive word ' ' verdant . ' '

		For while
Drummond	PERSON	's amorous and reli - gious poetry seems to the reader , in the languor that
Drummond	PERSON	often begets , to be alike in a golden monotone there is in that golden mono - tone a quiet life that is perpetually alluring however close the dependence on a model or however interminable the recurrence of fa - vored and self-indulging phrases .

		Whoever the French or Italian whom
Drummond	PERSON	bet - tered , whatever the reiteration of subject or mood , there is the transforming alchemy of the man
Drummond	PERSON	and his beloved retreat Hawthornden which
David Masson	PERSON	has de - scribed in a manner which now seems of an archaic school of criticism because of its tinge of sentimentalism and its incorrigibly garru - lous ways , but which , faded as it may be , has that faint fragrance about it which does not lull but quietly awakens .

		You ponder at lei - sure with the critic about the origin of certain mysterious caves said to be once the hiding place of Bruce and you wonder whether they were the dark strongholds of ancient Pictish kings . ''

		Whether of Pictish antiquity , or of later , puzzles your powers of conjecture ; but it is witli an increased respect for the whole mansion that you emerge again in the open air , after having seen what ghastly secrecies of some inscrutable past underlie its rocky foundations .

		It is with this sense that after observing whatever else is ap - parent to close inspection of the exterior , you continue the walk which leads from it , on one side of the romantic glen , in the direction of
Roslin	LOCATION	.

		Turning in this path to look at the house now and 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	again , at points where there is an opening through the trees , you see it as artists most delight to take it , a tall mass of gables and pinnacles shooting aloft from its crazy socket in the ravine .

		So leaving it , you may follow the path till it brings you down to a wooden bridge crossing the Esk .

		This bridge has a gate on it , so constructed that , if you pass through , you can not reopen it from the other side .

		If you do pass it , you are in the public pathway , two miles of which will take you , still through the depths of the glen , with the stream now on your left , to the castle and
Chapel of Roslin	ORGANIZATION	.

		But , if you would rather keep the sen - sation of Hawthornden unmixed , then , though it is unusual , there is nothing to prevent you from stopping your walk at the bridge and retracing your steps so as to renew your sight of the house in all the aspects in which you have already beheld it , only in reversed order .

		A noble old sycamore , just in front of the house , five hundred years old at least , may then arrest your attention , as well as the clipped clumps of yew which you noticed before .

		And so , regaining the road by the ascend - ing avenue , you have seen
Hawthornden	PERSON	and will remember it forever . ''

		This pleasant glimpse of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's re - treat , with some reflection about the pecu - liarly melancholy , yet serene life-giving magic which we may well assume to be its perennial properties , will help us as we read the poems themselves to understand precisely that sober freshness in
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's style which
Milton	PERSON	or
Phillips	PERSON	described with the queer but most happy adjective `` verdant . ''

		But all this places a little too much empha - sis on
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	, the dreamer .

		All supreme artists are equally dreamers and doers .

		Drum - mond was not a supreme artist and his dream - ing overbalanced his doing .

		But in order to appreciate fully his poetry we must remember that he was not a mere dreamer .

		To be sure his dabblings in military mechanics -LRB- in which he emulated at a great distance the versatility of Leonardo da
Vinci	PERSON	and other supreme artists of the Renaissance -RRB- , are not reassuring .

		King
Charles	PERSON	granted the poet a letter patent for a number of proposed inventions includ - ing among more than a dozen others equally miraculous : '' Instruments of the mortar or siphon kind whereof the one , on account of its signal use in defending walls and ships , and its truly wonderful speed , is called nTMToaKefiaannov , vulgarly , The Flat -
Scourer	PERSON	; the other , because of its special utility for shattering the masts , sails , rigging , and oars of ships , receives the name '' EvOvrftriTiKov , vulgarly , The Cutter . ''

		We turn with a smile from
Drummond	PERSON	the mechanic to
Drummond	PERSON	the politician .

		Here we find him , like
Milton	PERSON	, with a song dying on his lips as he turns eagerly to write politi - cal pamphlets but not on
Milton	ORGANIZATION	's side .

		Drummond does not seem to have gone much from his quiet retreat in his long and quixotic championship of
King Charles	LOCATION	.

		But his pen proved fluent and very cogent .

		Let the poet 's readers remember his defiant pamphlets writ - ten when the Puritans were rapidly sweeping over all .

		Judicious readers can then return to the richly colored courtier poems that came from quiet Hawthornden with a feeling that they glow more with conviction than with a base fire for preferment .

		Eeaders may even return with a delighted smile to that most attractive youthful hyperbole in `` Teares on the Death of Moeliades '' -LRB- 1613 -RRB- ,
Drummond	PERSON	's first publication , an elegy on the early death of
Prince Henry	ORGANIZATION	so widely mourned by the young poets of the Jacobean era . ''

		Moeliades , that by Ister 's streams , Amongst shrill-sounding trumpets , naming gleams Of warm encrimsoned swords , and cannons ' roar , Balls thick as rain poured by the Caspian shore , Amongst crushed lances , ringing helms and shields , Dismembered bodies ravishing the fields In Turkish blood made red like Mars 's star , Thou ended hadst thy life and Christian war ; Or , as brave Burbon ; thou hadst made old
Rome	LOCATION	, Queen of the world , thy triumph 's place and tomb !

		And in dear arras virgins fair had wrought The bays and trophies to thy country brought ; While some new Homer , imping pens to fame , Deaf Nilus ' dwellers had made hear thy name . ''

		Readers remembering
Drummond	PERSON	's unflinch - ing loyalty in the dark days of the Stuarts will also read from a later poem , with a de - light unalloyed by morbid distrust , these charmingly inappropriate and fantastic prom - ises to King James if he will but tarry long in his visit to
Scotland	LOCATION	. ''

		The wanton wood-nymphs of the verdant
spring	DATE	Blue golden , purple flowers shall to thee bring ;
Pomona	LOCATION	's fruits the panisks ; Thetis ' girls Thy
Thule	LOCATION	's amber with the ocean pearls ; The Tritons , herdsmen of the glassy field , Shall give thee what far-distant shores can yield , The Serian fleeces , Erythrean gems ,
Vast Plata	LOCATION	's silver gold or
Peru	LOCATION	streams , Antarctic parrots , Ethiopian plumes , Sabaean odours , myrrh , and sweet perfumes ; And I , myself , wrapt in a watchet gown , Of reeds and lilies on my head a crown , Shall incense to thee burn , green altars raise , And yearly sing due paeans to thy praise . ''

		But the court poems are too garish to repre - sent what , despite
Drummond	PERSON	's love of con - ventional mannerisms , I have called his sober freshness .

		His love poems will serve our pur - pose better .

		Here we find the recluse .

		Con - tent in his own words , `` Content with my books and the use of my eyes , I learnt even from boyhood to live beneath my fortune ; and
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 199 dwelling by myself as much as I can , I neither sigh for nor seek aught that is outside me . ''

		Always ready to hurl a courageous pamphlet in the teeth of Puritan and
Covenanter	PERSON	when a beloved Stuart needed defence ,
Drummond	PERSON	was nevertheless much happier as far as his personal interests were concerned , when he could write unmolested of the mystery of the universe or of the glories and sorrows of earthly love .

		In these days when it is still fashionable among students of English litera - ture to explain away all Petrarchan love affairs , there nevertheless arises no reason for doubting the story of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's youthful mistress and her untimely death .

		To be sure
Petrarch	PERSON	mourned the death of his Laura , and
Drummond	PERSON	's sonnets are often but para - phrases of French and Italian Petrarchans .

		But the critic who questions
Drummond	PERSON	's sin - cerity for such reasons is truly purblind from having looked too long at books and too little at life .

		Two lovely moods predominate in
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's best love poems , two moods so mutually sympathetic that they seem to blend readily in that golden monotone which I have already noted as characteristic of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though one of these moods is that of exalta - tion it is an exaltation which -LRB- I say it without fear of a phrase which contradicts itself -RRB- is so pensive and gentle that it has intimate kin - ship with the other mood , the melancholy of bereavement .

		Turn to one of his most beau - tiful lyrics of exaltation . ''

		Like the Idalian queen , Her hair about her eyne , With neck and breast 's ripe apples to be seen , At first glance of the morn , In
Cyprus	LOCATION	' gardens gathering those fair flow ` rs Which of her blood were born , I saw , but fainting saw , my paramours .

		The Graces naked danc 'd about the place , The winds and trees amaz 'd With silence on her gaz 'd ; The flow ` rs did smile , like those upon her face , And as their aspen stalks those fingers band , That she might read my case , A hyacinth I wish 'd me in her hand . ''

		Now this is exaltation but exaltation far removed from that of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's exaltation in the `` Epithalamion . ''

		It is exaltation , but an exaltation so gentle and timorous that it is half prophetic and we expect to pass with but the ghost of a modulation to the exquisite elegiac key that comes with the death of the beloved . ''

		My lute , be as thou wast when thou didst grow With thy green mother in some shady grove , When immelodious winds but made thee move , And birds on thee their ramage did bestow .

		Sith that dear voice which did thy sounds ap - prove , Which used in such harmonious strains to flow , Is reft from earth to tune those spheres above , What art thou but a harbinger of woe ?

		Thy pleasing notes be pleasing notes no more , But orphan wailings to the fainting ear ; Each stop a sigh , each sound draws forth a tear , Be , therefore , silent as in woods before ; Or , if that any hand to touch thee deign , Like widowed turtle still her loss complain . ''

		Now if the modern reader , used to consid - ering the thrust and sting of the modern love lyric as the only badge of sincerity , is troubled and dubious over the quaintly and conven - tionally cut jewels of Petrarchanism let him turn for a luminous commentary on this sober freshness for a proof of the sincerity of this golden monotone , to the reticent but strangely intimate words written by the poet to Sir
William Alexander	PERSON	four years after the loss of the beloved .

		`` And therefore , that now I live , that I enjoy a dear idleness , sweet solitariness , I have it of Him and not from Man .

		Trust in Him ; prefer not to certainties uncertain hopes .

		Conspiravit in dolores nostros haec aestas ; sola Dies potent tantum lenire dolorem , for we have what to plain and regret together and I what alone I must lament . ''

		But
Drummond	PERSON	's greatest mood , one which neither the memory of the breathing and warm body of his mistress nor the loyalty which always beat for
King James	ORGANIZATION	and
King Charles	ORGANIZATION	could keep long from the spirit that clung so close to the shadows and wayward lights of
Hawthornden	LOCATION	, was a favorite mood of those Elizabethan predecessors , his poetic brethren : the long pondering over `` this vapour , smoke , or spark called Life , '' the contemplation of mutability , the earnest scrutiny of the signs of a life hereafter .

		Like his Elizabethan kins - men who achieved with such a large practical sense , not like the more restricted orthodox , but like the equally pagan and Christian men , the Marlowes , the Spensers , the Raleighs , the Shakespeares ,
Drummond	PERSON	realized that medi - tation on eternal things , the destiny of man was of the first practical importance in the conduct of ordinary daily life .

		In our genera - tion , when most church-goers are irreligious be - cause of their lassitude -LRB- that deadly sin which the old ecclesiaste called sloth , accidia -RRB- and because in their lassitude they listen to pastors who talk languidly about `` practical
Chris	PERSON	- tianity '' -LRB- a phrase which really means positiv - ism or mere social morality without religion -RRB- , men may well go to
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	to learn that perspective which comes only from true reli - gious meditation and without which , as Drum - mond 's countryman
Carlyle	PERSON	warned us only a generation ago , no race can survive for long .

		One does not need to take the mythological lit - eralness of the following sonnet as gospel nor 200 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	even believe in anything like the concept at the heart of it to realize that it has a spa - ciousness of reflective power , the lack of which is one of our gravest and most paralyzing checks to progress , not only among the deso - late pews of a modern church but in the slums where we would grip the throat of Poverty and try to look steadily at his blue lips and leering eyes . ''

		If with such passing beauty , choice delights , The Architect of this great round did frame This palace visible , which World we name , Yet silly mansion but of mortal wights ; How many wonders , what amazing lights , Must that triumphing seat of glory claim Which doth transcend all this great All 's high heights , Of whose bright sun ours here is but a beam !

		blest abode !

		happy dwelling place !

		Wbere visibly th ' Invisible doth reign !

		Blest people , who do see true beauty 's face , With whose dark shadows He but earth doth deign , All joy is but annoy , all concord strife , Matched with your endless bliss and happy life . ''

		There is at once , I say , something suffocat - ing in this apparently orthodox primness and conventional imagery and something liberat - ing in its bold flight into the universe where we must all soar freely at times if we really hope to cleanse the terrible finiteness of our tenement districts .

		I am not urging that old doctrine which makes many modern reformers so impatient .

		I do not recommend the prayer of the reli - gious quietist who then goes about his own business and leaves God to do the social re - forming .

		I merely assert that a passionate contemplation of the universe is essential to practical reform .

		This we have forgotten and this we can learn again in the quiet and stead - fast glow of
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's poetry , or even more beautiful , I think , his noble prose threnody of mankind , `` The Cypress Grove , '' especially in the great skeptical or mournful passages that precede the calm faith of the close .

		Death , as it seems to many , '' Death is the sad estranger of acquaintance , the eternal divorcer of marriage , the ravisher of chil - dren from their parents , the stealer of parents from their children , the interrer of fame , the sole cause of forgetfulness , by which the living talk of those gone away as of so many shadows , or fabulous paladins ... The ruins of fanes , palaces , and other magnificent frames , yield a sad prospect to the soul , and how should it consider the wreck of such a wonderful masterpiece as is the body without horror ? ''

		The poet rises quickly from personal fear to a calm and spacious vision . ''

		This is the highway of mortality , our general home ; behold what millions have trod it before thee , what multitudes shall follow after thee , with them which at that same instant run !

		In so uni - versal a calamity , if Death be one , private com - plaints can not be heard ; with so many royal palaces , it is small loss to see thy poor cabin burn .

		... Thy death is a piece of the order of this All . ''

		Like an impetuous Elizabethan adventurer on seas and in majestic dreams ,
Drummond	PERSON	is almost eager for death that he may enrich his knowledge now so imperfect , that he may understand better man 's blind , audacious aspirations .

		For here on earth : '' Science , by the diverse notions of this globe of the brain of man , are become opinions , nay , errors , and leave the imagination in a thousand labyrinths .

		What is all we know compared with what we know not ?

		We have not yet agreed about the chief good and felicity . ''

		Yet even here one may become greater with a glimpse , at least , of Eternity for '' This Sun , that
Moon	PERSON	, these Stars , the varying dance of the
spring	DATE	,
summer	DATE	, autumn , winter is that very same which the Golden Age did see . ''

		Who would not be tempted to hasten to know more ?

		Whom the gods love die young .

		Wherein is the pathos ? ''

		Life is a journey on a dusty way ; the furthest rest is death .

		In this , some go more heavily bur - dened than others : swift and active pilgrims come to the end of it in the
morning	TIME	, or at noon which tortoise-paced wretches , clogged with the frag - mentary rubbidge of this world , scarce with great travel crawl unto at
midnight	TIME	. ''

		For can any seek substitute for a knowledge of eternity in that which we call on earth fame ? ''

		The huge
Egyptian Pyramids	ORGANIZATION	, and that grot in
Pausilipo	LOCATION	, though they have wrestled with
Time	ORGANIZATION	, and worn upon the vast of days , yet are their authors no more known than it is known by what strange earthquakes and deluges isles were divided from the continent , or hills bursted forth of the valleys . ''

		So our poet ponders until Neo-Platonism and Christianity , wedded with no conflict in his renaissance mind , teach him that he him - self is a master of the universe through his soul , `` an image of that unsearchable
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	in three essential powers , understanding , will , memory . ' '

		Nowadays our amorous poets do not dare to write sonnets in the form of catalogues vaunt - ing the superiority of their lady 's eyes over diamonds , the moon , the sun , lightning ; nor do they venture to sing of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	.

		These things would be considered insincere in our generation , or by many lifeless .

		Here , on the contrary , is the note that pierces the modern reader . ''

		I have forgot much ,
Cynara	PERSON	, gone with the wind , Flung roses , roses riotously with the throng , Dancing to put thy pale lost lillies out of mind . ''

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 201 Beside this how antiquated appear such lines as these of Drummond : '' As in a dusky and tempestuous night , A star is wont to spread her locks of gold , And , while her pleasant rays abroad are roll 'd , Some spiteful cloud doth rob us of her sight ; Fair soul , in this black age so shin 'd thou bright , And made all eyes with wonder thee behold , Till ugly Death , depriving us of light , In his grim misty arms thee did enfold . ''

		A hundred young men read
Dowson	PERSON	now while one reads
Drummond	PERSON	.

		Neither poet will , I think , be forgotten , though
Dowson	PERSON	's audience will shrink and he , too , will seem antiquated .

		Perhaps
Drummond	PERSON	's love poems will then seem greater because they minister so calmly yet tenderly to a mind diseased .

		And a generation more religious than ours will forgive the old poet his occasional theological creakiness as that generation will forgive his stiff hyperbole .

		For that generation will have no longer the morbid fear of '' other - worldli - ness ' ' which some of our ethical teachers would instil in us , but that generation will realize how through '' other - worldliness '' comes the perspective and firm grasp which alone can make us truly practical in our most earthly worldliness .

		* THE QUINTESSENCE or `` MODERNITY . ''

		* In the age of impressionism , criticism be - comes relentless in its betrayal of the critic .

		The expositor of the traits and features , the foibles and frailties , of the contemporary in art is the patent victim of his own analysis .

		If he is peculiarly susceptible to certain influ - ences in modern thinking , specific features of current emotionalism , nothing so readily ex - poses this susceptibility as his own thinking , his own emotionalism in the face of modern art-works .

		For being contemporary with the subjects of his consideration , he inevitably re - veals them on the side of his own sensitivity .

		These observations have pertinent applica - tion to the volume of Mr.
Samuel	PERSON	's studies , dealing with '' modernities '' so diverse as
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	and
Wedekind	PERSON	,
Heine	PERSON	and
Strindberg	LOCATION	,
Nietzsche	PERSON	and
Marie Corelli	PERSON	with
Disraeli	PERSON	,
Schnitzler	PERSON	,
Verhaeren	PERSON	,
Marinetti	PERSON	.

		The method of these `` studies '' or better , literary diver - sions is very simple .

		Throw in a paragraph of heavy brush-work generalization ; lighten up the perspective with a few biographical details to give an impression of background ; then sketch in a poster of the literary figure on the strength of a few dominant characteristics which seem to persist throughout his pub - * MODERNITIES .

Horace B. Samuel	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: B. P. lished works .

		The result is much the same in every case : the essay , springing up with all the flabbiness and rapidity of a fungus growth , reveals the subject not as an organic product of his environment and his period , but as a mushroom , an excrescence upon the surface of the age .

		The author is widely read in mod - ern literature ; his writing undulates with allusiveness .

		Yet his penchant for the flashy and the ephemerally clever , his predilection for the erotic and the sensual , give to `` mod - ernity '' a meaning at once evanescent and re - pellent .

		This book is clever , impertinent , sacrilegious , salacious a reminder of the work of the late
Percival Pollard	PERSON	, or of the German critic ,
Alfred Kerr	PERSON	.

		It would not be unfair , perhaps , to call this book a study , con amore , of modern eroticism were it not for the saving grace of the studies of
Nietzsche and Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	.

		The spir - itual struggle in all great contemporary think - ing , the growing sense of a responsibility transcending the scope of the individual , the recognition of the problematic nature of life in the sphere of moral relationship and the necessity for reconciliation between instinctive passion and self-control these one excludes from the category of the spirit here fatuously labelled `` modernity . ''

		The author modestly confesses , at the end of a long essay on Strind - berg : '' It is impossible casually to brush the man aside as some mere paranoiac . ''

		What a narrow escape for
Strindberg	LOCATION	!

		who , but for this confession of the author , might now be lost in the oblivion of Mr.
Samuel	PERSON	's condemna - tion as `` some mere paranoiac . ''

		The serious purpose , the ferocious forthrightness of
Wedekind	PERSON	escapes him utterly ; he can only revel in the riotous sensuality , the wild shame - lessness of
Wedekind	PERSON	's most plebeian pranks .

		Of the author of that marvellous poem of ' ' Fruhlings-Erwachen , ' ' the poignant tragedy of enforced sex-ignorance and betrayed inno - cence , he can only say in a paragraph of summation : '' It is for his fiendish delectation that he plies his knout on that world of abnor - malities called into existence for this express purpose , and writhing prettily in the mos ^ ingenious of dances . ''

		The purposive note of
Schnitzler	PERSON	the author of `` Liebelei '' eludes one who can recommend for perusal the unmentionable `` Reigen '' ; and upon the conclusion , the genuine tragic conclusion , of `` Liebelei '' we have this eloquent comment : `` Our fin de siecle

		Yet it is his tolerance for frailty , for infidelity , rather than the magic of his artistry , which wins the gen - erous approbation of his equally tolerant interpreter .

		The style of this book , while direct and for the most part expressive , is marred by the extravagance of its imagery , its adjectival superfluity , and the contortions of its pseudo - cleverness . ' '

		The bitten mind barks savagely back at its own mad image '' is inspired by
Verhaeren	PERSON	's line : '' Les chiens du noir espoir ont aboye ce soir . ''

		Stirred by the cycle of
Signor Marinetti	PERSON	's `` Le Demon de la Vitesse , '' he thus gets under way : ' ' For now the poet , stoking the engines of his pounding brain with the monstrous coals of his own energy , drives his train of J ^ schy - lean images -LRB- well equipped with all the latest modern inventions -RRB- with all the record-break - ing rapidity of some trans - American express , from the ` vermilion terraces of love , ' across ` Hindu evenings , ' ` tyrannical rivers , ' ` aveng - ing forests , ' ` milleniar torrents , ' and ` the dusky corpulence of mountains , ' to traverse ' the delirium of Space ' and ' the supreme pla - teaux of an absurd Ideal , ' to end finally in the grinding shock of a collision and all the agony of a shipwrecked vessel .

		CLASSIC ARCHITECTURE IN National prominence and rapid artistic de - velopment are found concurrently in so many periods of history that it is wise at least to look for a blossoming of art wherever there has been notable success in other fields , like the political and economic .

		Hellas and
Rome	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	and
Venice	LOCATION	are the usual supports of such a view ;
Spain	LOCATION	after
1492	DATE	,
France	LOCATION	in the
Grand Siecle	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	in the last gen - eration tempt comparison .

		Not all of the arts necessarily , nor always a special one of them , have thus responded to contemporary circum - stances , but now sculpture , now architecture , now painting , now several arts at once .

		It is rare , indeed , if not unexampled , that a notable expansion in other fields has long failed to be accompanied by an escape from provincialism in the field of art .

		For English art during the period of British predominance fewer claims have been made * MONUMENTAL CLASSIC ARCHITECTURE IN GREAT

		than the importance of the nation in politics , science , and literature might have suggested .

		The inherited lack of sympathy with actual participation in creative arts , the mutual de - crying of rival native schools , have prevented a full appreciation of the degree to which , half - unconsciously ,
England	LOCATION	did develop a great art of her own , contemporary with the found - ing of British empire , and not unworthy of it in influence .

		The establishment of British imperial su - premacy , prepared by victories over the Spanish and the Dutch , was effected in the eighteenth century by the wars with
France	LOCATION	, culminating in
1759	DATE	at
Plassey	LOCATION	and
Quebec	LOCATION	.

		Wherever a final limit may yet be drawn , the century following may be taken as that of un - doubted and self-confident mastery .

		In other activities as well as in the political , it was dur - ing this general period that
England	LOCATION	played her most important role .

		The distinguished con - tributions of
England	LOCATION	to philosophy and to science , through
Newton	LOCATION	,
Locke	PERSON	, and
Berkeley	LOCATION	, were made coincident with the first expansion toward empire ; the scholarship of
Bentley	LOCATION	and
Gibbon	PERSON	, the epochal creation of the first novel - ists , fall in the middle eighteenth century .

		The empire was primarily the work of an aristocracy , which determined the direction of art until well into the nineteenth century , until the rising popular forces of industrialism and humanitarianism cost both aristocracy and classic art their supremacy .

		Its characteristic arts were those which ministered to luxury and family pride architecture and garden - ing , furniture and plate , in painting , portrai - ture .

		In some of these , we at once recognize , British art showed creative power of a high order .

		The furniture of the Adams antici - pated that of
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		and the Empire ; the landscape garden , the jardin anglais , swept the continent like wild-fire .

		It is less appre - ciated that in architecture , also ,
England	LOCATION	was first in developing a style destined to victory on the continent .

		The furious attacks of Rus - kin have blinded two generations against see - ing that in its classical architecture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
England	LOCATION	has a great and a national art .

		The rehabilitation of the classical revival as a movement historically conditioned and thor - oughly vital in its day has been a work of the
last few years	DATE	it is still far from complete .

		Only in
Germany	LOCATION	is it understood that art can - not have died in
1800	DATE	, or at any other date ; in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	we have at most tim - idly moved the end forward a decade or two .

		It is refreshing therefore to see a book like Mr.
Richardson	PERSON	's ' ' Monumental Classic Archi - tecture in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	during
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 203 the Eighteenth and
Nineteenth Centuries	ORGANIZATION	, '' which proceeds from the conviction that his subject-matter is one worthy of adequate pre - sentation and detailed study .

		In his handsome folio we have the first assemblage of large scale photographs and measured drawings of modern classic buildings in
England	LOCATION	.

		The selection is good , the presentation excellent .

		The purpose of the text is really hortatory , though it is cast in an historical form not the best adapted to such a purpose .

		The author wishes to urge the desirability of a return to monumental classic architecture in important buildings of the present .

		Under the historical method of presentation the buildings have mostly to speak for themselves , and very mon - umental and satisfying some of them are .

		Though unstarred in
Baedeker	LOCATION	, such superb compositions as the
Lothbury Angle	ORGANIZATION	and the
Lothbury Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	, such exquisite detail as in the organ loft at
Green	ORGANIZATION	- wich
Hospital	ORGANIZATION	, are worthy the attention of lay - men as well as of architects .

		What they teach in fact , however , is not that attempts in similar vein would be successful in the future , but that in the
England	LOCATION	of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries the classical move - ment was deeply rooted and produced magnifi - cent fruits .

		The eighteenth century saw a second dis - covery of antiquity so much surpassing the first in exactness of knowledge as to require a new purification of an architecture which ac - cepted without question the authority of the ancients .

		With all allowances for the work of other nations , the English must be accorded first place not only in the importance of their early studies in
Greece	LOCATION	, but in being the first to make application of the newly discovered forms in works of large scale .

		While
France	LOCATION	was deciding that there was no place for the literal reproduction of Greek forms in a mod - ern architecture ,
Stuart	PERSON	and Revett were beget - ting a generation to whom classic forms were truly their own .

		Whether a new classical re - vival in architecture can succeed to-day with - out the cultural foundations of the earlier ones , is the question now being argued pro and con by deeds on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		RECENT FICTION .

		* After all , a novelist needs more than any - thing else a knowledge of people .

		If he really has this knowledge even a little skill will enable him to go a long way toward appeasing that insatiable curiosity about what is going on in other people 's minds which intrigues us all .

		A novelist must have feeling , else he will arouse none in his readers .

		But was there ever a novelist of insight into human conduct who did not have feeling ?

		The power to see and the capacity to react to the thing seen are so bound up together that it is difficult to imag - ine either existing by itself .

		The novelist without feeling is an anomaly .

		When he exists it is because novel-writing is a profes - sion as well as an art .

		He is a novelist for the same reason that he might have been a princi - pal of a high-school or an expert accountant .

		But the true novelist , even if he is a poor novelist , writes because his perception of the human scene is too keen to be contained within himself .

		He must share with others his con - viction , in Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's phrase , of ' ' the interestingness of life . ' '

		This perception and this conviction are one .

		It is out of knowledge about life that feeling about life is born .

		But there are many kinds and degrees of knowledge about life , even of knowledge of human beings ; and some kinds -LRB- as well as , some degrees -RRB- are more interesting than others .

		The general rule is that knowledge of people is interesting in proportion as it is in - timate , personal , and concrete , and uninter - esting in proportion as it is detached , general , and abstract .

		Which is to say that a
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	can never compete with a
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		The
Baroness von Suttner	PERSON	was a woman who saw clearly and felt deeply what war meant in the large .

		If she had seen it as clearly and felt it as deeply in the small , she might have written some of those pages in which
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	gave us war .

		But her concern was not with the emotions of the individual ; it was rather with the progress of the race .

		That is why this carefully written idealistic ' ' romance of the immediate future , '' which is called `` When Thoughts Will Soar '' in Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's translation , contains so little that will inevi - tably engage the reader of fiction .

Sept. 16	DATE	novel , like her earlier ones , is bound to gain our respect ; but as her vision is too far from the immediate present , so her story is too far from immediate reality to capture our inter - est spontaneously .

		Her heroine , a feminist of the sort to whom an anti-feminist would be the last to object so impossible is it to find a flaw in her is only a device by which to point the way toward universal peace .

		She does not touch us .

		Mr.
Opie Read	PERSON	, whose reputation as a teller of stories is wider than any he has ever made as a novelist , knows more about men and women than he chooses to tell us in '' The New Mr.
Howerson	PERSON	. ''

		His theme the regenera - tion of a man is one that has tempted most writers , and tempted them to vanity .

		Men are regenerated ; and there is perhaps no proc - ess about which we are more curious .

		But Mr.
Bead	PERSON	is an incorrigible rhetorician , a man who can no more keep the flowers out of his speech than the humor out of his eye .

		He is at the mercy of his old habits , and so we read sentences like this : '' Then he bought a watch , wondering as to who was now wearing a ticker of life 's seconds once the timekeeper of his father 's sermons , a proud possession , but long since entrusted to a stranger over whose door hung a bunch of enormous grapes , but only three in number . ''

		That is not a typical example , but it is per - haps an average one .

		There is a kindly wit on many a page , a wit that does not appear in the sentence quoted ; and there is ineptitude also .

		Neither is a substitute for the facts , the solid human stuff which is the essential mate - rial of novels .

		An old nickname for
Butte	ORGANIZATION	,
Montana	LOCATION	, fur - nishes the title for Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	's new novel , `` Perch of the Devil . ''

		The hero digs millions out of a mine ; the heroine absorbs culture from a schoolteacher ; the result is a happy adjustment of their warring natures .

		But be - fore Ida learned to wear her clothes one does not wear clothes passably : one wears them well or ill
Gregory	PERSON	fell in love with Ora , who had been born to these things .

		Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	manages to convey an adequate notion of how Ida contrived to acquire the manners of the upper middle class they are not such elaborate manners that they can not be acquired after maturity !

		But the triangle is not so simple .

		Like a hundred other nov - elists , Mrs.
Atherton	PERSON	has failed to do the im - possible .

		She has tried to make us believe that
Gregory	PERSON	's love for Ora was a supreme passion , and that he was happy in giving it up .

		Her attempt is hardly to be respected , however re - spectable it may be .

		Mrs.
Ghosal	PERSON	is a sister of Mr.
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	.

		And though she has not his genius , she has some of his qualities .

		She knows what she has to tell , and she tells it with a simplic - ity and directness almost childlike .

		The story is a Hindu girl 's account of her love , first for a man who proved untrustworthy , and then for another who proved worthy .

		She thought it a hopeless love because her father had already arranged a marriage for her in the Hindu fashion .

		Happily the man she loves and the man she is to marry prove to be the same person .

		The flavor of the narrative may be found in this passage , on the last page but one : '' I thought at one time that individuality dis - appeared in love , and that love was all self-abne - gation , but now I find that as light and shade are both required for a landscape , so altercations and demands are also adjuncts of love , and in this way love is kept ever young .

		`` At any rate in our lives love is full of chal - lenge . '

		You do not love me , ' I say mockingly , ` you love the companion of your childhood . ' ''

		` You do not love me , ' is the inevitable reply . '

		You love the man you met at your sister 's house , the doctor . '

		`` And now I leave to the judgment of the reader to decide whom I have loved .

		Did I love the com - panion of my childhood and perceive the reflection of him in the doctor whom I met again as a man and a stranger , or did I love the man , and obtain the companion of my childhood by accident ? ''

		Dartmoor , which is generally regarded as a specialty of Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	's , has for long been the chosen scene of another novelist , Mr.
John Trevena	PERSON	.

		`` Granite '' is at least the sixth of his stories of this country .

		Mr.
Tre	PERSON	- vena is what is called a stylist , but his novels are not dependent on their `` literary '' qual - ity .

		He is full of the lore of peasants .

		He knows their speech , their customs , and their bitter humor .

		But of course he is not himself a peasant , and like other men who write of a people among whom they do not properly be - long , he has always a tendency to make melo - drama of what he has seen but not truly lived .

		It would seem simple enough for a man who has lived alone in a cabin on Dartmoor for years to put the people he has known before us without the touch of false strangeness .

		But it is not .

		Mr.
Trevena	PERSON	has tried , and tried as the artist must , but he has not altogether suc - ceeded .

		What he has accomplished is a piece of work that , were it about
Brown County	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, instead of Dartmoor ,
England	LOCATION	, would be bound to interest many American readers .

		The first chapters of `` The Lay Anthony '' are surprisingly good .

		Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	has evidently taken great pains to select the pre - cise details which would suggest his young hero and the American town in which he lives .

		I thought as I read these pages that I had dis -
1914	DATE	-RSB- 205 covered a writer who knew American life and had both the courage and the skill to record it .

		But Mr.
Hergesheimer	PERSON	is bound to move his readers at any cost .

		He is not satisfied with the stuff he has in his head ; he must dress it up with the stuff that he has found in yellow newspapers and in the speeches of romantic social workers .

		`` The Lay Anthony '' ends with one of the situations made so familiar by the `` white slave '' literature of the past two or three years .

		It is a pity , because Mr.
Her	PERSON	- gesheimer undoubtedly knows a number of things that his readers would have been glad to learn , in place of this clap-trap .

GARY	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		characteristics sir
Willoughby Maycock	PERSON	had his of
Joseph	PERSON	book , ' ' With Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	in the
United States	LOCATION	, 1887-88 , '' all written and on the point of publication , when an unexpected and melancholy timeliness was given to it by the sudden death of the man whom he had so admiringly portrayed and whose name was to have appeared in a dedica - tion of the work .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	had `` evinced great interest '' in the book 's prep - aration , and presumably its details , so far as they touch on his personal history and public services , are of that degree of accuracy which he himself would have desired .

		The author was assistant secretary to the special mission appointed by
Great Britain	LOCATION	in
1887	DATE	to confer with representatives of this country on the subject of the fisheries question , which had become a rather vexatious matter of dispute since the expiration in
1885	DATE	of the treaty defining the rights of each of the interested parties .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	was senior member of the British mission , and as such was re - ceived in this country with appropriate honors .

		It was his first visit , and one of its results , of the greatest interest to him , was the winning of an American wife in the person of Miss
Mary E. Endicott	PERSON	, daughter of our then Secretary of `` War .

		It will be readily conjectured that the visit as a whole , from
November , 1887	DATE	, to
February , 1888	DATE	, was suffi - ciently full of society events and travel inci - dents , including a brief sojourn in
Canada	LOCATION	, to furnish a readable volume of some size from the assistant secretary 's pen .

		His nar - rative is considerably extended with press clippings pertinent to the matters in hand , and there are many illustrations , among which should be noted the author 's own amateur efforts at pen-and-ink drawing , which give a welcome and amusing variety to the work .

		Not lacking , too , are the occasional betrayals of unfamiliarity with things American which we expect in a foreigner 's account of his ex - periences in this country .

		But they are few .

		He calls one of our foremost educational insti - tutions `` Princetown University , '' and his brief biographical sketch of
James B. Angell	PERSON	, who served as one of the three
United States	LOCATION	representatives in the conference already re - ferred to , contains no mention of the
Michigan University	ORGANIZATION	presidency so long held by Dr.
Angell	PERSON	, though it does speak of his professor - ship at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	and his mission to
China	LOCATION	.

		Among the qualities noted in the character of the ' ' chief , ' ' as Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	is occasionally called , the following is of in - terest : `` He never lost an opportunity of devouring current literature , which interested him far more than conversation with dull people .

		I have never met anyone who could master the contents of a book so rapidly as Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		I remember his reading `
Ben Hur	PERSON	, ' which appeared about that time and was much talked of , in about a couple of hours , and I do n't believe he skipped a line . ''

		The full text of the fisheries treaty , signed at
Washington	LOCATION	by the several commissioners
February 15 , 1888	DATE	, is reproduced , with enough related matter to satisfy readers interested in the historical and diplomatic phase of the famous English statesman 's first visit to our shores .

		The author has certainly allowed sufficient time to pass since then to enable him to give the event its proper perspective .

Chatto & Windus	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		The classic account of the won - derful awakening of
Portugal	LOCATION	in the fifteenth century is the his - tory of that period by the late
J. P. Oliveira Martins	PERSON	entitled `` Os Filhos de D. Joao I. '' -LRB- The Sons of John L -RRB- .

		This great study has recently appeared in an English translation , the joint product of
James Johnston Abrams	PERSON	and
William E. Reynolds	PERSON	.

		In order to give the work a title that has a definite meaning to English and American readers , the trans - lators have called it `` The Golden Age of Prince Henry the Navigator '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		It is not to be inferred , however , that
Prince Henry	ORGANIZATION	is the hero or even the leading character of the work :
John I.	PERSON	had six sons , all of whom had important parts to play in Portuguese history , and the author traces the careers of all .

		If he finds a hero among them it is Peter the Trav - eller , for whose philosophic patience and gov - ernmental ideas the learned author shows much admiration .

		His picture of the great Prince
Henry	PERSON	is decidedly unsympathetic : he describes him as a hard-hearted fanatic , ob - sessed with ideas of exploration and conquest 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	which finally led to the ruin of the father - land .

		It is
Martins	PERSON	's opinion that , although the Portuguese discoveries along the African coast and in the
East Indies	LOCATION	were of great value to
Europe	LOCATION	and to civilization , their benefit to
Portugal	LOCATION	was merely temporary .

		For imperial expansion and colonization Por - tugal , the author believes , had neither the necessary population nor the requisite mate - rial resources .

		As a result of the new ambi - tions the national strength was dissipated and a promising future failed .

		Prince
Henry	PERSON	is also held responsible for the introduction of negro slavery into
Portugal	LOCATION	and the conse - quent introduction of Ethiopian blood into the Portuguese race .

		The author shows a strong bias against the aristocratic element in
Portu	LOCATION	- guese life and government , due , no doubt , to his political sympathies , which are those of a modern republican .


Martins	PERSON	's history posses - ses a rare interest ; it has great literary excel - lences , and the translation appears to have been prepared with much care .

		There seems to be no good reason , however , for retaining the Portuguese forms of proper names in a work that has such a positive popular appeal , especially since practically all such names have recognized English equivalents .

		Twelve at - tractive illustrations , chiefly pictures of his - toric places , add greatly to the value of the work .

		Uncalled-for attacks on
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lord
Alfred Douglas	PERSON	rakes over an unsavory affair in his ' ' Oscar Wilde and Myself '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- .

		His excuses for doing so are both pitiably and laughably inadequate .

		In the first place , he is on bad terms with some of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's other friends and biographers who have accused him of exerting an evil influence over
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	and spending
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's substance in riotous liv - ing , and have hinted at graver charges .

		In the second place , and this is his main motive , he wishes to forestall the damage that may be done to his fair fame by the possible publica - tion of large unprinted portions of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's `` De Profundis '' in the year
1960	DATE	!

		The manu - script is now deposited in the British Museum with the understanding that it is not to be published before that year ; but certain parts of it were read in court in connection with a libel suit .

		Even if in
1960	DATE	the world is inter - ested in
Oscar Wilde	LOCATION	, the idea that in that year of grace anybody will be interested in Lord
Alfred Douglas	PERSON	is sufficiently grotesque .

		But the futility of his present performance is heightened by the fact that he has been for - bidden by an injunction to quote the attacks which it is his chief purpose to answer .

		His book is the angry outcry of a man who feels abused .

		Of course it is unfair to
Wilde	LOCATION	; it probably errs almost as much on the side of depreciation as the biographies have erred on the side of praise . ''

		It is always Judas , ' ' said
Wilde	PERSON	, `` who is the biographer '' ; but Judas may have something significant to say .

		In this case he has not very much .

		It is of no great interest to know that Lord
Alfred Doug	PERSON	- las paid
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's bills ; or that
Wilde	PERSON	`` was the biggest eater I ever knew '' ; or that in his last days he lost his `` fine head for liquor . ''

		`` He would rise from his seat and say , ` My dear fellow , I am sorry , but I per - ceive that I am drunk . ' '

		These biographical details , however , are more interesting than Lord
Alfred	PERSON	's attacks on
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's literary rep - utation .

		As to the second part of the title , Lord
Alfred	PERSON	's portrait of himself is not en - gaging .

		Even if we accept all that he says in his own defence , he remains a pretty thorough - going snob , and a good deal of a cad . ' '

		One can not , '' as he remarks , `` be the son of the eighth
Marquis	PERSON	of Queensberry nor a member of the family of
Douglas	PERSON	without having the defects of one 's qualities . ''

		It is a pity that one of these defects should be a desire to pub - lish the others .

		The exacts Unless a man has a compelling profession of love for the forester 's life and the forester 's work , let him give the profession a wide berth , is Mr.
Gifford Pinchot	PERSON	's opening word of advice to readers of his succinct and excellent handbook , `` The Training of a Forester '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Indis - putable is his assertion that `` to the man whom it really suits , forestry offers a career more attractive , it may be said in all fairness , than any other career whatsoever '' ; but he states the fact as if it were not equally true of all , callings , from the clergyman 's to the hang - man 's .

		To Mr.
Pinchot	PERSON	himself , as his book abundantly proves , the work of the Forester -LRB- invariably with a capital F -RRB- is the one work preeminently worth doing in the world , and it is the author 's enthusiasm , backed by his thorough knowledge of his subject , that gives to his pages their readability and persuasive - ness .

		In sixteen brief chapters or sections he treats of the forest itself , the forest and the nation , the forester 's professional equipment , his point of view , the personal qualities he should possess , the various branches of his work , national and state and private forestry , forestry schools , the forester 's opportunity , and kindred subjects .

		Emphasis is laid on the necessity that the would-be successful for - ester have persistence and enthusiasm , the will to keep everlastingly at it , and the vision to realize the meaning and value of the results he is striving to attain .

		The obvious applica - bility of this principle to every worthy calling
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 207 in the range of human activity does not diminish its pertinency in the present instance .

		Young men with any inclination for the pro- fession so worthily represented by Mr.
Pinchot	PERSON	should not fail to read his book .

		Eight illus - trations from photographs help to impart its lesson and enhance its attractiveness .

		Aeha terin ^ F > ^ '' '
Wellington	LOCATION	's mono - ow-pubUc tn graph , `` The Political and
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- land history .

		ti -LRB- mal I n fl uence O f t fc e Public Lands , 1828-1842 '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , constitutes a valuable addition to the literature of the pub - lic domain .

		While the intensive part of the book begins with the passage of the tariff of
1828	DATE	, a preliminary chapter gives a review of the period since
1820	DATE	, so that the work con - nects with Professor Treat 's volume upon ' ' The National Land System , 1785-1820 . ' '

		In the body of his little book , Professor Welling - ton gives a minute analysis of the general legislation with regard to the public lands enacted or proposed in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and shows the relation of the votes of parties upon this subject to the votes upon the tariff and inter - nal improvements , and to those upon the gen - eral financial policy of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		With truly commendable industry , Professor
Wellington	LOCATION	has traced the history of the many important land bills in their weary parliamen - tary course , and has carefully analyzed the votes by congressional districts and states .

		Through the latter study , he is able to present the sectional relation of the public land ques - tion , and to show how the East and the South tried to bargain with the West in regard to land measures , and how the presidential aspi - rants of the time were influenced by these sectional currents .

		The scope of the book is limited almost exclusively to these political bearings of the public land question .

		There is no attempt to discuss the deeper importance of the public lands , and little is said about the actual working of the land system in the states and territories ; but what Professor Welling - ton undertook to do , he has accomplished with success .

		The title `` Shakespeare 's Coun - ftiner ~ arT earean try '' in the `` Highways and By - ways '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- be - comes very elastic , as treated by the Ven .


W. H. Hutton	PERSON	.

		Of the four hundred and forty closely printed pages of the book , only about one-half have to do with the neigh - borhood of
Stratford	LOCATION	and
Warwickshire	ORGANIZATION	in general .

		In the remainder , we are taken to regions somewhat afield regions of anti- quarian rather than literary interest .

		This will be regarded as a merit or a blemish , according to the taste of the individual reader .

		The author claims a forty years ' acquaintance with the country ; the `` pleas - ant task '' of writing the book was begun four years ago .

		But , sometimes a weight of knowledge may become a handicap to a writer ; he finds it so hard to get far enough away from his authorities that his style and manner drag .

		The book is less readable than one would expect considering the special lit - erary and intrinsic picturesqueness of these regions ; nevertheless , it may well be given a place on the reference shelf , or in the travel library of those specially interested in minute , antiquarian lore .

		The volume is copiously and beautifully illustrated by the drawings of Mr.
Edmund H. New	PERSON	; a map at the end ena - bles the reader to follow with exactness the author 's itinerary .

		We noted a year or two ago the Correspondence i n. of an American appearance ot the first volume of the Letters of
Richard Henry Lee	PERSON	, edited by Dr.
James Curtis Ballagh	PERSON	, of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, and published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the auspices of the Society of the
Colonial Dames of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is now completed by a second vol - ume , of nearly six hundred pages , with a full index to the entire collection .

		As with most of the letter writers among our Revolutionary fathers , these pages make their appeal to the casual reader as well as to the seeker after the facts of history .

		The present volume covers fifteen years , from
1779	DATE	to
1794	DATE	, the last letter bearing a date only three months pre - vious to Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's death .

		Under present cir - cumstances we are glad to quote the following paragraph from this closing letter , directed to President
Washington	LOCATION	: '' The success and happiness of the
United States	LOCATION	is our care , and if the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	approve war , we surely may be permitted to cultivate the arts of peace .

		And it is really a happiness to reflect that if war should befall us , our government will not promote it ; but give cause to all who venerate humanity to revere the Rulers here . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Four new volumes in Mr.
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	's series of '' New Guides to Old Masters '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are at hand .

		These are , respectively : ''
Munich	LOCATION	,
Frankfort	LOCATION	and
Cassel	PERSON	, '' grouped in one volume , ''
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Dresden	LOCATION	'' in another , ''
Vienna	LOCATION	and
Budapest	LOCATION	'' in another , and ``
Madrid	LOCATION	'' by itself .

		An interesting feature of these volumes , as of their predecessors , is that however much traditional attributions may be questioned , the assthetic value of each canvas is never ignored .

		`` Venetian painting , quite good enough for
Giorgione	ORGANIZATION	, and in spite of one 's doubts , possibly by him . ''

		This kind of expo - 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	sition is precisely what the intelligent tourist needs a critical discussion of the work before which he stands , comparing it with other works by the same artist .


Pierre Loti	PERSON	's memorable impressionistic work on the land of the Pharaohs appears in a new printing from the house of
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which first sent it forth to American readers early in
1910	DATE	.

		Its English title , ''
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' is far more appropriate than the French name -LRB- `` La Mort de Philse '' -RRB- under which it appeared in the author 's own coun - try .

		Mr.
W. P. Baines	PERSON	is the competent translator , and Mr.
A. Lamplough	PERSON	has supplied '' eight illus - trations in colour '' according to the announce - ment on the title-page ; but the most diligent search fails to discover a single one of these art - products in the copy at hand .

		The propriety of the French title appears only in the closing chapter , on '' The Passing of Philae . ''

		Leonardo da
Vinci	PERSON	's anatomical papers -LRB- '' Qua - derni d'Anatomia '' -RRB- in the Royal Library at
Windsor	LOCATION	have since
1911	DATE	been appearing in annual volumes under the editorship of three members of
the University of Christiania	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Ove C. L. Vangen	PERSON	- stein ,
M.A.	LOCATION	,
A. Fonahn	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	, and
H. Hopstock	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	-RRB- and with the publisher 's imprint of
Jacob Dybwad	PERSON	,
Christiania	LOCATION	.

		Collotype reproductions of drawings and text , with English and German translations of the latter , render the work as nearly satisfactory in its completeness as it could well be made .

		The remaining volumes will appear , one at a time , in
September	DATE	of each year , until the under - taking is completed in six volumes . ''

		Librarians , teachers of medical history , bibliophiles , artists , and those generally interested , '' are advised by the publisher to send in early orders for this work , which , as soon as two-thirds of the edition is sold , will be obtainable only at an advanced price , and which , the publisher predicts , will in a few years ' time be rare if not unobtainable .

		The publication of the `` Journal of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Burgesses of
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' by the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	, is continued under the editorial super - vision of State Librarian
H. R. Mcllwaine	PERSON	, with a volume containing records of the Assembly from
1695	DATE	to
1702	DATE	, a period of great importance in European and American history .

		The originals of these Journals are not known to be in existence and this publication is from transcripts made of copies in the
English Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		As in former volumes , the editorial work is very carefully done .

		There is a good index by names and subjects and the membership roll of each session is carefully made up .

		During the years covered by this volume
William III	PERSON	.

		of
England	LOCATION	was in the midst of his European wars , fighting as a champion of Prot - estantism .

		The conflict spread to
America	LOCATION	and resulted in the first general intercolonial war between the French and English colonists .

		The Proceedings of the
Virginia	LOCATION	burgesses reflect the activities of the time .

		There is much about the militia , the Indians , the navigation acts , salaries , taxes , and intercolonial matters .

		Like the former volumes , this one is valuable because it shows the development of an Anglo-American community from its beginnings .

		Mr.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 209 ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .

		It has been the custom of THE DIAL for many years past to place before its readers at this time a complete classified list of books announced for issue during the fall and winter season by the principal American publishers .

		These lists , carefully compiled for our pages from authentic information obtained especially for this purpose , have come to be accepted as a feature of the utmost interest and value to librarians , booksellers , and private book - buyers .

		The list for the present year , here - with presented , contains nearly two thousand titles , representing the output of about sixty publishers .

		Considerations of space make nec - essary the carrying over to our next issue of two departments ' ' School and College Text - Books ' ' and ' ' Books for the Young . ' '

		Some of the more interesting features among these announcements are commented upon in the leading editorial in this issue of THE DIAL .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 231 -LRB- From a Review in the ' Minneapolis Journal '' -RRB- Lincoln as He Was The
Everyday Life of Abraham Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Francis F. Browne	PERSON	.


Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Publishers	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		THE material for this work , which was originally published
thirty years ago	DATE	, was collected from more than five hundred of the friends and contemporaries of
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		So much has been written on the subject during the last generation that any new issue in the field owes an apology for its existence .

		The manner in which the present volume was prepared constitutes a more than sufficient apology .

		Here an attempt has been made to present Lincoln , the man , rather than
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the tradition ; and the result might be characterized as an anecdotal life . ''

		It can not be doubted that the traditional Lincoln , as usually presented to school children , and which has become fixed in the mind of the average adult , is a rather highly sentimentalized concept .

		All the tremendous and tragic circum - stances surrounding the man were admirably suited to act as a distorting medium .

		A long and exhausting war is conducive to popular hysteria , as a result of which even the most level-headed men are likely to overstate ; and the tragic death would tend to stifle the colder , more detached criticism .

		Added to these circumstances was the powerful appeal to humanitarian idealism involved in the emancipation of slaves . ''

		In the greater number of writings on Lincoln , one can not but note an almost total lack of the sober critical faculty .

		All witnesses seem to have vied with each other in exaltation .

		Nearly all testimony has a suspicious note of emotional abandon in it .

		It will probably never be possible entirely to separate the tradi - tional from the factual ; but that critical-minded historian of the future who shall write the fairest possible appraisal of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's character shall be obliged to make use of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's volume ; and therein lies its chief value as a source .

		Nor need any American patriot fear the result of that colder criticism which is inevitable .

		The present volume , in which
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is much less of a sad demi-god than in the conventional representations , shows how much greater a man may be in fact than in sentimental tradition . ''

		Here is shown plainly , what has never been a secret and yet is persistently ignored , that
Lincoln	PERSON	held out as long as possible against those who urged the abolition of slavery , issuing his proclamation only as a last desperate means of subduing the South .

		It was the master-stroke of a wise opportunist rather than the exalted deed of a humanitarian .

		And yet millions of children have been led to believe that the war was primarily a war against the institution of slavery , and that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's chief concern was with the freeing of slaves .

		Truly , he was opposed to slavery , but he constantly placed the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	above abolition , believing that the latter should be accomplished by a slow process of purchase and colonization .

		That he thus proved his far-sightedness is apparent now when the negro question has become an issue of grave importance .

		There is much in the evidence here presented to indicate that , had he lived through the Eeconstruction period , the negro would have been dealt with in a much more prac - tical way than that of the high-handed ultra-humanitarians who insisted upon regarding the negro as an Anglo-Saxon with a black skin . ''

		Furthermore , we here see Lincoln as a possible human being , '' capable of losing patience , capable of petulance and anger , capable of making mistakes .

		And inasmuch as he is made to appear more the man and less the demi-god , by so much he looms the bigger and is the more intelligible to men . ''

GEORGE W. JACOBS & CO.	ORGANIZATION	, PUBLISHERS ,
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	Songs of Nature and Life '' ONE OF THE MOST SATISFYING OF RECENT COLLECTIONS OF VERSE ' CPRINGFIELD REPUBLICAN : '' The Golden Books are mostly old .

		Let us now and then acknowledge the gold minted in our own day . ''

		... ' `` Poems of Human Prog - ress , ' besides being one of the largest , is one of the most satisfy - ing of recent collections of verse .

		There is a Wordsworthian purity of diction and love of Nature abounding in the many poems , especially the sonnets , that makes them delightful .

		One browses on from poem to poem full of optimistic cheer and lofty idealism , coming constantly on striking lines and a genuine depth of thought and feeling .

		There is not a poem in the book that is a mere experiment in metre or a group of felic - itously composed phrases ; beneath each piece of verse lies a definite thought .

		MT. West rises to his highest in his sonnets , of which there are more than 100 .

		The virile love of Nature that permeates them distinctively turns the reader 's thoughts to
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		In quoting from them one is perplexed at the abundance of good things , but the following must suffice as fair examples : -LSB- two sonnets are here quoted entire , `` In Suburban Woods '' and `` By Dark or Light -RSB- .

		The poems are marked throughout by an intensely human appeal , a discerning appreciation of the power of things simple and unaffected to develop the spirituality of humanity .

		A depressed and har - assed man could scarce find better reading to smooth the wrinkles out of his soul and give him a more roseate view of life . ''

		TJOOK NEWS MONTHLY -LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` There is a surprise and a delight in store for him who looks into ` Poems of Human Progress , ' for therein is included much that is very real poetry indeed .

		Polished in style and powerful in substance , the poems make peculiar appeal to all that is aspirational in man .

		Mr.
West	PERSON	's claim to attention is largely upon what
Emerson	PERSON	has termed ` Man thinking ' ; yet it would be unfair to say that there are not also poems of purely lyric charm .

		` Man 's Triumph-Era ' is a prophetic vision possessed of unusual merit .

		` The Epic of Man ' is a somewhat shorter poem with power to move the reader strongly .

		` Heart of ` THE PUBLIC -LRB-
Chicago	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` Scholarship with simple-heart - A edness , love of Nature serving love of man these are qualifications for a true democratic poet .

		A vision for man , seen with Nature-loving eyes , is embodied in ` Courage , O Workers ! '

		Beautiful and expre ` ssive lines are to be found everywhere through these pages .

		When such ease and strength of diction are combined with such accuracy of observation , such love of mankind , and such a sense of future good , the result is a poet who is worth while . ''

		PHRISTIAN REGISTER -LRB-
Boston	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` P9r high purpose , clear message , and poetic workmanship , should find accepted place among the best work of our American poets .

		... In his sonnets Mr.
West	PERSON	has attained , at highest , a point not topped by any other of our accredited American poets , and here he may safely invite comparison with much of the best work of
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		The strongest and finest of his songs give him claim to very wide admiration .

		His verse displays a pleasing and effective variety of form notably excellent .

		Fine quotable lines are so frequent as to tempt to unrestrained extracts .

		More than one sonnet might fairly be called a chain of linked epigrams .

		The dominant note is an insistent ' forward ' call , an appeal for the simple , the natural , the human .

		The thought reflects cheerfulness , geniality , wealths of beauty , humane enthusiasm ; bits of portraiture sometimes rugged , sometimes tender , always wonderfully sympathetic and vivid . ''

GREENWICH VILLAGE	LOCATION	.


Greenwich Village	LOCATION	is the American parallel of the
Latin Quarter	LOCATION	.

		As everybody is sup - posed to know ,
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	had once a separate existence of its own , outside the town of
New York	LOCATION	; and its boundaries , when pointed out , are even now precise .

		One who lives on the north side of Fourteenth Street is technically not a resident of the Village , while one who lives on the south side is .

		But actually , of course , a member of
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	is a person of a sort and not too closely of a place : he is a Bohemian .

		Mr.
Hutchins Hapgood	PERSON	has long been a true -LRB- per - haps the truest -RRB- villager , despite a legal residence up the
Hudson	LOCATION	.

		That `` Playboy of the Editors ' World , '' Mr.
Jack Reed	PERSON	, pauses inevitably in the intervals of his journeys to the seats of war to enjoy , and to be enjoyed by , the group which affects Miss
Polly Holli	PERSON	- day 's restaurant , whether that happens to be in
Provincetown	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, or in Mac - dougal Street , just off
Washington Square	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lincoln Steffens	PERSON	apparently finds quite as much of the intellectual refreshment his soul demands at the
Liberal Club	ORGANIZATION	as at Mrs.
Mabel Dodge	PERSON	's salon in
Fifth Avenue	LOCATION	, or in expounding Christianity to a state 's attorney .

		On the other hand , Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	, who is hardly a Bohemian in any sense and who is probably happiest in the country , has his abode in a
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	flat-house .

		It would be a mistake to draw any very hard and fast lines , or to generalize freely about a group which may be held to include at the one extreme
M. Hippolyte Havel	PERSON	, who washes dishes for Miss
Holliday	PERSON	and refuses to write for any periodical but the `` Anarchist Al - manack , '' and , at the other , Mr.
Louis Unter	PERSON	- meyer , who designs jewelry for a factory in
Jersey	LOCATION	and writes for all the magazines in this country and a few in
England	LOCATION	.

		Never - theless , certain generalizations might be estab - lished , especially by those who perceive the similarities between Bohemians and under - graduates , between the communal spirit of
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	and if
Greenwich Vil	LOCATION	- lage will pardon our saying so that of
Stan	PERSON	- ford , or
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, or Princeton * In the 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct.	DATE	.

		I Quarter , where students have been for gen - erations as much a part of the life as poets , they are lumped off together as a matter of long-established custom , and neither resents the implication .

		But in the Village , where `` Bohemian '' is almost an ineptitude and `` Radical '' is almost a title , there is a feeling that the college is one of those established institutions that require to be combated by the true children of progress and that of all classes undergraduates are the most con - temptibly and irremediably bourgeois .

		How different it seems to those of us who are neither of the college nor of the Village !

		Both institutions how abominable to speak of
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	as an institution !

		are conscious attempts to create a little world apart , to found a convention less oppressive than that of middle-class society .

		The middle classes are so much more concerned about money than about art or scholarship , so much more eager for security than for revolution or for the rehabilitation of the past , so much more desirous of respectability than of easy social intercourse or of good-fellowship .

		Thus both the undergraduate and the Bohemian permit freedoms -LRB- in dress , in speech , in the manners of social intercourse -RRB- which are else - where frowned upon .

		And both of necessity enforce certain restrictions with a rigidity elsewhere unknown .

		In college it is obligatory to look administrative officers askance and to regard policemen without respect ; in
Green	LOCATION	- wich Village it is editors and policemen .

		In both it is adaptability rather than achievement which is the test of personality .

		The fact that adaptability is usually required in the name of individuality only emphasizes the point .

		A person witholit those amiable vices of whose potency
Stevenson	PERSON	once reminded us would be as far from comfortable at a studio party as in a fraternity house .

		There are some differences , it is true .

		The habit of cigarettes is not acceptable among ' ' co-eds , ' ' at least not west of the
Alleghenies	LOCATION	; whereas it is rather demanded of the young women of
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	.

		An interest in sport is expected of the undergraduate ; it is regarded with amused tolerance by the Bo - hemian .

		But what is the essential difference between worshipping a captain of football and idealizing a
Bill Haywood	PERSON	?

		The types which are conspicuous in college communities are so much like those we might identify in a rapid survey of
Bohemia	LOCATION	as to be interchange - able .

		In
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	there is a young man of less than thirty so unspoiled by ten years of sitting about cafe tables and gossiping about magazine offices , so pleasant of manner , so appreciative , so round-eyed , and so child - ishly sleepy that many of his younger con - freres speak of him affectionately by a diminutive ; he could not be duplicated any - where , perhaps , but he is precisely the type which many a college class has known and loved and patronized , almost as much to his resentment as to his delight .

		There is another whose likeness to Oscar Wilde is already dis - tinguishable , though as yet insufficiently culti - vated ; his patent sophistication , his passionate insincerity , his turn for paradox , his intel - lectual impertinence , his facility in icono - clastic exegesis is not he also quite as much of the college as of the Eighteen-Nineties in
London	LOCATION	and the Nineteen-IIundreds in
New York	LOCATION	?

		And there is a young woman , but enough of types .

		The very means of self-expression chosen by
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	is reminiscent of the college .

		A meeting of the formidable board which edits `` The Masses '' must be painfully like the meetings of those boards which edit `` The Chaparral '' at
Stanford	LOCATION	, or `` The Sphinx '' at
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, or `` The Tiger '' at
Princeton	LOCATION	.

		The editors of `` The Masses '' take themselves seriously , but not any more seri - ously than their undergraduate prototypes .

		And if the editor and the cartoonist of `` The Masses '' can boast of being haled into court at the instance of the
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	, there are sometime editors of `` The Sphinx '' who can point to an occasion when they were called before the discipline committee of the faculty of
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nor is `` The Masses '' any more bitterly critical of the established order than are certain college magazines of a similar shape and a like fond - ness for the illustrated anecdote .

		All these outward and possibly trivial mani - festations of likeness between the undergrad - uate and the Bohemian community are but the sign of an inward identity .

		The strength of the college , and its weakness as well , lies in the very fact that it is a community banded together for mutual protection and mutual stimulation under a convention designed to establish kinship among its members .

		That is precisely the strength , and the weakness ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 241 of
Bohemia	LOCATION	.

		Both are sanctuaries .

		Never to have known sanctuary is to have been un - fortunate .

		But always to have known sanctu - ary is never to have reached full stature .

		About every college are perpetual college men , adolescents whose development was arrested just as they were reaching manhood .

		And about
Greenwich Village	LOCATION	are perpetual Bo - hemians who have already paused for ten years in this most interesting , but incomplete , stage of their development .

		The best of the college we are speaking here of the college community to the exclusion of the instruc - tional program is delightful ; but it is sel - dom bracing .

		The best of
Bohemia	LOCATION	is perhaps the pleasantest society in the world ; but it is seldom stimulating .

		The one offers play with - out responsibility ; the other offers gossip without malice .

		Both of these are happy mani - festations of the human spirit , but neither is a substitute for the intellectual intercourse of equals .

		LITERATURE IN WAR AND PEACE .

		Perhaps it is bad taste for Americans , who are apparently set as spectators of the present tournament of nations , to speculate on the literary consequences of the world war .

		But after we have paid our tribute of horror and pity to what are probably the most appalling events of recorded history , our spirits must rise to the majesty of these occurrences ; we must feel that they indicate or portend a great change in human thought .

		There seems to be too much hysteria in the cur - rent comment on the situation .

		For all the gloom there must be a corresponding glory .

		It is an old jest that newspapers publish columns and pages about a prize fight and then salve their conscience by editorials condemning the ring and all its ways .

		The public reads the stories and neglects the editorials and so it probably treats the war news and the preach - ments which accompany it .

		Like Dr.
Brown	PERSON	's
Rab	PERSON	, mankind `` can just never get enough fighting . ''

		Like Budge in ``
Helen	PERSON	's Babies , '' it wants its heroes ' ' all bluggy . ' '

		For ourselves we think that this combative instinct is the glory of our race .

		that it is a main force which keeps humanity from becom - ing dull , listless , enervated , and enslaved to sordid materiality .

		Ideal Love , Religion , and War are the three royal poetic strands in the web of life , and no one of them can be spared in the weaving .

		For a man to believe that there is something better or greater than him - self , whether it be a woman or his countrv or his God , that is the way out of the sty of the world .

		But such high considerations hardly ac - count for the popularity of the present wars .

		That they are popular seems unquestionable .

		None of the peoples concerned have had to be dragooned by their rulers or leaders into the fight .

		Perhaps the commercial era is at an end and a martial era is beginning .

		The com - mercial era has not been all beer and skittles .

		There is an uncommon amount of poverty and misery all over what we denominate the
civ	LOCATION	- ilized world , as is evidenced by the restlessness of the peoples , the vast socialistic agitations .

		Perhaps the dwellers in the slums , the workers in the factories , the men behind the plow , be - lieve that war will give them something , gain or glory , which they could not hope for in peace .

		It is at least an adventure which will lift them out of their dull lives .

		The fascina - tion of uniforms and arms , concerted move - ment , the march , the bivouac , the battle , is always strong .

		Anyhow , the dream of universal and per - petual peace may as well be banished .

		The world had something like such a peace when it lay at the foot of the Roman empire and the record is one of the worst pages in human history .

		We had better recognize that there will always be races or nations or groups of men or single conquerors who will strive for the headship of the world .

		In one of De
Quincey	PERSON	's essays there is an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	apologue about peace which we may be pardoned for quoting .

		In an Asian city , he says , there is a block of polished granite several cubits in each dimension .

		It is protected by a temple , and , the legend goes , once in every hundred years an angel descends and just grazes the top of the block with its wing .

		When the granite shall be entirely worn away by this recurrent visiting , then , and not until then , shall peace reign in the world .

		Certainly it behooves us in
America	LOCATION	not to live in a Fool 's Paradise , dreaming of an impossible peace .

		We are out of the current for the moment , but we do not know when it will eddy around us .

		The saying of the Greek sage to
Croesus	ORGANIZATION	is hackneyed , but does not lose its pith .

		`` 0
Croesus	ORGANIZATION	, when someone happens along who has better iron than you , he will have all this gold ! ''

		Things can not be as they have been when this tornado which has burst over
Europe	LOCATION	has spent its force .

		Among other interests litera - ture will suffer a change .

		For one thing , we shall have a change of heroes .

		From the beginning of literature it has been dominated by the Man of the Sword .

		In Homer and
Virgil	PERSON	, in the
Bible	LOCATION	and the great books of 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	the
East	LOCATION	, in the epics of the Middle Ages , in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and on down to
Scott	LOCATION	, he has been the central figure .

		War and Poetry were one and indissoluble .

		But something like a hundred years ago their divorce was decreed .

		The delights of domesticity , the diversions of low life , began to be exclusively pictured .

		The average , unimportant person came into his own .

		The new , vast reading public wanted to see its own features in print ; and authors who held to the exceptional and significant figures of the lords of humanity were as much out of fashion as ^ Eschylus was in the age of Euripides .

		One evidence of the truth of all this is the cult of
Jane Austen	PERSON	, the attempt made in recent years to claim for her the primacy of the English novel .

		Her clever miniatures of a perfectly insipid society are put forward as superior to the mighty master - pieces of Scott .


Jane Austen	PERSON	lived in the time of the Napoleonic wars , but their greatness and heroisms and terrors have not the faintest reflection in her novels .

		In `` Persuasion '' a group of girls discuss `` prize money '' like so many white-throated sharks .

		Their only con - ception of war is that it might provide an establishment for one of them .

		But we have gone farther afield than the social world in our search for character types .

		We have plunged into the slums , the prisons , the lazarettos , in search of effective charac - ters .

		We have traded the king , the warrior , the thinker , for the village cretin or the city `` tough . ''

		Criminals indeed are furnishing a large proportion of our book population , and with them the detective who follows on their trail .

		Judging by our novel literature , there `` ai n't no ten commandments '' any more .

		It would be invidious in all this welter of story - writing , unredeemed by any gleam of nobility or high purpose or splendor of fate , to pick out instances .

		But there are two story series which have had a great run in
America	LOCATION	, that in which `` Get Rich Quick Wallingford '' figures and the `` Potash and Perlmutter '' set .

		They are undeniably clever and funny , but nobody seems to realize that they are horribly immoral and still more horribly vulgar .

		If war with its seriousness and terror will deliver us from such base conceptions of life as are voiced in such literary work , it will be worth its cost .

		If the present world war influences litera - ture as we think it will , it may possibly also deliver our novels and plays from female domination .

		For fifty years it has been the queen regnant .

		To take English literature alone , the two greatest modern novelists , Mere - dith and
Hardy	PERSON	, have devoted their genius to depicting the intricacies of the feminine mind and character .

		To them man is merely an adjunct to woman .

		They have reversed the Biblical story of the rib .

		And a great line of popular writers Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	.

		Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	, to name only a few have followed suit .

		Playwrights have given us the woman with a past , the woman who did , and all other varieties of assertive females .

		Woman is undoubtedly the most popular institution in the world , and we have no word to say against her glorification ; but we do not believe that her frail form and gentle mind is capable of holding the great passions and thoughts which need to be exhibited in a literary crea - tion of the first class .

		However , recent English literature has not been all feminine revela - tion .


Stevenson	PERSON	kept alive the spirit of manly adventure .

		He had something of a boy 's con - tempt for woman .

		`` Tigers are proper , but girls are not proper , '' says
Bevis	PERSON	in
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	's excellent boys ' story , and that was
Stevenson	PERSON	's spirit .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, Sir Rider
Haggard	PERSON	, and Sir
Conan Doyle	PERSON	-LRB- it seems a piece of irony that the greatest of these should lack the title -RRB- have done the most to keep up the fighting spirit of
England	LOCATION	.

		They have all been Cassandras warning their country of the evils of commercialism and bodying forth figures of the heroic mood .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	seems to us to have been essentially unheroic .

		There is a note of fear , we think , in all his ingenious and interesting literary inventions .

		He seems to dread some great cataclysm coming upon mankind .

		We do not believe this dread is warranted .

		Man has always been equal to his fate , and has fearlessly confronted , if he has not controlled , the elements .

		So far as we can see , God never made anything greater than the human soul .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has believed that the progress of invention will finally do away with war that it will become too deadly .

		Now the deadliest weapon ever invented was the Roman short sword .

		In one of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's battles four hundred thousand human beings were said to have been slain .

		If Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is unheroic , Mr.
Bernard	PERSON	-
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is anti-heroical .

		He has poured ridicule upon heroism such heroism as myriads of men of all classes are displaying to-day on the battlefields of
Europe	LOCATION	, Man does not live by bread alone .

		The commercial era through which we have been passing practically declared that he could and the result is the `` Get Rich Quick Wal - lingfords '' and the `` Potashes and Perlmut - ters . ''

		We are not all going to be like that , Wars are largely protests of the human reason in favor of imagination and high spiritual things .

		They are generally worth the treasure and blood that is poured out in them .

		Would the North and South to-day resign the robe of
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 243 glory which the Civil War threw over them ?

		Could half a century of dull material prog - ress equal the value of that war to us ?

		We believe that the present unparalleled struggle will be equally beneficial ; that it will clear the air like a great thunderstorm ; that it will energize human character ; and that especially it will revitalize literature which was becoming not only commonplace but common .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		HISTORY IN THE MAKING , such as is now being written in blood over great areas of the European continent , has undeniably an in - tensity of interest not to be found in history ready-made and formally written out in the books .

		At the same time , both these kinds of history gain an increased significance when any striking parallelism can be traced be - tween them .

		A fortnight before the German forces operating in
France	LOCATION	had pushed their way almost to the gates of the French capital , Dr.
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	, who knows whereof he speaks by reason of his years of study and observation in
Germany	LOCATION	and his service as war correspondent in the Franco-Prussian conflict of
1870	DATE	, is said to have declared that in two weeks the
Kaiser	PERSON	's troops would reach
Paris	LOCATION	, and , further , that the German army would be found to be unconquerable .

		Pro- fessor
Spenser Wilkinson	PERSON	, occupant of the chair of military history at
Oxford	LOCATION	, said in a recent printed utterance over his own name : `` Thus
Germany	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	have declared in common that they will have their way in
Europe	LOCATION	, and that if it is not accepted they will impose it upon
Europe	LOCATION	by force .

		If they succeed the king of
Prussia	LOCATION	will be the over - lord of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		If
Europe	LOCATION	is to remain free the nations that
Germany	LOCATION	has challenged must defeat and disarm her and compel her to be content to till her own soil and mind her own business , not as a ruler of other nations , but as one among the united states of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		In view of the present manifest determina - tion of the German Kaiser to achieve his end at any cost , a determination that has already mustered into service nearly all the able-bodied men of the empire , the query may arise whether the world is to witness a repe - tition of the desperate measures employed a century and a half ago by Emperor
William	PERSON	's illustrious predecessor on the Prussian throne ,
Frederick	PERSON	the Great .

		In the fifth year of the Seven Years ' War , beset by foes on the east and west in a manner not without its analogies to
Germany	LOCATION	's present situation , the outcome looked dubious enough for the indomitable
Frederick	PERSON	.

		`` But , '' says
Macaulay	PERSON	in a pas - sage now meriting a re-reading , `` the king carried on war as no European power has ever carried on war , except the
Committee of Pub	ORGANIZATION	-
lic Safety	ORGANIZATION	during the great agony of the French Revolution .

		He governed his kingdom as he would have governed a besieged town , not caring to what extent property was de - stroyed , or the pursuits of civil life suspended , so that he did but make head against the enemy .

		As long as there was a man left in
Prussia	LOCATION	, that man might carry a musket as long as there was a horse left , that horse might draw artillery .

		The coin was debased , the civil functionaries were left unpaid , in some provinces civil government altogether ceased to exist .

		But there were still rye-bread and potatoes , there were still lead and gun - powder ; and , while the means of sustaining and destroying life remained ,
Frederick	PERSON	was determined to fight it out to the very last . ''

		Certainly the present situation is not without dire possibilities that give a very real meaning to such pages of history as that from which this quotation is made .

		THE CHARM OF THE PICARESQUE makes it - self felt in many works of literature beside those examples of fiction in which the picaro is avowedly the hero or at any rate the not least interesting character .

		The memoirs of
Casanova	LOCATION	, the autobiography of
Benvenuto Cellini	PERSON	, the revelations of personal traits in the writings of
George Borrow	PERSON	, the account of his erratic course of life left to us by that curious specimen of the amateur tramp .


Josiah Flynt	PERSON	all these and many other sim - ilar writings attract by reason , in part at least , of their picaresque flavor or sugges - tion .

		Spanish dictionaries define the picaro as a rogue , a knave , a loafer not exactly complimentary terms , and yet as Mr.
Locke	PERSON	so well demonstrates in his story of `` The Be - loved Vagabond , '' it is at least theoretically possible to be all three and at the same time to command other feelings than those of re - pulsion and abhorrence .

		This well-nigh uni - versal appeal of the picaresque proves that we are almost all of us endowed with an element of the irresponsible vagabond , the light - hearted , empty-pocketed knight of the road that leads anywhither , the self-confident mas - ter of the day that now is and of the wits bestowed upon us at birth .

		Gil Bias outrages our sense of right a dozen times , but though we fling down the book in resentment , we pick it up again and go on , until at last the fas - cinating rogue outgrows his follies , settles down to a steady life , and the story neces - 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	sarily comes to an end .

		Dr.
Chisholm	PERSON	, in his varied and entertaining `` Recreations of a Physician , '' one of the season 's not least im - portant books , well says at the end of a chapter on the picaro in fiction : `` Such feelings -LSB- of indignation or disapproval -RSB- are , however , evanescent .

		They yield quickly to the charm of the picaro , for this remarkable character possesses the strange faculty of retaining our respect amid all the devious vicissitudes of a dubious career .

		We feel that he has not be - come corrupted by misfortune and roguery , that his heart remains good .

		We are inclined to believe that
Teresa	PERSON	would have made a much better daughter to
Don Sancho de Mendoza	PERSON	than his own ; we recognize
Gil Bias	PERSON	to be better than his masters , Dr.
Sangrado	PERSON	, the Archbishop of
Granada	LOCATION	, the great Duke of
Lerma	LOCATION	; Lazaro himself is superior to the men he serves .

		He asks for so little , some food , and a place where he may sleep quietly , and an occasional respite from the incessant blows of hostile fortune , that we can not refuse him our sympathy .

		A mere waif , he makes an irresistible appeal to our hearts , and therein lies the secret of the success of the picaro in fiction ' ' and not seldom in real life as well .

		THE DECAY OF THE LECTURE as a means of imparting knowledge and communicating in - spiration has been ascribed largely to the rapid increase of printed books .

		The oral instruction of a Colet or Grocyn or Politian or Chalcondylas was sure of its eager hearers , whereas the modern university lecturer is too often listened to with languid indifference , the assumption being that the pith of his dis - course can be readily found in books and `` crammed '' on the eve of examination .

		A late utterance of the editor of `` The Hibbert Journal '' on the decline of the lecture calls attention to the ever-present need of this mode of instruction .

		From his timely re - marks , printed in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post , '' some brief extracts are here not out of place .

		`` Just because the range of modern knowledge is so vast , ' ' he says , ' ' just because the printed sources from which knowledge may be drawn are so multitudinous and con - fusing , there is need of some means by which the student can be placed at the living centre of his subject .

		This can be provided only by the living personality of a master , and to the end of time there will be no other way ... Endow a man with a whole library of well - written books , but leave him without an in - spiring personality at the centre of his subject , and the chances are a hundred to one that he will remain a dabbler . ''

		The importance of the lecturer 's function Dr. Jacks not unnat - urally believes to be greatest in the depart - ment of philosophy , but he urges the revival of the art of lecturing in all fields of teaching and inquiry .

		`` The very causes which have produced its decline clamor for its revival . ''

		Professor
Robert MacDougall	PERSON	has recently -LRB- in `` The Popular Science Monthly '' for Septem - ber -RRB- protested against the excessive and debil - itating use of the pictorial accompaniment lantern slides and moving pictures in lec - tures of a supposedly educational character .

		`` The mind is not taxed but appeased ; the soi-disant teacher exerts himself to anticipate the moment of flagging attention , and out of an abundant store to supply it at each turn with a novel and pleasurable stimulus . ''

		Neither the popular entertainer nor the de - liverer of perfunctory oral discourse to sleepy students is the true lecturer as conceived by Professor Jacks and Professor
MacDougall	PERSON	.

		A ROYAL POET , far more truly an artist and an idealist , if one may credit the assertions of his present-day French admirers , than was the first of the English Stuarts or the re - nowned great-grandson of the Great Elector of
Brandenburg	LOCATION	, is the little-understood ruler of all the Russias .

		The
Paris	LOCATION	newspaper press is naturally at this time markedly cordial and sympathetic in its attitude toward the
Romanoff	PERSON	sovereign at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	we beg his pardon , at
Petrograd	LOCATION	; and from such organs of public opinion as the `` Figaro '' and the `` Gaulois '' a credulous reader would gain the impression that the Czar is one of the most artistically gifted , romantically melancholy , cruelly unappreciated , and altogether Hamlet - like princes ever stretched on the rack of this tough world .

		So fine are said to be his sesthetic sensibilities that he will not tolerate in his domestic environment any work of art in the least discordant with his tastes .

		His chosen authors are stylists , masters of an irreproach - able manner and the farthest possible remove from those crudities and barbarisms that make the volcanic Gorky a torture to his gentle soul .

		Poems from his pen , but necessarily under an assumed name , circulate among his intimates in limited editions privately printed and jeal - ously guarded from an undesired publicity .

		His muse is melancholy , and this pensiveness shows itself also in the music he favors and in the school of painting that elicits his appro - bation .

		He talks poetry and art , we are told , with a quiet appreciation and a w r istful smile that make it all but impossible to see in this modest , deferential , ingratiating gentleman of refined and cultivated tastes the autocratic head of the Russian Empire .

		All this is really
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL delightful , if true ; and it is more than a little puzzling also , but not the first puzzle of the sort in the world 's history .


Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	, involved in almost continuous warfare , and held responsible for the pitiless persecution that the Christians suffered in his reign , was nevertheless the author of the famous ' ' Medi - tations '' which have solaced and strengthened so many thousands of readers , and was in his own person a most worthy example of all that is best in the Stoic philosophy inculcated by his writings .

		CULTURE AND CONQUEST , in their inter-rela - tions , were made the subject of some observa - tions from the pen of
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	when he was holding a
Basel	LOCATION	professorship at the close of the Franco-Prussian War .

		`` In - opportune Considerations '' he entitled the series of four essays then written by him , and from one of them a correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post '' now quotes certain not inopportune passages , as for example : ' ' Cul - ture is , above all , unity of artistic style in all the activities of a people .

		But to know and to have learned much is neither a necessary means of culture nor a mark of it , and if need be agrees excellently with the opposite of culture , barbarism , that is , absence of style , or the chaotic mix-up of all styles . ''

		And , he continues , it is precisely this chaotic mix-up that characterizes so-called German culture .

		`` Even if we had really ceased to copy them -LSB- the French -RSB- , we should not thereby have prevailed over them , but should merely have freed ourselves from them ; only after we had forced an original German culture upon them could there be any talk of a triumph of Ger - man culture .

		In the meantime let us bear in mind that we still depend upon
Paris	LOCATION	in all matters of form , and that we must so depend ; for so far there is no German original culture .

		We all ought to know this of ourselves ; more - over , one of the few who have the right to tell the Germans so in a tone of reproach , has openly disclosed it .

		` We Germans are of yes - terday , ' Goethe once said to
Eckermami	LOCATION	; ` to be sure , for a century we have cultivated our - selves quite diligently , but a couple of cen - turies may yet pass before so much intellectu - ality and higher culture shall have penetrated our people and become universal that one will be able to say of them : It is a long time since they were barbarians . ' '

		As history has re - peatedly shown , the culture of the conquered is all but invincible .

		THE OFFICE OF FICTION-TASTER , as it exists in the
Boston	LOCATION	system of selecting novels for the public library , has its agreeable and also its disagreeable features .

		As in olden times the taster of dishes for the king 's table was exposed to the risk of an occasional mouthful of poison , so the person who consents to stand between the public and the injurious books pressing for admission to the public library may now and then inadvertently swallow a morsel of ill-flavored literature .

		Much fun has been made of the supposed committee of prudish old maids who kept the fiction list of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	up to its high standard of moral purity , but in an age when novels multiply so rapidly as at present almost any severely restrictive system of pur - chase is better than indiscriminate inclusive - ness .

		As to the practical workings of the
Boston	LOCATION	method , the
Examining Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the library has this to say of it in its latest report : `` The process of dealing with works of fiction , with the help of a Reading Com - mittee made up of men and women of widely various interests and tastes , serves well the purpose of selecting the comparatively small number of novels and collected short stories which are purchased under the
Library	ORGANIZATION	's sys - tem of limited supply in this field of literature .

		This system appears to be based upon a wise policy , not only in the service of the public , but also in the expenditure of the Library funds .

		Since the accession of a single novel means the purchase of twenty or more copies - to supply all the shelves , in different parts of the city , on which it must be placed the limiting of purchase is imperative .

		A Read -
ing Committee	ORGANIZATION	, made up of representatives of diverse races and religions , and acting merely in an advisory capacity , is well calculated to give the Trustees the help they need .

		We do not find that any racial or religious influence is predominant in the working of this plan . ' '

		PROFESSORIAL LIABILITY TO IMPOSITION , the high-minded scholar 's unsuspecting attitude toward the selfish designs of the less high - minded , is so familiar to the world both as a favorite theme in fiction and as a frequent subject for remark in daily life , that novelty can hardly be claimed for any illustrations that may by chance from time to time come to one 's notice .

		Professor
C. Hanford Hen	ORGANIZATION	- derson , in his latest book , `` What Is It to Be Educated ? ''

		calls attention in his closing pages to certain excessive charges imposed , not upon idealists and dreamers alone , it is true , but upon few that are less able , pecuni - arily , to bear them .

		He speaks incidentally of having in his own person been the victim , or the - intended victim , of unscrupulous medical practice .

		`` I have had a physician lie to me , '' he relates , `` in order to bring me unnecessarily 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	to his office a second time .

		I have had one charge me the regular fee for telling me that he could do nothing for me and that I must consult some one else ... Surgery seems par - ticularly rapacious .

		I have known a profes - sor 's family to lose its
summer	DATE	vacation because one of the children developed appen - dicitis , and for that very simple operation , a removal of the appendix , was charged a thou - sand dollars .

		I have known a wholesome Har - vard boy to get into the hands of a
Boston	LOCATION	dentist , and to be carried along , week after week , unnecessarily , until the bill amounted to one quarter of the boy 's yearly income , a double theft of time and money . ''

		He takes occasion to remark that `` that accusing docu - ment , the preface to ' A Doctor 's Dilemma , ' has never been successfully answered . ' '

		After all , even the sorest victim of chicanery may comfort himself with the reflection that the impostor is sure in the end to discover that he has cheated himself .

		WHAT THE PEOPLE ARE READING at present would seem to be chiefly the newspaper bulle - tin boards and the war extras issued with lavish prodigality by the newspaper pub - lishers .

		Several of the
London	LOCATION	daily journals that ordinarily extend to twelve and sixteen pages of miscellaneous news now appear in editions of eight pages devoted chiefly to con - flicting rumors and meagre censored dis - patches from the seat of war .

		Few readers care for anything but war news , the people can think of but one thing at a time , and even the American baseball enthusiast follows with languid interest the unsanguinary combat of the diamond while so much fiercer a struggle is holding the world in breathless suspense .

		Even the advertising pages of our journals show the temper of the times .

		English cloth - iers call attention to their `` Active Service Kits , '' steamship lines have greatly modified or curtailed their solicitations of ocean traffic , the announcements of church services are not free from reference to the all-absorbing theme , and in the book-advertising section of one 's newspaper such literary wares as Mr.
W. Douglas Newton	PERSON	's story entitled `` War '' -LRB- de - scribing `` the progress of an invading army through a country '' and telling `` with the cold accuracy of a camera just what happens as the army advances '' -RRB- are brought conspic - uously into notice .

		We may deplore this ab - sorption of attention in so gruesome a theme , and the closet philosopher may urge a course of reading in the `` Meditations '' of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	and the `` Enchiridion '' of
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	as a corrective ; but no radical cure of our present distemper is possible until the malady has run its course .

		The patient must get a good deal worse before he can begin to get a little better .

		THE LIBRARY EDITOR is a comparatively new official on the public library staff , and his duties are not yet matter of common knowl - edge .

		Such a library as that of
New York	LOCATION	, for example , issues a variety of publications , chiefly bibliographical , and the supervision of their preparation and issue takes time and thought and special knowledge .

		This post in that institution has lately , it is announced , been offered to and accepted by Mr.
Edmund Lester Pearson	PERSON	, whose editing of `` The Old Librarian 's Almanack '' was the enlivenment -LRB- and the bewilderment , not to say the befool - ment -RRB- of the library world a few years ago .

		From the
Cleveland Public Library	ORGANIZATION	's current Report we learn that a library editor has lately been appointed there , his , or her , duties embracing `` several related forms of work : the editing of library publications , annotation , the duties of staff secretary , and a share in the publicity work of the library . ''

		The ex - cellent ' ' Open Shelf , '' a briefly but judiciously annotated monthly book-list , is prepared by the library editor , and other annotated lists on special topics are also the work of her hand .

		Last year she enlarged her sphere of usefulness by giving a course of ten lectures on the principles of book selection to the apprentice class , and two lectures , on `` Trans - lations of Foreign Literature '' and `` Library Printing , '' to the
Western Reserve Library School	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE PROGRESS OF Ro , the universal language invented by Mr.
Edward P. Foster	PERSON	of
Mari	PERSON	- etta ,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and described by him as `` an a priori language , based on the analysis and classification of ideas , '' continues in spite of the clash of nations and the crumbling of kingdoms .

		`` World-Speech , '' the monthly publication by which Mr.
Foster	PERSON	spreads the knowledge of his proposed medium for cos - mopolitan intercourse , has reached its twenty - first number , and in this number is printed a list of fifty-three short and presumably useful sentences , in four languages , Ro , English , French , and German .

		For instance , what could be more serviceable , in certain easily conceivable circumstances , than a universal form for the following idea : `` I love you .

		Will you marry me ? ''

		An emergency might arise , too , requiring a universally intelligible expression of the fact that `` cats kill some birds , but not ostriches or eagles , '' or that `` the father of the boy bought him a horse yesterday . ' '

		THE STORY OF A MAGAZINE AND ITS FOUXDEK .

		* So consuming a passion for accomplishing difficult undertakings , so extraordinary a ca - pacity for hard , grinding toil , so remarkable a power for enduring the hardships and priva - tions incident to penury , have rarely been pic - tured in autobiography as they are presented in Mr.
S. S. McClure	PERSON	's account of the struggles of his boyhood , youth , and early manhood in achieving his ambition to get an education and , after that , to carry to success his ventures in the field of publishing .

		Bora in
Ireland	LOCATION	, of Scottish and Huguenot ancestry , the future founder of the popular magazine bearing his name received as his most valuable inheritance a sturdy constitution and a self-reliance that made him the master of any situation in which he was likely to find himself .

		To the mother we naturally look for some of the traits that distinguish the son , and we do not look in vain .

		The opening chapter of ' ' My Autobiography ' ' contains this passage descriptive of
Elizabeth Gaston McClure	PERSON	: '' My mother was a girl of unusual physical vigor and great energy , and had always done farm - work .

		She was able to do a man 's work and a woman 's work at the same time .

		After keeping up with the men in the fields all day , she would come in and get supper for them at night .

		After her marriage she continued to work on her father 's farm , and my father continued as one of my grandfather
McClure	PERSON	's workmen .

		It was in my grandfather
Gaston	PERSON	's house at the Frocess that I , the first child of this marriage , was born . ''

		The father 's early death , the mother 's emi - gration with her four boys to
America	LOCATION	, their desperate struggle for existence in
Indiana	LOCATION	, the eldest son 's many and varied industrial efforts and at least partial successes , the kindling of his ambition to become an educated man , his heroic storming of the outworks of
Knox Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege with
fifteen cents	MONEY	in his pocket and limit - less courage in his breast , the means he resorted to in order to keep soul and body together dur - ing his seven years of preparatory and college study , his seven-years engagement to the daughter of a
Knox	PERSON	professor who frowned on the penniless student 's suit for her hand , and his ultimate success in this as in other cherished plans , are all related in the uncircumlocutory style natural to one more given to the doing of deeds than to their rhetorical embellishment .

		Yet there were certain tasks so unsuited to this eager youth 's temperament that , after under - taking them , he felt the hopelessness of con - * MY AUTOBIOGRAPHY .

		tinuing the struggle , and ran away from his job , as he expresses it .

		One of these uncon - genial labors was school-teaching ; the hum - drum of it he could not endure , and though he thrice tried to hold himself down to the dull agony of the country school , he abandoned the attempt each time before the term was ended .

		Rather than fill the part of pedagogue he would endure such rigors of impecuniosity as are pictured in the following passage from his life at
Galesburg	LOCATION	: '' Nearly every night the pail of water in my room used to freeze solid and swell up in the center .

		I had a fur cap by this time , and I used always to eat my meals walking up and down the room , with my cap and woolen mittens on .

		I seldom had anything to eat but bread , and it froze so hard that it was full of ice and hard to chew .

		I can not remember anything more dismal than those meals in that terribly cold room .

		A very poor divinity student roomed with me for a few weeks a solemn , pious fellow with protruding teeth ; and I remember , one
Sunday	DATE	when we came home from church and had nothing but cold corn-meal mush for our
Sunday	DATE	dinner , he varied his usual blessing as we confronted the dish , and said : ' Lord , bless , we pray thee , this miserable food to our perishing bodies . '

		Going to bed , however , was the greatest hardship .

		The sheets were so cold , and had been cold for so long , that getting into bed was like plunging naked into a snow-drift .

		At night I usually studied in the public jibrary , or in the office of the hotel , or in the waiting-room of the depot , where there was always a red-hot stove . ''

		Mind triumphed over body to such an extent that the young student , as he tells us , got so that he could go to bed supperless without feeling any great discomfort ; and he might even have carried this experiment in cheap living so far as to establish the fact that , in an academic atmosphere and with congenial studies to stimulate the intellect , starvation itself is not a disagreeable experience , had not his aspect betrayed the critical condition of affairs in that comfortless dormitory and caused his removal to the house of some good people who soon restored him to physical vigor .

		Initiation into the mysteries of printing had come to Mr.
McClure	PERSON	when he was attending school at
Valparaiso	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, where he served for two months as printer 's devil on `` The Vidette , ' ' a newspaper published there .

		Type - setting and the making-up of the paper were quickly learned by the versatile lad , and there - fore he was not ill fitted for the work that came to him later in college , when the editorship of `` The Knox College Student '' fell to his lot .

		Of this work he writes : '' In editing the Knox Student I followed ex - actly the same principles of editing - that I after - ward followed in editing McClure 's Magazine .

		Whatever I know about editing I knew in the 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	beginning .

		We had , after the manner of college papers , a long staff of contributing editors , an Exchange Editor , a Society Editor , etc. .

		I remem - ber that at first some of them were very indignant at the way in which I cut and modified their copy .

		There was especial indignation because I cut all such items as : '
Charley Brown	PERSON	was seen walking across the campus with a vision in white last
Friday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	.

		What about it , Charley ? '

		Phillips and I had undertaken to make the paper lively and interesting , and we did n't consider this form of humor either one or the other . ''

		The
Phillips	PERSON	here mentioned was , like his friend and co-worker , destined for greater things in the publishing world beyond the col - lege gates .

		He is at present editor of `` The American Magazine . ''

		Mr.
McClure	PERSON	himself became editor of ' ' The Wheelman ' ' and gained a further acquaintance with the making of printed matter in the DeVinne printing house before he entered on his chosen work of syndi - cate publication and , later , the building up of a popular monthly magazine .

		The strug - gles of the syndicate to win a footing make an absorbing story , as do the early fortunes and misfortunes of the magazine . ' '

		I launched the syndicate , ' ' writes Mr.
McClure	PERSON	, ' '
Novem	DATE	- ber 16 ,
1884	DATE	.

		The first thing I syndicated was a two-part story by
H. H. Boyesen	PERSON	.

		I had agreed to pay Boyesen
$ 250	MONEY	for it , and although some newspapers in large cities paid as high as
$ 20	MONEY	`` for the right to print it , my returns on the story aggregated
$ 50	MONEY	less than the story cost me . ''

		This was a serious situa - tion for the adventurous young man , as he was not only without funds for current expenses , but he was saddled with a considerable debt .

		The story of the hazardous but ultimately very successful enterprise continues : '' I went down to the Century office and bor - rowed
$ 5	MONEY	from a young man I had worked with there it must be remembered that I knew almost no one in
New York	LOCATION	and with this
$ 5	MONEY	I went to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		There I sold two stories , the one by Boyesen and another by '
J. S. of Dale	PERSON	, ' for
$ 45	MONEY	to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	papers .

		I borrowed some money from a relative there , and went on to
Washington	LOCATION	, where I also sold my stories , then home .

		As soon as I got back to
New York	LOCATION	, I went to
Boston	LOCATION	.

		There Mr.
Rowland	PERSON	, of Outing , got me a pass to
Albany	LOCATION	.

		... At
Albany	LOCATION	I sold the service for
$ 5	MONEY	a week .

		When I got back to
New York	LOCATION	I found letters from several important newspapers , such as the
St. Paul Pioneer Press	ORGANIZATION	and the San Fran - cisco
Argonaut	ORGANIZATION	which I had written to but had not heard from before agreeing to take the service at
$ 8	MONEY	a week .

		Then I realized that I was started .

		I paid
Boyesen	PERSON	part of what I owed him , and lived on the rest , paying him a little more , as I could .

		Week after week and month after month I fell short in this way , and got deeper and deeper into debt .

		I got along by paying my authors
$ 10	MONEY	or
$ 20	MONEY	on account .

		I paid out a little less than I collected , and my actual working capital was the money I owed authors .

		I made no secret of this , and the men who wrote for me were usually willing to wait for their money , as they realized that my syndicate was a new source of revenue which might eventually become very profitable to them .

		And it did . ''

		Similarly the history of the magazine that was started on no capital and infinite courage in
1893	DATE	is full of hairbreadth escapes from disastrous failure and long periods of sta - tionary or declining fortunes , followed at last by glorious success .

		Faith and persistence seem to have served admirably in place of cap - ital , and it must have required a very firm faith as well as considerable credit to carry on an enterprise that was losing
four thousand dollars	MONEY	a month , which was the average deficit of the magazine in its third year .

		But
two years later	DATE	it showed a profit of
five thousand dollars	MONEY	for each issue , and its standing was thenceforth secure .

		Here is a glimpse of the heart-breaking struggle that preceded that assured prosperity : '' During the
first summer	DATE	of the magazine 's ex - istence , in the panic year of
' 93	DATE	, I was staying with Professor
Henry Drummond	PERSON	at
Northfield	LOCATION	, where he was visiting
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's school .

		We took long walks together ; and one day , when we were off in the country , sitting on the grass , I told
Drummond	PERSON	that I did not see how I could possibly put through the task I had undertaken that I did not feel strong enough to do it , and that I always seemed to be undertaking more than I could do .

		I have never forgotten his reply .

		He said : ' Unless a man undertakes to do more than he possibly can , he will never do all that he can . ' ''

		One reason for the early success of '' Mc - Clure 's Magazine '' is expressed in the words of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	to its editor : `` It takes the young man to find the young man . ''

		Mr.
Mc	PERSON	- Clure was young and on the look-out for new talent , and so the new talent came inevitably his way .

		The list of gifted young authors he discovered or helped to discover is a long one and includes such names as
Robert Louis Ste	PERSON	- venson , Sir
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	, and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		A later element in the magazine 's prosperity has been its editor 's alertness to the temper of the times in matters of social and govern - mental reform , and his system for giving these public questions the most thorough and intel - ligent treatment in articles written by experts in the popular presentation of timely and important topics .

		The author of `` My Autobiography '' shows himself to be , as he frankly confesses himself to be , a man of one set of interests .

		His busi - ness and his pleasure are one ; his vocation is his avocation ; his daily task is his daily rec - reation .

		Thus his book is the story of his work
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 249 in the great new world to which he came as a boy with eager expectancy , and it is little else .

		But this is not said in depreciation .

		Unity is a quality of art , and the simple sincerity and singleness of purpose shown in the narrative will not count against it .

		Incidental glimpses are furnished , too , of the wide range of lit - erary workers with whom the author 's search for new writers has brought him into more or less friendly relationship .

		Portraits of many of these are reproduced , with other appropriate illustrations .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		THE APOSTLE OF EUGENICS .

		* Thirty years ago , in
England	LOCATION	, the present writer had the good fortune to read
Galton	PERSON	J s `` Human Faculty , '' then almost a new book .

		It is impossible to forget the impression made by its originality , suggestiveness , and applica - tion of scientific methods to the study of every - day experiences .

		Vague questionings of the human mind , stimulated in the first instance , possibly , by the works of
Poe	PERSON	, here found at least partial answers ; while it seemed that a great new field lay open for fruitful investi - gation .

		At the same time , little as the author may have intended it , metaphysical specula - tion was encouraged .

		The greater territory annexed by science had of course greater boundaries , and many headlands jutting into the sea of the unknown , from which it was easy to make metaphysical excursions .

		Now , after the lapse of years , bringing a much bet - ter knowledge of
Galton	PERSON	and his works , the old impression still remains .

		The subtleties of modern psychology , the revelations of twen - tieth century experimenters , have in a sense rendered
Galton	PERSON	's writings obsolete .

		Neverthe - less , they may be read with advantage , not only for their significant statements of fact , but principally perhaps as examples of bold - ness combined with sagacity , almost naive originality cheeked by continual appeals to experience .

		The eugenics movement , of which we hear so much to-day , is primarily due to
Galton	LOCATION	; and while the control of human hered - ity may not altogether follow the lines he sug - gested , it will always be recognized that he first won public consideration for the subject .

		When he died in
1911	DATE	, at the age of eighty - nine , he left funds for the support of a professor - ship and laboratory in the
University of Lon	ORGANIZATION	- don , dedicated to the cause of eugenics and the study of human heredity .

		* THE LIFE , LETTERS , AND LABOURS OP
FRANCIS GALTON	PERSON	.

		By
Karl Pearson	PERSON	.

		Volume I. Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		The
Galton	PERSON	Professor , Dr.
Karl Pearson	PERSON	, has considered it his duty and his pleasure to prepare an elaborate work on the life of Sir
Francis Galton	PERSON	, giving all significant details obtainable concerning his ancestry and en - vironment .

		The first volume , covering the years from birth to marriage -LRB-
1853	DATE	-RRB- is now before us .

		In
1909	DATE	,
Galton	PERSON	himself published a charming and interesting book , `` Memories of My Life , '' which sufficiently described the main facts of his career .

		The new work is far more detailed , and very profusely illustrated .

		It gives full particulars concerning the Gal - tons and their ancestors , and also much about the
Darwin	PERSON	family ,
Francis Galton	PERSON	and
Charles Darwin	PERSON	both being grandsons of Eras - mus
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Pearson	PERSON	, in his pref - ace , disarms the critic by the following frank remarks : '' I am fully aware that the indolent reader will find much in this work which he does not want and which has but little interest for him .

		It is intended fundamentally as a permanent memorial to the Founder of the
Galton Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	, and em - braces material which may easily perish or be ultimately lost sight of .

		If the said reader will only wait a few years , I have little doubt that my material will be strained of its more solid content and presented to him in that light and cheap form , which we are told is a first necessity of the modern book market .

		My object is a different one , namely , to issue a volume to some extent worthy of the name of the man it bears , which may be studied hereafter by those who wish to understand him , his origin and his aims , rather than to furnish an evening 's amusement for readers , however numerous , who would just as readily study any other biography as that of
Galton	LOCATION	, if only it chanced to be entertaining . ''

		The `` indolent reader '' will , however , enjoy looking at the pictures , and if at all clever at skipping , will readily discover a large amount of generally interesting matter , mixed with materials which are printed mainly as matters of record , to be used by more serious students .

		He will marvel at the precocity of the young - ster , who , the day before his fifth birthday , wrote the following letter to his sister .

		- '' My dear Adele : I am four years old and I can read any English book .

		I can say all the Latin substantives and adjectives and active verbs , besides 52 lines of Latin poetry .

		I can cast up any sum in addition and can multiply by 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 10 .

		I can also say the pence table .

		I read French a little and I know the clock . ''

		In his old age
Galton	PERSON	said of his early accom - plishments : `` In middle life I feared that I had been an intolerable prig , and cross-ques - tioned many old family friends about it , but was invariably assured that I was not at all a 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	prig ... and that I was a nice little child . ''

		In his fifth year he was placed in a dame 's school , and remained there for three years .

		The head mistress reported very highly of lit - tle
Francis	PERSON	, and once added `` the young gen - tleman is always found studying the abstruse sciences . ' '

		At the age of eight the boy made his will , which begins as follows : '' I ,
Francis Galton	PERSON	of the Larches near
Birming	LOCATION	- ham , make this my last Will and Testament - I give to my dearest sister Adele for her great kind - ness in teaching me all my English Books , my Watch , and all my Compound Money and
Collec	PERSON	- tion of Beetles To Bessy , my Minerals and Shells To Lucy , my Hygrometer and Desk To
Emma	PERSON	, my Medals ... '' At the age of fourteen we find him at a typi - cal English boarding school , writing a diary of which the following is a fragment : ''
Monday , April 18	DATE	I knocked a fellow down for throwing a brick at me .


Tuesday , April 19	DATE	I thrashed a snob for throwing stones .


Wednesday , April 20	DATE	One of the boys bought a half-crown trumpet which made a tremendous row .


Thursday , April 21	DATE	We bought a birch pro bono publico for 15 shillings .


Friday , April 22	DATE	A tremendous row in the streets , on account of a blaguard thrashing one of our boys .


Monday , April 25 Saw the 1st swallow this 3	DATE	r ear .

Wednesday , April 27 Got 20	DATE	lines of Virgil .


Tuesday	DATE	,
May 3	DATE	Got the syntax to write out for drawing a picture of a race .


Sunday	DATE	,
May 8	DATE	Arnold preached .

		A fellow gave me a thrashing in the street . ''

		The `` indolent reader '' will not fail to be interested in the details of
Galton	PERSON	's medical education and life at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, of his travels in
Europe	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Syria	LOCATION	, and later in tropical
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The African expedition was one of scientific exploration , and upon his re - turn he was at once recognized as a distin - guished geographer .

		Like many other capable men ,
Galton	PERSON	had more powers than he could well make use of .

		Professor
Pearson	PERSON	remarks that during many years of friendship he never saw him handle the pencil , yet in his youth he could draw with skill .

		Among the many sketches reproduced is an excellent one of the Bishop 's Gateway at
Liege	LOCATION	, as it appeared in
1838	DATE	.

		It probably has been injured or destroyed in the present deplorable war .

		At the end of his discussion of
Galton	PERSON	's ancestry , Professor
Pearson	PERSON	gives a very in - teresting analysis of his physical and mental characteristics , and endeavors to determine how these agree with the qualities of various ancestors .

		In concluding he says : ' ' Thus as most men
Francis Galton	PERSON	was physically and mentally a blend of many ancestral traits .

		Whether they were ` unit characters ' or not concerns us little here .

		What we do realize is that they were not the product of environ - ment , whether of home or school or college . ''

		Thus we find `` nature '' emphasized , and `` nur - ture ' ' belittled ; a point of view nearly oppo - site to that of
Lester Ward	PERSON	, which we recently discussed in these columns .

		The difference of attitude no doubt has arisen largely from cir - cumstances .


Francis Galton	PERSON	's life , projected against the relatively uniform background of English middle-class life , stands out promi - nently because of the man 's inherited qualities .


Lester Ward	PERSON	, in a relatively new country of infinitely varied circumstances and opportuni - ties , could not fail to observe how these condi - tioned the development and success of men .

		Both ' ' nature ' ' and ' ' nurture ' ' are potent and necessary , and any social programme which overlooks either is sure to result in disaster .

		Miss ELLEN KEY 'S SOCIALISM .

		* One imagines it was her individualism that led Miss
Ellen Key	PERSON	to write `` The Younger Generation , '' a book on socialism .

		The in - dividual is never indifferent to her : she is far too passionate , too intense , to value any - thing so abstract and unreal as a mass .

		In other words , she is a woman and a poet first .

		and after that a social theorist .

		In her bias in favor of the individual , she only reflects that fierce individualism of the North which struck and even daunted the imagination of
Europe	LOCATION	in the grim and lonely figure of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and outraged so many sensi - bilities in the remorseless egotism of Striiid - berg .

		Politically Ibsen and Miss
Ellen Key	PERSON	are poles apart ; spiritually which is all that matters they are really near together .

		She is a socialist for the same reason that he was an anarchist : because of an intense desire to bring about a greater freedom in the de - velopment of personality .

		Miss Key is a radical , of course ; but she is a fastidious radical .

		She does not believe in the efficacy of easy nostrums ; she is re - freshingly free from those very illusions we have no right to expect feminist leaders to have rid themselves of , as yet .

		She can , for example , be as heartily contemptuous of the vote as an American cynic sipping his whiskey and water in a club window ; she can speak of * THE YOUNGER GENERATION .

		But it is significant that she rarely chooses to do so .

		These things political rights will come to women .

		Well , then , it - is necessary to be prepared for something else ; it is necessary to keep one 's eye fixed on the end rather than the means ; and the end is an indefinite enhancement of life through the enrichment of the individual .

		Without knowing precisely what Miss Key 's spiritual history has been , one hazards the guess that she became a socialist only after a prolonged and anxious weighing of the issues .

		Like so many other socialists of our time , she has not been without a fear of ultimate democ - racy .

		She has doubtless shuddered -LRB- as Wil - liam
James	PERSON	shuddered -RRB- before the vision of a world transformed into a huge Chautauqua assembly , peaceful , stuffed with plenty , shock - ingly inert .

		For the values she prizes are never cheap values ; they are the reverse ; they are even -LRB- as in the case of marriage -RRB- a little too mystical and remote for the average man .

		They are often vague , but they are always ideal values and they are always char - acteristically feminine values .

		So it is natural that what she demands of socialism is that it shall produce not con - tented men , but better men .

		She has no wish to eliminate struggle ; she wishes rather to persuade herself that socialism will not elim - inate struggle , and she does persuade herself at least .

		A civilization that can not produce superior men is valueless .

		She is not in - different to the average man .

		She believes that the two rise together , and that the aver - age man is helpless without natural leaders .

		If he can not breed them , he will not even hold his own ; he will slip back .

		On the other hand , we do not expect a
Darwin	LOCATION	to be born in
Tierra del Fuego	LOCATION	; there is , of course , action and reaction .

		If she turns to social - ism , it is largely because she believes socialism will afford a better environment for the man of genius .

		Many vigorous opponents of socialism now concede that it is possible to improve the ma - terial condition of men in the gross .

		But , they say , you will do so only by depressing the whole human group , by perilously cur - tailing the opportunities of the fortunate few and by the fierce and stupid suppression of individual initiative .

		Miss Key does not blink this danger of the domination of the herd .

		She knows that democracies have not always been ideal breeding places of exceptional men .

		-LRB- She points to
Switzerland	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	. -RRB-

		There is a peril , but to offset that possible waste she points to the vast , the un - guessed release of energy that might result if the whole mass of mankind were miracu - lously to enjoy a place in the sun .

		Who can say how human progress might be accelerated if all the units of brain power born in each generation could be connected somehow with the driving wheel of civilization ?

		Is it not conceivable that we should get on faster ?

		Peasant stock has given us many men of genius , but only the strongest have been able to climb up , to survive the ordeal and genius is not always strong physically .

		In the face of this alluring possibility , she per - suades herself easily , far too easily , that the proletariat will succeed where the middle class has failed that it will be permanently idealistic .

		But , in the first place , this is a thing that has never happened to any class in society , and , in the second , we have abso - lutely no reason to believe that the proletariat is composed of better stuff than the middle class .

		It is even idle to contend that the great movement for social reform among the workers is in the main a disinterested move - ment .

		To admit that it is not , is not to criticize or belittle socialism .

		A disinterested move - ment could never accomplish so vast a task as the socialists have in mind .

		But if socialism is going to confer any ad - vantage on society , it will have to be a skep - tical and wary socialism , a socialism that has learned to distrust the organization that now makes it strong .

		And this is the gist of Miss Key 's message in ' ' The Younger Generation . ' '

		It is a warning to socialists , though not to socialists alone .

		We live in an age of associa - tion , following upon an age in which indi - vidualism had reached the homicidal stage , and we have carried organization too far . ' '

		The atmosphere created by association makes those who live in it ` devoid of responsibility and remorse , ' to borrow one of
Kierkegaard	ORGANIZATION	's profound sayings of the dangers of shared activity . ''

		Miss Key is far from being alone in urging us to be on our guard against the so-called `` social conscience . ''

		All that is deep and valuable in the human spirit is ma - tured in silence and in lonely meditation .

		We can not save our souls in a group .

		`` What is public opinion ? ' '

		asked
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		And he answered , '' It is private indolence . ' '

		A social - ist state which put down private opinion would be a social disaster , no matter how comfortable its members might be .

		So would a socialist state that interfered with the free development of its citizens .

		The servile state has no part in her dreams of the future .

		And socialists above all must rise to an under - standing of the precise virtue there is in association , cooperation in the business of getting food and other material things ; but 252 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	in the life of the spirit an intense and even fierce independence , an individualism as vigorous and uncompromising as that of Nietzsche himself .

		It is characteristic of Miss Key 's idealism that she accepts this communistic ideal with - out a rigid examination of the underlying economic argument .

		How is socialism to be brought about ?

		What is to be the machinery ?

		She does not concern herself with all that .

		She says simply : `` I do not understand it . ''

		Her acceptance of its ideal is the result of her woman 's revolt a sentimental revolt , if you will against suffering that she believes to be needless .

		Human society can not remain indifferent ; it must find a way out .

		Being impatient of arguments , she does not herself argue .

		Indeed , she distrusts intellectualism altogether ; she relies largely on intuition .

		She would infect you with her enthusiasm rather than convince your mind .

		She speaks always as a seer rather than as a thinker , and doubtless she is wise to do so .

		By way of postscript , one would add that there is included in this volume an essay on universal peace .

		In a recent
London	LOCATION	dispatch Mr.
Francis Grierson	PERSON	was reported to have remarked that the great European war will doubtless overwhelm many Utopian philoso - phies .

		One can only say for Miss
Ellen Key	PERSON	that she is not a peace advocate of the `` im - possibilist '' school .

		Having said so much , however , one really feels justified in saying no more for the present .

		It is undeniably a sad time for idealism of whatever sort .

		* Mr.
Sidney Low	PERSON	's ``
Egypt	LOCATION	in Transition '' is a well-written book of travel .

		It is , more - over , a fresh and painstaking study of the problems involved in the administration of tropical dependencies .

		Half of the volume relates to
Egypt	LOCATION	proper and is made up of chapters dealing with the physical aspect of the country , the life of the people , the agencies of government , the reforms introduced in the past quarter-century by English administra - tors and advisers .

		The first twelve or fifteen chapters , however , are devoted to a record of impressions of the

		think of it only as the scene of
Gordon	PERSON	's tragic death , the theatre of
General Kitchener	ORGANIZATION	's many brilliant exploits , and a field of occasional friction with the French .

		In some introduc - tory pages which he contributes to Mr.
Low	PERSON	's book ,
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	avows the opinion that , although the form of government maintained by the English in the
Sudan	LOCATION	is both unique and singularly successful , there are not a dozen people in all
England	LOCATION	-LRB- with the excep - tion of experts , who might be numbered on the fingers of one hand -RRB- who could give an approximately accurate account of what that form of government is .

		None the less , the
Sudan	LOCATION	is a region two-thirds as large as
India	LOCATION	, with a population of three millions , rich in resources and economic possibilities , and the scene of some of the most interesting of con - temporary experiments in the domain of trop - ical statecraft .

		In the
Introduction	ORGANIZATION	mentioned Lord Cromer explains very clearly and with unimpeachable authoritativeness the essentials of English administrative policy in the
Sudan	LOCATION	and puts the reader in a position to under - stand rather better the transformations re - corded in Mr. Low 's chapters .

		As the title of the book indicates , the author is writing of a country whose life and institu - tions are undergoing rapid change .

		It is only within the past sixteen years that the terri - tory has been drawn definitely within the British sphere of dominion , and its govern - ment and life have been subjected to a trans - formation symbolized perhaps most adequately by the rising of the present splendid city of
Khartoum	LOCATION	on the ruins of the old human warren which bore that name .

		In Mr.
Low	PERSON	's opinion , the administrators of the
Sudan	LOCATION	are more fortunate than those whose theatre of action is countries thickly grown over with the tradition and inheritance of the past , such as
India	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The ground has been cleared for them by war and revolution and they can lay their own foundations and build upon them .

		Under the agreement of
1899	DATE	the territory is a condominium of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	, each party possessing a half - interest .

		In effect , it is administered by En - glish officials , with the assistance of Egyptian subordinates , and defended by a force of Egyptian and Sudanese troops under English command ; and , inasmuch as Englishmen are managing the affairs of the territory openly and independently , there is no need to keep up , as is kept up in
Egypt	LOCATION	, the fiction of their being `` advisers '' to native administrators .

		As explained in
Lord Cromer	LOCATION	's Introduction , the success with which the English adminis - trators have met is attributable , first , to the fact that the form of government is singularly
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 253 adapted to the peculiar condition and require - ments of the country ; second , to the unusual measure of independence which the Sudanese officials have enjoyed ; and third , to their ex - cellent pay and the generous rules governing their vacations .

		Both
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	and Mr. Low record experiences and observations which should be pondered by Americans hav - ing to do with government in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		With respect to
Egypt	LOCATION	, the author makes clear the fact that the English do not govern it , but only govern its governors .

		The prom - ise that was made in
1882	DATE	not to annex
Egypt	LOCATION	or incorporate it in the British Empire he declares to have been ' ' given in haste and with an inadequate knowledge of the facts . ' '

		If the facts had been known , he avers , the promise would never have been given at all .

		`` But , '' he goes on to say , `` given it was ; and the policy it suggests has been steadily kept in view .

		Honestly and laboriously we have been trying to pave the way for complete internal autonomy under native direction . ' '

		The Egyp - tian Turk , it is freely admitted , is not fond of British rule .

		With the individual English - man he can sometimes get on pretty well , but for English government he has small liking , even though he may himself be doing well under it .

		The system of control prevailing under the British occupation is characterized aptly as `` government by inspection and authoritative advice . ''

		Mr. Low regards it as by no means entirely satisfactory , and he points out as its more conspicuous defects its makeshift character , the halting administra - tion of criminal justice , and the fetters im - posed by vexatious international pledges and restrictions .

		Especially does he deplore the effects of the capitulations , the treaties and conventions under which Europeans in the East are exempted from the jurisdiction of the local tribunals .

		That there was once ample justification for these agreements he readily admits ; but he is insistent that they are no longer needed and that they ought to be abolished .

		Indeed , the author would have his country go so far as to dismiss alto - gether the fiction of a temporary occupation , proclaim
Egypt	LOCATION	a British protectorate , and make known to the world that the British Em - pire is , and will continue , responsible for the territory 's external security and internal order .

		With
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	formally an - nexing
Bosnia	LOCATION	and
Herzegovina	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	seizing the Tripolitaine , he feels that the self - restrained course of the English in
Egypt	LOCATION	is rather distinctly creditable to English diplo - macy .

		Of the strength and prospects of the Nationalist movement in the country he has a poor opinion ; although he is bound to con - clude that for English dominance there is lit - tle affection .

		`` The peasantry , '' he says , `` do not know us ; the superior classes do not want us . ' '

		And he specially warns against the idea that
Egypt	LOCATION	is being , or will be , Christianized and that
Mohammedan	DATE	countries are neces - sarily impervious to new ideas , inventions , and ' modernization . '

		RECENT POETRY .

		* Mr.
T. Sturge Moore	PERSON	often , to borrow a phrase of his own , `` uses speech in an arch style , '' - not to say in a manner that is frankly archaic .

		Inversions are frequent in his verse , and although the meaning is often simple , the reader must sometimes double upon his tracks to discover it .

		This , however , is only a minor mannerism of a poetic style that is full of beauty and distinction .

		There is little that is modern in Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's work , if by `` modern '' one means the representation of the externals of contemporary life , but modern feeling is recorded in richly beautiful forms .

		For the symbols of his emotions Mr.
Moore	PERSON	uses Greek stories or myths , but it is the essential inner core of the mystery rather than the outer trapping that appeals to him ; and in poems such as `` Semele , '' `` The Thigh of Zeus , '' `` A Prayer , `` or `` The Dying Swan '' the mood transcends the mode and life itself seems to supersede the vehicle of expression .

		We quote the last of these : '' O silver-throated Swan Struck , struck !

		a golden dart Clean through thy breast has gone Home to thy heart .

		Thrill , thrill , O silver throat !

		O silver trumpet , pour Love for defiance back On him who smote !

		And brim , brim o'er With love ; and ruby-dye thy track Down thy last living reach Of river , sail the golden light Enter the sun 's heart even teach , wondrous-gifted Pain , teach thou The God of love , let him learn how ! ''

		The formal beauty of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's verse is based upon close rhythmic and sound har - monies .

		It is hardly possible that he will be called upon to bear the burden of popularity , but his rare qualities will continue inevitably to attract the lover of poetry .

The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	's new book of poems , `` North of
Boston	LOCATION	, '' leaves such a strong im - pression of men and women in the mind that one is led to think of it as a new novel rather than as a book of verse .

		This is a significant fact .

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	, using verse , and without in the least forcing the idea , has conveyed an im - pression of life such as might be conveyed by Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	or Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	in prose .

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's first book of verse , `` A Boy 's Will , ' ' was a volume of lyrics , fanciful , inventive , and with a certain whimsical twist , yet with very little of this more substantial quality .

		The sparse
New England	LOCATION	pasture with its outcropping granite boulders and the sparse
New England	LOCATION	character with its outcropping strata of close-grained , hard - headed practicality and its unexpected sunny levels of human idealism -LRB- the amazing Puri - tan compound -RRB- these are both revealed through the sympathetic , kindly , but keenly humorous vision of Mr.
Frost	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's feeling for nature is not romantic ; nor is it realistic in an external sense .

		Rather it gives us a direct sense of the earth ; that close con - nection between nature and man which is only gained by constant companionship or by that intimacy of toil in which the earth gives up only what is demanded of her .

		In cities we lose this sense of nature .

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	restores to us the direct primitive sense of the earth .

		A mountain , a field , or a wood exists for him as it exists in life .

		They are not shadowy , symbolic , or romantic shapes .

		They are real , they occupy space ; they count as much as people count , and sometimes more , in a man 's consciousness .

		Doubtless there will be many readers who will find Mr.
Frost	PERSON	dull , and who will object to his verse structure .

		There is no denying that his insistent monosyllabic monotony is irritating , but it may be ques - tioned whether any less drab monotony of rhythm would have been so successful in con - veying the particular aspect of life presented .

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	is at his finest in his subtle delinea - tion of Yankee heroics in ' ' The Code , ' ' in his whimsical humoresque , ' ' A Hundred Collars , ' ' in the drab tragedy of `` The Death of the Hired Man , '' and in the cold conflict of sun - dered temperaments revealed in the poem called `` Home Burial . ''

		All these poems are too long to quote in full , and it would only misrepresent them to quote parts of them .

		So it must be flatly asserted that in the particular field Mr.
Frost	PERSON	has chosen he is to be compared with Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	, Mr.
D. H. Lawrence	PERSON	, and Mr.
W. W. Gibson	PERSON	, the three English poets who are most eager in the attempt to express the gesture and the feeling of everyday life in something other than ' ' the grand style . ' '

		Mrs.
Dora Sigerson Shorter	PERSON	has a delicate lyric gift and her work always impresses the reader with the graceful spontaneity of one who sings to please herself , and , incidentally , others .

		Her latest small book , ``
Madge Linsey	PERSON	, and Other Poems , '' contains the ballad of the title and several shorter poems and lyrics .

		Perhaps the most charming of these is `` Build No Roof Tree Over Thee '' or `` The Little Bells of
Sevilla	LOCATION	, '' with its suggestive air : '' The ladies of
Sevilla	LOCATION	go forth to take the air , They loop their lace mantillas , a red rose in the hair ; Upon the road Delicias their little horses run , And tinkle , tinkle , tinkle , the bells go every one .

		Beside the
Guadalquivir	LOCATION	, by orange-scented way , The ladies of Sevilla they come at cool of day ; They wave their fans coquettish , their black eyes gleam and glow , And all their little carriage bells a-jingle , jingle go . ''

		Any one who has ever been in
Seville	LOCATION	will recognize the truth of the impression .

		Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	, who is only twenty-one , and who has been `` a farm-hand , driver , tramp , harness-man , navvy , plate-layer , and wres - tler , '' has resolutely set himself to celebrate these various experiences in verse .

		But he has not proved himself as skilful in .

		wrestling with the Muse as with his fellow navvies .

		In fact in his initial poem , `` The Pick , '' he shows unmistakable symptoms of `` the dis - ease of cosmicality , '' supposed to belong ex - clusively to American poets : `` In the depths of the pluvial season it gallantly stayed to your hand , In the dead end of woe and creation , afar in the furthermost land , When the saturnine heavens hung o'er you as dark as the ultimate tomb , When the rough of the valley you gutted was filled with ineffable gloom , When down in the depths of the planet uprooting the brontosaur 's bed , With the fire-damp writhing around you , and a candle affixed to your head , When the gold-seeking fever enthralled you , when you fitfully watered the pan , Ever it strove to your bidding , ever it aided your plan , Ready , resistless , reticent , friend of the conquering man ! ''

		Further on in the same poem Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	imposes this rather difficult injunction : '' Look on your pick as a lover would gaze on the girl at his side . ''

		The ' ' Manchester Guardian ' ' cautiously states that Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	' ' has been called the greatest poet since Kipling . ''

		And then , becoming less cautious , the paper says : `` At once elo - quent and susceptible , he has the typical
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 255 poetic temperament . ''

		Unfortunately Mr.
MacGill	PERSON	's chief susceptibility is to the elo - quence of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, and we fear that a susceptibility to another 's eloquence is no more commendable than the courage of the opinions of others .

		At any rate , it does not constitute a poet .

		In Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's poems one finds the outward form of Whitman without the essen - tial kindling warmth of the inner spirit .

		At least there is a surface resemblance to Whit - man in the form , but the resemblance is only skin-deep .

		Whitman 's verse was not metric but rhythmic .

		Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's lines are neither metric nor rhythmic .

		Verse that ap - proaches prose in rhythm must at least fur - nish a rhythm as satisfying to the ear as good prose .

		Chopping phrases or sentences into lines , with abrupt pauses and monotonous antitheses , does not make good verse or good prose .

		Throughout the book one is con - scious that Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	comes danger - ously near to re-writing Whitman in certain passages .

		But of course one realizes that any prophet must be constantly paraphrased , and it is not to this that one objects so much as to the hardening of the spirit of revolt into platitude .

		The poem entitled `` The Slave , '' for instance , is undoubtedly true philosophy but it leaves one cold : '' They set the slave free , striking off his chain ... Then he was as much of a slave as ever .

		He was chained to servility , He was still manacled to indolence and sloth , He was still bound by fear and superstition , By ignorance , suspicion , and savagery ... His slavery was not in the chains , But in himself ... They only set free men free ... And there is no need of that : Free men set themselves free . ''

		Possibly it is the sensuous appeal that one misses in Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	.

		His expression rarely exceeds statement , and statement may , as we have said , present correctly the modern intellectual attitude of revolt while failing utterly to arouse .


ALICE C. HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		Colonel Vachee 's book on ''
Napoleon	PERSON	at Work , '' originally written with the object of preparing military students for those '' battles of the future '' which are now of the present , is being translated into English by Mr.
G. Frederic Lees	PERSON	.

		It empha - sizes the supreme importance of the personal element in military leadership , arguing that though
Napoleon	PERSON	carried his centralization to excess , nothing can replace the commander-in-chief who is able at the decisive moment to assume sole authority over his forces .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* Popularity is mostly a mystery .

		Publishers speak dogmatically about `` what will go and what wo n't , '' only to admit that the longer they study the problem the more puzzled they are .

		Writers , except those who have a large and faithful audience , generally assert that the public 's demand is utterly irrational .

		Readers are seldom able satisfactorily to ac - count for so much as their own - individual preferences .

		Reviewers are notoriously help - less to prophesy , however alert they may be to explain , a novel 's popularity .

		The diffi - culty may lie partly in the fact that there are novel-reading publics rather than a novel - reading public .

		Mr.
George Barr McCutcheon	PERSON	and Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	are both popular novelists , but it may be that very few persons read them both .

		It is possible that what alienates one numerous sort of reader is the thing that delights another numerous sort .

		The reasons given why a particular novel will not succeed might be altogether valid for the particular public which the reasoner had in mind and not at all valid for another public which it had not occurred to him to consider .

		Mr.
Coningsby Dawson	PERSON	has apparently put something for almost everybody into `` The Raft . ''

		It starts off with a discussion be - tween two young women of their helpless need of men to marry , as if that were to be the theme of the book .

		Serious-minded readers , who like to feel that they are getting some - thing over and above mere amusement for their time , and reviewers , who are aware how much easier it is to discuss a novel that is based on an idea than one that is not , are pleased to discover these sentences : '' ' We 're two girls adrift on a raft and we ca n't swim .

		Over there 's the land of marriage , with all the little children , the homes , and the husbands ; we 've no means of getting to it .

		Unless some of the men see us and put off in boats to our rescue , we 'll be caught in the current of the years and swept out into the hunger of mid-ocean .

		But they 're too busy to notice us .

		Oh , dear ! ' ''

		Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately , as long as serious-minded readers and reviewers are so small a public Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	did not choose to elaborate this conception .

		He had too many other things on his mind .

		He had Illustrated .

		256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	thirty or forty characters to present , a num - ber of love stories to tell , and much tender observation of the human desire for goodness to record .

		Sometimes , as in the first part of `` The Raft , '' Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	affects the contem - porary realistic manner ; sometimes , and much more often , he writes in the whimsical vein of certain stories told for children ; and he never misses an opportunity to inject the wistfully sentimental flavor .

		There is no doubt that Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	has read
Dickens	PERSON	, obvious as are his dissimilarities to that master of a special convention , and no doubt that his novels are an expression of his own temperament .

		But his eye is a misty one .

		In ``
Saturday	DATE	's Child , '' Mrs.
Kathleen Norris	PERSON	has written a thoroughly American story of an exceptional young woman who achieved a husband , children , and a home in spite of poverty , and in spite of the tempta - tion offered by riches .


Susan Brown	PERSON	is intro - duced to us as a thirty dollar a month clerk in
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		She was lazy but am - bitious , eager but uncertain .

		She wanted to do something ; she did not know what .

		A distinguished novelist offered himself and she would have become his mistress but for an accident that made her miss the boat on which she was going away with him .

		In the end she found a sincere man , a labor leader , whom she deeply loved and who loved her .

		We in
America	LOCATION	like our heroines to be like that , do we not ?

		Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	makes no at - tempt at fine writing , but presents a wealth of observed detail , homely , recognizable , and usually interesting .

		There is too much of it ; a more finished artist would have done better with less ; but Mrs.
Norris	PERSON	has made a sub - stantial fabric background of it .

		And if the whole is a little overcharged with sentiment and morality , it is not really mawkish .

		Mrs.
Josephine Daskam Bacon	PERSON	is a skilled journalist , observant of the day 's tendency and prepared to discuss it .

		She has designed `` To-Day 's Daughter '' to illustrate the `` prob - lem ' ' of the contemporary middle-class woman who spends a large income and who is not content to be wife and mother , mistress and friend to her husband .

		The volume presents a number of variations on the type , each of whit3h would stand by itself as a short story but for the Dr.
Fanchon	PERSON	who serves as deus ex machina in all of them .

		One example is the woman who neglects her husband for a dozen reformist activities , only to discover that her real happiness is to be achieved by living as his squaw under the most primitive conditions .

		Another is a woman whose suc - cess as an interior decorator is hollow because she and her husband are estranged .

		A third is a woman whose vogue as a portrait painter is sufficient to enable her to pay all her share of keeping up several establishments and the expenses of the children besides , so that her husband has not the slightest claim upon her .

		Most of the cases are argued out easily and sensibly by Dr.
Fanchon	PERSON	.

		He is master of every situation except the last of the three mentioned , and even that he partly dominates by reason of an eloquent lecture on the pri - mary social importance of preserving the fam - ily .

		The chief objection to Mrs.
Bacon	PERSON	's stories is that they are too readily resolved by a formula .

		Some of her simplification of the issues involved is in the interests of space rather than in the interests of illumination .

		A whole volume is not too much to devote to a single instance of the sort which interests her .

		And to have done the thing more by the method of the novelist and less by that of the pamphleteer would have made her moral the more convincing for being the less insisted upon .

		It is easy enough to see what string Miss
Marjorie Ben ton Cooke	PERSON	's `` Bambi '' is meant to pull .

		It is no plea for the sex , but a bare - faced glorification of it .

		Bambi is only nine - teen when she marries , against his will , a romantic young idealist of a playwright in order to take care of him , make a success of him , and teach him to love her .

		Bambi 's capacity easily enables her to support her husband and to re-create him at the same time .

		She dashes off a story that wins a prize and an order to do a series for a magazine .


Jarvis	PERSON	struggles heroically to bring forth a play which Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	will have none of .

		Bambi per - suades Mr.

Jarvis	PERSON	is sufficiently humiliated to learn his trade ,
Bambi	ORGANIZATION	accepts him as her consort .

		The story is brightly written in the briefest of paragraphs , with an eye to such contemporary events as Mr.
Richard Bennett	PERSON	's recent tour with `` Damaged Goods '' and a reckless freedom in the use of actual celeb - rities for a background .

		But would a play - wright so high-vaulting as to think Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	of no consequence , Sir
James Barrie	PERSON	a questionable success in the theatre , and Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	a `` pamphleteer '' actually make Mr.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 257 Mr.
A. S. M. Hutchinson	PERSON	has been greeted in some quarters as a romancer of at least the .

		second order .

		He is a painstaking writer .

		The agony of Mr.
Puddlebox	PERSON	on the day he gave himself to the sea in order that Mr.
Wriford	PERSON	might be saved is built up through thirty pages with a rhythmic beat that few of Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	's rivals could sustain .

		But some newspaper reporters could produce a more poignant effect in a column .

		That is the trouble with making too much of mere writing .

		But Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	's method would be of comparatively little consequence if the material on which he exercises it were sound .

		In the case of `` The Clean Heart '' it is not sound .

		It is the agony that Mr.
Hutchinson	PERSON	is after , and agony that he insists upon .

		If he were less eager to squeeze the last possible tear from his situations he might perceive their essential falsity , and construct better ones .

		As it is , his architecture runs to deco - ration .

		He may very well please the naivete which welcomed the jig-saw , but he is merci - lessly exposed to the slightest sophistication .

		Miss
Ethel Sidgwick	PERSON	is sophisticated to the last degree , and yet she is an artist .

		Occasion - ally , as in `` A Lady of Leisure , '' she takes delight in her own virtuosity , an amusing but inevitably a stultifying game .

		Much of her dialogue demands a degree of attention if the results of her skilful indirection are not to be lost which few readers are likely to give it .

		But when
Miss Sidgwick	ORGANIZATION	's interest in her people takes hold of her , as it did in most of `` Promise '' and `` Succession , '' and does in many passages of her present novel , she is a guide as well as a virtuoso .

		There is one passage in which a woman of the world is revealed , a passage in which exposition and analysis and narrative are so happily blended that the eye marches up and down her pages while the mind is satisfied .

		And just as the woman is taking shape as an extraordinarily competent person ,
Miss Sidgwick	PERSON	introduces the daughter Violet , and in a casual clause delivers the final stroke : '' Violet on her side did not despise her mother , unless in passing flashes , when her father was badly worried : but from the age of ten years she had despised her tranquilly . ''

		We have not been quite ready to despise
Eveleen	PERSON	, but immediately and without a pause we accept
Violet	ORGANIZATION	's verdict , which is precisely what Miss Sidgwick wishes us to do .

		`` A Lady of Leisure '' is a novel to interest the connois - seur of novels .

		But in the end he will vote it , in studio slang , `` amusing . ''

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Education in its largest sense .

		Dr.
C. Hanford Henderson	PERSON	's book , `` What Is It to Be Edu - ^ ^ cated ? ''

		-LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , is put forth as a sort of sequel to his widely read and whole - somely stimulating work , `` Education and the Larger Life , '' but at the same time as an independent utterance sufficiently complete in itself to render unnecessary for its full under - standing any previous study of the antecedent volume .

		Elaboration and addition , rather than continuation , make up the substance of the later work , and show the writer 's thought to have expanded and developed w r ith the dozen years separating the two books .

		How thor - oughly devoted to his chosen profession the author is may be gathered even from hap - hazard perusal of its pages , but particularly from such passages as the following extract from his preface : `` In the long vacation , when my boys have all left me , and I sit alone before my big fireplace , brooding , I find myself keen to push aside the intervening months , to have it term-time once more , to start afresh , to do the thing infinitely better than I have just succeeded in doing it . ''

		The reason of this hope and expectation of doing the thing always better and better is that the teacher is forever continuing and never completing his own edu - cation , and his ability as a teacher keeps pace with his docility as a learner .

		A wide range of topics relating to culture in the largest sense , as well as to the pedagogical problem , will be found in the book 's agreeably rambling chapters .

		Even subjects so seemingly remote from the matter in hand as the influence of railroads on our civilization , some aspects of the servant problem , the desirability of wear - ing only such garments as can go frequently into the washtub , and the nightmare of race - suicide , are either cursorily or in some detail brought under discussion .

		Thus he will be a difficult person who can not find something to engage his attention in the book .

		It is to be noted , by the way , that the author is no en - thusiast for the ancient classics as educational studies .

		He would allow their election in col - lege , but believes that until then other more important branches should have the prece - dence .

		And yet that very faultiness in the use of English which he notes in American boys is often most effectively and expeditiously corrected by imparting some knowledge of fun - damental language principles through a little study of a highly inflected tongue like Latin or Greek .

		Something of the spirit of this ad - mirable book of Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's may be caught from the few lines with which this brief notice must content itself to come to a 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	close .

		In a chapter headed `` Live Your Own Life '' he says , felicitously : `` At twenty-one a man is not educated , however intelligently he has been brought up .

		At best , he is only educated up to twenty-one .

		And he is not even educated up to that age , unless he has been taught to see that this revelation of the moral and aesthetic universe which constitutes edu - cation , this unfolding and perfecting of the human spirit , is in reality a life-long adventure upon which he is consciously to enter , with a stout and merry heart . ''

		And in these few words we learn what it is to be educated , or , better , what it is to be undergoing education ; for true education is never static and finished .

		The biographies F .

		or ih ^ P 88 * two centuries the of two kings of
England	LOCATION	have been men kin 8 - of only moderate abilities , and the influence of kingship in the state has been steadily declining .

		Since
William III	PERSON	.

		En - gland has had no great monarch ; not even Queen
Victoria	PERSON	with all her many virtues as a woman could lay any claim to real greatness in statesmanship .

		But during the long history of the English nation , many strong rulers have borne the crown ; and kingship at one time was the greatest force in the government .

		It is significant that in this age of democratic growth an effort is being made to form a new estimate of the royal institution ; in a series of biographies entitled `` The Kings and Queens of
England	LOCATION	, '' edited by Mr.
Robert S. Rait	PERSON	and Mr.
William Page	PERSON	, we are to be told of what royalty has contributed to the great - ness of
England	LOCATION	, or , as Professor
Shotwell	PERSON	puts it in his suggestive Introduction to the series , of `` royalty at work rather than on display . ''

		Two volumes have thus far ap - peared : a biography of
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		by Mr.
L. F. Salzmann	PERSON	and one of
Henry VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		by Miss
Gladys Temperley	PERSON	.

		There is little originality in Mr.
Salzmann	PERSON	's work ; the early
Angevin	PERSON	period has been tilled industriously by some of the most capable English historians and the reign of
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		has been previously studied almost exclusively from the viewpoint of the new series , for
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		was almost con - stantly at work and very rarely on display .

		The author has , however , produced a very readable account of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's life and activi - ties and an excellent summary of the results of his reign .

		It is the sort of book that stu - dents of English mediaeval history have long felt the need of , as the only complete biograph - ical study of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's life earlier published is Mrs.
Green	PERSON	's little book in the `` Twelve English Statesmen '' series .

		In her study of the reign of
Henry VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Temperley	PERSON	has had a greater opportunity and has conse - A doctor 's literary diversions .

		quently been able to produce a more important biography .

		The facts of
Henry VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		's reign have long been known , but they have not always been perfectly understood , and the king 's character has surely not been appreci - ated as it should be .

		The most important chap - ter of Miss
Temperley	PERSON	's book is the closing one , in which she discusses
Henry VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		's per - sonality and the importance of his reign . ' '

		He was no sinister , savage despot , with no mind above the tortuous tricks of a suspicious tyranny , but a gracious , liberal-minded mon - arch , with a marked taste for splendour and pageantry , a more or less conscious imitator of the methods of the Italian despots . ''

		An important feature of both volumes is an `` Itinerary , '' which traces the travels of each king and shows where he was on important dates , as far as the sources enable us to deter - mine his movements .

		This is of special im - portance for the reign of so restless a mon - arch as
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		Both volumes are provided with illustrations , chiefly portraits for the later work and pictures of material remains for the earlier .

		-LRB-
Hough ton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The essay , reflective , rambling , reminiscent , and often packed with much genial philosophy and rich in the wisdom that comes of a con - siderable experience of human nature in its manifold types , has ever been the form of lit - erature in which the physician with a leaning to letters has shown himself most inclined to give written expression to his thoughts .

		To - the company of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	, Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	,
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	,
Samuel Smiles	PERSON	, and other medical men who have sought diversion from professional cares in the writing of books not too taxing either to author or to reader , or who have in the end turned this agreeable avocation into a vocation , Dr.
A. Stuart M. Chisholm	PERSON	knocks for admittance in his substantial volume of collected articles and addresses entitled `` Recreations of a Physician '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		He writes on spe - cialization , physicians as men of letters , Shake - speare 's Banquo , the symbolism of names , royal authors , the inherent spirit of medicine , some translations of
Horace	PERSON	-LRB- to which he adds two graceful ones of his own making -RRB- , some features of seventeenth-century medicine , the picaro in fiction , and the prevention of dis - ease .

		It will be seen from these headings that he has not entirely renounced the doctor in assuming the author .

		Perhaps his present stage is that of the literary essayist in evolu - tion .

		At any rate , he writes in a manner to interest both the practitioner of medicine and the student of literature .

		Wide reading and scholarly reflection upon what he has read
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 259 show themselves in his chapters ; but he allows himself more space than the best judgment might dictate in certain themes lacking the element of novelty or importance to justify this indulgence .

		For instance , in discussing the symbolism of names he makes the famous confusion of '' Undecemilla '' with `` undecim millia , '' in the St.
Ursula	PERSON	legend , an occasion for rehearsing the story of this saint and of the curious linguistic blunder on which it is supposed to be founded .

		In another essay he is perhaps not careful enough in his quotation when he says of Themistocles that he `` seemed a little to disparage that softness of mind that is imparted by the study of the finer arts when he said disdainfully , ` that he could not play on the fiddle , but that he could make a small town a large city . ' '

		Plutarch 's report of this utterance is , in
Langhorne	LOCATION	's translation : '' Tis true I never learned how to tune a harp or play upon a lute , but I know how to raise a small and inconsiderable city to glory and greatness . ''

		Mentioning certain modern doc - tors of medicine who have contributed to litera - ture , Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	,
John Brown	PERSON	,
William H. Drummond	PERSON	,
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, Dr.
Virchow	PERSON	,
J. G. Holland	PERSON	,
Clemenceau	LOCATION	, and Sir
Conan Doyle	PERSON	, the author allows `` especial magni - tude '' to
Holmes	PERSON	alone .

		These studies -LRB- for they are rather studies than essays in anything like the Elian sense -RRB- show their author to be a man of varied interests and scholarly tastes .

		s through Mr -
Russell Richardson	PERSON	's `` Eu - war-expectant rope from a Motor Car -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- describes an American motorist 's tour in a German car from
Berlin	LOCATION	through parts of
Germany	LOCATION	, Aus - tria ,
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and a few miles into
Spain	LOCATION	, apparently in the
summer of 1913	DATE	.

		Much of the present significance of the observant tour - ist 's unusually readable narrative lies in the frequent comment on the military prepara - tions and the expectancy of war which he noticed everywhere on his journey .

		The mix - ture of conservatism and sentiment that has retained for the French soldier the glaringly conspicuous uniform that now makes him an unnecessarily prominent target , is noted .

		But in time of peace the bright hues are pleasing .

		`` This constant coming and going of the French soldiers gives much color and anima - tion to the street scenes .

		Everyone is im - pressed by the cuirassiers .

		They are powerfully built and look so effective , like real soldiers ' who could uphold the traditions of
Napoleon	PERSON	's time , and who would feel much more at home on the battle-field than at an afternoon tea . ''

		Rural
France	LOCATION	, conservative and slow , is re - garded by the author as voicing with no excess of vehemence the prevalent anti-German sen - timent .

		`` No feature of our long tour through
France	LOCATION	was more instructive than this oppor - tunity to study at first hand the influences at work to widen the gulf between the two na - tions .

		We conversed with soldiers , officers , peasants in the fields , and casual French ac - quaintances whom we met in the cafes and hotels .

		Everyone admitted the gravity of the situation , and said that nothing short of the actual shadow of German invasion could have induced
France	LOCATION	to submit to the tremendous sacrifices incident to the large increase of the army . ''

		A part of Mr.
Richardson	PERSON	's tour nearly coincided with a part of President
Pom	PERSON	- care 's last year 's motor journey through the provinces , and the author says : ' '
France	LOCATION	has found her leader , a man of vast energy who understands his country 's problems and is peculiarly fitted to solve them .

		His motor tour through the provinces was like a trium - phal march .

		Everywhere he preached that gospel of unity which is the great need of the hour . ' '

		But the thrill of imminent war is not the book 's only attraction .

		Description and observation of more than average interest are spiced with motor perils -LRB- as in the
Stelvio Pass	LOCATION	-RRB- , a sufficient account of the Spanish na - tional amusement as witnesed at
San Sebas	LOCATION	- tian , and other topics that dispel somnolence .

		The motor-author might perhaps do well to use some such term as odometer -LRB- journey - measurer -RRB- instead of speedometer for the in - strument recording , not the rate of progress , but the distance travelled .

		Many good pic - tures , of
Underwood & Underwood	ORGANIZATION	origin , and a handy map -LRB- in duplicate , on both end-leaves -RRB- accompany the narrative .

		It is a fact replete with meaning A history that the histories of the more im - of
Princeton	LOCATION	.

		.

		, - , portant American colleges and universities are just now beginning to be written .

		Great schools of learning are made by men , and , as is the case with men , their stories should be told as soon as they have accomplished something that is unique and enduring .

		Mr.
Varnum Lansing Collins	PERSON	's `` Princeton '' -LRB-
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be read , therefore , with much profit , not only by Princeton graduates but by many others because of the prominent role that this insti - tution has played in the history of this coun - try ; and it will be read with pleasure , for Mr.
Collins	PERSON	has told the story of his Alma Mater without the slightest taint of the chauvinist or the malcontent , and with an unwavering adherence to the human side of his theme .

		It is a rare specimen of objective narration , for affectionate attachment to an institution of 260 THE DIAL I
Oct. 1	DATE	learning does not exactly favor this sort of writing .

		The story of
Princeton	LOCATION	has already been told , but only in a rather documentary fashion ; and histories of living institutions have always to be brought down to the present .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	has done this with brief discussion of the administrations of Presidents
Patton	PERSON	,
Wilson	PERSON	, and
Hibben	PERSON	.

		The periods around which he groups the history of
Princeton	LOCATION	are the Colonial -LRB- 1746-68 -RRB- , the Revolutionary -LRB- 1768-94 -RRB- , the ante-Bellum -LRB- 1794-1868 -RRB- , the Transition -LRB- 1868-88 -RRB- , and the Modern -LRB-
1888	DATE	- -RRB- .

		Of these , the first three are the most interest - ing .

		How Princetonians must rejoice to read of those days of humble beginnings that were to grow into great things as the result of the labors of a few men actuated by the motives that
spring	DATE	from religious conviction , political foresight , and interests that necessitate sac - rifice !

		And how
New Haven	LOCATION	men must rejoice to read that , so far as early presidents and trustees are concerned ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	is the mother of
Princeton	LOCATION	!

		A number of facts more curious than important will attract the reader 's atten - tion in passing ; for instance , the odd regula - tion that a student ' ' may absent himself from class exercises forty-nine times in two con - secutive terms , '' and the opening of the uni - versity 's ledger with the statement that each student costs the university three hundred and
thirty-one dollars	MONEY	and
fifty cents	MONEY	more than it receives from him .

		Little mention is made of the purely intellectual attainments and achievements of the
Princeton	LOCATION	graduates .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	undoubtedly thought , in this connec - tion , that items of this sort can be better cared for in catalogues , bibliographies , records of learned societies , and so on .

		Be that as it may , their inclusion would have added but little to his delightful volume , so excellently written and so abounding in touches of human appeal to many without the gates of
Old Nassau	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Stanley C. Johnson	PERSON	's `` His - ^ SthAmSa .

		tor - v of Emigration from the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	to North Amer - ica , 1763-1912 , '' is a thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of doctor of science in the
University of London	ORGANIZATION	and published in a series of mono - graphs edited by the Director of
the London School of Economics and Political Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a very satisfactory piece of work .

		The author has conceived his subject broadly and has used his materials with diligence and dis - crimination .

		An introductory chapter sums up such meagre information as can be had concerning English , Scottish , and Irish emi - gration to
America	LOCATION	between the close of the Seven Years ' War and the restoration of peace in
1815	DATE	.

		This is followed by a brief historical survey -LRB- which , happily , is not over - loaded with statistics -RRB- covering the period 1815-1912 .

		Nine-tenths of the volume , how - ever , is descriptive rather than narrative .

		Subjects to which ample consideration is ac - corded include the causes of emigration , as - sisted emigration , the restriction of emigra - tion , the transportation and distribution of emigrants , the land systems encountered by emigrants in
America	LOCATION	, past and present schemes of colonization , the emigration of women and children , and the economic and social effects of emigration .

		The volume closes with a statistical appendix and a full and val - uable bibliography .

		The emigration which is brought under survey is principally that from
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	to the present British dependencies in the new world .

		But the phenomena considered are largely such as are exhibited no less by emigration to Aus - tralia ,
South Africa	LOCATION	, and other lands , so that the book becomes virtually a study of British and Irish emigration in general .

		In our day approximately three hundred thousand men .

		women , and children go out each year from the
United Kingdom	LOCATION	to settle in distant por - tions of the world .

		In health and capacity for labor they are rather above than below the average .

		The question which inevitably comes is whether
Great Britain	LOCATION	can afford to lose , in ever-growing numbers , these pro- ductive elements of her population .

		The con - clusion reached by the author seems to be that the effects of the drain can be withstood successfully , provided , first , that the outflow shall not exceed the natural increase , at home , of births over deaths ; second , that those who migrate shall settle principally in
Canada	LOCATION	.


Australia	LOCATION	, and other British dependencies ; and , third , that these dependencies shall agree definitely to assist the mother country in bearing the burden of
Imperial Defence	ORGANIZATION	.

		Con - temporary developments indicate that the last-mentioned of these conditions , at least , is assured of fulfilment .

		Delightfully characteristic of Italian mercantile methods are the incidents related in connection with the purchase of cabinets and majolica and other useful or decorative articles for the villa 's interior .

		Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	is evidently no novice in the subtleties of Italian commerce .

		As a whole , his book is a most agreeable blending of the poetic , the imag - inative , and the romantic-historic , on the one hand , with the practical , the domestic , the homely and pleasantly realistic , on the other .

		Until European travel conditions improve , one ought to find in Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's chapters some measure of solace for the necessity of fore - going a visit to the country he knows so well and writes of so entertainingly .

		Recently , how - ever , Count Ltitzow , the biographer of
John IIuss	PERSON	, has made the Hussite Wars the subject of extensive and thorough research , and has come to believe that the conventional ideas concern - ing this movement are largely based on error .

		Though Count Liitzow grants that the move - ment had an important religious phase , he presents it in `` The Hussite Wars '' -LRB- Button -RRB- chiefly as a national Bohemian movement .

		It is the nationalist Slav rather than the re - ligious zealot that the author believes to be im - portant .

		Count Liitzow 's work will no doubt find a welcome among students of fifteenth century history ; but it is not likely that his conclusions will be given immediate accep - tance , as the whole work is somewhat contro - versial in character .

		The subject matter is of great interest , but the author 's style is heavy and his treatment of the facts is often so detailed as to be obscure and confusing .

		Selected mainly from her five pre - vious volumes , they show her delicate talent at its best .

		Nearly all of them , even those dealing with literary subjects , express the author 's feeling for nature in one way or another , so that while her topics are sometimes as widely separated from each other as '' Rushes and Reeds '' and `` A Point of Biography '' and her method is the discursive one , a common emotion unites her volume .

		Into the Out - lines have been crowded many bits of information regarding works written during the reign of Queen

		Although the authors are conscientious in their learning , they are unfortunately wanting in any instinctive or ardent sympathy with creative genius .

GERMANY	LOCATION	'S SWELLED HEAD By
Emil Reich	PERSON	Late Professor of International Law at
the University of Vienna	ORGANIZATION	The purpose of this book by the late Dr.
Reich	PERSON	, the celebrated historian and eminent authority on international law , is to bring to the attention of English-speaking people what the author affirms , and recent events show , is the fixed belief of numberless Germans namely , that
Germany	LOCATION	is the predestined head and master of the human race .

		Dr.
Reich	PERSON	brings ample evidence to prove that this belief has long been fostered and developed by the teachings of German university professors , by lectures to the public , and by pamphlets and books which have had a tremendous circulation .

		The theory in its baldest form attempts to prove that most great movements in the world 's history during the last two thousand years are of Teutonic origin ; and that a vast preponderance of the world 's great men during the same period were , if the truth were known , of Teutonic origin .

		As one of the deep-seated causes for
Germany	LOCATION	's vast political and military ambitions , this phase is well worth the careful attention of the American reader .

Reich	PERSON	's describes clearly , cogently , and with a wealth of startling detail , a state of affairs which will strike most of us with the force of an astounding revelation .

		One of the secrets of Dr.
Miller	PERSON	's wonderful ability to touch and mold the lives of people thousands of whom he never saw was his passion for letter writing .

		He was called a Christian Knight of the Golden Pen , because of the marvellous letters of helpfulness , one or more of which were written nearly every day for a generation .

		Many of those who are privileged to read these letters will feel that a personal message is coming to them , and pupils in life 's school will gladly note the strengthening words of him who learned the secret of helpfulness from the Friend who was his constant companion .

		VACHEL LINDSAY .

		Mr.
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	is surely the most curi - ous literary figure in
America	LOCATION	.

		His poems have appeared alike in `` Farm and Fireside '' and ' ' The
Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		He has proclaimed himself at one time or another a tramp , an apostle of beauty , and an artist of `` the Higher Vaudeville . ' '

		He might have added that he is something of a '' gospel-shouter . ' '


Chicago	LOCATION	's interest in Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	was defi - nitely aroused
last winter	DATE	at the dinner given by `` Poetry '' in honor of Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	.

		It was Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	himself who was re - sponsible .

		He intimated that Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	was the most promising poet he had discovered in the
United States	LOCATION	and flatly stated of `` Gen - eral
William Booth	PERSON	Enters into Heaven '' that it had ' ' an earnest simplicity , a strange beauty , and you know
Bacon	PERSON	said , ` there is no excel - lent beauty without strangeness . ' ' '

		Mr.
Lind	PERSON	- say was persuaded , when he had acknowledged this compliment , to read a new poem , `` The Congo . ''

		The moment was not propitious .

		The audience was already thinking how it could manage decently to go home .

		But Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's first line caught its flagging atten - tion : '' Fat black bucks in a wine-barrel room , Barrel-house kings , with feet unstable , Sagged and reeled and pounded on the table , Pounded on the table , Beat an empty barrel with the handle of a broom , Hard as they were able , Boom , boom , BOOM , With a silk umbrella and the handle of a broom ,
Boomlay	LOCATION	, boomlay , boomlay , BOOM .

		Those who had never heard Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	be - fore , and they were in the majority , were a little excited and a good deal puzzled .

		Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	chanted four lines more , '' THEN I had religion , THEN I had a vision .

		I could not turn from their revel in derision .

		THEN I SAW THE
CONGO	LOCATION	, CREEPING THROUGH THE BLACK , CUTTING THROUGH THE FOREST WITH A GOLDEN TRACK . ''

		and then , marking the rapid , syncopated rhythm with swaying body and jerking arms , he beat up his first climax in the fashion com - mon to exhorters of every sort : 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	'' Then along that riverbank A thousand miles Tattooed cannibals danced in files ; Then I heard the boom of the blood-lust song And a thigh-bone beating on a tin-pan gong .

		And ' BLOOD ' screamed the whistles and the fifes of the warriors ; ' BLOOD ! '

		screamed the skull-faced , lean witch - doctors , ' Whirl ye the deadly voo-doo rattle , Harry the uplands .

		Steal all the cattle , Rattle-rattle , rattle-rattle , Bing .

		Boomlay , boomlay , boomlay , BOOM . ' ''

		That `` BOOM '' shook the room , but Mr.
Lind	PERSON	- say chanted on , chanted of Mumbo - Jumbo , and all the other gods of the
Congo	LOCATION	, of the negro fairyland , of
Jacob	PERSON	and the golden stairs , until : '' There , where the wild ghost-gods had wailed A million boats of the angels sailed With oars of silver , and prows of blue And silken pennants that the sun shone through .

		'T was a land transfigured , 't was a new creation .

		Oh , a singing wind swept the negro nation And on through the backwoods clearing flew : ' Mumbo - Jumbo is dead in the jungle .

		Never again will he hoo-doo you .

		Never again will he hoo-doo you . ' ''

		When Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	had finished , he was surrounded by women who wished to be his hostesses at dinner .

		The North Shore had dis - covered a lion who could roar !

		The young man who had come up to
Chicago	LOCATION	to stay three days remained three weeks .

		It is altogether possible that such a triumph means only that those who give dinners to Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	are quite as susceptible to the devices of vaudeville as are those who do not .

		But hap - pening in
Chicago	LOCATION	, as it did , it lends interest to the question which Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	, in introducing ' ' The
Congo	ORGANIZATION	' ' and the other poems of Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's new volume , asks : how far does Mr.
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	express the
Middle West ?	LOCATION

		Miss
Monroe	PERSON	leaves the question to time to decide , as must all those who feel that the
Middle West	LOCATION	is still very much a place and very little a philosophy or an emotion .

		Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	is not of that opinion .

		He feels that the people of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley can be ' ' expressed . ' '

		He thinks of their spirit as the spirit of
New England	LOCATION	once removed and of their culture as the culture of
Harvard	LOCATION	, ' ' The Atlantic Monthly , '' and , say , the
Congrega	PERSON	- tional Church , modified only by a somewhat freer manner and gesture .

		The Middle West Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	knows best might be better rep - resented by a state university , ' ' The Outlook , ' ' and Methodism , but that substitution would probably exaggerate the difference , in Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's mind , between it and
New England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's own statement may be found in one of his proclamations in `` Farm and Fire - side , '' or perhaps better , in his apostrophe to
Kansas	LOCATION	in his `` Adventures while Preaching the
Gospel of Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, ' ' from which we quote : ''
Kansas	ORGANIZATION	, the
Ideal American Community	ORGANIZATION	!

		Kan - sas , nearer than any other to the kind of a land our fathers took for granted !

		Kansas , practically free from cities and industrialism , the real last refuge of the constitution , since it maintains the type of agricultural civilization the constitution had in mind !

		Kansas , State of tremendous crops and hardy , devout , natural men !

		... Kansas of the Chautauqua and the college student and the devout school-teacher !

		The dry
State	ORGANIZATION	, the automobile
State	ORGANIZATION	, the insurgent State !

		Kansas , that is ruled by the cross-roads church and the church type of civilization !

		The
Newest New England !	ORGANIZATION

		State of more promise of permanent spiritual glory than
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in her brilliant youth ! ''

		The attitude here so directly stated in prose is implicit in Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	's poems .

		He has been familiar enough with the moving-picture theatre to write verses celebrating the charms of Miss Blanche Sweet and
Miss Mary Pick	ORGANIZATION	- ford ; he has been enough affected by contem - porary sociology to write poems on the white slave and one , at least , on the proletariat ; and he has written in praise of a dancer , '' With foot like the snow , and with step like the rain . ''

		But these interests have come easily enough , without seriously modifying the man within .

		His vocabulary , his images , his rhythms , his moral bias all these go directly back to the camp-meeting which was so familiar an ex - pression of Middle Western emotion a genera - tion ago .

		We do not need to be told that Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	has lived in a house with a
summer	DATE	- kitchen in the rear , a base-burner in the middle , and furniture of black walnut and hair-cloth in the front .

		It is perfectly certain that the margin by which he became a poet and not a revivalist was of the narrowest .

		Could anything be more representative of the
Middle West	LOCATION	that was ?

		To grant Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	his representativeness does not , of course , grant him his expressive - ness .

		It may be that his escape from the ex - horter 's platform is only temporary .

		Many of his poems are spoiled by what Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	would call `` moral fervour . ''

		Many more are marred by an ill-chosen word or a badly man - aged line .

		But Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	has a novel talent , even a poetical talent .

		The man who wrote
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 283 ' ' General
William Booth	PERSON	Enters into Heaven , '' where '' The banjos rattled and the tambourines Jing-jing-jingled in the hands of
Queens	LOCATION	, '' and `` The Congo '' whether it is called `` Higher Vaudeville '' or a daring experiment has poetry in him , even if he has not per - fectly learned how to bring it out .

		Indeed , we could hardly say less of Mr.
Lindsay	PERSON	if we had seen only the first lines of his poem to
John P. Altgeld	PERSON	, which begins : '' Sleep softly ... eagle forgotten ... under the stone .

		Time has its way with you there , and the clay has its own . ''

		He may cease to grow as a poet .

		He may have gone as far as he will ever go .

		In that case he will never be held to have expressed the emo - tion of the
Middle West	LOCATION	.

		But we do not know a young man of any more promise than Mr.
Vachel Lindsay	PERSON	for the task which he seems to have set himself .

		NEW TENDENCIES IN FRENCH POETRY .

		M.
Romain Holland	PERSON	says in ''
Jean Chris	PERSON	- tophe '' that , when a Frenchman has ideas , he always wants to impress them upon others .

		It does not seem quite fair to limit this quality to Frenchmen , when the Germans are well known for their didacticism and proselytism , and no one supposes that their present resort to the fields of arms means that they have perma - nently abandoned the field of ideas .

		Nor is there any lack of the desire to convert among other nations .

		Every artistic revolution is a matching of ideas against ideas , of wits against wits .

		Every new aesthetic creed is fought for by its followers with all the dia - lectic and stylistic forces at their command .

		But the distinguishing feature of the French - man with ideas is his faculty of coining terms in which these ideas are crystallized with a fair degree of finality .

		The alertness and acumen displayed by the French in their criti - cal fencing-bouts have not been lost upon other nations .

		On the whetstone of French criticism the theorists and the critics of the world have sharpened their wits and their words .

		For , every controversy that has en - gaged the attention and the interest of those in touch with French letters has left a legacy of epithets and phrases so striking and timely , so suggestive and illuminating , that they have become valuable elements of the vocabulary of other literatures .

		In this respect , at least , French criticism is unrivalled .

		Within the last twenty-five years a score of aesthetic movements has sprung up in the ever active intellectual atmosphere of
France	LOCATION	.

		They form an appalling procession of ' ' isms . ' '

		Upon impressionism and symbolism , realism and naturalism , which the progressive young gen - eration is already likely to be classing with `` archaisms , '' has followed a long line of secessionist groups of poets , some so closely allied as to be barely distinguishable , others of striking dissimilarity , and most of them not nearly so new as their names would imply .

		For they can be reduced to the two main cur - rents that have alternately determined the direction of literary development all over the world : the one , artistic and inclining toward an art for art 's sake ; the other , social and insisting upon an art springing from and appealing to real life .

		It would not be diffi - cult to conceive them as the aesthetic formulas of the eternal conflict between the ideal and the real .

		Of this bewildering abundance of ideas and their champions , some merit more than passing mention because they are distinctly sympto - matic of the general intellectual ferment and unrest of our time .

		The revolt against con - ventions frequently recurs .


M. Albert Londres	PERSON	is the father of '' eff reneisme , '' which is a poetical protest against the measured and moderate sentiments of life and letters : he would have the poet seek a state of breathless exaltation .

		Yet the following specimen of his own poetry is in the same measured lines and symmetrical rhymes that French verse has known since the days of
Boileau	LOCATION	, nor is its emotional intensity of the degree he aspires to : '' Va , marche devant toi , jeune homme , mon pareil , Et du haut du perron ou frappe le soleil , Salue amplement cette terre .

		Puis descends les gradins que ta race a montes Cours meler ta jeunesse aux luttes des cites ,
Sois	PERSON	' puissant , ' mais plus ' solitaire . ' ''

		M.
Edmond Thiaudiere	PERSON	, the author of `` Notes d'un pessimiste , '' has the courage to face an age which had acclaimed the gospel of `` beyond good or evil '' with his ideal of ' ' bonisme , ' ' a worship of goodness which he would make the philosophy of philosophies , the religion of religions , not only in theory , but in practice .

		M.
Max Jacob	PERSON	has studied the racial ancestry of the French and dis - covered in the old Druid liturgies the origin of French poetic traditions .

		He traces the close kinship between
Druid	ORGANIZATION	mysticism and Hindu metaphysics and has constructed an aesthetic system which he calls `` druidisme . ''

		M.
Andre Billy	PERSON	seeks to express the syn - thetical features of our life by an aesthetic code under the term `` totalisme . ''

		Concerned 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	with protecting the spiritual boundaries of the nation 's culture ,
M. F. Jean-Desthieux	PERSON	's `` patriartisme '' seems to be a brother in aesthetics to political nationalism .


Signor Lenzi	PERSON	, a progressive Italian , has been preach - ing in
France	LOCATION	the doctrine of '' philopresen - taneisme . ' '

		It advocates a life of pure instinct , centering in the present moment , without forethought or afterthought .

		M.
Adrien Mithouard	PERSON	has conceived the colossal idea of `` plurisme , '' which is to convey not a succes - sion of impressions , but their collective simul - taneous manifestation .

		The theory has been promptly adopted by M. H.-M .

		Barzun , who has elaborated it into '' simultaneisme , '' and an artist is said to be applying it in his paint - ings , which are to inaugurate the new school of `` synchronisme . ''

		Dating back to
1896	DATE	, an almost venerable age in our period of rapid transit in life as in letters , '' democratisme '' has run its course in art and art magazines ; recently , however , it developed into `` prole - tairisme . ' '

		To the nephew of
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Arthur Cravan	PERSON	, is due the credit of having applied to poetical production the philosophy of ' ' plural - isme , '' of which
M. J. H. Rosny	PERSON	the elder is a brilliant representative .

		Goethe had sung the conflict of his dual soul .

		Mr.
Cravan	PERSON	sings the disturbing manifestations of his plural soul .

		Conscious of being identical with all things , all human creatures and all ani - mals , he also desires ubiquity and wishes that he could gobble -LRB- bdfrer -RRB- all the tempting dishes on the world 's menus and that he could possess all women a monstrous capacity of imagination !

		Mr.
Cravan	PERSON	has also invented the term `` machinisme , '' which very appro - priately characterizes the mechanical and in - dustrial side of our life .

		The term has not found wide usage , however , perhaps because its rival , `` dynamisme , '' is more euphonious .

		Since M. A.-M .

		Gossez , the author of an in - tensely interesting volume of verse , entitled `` La mauvaise aventure '' -LRB- which , however , gives no inkling of his sympathy with the new poetic ideal and is an admirable achieve - ment on less heretical lines -RRB- , delivered a lec - ture on `` Le dynamisme poetique '' in
Rouen	LOCATION
four years ago	DATE	, the term has frequently ap - peared in the columns of literary magazines .

		The same year
M. Henri Guilbeaux	PERSON	, lecturing before audiences in
Germany	LOCATION	, said : '' So far poetry has been static ; now it is and should be dynamic .

		The naturalistic writers have given art realism and pleinairism ; the new writers are introducing movement and power . ''

		The arguments in favor of this new de - parture sound rather convincing .

		The new rhythm of our modern life , the shocks to which our sensibilities are daily exposed , have profoundly modified our organism .

		The eye accustomed to electric light can no longer see sunlight and color as it did before ; the ear has adjusted itself to the din and the clatter of metropolitan traffic and has become attuned to another world of consonance and disso - nance .

		Hence , in letters , art , and music , other standards are bound to impose themselves upon the critic who would keep abreast of the time in reducing these manifestations to eesthetie formulas .

		M. Guilbeaux , seeing these changes taking place throughout the world , argues that the new spirit of the time requires for its expression a new form , since the old medium can not hold the old message .

		He breaks out into this prophecy : `` A new Gothic age is on the way , an age of engineers , architects , Herculean rhapsodist ?

		a race of autochthones , athletic , continental , as
Walt Whitman	PERSON	said . ''

		The new poetry , in its verse-like rhythm , must reflect the inner rhythm , must correspond exactly to the very thrills of our thoughts and feelings .

		The language must have consistence , must be based upon a popular and technical vocabulary , and must be simple and solid like a piece of concrete work .

		The density of words is more important than their sonority .

		The style must approach that of the old heroic epic , inasmuch as this poetry is to glorify stupendous mechanical structures and the heroic mechanical activity of the present .

		The poet must forego all refinement of intellectual - ism and artistry and endeavor to be sane and simple and strong .

		Nor is this new poetry intended to be read in the solitude of the individual sanctuary or at the symposia of the initiated .

		On the contrary , rooted as it is in the real life of the real people , its appeal is primarily to the mass of the people , and it should be chanted in the manner of ancient rhapsodists before large congregations .

		Con - trary to symbolism and art for art 's sake , which have run their gamut and ended in subtle abstractions and orphic obscurities , dynamism is meant to record the rhythms of real life , to translate into verse of corre - sponding form the formidable power of the proletariat , the forces fermenting and seething in the metropolitan furnace , the daily turmoil of traffic , the fever of speculation , the hunger for success , all the longing of the great living mass of humanity .

		There seems little doubt that
Walt Whit	PERSON	- man is the spiritual father of
M. Guilbeaux	ORGANIZATION	's poetic ideal .

		The German poets quoted as dynamic are among those who hold high the memory of the great American poet .

		They are
Richard Dehmel	PERSON	,
Johannes Schlaf	PERSON	,
Arno Holz	PERSON	,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 285
Karl Henckell	PERSON	,
Alfons Paquet	PERSON	,
Wilhelm Schmidtbonn	PERSON	, and others .

		The French poets enrolled in this group are the late
Henri Franck	PERSON	,
Andre Spire	PERSON	,
Phileas Lebesgue	PERSON	,
Pierre Hamp	PERSON	,
Nicolas Beauduin	PERSON	, A.-M .

		Gossez , and the dramatist
Henri Martin Barzun	PERSON	.

		M. Guil - beaux refuses to consider futurism a `` mod - ern ' ' movement an amusing paradox because its eulogy of war is untimely !

		M. Guilbeaux 's mission was for some time until war was declared that of a literary mediator between the two countries .

		He wrote on German letters for French reviews and on French writers for German magazines .

		He recently published a very remarkable an - thology of contemporary German verse .

		M. Guilbeaux is an enthusiast and an idealist with whom every self-chosen task becomes a labor of love .

		No little feeling went into the compilation and the translation of the poems collected under the title `` Anthologie des lyriques allemands contemporains depuis Nietzsche . ''

		The book is dedicated to Guil - beaux 's friend ,
M. Leon Bazalgette	PERSON	, the biog - rapher and translator of Whitman , and to
Herr Stefan Zweig	PERSON	, the German translator and champion of
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		M. Ver - haeren himself supplies the preface and sees in the undertaking far more than a literary achievement .

		For
Guilbeaux	PERSON	is to him a rep - resentative of that new
Europe	LOCATION	which is to be built , not upon the conceptions of the past , but upon the realities of the present , and to bring close to each other nations separated by arti - ficial and fictitious barriers .

		One may be permitted to wonder how much faith in that new
Europe	LOCATION	now remains to
M. Verhaeren	ORGANIZATION	.

		M. Guilbeaux 's attitude toward modern poetry was vaguely foreshadowed in his first book of verse , '' Berlin-feuillets d'un soli - taire , '' which was published five years ago .

		Prolonged residence in the German capital , the most `` American '' of all German cities , had attuned his ear to the cacophonies of metropolitan life and adjusted his vision to the shifting scenes of the moving panorama about him .

		He began to realize their aesthetic possibilities and , watching the crowds at the `` Stettiner Bahnhof , '' wrote in his notebook : '' La gare est le temple moderne , Ou j ` adore exultant le coeur vibrant des trains ; Mon ame aime a flaner au long des quais en fievre , Ou Fame de la foule immensement tessaile ... '' Specimens from a volume of `` Hymnes et psaumes '' which he is preparing for publica - tion have from time to time appeared in print , and suggest that since the publication of his first book , he found his masters in
Whitman	LOCATION	and
M. Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		But although they may stand sponsors for his work , it distinctly re - flects an individuality which , after all , is bound to go its own way .

		In
M. Nicolas Beauduin	PERSON	, the editor of `` La Vie des Lettres , '' dynamic poetry has found another earnest champion .

		Not contented with opening the columns of his magazine to this new secession , he has made the following statement in a recent issue of `` Le Mercure de
France	LOCATION	'' : '' The dogma of impossibility , the hieratic atti - tude , the mathematical meter , the conventional rhythms , in a word , the ' static ' quality , shall be succeeded by the dynamics of motion , by dynamic aesthetics , truer than the other , because , rooted in reality , more identical with the life of things . ''

		M. Beauduin not only seconds Guilbeaux in theoretical propaganda , but applies the new aesthetic code to his own poetical production .

		His seven `` Poemes paroxystes a la gloire de
Paris	LOCATION	moderne '' are an amazing performance .

		Never before has the soul of a city been sung in accents so intense , so vibrant , so quivering and throbbing with the very nerves and pulses of living and striving millions : '' Geante Cite , debout sur 1 ` univers , Toi qui hausses au ciel vaincu ta Tour de Fer Comme un symbole de victoire ... '' The poems contain many striking images and eloquent lines , among them the following : '' Tu n'es pas celle qui sommeille , Mais 1 ` instable , la paroxyste qui fait saigner Et sans fin renouvelle Un desir imprevu Qui pousse hors du formalisme et du connu , Hors du cercle glace et neutre des routines , Vers une creation plus neuve et plus divine . ''

		If the spirit of this poetry reflects the read - ing of life which young
France	LOCATION	has evolved out of the chaos of conflicting ideas , it would augur a wonderful Gallic renaissance .

		For `` La Vie des Lettres '' is not the only maga - zine that sounds this new note in philosophy , letters , and art .

		It has a most valiant little contemporary in `` L ` Effort Libre , '' which is edited by
Leon Bazalgette	PERSON	,
Jean Richard Bloch	PERSON	,
Andre Spire	PERSON	, and others , and covers an even wider area of vital topics .

		Quiet workers they all are , ignoring all so-called literary coteries and in turn ignored by them .

		Perhaps the new spirit that they express and the new form in which it is manifesting itself are not wholly new to those who can read the harmo - nies of the great hymn of life up and down and recognize , not only the tune soaring above , but the mighty organ-point sounding below .

		For they hear through it all the keynote of ideal democracy and trace the pedigree of the `` dynamic '' poets and their brethren the great Verhaeren included to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		AMELIA VON ENDE .

		286 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LEARNED PASTIMES OF AN EMPEROR 6X - eite in the general public an interest wholly out of proportion to their real importance .

		To see the potentates of this world engaging in pursuits that bring them for the time being down to the plane of those not born in the purple seems to exercise a peculiar fascination on the beholder .

		Diocletian , living in unos - tentatious seclusion for nine years and amus - ing himself with the cultivation of his garden , makes an intimate appeal that is not felt in contemplating the same
Diocletian	PERSON	celebrating with
Maximian	PERSON	his splendid triumph over the enemies of
Rome	LOCATION	in
Asia	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	,
Britain	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		`` I wish you would come to Sa - lona , '' he writes to his colleague from his retirement , `` and see the cabbages I have planted : you would never again mention to me the name of empire . ' '

		Mr.
Richard Norton	PERSON	, who was last year pleasantly introduced by his father -LRB- see the `` Letters '' of
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	-RRB- to a wide circle of readers in con - nection with his work as Director of the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	, and who has extended his archaeological researches to
Greece	LOCATION	as well , describes in a recent newspaper article some of the German Emperor 's holiday diversions at
Corfu	LOCATION	, where , as patron of Greek archaeology , he is causing certain important excavations to be made .

		`` It is perhaps at
Corfu	LOCATION	, '' writes Mr.
Norton	PERSON	, `` that he has shown most clearly that he enjoys the paths of pleasantness and peace .

		There , week after week , each
spring	DATE	for sev - eral years now , he has lived above the town in the villa built by the late Empress of
Austria	LOCATION	, or else in the lovely harbor on his private steamship , the
Hohenzollern	ORGANIZATION	.

		... He is accom - panied by no pomp and state , but only by a very small necessary staff and by one or more famous scholars .

		Of these the most familiar is Dorpfeld , the architect and excavator of world-wide fame .

		He probably enjoys getting up every morning by six and getting to the site of the Greek temple -LRB- where the
Kaiser	PERSON	's excavations are -RRB- by eight , but the official staff find it a trial to their devotion .

		Yet this is what the
Kaiser	PERSON	does day after day .

		He not only goes early , but he stays till six , when the workmen go home , and only takes a couple of hours out for lunch and siesta .

		His excite - ment when anything is turned up is delight - ful to see .

		Last
spring	DATE	, when a bas-relief showing an utterly unknown and unsuspected form of ancient Greek armor was found , his understanding of it was complete , and his comparisons with mediaeval armor showed great knowledge .

		When nothing much is happening , he has been seen sitting for an hour on a pile of earth , swapping stories with one of his American friends . ''

		Worthy of notice at this time is the pen picture thus drawn by one who has met familiarly the `` war lord '' of
Europe	LOCATION	and has talked with him on matters of art and archaeology of com - mon interest to the two .

		HOMERIC NODDINGS have , ever since Homer 's time , given welcome occasion to men of less than Homeric greatness to air their little stock of learning and to swell themselves up with the conceit of vast superiority to genius .

		In reading the incomparable Omar quatrains of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's shaping , a small critic might take exception to certain images and phrases , and thus tickle himself with a sense of superi - ority to the
Woodbridge	PERSON	poet and philosopher .

		For instance , in stanza sixty-seven , the famous likening of hell to `` the shadow from a soul on fire , cast on the darkness '' might cause trouble to a literal-minded reader , who would perhaps be tempted to ask : How can a fire cast a shadow on darkness ?

		An opaque object between the fire and a surface illuminated by it would cast a shadow on that surface ; but to speak of a fire as projecting its shadow on an unilluminated void is nonsense .

		Long - fellow 's image of `` footprints on the sands of time '' has excited the derision of many a prosaic soul ; for how , it is asked , can any - thing like permanence be associated with such footprints ?

		The same storm that threw the forlorn and shipwrecked brother on to those sands would obliterate the supposed impres - sions .

		How often the self-constituted critic of literary masterpieces feels himself tempted to reconstruct certain lines that distress his small soul by reason of their fancied imper - fections !

		For example , when
Browning	PERSON	, in `` Rabbi
Ben Ezra	PERSON	, '' bids us `` rejoice we are allied to that which doth provide and not partake , effect and not receive , '' the stickler for perfect antithesis is unhappy until he has substituted ' ' bestow '' f or '' effect . ' '

		And the last line of
Emerson	LOCATION	's `` Sursum Corda '' ' ' For only it can absolutely deal ' ' disturbs the serenity of him who claims to know better than the poet himself what meaning he in - tended to convey ; for the dominant idea , argues this pestilent person , is not that heaven alone is capable of absolute dealing , but that heaven deals absolutely or not at all , and hence the line should read : ' * For it can only absolutely deal . ''

		Evidently our emendator of masterpieces is an absolute person , and so here we leave him to the merited nemesis his pedantic practices are preparing for him .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL A MODIFICATION OF SHERMAN 'S DEFINITION OF WAR arrests the attention in Mr.
Simeon Strunsky	PERSON	's `` Post-Impressions . ''

		In fact the modification is so radical as to amount to a re-definition .

		To quote from the mirth-pro - voking Mr.
Strunsky	PERSON	: `` War is love .

		It is the brotherhood of man .

		Here , for instance , the races of
India	LOCATION	have been clamoring for self-government , and in vain .

		But all at once
England	ORGANIZATION	confers on her Indian subjects a privilege infinitely greater than the right of voting for aldermen and district magistrates .

		England has admitted her Indian subjects to the fundamental democracy of the rifle and the bayonet .

		But if Sikhs and Gurkhas and Turcos are good enough to fight with white men against white men , they will soon con - sider themselves good enough to vote with white men against other white men , or to vote for themselves against all white men .

		But for the time being the little races and the oppressed races must be rather put out at the vast outpouring of love that threatens to engulf them .

		It is all so sudden ; and so per - plexing .

		When the
Great White Czar	ORGANIZATION	dis - covered how close to his heart are the Jews , and Poles , and Finns , he did not stop there .

		He immediately conferred on them the priv - ilege of marching to the frontier and dying for him .

		Could love ask more ?

		You will now recognize the true grandeur of the great European conflict .

		It is the gospel of love preached on a magnificent scale .

		It has taught the monarchs not only to love their own sub - jects , but to love and cherish each other 's subjects . ' '

		And in this carnival of love lavish - ing itself in all directions we may expect ere long to see further interesting developments . ''

		In a few years , when there will be a shifting of partners and
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	are lined up against
Russia	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Austria	LOCATION	, the new combinations of Powers will be in a position to love new combinations of small races and peoples .

		So that after two or three European wars every Power will have had a chance to love and be loved by every weak and oppressed race in the two hemispheres . ''

		To the author of this excellent fooling thanks are due for a brief respite from the horrors and the nameless anxieties aroused by the titanic struggle in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		DUCK-BACK READERS , as someone has styled those non-absorbers of literary matter who emerge from the end of a volume as little conversant with its contents as when they plunged in at the beginning , seem to differ from other readers more than in a mere matter of degree , although no reader retains everything that passes under his eyes in print .

		Indiscriminate inclusiveness is characteristic of the reading of many duck-backs , and others there are who , restricting their range , read and re-read the same books with as little in - tellectual or spiritual result .

		In this class belongs the person who forms the habit of going through
Boswell	PERSON	's `` Johnson '' once a year , but is never heard to quote a word of the great man or known to display any of his wisdom .

		Would a thorough mastery of any book admit of its annual perusal in course thereafter with patience or profit ?

		Perhaps so , but certainly not for all readers , and still more certainly not for all books .

		In an article on `` Teaching English , '' in the current `` Yale Review , '' Professor
Henry Seidel Canby	PERSON	shows us the non-assimilative college student , who reads without understanding and comes out of a course in the great authors by the same door wherein he went , uninstructed , un - stimulated , uninspired . ' '

		In truth , ' ' confesses the writer , '' it is depressing to sit in a recita - tion room , estimating , while someone recites , and your voice is resting , the volume and the flow of the stream of literary instruction washing over the undergraduates ; and then to see them bob up to the surface at the end of the hour , seemingly as impervious as when their heads went under . ''

		One of these im - pervious undergraduates is quoted as answer - ing an examination question on the character of
Justice Shallow	ORGANIZATION	in this wise : `` Justice Shallow seems to be a jolly old man who loves company , and who would do anything to please his guests . ''

		The obvious truth of the matter is that though the duck-back reader has learned to follow the printed lines from left to right , often at a high rate of speed , he has never really learned to read .

		A HOLOCAUST OF PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPTS IS one of the minor crimes to be forever sadly remembered in connection with the mon - strously greater crime of the present incred - ible European conflagration .

		The
Louvain	LOCATION	tragedy is , of course , here referred to the wanton destruction of literary treasure that is now being regretfully recalled to mind and appraised by the bibliographers and biblio - philes of all nations , but of one community of letters .

		It appears that , in addition to its priceless collection of printed works , the uni - versity library was fortunate almost from the first in possessing ancient manuscripts of great value .

		A catalogue of these published in
1641	DATE	enumerates forty-two , and more than two hun - dred others were afterward unearthed from obscure corners or otherwise added to the list .

		We read of a folio manuscript volume con - taining the chronicles of the dukes of Brabant 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16 from 1260	DATE	to
1555	DATE	; of `` Annales des Pays - Bas '' from
Pepin	LOCATION	's time to the year
1752	DATE	; of a sixteenth-century chronicle of Diest contain - ing the charter of the liberties of that city ; of the `` Fasti Academiae Louvainensis , '' giving lists of the various faculties of the university ; of a chronicle of
Utrecht	LOCATION	, in verse , of the year
1461	DATE	; and of a curious Brabantian manu - script with colored illustrations of horsemen engaged in battle .

		Also a copy of the `` Car - mina '' of Prudentius is mentioned , in small folio form and written on parchment in a style that assigns it to the
ninth century	DATE	; and there were beautiful copies of
Horace	PERSON	,
Lucan	PERSON	,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Cicero	LOCATION	, and other classical writers .

		Manuscript Bibles and liturgies and a parch - ment `` Book of Hours '' in Gothic characters of rare beauty , are further treasures that fell a prey to the flames .

		We make no mention here of the printed books that were burned , many of them irreplaceable and beyond price .

		A modern American public library is capable of rising from its ashes in a few months , re - newed in vigor ; but what resurrection can there ever be for such a library as that of
Louvain University	ORGANIZATION	?

		* CULTURE AMONG THE TAGALOGS , before the Spanish conquest , reached a degree of develop - ment seldom credited to those primitive dwellers in our far-eastern island possessions .

		Significant evidence of the persistence of that culture long after the Spaniards had taken possession of
the Philippines	LOCATION	is found in a manuscript volume lately presented to the Philippine Library by Governor-General Har - rison .

		It is a collection of land deeds and transfer contracts , and was used , with other documents , in establishing the rightful owner - ship of the friar lands some years ago .

		In the monthly `` Bulletin '' of the above-named library is printed a description of the volume , which is `` bound stoutly in carabao hide '' and is entitled : `` Libro C de las escrituras de las tierras de Bifian pertenecientes al
Colegio de Santo Tomas	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The papers it contains bear dates ranging from
1624	DATE	to
1738	DATE	.

		We learn further : `` The volume contains interesting material for study for the lawyer , as well as for the investigator of historical details con - cerning the form in which land transactions in
the Philippines	LOCATION	were made in that remote time , the manner in which declarations in respect to the same were executed , and the paper , kind of characters written , way of evi - dencing , etc. , used in former time , in this country .

		Another interesting fact in these documents is that some of them are signed in the ancient
Tagalog	LOCATION	characters , although they were executed at a time when those signing had already adopted names and titles in ac - cordance with the ideas imported into the Islands by the Spaniards .

		Nevertheless the natives continued to use those characters , even though they wrote them from left to right ... instead of writing them from top to bottom , as was formerly the custom . ''

		Dear to the most untutored savage is the language of his fathers , and dear , too , are the characters in which that language finds some sort of written expression .

		A FAMOUS `` MARK TWAIN '' CHARACTER , im - mortalized in `` Roughing It '' both in the story and in its dedication and an especial favorite of the great humorist in his
Nevada	LOCATION	mining days , died near the end of
last month	DATE	at
Greenville	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	.

		In the true `` Mark Twain '' spirit of hopeful adventure ,
Calvin H. Higbie	PERSON	, a civil engineer by profession and a miner for precious metals by circumstance and preference , had made and lost at least one considerable fortune before death over - took him .

		That he was a man capable of appreciating the peculiar genius of his gifted friend appears from the few lines he con - tributed , at Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	's re - quest , to the latter 's biography of `` Mark Twain . ''

		Describing
Sam Clemens	PERSON	's unre - strained enjoyment of the pleasures of a '' great ball '' in a newly opened pavilion at
Aurora	LOCATION	, he writes : `` In changing partners , whenever he saw a hand raised he would grasp it with great pleasure and sail off into another set , ob - livious to his surroundings .

		Sometimes he would act as though there were no use in trying to go right or to dance like other people , and with his eyes closed he would do a hoe-down or a double-shuffle all alone , talk - ing to himself and saying that he never dreamed there was so much pleasure to be obtained at a ball .

		It was all as natural as a child 's play .

		By the second set , all the ladies were falling over themselves to get him for a partner , and most of the crowd , too full of mirth to dance , were standing or sitting around , dying with laughter . ''

		To have been partner and chum to ``
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' and to have won immortality in his pages , is surely not to have lived in vain .

		THE LITERARY CRITIC 's LIMITED AUDIENCE is one not to be despised .

		Of far more influence and respectability is it than the unnumbered thousands that drive to their capacity the presses of the popular magazines .

		In Pro- fessor
Bliss Perry	ORGANIZATION	's second paper on American literary criticism , in `` The Yale Review '' for
October	DATE	, he finds occasion to say : `` Take the fact of the limited audience .

		No matter how
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 289 limited we think it is to-day , it was certainly more limited still in
1836	DATE	, when
Emerson	LOCATION	de - clared that we had no critic , and
Poe	PERSON	set him - self doggedly , month after month , in the ` Southern Literary Messenger , ' to demon - strate that there was at least one critic to be reckoned with .

		And how much this inde - fatigable advocate of the determinate prin - ciples of criticism accomplished at his lonely post !

		With better health , and better temper , and with that broader and deeper culture which was denied to him , what might not this theorist and craftsman have done for Ameri - can criticism , in spite of the small circle of subscribers to the ` Messenger , ' and in spite of the indifference of the general public !

		The American critic of to-day who can enunciate a principle or record with delicacy and beauty and absolute honesty a critical verdict for a few thousand readers in THE DIAL , ` The Nation , ' the `
Yale Eeview	PERSON	, ' need not worry about the limits of his audience .

		It is the small audience that is the vital , the respon - sive , the propagating audience . ''

		The con - scientious critic 's prayer is ever that of
Milton	PERSON	in his petition for a fit audience , though few .

		EDUCATIONAL USE OF THE PICTURE POST CARD is exemplified in the issue of these inex - pensive art products by the staid and con - servative British Museum to call popular attention to its resources , including its library .

		Necessarily it is but a few of that library 's three and one-half million volumes that can thus be advertised , but these chosen few are well worth the trouble and expense involved .

		For example , the famous
Gutenberg Bible	ORGANIZATION	is pictured for a penny to many an interested person who will be glad to take the hint and get sight of the volume itself ; a page from an early
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	is reproduced in facsimile ; the Greek fragment known as `` The Sayings of Jesus '' is similarly photo-engraved , and
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's last letter to
Lady Hamilton	LOCATION	, and the earliest map of
New York	LOCATION	, known as `` The Duke 's Plan , '' showing the topography of the town in
1661	DATE	; also the title-page to the
Shakespeare First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, and the first known map of the British Isles , from Ptolemy 's '' Cosmographia . ''

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, expert in this species of art printing , manufactures some , if not all , of these picture cards , which are described as collotypes of an excellent quality .

		Numerous other objects of interest besides books and manuscripts are made to contribute to the variety and beauty and instructiveness of this set of post cards , and no museum could well have more or better material to draw from for this purpose than the one at
Bloomsbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE LIBRARY-USER 'S PROFITABLE INVEST - MENT , the large returns he is permitted to enjoy from a very small outlay , one finds emphasized more and more in the library re - ports from all parts of the country .

		Partly responsible for this , no doubt , is the efficiency expert , who is directing public attention to the ratio between results achieved and energy ex - pended in all departments of activity .

		From
Galesburg	LOCATION	there comes to hand the annual record of things attempted and things done by the public library of that enlightened com - munity , and in this record is to be noted the librarian 's justifiable satisfaction in reminding the Galesburghers at what a ridiculously small cost something less than one mill a day for each inhabitant they are privileged to have the run of a book-collection worth nearly forty-five thousand dollars , and files of cur - rent periodicals aggregating four hundred and fifty dollars yearly in value .

		`` Has any taxpayer in this city , '' asks the librarian in conclusion , `` invested any money that has brought him in returns of a like proportion ?

		The Library has no cause to be ashamed of its record ; it compares favorably with that of many libraries having more funds and more books .

		When the time comes for our income to be increased , we can do proportionately more ; the difficulty does not lie in not know - ing of things to do to extend the work , but in being able financially to do them . ''

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		EMEESON 'S JOURNALS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your issue of
August 16	DATE	appears an unsigned review of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's Journals that is scholarly in temper but unintentionally unfair in treatment unfair to
Emerson	PERSON	and also to his editors due , probably , to a lack of interest in the Sphinx of American writers and hence a lack of thorough - ness in a study of the Journals .

		The reviewer says that '' these Journals empha - size the fact that he is not eminently a diarist . ''

		Farther on he remarks : `` Unlike other diarists , he never shoAvs himself for a moment in undress . ''

		It seems to me that as
Amiel	PERSON	attempts to show himself in undress in a subjective way a way which he himself says did not reveal the better part of him a way that almost overcame
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's interest in
Amiel	PERSON	as a critic ,
Emerson	PERSON	shows himself in his journals in an objective way in a truly Shakespearean way .

		As he said of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, so , paraphrasing his words , can it be said of his Journals : the only biographer of
Emer	PERSON	- son is
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		And as it has been said of his poet , so can it almost be said of his effort in the Journals : '' He never stoops to be his own ex - positor in violation of nature . ''

		His Journals rep - 290 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	resented largely his effort to express men and things objectively to himself .

		Because there is no egotism in the effort , and rarely any consciousness of his self-conscious admirers and critics , he reveals him - self as he is with all his limitations as well as with a new variety of appeal that makes his Journals to me the most remarkable and the most faithful of any that ever came under my notice .

		The reviewer says of the editors that their notes of facts are '' often dryly concise '' and that their comments '' rarely reveal much of the author . ''

		It seems to me they are never dry are always illuminating , especially as to his western lecture tours in the fifties and sixties .

		I do not agree with the editors regarding the seer 's interest in
Delia Bacon	PERSON	, but their note is interesting , is neither brief nor dry , and is intended to be revealing .

		Perhaps it is .

		Certainly they are qualified to speak in ways no one else is .

		The reviewer gives a third of his space to an extract from the tenth volume , describing Haw - thorne 's funeral and
Emerson	PERSON	's comments on it and on the man as author and neighbor .

		A noble use of the space !

		But why not give a line , men - tioning from the same volume
Emerson	PERSON	's descrip - tion of the camping expedition to a mountain near Troy , N. H. ?

		The mountain climbing , the pano - rama , the wild storm , the savage shelter , are each vividly described .

		What an adventure for our aged closet-student !

		Methinks
John Burroughs	PERSON	would mention it were he re-writing his fascinating Emerson essay or , at least , make a comment on the '' Fringilla nivalis '' !

		This record is more re - freshing than that in an early volume where he tells day by day of a tramp for some ninety miles with his brothers .

		Or why not mention the record in this tenth volume , made at
Washington	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	,
February 13 , 1867	DATE	?

		We are forcibly reminded of the severity of the weather , the scarcity of railroads , and of privations and pioneers .

		No doubt there are still living in the states he visited that year
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	,
Iowa	LOCATION	,
Minnesota	LOCATION	, and
Wiscon	PERSON	- sin people who heard him lecture , and who , had our reviewer mentioned this record , would have been tempted to add this most interesting volume to their library treasures .

		Emerson 's limitation , as revealed by the Journals , is most conspicuous in his inability to appreciate
Daniel Webster	PERSON	's integrity after the '' Seventh of
March	DATE	Speech '' and
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's statesmanship prior to the
Proclamation of Emancipation	ORGANIZATION	.

		He does not mention Lincoln until
1862	DATE	, despite the fact that he visited
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, almost annually for ten years previous and was there the year of the famous debates .

		There is much meat in the Journals for comment on these two items . ''

		There was a baked-bean side even to
Emerson	LOCATION	. ''

		This humanizes him to me .

		Lincoln 's manners in
1862	DATE	offended him .

		But he defended them after he dis - covered Lincoln was a statesman .

		Emerson here shows himself in undress .

		To consider what some of the refined Lincoln flatterers of to-day would have said in their journals under similar circum - stances and dates might be to consider too curi - ously .

		At least ,
Emerson	PERSON	was honest , even if he was slightly provincial .

		We are all much more provincial than he was , and '' to be honest , as this world goes , is to be one man picked out of ten thousand . ''

		Emerson , great as he was in his achievements with himself , was greater in his efforts for what he did not attain .

		What
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	say of him as a writer is worthy of more respect than some grant .

		But , as
Arnold	LOCATION	says , he is something more important than a great philosopher or a great poet because '' he is the friend and aider of those who would live in the spirit . ''

		This is why the Essays are the most note - worthy contribution in prose in the nineteenth century .

		And this is why the Journals are more interesting than the Essays the judgment of our reviewer to the contrary notwithstanding .

		`` ALL QUIET ALONG THE POTOMAC . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I should like the opportunity to say in reply to Mr.
C. E. Benton	PERSON	's note in THE DIAL of
August 1	DATE	, which until quite recently had escaped my notice , that I have been able to find in the libraries of
Austin	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	, and
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, only two copies of
Bryant	PERSON	's '' Library of Poetry and Song '' : the 20th edition , revised , published by
J. B. Ford	ORGANIZATION	and Company in
1871	DATE	, and another published by the same company in
1872	DATE	.

		In each of these volumes the poem , `` All Quiet along the Potomac '' -LRB- or `` The Picket-guard '' -RRB- , is credited -LRB- p. 381 -RRB- to Mrs.
Ethel Lynn Beers	PERSON	, and in neither does Mrs.
Rowland	PERSON	's name appear in the index of authors .

		Since none of the earlier editions of the '' Library '' are accessible to me , I have no opportunity of verifying Mr.
Benton	PERSON	's statement or of accounting for the change if one was made of Mrs.
Rowland	PERSON	's name to Mrs.
Beers	PERSON	.

		The point , indeed , seems to me to be too unimportant to call for a longer search .


HYDER E. ROLLINS	ORGANIZATION	.

Oct. 6 , 1914	DATE	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 291 A FAMOUS THEATRICAL , TRIUMVIRATE .

		* The memories of theatre-goers not yet old go back with fondness to the glad birth of the
Gilbert	PERSON	and
Sullivan	PERSON	comic opera , almost forty years ago , when `` Trial by Jury '' conclusively demonstrated to a
London	LOCATION	audience that it was possible to devise a mirthful and musical stage whimsicality that should not depend for its laughter-provoking quality on the leading comedian 's painting his nose red or .

		indulging in boisterous buffoonery .

		To be more accu - rate , the memorable and fruitful collaboration of the humorous librettist and the no less humorous composer dates from the
year 1871	DATE	, when they surprised and delighted the fre - quenters of the Gaiety Theatre with a tuneful and rollicking production entitled , `` Thespis , or the Gods Grown Old . ' '

		If one may compare small things with great , or , rather , less great things with great , the revolution wrought by these masters in English comic opera was as important , in its way , as the change effected by ^ Eschylus in the composition and dramatic presentation of Greek tragedy , a change so great that he was even regarded by his Athenian admirers as the father of Greek tragedy .

		Certainly
Gilbert	PERSON	and
Sullivan	PERSON	will long be remembered as the originators of a style of light opera that substituted for the vapid jingles and futile rhymes characteristic of the would-be humorous musical pieces of the degenerate mid - Victorian period , a libretto that was fresh and original and brimming with unexpected and irresistible fun , and music that was in every way worthy of the admirable libretto and in the most perfect harmony with its spirit .

		Noteworthy is it , in passing , that the operas here under considera - tion were known from the first , and still con - tinue to be known , not by the name of the composer alone , nor by the names of the com - poser and the librettist , but by the names of the librettist and the composer , as if in recog - nition of
Gilbert	PERSON	's superior claims as an unexampled master of the peculiar medium in which he worked .

		None the less is it true , however , that his collaborator was the one supremely suitable co-worker to supplement his genius .

		And of the third member of the gifted triumvirate ,
Richard D'Oyly Carte	PERSON	, his was the quickness of perception that dis - cerned the mutual fitness of the two for a lasting and profitable and artistically suc - * GILBERT AND

		cessful partnership , and himself brilliantly essayed the business management of the com - bination .

		Concerning the authors of the reminiscences and anecdotes now presented in a substantial and thoroughly entertaining volume entitled `` Gilbert and
Sullivan	PERSON	, and Their Operas , '' Mr.
Frangois Cellier	PERSON	, who died eight months ago in the midst of his work on the book , was long associated with the Savoy Theatre as musical director , and enjoyed the intimacy of the noted characters about whom he writes so appreciatively ; and Mr.
Cunningham	PERSON	Bridge - man , playwright and at one time acting-man - ager of a
D'Oyly Carte	ORGANIZATION	touring company , styles himself `` one of the oldest and closest surviving associates and camp-followers of the
D'Oyly Carte Army Corps	ORGANIZATION	, '' and recalls with satisfaction that he has `` witnessed the orig - inal productions of every
Gilbert	PERSON	and
Sullivan	PERSON	opera , including that of ` Trial by Jury ' at the Royalty Theatre in
1875	DATE	, right down to what may be called the interregnum at the
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	in
1901	DATE	. ''

		This `` interregnum '' took place soon after
Sullivan	PERSON	's death , which oc - curred in
November of 1900	DATE	, and had scarcely begun when Carte himself followed his friend and associate , leaving
Gilbert	PERSON	alone of the three to fill out another decade of earthly existence .

		Other dates of importance in this chronicle of the Savoyards are
1876	DATE	, the year in which
D'Oyly Carte	ORGANIZATION	formed the
Comedy Opera Company	ORGANIZATION	, and
1881	DATE	, which saw the erection , under his supervision , of the Savoy Theatre , where for the rest of his active life he continued to exercise his managerial talents .

		The book chronicling the combined achieve - ments of these associated masters in their sev - eral fields of related activity is of a nature to call for little more from the present reviewer than a few additional details as to its con - tents and a selection of such illustrative extracts as space will permit of insertion .

		Mr.
Cellier	PERSON	's failing hand relinquishes the pen after tracing the fortunes of the Savoyards to about the close of the year
1884	DATE	and recording in this chronicle the successive triumphs achieved by such masterpieces as ``
H. M. S. Pinafore	PERSON	, '' `` The Pirates of Penzance , '' `` lo - lanthe , '' `` Princess Ida , '' and the revived earlier piece , `` The Sorcerer . ''

		Then Mr.
Bridgeman	PERSON	takes up the narrative arid fills nearly once and a half as much space with recollections of `` The Mikado , '' `` Ruddigore , '' `` The Yeomen of the Guard , '' `` The Gondo - liers , ' ' brilliant revivals of earlier operas , and other kindred matters .

		Like many another purveyor of amusement of the lighter sort , Sir
Arthur Sullivan	PERSON	had felt inward promptings to court the world 's 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	applause by means of more serious work .

		As far back as his thirteenth year he had com - posed a sacred song , `` 0
Israel	LOCATION	, '' which had been accepted and published by
Novello	PERSON	; and his brilliant orchestral accompaniment to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ' ' Tempest , ' ' composed while he was a student at the
Leipzig Conservatoire	ORGANIZATION	and performed with flattering success at a Gewandhaus concert before a distinguished audience , is probably still reckoned by some connoisseurs as his magnum opus .

		So at least thinks Mr.
Cellier	PERSON	.


Sullivan	PERSON	's pathetic song , `` Thou art passing hence , my brother , '' com - posed beside the death-bed of his dramatically and musically gifted brother Fred , also attests the composer 's possession of talents little sus - pected by the throngs that have taken delight in his comic operas .

		Paying tribute to certain phases of
Sullivan	PERSON	's versatility , Mr.
Cellier	PERSON	writes : '' But
Sullivan	PERSON	had already , notably in ' Trial by Jury , ' proved himself a born humorist , fully ca - pable of entering into the spirit and essence of his colleague 's fun .

		Such was his versatility that he was able to express in tone-words of equal elo - quence the Soliloquy of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Prospero , the grunt of
Caliban	LOCATION	, the song of Captain Cor - coran , or the patter of Sir
Joseph Porter	PERSON	.

		More - over ,
Gilbert	PERSON	's * Pinafore ' was essentially English , and
Arthur Sullivan	PERSON	's natural tone was English to his last demisemiquaver . ''

		A glimpse of the artist and the man at his work is afforded in the following : '' Long and trying as were those rehearsals , there was seldom a sign of tedium or impatience on the part of any member of the company .

		They loved their work , and , whenever
Sullivan	PERSON	came to the theatre with a fresh batch of music , every one appeared eager to hear it and hungry for more study .

		As with the chorus , so with the principals .

		There were occasions when a singer would , with full assurance of his own perfection , give forth some song hardly recognizable by the composer , whereupon
Sullivan	PERSON	would humorously commend the singer on his capital tune and then he would add ' and now , my friend , might I trouble you to try mine ? '

		I remember one instance when a tenor , as tenors are wont to do , lingered uncon - scionably on a high note .

		Sullivan interrupted him with the remark ' Yes , that 's a fine note a very fine note but please do not mistake your voice for my composition . ' ''

		The author of the `` Bab Ballads , '' unlike his colleague , can not be shown to have cher - ished aspirations to higher things within the domain of his art than those by which his chief fame was so well earned .

		Before casting in his lot with
Sullivan	PERSON	and , soon afterward , with
Sullivan	PERSON	and Carte , he had written cer - tain burlesques and extravaganzas of the ultra - frivolous sort popular in the sixties , such as ' /
Dulcamara	PERSON	, '' `` Robert the Devil , '' and `` La Vivandiere . ''

		Of this earlier and less-known
Gilbert	PERSON	we have a fleeting view in the sub - joined paragraph touching on the first night of ``
Gretchen	PERSON	, '' a play of his that was pro- duced at the Olympic in
1879	DATE	. ''

		Suffering from an acute attack of nervous debility , as he termed it , the author felt it impos - sible to remain within the theatre .

		Accordingly , he spent the evening patrolling up and down the
Strand	LOCATION	, wandering through
Covent Garden	ORGANIZATION	and
Drury Lane	ORGANIZATION	.

		He continued his peregrinations until he thought it was about time to return to the Olympic to take his call before the curtain .

		Arriv - ing at the theatre , he discovered the last fragments of the audience dispersing from the doors .

		Where - upon he addressed an outside official to whom he was unknown .

		` Is the play over ? '

		he timidly inquired . '

		Over ! '

		exclaimed the man .

		* I should rather say it was over over and done for .

		Never see 'd such a frost in all my born days . '

		Gilbert thanked his lucky stars that he had absented him - self from such a debacle our author , be it ob - served , was not accustomed to frosts . ''

		now a word as to the famous quarrel that for a brief period severed the friendly as well as the professional ties between the two men whose personalities permeate the pages of the book under review .

		It was a quarrel that at the same time involved the third member of the partnership .

		Indeed , he seems to have been the innocent author of the sad rupture .

		Mr.
Bridgeman	PERSON	, who describes this tempest in a teacup , as he calls it , neglects to give its date ; but apparently it occurred in
1891	DATE	and friendly relations were not resumed until
1893	DATE	.

		And the casus belli was a carpet !

		`` It appears that Mr.
D'Oyly Carte	PERSON	, as duly au - thorized business manager of the firm , conceived it to be , not only politic , but right and proper , to minister to the comfort of clients through whose patronage and support their business had thrived so remarkably .

		Accordingly Mr.
Carte	PERSON	purchased , among sundry other items of furniture for the renewal and repair of the theatre , a carpet .

		The carpet , et cetera , were in the usual course charged to the joint account .

		Sir
Arthur Sullivan	PERSON	, on his part , raised no objection to the outlay , and , for the sake of peace , did his utmost to persuade Mr.
Gil	PERSON	- bert to take a similar view of the matter .

		But Mr.
Gilbert	PERSON	remained obdurate in his opposition to such lavish expenditure .

		He was of opinion that a new carpet , costing 140 , would not draw an extra six - pence into the exchequer , that the theatre was so crowded nightly that no one could possibly tell or care a jot how the floor was covered .

		Mr.
Gilbert	PERSON	thought it was a sheer waste of money .

		He was then politely reminded that , by the terms of their partnership agreement , he had no voice in the matter .

		Whereupon our author waxed exceeding wroth , went to law against his old friends and com - rades , and , parting company with the Savoyards , formed a troupe of clever ' Mountebanks , ' and became their chief conjointly with one of the most
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 293 delightful of Bohemians , most amiable of men and most charming of composers whose name was
Alfred Cellier	PERSON	. ''

		Tantcene animis ccelestibus irw ?

		As absurd and insufficient was the cause of this lament - able but happily brief misunderstanding as that of much more important altercations .

		But
Gilbert	PERSON	was quick-tempered and impul - sive perhaps because he was so warm-hearted and lovable .

		Of the remaining member of the Savoy tri - umvirate , space is lacking but for the briefest word .

		Son of
Richard Carte	PERSON	, partner in the
London	LOCATION	firm of
Rudall	PERSON	and
Carte	ORGANIZATION	, makers of musical instruments , he early showed a pas - sionate love of music , but seems to have had no great conceit of his own genius in that field of art , and , wisely from a commercial point of view , turned his attention to the ex - ploiting of others ' talents rather than his own , excepting , of course , his talent for discovering histrionic and musical ability and developing its possibilities in a business way .

		As in the reminiscences of all stage folk , Mr.
Cellier	PERSON	's and Mr.
Bridgeman	PERSON	's pages are not lacking in the emotional element in what
Gilbert	PERSON	himself called `` heart-foam '' and to this ingredient they doubtless owe no little of their charm .

		There are many por - traits and other illustrations , and half a dozen facsimiles of letters .

		Notable , too , is the appended ' ' chronological list of all the operas produced at the
Opera Comique	ORGANIZATION	and
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	theatres under the D ` Oyly Carte management , from
May 15 , 1877	DATE	, to
March 1 , 1909	DATE	, with cast of each opera . ''

		Altogether , the book is an admirable record of an important period in the history of English comic opera .

		OUR NATURAL ENEMY ?

		* In
February	DATE	and
March , 1913	DATE	, Professor
J. A. Cramb	PERSON	delivered a series of lectures at
Queen 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, where he held the chair of
Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		As he lectured , his vitality ebbed , and he doubtless knew that he could not last much longer .

		Nevertheless , or indeed we may suppose because of this , he threw himself into the work with extraor - dinary ardor , giving his last message to a heedless nation .

		He was too weak to prepare the lectures for publication , and died in
October , 1913	DATE	.

		come to pass , and people now listen to his words .

		As we read , we are reminded of Carlyle : a whirlwind of rhetoric , yet tre - mendous sincerity ; a mind innocent of science , steeped in the literature of history , seeing everywhere inevitable tendencies .

		As the child grows to be a man , or perishes , so must na - tions expand , absorb , assimilate or else decay .

		The world-empire of
England	LOCATION	may be friendly or hostile to
Germany	LOCATION	; that does not matter so much ; what matters is that this empire stands in the way of German develop - ment , since , unfortunately , there is only one available world .

		From this standpoint , al - though Professor
Cramb	PERSON	did not emphasize the fact , the
United States	LOCATION	is part of the British incubus , though politically indepen - dent .

		It is indeed , with
Canada	LOCATION	, the largest and fairest part , a whole continent whereon the British idea has freely developed in the presence of unparalleled opportunity , showing in its very modifications its adaptive vitality .

		We have prided ourselves on the incorporation of a splendid German population , lovers of liberty and independent thought , seeking se - curity and opportunity among us , and finding it .

		We like to think of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	as a type of our gains in this respect , a representative of thousands less eminent , but with something of the same spirit .

		We have fancied that the German nation might properly regard us with favor on account of these things ; even with some measure of affection .

		But Professor
Cramb	PERSON	, voicing a very different feeling , in - terpreted the thought of modern
Germany	LOCATION	in these words : ''
Germany	LOCATION	, from her own inward resources , pro- duces year by year greater surplus energy , mental and physical , than any other nation in the world ; yet year by year , by emigration to
America	LOCATION	, to
England	LOCATION	, and to other lands , that surplus energy is lost to her .

		Year by year are we to look on in impotent anger or in apathy whilst the best and most enterprising of our citizens quit the Father - land and , living under other governments , cease to be Germans , bequeath their worth , that is to say their valor , to those nations who may be ultimately
Germany	LOCATION	's deadliest enemies ? ''

		Developing this idea , Professor
Cramb	PERSON	asked : '' How do
England	LOCATION	and her Empire stand in the path of the deepest desires and ambitions , and per - haps , also , the highest and most sacred aspirations of
Germany	LOCATION	?

		If we ask what those desires , ambi - tions , and aspirations are , the answer is this :
Germany	LOCATION	, not less than
England	LOCATION	, it is contended , is dowered with the genius for empire , that power in a race which , like genius in the artist , must express itself or destroy its possessor .

		An Empire she once had , centuries before
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	fought .

		That empire is lost .

		But in the German race the instinct for empire is as ancient and as deeply rooted as it is in the English race ; and in the 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16 Germany	DATE	of the present time , above all , this in - stinct , by reason of the very strength of
Germany	LOCATION	within herself , her conscious and vital energy , her sense of deep and repressed forces , is not a mere cloud in the brain , but is almost an imperious necessity .

		This is the real driving-force in German politics , the essential thing . ''

		Hence the inevitable conflict , the ostensible causes of which do but mask the fruition of a tree , the growth of which might have been witnessed by all who cared to see , these twenty years past .

		Hence , said Professor
Cramb	PERSON	, all talk of peace is nonsense .

		Believing himself to under - stand the German temper , sympathizing with its purpose , but desiring
Britain	LOCATION	to be pre - pared , he could scarcely find language to ex - press his contempt of those who hoped , by conferences and mutual agreements , to ensure the peace of the world . ''

		England and
Germany	LOCATION	on which is
Pacif	LOCATION	- icism likelier to exercise a deleterious and a dan - gerous effect ?

		From to-day 's survey of eternal abstract principles , as from last week 's survey of ephemeral yet not insignificant criticism of
England	LOCATION	and her Empire , it becomes apparent that
Germany	LOCATION	is not
England	LOCATION	's only enemy , perhaps not even her chief . ''

		So finally , with belligerent phrases , the book ends as follows : `` And if the dire event of a war with
Germany	LOCATION	if it is a dire event should ever occur , there shall be seen upon this earth of ours a conflict which , beyond all others , will recall that description of the great Greek wars : ' Heroes in battle with heroes , And above them the wrathful gods . '

		And one can imagine the ancient , mighty deity of all the Teutonic kindred , throned above the clouds , looking serenely down upon that conflict , upon his favourite children , the English and the Germans , locked in a death-struggle , smiling upon the hero - ism of that struggle , the heroism of the children of Odin the War-god ! ''

		Professor
Cramb	PERSON	was not insane .

		He cor - rectly interpreted the feeling of those respon - sible for the present war , and illustrated , in his person , the reaction of a highly endowed mind in a particular educational environment .

		In their native endowment , the Germanic and English races are not so different as to be irreconcilable .

		This was recognized in the lament that Germans are so easily incor - porated in the body politic of
America	LOCATION	, and `` cease to be Germans . ''

		What do they cease to be ?

		Do they lose , by the mere process of transplanting to another continent , their Teu - tonic inheritance ?

		If so , of what avail is a German world-empire ?

		No one pretends that they lose it ; what they do lose , if anything , is the Germanic tradition of world-empire , the Germanic hostility to all other men , be - cause they are other men .

		Or , again , why this agitation because of peaceful tendencies in
England	LOCATION	?

		Is that country in danger of put - ting off its ancient virility ?

		If it is , it is not by the process which excited the wrath of Professor
Cramb	PERSON	.

		For good biological rea - sons , we may think it necessary to bestir ourselves , on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, to preserve and perpetuate what is best in our blood , but we need not take the fury born of a militant propaganda for stability or strength .

		It is a long and many-sided story , but al - ways we come back to this : given a virile race , it remains for education to decide whether it shall further or hinder the orderly progress of the species .


Germany	LOCATION	, and above all the German rulers , preoccupied with ideas of do - minion and of war , trained to think of fighting as the noblest aim , must sooner or later have broken the peace .

		How far and in what measure other countries are to blame is unim - portant for the argument .

		The truth is that all this misery results from teachings and traditions which are considered not criminal only because they have public sanction .

		Pro- fessor
Cramb	PERSON	was so far the victim of such teachings that he not only saw what was about to happen , but substantially approved .

		It remains for
America	LOCATION	, with all her imper - fections , to make the great sociological dis - coveries .

		We are demonstrating to an aston - ished world that alcoholic liquor is not neces - sary for happiness .

		We are able to live unafraid next door to
Canada	LOCATION	, with no forts or standing armies on the border .

		Not without difficulty , it is true , we have shown that it is possible for a great nation to have at its head one who is as much of a gentleman in his public as in his private capacity , and who is , above all , a genuine representative of the spirit of peace .

		Never before has `` political necessity '' counted for so little and decency for so much .

		We do not agree with everything our gov - ernment does .

		It requires little knowledge of public affairs to discover stupidity or worse in high places ; we reserve our right to criticize , and will not endorse all the actions of any party or man in advance .

		In science one discovery opens the way to a hundred others ; so also in national affairs every ad - vance points the way to others , and `` divine discontent '' is the motive force of progress .

		The labor is incessant and there is no haven of rest , but we have at least the hope and belief that it is possible to progress from good to better , without periodically relapsing into the barbarism of wholesale murder .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 295 THE CASE FOB THE MATRIARCHATE .

		* Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	seems completely to have abandoned
Spain	LOCATION	and Spanish art , on which she was a well-known writer , for feminism .

		This year she follows '' The Truth about Woman '' with a study of the position of women in primitive society entitled ' ' The Age of the Mother-Power , '' and it is understood that next year she will have ready a volume on motherhood .

		There is no doubt about her faith or her purpose in writing the present book .

		In her judgment , the case of feminism may be ma - terially strengthened if it can be shown that at one time in the history of the race woman was the dominating factor in the family , whose authority over her children and her possessions was acknowledged .

		The patent manifestations of this domination in the ma - ternal clan , whereby the names of children and the inheritance of property passed through woman , are abundant .

		But , owing to the exuberance of Bachofen and his school in defending their thesis with more zeal than knowledge , much discredit has been thrown in some quarters upon the existence of a matriarchate , or the rule of mother-right .

		`` We are , to be sure , dealing with a hypothesis , but with one which alone will explain customs and conditions proved to have existed in almost all parts of the world in primitive times , and of which there are innumerable traces among both primitive and civilized races to the pres - ent day .

		Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	, then , is a staunch defender of the matriarchate as having ex - isted , and she has adduced strong reasons for her qualified admiration of it .

		Her original - ity to the student of primitive society is found in her claim that the maternal clan in which woman was the dominating factor was not the first stage of human society , as has been gen - erally contended by its partisans , but that it grew out of a primitive patriarchal society as a needed reform of the abuses imposed by the sexual jealousy of the ape-patriarch over his harem of wives and daughters .

		As a measure of self-protection making for free - dom and cooperation among women , it was a timely step toward social peace .

		It stood for social progress because it was based upon the general good instead of that of the individual , and because it vested with real and permanent as well as with sentimental power the child - bearing portion of the human race .

		The proof of the existence of mother-right , which Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	felt that she had to establish anew , is based upon the same time - * THE AGE OF THE MOTHER-POWER .

		honored travellers ' and anthropologists ' tales which have been bandied about for fifty years by all writers on the matriarchate .

		The cus - toms of Algonquins , Creeks ,
Pueblos	LOCATION	,
Malays	LOCATION	, Zunis , Australian Bushmen , and Touaregs of the
Sahara	LOCATION	are not only hackneyed , but they leave the reader cold .

		With the Jews , Greeks , Romans , and Celts we are nearer home , and we wish more evidence might be drawn from the customs of these races with which we have more affinity .

		The historians of human so - ciety seem to be condemned to wander in a far-off , if happy , hunting-ground .

		However , once more the existence of the matriarchate is claimed , and its place in the age following the patriarchal age is credibly established .

		The chapter which accounts for the inevitable reestablishment of man in his place of au - thority is interesting and more novel .

		This reestablishment of father-right was due to the developed sense of individuality and of prop - erty , in which even woman came to be bought from !

		her relatives as a chattel : `` As soon as women became sexually marketable their free - dom was doomed . ''

		Under this third system , or the reestablished patriarchal system , under which we still live , the bride leaves the pro- tection of her family and forms with her hus - band and children a new individual unit in which her position is one of subjection sexual , legal , and ecclesiastical .

		Individual - ism triumphed , but brought with it jealousy and sham morality .

		Each one of these three supposed epochs in human society has had its raison d'etre , and each has marked in some sense a progress over the preceding .

		All the more reason why there should be another effort to restore the now deranged sexual equilibrium and , after some fashion not yet clearly indicated , give woman again such freedom of choice and action as will enable her to give full expression to her womanhood .

		Society must constantly evolve toward something higher .

		Mrs.
Gallichan	PERSON	's interest in the position of woman in primitive society is plainly sub - servient to her interest in present-day fem - inism .

		She has had the ingenuity to seek in primitive history and legend grounds for a popular campaign .

		She is not conventional where morality is concerned .

		But her aspira - tions are reassuring and will have a hearing from the other sex : `` Women must gain eco - nomic security , and the freedom for the full expression of their womanhood .

		The ultimate goal I conceive at least I hope is the right to be women , not to become like men .

		There can be no gain for women except this .

		To be mothers were women created , and to be fathers men .

		This rightly considered is the 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	deepest of all truths . ''

		The picture drawn of the age when woman exercised rights equal , if not superior , to those of men is pertinent to the discussion of the pending problem , and it contains elements which may serve as a partial modus operandi for the reconquest of her place by woman in our own day .

		This book , while starting with second-hand docu - ments , has presented a somewhat novel con - clusion , and has `` connected up '' an academic discussion with a vital issue .

		AMERICAN POLITICAL , PARTIES .

		* During the year 1912-3 Professor
William M. Sloane	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, in the capacity of Roosevelt Professor , delivered at the universities of
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Munich	LOCATION	an ex - tended series of lectures upon the subject of political parties and party phenomena in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The lectures , in German form , were published immediately in
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		In English dress , revised , and brought down to date , they are now presented to students and readers of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		The subject is obviously one of appalling magnitude and complexity .

		We have several high-grade general histories of the
United States	LOCATION	; we have no small number of excellent books upon various selected phases of Ameri - can party history and machinery ; but we do not have any really comprehensive , pene - trating , and well-balanced treatise on our party system as a whole .

		The nearest ap - proach to a work of the kind is to be found in the writings of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	and Professor
Ostrogorski	PERSON	.

		But these keen observers did not undertake to deal with all aspects of the sub - ject , and their achievement has been rather the discernment and characterization of note - worthy party phenomena than the detailed presentation of party history or the systematic description of party organization and activi - ties .

		In a measure , Professor
Sloane	PERSON	's book fills the gap ; but only in a measure , for it is too brief to be more than a substantial outline of the subject , and highly important phases of present-day party machinery and action are scarcely touched upon in it .

		The author 's method is primarily , as it should be , historical .

		Beginning with a few very brief chapters on political ideas in eight - eenth century
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, he moves forward chronologically through the national history of the country to our own time , stating the external facts of party affairs very briefly , explaining the origins and character of new * PARTY GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES OF

		party phenomena as they arise , and supplying withal a considerable amount of carefully con - sidered and illuminating philosophical inter - pretation .

		In fact , the value of Professor
Sloane	PERSON	's work lies principally at the last - mentioned point , in his linking up of the growth of parties and the general economic and political development of the country .

		For the details of party history , and especially of party workings , one will have to look else - where .

		For a running commentary , however , on the growth of party government in the country , written in the large by a student of world history , and therefore involving some detached points of view and a wealth of allu - sion likely to be beyond the reach of the narrower specialists in the field , Professor
Sloane	PERSON	's book will probably stand for some time in a class by itself .

		The most imperative of all political prob - lems in the
United States	LOCATION	at the present day .

		in the opinion of the author , is the relation of parties and democracy .

		With the progress of the doctrines of the initiative , referendum , and recall of the conception that the people should rule directly and that representatives should be at best simple delegates what is to become of party ?

		The first thing to be ascertained , however , is whether these new doctrines are really going to ' ' progress . ' '

		Pro- fessor
Sloane	PERSON	admits that it is `` in this direc - tion that all present-day political action trends '' ; although it would seem that he might have taken more account of the numer - ous evidences that a reaction has already set in .

		In any event , he pronounces the sup - posedly accepted opinions `` snap judgments '' and declares , naturally enough , that their ulti - mate effect upon party conditions can not at this stage be foreseen .

		One type of party machinery seems to be disappearing , and the role of party principles is less important than once it was .

		But whether we are in the midst of a real transition to conditions permanently different or on the eve of a backward swing to the conditions of a generation ago , no man can say .

		It is a thesis of Professor
Sloane	PERSON	that `` the political feature of greatest significance since
1850	DATE	has been the steady growth in power of the presidency '' ; and one of the most sug - gestive chapters in the book is that in which is discussed the subject `` Parties and the Presidency . ''

		Written in days very recent , this chapter takes some account of the evi - dence drawn from the history of the present administration which tends to sustain the gen - eral proposition .

		But it would seem that a larger amount of evidence is at hand than has been cited .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 297 The book contains no bibliography ; there are practically no foot-notes or other refer - ences to documents ; and although there is an appendix , the reason for including in it some of its contents is not obvious .

		NIETZSCHE AXD DR. BR ANDES .

		* Nietzsche and Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	were born to know each other .

		They were , in one of those familiar phrases to which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	con - trived to give a sort of mystical import , ' ' good Europeans . ' '

		What is destined to be , is , never - theless , often mysteriously delayed , so that waste results .

		It was not until
1887	DATE	that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	first wrote to
Nietzsche	LOCATION	; the corre - spondence that thereupon ensued lasted until the eclipse of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's intellect , early in
1889	DATE	.

		Now that the letters have been given to the world , one can estimate the waste that resulted from the late meeting of the most provocative German writer of our time and the most curious and insatiable of living critics .

		The letters are introduced by an essay , pro- jected by Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	as early as
1887	DATE	, in the hope of stimulating in
Denmark	LOCATION	an interest in
Nietzsche	LOCATION	's writings .

		At that time Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	could not , he tells us , assume a knowl - edge of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		Did not
Nietzsche	PERSON	himself , in chaffing his friend on the proposed undertaking , express amazement that he should dare to speak in public of a vir obscurissimus ?

		The essay had to be chiefly an exposition , and Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	assures us it has , on that ac - count , been largely `` outstripped . ''

		But he is altogether too modest .

		The very sub-title he chose reveals the penetration one expects of him `` An Essay on Aristocratic Radical - ism . ''

		`` What could be happier ?

		Nietzsche himself enthusiastically approved the phrase .

		`` The expression ' aristocratic radicalism , ' which you employ , is , '' he hastens to write , `` very good .

		It is , permit me to say , the cleverest thing I have yet read about myself . ''

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	admits that he had hit upon this epithet after a prayerful examination of his own mind .

		It covered much that the two men had in common .

		Later , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	was bitterly and inexplicably assailed as a rene - gade and charged with having modified his own liberal opinions as a result of his enthusi - astic reading of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		Those who assailed him had thought of him as a radical ; they forgot , or had never discerned , that he was also an aristocratic radical .

		That is to say ,
FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE	PERSON	.

		The
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: they overlooked the quite obvious fact that he was not the sort of man to surrender his critical sense in the face of a sentimental en - thusiasm .

		But Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	found then a defence which gives us a key to his fine critical method and is expressive of one of the leading enthusiasms of the modern mind .

		He said : `` No mature reader studies
Nietzsche	PERSON	with the latent design of adopting his opinions , still less with that of propagating them .

		`` We are not children in search of instruction , but skeptics in search of men , and we rejoice when we have found a man the rarest thing there is . ''

		The attack was the more absurd because , although the essay is mainly descriptive and biographical , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	did not fail to indi - cate where his thought was at variance with
Nietzsche 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		They were together in their hatred of ascetic ideals as well as in their pro- found disgust with democratic mediocrity ; and they were distrustful of current culture , that professorial culture which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	happily called `` Culture-Philistinism . ''

		On the other hand , Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	did not agree with
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's reading of history .

		He pro- fessed himself unable to understand
Nietzsche	PERSON	's contempt for the morality of pity ; and , lastly , he -LRB- good , uncompromising feminist -RRB- could not reconcile himself to the philosopher 's dictum that we ought , in our treatment of women , to return to `` the vast common sense of old
Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		No , such was not Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's idea .

		Yet even at that point they had something in common , for he was quite willing to subscribe to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's view that the free and great spirit is unfit for marriage .

		The only differ - ence between them was that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	could not bring himself to believe that all free and great spirits tread the earth in male bodies .

		It is plain enough , too , that Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	found it hard to understand why a modern man of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's intellectual power should be willing to lash himself into a fury over the Christian religion .

		To him all that was like an echo from remote battlefields of the human spirit ; he would as soon have thought of ' ' assailing a belief in werewolves as a belief in Christianity . ' '

		But a word more and we shall turn to the letters .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	found as early as
1899	DATE	ten years after the publication of the first essay the true characterization of the nature of the attacks on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		No better state - ment of it is needed than this one : `` The opposition to him is conducted sometimes -LRB- as by
Ludwig Stein	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- on serious and scientific lines , although from narrow pedagogic premises ; sometimes -LRB- as by
Herr Max	ORGANIZATION	Nor - dau -RRB- with sorry weapons and with the 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	assumed superiority of presumptuous medioc - rity . ''

		The fact that the public does not resent this interference amounts really to a confession of intellectual immaturity .

		We tacitly admit that we are children who have to be protected from a malign influence , not skeptics in search of men .

		The letters themselves tend to confirm exist - ing impressions of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's character rather than to upset them .

		Much that we should naturally infer from a reading of his books is here underscored and presented with the free informal emphasis of good talk .

		There is something of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's influence on the early
Nietzsche	LOCATION	; of the state of his health and its effect on his writings ; of the ecstacy of pure thought -LRB- to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	what one thinks is only a measure of one 's courage , and he was always wondering whether he would have courage enough -RRB- ; of marriage and other ' ' old institutions . ''

		It is needless to say that it is all very sincere and penetrating talk .

		From it there emerges
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's delight in sheer diablerie .

		It is almost naive .

		It par - takes of the vulgar passion to shock the bour - geoisie .

		But in a philosopher it has an oddly winning quality .

		Philosophers do not com - monly pay us the compliment of shocking us .

		Nietzsche , on the other hand , delighted to regard himself as the `` bogyman '' of the modern world , a German artilleryman turned philosopher .

		Thus , he writes to his friend , apropos of the appearance of a new book : '' With a cynicism that will become famous in the world 's history , I have now related myself .

		The book is called '
Ecce Homo	PERSON	, ' and is an attack on the Crucified without the slightest reservation ; it ends in thunders and lightnings against every - thing that is Christian or infected with
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , till one is blinded and deafened .

		I am in fact the first psychologist of Christianity and , as an old artilleryman , can bring heavy guns into action , the existence of which no opponent of Christianity has even suspected .

		The whole is the prelude to the ' Transvaluation of All Values , ' the work that lies ready before me : I swear to you that in two years we shall have the whole world in convulsions .

		I am a fate . ''

		Guess who come off worst in ' Ecce Home ' ?

		Messieurs the Germans !

		I have told them terrible things ... The Germans , for instance , have it on their conscience that they deprived the last great epoch of history , the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, of its meanings at a moment when the Christian values , the de - cadence values , were worsted , when they were con - quered in the instincts even of the highest ranks of the clergy by the opposite instincts , the in - stincts of life .

		To attack the Church that meant to re-establish Christianity .

		-LRB-
Cesare Borgia	ORGANIZATION	as pope tbat would have been the meaning of the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, its proper symbol . -RRB- ''

		Or , again he writes : '' In a month or two something philosophical may be expected ; under the very inoffensive title of ' Leisure Hours of a Psychologist ' I am saying agreeable and disagreeable things to the world at large including that intelligent nation , the Ger - nlans . ''

		But all this is in the main nothing but recrea - tion beside the main thing : the name of the latter is ' Transvaluation of All Values . '

		Europe will have to discover a new
Siberia	LOCATION	, to which to consign the author of these experiments with values . ''

		Nietzsche 's belief in the ministration of pain is familiar enough .

		For years he en - dured excruciating headaches , which some - times prostrated him for two hundred days in the year .

		His fortitude was nothing short of heroic , but it had its supreme rewards .

		Writing of the period from
1876	DATE	to
1881	DATE	, he says : '' My speciality was to endure extreme pain , cru , vert , with perfect clarity , for two or three consecutive days , accompanied by constant vomit - ing of bile .

		The report has been put about that I am in a madhouse -LRB- and indeed that I died there -RRB- .

		Nothing is further from the truth .

		As a matter of fact my intellect only came to maturity during that terrible time : witness the
' Dawn of Day	DATE	, ' which I wrote in
1881	DATE	during a winter of incredible suffering at
Genoa	LOCATION	, away from doctors , friends or relations ... After all , my illness has been of the greatest use to me : it has released me , it has restored to me the courage to be myself ... And , indeed , in virtue of my instincts , I am a brave animal , a military one even .

		The long resistance has somewhat exasperated my pride .

		Am I a philosopher , do you ask ?

		But what does that matter ... '' In selecting passages for reproduction from these letters , which touch so many subjects , one is exasperated by the sense that what one omits is quite as much to the point as what one gives .

		But there is an episode that must be related : it shows so clearly the playful adroitness in practical affairs of which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	was capable and illustrates the psychological acumen that made these two `` good Europeans '' such delightful letter writers .

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	, preparing to lecture on
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, begs for a photograph .

		Nietzsche replies that he has none , but his friend will not be put off .

		Nietzsche thereupon takes measures of his own : '' Meanwhile , '' he writes , `` I hope my photograph will have reached you .

		It goes without saying that I took steps , not exactly to be photographed -LRB- for I am extremely distrustful of haphazard photographs -RRB- , but to abstract a photograph from somebody who had one of me . ''

		Doubtless that was a clever idea , but it failed to satisfy his friend , for we find him replying : `` The letters and the music were an unqualified pleasure ; the portrait might have been better .

		It is a profile taken at
Naumburg	ORGANIZATION	, characteristic in
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 299 its attitude , but with too little expression .

		You must have looked different from this ; the writer of Zarathustra must have had more secrets written in his own face . ''

		And
Nietzsche	PERSON	confesses the truth : '' What eyes you have !

		You are right , the
Nietzsche	PERSON	of the photograph is not yet the author of Zarathustra he is a few years too young for that . ''

		The communion of these two vigorous and independent spirits was not destined to endure for long , but there is convincing proof that it left a profound impression on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	had offered him the priceless gift of intelligent sympathy when he knew little but neglect or stupid opposition .

		Is it strange , then , that the memory of this resolute friend of his should have remained with
Nietzsche	PERSON	to the last flicker of intelligence and even passed over into the twilight ?

		The final letter , that now famous and infinitely pathetic letter , signed ' ' The Crucified , ' ' undated , unstamped , and addressed simply `` To the Friend Georg '' how it bears witness to the strength of those genuine friendships that are based on a pro- found community of the mind .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* It is the new novelists who most excite our curiosity .

		The familiar ones , however good , have so few surprises for us that we do not look forward to any .

		For that matter , the new ones are seldom startling .

		A good novel by an unknown author is rare ; a first-rate one is the event of a decade .

		Reviewers discover first-rate ones oftener than that , of course ; but reviewers are peculiarly susceptible : their anxiety makes them so .

		Mr.
Edward C. Venable	PERSON	is not an event ; but he is distinctly a surprise .

		He is altogether new to us and his novel is more than passable .

		He has told his story in the first person , which seems to have given his faculty for making amusing observations free play .

		The book opens with
Pierre Vinton	PERSON	's reflections on his divorce from his wife ,
Marcella	PERSON	.

		They lived together for three years , lived separately for two years , and then secured a divorce on grounds of incom - patibility .

		It was all done without any scan - dal , so that everybody was satisfied , except
Pierre	PERSON	.

		Marcella , and that was a good deal .

		His sense of loss was not mitigated by his conviction that it was due to a failure on his part in the only task he had ever seriously undertaken in his life .

		His friend , Mrs.
Axson	PERSON	, said that he was tired of
Marcella	PERSON	and that she was tired of him , and that `` that was all there was to it . ''

		The rector of St.
Stephen	PERSON	's had nothing but words to offer .

		Mrs.
Malory	PERSON	, who made a fetish of motherhood and domesticity , said the whole trouble was that
Marcella	PERSON	had had no children .

		Pierre 's cousin
Phillippe	PERSON	, who belonged in
France	LOCATION	, explained : '' * You amused her as a lover , because you were rich and she was poor ; but you bored her as a husband . ' ''

		` You touch , ' I said , ' the very heart of the matter .

		I failed as a husband .

		What is a husband ,
Phillippe	PERSON	f '' ' The good God only knows / answered
Phillippe	PERSON	calmly . '

		He is a woman 's nearest approach to a good friend , perhaps ... ' '' When Mrs.
Malory	PERSON	heard that
Marcella	PERSON	would have a little flat all to herself and make her own living , she was surprised into murmuring , `` I think it would be the loveliest thing in the world ' ' ; which is a pleasant bit of irony .

		Mar - cella might have married again , but
Pierre	PERSON	heard of her engagement and assaulted her fiance .

		Then there was nothing to do but to go away .

		Up to this point the story Mr.
Venable	PERSON	has to tell is true and interesting , but this point is that at which the real story should begin .

		And that story Mr.
Venable	PERSON	has no intention of telling .

		The situation , an excellent one if he had the knowledge or the will , or whatever he lacks , to work it out , is hurriedly abandoned .

		Pierre lets his foot slip in the Alps , and is picked up with a fractured skull .

		Marcella hastens to him , knowing at last that `` there is no divorce , there is only release , ' ' and they are reunited as soon as he is out of his delirium .

		Thus a novel apparently well begun , and one written with humor and force , falls to pieces except , of course , for the sentimental reader .

		Mr.
Samuel Hopkins Adams	PERSON	is familiar enough to the readers of `` Collier 's Weekly '' but hardly to those who buy novels or rent them for
three cents	MONEY	a day .

		His book , `` The Health Master , ' ' was a novel in form only .

		It is therefore a pleasant surprise to have a story from him as good as `` The Clarion . ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has managed to combine in it the things he has picked up as a newspaper man and the things he learned in `` muck-raking '' the patent-medicine industry .

		The situation on which the story turns is like that of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's `` An Enemy of the People , '' except that it is complicated by a number of subsidiary situa - tions .

		The hero ,
Harrington Surtaine	PERSON	, comes home after college and
Europe	LOCATION	to a father -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	who began life as an itinerant vender of a panacea , and who became the millionaire owner of a patent-medicine business .

		The young man wishes the first week to thrash the editor of a local paper which attacks his father and , failing in this , he buys out the proprietor .

		Then his education in the practical affairs of American life begins .

		It is rounded off to a degree by his experience during an epidemic which the business men of the town wish to conceal .

		The action is obvious and the style is crude , but the whole somehow makes what we call ' ' a good story . ' '

		A novelist who took his art more seriously would have wanted as much space for the development of young Sur - taine 's first adventures with a newspaper , or his father 's character , or any one of several other matters , as Mr.
Adams	PERSON	has devoted to all of thenr .

		But while Mr.
Adams	PERSON	is neither deep nor delicate he is readable , in the jour - nalistic sense .

		Mr.
J. D. Beresford	PERSON	is not a new and un - proved writer , but one still little known to the general public .

		`` The
House	ORGANIZATION	in Demetrius Road '' is a realistic study of a dipsomaniac , and one done rather as Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	would do it than as would the press-agent of the
Anti-Saloon League	ORGANIZATION	.

		The chief figure is a young
Scotchman	PERSON	,
Robin Greg	PERSON	.

		The only other important characters are
Martin Bond	ORGANIZATION	, who becomes
Greg	PERSON	's secretary , and
Margaret Hamilton	PERSON	, a sister-in-law of
Greg	PERSON	's , who comes to Demetrius Road to keep house for him .

		Martin seems a singularly naive young man .

		He fails to discover the mystery of the house - hold until
Margaret	PERSON	tells him that
Greg	PERSON	is a victim of alcohol .

		The two endeavor to cure
Greg	PERSON	by means of a drug , and
Margaret	PERSON	goes so far as to promise to marry him as soon as the passage of the act permitting a man to marry his deceased wife 's sister makes it pos - sible .

		But the drug fails and
Margaret	PERSON	falls in love with
Martin	PERSON	.

		The final scene -LRB- and one admirably prepared for -RRB- is that in which
Greg	PERSON	tells the young people that they have betrayed him and orders them to leave the house .

		`` It was all so specious , it wore such an air of un - deniable truth , ' ' that
Martin	PERSON	was overwhelmed .

		Mr.
Beresford	PERSON	has written truly and well in every respect save one .

		His story needs an important figure , such a figure as
Greg	PERSON	was apparently intended to be , but is not .

		The procession of novels in series , especially European ones , continues .

		The first season which fails to bring a section of one of these remarkable works in three or four volumes by a foreign novelist will be a disappointment .

		There was ' '
Jean Christophe	PERSON	' ' ; there is ' ' Pelle the Conqueror '' ; and now comes the first vol - ume of `` The Books of the Small Souls . ''

		Its author , Mr.
Louis Couperus	PERSON	, is a notable fig - ure in his native
Holland	LOCATION	, but he is virtually new to this country .

		Mr.
de Mattos	PERSON	, who has translated `` Small Souls '' into English and whose enthusiasm in this case seems quite as genuine as it was in that -LRB- for which we are so grateful -RRB- of
M. Fabre	PERSON	, promises that the re - maining volumes of the history of the van
Lowe	PERSON	family will be forthcoming whenever the public asks for them .

		Mr.
de Mattos	PERSON	's implied doubt of the public is probably a justifiable one .

		For `` Small Souls '' is distinctly not the kind of good work which arouses wide interest in a new author .

		It is perhaps true that the best work is never too good for the public .

		But fine examples of the realistic novel are very slow to find readers , at least in English .

		Has it not required more than thirty years to reach the modest number of persons who have read Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's `` A Mummer 's Wife '' ?

		And that book was not under the handicap of being , with all that the fact im - plies , a translation , though it did , perhaps , deal with as small souls as those who furnish Mr.
Couperus	PERSON	with a title .

		The van
Lowe	PERSON	family , members of the Dutch bourgeoisie , are displayed by a simple device .

		It happens that a daughter ,
Constance	PERSON	, became disgracefully involved , shortly after her marriage , with young van der Welcke , a member of the diplo - matic service in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Family pressure had brought about a divorce for
Constance	PERSON	and a marriage with her lover .

		The scandal had abruptly ended van der
Welcke	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		Their passion was dead ; they blamed each other for their exile from
Holland	LOCATION	and respectability ; their only pride was in their son ,
Adriaan	LOCATION	; and in regard to him each was jealous of the other .

		Finally , they decide to go home to The Hague in spite of everything ; and at this point the novel begins .

		There is little that is large or kind or generous in the record of what follows .

		Adriaan , though a boy , is the only person who can be respected .

		He is compelled to maintain the balance between his father and mother and to witness their selfishly ineffectual attempts to rehabilitate themselves against the cruel opposition of the family and its circle .

		It is he who finds the just but bitter comment at the end , when the family is precipitated into a violent and vulgar quarrel .

		He says : `` And all about nothing ! ''

		A direct attack on a cer - tain sort of bourgeois society , by no means confined to
Holland	LOCATION	, could hardly be more pointed than `` Small Souls , '' but the reader is not made unpleasantly conscious of the author 's critical purpose .

		Mr.
Couperus	PERSON	is not a tractarian in novelist 's clothes ; he is an exceptional artist in prose fiction .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 301 BlUEFS ON 1STEW BOOKS .

		TA.Afatonr.rt The , catalogue of Egyptological the literature of works lathered by Dr. Budge 01 ra * the British Museum is length - ened anew by two brief popular treatises `` written by request , '' `` A History of the Egyptian People ' ' and ' ' The Literature of the Egyptians '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The companion vol - umes are well printed , the illustrations are clear , and the colored frontispieces give a desir - able idea of the Egyptian use of color .

		The one - page map is , however , on too small a scale and deals with modern
Egypt	LOCATION	only , giving no clue even to the capitals ,
Memphis	LOCATION	and
Thebes	LOCATION	, of the ancient nation with which Dr. Budge 's history primarily deals .

		In tracing the po - litical career , the chapter-division puts into the `` Middle Empire '' the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties , representing what is commonly counted the flower of the `` New Empire , ' ' and includes under the latter head - ing everything which has occurred since then until to-day -LRB- from
Cleopatra	LOCATION	on in outline only -RRB- .

		Religion and daily life , saved for later chapters , lose much of their possible signifi - cance when thus divorced from the events of which they were the setting ; and statements applying to different ages , grouped together , give an accurate impression of none .

		The chronology , of which the author takes an anti- quated and unwarrantably pessimistic view , is relegated to the final chapter .

		It is respon - sible for Dr. Budge 's belief that
Egypt	LOCATION	bor - rowed from
Babylonia	LOCATION	the idea of such objects as the mace and the cylinder seal ; but , accord - ing to the most careful mjodern chronological research , civilization first grew up in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Some other superseded theories and occasional misstatements find a place , while results of recent years may be passed over .

		References in the bibliography at the end are not always to the latest edition or the latest treatise ; and the proof-reader had a grudge against German book-titles .

		As to literature , the reader who has hitherto had to search among such series as the `` Library of the World 's Best Literature '' -LRB- a search well worth while -RRB- is indebted to Dr. Budge for the ' ' first attempt made to place be - fore the public a summary of the principal con - tents of Egyptian Literature in a handy and popular form . ''

		This volume is , however , unsystematically arranged , the religious ele - ment -LRB- which is excessively prominent -RRB- appear - ing at both ends as well as in the middle .

		In spite of this , the great hymn to
Aton	ORGANIZATION	, in which King Amenhetep IV .

		sounded the key-note of the world 's first monotheism , is not included .

		The author has often , wisely chosen para - phrase or synopsis in order to escape the wealth of inessential allusions which embellish the course of Egyptian documents .

		Where literal translations are incorporated , viola - tions of Egyptian grammatical principles and an often unjustified certainty of meaning are noticeable .

		Fortunately , the large aspects of Egyptian thought as presented in its litera - ture may be grasped without regard to these details .

		Dr. Budge has given us two neat and handy , but ill-digested , books .


Columbia Correctly	ORGANIZATION	assuming that there is ttThirtwand no one educational institution in its problems .

		this country that can be called the great
American University	ORGANIZATION	, and that some excel in one thing and others in another , Dean
Keppel	ORGANIZATION	has successfully endeavored in his volume entitled `` Columbia '' -LRB-
Oxford Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Press -RRB- to emphasize those matters in which his Alma Mater differs from her sister institutions and to pass over universal char - acteristics as briefly as possible .

		That was a happy scheme to adopt , for
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity is nothing if not here and there unique .

		Founded in
1754	DATE	, when
Manhattan Island	LOCATION	had fewer inhabitants than
the University	ORGANIZATION	now has students , it grew irregularly until about
1890	DATE	; since then its growth has been so nearly matchless that the present figures astound one : 54 departments of instruction , 740 teachers , 3644 special students ,
9929	DATE	regu - lar students , and buildings and grounds aggre - gating
$ 54,000,000	MONEY	in value and all of this in the city of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Dean
Keppel	ORGANIZATION	sin - cerely deplores the large number of students ; and this is typical of the spirit of the entire book .

		It will readily be seen that , with such a plant , complicated as it is and consisting of schools within schools , educational problems have arisen and continue to arise , the solution of which is extraordinarily difficult , as well as provocative of feeling .

		All of these Dean
Keppel	ORGANIZATION	discusses so logically and amiably that outsiders will be forced to admire and insiders to be patient with the trend of things at
Morningside Heights	LOCATION	.

		The book is , in a way , a contribution to the general history of education in this country , with an occa - sional lapse into pedagogical observations , one of which is not sufficiently elaborated : the relation of research to teaching .

		All will subscribe to the plea that is made for the good teacher .

		But lack of the time -LRB- and the inval - uable energy -RRB- for research by no means guar - antees good teaching .

		Indeed it just happens that in Dean
Keppel	ORGANIZATION	's own
Columbia	LOCATION	, those particular men whose courses are uniformly voted the most useful -LRB- not simply the most popular -RRB- are , in the great majority of in - stances , the same men who are most interested 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	in and the most successfully engaged in re - search .

		Statistics concerning the men of research and the men of teaching in American universities might throw bright light on a dark issue .

		One omission on the historical side we note : the fact that there is no men - tion of Lorenzo da Ponte -LRB- 1749-1838 -RRB- , the author of the librettos of
Mozart	PERSON	's `` Figaro , '' ``
Don Giovanni	PERSON	, '' and `` Cosi fan tutte , '' who taught Italian at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	from
1828	DATE	on .

		The charming illustrations , pleasing style , and abundant humor , can only make all

		A member of the

		His father was a stone-mason , and he followed the custom of the country by learning the ancestral trade .

		But he was destined for better things .

		Himself penniless , a school friend advanced the money needed to bring him to
America	LOCATION	, and he landed in
New York	LOCATION	only twenty years ago , unable to speak the language and too little experienced in the world 's ways to earn any - thing but the most desultory livelihood either in or out of the little Syrian colony of those days .

		His experiences included clerking in a store owned by one of his countrymen , unsuc - cessful attempts to peddle silk , and the edit - ing of a Syrian newspaper printed in Arabic !

		It took no very long time for him to realize that life among his own people , though in
America	LOCATION	, was not contributing to his under - standing of his adopted country , and he set forth upon a long odyssey , during which he acquired some formal education and actually taught himself the gift of fluent speaking and preaching in English by assiduous lecturing , often in churches and Sunday-schools .

		The difficulties that attended his upward march are not set forth with any fullness , but enough is told to make it quite apparent that he had a much harder time than his good taste per - mits him to disclose .

		At last , to his surprise , he was asked to accept a pastorate in a west - ern church , not to preach dogma , though he had betaken himself from
Greek Orthodoxy	ORGANIZATION	to an unrigorous Protestantism before leaving
Syria	LOCATION	, but to set forth religion as learned from the mouth of Jesus himself in the Gospels .

		It is a marvellous recital , this bridging of the thousands of years that separate
Turkey	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, and one that every true American can read with almost as great a pride as the teller of the story must feel .

		In a sleepy corner of
France	LOCATION	A
summer	DATE	tramp P in southwestern most remote from the present scene of Anglo-Franco-German strife , and months before the first mutterings of the coming storm , three British pedes - trians , with knapsacks on their backs , made a pilgrimage , during which they slept in well - nigh a score of wayside inns , saw not a single city , and met scarcely half a dozen persons who could speak a word of anything but the native idiom . ''

		Vagabonds in Perigord '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
H. H. Bashford	PERSON	, is a book whose pages fairly shimmer with the heat of that midsummer tramp through
Correze	LOCATION	and
Dordogne	LOCATION	and Gironde the fa - tigues of the journey as well as its delights figuring prominently in the intimate narrative of the tramp-historian .

		The author ,
Sophronia	PERSON	his wife , and
Justin	PERSON	the visionary , make up the party , although of the corporeality of
Justin	PERSON	one is left in strong doubt at the end , where it is written : `` But to tell the truth we had both become a little tired of
Justin	LOCATION	; and we resolved to slay him as we had re - solved to slay him so many times before .

		For what was he , after all , but a mood to be now and then inhabited a poor husk of a fellow , always chasing just a yard or two behind life ?

		So we watched him fade until presently we could see the star or two that he had been blotting , and the remote lamp of a steamer outward bound . ''

		Peacefully bucolic though the book 's atmosphere is , there is one jangling note where
Justin	PERSON	broaches at the dinner - table the subject of the proposed three-years military service , and further urges that the enlightened of all nations are really brethren for whom frontier boundary lines have ceased to exist .

		`` But if
Justin	PERSON	had believed this to be an olive-branch , it was his last and greatest error ... They slapped their foreheads .

		Was war of the intellect ?

		They smote their waist - coats .

		It was an affaire de cceur .

		For any man with sensibilities higher in grade than a potato 's , there were conditions , they yelled , under which death was infinitely preferable to life such conditions as had always ren -
1914	DATE	THE DIAL 303 dered , and to the world 's end would still render , the declaration of war a never-out-of - sight liability . ''

		Thus was the fiery
Gascon	PERSON	blood seen to boil up even in peaceful
Peri	LOCATION	- gord .

		Mr.
Bashford	PERSON	is an artist in light and humorous narrative ; also an artist with his pencil , as shown , if we mistake not , in the pleasing cover-design to his book and in the old-fashioned map , half topography , half quaint illustration , that is printed on the end leaves and bears his initials in one corner .

		In the land of perpetual revolution .

		Compared with the stern reality of the present European con - flict it is little more than a comic-opera warfare that Mr.
John Reed	PERSON	, war correspondent in the rebellion-torn republic to the south of us , pictures in his peculiarly jaunty manner in the volume entitled `` Insur - gent
Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		When , for in - stance , the Federal commander at
Zacatecas City	LOCATION	telegraphs to General
Velasco	PERSON	at
Torreon	LOCATION	his brilliant scheme of letting the Constitu - tionalists take the city and then recapturing it from them because it is an easier place to attack than to defend , how can such tactics be regarded seriously as illustrations of orthodox military science ?

		In the following excerpt we get a glimpse of the foremost Constitu - tionalist general recreating himself after his arduous duties at the front .

		The scene is an improvised bull ring .

		`` Villa would walk right up to the pawing , infuriated animal , and , with his double cape , slap him insolently across the face , and , for half an hour , would follow the greatest sport I ever saw .

		Some - times the sawed-off horns of the bull would catch Villa in the seat of the trousers and propel him violently across the ring ; then he would turn and grab the bull by the head and wrestle with him with the sweat streaming down his face until five or six companeros seized the bull 's tail and hauled him plowing and bellowing back . ''

		In striking contrast with the rollicking boyishness and rough-and - ready forcefulness of `` Pancho '' Villa are the pompous ineffectually and wooden stiffness of the nominal commander-in-chief ,
Venusti	PERSON	- ano Carranza , as he appears to us in Mr.
Reed	PERSON	's pages , holding himself aloof in an absurd unapproachability , surrounded and guarded from molestation by officious cabinet members and other diplomatic gentlemen , and all the while leaving `` Villa strictly alone , to undergo defeats if he must , or make mistakes ; so much so that
Villa	ORGANIZATION	himself was forced to deal with foreign powers as if he were the head of the government . ' '

		The book helps one to understand recent developments in the mutual relations of these two men , and at the same time conveys vivid and presumably truthful impressions of Mexican life and Mex - ican people in the midst of rebellion .

		The popular Professor
E. G. Cox	PERSON	has per - formed a welcome service in turning into English the val - uable work of the Danish scholar , Dr.
Johannes Steenstrup	PERSON	, on the ballad , now issued from the press of
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title of `` The Medieval Popular Ballad . ''

		This vol - ume first appeared at
Copenhagen	LOCATION	in *
1891	DATE	, and has Avon general recognition among scholars .

		It is based on
Grundtvig	ORGANIZATION	's famous collection of Danish ballads a collection larger even than that of our own Professor Child but it is nevertheless of considerable importance to the English student by reason of the light that it reflects on the history and nature of the English ballad .

		The prime aim of Dr.
Steenstrup	PERSON	was to ascertain and set forth the main characteristics of the ballad as it originally flourished in
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		Inci - dentally he endeavors to bring out certain spurious elements that have crept into the ballad in more modern times or that are to be found in certain ballads of comparatively recent origin which had erroneously been ad - mitted into the canon by
Grundtvig	ORGANIZATION	.

		His conclusions with respect to the origin and nature of the Danish ballad are in striking accord with the views now generally accepted with respect to the English ballad .

		The Danish ballad , he shows , is remarkable first of all for its objectivity ; it had its origin in songs of the folk accompanied by dancing ; it is extremely fond of the refrain ; it is crude and irregular both in its rhythms and in its rhymes ; it is averse to alliteration as an organic element , but employs parallelism oc - casionally , and is fond of repetition ; it avoids nature except for purposes of background ; it abhors didactic elements and abstractions of every sort ; it is incomparably plain and simple in its style .

		The ballad first flourished in
Denmark	LOCATION	, so Dr.
Steenstrup	PERSON	concludes , in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries .

		One is impressed throughout with the frankness and earnestness displayed by this Danish scholar .

		The style of Professor Cox 's transla - tion is admirably lucid and forthright , and it is perfect in its idiom .

		The ancient civilizations of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		`` Mexican Archaeology : An In - troduction to the Archaeology of the Mexican and
Mayan Civili	PERSON	- zations of Pre-Spanish America '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a fat octavo volume filled with illustrations and containing a useful map , which Mr.
Thomas A. Joyce	PERSON	has prepared for the use of 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	students .

		It is filled to bursting with facts , solid , substantial , undeniable facts , carrying the knowledge the world has been able to recover of the lost civilizations of
Mexico	LOCATION	down to the most recent discoveries .

		As an instance of the German method of thorough - ness in this field , the author says in his Preface , `` the torch has passed to
Germany	LOCATION	'' it deserves all praise ; as a specimen of literature it is perhaps more readable than an unabridged dictionary .

		Its appeal is to the student , interested in facts ; to the casual reader who wishes a running account of these elder Americans that will hold his atten - tion and give him in reasonable space the truth about them , it is hard reading .

		Take the question of Aztec cannibalism , which pre - vious writers have led us to suppose was the usual sequence of the offering of human vic - tims to the gods .

		It is rather important , if we are to form an idea of the civilization of the ancient Mexican .

		Mr.
Joyce	PERSON	mentions it , rather casually , in only two places , thus : `` Sacrifice was sometimes accompanied by cannibalism '' -LRB- p. 67 -RRB- . ''

		The very cannibalism which , to a limited extent , formed the occa - sional sequel to human sacrifice , becomes di - vested of much of its horror when it is remem - bered that the rite was , in essentials , an act of communion with the deity , with whom the victim was identified '' -LRB- p. 82 -RRB- .

		This does not appear to cover the ground adequately , and gives rise to a suspicion that , like Pres - cott the historian and
Wallace	PERSON	the romancer , the author desires to gloss over the darkest chapter in Aztec annals .

		This impression remains after finishing the book .

		The ' ' civili - zation '' described was a red Indian savagery , dominated by gross superstitions from which more northern tribes were comparatively free .

		The Aztecs were pueblo Indians whose per - formances in the arts should not be allowed to blind the modern mind to the realities of their daily life and worship .

		An observer Americans have seldom been of immigrants given a better chance to see to
America	LOCATION	.

		, i .

		, , , themselves as others see them than in the interesting view given of portions of the country by Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	in `` With Poor Immigrants to
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		We could wish for our own sakes that Mr.
Graham	PERSON	had not had the experiences so picturesquely set forth in his previous work , `` With the Russian Pilgrims to
Jerusa	PERSON	- lem , '' since the contrast with Russian spir - ituality in its most self-sacrificing mood is more than a little hard on American material - ism .

		The author took passage from
England	LOCATION	in the steerage , and there met all sorts and conditions of about-to-be Americans .

		This he followed by tramping from
New York	LOCATION	to Chi - cago with means to pay his way .

		His impres - sions are gained by personal contact , and not by reading , and they are as interesting to read as they must have been to undergo .

		Mr.
Gra	PERSON	- ham is sympathetic with our endeavors to better the conditions of those who come among us from European shores , but hardly as sym - pathetic as he is with the Russian immigrants whose fellows he had learned to admire in his earlier journeyings through their great em - pire and down to the Holy Land .

		But he is fair , and he leans always toward constructive criticism .

		An instance of the shrewdness of his observation may be given : After discrim - inating between `` the great multifarious , un - formed mass of the people '' and `` the strong , emancipated , cultured American nation , '' he goes on to describe `` the fat American , clever enough to bluff even the Jew the strange emerging bourgeois type of what I call the ` white nigger , ' low-browed , heavy-cheeked , thick-lipped , huge-bodied , but white ; men who seem made of rubber so elastic they are ; men who seem to get their thoughts from below upward ... On the whole , the dry , lean Americans are the most trustworthy and honorable among the masses of the people .

		In
England	LOCATION	we trust fat men , men ` who sleep o ' nights , ' but in
America	LOCATION	one prefers the lean man .

		... Of course too much stress might easily be laid on the unpleasantness of the ` white-nigger ' type .

		There are plenty of them who are true gentlemen . ''

		This is as hard upon the American negro of the better sort as it is upon the fat man , of course , but it is given from a foreign point of view and is suggestive of more than it says .

		This is gen - erally true of the book , which is admirably written and decorated with bite of natural description truly poetic in feeling .

		The fair sex Personal experience and obser - in the land of vation in the land of the Pha - whs - raohs form the basis of Mrs.
Elizabeth Cooper	PERSON	's varied and instructive chapters entitled , collectively , `` The Women of
Egypt	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , but covering a far wider range of topics than this title would indicate ; for the manners and customs , the religion and the superstitions , the industries and the amusements , of the people in general are de - scribed or touched upon in the course of the book , while a multitude of illustrations of all sorts emphasizes the volume 's pleasing variety .

		Recording little but what she herself has seen or has heard from the natives , Mrs.
Cooper	PERSON	inspires confidence in her trustworthiness as a writer on present-day conditions in the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 305 country visited by her with the express pur - pose , as she says , of trying `` to learn some - thing of the life of the Egyptian woman .

		I did not expect , '' she adds , `` to fully under - stand her , but I wanted to know as much as is possible for a woman of that hurrying , bustling , new country ,
America	LOCATION	, to know of the slow , lethargic woman of the Orient .

		I realized that the foundation of our knowledge of a people must be an understanding of their country , for social structure depends primarily upon labour , and labour is determined by place . ''

		To the part played by the shut-in woman of the harem is ascribed an exag - gerated importance , it must seem to many readers , by this friendly and sympathetic observer , who even begins her book with these words : `` As go the women of
Egypt	LOCATION	, so goes
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		And yet she herself admits the in - security of woman 's place in the Egyptian household and hence in the larger social scheme .

		Divorces are the rule and not the exception , the husband having the right to put away his wife and try a new one for no sufficient cause , as well as the privilege of plural wives up to the prescribed
Mohamme	PERSON	- dan limit .

		But there are signs of better things in the future for the patient women of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		England 's administration seems to tend to their uplifting , and the education of girls is there making fine headway .

		One can not wish to see orientalism rudely ousted by occi - dentalism , but rather some needed reforms introduced in the old order .

		That this process is now going on among the women of
Egypt	LOCATION	becomes apparent from a reading of Mrs.
Cooper	PERSON	's excellent account of her extended sojourn in that country .

		The adventurous ^ ost opportune and worthy of men who have high praise is Mr.
F. Lauriston le8	PERSON	-
Bullard	PERSON	's `` Famous War Corre - spondents '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The pro- found interest commanded by the greatest war in history , coupled with the meagreness of the details of its battles , has called especial attention not only to the present task of war correspondents but to their past achieve - ments .

		The place of honor is here rightly given to Sir
William Howard Russell	PERSON	, whose dispatches from the
Crimea	LOCATION	changed the thought of a nation and caused the fall of a British government .

		Thereafter appear valu - able judgments upon
Archibald Forbes	PERSON	,
Janu	PERSON	- arius
Aloysius MacGahan	PERSON	,
Frederick Villiers	PERSON	-LRB- still alive and sketching near the front to - day -RRB- ,
Bennet Burleigh	PERSON	,
Edmond ` Donovan	PERSON	, the five Vizetellys ,
Edward Frederick Knight	PERSON	, the lamented
George Warrington Steevens	PERSON	,
Winston Spencer Churchill	PERSON	-LRB- now first lord of the admiralty -RRB- , and
James Creelman	PERSON	.

		It would be difficult to select modern careers as interesting in the fullest sense of the word as several of these , even from among those who fought rather than described fighting .

		There follows a most interesting and unexpected chapter on
George Wilkins Kendall	PERSON	and his fellow-correspondents of the war with
Mexico	LOCATION	in 1846-7 , wherein it is conclusively demon - strated that the free press of
America	LOCATION	was the first to recognize and utilize the services of reporters in the field .

		The concluding chap - ters are devoted , respectively , to the work done by Americans in the Civil War and in the Spanish-American War .

		The Preface mentions the names of many more who might have been included had the size of the book permitted , while the treatment accorded those mentioned justifies their exclusion .

		It makes a better book for detailing the history of these than it could have been if there had been a larger inclusion with the meagre sketchiness necessarily ensuing .

		Portraits of all the men mentioned are used as illustra - tions .

		The latest addition to the The political .

		, , career of Heroes of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	series is devoted to `` Demosthenes and the Last Days of Greek Freedom '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author is Mr.
A. W. Pickard-Cambridge	PERSON	of
Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	; and his work has been well done .

		In such a series there must be a little temptation now and then to make one 's theme fit harmoniously into the general plan ; but in the present instance Demos - thenes is treated with an unflinching hand .

		Of course he was an orator before he was a statesman , and he was often a politician after he became a statesman ; he had many obvious weaknesses , which are not blinked by the author ; but after all he was the protagonist , the hero , in the tragic conflict against the rising power of Philip of
Macedonia	LOCATION	.

		And what a drama it makes , the course of events from the Peace of Antalcidas -LRB- 387-6 -RRB- to the battle of Chaeroneia -LRB- 338 -RRB- .

		Naturally the supreme tragedy is the travail and defeat of
Athens	LOCATION	; but even after
Chaeroneia	LOCATION	there is scarcely less tragedy in the struggle and death of her foremost champion sixteen years later .

		And it must be a stout-hearted imperialist , indeed , who can study this period without strange flutterings about the heart .

		The present reviewer , certainly , who has worked in this field for many years , must confess that he laid aside the present studious and unemotional treatise with a feeling unpar - donably akin to tears .

		It is a pleasure to commend the volume to intelligent readers who would care to follow `` the last struggle 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	of the Hellenes for liberty and the part played by Demosthenes in that struggle '' in a book that is thoroughly sane and represents scholar - ship without pedantry .

		It ought to be noted that there are twenty-nine illustrations , in - cluding an excellent map , and , in addition , a convenient chronological table , a fair bibli - ography in the prefatory note , and an index that proved reliable in so far as it was tested .

		Fro .

		** estimates Jt ls n0t th f CUSt0nl f ^ ly of forty promi - newspapers here or anywhere else to furnish intelligent and frank estimates of character in the form of personality sketches .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	we often attack a millionaire or a prophet and we often provide him with a halo ; we almost never attempt the thing between .

		The French newspaper writers are more skilful at writing personality sketches , but their journalism is more partisan than our own .

		The English are very like us .

		Mr.
A. C. Gardiner	PERSON	's collec - tion of articles from the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily News , '' entitled `` Pillars of Society '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is therefore something of a sur - prise to those who did not see his previous volume , `` Prophets , Priests , and Kings . ''

		It consists of forty frank views , each illustrated by a photograph , of prominent persons from Sir
Edward Carson	PERSON	to
Prince Kropotkin	PERSON	, and from the
Jam Sahib of Nawanagar to Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	is doubtless more of a party man than appears to the American reader not too familiar with English politics , but , granted that his bias is toward Mrs.
Despard	PERSON	rather than toward Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	and toward Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	rather than toward Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	, he seems an uncommonly fair man , with a catholic taste in personality , and he writes very well .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Miss
Jesse Bonstelle	PERSON	and
Miss Marian de Forest	ORGANIZATION	have found little matter of importance for '' Little Women Letters from the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Alcott '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , but they have made a book which vividly recalls the creator of '' Little Women . ''

		Two facsimiles of letters from
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	to his daughter ,
Louisa May Alcott	PERSON	, and one of a letter to another daughter , are included .

		Three new volumes of the `` Loeb Classical Library '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have recently come to hand .

		The two in the Latin section are Vol .

		II .

		of Sue - tonius , which completes `` The Lives of the Caesars '' and '' The Lives of Illustrious Men , '' and
Cicero	PERSON	's '' De Fiuibus Bonorum Et Malorum '' ; the one in the Greek section is the first volume of a two - volume edition of Xenophon 's '' Cyropasdia . ''

		... 348 THE YOUNGER GENERATION .

		The younger generation has been slow to declare itself in
America	LOCATION	.

		Persons of an equable cynicism deny its existence .

		Those who conceive themselves to be making a last stand for the judiciary , the home , and
Victo	PERSON	- rian literature have no doubt about it ; and neither have the young poets who imagine they have in vented `` poly-rhythmics , `` nor the young idealists who believe that the
Indus	LOCATION	- trial Workers of the World are about to estab - lish the only true democracy .

		We find it difficult to cite names and titles as evidence that a new generation has begun to define and record itself in American literature .

		Among novelists , Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	hardly belongs to either the older or the younger generation .

		His career can be un - derstood only as the career of a man who has been caught between two generations so that he is handicapped by his sympathies with both .

		Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	is almost as much a European as Mr.
James	PERSON	; at any rate she is a good deal less an American than Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells ; but , like him , she has chiefly studied a society that is passing rather than one that is just coming in .

		Mr.
Theodore Dreiser	PERSON	is quite definitely placed by an accident of his youth .

		He discovered the realist idea in fic - tion and post-Darwinian materialism at the same time , or about twenty years after Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	wrote `` A Mummer 's Wife . ''

		His long struggle to secure the publication of `` Sister Carrie '' confirmed him in that posi - tion , so that the only youthful quality he now possesses is the one which makes him think it worth while to spend himself in opposing American ideas of propriety in fiction .

		None of these three , certainly , is as clearly of the younger generation as is Mr.
Arthur Bullard	PERSON	, the author of `` A Man 's World '' and `` Com - rade
Yetta	PERSON	. ''

		It is his distinction that with - out being a propagandist , he is thoroughly at home with the emotions and the personalities of radicalism ; and that without being him - self the son of foreign-born parents , he is able to envisage
America	LOCATION	as a country inhab - ited by others than
New Englanders	LOCATION	.

		But there is scarcely a single young novelist to THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	say nothing of a group whom we can place beside him .

		So far , he is an isolated case .

		The poets are more controversial than the novelists ; it really matters to them whether one believes in
Tennyson	LOCATION	or in Mr.
Ezra	PERSON	Pound ; but the younger ones have written very little so far .

		The theatre offers no more evidence of a younger generation than poetry .

		Mr.
Edward Sheldon	PERSON	, for instance , belongs to a new time as little as Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	.

		Journalism is , perhaps , more promising than imaginative literature .

		Just now the names of several able young men are linked by the announcement of a weekly paper , ' ' The New Republic , ' ' which proposes to criti - cize politics , education , and the arts .

		Mr.
Herbert Croly	PERSON	, the editor , wrote his book , '' The Promise of American Life , '' from the point of view of a man who feels that the only society worth having would be one in which individuality had the opportunity to develop freely .

		He believes that we have sacrificed that opportunity to economic efficiency .

		Mr.
Walter Lippmann	PERSON	, just out of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and the Socialist party , is impatient of current writing about politics and political theory .

		He pointed out , patiently enough , in his `` A Preface to Politics , '' that our American faith in statutes is not at all justified by re - sults , that to reject syndicalism because it proposes violence is to ignore both its motive and its object , and that to write an elaborate report on vice without discussing the chief force involved is to accomplish very little .

		Mr.
Francis Hackett	PERSON	has , we believe , never written a book .

		But he was the hero of an unusual journalistic exploit .

		Five or six years ago , Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	discov - ered the enormous gap between the reviews in
Chicago	LOCATION	newspapers and those in
London	LOCATION	, papers like the `` Nation , '' the `` New Age , '' and the `` Times Literary Supplement , '' and founded the ``
Friday	DATE	Literary Review '' of the
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Evening Post . ''

		The experiment , in its originally effective form , was aban - doned nearly two years ago .

		But while it lasted
Chicago	LOCATION	had the opportunity to read in a daily newspaper criticism which endeav - ored to apply the standards and the methods of
London	LOCATION	weekly journalism .

		Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	was genial about it , yet he had his fling at the pillars of the American novel while he intro - duced
Chesterton	LOCATION	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Wells	LOCATION	, and
Bennett	PERSON	to a public which would have been much less appreciative of them without his assistance .

		But the possible list of American writers of the younger generation is nearly exhausted .

		And the few men we have mentioned may not be as promising as they seem .

		Mr.
Bullard	PERSON	may never write a better novel than `` A Man 's World , '' or even another one as good .

		Mr.
Croly	PERSON	, Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hackett	PERSON	may already have made their contributions , and not merely prepared the way for them .

		Why is the list so short ?

		Mr.
Croly	PERSON	would say that in
America	LOCATION	we have no tradition of free intellectual discus - sion .

		The newspapers , the magazines , and even the universities are afraid of the public ; their concern not to offend the majority com - mits them to the accepted view and prohibits iconoclasm .

		The result is that the younger generation faces not only all the handicaps it everywhere suffers , but also a well-supported taboo .

		The older generation holds all the van - tage points the editorships , the professorial chairs , the official positions which have naturally fallen to it .

		That is a matter of course .

		But its success in suppressing the militant minority is peculiarly American .

		As one of the younger men put it the other day , `` It is not that we have nothing to say , or that we do not know how to say it .

		It is that we have no place in which to say it . ' '

		The question whether that bitter statement of the case is any more true of the
United States	LOCATION	than it is of
England	LOCATION	or of
Russia	LOCATION	is perhaps irrelevant .

		There is enough truth in it to give it poignancy .

		For none of us would , in the abstract , deny youth a place in which `` to say it , '' however coldly we might regard its desire to say a particular thing in a par - ticular place .

		The spectacle of youth strug - gling to give itself is sometimes comic ; but it is always a moving and , so far as its meaning can be read , a significant spectacle .

		The intelligent , therefore , regard such pa - pers as `` The Masses , '' `` The New Review , '' and `` The International '' with an interest out of all proportion to their achievement and probably with an interest out of all propor - tion to any rewards that have so far accrued to it .

		They await the first issues of `` The New Republic '' as impatiently as if they had not been many times disappointed .

		They watch for a new novelist or a new poet with as much concern as astronomers hoping to find a new star in the heavens .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 325 SOME AMERICAN PICTURES IN THE , METROPOLITAN MUSEUM .

		American contemporary art has come more into the open , has attracted more of the at - tention of the world , .

		than our recent work in literature , music , or architecture .

		Pictures speak a universal language , they are not in - volved in the confusion of tongues .

		On the other hand they are somewhat stationary and not easy to multiply .

		Many of our best artists , however , have invaded
Europe	LOCATION	, and their suc - cess has reflected a consequence on the whole body of our art .

		School it can hardly be called .

		There have been the beginnings of schools among us , but our artists generally have taken their technique and aims from foreign masters , and often their themes from foreign life or scenes , so that there is not the family resemblance between them which we see in the great Italian and Dutch schools , or even in the English and French .

		The
New York	LOCATION	Metropolitan Museum is ex - traordinarily rich in good examples of Ameri - can art , though there are many artists un - represented who might well be in evidence , and though some of those present are not shown by their best work .

		The collection , however , gives a fair idea of our achievement in painting .

		Of course our wealth of work in mural decoration must be sought for else - where .

		Historically , the collection starts with our American primitives .


Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	,
Charles W. Peale	PERSON	,
Thomas Sully	PERSON	,
Henry Inman	PERSON	, and
John Neagle	PERSON	.

		We might call this the brick - dust school ; and there has surely been noth - ing like it in art before or since , unless the pictures on our magazine covers keep up its traditions .

		The brilliancy of the ladies ' com - plexions , the floridness of the men 's , the glit - ter of their noses , and the solidity of color in their clothes , startle and amaze .

		But the col - ors are laid on well ; these portraits will re - tain their bloom for ages .

		Of all these artists Sully was the best .

		He had some idea of tone and much grace of drawing .

		There is an allegorical picture by
Benjamin	PERSON	`` West notice - able for one or two beautiful heads .

		And there is a picture by
Washington Allston	LOCATION	, `` The Deluge , '' reminiscent of
Poussin	LOCATION	.

		It is in the opposite extreme from the cheerfulness of portrait painters a wall of gloom , with some scattered driftwood , drowned men , and eel-like serpents on the foreground .

		There is apparently nothing then until we come to
John Kensett	PERSON	.

		His `` Hudson River '' is faithful but prosaic .

		The `` JEgean Sea '' of
F. E. Church	ORGANIZATION	is pure , ideal landscape .

		It is a trifle theatrical perhaps , indicative of the Byronic backwash , but it is undeniably beauti - ful .

		And beauty which does not have to be argued about , or explained , or a taste culti - vated for it , is rare enough in art .

		Some of
Thomas Cole	PERSON	's work also has this ante-modern note .

		These pictures strive for distinction .

		The modern note is struck in
Eastman Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's `` Two Men , '' which aims mainly at sincerity .

		It is a strongly painted piece of realism , the realism which does not demand low themes or repulsive types .

		Perhaps there is a somewhat similar con - trast of aim between
Alexander Wyant	PERSON	's `` An Old Clearing '' and
Worthington Whittredge	PERSON	's `` Evening in the Woods . ''

		Wyant 's picture is absolutely true and faithful .

		But it is a trifle cold , untouched with emotion ; whereas
Whittredge	PERSON	's landscape is not only rich in tone but is flooded with sentiment .

		We get a combination of the real and the ideal in
George Inness	PERSON	.

		His `` Autumn Oaks '' and ``
Delaware Valley	LOCATION	, '' though small in scale , can stand comparison with the work of
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Diaz	PERSON	.

		His great `` Evening '' is unique and has tremendous qualities .

		The elements of the picture are simple , a mass of shadowy ground and foliage against the still glowing evening sky .

		This is a work of con - centration .

		His `` Peace and Plenty , '' how - ever , is a huge , scattered thing .

		It is hardly more than a piece of topography , and not very good topography at that , for the central group of trees must be about three hundred feet high .

		With the `` Evening '' of Inness may be com - pared and contrasted Mr.
Ralph Blakelock	PERSON	's `` Pipe Dancers . ''

		It is thoroughly American in scene and subject : Indians , clothed in red , are dancing in the twilight which is growing up around them , while overhead between long lines of trees a rich sunset is fading away .

		We have some doubt as to whether the top and bottom of the picture quite synchronize , as they do in that of Inness .

		With less grasp of reality than
Inness	PERSON	,
George Fuller	PERSON	carried the power of sugges - tion to an even higher degree .

		He does not go quite so far as the old tapestry work described by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, `` And for Achilles ' image stood his spear , '' but a full meaning is brought out by the slightest means .

		His `` Nydia '' is a slender girl with flesh tints lighted by an un - usual glare , fascinating in her air of expecta - tion .

		In `` And She Was a Witch '' a whole drama is brought out in the shadow by half - hinted figure the richly attired woman shrinking under the trees , the passers-by with scornfully averted looks .

		And this is not `` literary '' painting .

		Fuller 's technique 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	seems to have been self-originated , unless there is in it a far-off reflection of Rembrandt .

		The whole question of `` the subject '' in painting is brought up by
E. A. Abbey	ORGANIZATION	's large picture `` King Lear . ''

		Against the telling of stories in paint may be urged the fact that these stories have to be known or explained .

		A work of art , we may think , ought to be an intelligible whole in itself ; it ought not to have to hang on to some book or tradition or invention foreign to its own resources .

		It is quite certain , however , that , in the great ages of art , painters were best satisfied to tell sto - ries or illustrate religious or secular themes .

		The mere landscapist or portraitist was of secondary account .

		And to-day our great new school of mural artists paint allegories of their own invention which have to be ex - plained .

		They seem to think that , granting the necessary technical equipment , the more thought and meaning you can put into a pic - ture the better .

		We think that
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	's work justifies `` the subject . ''

		It is rich in tone , magnificent in pattern , and the attitudes , ges - tures , and faces of the principal figures are most expressive and illumining .

		``
William M. Hunt	PERSON	has two single figure pic - tures which , if we remember rightly , are designs for one of his wall paintings .

		These figures are modelled with remarkable smooth - ness of painting and are intended to show clearly at a distance .


John La Farge	ORGANIZATION	is represented by a beauti - fully harmonized piece of color , `` The Muse of Painting . ''

		It gives one somewhat of the impression of a poem by
Keats	PERSON	.

		That other American colorist , Mr.
Albert P. Ryder	PERSON	, has two small pieces , `` The Bridge '' and `` Smug - glers ' Cove , '' which , though good , hardly give the measure of his remarkable talent .

		Mr.
Theodore Robinson	PERSON	's `` Girl and Cow '' is very French of the `` plein-air '' school .

		Mr.
Jonas Lie	PERSON	's `` The Conqueror '' is a pic - ture of the
Culebra	LOCATION	cut ,
Panama	LOCATION	, but as far as truth to nature is concerned probably more closely resembles one of the canals in Mars .

		It is a purely symbolical picture , as much so as Mr.
Arthur B. Davies	PERSON	's frank allegory `` The Girdle of Ares '' on a near wall .

		There is a female study by Mr.
Abbot H. Thayer	PERSON	of the same type as his ' ' Virgin ' ' and the `` Woman and Child '' in the
Boston	LOCATION	Mu - seum .

		A large ideality looks out of his pic - tures , yet they have an abundance of physical life .

		Mr.
Alphonse Jonglewis	PERSON	's `` Louise '' strik - ingly recalls
Whistler	LOCATION	's portrait of Miss
Alex	PERSON	- ander .

		It is not so simple and austere as that masterpiece , but we think the beflowered hat lights up the figure wonderfully .

		We are not so sure about the parrot .

		Mr.
Childe Hassam	PERSON	's picture reveals an in - dividual view of nature all strong light or shadow left out , but , as in
Corot	LOCATION	, the values true in their condensed scale .


Homer Martin	PERSON	is one of our best land - scapists , and his work with the line of slender trees recalls
Hobbema	LOCATION	.

		It is not pleasant to be always noting resemblances , but Mr.
Thomas W. Dewing	PERSON	's `` The Letter '' is an Americanized Vermeer .

		Mr.
Frederick W. Waugh	PERSON	's two pictures , ' ' The Great Deep ' ' and `` The Roaring Forties , '' open-sea paintings of great power , are original enough .

		So too is
Robert MacCameron	PERSON	's `` The Daughter 's Re - turn , '' which is almost the last word in squalid realism , but painted with great conviction .

		We now come to the major gods of the col - lection , or , first , to one who is at least a
Titan	ORGANIZATION	.

		The four or five pictures of
Winslow Homer	ORGANIZATION	, which are hung together , smite the eyes like a revelation .

		We can not say that we have ever seen foam without air in it , as in these white walls and crawling lines of white , but prob - ably this simplification is intentional .

		A sim - ilar treatment of broken water is given in the `` Shooting the Rapids '' in another room .

		What Homer aimed to render was the force and instantaneousness of water in violent mo - tion .

		Compare his treatment with that of Mr.
Paul Dougherty	PERSON	in `` Surf . ''

		Here the foam is piled in soft mounds of snow , sunlight smitten , or withdraws in transparent green lines .

		Mr.
Dougherty	PERSON	gives more facts than Homer and they are beautifully assembled , but the chief facts of all , the fury of the charg - ing sea and the indomitable defence of the rocks , are in Homer 's pictures rather than in his .

		Homer 's `` Gulf Stream '' is painted , one may say , in the grand style .

		There is an accu - mulation of horrors in it , but it fascinates ; it establishes that invisible tether which every really remarkable picture attaches to the spec - tator , drawing him back to it again and again .

		Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	and
Whistler	LOCATION	are of course the trump cards of this American collection , but the Museum has not been particularly fortu - nate in securing first-rate examples of either .

		Mr.
Sargent	PERSON	's portrait of Mr.
William Chase	PERSON	is a brilliant work .

		The figure bristles with vi - tality and seems to have been done with a few swirls of the brush .

		The head of the ' '
Gitana	PERSON	' ' is profoundly painted , but the rest of the pic - ture is naught .

		As for the `` Hermit '' we con - fess we give up any attempt to understand it .

		The hermit seems to have been flayed and his cuticle distributed over the landscape .

		The picture does not hold together from any point of view .

		It might have been painted in a
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 327 world where there are four or five different colored suns whirling above the horizon at once .

		What sentiment of reverence or irrever - ence inspired the painting of the Hermit him - self , who pops up like an emaciated earthworm from a hole in the lower corner of the picture , we shall probably never know .

		Whistler 's `` Lady of the Yellow
Buskin	PERSON	`` in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	is a great picture .

		His portraits of his mother and of
Carlyle	PERSON	are truth itself , albeit so quiet and unemphasized .

		But the three portraits in the
New York	LOCATION	Museum are questionable things .

		The elimination of the non-essential was
Whistler	LOCATION	's guiding rule .

		But flesh and blood are surely essential to good portrait painting .

		The `` Connie Gilchrist '' and the `` Henry Irving '' are ghosts , graceful and charming ghosts , for whom we may be grateful , but certainly not human beings .

		The
M. Duret	PERSON	is alive , though hardly more so than a large tinted photograph would be .


Meier	PERSON	-
Graefe	PERSON	says that this gentleman has no bones and is held up by his trousers .

		Whistler is said to have painted it , in a sort of wager with himself , to show that modern male attire could be made interesting .

		He compromised , however , with the lady 's cloak which
M. Duret	PERSON	is carrying , and which is surely no more a part of his personality than a toga or Elizabethan trunks would be . ' '

		Cremorne Garden No. 2 '' isi a company of fashionably attired ghosts taking the air in some absolutely undefined region .

		It may be objected that we have no right to ask an artist for more than he chooses to give us that if we get grace , refinement , charm , as we do in all these pictures of
Whistler	LOCATION	, we ought to be satisfied .

		So we ought , if the artist is content with the rank which these qualities give him .

		But
Whistler	LOCATION	acclaimed himself , and has been acclaimed by others , the equal of the mightiest ; and so we have the right to say that , compared with the work of the great men , these particular pictures are mere washed-out prettinesses .

		Nor have we ever been able much to believe in his `` Nocturnes . ''

		Rembrandt painted not with colors but with the primal fire and darkness of the world .

		But he never allowed his fire to be swallowed up by his darkness .

		His subject and figures are always made out .

		That anything is made out in
Whistler	LOCATION	's `` Nocturne in Green and Gold , '' we very much doubt .

		Inness ,
Fuller	ORGANIZATION	,
Homer	ORGANIZATION	,
Sargent	LOCATION	, and Whis - tler , these seem to be the high notes in Amer - ican painting , at least as revealed in this col - lection .

		Poet souls the first two , who on the dark ages of our art wrought out visions of lasting beauty .

		A veritable Thor the third , who really does take the kingdom of art by violence .

		The fourth is a wizard of paint , complete in knowledge and dexterity , yet somehow failing to impress us with any cen - tral greatness .

		The last is a delicate handed chemist , who , from the full flasks of older masters ,
Courbet	LOCATION	, the Japanese ,
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, and
Velasquez	PERSON	, distilled volatile and vaporous essences of his own which have magic in them .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		MR.
EDWARD CARPENTER	PERSON	'S OPTIMISM , as re - vealed in his reply to the recent notable address presented to him on the occasion of his seventieth birthday , constitutes a cheering refutation of the scriptural assertion that the modicum of strength left to a man after he has reached the three-score-and-ten limit is but labor and sorrow .

		Thinker , social re - former , poet , author , beloved of our own
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, Mr.
Carpenter	PERSON	in no wise disap - points expectation in the ringing , courageous , high-hearted tone of this memorable utter - ance , in the course of which he says : `` The enormous growth during the past few years of democratic and commfrmal thought and or - ganization on the Continent generally is well - known , and the events of which we are speaking have suddenly crystallized into that definite consciousness and into a fresh resolve for the future the resolve that never again shall the peoples be plunged in the senseless bloodshed of war to suit the ambitions or the private interests of ruling classes . ' '

		Further : ' ' The new order thus arriving will largely be the outcome of those - years of work all over
Europe	LOCATION	in which the ideal of a generous com - mon life has been preached and propagated as against the sordid and self-seeking com - mercialism of the era that is passing away . ''

		Significantly autobiographical are these fur - ther words from the `` democratic author and poet , '' as he chooses to call himself : `` If in my small way I have done anything towards the social evolution of which I speak , it is , I think , chiefly due to the fact that I was born in the midst of that commercial era , and that , consequently , my early days were days of considerable suffering .

		Coming to my first consciousness , as it were , of the world at the age of sixteen -LRB- at
Brighton	LOCATION	in
1860	DATE	-RRB- , I found myself and without knowing where I was in the middle of that strange period of human evolution , the Victorian age , which , in some respects , one now thinks , marked the lowest ebb of modern civilized society : a period in which not only commercialism in public life , but cant in religion , pure materialism in sci - ence , futility in social conventions , the worship 328 THE DIAL .

		-LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	of stocks and shares , the starving of the human heart , the denial of the human body and its needs , the huddling concealment of the body in clothes , the ` impure hush ' on matters of sex , class-division , contempt of manual labor , and the cruel barring of womien from every natural and useful expression of their lives , were carried to an extremity of folly difficult now for us to realize . ''

		Evi - dently there is little of the laudator temporis acti in this forward-looking and serenely hope - ful poet and prophet of democracy .

		THE LITERATURE OF LITTLE NATIONS need not itself be small in quantity or inferior in qual - ity , as has been proved by many instances , despite the loud assertions of the
Bernhardi	LOCATION	school that culture of all kinds flourishes best in
States	LOCATION	maintaining a vast military estab - lishment .

		Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	eloquently es - pouses the cause of the smaller nations in a late timely utterance that has gained pub - licity in the daily press .

		In the course of his remarks he says : `` The small States whose absorption is now threatened have been a po - tent and useful perhaps the most potent and useful factor in the advance of civiliza - tion .

		It is in them and by them that most of what is most precious in religion , in philoso - phy , in literature , in science , and in art has been produced ... The Greeks were a small people , not united in one great State , but scattered over coasts and among hills in petty city communities , each with its own life .

		Slender in numbers , but eager , versatile , and intense , they gave us the richest , most varied , and most stimulating of all literatures .

		When poetry and art reappeared after the long night of the Dark Ages , their most splendid blossoms flowered in the small republics of
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Our debt to
Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, and the Scandinavian countries is pointed out , as also are the achievements of the little
Germany	LOCATION	of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's time and the little En - gland of
Shakespeare 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Already too great uniformity has been wrought by the great , dominant powers in a world that was for - merly so picturesquely varied in its thought and expression ; and any remotest prospect of one greedy and grasping nation 's being able arbitrarily to impose its will on greater and greater stretches of territory until the whole globe or even any considerable portion of it shall be but a visible embodiment of that will , is too dreary and too abhorrent for contem - plation .

		* BOOKS AD LIBITUM , or unrestricted borrow - ing privileges , seems to be the goal toward which public library practice is now progres - ing , following hard upon the heels of that freedom of the shelves which has emphasized so unmistakably the difference between the timid and suspicious library administration of the old days and the fearless and liberal policy of the present .

		Some libraries , notably that at
Trenton	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, lend books practically without limit in number to those asking for them in good faith and showing a disposition not to abuse their privileges .

		Others , as at
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, and
Williamsport	LOCATION	.


Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, are letting down the bars and relaxing former restrictions in a manner that speaks well for both the library management and the library users .

		In his seventh annual Report , Mr. 0 .


R. Howard Thomson	PERSON	of the last-named institution looks back with pardon - able complacency on things accomplished . ''

		Mystically , '' he says , `` seven is the symbol of perfection , and while no library can ever expect to attain to the beatitude of that myth - ical state , yet the past year having been the one that completed our first cycle of seven , it behooves us to look carefully over that which we have done . ''

		And a little later , touching on the subject here under consideration , he continues : `` The opinion of many librarians that the restriction of borrowing privileges , to two books at one time , exerted an injurious influence on the character of the volumes drawn for home use , caused the
Board	ORGANIZATION	to authorize a change in the rules .

		Hereafter card holders will be permitted to borrow four books , not more than two of which may be fiction , at any time on one card ... That this is a move in the right direction seems almost certain , for it makes for better service and in addition reduces clerical work . ''

		Whether emulation in respect to circulation operates with library officials in allowing this greater freedom , one can not say ; but it would be no crime if it were an impelling motive .

		POETRY AND PROSPERITY might be thought to be congenial companions ; they go well to - gether on the tongue ; but the indisputable fact remains that soul-stirring song has seldom been the product of luxurious living , and the great poets of the world have not often had their residence in Easy Street .

		`` Poets by their sufferings grow , '' says the author of `` Hudibras , '' and
Shelley	PERSON	asserts that `` most wretched men are cradled into poetry by wrong : they learn in suffering what they teach in song . ''

		Keats ,
Burns	PERSON	,
Heine	LOCATION	,
Leopardi	LOCATION	, and indeed one might add
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	PERSON	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, saw far more of the seamy than of the smooth side of life .

		One may question whether an unoppressed
Poland	LOCATION	would ever have given us a Chopin in music or a Sienkie -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 329 wicz in romance , and whether an independent
Hungary	LOCATION	could have produced the lyrics of
Petofi	ORGANIZATION	.

		What poet or composer or other crea - tive genius of the first rank has been given to the world by the imperial
Germany	LOCATION	that was started on its prosperous course by
Bismarck	PERSON	and
Moltke	PERSON	?

		Mr.
Walter Damrosch	PERSON	uttered a significant word the other day when he said : `` I can not see that
Germany	LOCATION	has produced any great master since the Franco-Prussian War .

		It is an interesting fact that the pros - perity which followed in
Germany	LOCATION	has not bred great genius .

		You might mention
Brahms	PERSON	, but he came to his maturity before the war .

		Musicians are better paid in Ger - many than ever before , but they are not pro- ducing the music they once did .

		That brings up the old question of the effect of prosperity on art .

		I do n't pretend to answer it , but I do say that it is largely to the French school that I am looking for interesting new music to-day . ' '

		As with the children of
Israel	LOCATION	when brought into a land flowing with milk and honey , so with mankind in the present day , the tendency after one has waxed fat is to turn unto false gods .

		IMPRESSIONS OF THE
LEIPZIG	LOCATION	EXPOSITION , as set forth in attractive style by Mr.
Theodore W. Koch	PERSON	,
A. L. A.	PERSON	representative , make some - what melancholy reading now in view of the abrupt closing , for obvious reasons , of several important sections of that splendid interna - tional exhibition of the book-making arts .

		Mr.
Koch	PERSON	saw the `` Ausstellung '' or the `` Bugra , '' a colloquial abbreviation for `` Buch '' and `` Graphik , '' the two subjects of first importance in the exposition in its ear - lier days , its period of undimmed promise and hopefulness ; and his official report on its main features and on the
A. L. A. Exhibit	ORGANIZATION	which he installed in its assigned quarters , was published in the ' ' Library Journal , ' ' from which it is now reprinted in separate , illus - trated form .

		The interesting and instructive peculiarities of the Russian , Japanese , En - glish , and French contributions to the en - terprise each nation occupying its own characteristic building or pavilion were des - tined soon to be excluded from view , and the most that many of us will ever know about them is what may be gathered from such re - ports as Mr.
Koch	PERSON	's .

		In bright contrast with the clouded closing of this memorable exposi - tion is his account of the `` Salamander '' with which the students opened their part of the show .

		The King of
Saxony	LOCATION	presided , there were large delegations from student societies or clubs all over
Germany	LOCATION	, gay with the corps colors , arid `` Gaudeamus Igitur '' was sung in true German style , making up in zest what was lacking in unison .

		Intelligent interest in the American library display is reported by Mr.
Koch	PERSON	.

		AN ELOQUENT PROTEST against the unim - aginable horrors , the incredible anachronism , the shameful reproach , of the present war in
Europe	LOCATION	was uttered in verse worthy of the theme by Mrs.
Caroline Fletcher Dole	PERSON	, mother of the Rev. Dr.
Charles Fletcher Dole	PERSON	and Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	, a few weeks before her death .

		Both for its own sake and because it was written by one who retained her remark - able powers up to the verge of a century , we quote the poem 's opening stanzas . ''

		War !

		In this year of our Lord !

		Too late for the barbarous sword , And deadly missiles of dread , That lay thousands with the dead ; While widows ' and orphans ' cries
Ascend	ORGANIZATION	to the pitying skies . ''

		War !

		Fitting for fiends alone Where mercy is never shown !

		Was man for such fellowship born , And human life shall he scorn , While widows ' and orphans ' tears Flow on through the desolate years ? ''

		countries ravaged with war , What is this misery for ?

		Such misery , dire and dread , All fair prosperity fled !

		While sorrow , and want , and need , For deepest compassion plead . ''

		One more of these peculiarly moving stanzas , so haunting and dirge-like in their melody , pleads for a place here . ''

		See battlefields filled with slain , And hospitals full of pain !

		Lands left to thistle and thorn , And homes deserted , forlorn While terror , grief , and despair , Fill the sweet ambient air . ''

		We have quoted but half of the entire poem , all of which is well worthy of reproduction .

		DISGUISED FRIENDS OF LITERATURE AND ART are now energetically engaged , if one may believe the `` Frankfurter Zeitung , '' in pre - paring the way -LRB- with the help of a score or two of army corps -RRB- for a better and greater literature and art than any that the world has yet beheld .

		After deploring the destruction of
Rheims	LOCATION	cathedral and other venerated monuments of architecture , and after pointing out the criminal folly of resistance to German arms on the part of cities containing such monuments , the above-named journal finds balm for its bleeding sensibilities in the 330 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	thought that one of the blessed results of the present smashing operations of the German war machine will take the form of '' works for the joy and fame of the human race more splendid than the towering churches of the Middle Ages , which have been brought by the heirs of those who built them into needless peril . ' '

		By the same process of reasoning , the
Louvain	LOCATION	library destroyed despite the
Frankfurt	LOCATION	assertion that ' ' by the rules of war of all civilized nations an unfortified city is safer than a fortress ' ' will be replaced by a better in the happy post-bellum days that are now nearing their dawn .

		Elzevirs and
Aldines	PERSON	and Caxtons , illuminated missals and early manuscript copies of the classics , are to be accounted well lost in return for the more excellent products of pens only waiting for the battle-smoke to clear away before begin - ning those `` works for the joy and fame of the human race '' which could not have been brought to birth by any gentler accoucheur than the
Krupp	ORGANIZATION	gun and the incendiary bomb .

		EUROPEAN APPRECIATION OF AMERICAN LIT - ERARY TASTE can no longer intoxicate us or turn our heads , though it has not ceased to be gratifying .

		In a recent utterance ascribed to one of
England	LOCATION	's foremost living poets occur the words , ``
America	LOCATION	has become far more than
England	LOCATION	both the market and the assize of Anglo-Saxon verse '' ; and further , `` The writer of modern verse must for the future look to
America	LOCATION	both for audience and for criticism . ''

		So says Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, if he is correctly reported .

		In these days , when the
United States	LOCATION	is recognized as holding an enviable position among the great powers as counsellor and mediator , arbiter in heated dis - putes and friend in cases of distress ; when , too , we are sending exchange professors to the great universities of the Old World , exporting our literary wares as well as our factory prod - ucts , and taking pride in foreign recognition of our painters and sculptors , it is difficult to realize that
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	once had the appro - bation of his fellow-countrymen when he de - livered himself of that oft-quoted taunt : `` In the four quarters of the globe , who reads an American book , or goes to an American play , or looks at an American picture or statue ? ''

		A CHECK TO LIBRARY ACTIVITY , as to COUnt - less other kinds of activity , including even the official forecast of our weather , is to be charged to the account of the present war in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The monthly `` Book Bulletin '' of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	prints the follow - ing , which will strike a responsive chord in many other libraries of our land : `` During the
summer	DATE	large collections of the newest books in German , French , Russian , and Polish have been received , and these are being pre - pared for circulation as rapidly as possible .

		Order lists were also in preparation for sim - ilar purchases of Bohemian and Yiddish books , but the receipt of these will be seriously delayed , if not indefinitely postponed by the unsettled conditions in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		All importa - tions of books have practically stopped , for the present , and only a few of the European newspapers and periodicals are being re - ceived , and these only irregularly and after much delay .

		Among other things , this state of affairs will cause the postponement of the issue of a revised finding list of German books , which was in progress , but which can - not be finished until numerous additional vol - umes can be secured to fill gaps , to replace worn-out and obsolete works , and to bring the collection completely up to date .

		It will be necessary , also and mainly for the above - mentioned reason to defer the opening of the Music Room for at least one month from
September	DATE	first , the date originally fixed . ''

		Quicquid delirant reges , plectuntur Achivi .

		IN DEFENCE OF
NIETZSCHE	LOCATION	, to whom the ac - cusing finger is now so often pointed , an exculpatory word comes from the newly ar - rived Sorbonne exchange professor at Har - vard .

		M.
Henri Lichtenberger	PERSON	-LRB- the
Franco	LOCATION	- German combination of names is significant -RRB- teaches German literature at the French school where he holds a chair , and is said to have carried the study of Nietzsche further than any other French scholar .

		Sententiously characterizing himself as ' ' extremement 1 ` ami de 1 ` esprit allemand , extremement 1 ` ennemi de 1 'em pire allemand , '' he asserts that `` it is false to lay the blame on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	for the philosophy which has actuated the German military leaders in this war .

		In fact , it is a gross misinterpretation of his philosophy .

		He did indeed love power , but never the power of arms , the might of mere territorial dominion .

		He loved the power of the mind and of the soul .

		Nothing , I think , could have displeased him more than the late supremacy of the materialistic military party in Ger - many . ''

		Thus has it ever been , he believes , with all the great Germans of genius .

		So was it with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The empire , das
Reich	PERSON	, has ever been a concept superimposed upon the fundamentals of German genius . ''

		This stout apologist of intellectual
Germany	LOCATION	will the more readily command our attention by reason of his having two sons now about to enter active service against materialistic and military
Germany	LOCATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 331 BEST-SELLERS OF THE MOMENT indicate , in - evitably , what is preoccupying all minds .


London	LOCATION	booksellers and to a great extent their American fellow-tradesmen are reaping golden harvests from the large sales of such timely publications as Dr.
Rappoport	PERSON	's `` Brave
Belgium	LOCATION	, '' the sevenpenny selection of Emperor
William	PERSON	's speeches , letters , and telegrams grouped under the title , `` The War Lord , '' the two-shilling English version of the renowned
Bernhardi	PERSON	's ``
Germany	LOCATION	and the Next War , '' the equally inexpensive edition of Prince von Billow 's `` Imperial Germany , '' Mr.
Wile	PERSON	's `` Men Around the
Kaiser	PERSON	, '' a new and supplemented edition of the late
Emil Reich	PERSON	's ``
Germany	LOCATION	's Swelled Head , '' and Sir
Robert Baden-Powell	PERSON	's `` Quick Training for War . ' '

		There has even sprung up an ephem - eral crop of war periodicals , to which popular attention willingly turns , and war counters or tables loaded with martial literature in great variety are common in the bookshops .

		Widely indeed have we departed from the counsel of him who bade us ' ' read Homer once , and you can read no more ; for all books else appear so mean , so poor , verse will seem prose ; but still persist to read , and
Homer	ORGANIZATION	will be all the books you need . ' '

		THE LIBRARY 'S INTEREST IN THE COMING ^ GENERATION is a well-reasoned and legitimate interest ; or , at least , so one may venture to believe , though not all libraries give such con - clusive evidence of this praiseworthy solici - tude as does the
Grand Rapids Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, where , as its monthly `` Bulletin '' announces , a selected list of books on `` Better Babies '' is mailed to every young mother as soon as she has become a mother , and thus the circulation of works on the rearing of infants is greatly stimulated .

		Some of these books , we are told , are `` almost as popular as the latest novel , '' and many copies have to be bought in order to supply the demand .

		Furthermore , `` the Superintendent of Circulation has collected a series of photographs of babies whose mothers brought them up on library books . ''

		These are on exhibition , and it is affirmed that `` a mere glance at these photographs will convince anyone that the mothers who use library books on this subject know how to raise better babies . ''

		The list itself is printed in the Sep - tember `` Bulletin . ''

		A MISINTERPRETED POET has good reason to desire a correction of the misinterpretation , and if he himself be no longer living his friends will espouse his cause and demand that justice be done him .

		Certain compatriots of the German poet
Hofmann	PERSON	von Fallersleben have felt some indignation at the false mean - ing so often attached to the refrain of his famous patriotic song written in
1841	DATE	, long before any dream of world-conquest had dis - turbed the peaceful slumbers of his fellow - Teutons .

		Of course there was then not what could be called a united
Germany	LOCATION	, but Fal - lersleben conceived the notion of such a union some years before the upheavals of
1848	DATE	had made its advisability apparent to thousands of others ; and so it came about that he wrote his `` Deutschland , Deutschland ueber Alles , '' in which the context shows clearly enough that he was not clamoring for a
Germany	LOCATION	supreme over all the world , but looking hopefully for - ward to a
Germany	LOCATION	extending over all the territory `` from the
Maas	PERSON	to the
Memel	PERSON	, from the
Etsch	PERSON	to the Belt . ''

		Therefore , whether or not his verses have since been used to kindle zeal in a less worthy cause than that advocated by him , let us at least clear the poet of all blame in the matter .

		THE LITERARY NEEDS OF A BUSINESS MAN are outlined in no illiberal spirit by the catholic - minded editor of `` The Newarker , '' who sets forth in large print on his first page the obli - gation resting on the man of commercial pur - suits to expand his mind by reading `` several newspapers '' for `` thus he studies history while it is being made , '' and `` thus he learns how business is going , '' and , lastly , `` thus he learns his own town '' two weekly periodi - cals that are named , `` the best novels as they appear , '' `` a good small book on something he is interested in , by a Man who Knows , '' the best journals of his own calling , and `` every - thing else . ''

		It is plain that Mr.
Dana	PERSON	would apply to business men the dictum of Pleydell in `` Guy Mannering '' on the subject of lawyers : `` A lawyer without history or literature is a mechanic , a mere working mason ; if he possesses some knowledge of these , he may venture to call himself an archi - tect . ''

		AN ALLEVIATION TO THE RIGORS OF CENSOR - SHIP which now so pitilessly deprive us of full and authoritative and prompt news from the battle front may be found in the announce - ment , by wireless from
Berlin	LOCATION	, that the
Kaiser	PERSON	has commissioned
Herr Rocholl	PERSON	, the German painter of battle scenes , to proceed to the firing line in western
Europe	LOCATION	and take meas - ures to preserve by his art , for all time , a graphic delineation of the struggles and tri - umphs of the military forces of the Father - land in their earnest endeavors to disseminate Teutonic culture throughout
Europe	LOCATION	.

Nov. 1 Itooks	DATE	.

		ESSAYS ox THE NOVEL .

		* To his already considerable and distin - guished body of criticism , Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	now adds another volume of essays written and published at various intervals during the
last two decades	DATE	.

		As the novel is the almost exclusive subject held up for consideration , this volume constitutes a more weighty state - ment than Mr.
James	PERSON	has heretofore given us of his conception of his art .

		The interest attaching to these `` notes '' is , indeed , very largely due to the point of view of the author , though , needless to say , the subjects are sketched with fine insight , with generous though discriminating appreciation , with the charm and felicity to which readers of Mr.
James	PERSON	have so long been accustomed .

		It seems inevitable that , incidental to his career as a novelist , Mr.
James	PERSON	should have produced a considerable body of criticism : the art of the novel is with him so much an intellectual matter , so much a manifestation of the critical spirit .

		We have the habit of calling his novels , rather crudely , `` psycho - logical ' ' ; one meaning appropriately attached to this word in this connection is that of the state of a creating mind intensely aware of itself , shedding over its every operation a white light of self - consciousness ; his novels , as we know , are thoroughly `` studied . ''

		And nothing could find criticism more congenial than this combination of intellectual curiosity with reflection .

		Criticism , moreover , to minds of his type , is not a diversion , but an inevita - ble mental process , a necessary part of appre - ciation : '' The effect , if not the prime office , of criticism is to make our absorption and our enjoyment of the things that feed the mind as aware of itself as possible , since that awareness quickens the mental demand , which thus in turn wanders further and further for pasture .

		This action on the part of the mind practically amounts to a reaching out for the reasons of its interest , as only by its so ascer - taining them can the interest grow more various .

		This is the very education of our imaginative life ; and thanks to it the general question of how to refine , and of why certain things refine more and most , on that happy consciousness , becomes for us of the last importance . ''

		For such criticism , the more reflective nov - elist provides better material , a more definite `` case , '' than he who works mainly through feeling and instinct .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	, in reading the letters of
Stevenson	PERSON	, notes in them `` no instance of his expressing a subject , as one * NOTES ON NOVELISTS , with Some Other Notes .

		By
Henry James	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		may say , as a subject hinting at what nov - elists mainly know , one would imagine , as the determinant thing in it , the idea out of which it springs . ''

		His appreciation , however , is versatile enough to enjoy
Stevenson	PERSON	, or even Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	versatile enough even to be overcome by the talent of the author of `` La dame aux Camelias '' : '' I recollect coming out of the Gymnase one night when
Madame Pierson	PERSON	had been the Mar - guerite this was very long since and giving myself up on the boulevard to a fine critical sense of what in such a composition was flimsy and what was false .

		Somehow , none the less , my fine critical sense never prevented my embracing the next opportunity to expose it to the same irrita - tion ; for I have been , I am happy to think to-day , a plaj ` goer who , whatever else he may have had on his conscience , has never had the neglect of any chance to see this dramatist acted . ''

		But this case is among the rare exceptions .

		The essays devoted to
Zola	ORGANIZATION	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	,
Balzac	LOCATION	, and
George Sand	PERSON	, occasioned by various new publications throwing new light on their lives and works , are fascinating examples of the critical and the appreciative working in full and conscious harmony .

		These novelists , however , are not new mate - rial in the hands of Mr.
James	PERSON	.

		His previous `` renderings '' of them to a degree take the edge off our curiosity regarding these later essays .

		But his chapter on ' ' The New Novel ' ' has the interest of a new subject , inasmuch as Mr.
James	PERSON	has seldom gone out of his way to disagree with his English and American con - temporaries .

		This essay begins with a discus - sion of ' ' our contemporary flood ' ' and the ab - sence in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	of sufficient critical activity to check it or improve its quality .

		At the forefront among the practi - tioners of the `` new novel '' he places Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, who are thus grouped together `` for the simple reason that with the sharpest differences of character and range they yet come together under our so con - venient measure of value by saturation . ''

		Saturation , as readers of Mr.
James	PERSON	will re - member , is the first part of his artistic creed : the novelist must observe , notebook in hand , the life he wishes to paint ; he must observe so thoroughly that he first knows as life every - thing he puts into his novel ; `` to be saturated is to be documented . ''

		This state of satura - tion is the highest value he finds in these two novelists .

		What they lack is `` the centre of interest , '' `` the sense of the whole , '' the opera - tion of any selective or arranging principle .

		A `` slice of life '' is not an adequate formula for a work of art ; Mr.
James	PERSON	opposes to it the conception of the ' ' extract , ' ' a chemical proc - ess , not a mechanical .

		His concern over these
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 333 novelists is thus confined to their treatment of their subjects .

		Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	, too , has clearly a saturation , but she is also , with Mr.
Gals	PERSON	- worthy and Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	, a votary of selec - tion and intention , an embodiment `` of some state over and above that simple state of possession of much evidence , that confused conception of what the ` slice of life ' must con - sist of '' characteristic of the work of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	.

		It will of course be noticed that these are not questions of aim but of method .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	does not concern himself with the choice of subject made by an author : '' His subject is what is given him given him by influences , by a process , with which we have nothing to do ; since what art , what revelation , can ever really make such a mystery , such a passage in the private life of the intellect , adequately trace - able for us ?

		His treatment of it , on the other hand , is what he actively gives ; and it is with what he gives that we are critically concerned . ''

		Mr.
James	PERSON	protests against the restriction placed upon the English and American nov - elist by the presence of the `` young person '' in his audience .

		The unfettered novelist can ask only one question of his material : Is it , or is it not , of the stuff of life ?

		Whenever Mr.
James	PERSON	deals with what would seem to be the question of the moral responsibility of the dispenser of fiction , as in his essays on the Italians ,
D'Annunzio	PERSON	and
Matilde Serao	PERSON	, this question merely resolves itself into questions of truth and of taste , which to him are ques - tions of artistic method .

		He handles ethical problems with gloves , does not come into di - rect contact with them , avoids the danger of a disconcerting charge .

		Thus the eroticism of
D'Annunzio	PERSON	is vulgar , that of
Matilde Serao	PERSON	is serious where it should have been comic ; given the proper tone , style , treatment , the odious effect would disappear .

		This point of view leads him to a more debatable conclu - sion in his essays on George Sand .

		As a nov - elist she is too sentimental and spontaneous to receive high rank from Mr.
James	PERSON	; but he finds in her ' ' a supreme case of the successful practice of life . ''

		This woman who so easily turned her own experiences with her lovers into `` copy , '' who so easily recovered herself in the presence of every disagreeable sit - uation , even when she herself was mainly responsible for it , who made all her heart - breaking experiences contribute to her own development , this woman is a fine example of the efficacy of tone and style to save .

		She is a `` sister to Goethe . ''

		The `` last word '' about her is `` that there is nothing for grand final Tightness like a sufficiently general humanity when a particularly beautiful voice hap - pens to serve it , '' It is of course provincial to disagree with this conclusion , and yet one feels that it is not the last word .

		George Sand perhaps kept her personality a delight - ful spectacle , but she must have been partly blind to her own essential nature .

		Was she ever a reflective moralist ?

		Was she a spec - tacle , only , even to herself ?

		Such questions , we know , go beyond Mr.
James	PERSON	's conception of criticism .

		As one reads this pleasant volume one feels that , though full of thought , it is not from the study ; that , though charming in manner , it is not of the salon .

		It comes from the artist 's studio , full of shop talk about methods and processes .

		Even his appreciation is that of a fellow - worker , always conscious of the problems of composition .

		But even though it is so thor - oughly `` professional , '' the quality of mind of the critic , as of the novelist , measures the value and interest of the completed product .

		And whatever Mr.
James	PERSON	writes is certain to show fine perception , exact and delicate ren - dering , and a most earnest curiosity regarding his art -

		* Mr.
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	achieved celebrity in his adopted land of
Germany	LOCATION	some fifteen years ago by his book entitled `` The Foundations of the Nineteenth Cen - tury , ' ' which has more recently become known to American readers .

		This present work on
Kant	PERSON	was first undertaken by him in the form of lectures to an intimate circle of acquaint - ances and , at the urgent request of these , was published some years later -LRB-
1905	DATE	-RRB- .

		The au - thorized translation by
Lord Redesdale	ORGANIZATION	, which has just appeared , has been revised by Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	himself .

		We have the authority of Lord Redesdale for the statement that the author regards this as the most important of his works .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, though by training a natural scientist , has from the outset been interested in the problem of cognition and has endeav - ored to work his way toward a complete Weltanschauung .

		Science , he realizes , has developed in violent opposition to philosophy , which has for the most part been inadequately based on experience .

		Where the scientists have taken the matter in hand themselves , they have yielded us but the poor stammer - ings of an

		334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	guide .

		His object in this book is not to give us an exhaustive treatise on
Kant	PERSON	's philoso - phy , indeed , not so much to explain the thoughts of the thinker as the way he arrived at those thoughts .

		Other books on Kant have been technical and have attacked the subject from an abstract point of view .

		Mr.
Cham	PERSON	- berlain speaks as a layman to laymen .

		In a word , he would humanize
Kant	PERSON	.

		Believing that we gain our clearest illumination from points of difference , he chooses the compara - tive method of approaching the problem .

		In successive chapters he discusses the methods used by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	,
Descartes	LOCATION	,
Giordano Bruno	PERSON	, and Plato in arriving at their philosophies of life .

		This sovereign dis - regard of chronology is amply justified in the elaboration of the author 's scheme .

		Each of the chapters contains an excursus on some particular point at issue , such as the doctrine of metamorphosis in connection with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, or the essence of life in the chapter on Plato .

		The final and longest chapter is then devoted to
Kant	PERSON	's attitude toward the fundamental questions of science and religion .

		By all odds the most illuminating of the comparisons are those with
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	.

		The relation of
Goethe to Kant	ORGANIZATION	has , so Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	thinks , been deliberately ignored by the for - mer 's biographers , who have been in part re - sponsible for the perpetuation of the legend of the `` unphilosophical '' Goethe .

		It is true that in Kant thinking predominated abnor - mally over seeing , whereas the eye was the centre of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's intellectual life .

		The lat - ter 's thinking aimed to be concrete and to be drawn exclusively from visibility .

		Where he did not follow this method rigorously , he failed , as in the `` Metamorphosis of Plants '' that uncritical jumble of idea and experience which brought down upon his head the just reproof of
Schiller	PERSON	.

		On the other hand , his '' Doctrine of Color '' is pure perception and is based wholly on empirical observations ; for Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	is willing to assert in the teeth of the physicists the validity of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's main thesis in that work , which , he complains , no man can now be induced to read .

		Kant , on the whole , was far more jealous of the rights of experience as against idea than
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		He never tired of repeating that outside expe - rience no evidence of the truth was to be found .

		He was indeed , our author thinks , the only strict philosopher of experience known to the history of human thought .

		Plato alone is worthy of being mentioned beside him .

		The surprising juxtaposition of these two names is justified by Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	on many scores .

		Like
Kant	PERSON	,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's prime care was for moral well-being .

		Neither philosopher delved into first causes nor sought for a final princi - ple .

		Both insisted upon the imperative neces - sity of seeing everything with the eye and of posing the question of cognition critically .

		What Plato knew ,
Kant	PERSON	proved .

		But
Plato	PERSON	expressed his intuitions poetically and by means of parables , while
Kant	PERSON	struggled clum - sily with the abstract jargon which he had been obliged to adopt from the language of the schools .

		Hence the apparent chasm of divergence between the two thinkers .

		Yet even
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's much misunderstood doctrine of ideas is a figurative adumbration of
Kant	PERSON	's proof of the necessary conditions of expe - rience .

		When
Plato	ORGANIZATION	says that a dog is not a dog until the idea `` dog '' has stamped it as such , he is only stating concretely
Kant	PERSON	's proposition that perceptions without concep - tions are blind .

		It is
Kant	PERSON	's unrivalled achievement that he demonstrated from the nature of our minds the essential categories of all experience .

		This scientific analysis rather than the positing of a Ding-an-sich -LRB- or the official vindication of God , freedom , and immortality -RRB- has given him , in the opinion of our author , his unique position in the history of thought .

		Kant looked upon God , not as a beginning but as an end , not as primary cause but as aim .

		The existence of free-will follows as a natural inference from the established fact of our moral nature .

		No attempt has been made by Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	to meet the modern argument that the evolution of morals has upset
Kant	PERSON	's doctrine of a categorical imperative .

		The reader is never left in doubt for a moment as to Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's own attitude toward these and sundry other problems .

		Dualism is , in his opinion , no theory but a fact ; all monism is simply false .

		Attempts to seek unity behind duality are therefore ut - terly vain .

		Our perverse inclinations toward monistic systems he ascribes to the cabalistic puerility of attaching special significance to the number One , as if it were not of the essence of unity to presuppose plurality component parts .

		The author 's disparage - ment of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, whom he regards as the enemy of all living perception , is thus readily understood .

		Readers who are familiar with `` The Foundations of the Nineteenth Cen - tury '' will recognize other favorite opinions of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, notably his disbelief in the hypothesis of biological evolution , which seems to him to be `` an idea , not an expe - rience . ''

		He attacks trenchantly the current notions of progress with which childish minds have intoxicated themselves .

		Every so-called progress of civilization , he asserts , puts new weapons into the hands of those who would
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 335 suppress the dignity of man .

		Almost every - thing in modern life tends to make us less able to see and to think .

		Civilization is daily threatening to fall back into barbarism , an ominous utterance in view of the events in
Europe	LOCATION	during the last three months .

		The author 's point of view , it will be observed , is intellectual , aristocratic , and astringent .

		He is an individualist whose lack of democratic sympathies may be measured by his assertion that the whole philosophy of socialism can be compressed into the words : ' ' ote-toi de la que je m ' y mette . ''

		As against all such external nostrums ,
Kant	PERSON	reinforces
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's teaching of the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	within us by show - ing that man can not be made happy without first being made moral and wise .

		The author is an independent , original thinker , and a persuasive writer .

		He has ac - complished the improbable by furnishing a popular , human approach to
Kant	PERSON	in two stout , closely packed volumes .

		One can not , for example , resist the eloquence of the con - cluding pages , where the Kantian standpoint is urged as the indispensable basis for all future culture .

		But besides driving home his main arguments , Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	gives the reader abundant intellectual stimulus of the incidental sort .

		The occasional audacity of his opinions is matched by the plausibility of his presentation .

		His obiter dicta must in - deed be received with much reserve .

		It should not be forgotten that the central thesis of `` The Foundations of the Nineteenth Cen - tury '' has been strongly controverted by the ethnological experts , though the manifold sug - gestiveness of that work can hardly be gain - said .

		In such matters we laymen must simply take the word of the specialist and accept , at least tentatively , the orthodox view , no matter how brilliantly the heresy may be urged .

		Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	is an accomplished Ger - man stylist .

		The translation is on the whole extraordinarily well done , though of necessity much of the savor of the original has been lost .

		However picturesque such a phrase as `` carrying owls to
Athens	LOCATION	'' may be , it inevita - bly suggests the foreign idiom , while a sen - tence like `` Out of the chaos of chemistry
Ostwald	PERSON	has known how to construct a per - spicuous erection '' is downright barbarous .

		But such lapses are rare .

		Greater care should have been exercised in the proof-reading of the French and German titles , where many mistakes have crept in .

		* Reading Dr.
Mangold	PERSON	's admirable textbook on ' Problems of Child Welfare , '' we keenly regret one thing , and that is the date of the work .

		What a pity it is that this text was not in existence , and courses based on it being given , years ago !

		The treatment of the various topics is not particularly original , it is even in places a little patchy and inconsistent , owing to the incorporation of data from mis - cellaneous sources ; but the book covers a great field , and , in spite of being condensed , is readable and interesting .

		In his Preface , Dr
Mangold	PERSON	notes that `` The book is designed especially for use by college and university students in courses on constructive and pre - ventive philanthropy .

		However , the general reader has not been forgotten , and it is hoped that the book will appeal to that growing class of men and women who in a systematic way are endeavoring to acquaint themselves with the various aspects of practical sociology . ''

		To this modest estimate of the book 's sphere of influence we would make some additions .

		What mother or father , for example , would not profit by the perusal of an up-to-date sum - mary of the sociology of childhood ?

		There are many sources of information , of course , but practically these are mainly closed to busy and often isolated people , to whom a condensed abstract is a necessity .

		What bet - ter text could be found for the year 's work of a woman 's club ?

		What about the numerous city officials , whose training has usually been entirely too narrow to enable them to deal intelligently with the problems before them ?

		And finally , why should not the college course on child-welfare become one of the great standard courses , instead of a side issue for those supposed to be philanthropically in - clined ?

		There is no doubt that practical sociology , the science and art of living together , is rap - idly gaining favor , but it must not be left to haphazard progress .

		It is altogether too easy for the energy of great movements to flow into blind alleys , or to beat vainly against insuper - able obstacles .

		Dr.
Mangold	PERSON	's work may well serve to point out the numerous and important avenues for advance and the difficulties in the way .

		It will especially tend to give the reader a broad outlook , so that he will not see in some single reform the sole promise of good .

Nov. 1	DATE	need pressure from outside to stimulate their progressive activities .

		It would be a practical and beneficent plan to raise funds to endow chairs for the exposition of child-welfare problems ; but should this be done , it would be necessary to see that the appointees were peo - ple who believed in doing things , not merely talking about them , and that the college or - ganizations did not make it difficult for stu - dents to take the courses .

		It is not practicable to review the details of Dr.
Mangold	PERSON	's book , but we must call atten - tion to the legitimate satisfaction and hope to be derived from the evidences of social gains .

		Perhaps the most striking case is that of the reduction of infant mortality in recent years . ' '

		The states for which continuous records for 12 years are available indicate a decline in the infant death rate of nearly one-fourth , while the mortality under five has decreased even more rapidly . ''

		Some have feared that the saving of infants would merely preserve weak - lings , who would succumb a little later ; but the statistics show a steady gain even in later years , thus a decline of 26 per cent from 10 to 14 years .

		Those who have worked as reform - ers during the last two or three decades have often felt discouraged , while the mass of the population , not seeing anything extraordinary happen , have been inclined to ignore or de - spise the efforts of enthusiasts .

		We now have data to show how great the success has really been , and to point the moral that social re - form in its most beneficent phases does not necessarily appear dramatic or attract the at - tention of the careless .

		The volume on '' Juvenile Courts and Proba - tion ' ' is really the report of a special committee appointed by the
National Probation Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion ; and while the text has been prepared by two members of that committee , it expresses the views of the others , the whole being highly representative of the juvenile court move - ment .

		The report takes up the laws governing the courts , the organization and procedure of the courts , the probation problem , and gives various outlines for reports and statistics , as well as forms of all kinds .

		It is thus a suffi - ciently complete guide for those initiating this type of work in new localities , and for the general public it will serve as an exposition of methods and aims .

		It is extremely interesting to follow the evolution of the work .


Origi	PERSON	- nally , the courts considered only the crime itself , for which , upon conviction , a certain punishment was legal .

		The juvenile courts considered not only the crime , but the boy or girl , the problem being to reform and renovate the individual .

		It has become apparent , how - ever , that the child can not be intelligently studied or helped without reference to his environment , and the family engages the at - tention of the court .

		The family is part of the social group , so the circle continually widens , until every reader of these lines finds himself in some measure called to account .

		As a philosophical or academic proposition , all this has been clear from the start , but the interesting thing is that the realization of it is more and more guiding the activities of those who have to deal with juvenile delinquency .

		There has been and is much objection in va - rious quarters to this wholesale answer to the question of
Cain	PERSON	, and every advantage has been taken of such imperfections as existed in the armor of the reformers ; but after all , aside from questions of personalities or particular methods , the new outlook is absolutely wise and necessary .

		The great growth of the probation system has resulted from the enlarged point of view .

		At first , it was merely a question of obliging the delinquents to live up to the rulings of the court .

		By degrees the probation officers ceased to be merely policemen , and became virtually guardians of the young people .

		So we are given this definition : ' ' Probation is an intimate , personal relation which deals with all the factors of a child 's life , particularly his home .

		Its chief function is to adjust the forces of the community to the child 's life .

		Every social agency is called into play , the object being to surround the child with a net - work of favorable influences which will enable him to maintain normal habits of life . ' '

		Con - sequently , the probation officer should be temperamentally suited to the work and ade - quately trained .

		The tendency is to keep more and more cases out of court altogether , dealing with them in the homes .

		At first sight , it seems almost grotesque that a few pro- bation officers should attempt to influence the ways of a great city ; but there are other agencies with which they may cooperate , while the intelligent treatment of a few cases may indirectly affect a multitude .

		The report in - sists upon the value of statistics , but justly remarks that `` it requires a long and careful study of any extensive group of statistics to interpret correctly their significance to the community ... Too often we find statistics complete in themselves , but almost valueless because they are not properly interpreted . ''

		The present reviewer , recently investigating the statistical results accumulated by the
Juvenile Court	ORGANIZATION	at
Denver	LOCATION	, was astonished to find how misleading the most carefully gath - ered data may be , unless judged and inter - preted by those actually engaged in the work .

		Thus , the increasing skill of the probation offi - THE DIAL , 337 cers tends to diminish the number of cases treated in the court , and therefore entered in the records , without any reference to a dimin - ution in the number of offences .

		The cases involving girls are mostly dealt with by a spe - cial officer , and do not appear in the records .

		The comparatively small number of cases in which the father is living , but the mother is dead , as compared with those in which the mother is living but the father is dead , is ex - plained by the fact that in the former case the children are generally sent to the orphan asy - lum .

		The practically negligible offences of Russian children are not wholly to be ex - plained by the good behavior of that race , be - cause many Russians are classed as Hebrews , and so appear in the statistics .

		However , the large number of offences by children of Amer - ican parents remains somewhat surprising , and suggests the inquiry whether after all the tendency to make trouble under conditions which offer little legitimate outlet for surplus activities is not to some extent an indication of qualities which under other circumstances would be socially valuable .

		Thus we come to the old question of nature and nurture , which must be ever in the mind of the juvenile court .

		We venture to suggest that the court officials and especially the probation officers would do well to make some study of the re - cent results of students of heredity , which would certainly illuminate every phase of their work .

		It would probably be easy , in many cities , to arrange for courses of lectures by members of university faculties who had given special attention to these matters .

		The greatest obstacle , at present , seems to be the high pressure under which the work is done , leaving neither time nor strength for anything outside of the routine duty of the day .

		`` Children in Bondage '' is a vigorous pro- test against the wrongs inflicted on children by commercial interests , and will appeal to many who have neither the industry nor the patience to go through works of the type just reviewed .

		The authors are not afraid to hit hard in a good cause , and we know that their blows are taking effect .

		Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	's new volume of poems , '' Philip the King , '' contains , in addition to the brief drama in verse which furnishes the title , a number of poems already familiar to magazine readers .

		Among these are '' Biography , '' '' Ships , '' and the war poem entitled ``
August , 1914	DATE	. ''

		The volume is already published in

		IMMIGRANTS , PAST AND PRESENT .

		* Many Americans have had their confidence in
America	LOCATION	's powers of assimilation rudely disturbed since the outbreak of the war in
Europe	LOCATION	by the unexpected appearance among us of thousands of persons of European birth or parentage whose sympathies appear to be wholly at odds with those of our own institu - tions and enormously in favor of military despots and despotism .

		Though Professor
Ross	PERSON	's book , `` The Old World in the New , '' was written and in part serially published be - fore the war stunned us , it will be to those chapters in which he discusses the adaptabil - ity to our institutions possessed by the various nations contributing to our population in re - cent years that the puzzled American will most eagerly turn .

		It seems doubtful whether his book could have obtained as good a hearing before the fact that we have so many among us whom we have failed to assimilate nationally was brought patently home .

		His Preface sets forth that incorrigible optimism of ours which will not see a threat to
America	LOCATION	but only a promise to the Old World in those who come unless the newcomer chances to have a complection different from ours , when we sometimes see more of a threat than exists .

		This is highly altruistic , but it is not in the least hard-headed or common-sensible .

		The conclusion of the war now waging , when it does come to an end , will see myriads of folk from the devastated regions knocking at our gates , as has happened in times past .

		Whether our altruism will stand the test and our optimism come triumphantly through such an invasion is rather beside the ques - tions raised in this thorough-going volume : the point is whether we are to hand down to our own children an impaired heritage or not .

		Professor
Ross	PERSON	thinks we are doomed to , and he thought so before the contingency of war arose to add force to his warnings .

		The earlier portion of the book is devoted to a consideration of the original composition of the people of these States .

		He begins with the first settlement , that of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Here begins , too , that series of frank and out - spoken criticisms of immigrants and their an - cestors , which would effectually stifle any aspirations for an elective office the author might cherish .

		338 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	is a myth ; for it is now generally admitted that the aristocracy of eighteenth-century
Virginia	LOCATION	sprang chiefly from ' members of the country gen - try , merchants and tradesmen and their sons and relatives , and occasionally a minister , a physician , a lawyer , or a captain in the merchant service / fleeing political troubles at home or tempted by the fortunes to be made in tobacco .

		Less promising was the broad substratum that sustained the pros - perity of the colony .

		For fifty years indentured servants were coming in at the rate from a thou - sand to sixteen hundred a year ... The slums and alleys were raked for material to stock the plantations .

		Hard-hearted men sold dependent kinsfolk to serve in the colonies .

		Kidnappers smuggled over boys and girls gathered from the streets of
London	LOCATION	and
Bristol	LOCATION	... American scholars are coming to accept the British estimate that about 50,000 convicts were marketed on this side the water . ''

		After a sufficient survey of the constituents of our colonial and pre-constitutional popula - tion , the Huguenots , Germans , and Scotch -
Irish	LOCATION	, Professor Boss passes to the great waves that have incorporated themselves in our body politic during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries : the Irish , driven here by British misgovernment and famine ; the Germans flee - ing from the tyranny of Hohenzollerns and other despots , and more recently driven by economic pressure ; the Scandinavians , seek - ing betterment of home conditions ; the Ital - ians , the Slavs , the Hebrews from eastern
Europe	LOCATION	; and thereafter the lesser groups , Finns ,
Magyars	ORGANIZATION	, Portuguese , Greeks , and
Levantines	LOCATION	.

		In each case the actual contribu - tion of such groups is carefully , impartially , and fearlessly considered ; their powers of self-government and of absorption of Amer - ican ideals are weighed , and their contribu - tions for good and ill to criminality , delin - quency , pauperism , insanity , are viewed in the light of the available statistics .

		To set forth the topics discussed which should interest every lover of his country would be to rewrite the book , for there is no page of it negligible .

		A chapter is devoted to the `` Economic Consequences of Immigra - tion , '' and it is not a narrative of sunshine and hope .

		Another deals with the `` Social Effects of Immigration , '' and this ought to jar us out of national self-complacency , if we can be so jarred .

		That taking up the prob - lem of `` Immigrants in Politics '' does not touch the question of Americans as bribers and immigrants as the bribed , or that of the swamping of American radicalism by inher - ited European conservatism , but it does deal with the even more important problem pre - sented by thousands of voteless workers .

		The concluding chapter on `` American Blood and Immigrant Blood '' contains some messages of reassurance , but not enough to leave any thinking person comfortable about the future .

		It is more than a little alarming that the American people , as fecund as any on earth up to the very moment of the com - ing of the foreigner in
1830	DATE	, should utterly fail to maintain their older birth-rate in his presence .

		This statement of it , as
Francis Amasa Walker	PERSON	pointed out years ago , is to be taken with complete literalness : '' Not only did the decline in the native element , as a whole , take place in singular correspondence with the excess of foreign arrivals , but it occurred chiefly in just those regions to which those new - comers most frequently resorted . ''

		Professor
Ross	PERSON	does not elaborate ; but it has been shown time and again that if a homogeneous American community , seeking the establishment of factories for the sake of `` progress , '' takes into its midst a population of foreign operatives , the birth-rate of the community as a whole maintains itself , but only because it is kept up by the superior fecundity of the immigrant .

		It is in this last chapter that a broad dis - tinction is outlined , separating into groups , colonial and national , those who have been making the American people of the past and are going to make the Americans of the fu - ture .

		Those above the norm or average of the countries whence they came are called `` super-representative , '' those below it `` sub - representative , '' and the rest merely `` repre - sentative '' : '' Super-representative : English Pilgrims ,
Puri	PERSON	- tans ,
Quakers	ORGANIZATION	, Catholics ,
Scotch Covenanters	ORGANIZATION	, French Huguenots , German sectaries . ''

		` Representative : English of
Virginia	LOCATION	,
Mary	PERSON	- land , and the
Carolinas	LOCATION	, Scotch-Irish , Scotch High - landers , Dutch , and Swedes .

		`` Sub-representative : English of early
Georgia	LOCATION	, transported English , eighteenth-century Germans . ''

		In our national period the Germans of
1848	DATE	stand out as a super-representative flow .

		The Irish stream has been representative , as was also the early German migration .

		The German inflow since
1870	DATE	has brought us very few of the elite of their people , and I have already given reasons for believing that the Scandinavian stream is not alto - gether representative .

		Our immigration from
Great Britain	LOCATION	has distinctly fallen off in grade since the chances in
America	LOCATION	came to be less attrac - tive than those in the British empire .

		However , no less an authority than Sir
Richard Cartwright	PERSON	thinks that ` between
1866	DATE	and
1896	DATE	one-third at least of the whole male population of
Canada	LOCATION	be - tween the ages of twenty and forty found their way to the

1914	DATE	J THE DIAL 339 common .

		There is little sign of an intellectual element among the Magyars , Russians , South Slavs , Italians , Greeks , or Portuguese .

		This does not hold , however , for currents created by race discrimination or oppression .

		The Armenian , Syrian , Finnish , and Russo-Hebrew streams seem representative , and the first wave of Hebrews out of
Russia	LOCATION	in the eighties was superior .

		The Slovaks , German Poles , Lithuanians ,
Esthonians	LOCATION	, and other restive subject groups probably send us a fair sample of their quality . ''

		A little earlier the later immigration has been stated to be unfit to maintain our American standards , however it may conform to those of the country whence it flows . ' '

		The blood now being injected into the veins of our people is sub-common , '' Professor
Ross	PERSON	observes .

		`` To one accustomed to the aspect of the normal American population , the
Cali	LOCATION	- ban type shows up with a frequency that is startling . ''

		As a result he believes that our national types of beauty must suffer .

		He does not tell how much the newcomers have debased our English speech .

		The book offers no scheme of protection against the ills it proves are threatening us , and no panacea for those which heedlessness has already brought us .

		But it is a book which should be read .

		We Americans of the older stock have little first-hand knowledge of the facts it relates , and must be content to take them second-hand .

		In any event , the im - portant thing is to know them .

		We may either refuse or accept further immigration .

		But to continue stupidly to ignore the prob - lem of immigration is neither humanitarian nor patriotic .

		GRADUATES OF YALE .

		* The Reverend
Anson Phelps Stokes	PERSON	's hobby of collecting autograph letters of eminent `` Yalensians '' has had a happy issue in two impressively printed and bound quarto vol - umes containing biographical sketches of seventy-nine
Yale	ORGANIZATION	men , together with briefer notes on a number of others of subordinate importance .

		The names were selected from the latest -LRB-
1910	DATE	-RRB- edition of the quinquennial catalogue ; those now living , and those who have died since the publication of the cata - logue , have been omitted from consideration .

		The arrangement is according to the field of activity in which each man was most noted .

		Foremost is that of religion , at least if one surveys the long stretch from the foundation of
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	`` for upholding & Propagating of the
Christian Protestant Religion	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		Yale 's * MEMORIALS OF EMINENT YALE MEN .

		By

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated in photogravure .

		New Haven :

		contribution to the
New England Theology	ORGANIZATION	, the establishment of the
American Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, her part in the missionary movement which began in
1806	DATE	, and the training afforded by the
Yale Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	are represented by biographical studies of such divines as
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	,
Samuel Seabury	PERSON	,
David Brainerd	PERSON	, and
Nathaniel William Taylor	PERSON	.

		The second chapter , devoted to authors , is of course a meagre list in comparison with what
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	could present .

		Mr.
Stokes	PERSON	points out that his Alma Mater has been conspicuous for fortiter in re rather than for suaviter in modo , and proceeds candidly enough : `` As far back as
1768	DATE	, President
Stiles	PERSON	referred to English composition as a thing in which ` we Yalensians do not pretend to excel , ' and somewhat more than two generations later , the ' Lit . '

		had this criticism : ' In stout , manly intellect , in acute , analytic discrimination , in clear , sound judgment , in a pure , elevated taste , in energy and activity of mind ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has acknowledged no superior , and but one rival , in
America	LOCATION	.

		We are sorry we can not say as much for purity , beauty , and classic ele - gance of style . ''

		The chief biographies that follow are those of
John Trumbull	PERSON	,
Joel Barlow	PERSON	,
Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	,
N. P. Willis	PERSON	,
Donald G. Mitchell	PERSON	, and
Edmund Clarence Stedman	PERSON	.

		The third division is that of `` Educational Leaders . ' '

		In this field
Yale	ORGANIZATION	takes high rank .

		One hundred and fifty-seven of her graduates have been college presidents , and in educa - tional pioneering her achievement has been surpassed by only one university .

		The biog - raphies in this group include
Jonathan Dick	PERSON	- inson , first President of Princeton College ;
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	, first President of King 's -LRB- now
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- College ;
Eleazar Wheelock	PERSON	, founder and first President of Dartmouth Col - lege ; and
Daniel Coit Oilman	PERSON	, first President of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the next , and closely related , division of scholars , there are few of first-rate importance .

		The lexicog - raphers
Webster	PERSON	and
Worcester	LOCATION	are included here .

		Next are `` Men of Science ''
Silliman	PERSON	,
James Dwight Dana	PERSON	,
Samuel William John	PERSON	- son , etc. .

		Then come ' ' Inventors and Artists ' ' a somewhat odd combination despite the author 's remark that the `` faculty of the imagination is at the basis of both '' in - cluding
Eli Whitney	PERSON	and
Samuel F. B. Morse	PERSON	.

		Of statesmen ,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	has had a large repre - sentation sixty-two
United States	LOCATION	senators , twenty members of the Cabinet , twenty-eight ambassadors and ministers , forty-seven gov - ernors of states .

		Mr.
Stokes	PERSON	presents a di - verting list , beginning with Mr.
Taft	PERSON	as presi - dent and
Calhoun	PERSON	as vice-president , to prove that `` it would be possible to make up an 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	almost complete federal government from
Yale	ORGANIZATION	men who , at different times , have held the most important positions . ''

		The roll of fame is concluded by the '' Lawyers and Jurists , '' and `` Patriots and Soldiers . ''

		There are also supplementary chapters on `` Historical Factors of Influence at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- which are `` study , religion , inspiring teach - ers , and association with men '' -RRB- ; `` Common Characteristics of Most Eminent Yale Men '' -LRB- the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	ideal socially `` expresses itself in democracy , spiritually in faith , intellectually in conservatism , and morally in constructive activity '' -RRB- ; and `` Historic Universities in a Democracy '' -LRB- reprinted from `` The Yale Re - view , ' '
July , 1913	DATE	-RRB- .

		The appendices name the most distinguished
Yale	ORGANIZATION	graduates according to the states of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	in which they lived , and according to the
Yale	ORGANIZATION	classes with which they graduated .

		There is a full index .

		Although the book will be of most value to
Yale	ORGANIZATION	graduates to such , indeed , it will prove a useful and inspiring work it ought to command a more general interest as well .

		It is true that many of the `` major biog - raphies '' -LRB- such as those of
Edwards	PERSON	and
Cooper	PERSON	-RRB- seem rather purposeless , just because the men commemorated are eminent and have often been written about ; and it is also true that the minor biographies often deal with men relatively obscure , and so do not always justify themselves .

		On the other hand , one should note that in all the biographies the college life of the men has been stressed par - ticularly , and that the biographies include letters , reference to portraits , busts , and win - dows in
Yale	ORGANIZATION	buildings and to
Yale	ORGANIZATION	lecture - ships and scholarships , and a few words regarding the chief writings by and on the men whose lives are sketched .

		Moreover , it is a great advantage to have all of the lives in one well-rounded work , which may be used for reference as well as for insight into
Yale	ORGANIZATION	life in the past and the ideals of her graduates .

		It is worth mentioning here that `` one-third of the biographies given in these volumes are of men who were ordained ministers , or regu - larly licensed to preach , '' and that of the forty-three men who were eligible for member - ship in
Phi Beta Kappa	LOCATION	, thirty-four , or sev - enty-nine per cent , were actually members .

		This is the kind of publication which is not likely to be undertaken , at least on so ambi - tious a scale , save by such an .

		institution as the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the kind of pub - lication which goes far toward justifying the existence of university presses .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* An unusual personality offers tempting material to the novelist , and a tempting prob - lem , also .

		But the occasions on which a nov - elist has made really successful use of a great , or even a well-known , man as a hero are conspicuously few .

		What a multitude of bad novels have been written about a figure like
Napoleon !	PERSON


George Meredith	PERSON	took excel - lent advantage of the opportunity offered by the case of
Ferdinand Lassalle	PERSON	, but Mr.
Mau	PERSON	- rice
Hewlett	PERSON	wrote one of his least satisfac - tory novels about
Byron	PERSON	.

		It would seem to be a rule that the experiment of taking an actual personage for a hero is dangerous , other things being equal , in proportion as the personage chosen is truly impressive in his historical character .

		The less familiar the original is to readers of novels the less likely they are to object to the imitation .

		Mrs. de Selincourt furnishes in `` The Encounter '' an excellent illustration of the difficulty which attaches to presenting a much-discussed personality in a novel .

		For her hero is no less a person than
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	.

		Perhaps no man so recently living is the subject of as sharp difference of opinion among educated persons as he .

		There are those who find in
Nietzsche	LOCATION	's writings the stimulus and the consolation which their grandfathers found in the
Bible	LOCATION	; there are those who regard his books as the very centre and cause of the most dangerous tendency in modern thought and conduct , and there are those who regard the interest in him as an inexplicable mystery .

		Naturally , no repre - sentation of him in a novel will please more than one section of this triply , and rather evenly , divided public .

		Mrs. de Selincourt ` si view of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is ironic .

		The spectacle of so weak a man making such fierce and such large demands on life arouses in her the spirit of comedy which is so intimately con - nected with her skill as a novelist .

		The `` encounter '' of her title is that of
Herr Weh	ORGANIZATION	- litz -LRB-
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and an American girl ,
Persis Fennamy	ORGANIZATION	.

		At their first meeting , he has kept silent while his friend , young
Von Liidinstein	PERSON	, discusses
Anna Karenina	PERSON	with Persis .

		She speaks : '' ' It is through passion that life and its suffer - ings and its evil is perpetuated .

		It is true that
Tolstoi	PERSON	is the apostle of death .

		That is why he is so great .

		He sees the truth .

		As a thinker he has not been great enough to follow intuition to its logical consequences .

		He is a Buddhist who tries * THE ENCOUNTER .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 341 to condone life .

		As an artist he has condemned it finally . ' ''

		While
Liidinstein	PERSON	and the young girl thus de - bated their incongruous theme ,
Herr Wehlitz	PERSON	had sat listening , motionless , his eyes dilated .

		Now , suddenly , he sprang to his feet and leaned for - ward toward Persis , resting his finger-tips upon the table . '

		You do not know what you say ! '

		he exclaimed in a vibrating voice while a tremor of intense feeling almost convulsed his face . '

		You are a child and do not know what you say !

		You have read
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, nicht wdhr ?

		I ask you .

		You have read
Schopenhauer	PERSON	? '

		He rapped vio - lently with his finger-tips upon the table . ''

		Persis bowed assent .

		She maintained her calm . '' '

		I thought so .

		You have read
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and believe that he has said the last word .

		No ; listen to me ' ; he held up his hand as she sought to interpose a qualification . '

		You are in - fected .

		It is enough ; listen to me now .

		It is I who have the last word to speak , a word that upbuilds more than it destroys .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	saw that life is suffering and want and striving .

		It is true .

		I grant it .

		I flinch from nothing of his truth .

		But what I have to say is that life is not valueless on that account .

		Cowards find it so , and rot to the nothingness where they belong .

		You are not one of them .

		You can not look me in the eyes and say that you are one of them .

		No .

		Yours is not the weakness that turns shuddering away from life .

		Yours is the youth and pride and strength that measures itself against life and scorns its puerilities .

		Tolstoi would lead the world into a nest of maggots where the weak cling together and find sustainment in loathsome unity . '

		... '' The speech of
Herr Wehlitz	PERSON	is representative enough of a view which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	expressed in many ways .

		But it does seem to be taking a mean advantage to give to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	in English the awkwardness of German idiom .

		It takes from his dignity and it does not sug - gest that in the use of his own language he was an artist .

		Nevertheless ,
Herr Wehlitz	PERSON	captures the imagination of Persis , and Mrs.
de Selincourt	PERSON	's comedy is begun .

		It is only fair to add that she conducts it with all the delicately effective art , especially those parts of it which grow from the relation of Persis and her mother , of which she has become the exponent .

		The anonymous author of `` The House of Deceit '' expressly denies that his hero is a real person , saying in a foreword : `` I think it is well for me to state that the chief person of this story is neither founded upon nor aimed to represent , however indirectly , any politi - cian in real life . ''

		It is the fate of this state - ment to start the suspicion it would prevent , especially when we remember that this is an English novel and that the English law of libel is peculiarly strict and severe in such cases .

		But the suspicion attaches itself to no familiar public character , so far as we are concerned , and the portrait which it is the book 's pur - pose , to present has not the defects of a photograph .

		Indeed , it is a workmanlike por - trait , which bears every evidence of having been done by an old hand ; and though the tale has a moral to it , the meaning is inherent and not ancillary .


Maurice Sangster	PERSON	came up to
London	LOCATION	as an ambitious young man , a non - conformist , a teetotaller , and an egotist .

		One of his early adventures was with a newspaper editor who liked his articles so much that he was willing to explain how they could be made better .

		Maurice was too much pleased with the praise he received to reflect deeply on the meaning of the dispraise and , besides , he was ambitious .

		He followed the news - paper editor 's advice about insisting less on the non-conformist , teetotalling part of him - self without much trouble .

		It was the kind of thing he continued to do throughout his career , this dropping a principle whenever it proved inconvenient , until he became home secretary and realized that his life was a hol - low sham .

		Whoever the author may be , he knows the situation into which he has put
Maurice Sangster	PERSON	, and he describes it in an admirable , though not at all a precious , style .

		It is altogether improbable that any person generally known suggested ' ' The Rise of
Jen	PERSON	- nie Gushing '' to Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	, but it is almost equally improbable that she wrote without a model in mind .

		For though the superficial outlines of her story , as of any story which turns on the love of a wealthy young portrait painter and a woman whom he has known as a servant and model , are conventional , the material of it is mostly human and true .

		We have felt that Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	's previous novels occasionally betrayed that sentimental view of life which is as alien to artistic truth as it is to scientific truth .

		But in this newest book we feel only that
Jennie	PERSON	is a little too splen - did a creature , a little too richly endowed with strengths , and charms , and capacities .

		With this exception her story is genuinely to be enjoyed .

		Jennie began life in a slum , and spent some years in a reform school as a re - sult of that accident .

		But it was not wholly a misfortune , in Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	's view : '' Not for nothing had Jennie Gushing spent those first twelve or thirteen years of her life in a slum .

		The memory of them underlay all subse - quent experience indestructibly and unalterably like the foundation rock of certain geological formations ; and , however the processes of reform worked upon
Jennie	PERSON	otherwise , they could have made no impression upon that lowest stratum of 342 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	practical wisdom and first-hand observation of life . ''

		In the most direct , intelligent , and cour - ageous way ,
Jennie	PERSON	set about satisfying her own demands on herself .

		When her steady determination weakened at all , it was when love moved her more strongly than any of her calculations had allowed for .

		But when the time came , she left young
Donelson Meigs	PERSON	unhesitatingly and she refused as firmly to go back to him under any condition .

		There is something stirring in
Jennie	LOCATION	's fortitude , even when we do not wholly believe in it .

		And there is a great deal to be said for the kind of novel Mrs.
Watts	PERSON	writes , a novel replete with carefully observed facts , a record given meaning by both the historical and the socio - logical sense .

		The type as literature has some of the defects of its qualities as a document .

		But it is a sturdy , honest , and necessary type .

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		In `` The Auction Block '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , Mr.
Rex Beach	PERSON	has abandoned
Alaska	LOCATION	for Broadway .

		His heroine ,
Lorelei Knight	PERSON	, was beautiful .

		Her mother decided that the only way to capitalize her charms was to move from the small town which had been the family home to
New York	LOCATION	.

		The result justified the mother 's shreVdness , if not her concern for her daughter 's welfare .

		Lorelei imme - diately found a place in a '' revue '' and in two years she was so successful a beauty that her in - come made the family comfortable .

		Most , if not all , the types and situations expected in a story of the sort are introduced .

		Lorelei 's acquaintances include the only son of one of the chief figures in the steel syndicate , a chorus girl who is a victim of cocaine , `` gunmen , '' financiers , gamblers , and women of the demi-monde .

		In the end she man - aged to escape the life into which she thus entered and , never having been thoroughly contaminated by it , to attain happiness .

		Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	has told again the story of a small boy who redeemed a mining camp populated by unregenerate sons of men .

		The hero of '' The Little Angel of Canyon Creek '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- had , however , the assistance of two adults ; this couple came to
Canyon Creek	LOCATION	to establish a restau - rant and remained to start a Sunday-school .

		We leave the community safely singing hymns .

		The new volume of stories from the store which Miss
Edna Ferber	PERSON	possesses is entitled '' Person - ality Plus '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Technically the hero of them is a young American named Jock , but in reality
Emma McChesney	PERSON	, '' secretary to the
T. A. Buck Featherloom Petticoat Company	ORGANIZATION	, '' is again the principal figure .

		Those who receive slight intellectual thrills from Miss
Ferber	PERSON	's humorous observation of American life and those who enjoy reading it as they would enjoy talking over old times with a friend whose turn for epithet and comment pleased them , admire these stories .

		It must have delighted Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	to gather , even if it was only in imagination , such a crew as took part in '' The Mutiny of the Elsi - nore '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		More than one member re - minds the reader of the titular hero of '' The Sea Wolf . ''

		The first mate , a veritable gorilla , owns a phonograph and finds in it his one gentle amuse - ment .

		Another character , a malevolent cripple , reads Renan ,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and Zola for relaxation .

		There is a love story , but Mr.
London	LOCATION	's real object is to revel in sailing a ship round the Horn with a crew of devils ; and in that he admirably suc - ceeds .

		The story that Mr.
Earl Derr Biggers	PERSON	has told in `` Love Insurance '' -LRB- Bobbs-Merrill -RRB- is ingenious to the last degree .

		It involves a beautiful , viva - cious , and wealthy young woman , the son of the astounding Earl of Raybrook -LRB- who played polo at the age of eighty - two -RRB- , an American advertising expert , the wonderful diamond necklace known as '' Chain Lightning 's Collar , '' and an arrangement with
Lloyd	PERSON	's by which the young lord was insured to the extent of 75,000 against the possibility that the young lady would change her mind before she married him .

		Last year Miss
Margaret Peterson	PERSON	won the Mel - rose prize novel competition with '' The Lure of the Little Drum . ''

		This year she presents '' Blind Eyes '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , an even better book .

		It is the story of a young and naive girl who rebels at the prospect , suddenly revealed , of marriage and goes up to
London	LOCATION	to make a place for herself .

		There she observes the downfall of a friend and learns what love is .

		Miss
Peterson	PERSON	is still finding her way as a novelist , but she has interesting things to tell and she seems anxious to tell them as well as she can .

		Mr.
Ridgwell Cullum	PERSON	writes of the gold fields of the Yukon and the wheat fields of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The hero of '' The Way of the Strong '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- grew up in the first region and became a man of wealth and power in the second .

		His story , full of primi - tive passions , is interwoven with that of
Monica Manson	PERSON	, who was the victim of her own unselfish - ness .

		At her death ,
Monica	ORGANIZATION	's sister charged her with the care of an illegitimate son , urging her to acknowledge him as her own by an early marriage with a man since lost at sea .

		Monica 's marriage was complicated by the necessity of concealing the boy , as well as by the desire for revenge of an enemy of his father 's .

		But the end of the thrilling situation which Mr.
Cullum	PERSON	has worked up is a happy one .

		`` Sylvia '' -LRB-
Winston	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the second volume of the trilogy which Mr.
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	began with ''
Sylvia	PERSON	's Marriage . ''

		It is a tract on the order of M. Brieux 's '' Damaged Goods . ''

		Sylvia 's child is a victim of her husband 's profligacy .

		She tries for a year to live with him in spite of the facts and then returns to the southern town from which she came to inaugurate a local campaign in favor of eugenics .

		Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	has made some attempts to lighten a story as factual as a vice report but without much success .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 343 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Professor ' ' When 7 use a word , ' Humpty SfSSSf '
Dumpty	PERSON	said in rather a scorn -
Germany	LOCATION	.

		f u i tone , ` it means just what I choose it to mean neither more nor less . ' ' '

		This citation from a well-known authority might have been used as a motto on the title - page of Professor
Hugo Miinsterberg	PERSON	's `` The War and
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- to prepare the reader for revising the meaning of custom - ary words after reading the work provided he lend it credit .

		It appears to have been written by a superman for supermen , with a view to proving that
Germany	LOCATION	is under no need to observe ordinary morality .

		Its author has undertaken in the past to point out to
Germany	LOCATION	the sentiments of
America	LOCATION	, and to
America	LOCATION	the sentiments of
Germany	LOCATION	, apparently without having learned that neither nation is patient with sophistry .

		His method is simple .

		It con - sists in ignoring everything characteristic of German militarism , ignoring Von Treitschke , General
von Bernhardi	PERSON	, and the others who have stimulated the world-ambition of the Ger - man governing class , ignoring the standing toasts through many years of the German naval and army officers of `` To the Day ! ''

		and `` To the
Greater Germany	LOCATION	overseas ! ''

		or dismissing the apprehensions they have raised as `` silly . ''

		It discloses the almost incomprehensible dis - tance between the German military mind and the American intelligence , one which forces the conclusion that the German cause must be worse than any of us have supposed it to be , when such arguments can be put forth in its defence .

		Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	's qualifica - tion of the violation of Belgian neutrality leaves one gasping .

		``
Belgium	LOCATION	knew exactly that these neutrality treaties were not treaties comparable to the contracts of private per - sons who are bound by the laws of the land and by the laws of honesty to fulfil them under every possible condition .

		It is nothing but sheer hypocrisy if the enemies of Ger - many , including the Anglophile portion of the American press , behave as if this had not been common knowledge the world over . ''

		This is the major ethical premise of the argument , buttressed by the over-true interrogatory : `` Did not
America	LOCATION	break its solemn treaty with
Colombia	LOCATION	when a vital interest was involved ?

		Is not the majority of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	even inclined to apologize for the wrong which was done to
Colombia	LOCATION	in the
Panama	LOCATION	revolution ? ''

		It certainly is , wherein it differs from Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	in the case of
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		The minor premise appears to be contained in this : `` On the day the war between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	seemed un - avoidable , it was reported that fifty automo - biles full of French officers rushed over the frontier to
Liege	LOCATION	and were welcomed in the fortress , which had been partly built by French engineers ... Everything suggested that
Germany	LOCATION	's long-standing fear was justi - fied , that French-speaking
Belgium	LOCATION	was in a secret understanding with
France	LOCATION	. ''

		The amiable conclusion is : ``
Germany	LOCATION	could do what it did with a clean conscience ; it did not violate the higher laws of honor . ''

		The Chancellor of the German Empire did not know that Professor
Miinsterberg	PERSON	felt that way about it , or he might not have an - nounced to the Reichstag on
August 4	DATE	, `` Our troops have ... perhaps already penetrated into
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		This is against the law of nations ... We have been compelled to ignore the just protests of the governments of
Luxemburg	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	.

		The injustice we commit we will repair as soon as our military object has been attained . ''

		This , at least , sounds like a man talking , a man self-con - demned as unjust and a law-breaker , but still a man .

		Americans may be pardoned if they pre - fer to take
Baron von Bethmann-Hollweg	PERSON	's view of it , rather than
Humpty Dumpty 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Kit carson and Mr -
Edwin L. Sabm	PERSON	, who has the frontier long been interested in the old frontier , has added a valuable volume to its annals in `` Kit Carson Days , 1809-1868 '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , a fully documented and authenticated biography of the famous old Indian fighter and Civil War soldier , and a history of his times and compan - ions , illustrated by many rare prints .

		Carson was born in
Missouri	LOCATION	in
1809	DATE	, of
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania Scotch-Irish stock strained through
Kentucky	LOCATION	, where the family made an alliance with the kinsfolk of
Daniel Boone	PERSON	.

		Bound out to learn the saddlers ' trade , at sixteen young
Christopher	PERSON	ran away to follow the
Santa	LOCATION	Fe trail , and from that time until his death at
Fort Lyon	LOCATION	,
New Mexico	LOCATION	, in
1868	DATE	, his history is that of the
Southwest	LOCATION	; in his biog - rapher 's words : `` the story of beaver and of Indians ; of mountain , caiion , valley , desert , and stream ransacked through and through by the fur hunter ; of white blood and red blood meeting , striving , and mingling mingling sometimes in friendly union but far oftener in the struggle of mutual hate . ''

		He early gained a reputation among both white men and red for an honesty so inflexible that it was never doubted ; this led , after years of fur hunting and all the chances of a path - finder in savage country , to his appointment as Indian agent among the Utes , `` the most difficult Indians to manage within the terri - tory . ''

		But this was not until after he had 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	proved himself as fearless as he was honest and had borne no small share in the
Kearny	LOCATION	and , later , in the
Fremont	LOCATION	expeditions during the Mexican war , and had taken part in more than one battle with the redskins .

		At the outbreak of the war between the States he became colonel of the First New Mexican volunteers , which he helped to raise , and took part in the battle of
Valverde	LOCATION	, assuming com - mand at
Fort Craig	LOCATION	afterward .

		His most celebrated Indian fight was at
Adobe Walls	ORGANIZATION	in
1864	DATE	.

		He was colonel and brevet brigadier general , and was retained in the service at the close of the war , filling a useful part in the negotiations which brought peace to the whites and Indians as well .

		The plainest of men , illiterate through most of his life , he was as efficient as he was modest .

		`` So this is the great
Kit Carson	PERSON	, who has made so many Indians run ! ''

		exclaimed a hero-wor - shipper to him one day .

		`` Yes , '' drawled Car - son ; `` sometimes I run after them but most times they war runnin ' after me . ''

		His mounted figure , done by
St. Gaudens	ORGANIZATION	, crowns the pioneer monument in
Denver	LOCATION	, but his best memorial is in the words of Colonel
Meline	PERSON	, written shortly before his death : '' I find that he is beloved and respected by all who know him , and his word is looked upon as truth itself . ''

		Mr.
Sabin	PERSON	has chosen an excellent subject , and treated it admirably .

		The economic The writing o f a detailed history progress of Russian economic develop - ment by a professor in an Amer - ican university would appear a bold under - taking one of those hazardous enterprises which can be justified only by being carried to completion with a conspicuous measure of success .

		It is pleasurable to record that , judged in accordance with all reasonable tests , Professor
James Mavor	PERSON	's `` Economic History of
Russia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- is a work which vindicates the author 's enthusiasm for his unusually difficult subject and his determina - tion to put the results of his researches into print .

		The chapters making up the two large volumes follow an order which is roughly chronological and cover the entire period from the beginning of Russian history to the close of the revolutionary movement of
1903-7	DATE	.

		A score of pages suffice , however , to record what there is to be said upon developments prior to the thirteenth century ; and of the two volumes , the second is devoted entirely to the period since the accession of Alexander I .

		The value of Professor
Mavor	PERSON	's book to En - glish and American students will arise princi - pally from the fact that it is based upon the work of Russian and other continental schol - ars who , in the past ten or fifteen years , have brought to light a multitude of new materials upon all phases of Slavic history and economic progress .

		In his earlier chapters the author makes large use of the writings of Professor Kluchevsky , and despite the fact that this authority 's notable `` History of
Russia	LOCATION	'' has now been made available for English readers , there is much additional matter of value in those chapters by Professor Mavor which most nearly reproduce the chapters of Klu - chevsky .

		The treatment given the more re - cent aspects of the subjects of agriculture and capitalism and industry , the social democratic movement , the actual condition of the peas - antry on the eve of the war with
Japan	LOCATION	, and the revolutionary movement beginning in the south Russian strike of
1903	DATE	is not likely soon to be surpassed in a work in English .

		It is the author 's conclusion that , notwithstanding the reaction by which the late revolution was followed , the economic and political history of the country has entered upon a new phase ; that `` the
Duma	ORGANIZATION	, with all its defects , has be - come a school in which a new generation of competent rulers may be trained '' ; and that the nation has changed abruptly from one in which constructive , as well as destructive , criticism was sternly suppressed to one in which criticism of every sort abounds and is comparatively free .

		Several tricks of the trade are revealed by Mr.
Arnold Ben	PERSON	- nett in a series of interesting articles on the profession of writing , pub - lished under the title of `` The Author 's Craft '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		First of all , in order to see and record life properly , he outlines a game of observation as highly stimulating -LRB- and as exhausting -RRB- as his game , already familiar to many , of living on twenty-four hours a day . ' '

		Had one eyes , ' ' he suggests , ' ' the tying of a bootlace is the reflection of a soul . ''

		Few dis - cover it .

		The role of observer is too often passive instead of active ; the habit of looking without seeing is persistent .

		In the chapter dealing with play-writing , there is nothing startling or new in his assertion that the process of writing a novel differs from the process of writing plus producing a play ; incidentally , though , it furnishes him an op - portunity to disclose methods of collaboration which are a part of the history of every suc - cessful play .

		He finds that it is easier to write a play than a novel , a sonnet than an epic .

		Such comparisons seem futile .

		And is it not a platitude this insisting that ' ' other things being equal , a short work of art pre - sents fewer difficulties than a longer one '' ?

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 345 Other things being equal but they seldom are !

		In `` Writing Novels '' the equipment of the novelist is made to consist of a sense of beauty , passionate intensity of vision , and fineness of mind ; some of the fundamental rules of technique are presented ; as a whole , the chapter contains a wealth of illuminating comment of value to the amateur novelist .

		The last of the four papers should have been entitled `` Writer and Public '' or `` How the Writer Becomes Popular '' and not `` Artist and Public . ''

		In his finest moments of crea - tive inspiration , no artist is making a bid for popularity .

		All second-rate writers do , and their demand for it is immediate .

		Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- nett defines a `` pot-boiler '' as the sort of work `` done against the grain because the public appreciates it . ''

		Quite justly he suggests that a man who produces literary wares for the express purpose of selling them should have an aptitude for merchantry .

		But why make the same unqualified demand of the artist ?

		Is it dilettante to hope that a man may be a true artist though he fails to see the connec - tion between art and money ?

		If so , then what taboo shall be placed on an occasional member of the opposite type the prosperous man of affairs who may happen to aver , honestly and unabashed , that his is not the talent to see the connection between money and art ?

		To attempt to fit the two types into one mould , would be delightfully absurd .


America	LOCATION	, stained through many city-buiidi ^ g 0f 7 ears with the travail of bring - ing a continent to terms , is be - ginning to wipe away some of the evidences of her arduous labors and to deck herself in more becoming attire than she has heretofore had time for .

		Her people begin to recognize in architecture something more than the old farmer saw , who always thanked God when it rained that houses are built hollow .

		From architecture they are even going to the con - sideration of the surroundings in which edi - fices public and private must be placed and arriving at a community sense of beauty a vast step beyond mere individual interest , however enlightened .

		To this end Mr.
Frank Koester	PERSON	, consulting civic engineer , has pre - pared a large and beautiful volume , `` Modern City Planning and Maintenance '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , in which are embodied the principles of the new art which is his profession , abundantly illustrated with reproduced photographs from European and American cities to show results already attained .

		The art of building beautiful cities , in spite of such exceptional cases as those of L ` Enfant in
Washington	LOCATION	and
Haussmann	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION	, appears to have been lost , though perfectly understood in both ancient and mediseval times , until its re - vival in
Germany	LOCATION	in the seventies .

		There are to be found the largest number of instances of the deliberate intention of municipalities to make themselves attractive , both to those inhabiting them and to visitors ; in this con - nection such a question as this is fairly startling to an American : ' ' Who ever goes to
Jersey City	LOCATION	, a larger city than Diisseldorf ; to
Nashville	LOCATION	, greater than
Athens	LOCATION	; to
Detroit	LOCATION	, with a larger population than
Rome	LOCATION	; to
St. Louis	LOCATION	, almost the equal of
Budapest	LOCATION	; to Chi - cago , greater than
Vienna	LOCATION	or
Berlin	LOCATION	; to
Balti	LOCATION	- more or
Pittsburg	LOCATION	, superior to
Dresden	LOCATION	; to
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, larger than
Antwerp	LOCATION	, or to any of a score of American cities , to see any sights worth seeing ? ''

		It is pointed out that this is a prime reason why Americans have no marked desire to `` see
America	LOCATION	first '' ; upon the whole there is nothing but natural scen - ery worth seeing .

		But a hundred cities in the
United States	LOCATION	have been awakened al - ready , and a better future awaits them all .

		To an end so desirable such a book as this should contribute greatly , for it contains everything that can aid so excellent a cause , by precept in its text , by example in its illustrations .

		Some books need a preface ex - The first number nlfliniriP ' tlipir pvistpnpp flnrl of a new annual .

		V l * -RSB- 1U C6 > AUL Lucas Annual is one of these .

		For many a delighted reader may with good reason want to know just how the editor , Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, happened to make himself responsible for so quaintly charming a volume as this in contents , a periodical , with old - fashioned covers of sombre cloth .

		Several prominent living English writers are among the contributors .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	writes of `` Fairyland , '' describing creatures who have `` such magical loveliness as makes the hearts of mortals ache '' ; Mr.
Hugh Walpole	PERSON	fur - nishes a `` human interest '' story ; Messrs.
Dobson	PERSON	,
Hewlett	PERSON	, and
Bramah	PERSON	, as well as Sir
James Barrie	PERSON	and `` Saki , '' are represented ; the editor makes a sympathetic contribution of a slender page .

		Chapters from the novel `` Spoof '' are from the pen of Mr.
Stephen Leacock	PERSON	, narrating the adventures of an En - glishman in
New York	LOCATION	, who , on the day he stumbles upon the first clue to a mysterious secret , breathlessly telephones to his hotel the Belmont not to keep lunch waiting for him .

		`` Anon , '' whose name has found its way into a calendar over which the proof-reader nodded -LRB- letting an awkward d , instead of a & , stand guiltily before the year of his birth -RRB- , speculates in a whimsical way on what expe - 346 THE DIAi , -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	riences would really have been his , had he lived in the earlier decades to which some compositor 's hurry had assigned him .

		Mr.
John Drinkwater	PERSON	, on the other hand , inter - ested in a gray old scavenger , scorns the world 's progress : '' You and this and that man , All of you are making things that none of you would lack , And so your eyes grow dusty , and so your limbs grow rusty But mad
Tom Tatterman	PERSON	puts nothing in his sack . ''

		There are hitherto unpublished letters of
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Buskin	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	's `` A Castigation '' being , in the words of the editor , one of the finest examples we have in the literature of remonstrance and chastise - ment .

		Besides , there still remain another half-dozen contributors , whose names have not even been mentioned .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Stories of redeemed criminals .

		The story of a
Jean Valjean	PERSON	, simply and straightforwardly told , is one of the most likely sorts of stories to command the listener 's at - tention .

		Mr.
Peter Clark MacFarlane	PERSON	has collected the biographies of eight `` crooked '' characters less known to the great world than
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's famous convict , but each and all of a marked individuality and , like Jean Val - jean , appealing by their still unspoiled man - hood to the humanity of the reader .

		`` Those Who Have Come Back '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- concerns itself , as the title indicates , with those who , after going astray , have re - gained the straight path ; and in most in - stances they have shown themselves eager to help other wrong-doers to reform .

		A forger , a burglar , a counterfeiter , a drunkard , and other less easily classifiable victims of com - bined heredity and circumstances , are pre - sented in life-like guise , and are either made to relate their own memorable experiences or have the narrative put into the third person by the sympathetic biographer .

		Whether it is all literal truth , one may pardonably ques - tion .

		Certain real characters and certain real incidents undoubtedly inspire the writer 's pen , and if there is a tendency to trim and polish now and then , it is no more than lit - erary art seems to demand .

		In one chapter , for example , presenting the harrowing expe - rience of a woman who has cured herself of the morphine habit for it should be noted that two of the book 's characters are women a suspicion of something like fiction is engen - dered by the story-teller 's lack of consistency in making the aforesaid habit one of ten years ' duration on one page , and of twenty - five years ' on another .

		An occasional unusual word or unorthodox spelling distracts the critical reader 's attention from the narrative , as where `` rehabitate '' is used in the sense of rehabituate , and '' cachination '' is made to do duty for cachinnation .

		Four illustrations add to the interest of these touching tales .

		We all have bodies , and we are toMag l e. e all interested in their preserva - tion .

		Hence the universal ap - peal of such a book as Dr.
Henry Smith Williams	PERSON	's `` Adding Years to Your Life '' -LRB-
Hearst 's International Library Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which is made up of popular articles on hygiene that have already found favor with magazine - readers .

		They deal with the problem of longevity , the battle of the microbes , how to outwit the messengers of death , the health of the brain , the condition of the nerves , the care of the eyes , and the rearing of children .

		Touching briefly on Professor
Metchnikoff	PERSON	's sour-milk treatment for the prolongation of life , a treatment that had its origin only a comparatively short time ago , the author says : `` It must be admitted , however , that the results of this treatment have not been convincing to the mass of the profession . ''

		But how should they be convinced so soon ?

		Give Dr.
Metchnikoff	PERSON	a century or so , and who knows but he will prove his point ?

		Chief among the simple means for prolonging our life would seem to be care in eating and the taking of daily exercise .

		But how many even of those that read the book will give proper attention to these matters ?

		As the author says in conclusion , ' ' the great difficulty is that most people can not be induced to shut the barn door until after the horse is stolen . ''

		When the pen of a
Silvio Pellico	PERSON	or a Dostoieffsky turns to the portrayal of prison life from the inside , the result is pretty sure to be a vivid and soul-stirring piece of literary art .

		in which , however , art is so far subordinated to nature and reality that no thought of the craftsman 's skill is present in the reading .

		A narrative of experience behind stone walls and iron bars from the son of the author of `` The Scarlet Letter '' offers at the outset strong hope of something extraordinarily in - teresting , and in ' ' The Subterranean Brother - hood '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , by Mr.
Julian Hawthorne	PERSON	, the reader will not be disappointed in his ex - pectation of an engrossing bit of autobiog - raphy .

		The chain of events that led to Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	's year of residence at
Atlanta	LOCATION	as a guest of the government is already too well known to call for recapitulation so well
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 347 known , in fact , that the author himself barely alludes to the circumstances , and that chiefly by way of passing comment on the absurdity of the notion that he is a desperate criminal whose personal freedom endangered the pub - lic welfare .

		What he concerns himself with is the penal system in general , and as illustrated in the
Atlanta	LOCATION	penitentiary in particular ; and he also touches on certain absurdities of our legal machinery as they present them - selves to a shrewd observer in our criminal courts .

		That prison reform still has much to accomplish even after the much that it has already accomplished , is undeniable , and this truth is emphasized by the wealth of indi - vidual experience and observation contained in Mr.
Hawthorne	PERSON	's gruesomely interesting book ; but that prisons themselves should be abolished and the very term `` criminal '' be expunged from the language , is not so self - evident at present .

		Yet this is what the author urges , and if practice would only har - monize with theory his argument would be unanswerable .

		At any rate , his book is a notable and should prove a not unfruitful ` contribution to the literature of penology .

		For many years the entomolo - t H.BWI , ji/co .

		.

		- - .

		of the orchard gists oi our agricultural experi - and vineyard .

		stat j ons nave conducted Insect foes investigations of the various insects which invade orchards , destroy berry crops , and infest vineyards at the expense of the horti - culturist .

		The probable total annual loss in this country from this cause has been esti - mated by Dr.
Quaintance	PERSON	to be over
sixty millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		The leading centre for this investigation has been the station at Cor - nell
University	ORGANIZATION	in conjunction with the
New York State College of Agriculture	ORGANIZATION	.

		The re - sults of the work have been assembled by the late Professor
M. V. Slingerland	PERSON	and com - pleted by his colleague , Professor
C. R. Crosby	PERSON	, in a `` Manual of Fruit Insects '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work is a richly illustrated handbook of the insects affecting the apple , pear , quince , plum , peach , and cherry , and the various berries , such as raspberry , blackberry , dewberry , currant , gooseberry , and strawberry , and also the grape and cranberry .

		The closing chapter deals with the preparation and appli - cation of insecticides .

		The work is complete , thorough , and accurate .

		It provides a very welcome compendium for both the fruit - grower and the entomologist .

		The life his - tories of the various insects are described and figured so that the non-technical reader can make use of them , and the effects of the attacks of insects are in most cases fully illustrated .

		Illustrated in color and photogravure , includ - ing introductions of several pictures never before published .

		Limited edition of 300 copies on Dutch handmade paper , at
$ 12.50	MONEY	net .

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	estimates
Winslow Homer	PERSON	as `` the greatest of marine painters '' and `` one of the most remarkable per - sonalities in the art of this or any country in the latter part of the nineteenth century . ''

		His exposition of the various excellences which enabled Homer to rise to pre-eminence as a painter is as masterly as it is illuminating , and his description of the development of Homer 's art is both consistent and convincing .

		FREDERIC FAIRCHILD SHERMAN 1790 BROADWAY
NEW YORK	LOCATION	CITY The Death of a Nobody By
JULES ROMAINS	PERSON	A French masterpiece !

		With incomparable restraint and power it reveals the interwoven web of human relations , romantic from their very prosaicness .

		The life of one in others ' minds the `` social consciousness '' about which the soci - ologists have developed abstruse theories , is here portrayed explicitly , with a fascination no theory can have .

		The '' Nobody '' about whom the action revolves dies in the second chapter : then things begin to happen !

		Though fiction , it supplies disturbing thoughts to doubters of life after death .

		Certainly no character in fiction ever had a more definite existence than the '' Nobody '' after his body was lowered in the grave .

Desmond Mac	ORGANIZATION	-

		The actual results already attained by the logical-analytical method must be gathered from Mr.

Finally , in the most important chapters of the book , he lays before us the outline of a theory which may reconcile the world of physical science with the worlds of psychology and of common sense ...

		`` How can philosophy become scientific ?

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's answer is , in a word , that it can only do so by recog - nising that all philosophical problems are purely logical and by adopting a reformed logic ...

		396 `` LE THEATRE MANQUE . ''

		Nearly every one is agreed that the theatre is not so vigorous and healthy a part of our life as it should be .

		Indeed , nearly every one has been agreed on that for ten years .

		But hardly any two critics are agreed as to what is the matter .

		No art has had so many physi - cians , or such willing and earnest ones , in the past decade as the theatre has .

		The result seems to be that the protests of those who are interested in the theatre have been rather more serious in the year just closing than they ever were before .

		Commercial managers frankly bewail the loss of the great paying audience that once was theirs .

		Theatre-goers complain bitterly that there is no longer any - thing worth seeing on the stage .

		Authors as - sert at least as roundly as they did ten years ago that their best work is ignored by the producers .

		Lecturers assure us that they do these things better abroad but that we only need repertory companies like those of Man - chester and
Glasgow	LOCATION	, or a movement like that of the Irish National Theatre , or actors like those of the Theatre Francais , or an audience like that of the
Odeon	LOCATION	, or a scale of prices like that of the New Folk Theatre in
Berlin	LOCATION	, or a sophisticated society like that of
Vienna	LOCATION	, to have a living art of the theatre .

		Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	would approve a civic theatre and pageants ; the Messrs.
Shubert	PERSON	would decapi - tate all the critics now writing for the
New York	LOCATION	papers ; the various attempts to im - prove on the commercial theatre would accept large additions to their subsidies .

		And mean - while the
Drama League of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, turning from the study of printed and acted plays to observe what is going on in the world , has ar - ranged a winter programme almost exclusively devoted to one aspect or another of the mov - ing-picture theatre .

		Perhaps the
League	ORGANIZATION	feels that the anaemia which has resisted so many tonics is better abandoned for a robustness that never required any !

		But though the apathy so succinctly ex - pressed by the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	is apparently general , there are exceptions .

		One of these is Mr.
Hiram Kelly Moderwell	PERSON	, who has just written a book , `` The Theatre of To-day , '' full 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	of studiously acquired information about the work that was being done in
Europe	LOCATION	before the war began and full of delight in the re - sults of it .

		His first chapter contains these paragraphs : '' Ten years ago this book would have been writ - ten entirely about dramatic literature .

		At that time we thought of the institution of the theatre as being a collection of printed plays together with a few necessary buildings to present them in .

		... '' Now all this is changed .

		From an institution of one art the theatre has become in the space of less than ten years , an institution of all the arts . ''

		Not that the theatre suddenly found its possi - bilities ... But the realization began to spread that the theatre was not merely an affair of spoken words and accompanying gestures .

		And suddenly , almost overnight , the thinkers saw the possibilities of universality in the theatre , and set out to develop them slowly , tentatively , but in a spirit of conse - cration which has given a largeness and dignity perhaps beyond any other art of to-day . ''

		And he proceeds through many interesting pages to justify this statement by recording the achievements of German , French , Russian , and English artists and engineers of the theatre .

		Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	's enthusiasm over the For - tuny lighting system -LRB- especially when it is used in conjunction with a Kuppelhorizont -RRB- , the revolving , sliding , rolling , and wagon stages of the Germans , the buildings of Pro- fessor
Max Littmann	PERSON	-LRB- in which every specta - tor has a good seat -RRB- , the settings designed by Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	and
M. Golovine	PERSON	, the color - schemes of
M. Bakst	PERSON	, the atmosphere of Signer Appia , the inscenierung of
Herr Max Rein	ORGANIZATION	- hardt and Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	, is contagious .

		`` We can hardly read his pages without wishing to build a small model theatre with which to conduct endless experiments in setting and lighting a stage .

		The two
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	students who built a Kuppelhorizont in their room at
Cambridge	LOCATION	seem the most fortunate of men .

		Is not the stage picture at least as important as the easel picture ?

		And is not the art of light capable of as great development as the art of sound , which is music ?

		Furthermore , Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	points out that this new art new in its magnificence at least has already reached
America	LOCATION	.

		` He asserts that in
Boston	LOCATION	Mr.
Livingston Platt	PERSON	and Mr.
Josef Urban	PERSON	have already made settings that challenge those of the Europeans .

		In
Cambridge	LOCATION	Mr.
Samuel Howe	PERSON	has a studio which is that of an amateur only because American theatrical managers have not yet seen the possibilities of design and color on the stage .

		In the strictly commercial theatre Mr.
Robert E. Jones	PERSON	and Mr.
J. Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	, Americans both , have made artistic settings .

		Mr.
Moderwell	PERSON	asks us to believe that such men as these will soon be numerous in
America	LOCATION	.

		We do believe it .

		We believe that the time has almost arrived when men utterly ignorant of color , and utterly incapable of design , and utterly unwilling to study the possibilities of the theatre as a medium of artistic expression will no longer plan the more important dra - matic productions in this country .

		But we do not believe the second part of Mr.
Moder	PERSON	- well 's syllogism .

		We do not believe that the most perfect artists of inscenierung imagina - ble will redeem the theatre in
America	LOCATION	.

		For the whole institution of the theatre exists for the purpose of presenting to an audience `` spoken words with their accompanying gestures . ''

		It does not exist in order that architects may design admirable buildings for its audiences ; it does not exist that painters may design beautiful settings for its stage : it does not exist that mechanical engineers may construct ingenious devices for its direc - tors ; and it does not exist that amateurs may play with lights and shadows on a
Kuppel	LOCATION	- horizont .

		All these persons are secondary .

		They are inessential .

		They are all very well as long as they are of use to the dramatist and all very wrong when they interfere with him .

		They have nothing to give us except as they give it through the dramatist .

		We shall never have a living art of the theatre until we have living dramatic authors .

		For the present , we may interest a few with performances of Euripides or astound our - selves with
Mazda	ORGANIZATION	lamps , as the
Chicago Little Theatre	ORGANIZATION	has done ; we may import the plays of
J. M. Synge	PERSON	and the Irish actors who so admirably speak them , as the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	has done ; we may publish bulletins inferior to the causeries of the newspaper crit - ics of the plays we least dislike , as the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	in many cities has done .

		But we may not go to the theatre to see dramas springing directly out of our own time and our own life put upon the stage .

		The reason is not that we have the long-run system , or that our man - agers will do everything for money and noth - ing for anything else , or that we have no
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	.

		The reason is that we have no dramatists .

		That is the weakness of the thea - tre in
America	LOCATION	, and the only weakness that supremely counts .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 371 THE CRITICS OF CRITICISM .

		`` Criticism , '' says Mr.
Brownell	PERSON	in a char - acteristic , pregnant sentence , `` criticism itself is much criticized , which logically establishes its title . ' '

		Some years ago Mr.
John McKinnon Robertson	PERSON	very neatly exposed the critics of criticism by revealing this same paralogism in their noisy remonstrances .

		Yet these tinsel Lucifers still swarm in the world .

		And , like the Baconians , with whom they have many points in common , they must be met with something more than a scornful Olympian silence .

		As Professor Bliss
Perry	PERSON	has shown , in two recent articles much-discussed , they have their real grievances in abundance .

		From the days when Swift , himself a critic or noth - ing , cried out against the wretched hack - writers of his craft , `` Kill the rats , '' to the days when
William Morris	PERSON	grumbled , `` To think of a beggar making a living by selling his opinion about other people , '' there have been causes a plenty for scev a indignatio from `` artists . ''

		But their real reason for attack - ing critics lies in the fact that they , their friends , and their masters have been thumbed over by blinking criticasters .

		Why not , then , deny to poetry the right to exist on the same basis , because
Shadwell	PERSON	, and Tate , and White - head , and
Pye	PERSON	, and Tupper grated on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw verses as flat and insipid as their names ?

		The great critic is as rare as the great poet and as eminent .

		But every one who seriously proposes to be a rich-spirited citizen of the world can and must toe poetical and critical .

		The critics of criticism , then , must not utter their bitter whims if by chance they have any relic of respect for logic .

		But their con - demnation to silence on this score is more sweeping still .

		If they are poets and hate criticism , they must not talk about their poetry .

		For that is criticism .

		Indeed , they must not show , even by a scornful lift of an eyebrow or a delighted flash of the eyes , their contempt or their admiration for the work of a brother bard .

		For these things are criticism .

		Whistler 's desire that his paintings be re - ceived in silence should have been more fully worked out into its solemn absurdity .

		Let us imagine an ideal audience for these impatient poets and novelists , sculptors , musicians , archi - tects , and painters .

		These connoisseurs would move about the long halls of a gallery staring with studious blankness at the pictures , with ghostly footfalls , and arms laboriously limp and motionless , with faces as pallid and strange as those which may be seen in the drawings of certain cheap and insincere imi - lators of the admirable post-impressionists .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	turned the tables very happily on
Wordsworth	PERSON	in his critico-phobia .

		`` Is it certain , '' writes
Arnold	PERSON	, `` that Words - worth himself was better employed in making his Ecclesiastical Sonnets than when he made his celebrated Preface , so full of criticism , and criticism of the works of others ? ''

		There is a home-thrust for you !

		Many critics , nowa - days , are agreed with the poets that it is a dubious adventure for a versifier to fashion first , or accept , a Procrustean mould of canon and then attempt to pour into it his mercurial imaginings .

		But suppose
Wordsworth	PERSON	had written and talked more prefaces and then applied them in revision to his `` Excursion . ''

		Well , that may be asking too much from
Wordsworth	PERSON	and any other established and illustrious poet .

		But observe that singers and novelists and indolent readers who are most fearful or contemptuous of criticism are often those who most sadly need it .

		They may have been burned in effigy by some futile criticaster .

		They may have been taught to hate a good book by some professor of English literature who is allowed through the ignorance , tol - erance , or indifference of regents or trustees to remain at his post and desecrate it .

		But if these railers against all criticism are still young and still plastic , let them look to the real critics and let them try to be critics them - selves .

		We know such a young poet , a scoffer of critics , who has published a good deal of promising work , whose spirit is ' ' apprehensive , quick , forgetive , full of nimble fiery and de - lectable shapes . ''

		He is fond of voicing the old absurdity that a critic is an abortive and disappointed artist .

		To take one instance of his abuse , we may remark that his attitude toward
Walter Pater	PERSON	is expressed in a ridic - ulous , unquotable phrase , the only justifica - tion for which lies in its really vigorous , if meaningless , obscenity .

		He has been strongly influenced by two poets of recent days , both admirable taken singly , but exceeding dan - gerous in combination .

		His verse , volatile , often stirring , sometimes noble , tends , at times , to harden too readily into a kind of rhetorical lava and to become very thin .

		He has all the marvellous gifts and faces all the deadly perils of improvisation .

		His lines glitter but seldom glow .

		At worst he falls to jingling .

		But he has one rare and highly poetic quality which ought to save him magnanimity .

		And when his magnanimity impels him to think with more charity of criti - cism he will be a richer poet than he now dares hope to be .

		The prejudice against criticism is probably largely due to the fact that it is a parvenu among the other artistic genres .

		People forget 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	the late birth of other forms , that after the epic , the lyric , the tragedy , and the comedy had been perfected in Greek literature the novel began to emerge in the rather hectic and amorphous work of Heliodorus ,
Achilles Tatius	PERSON	, and others ; that in
England	LOCATION	the great dramas were synchronous with the novel in its nonage , ' ' Doctor Faustus ' ' with ' ' Menaphon , ' ' `` Love for Love , '' a marvel of structure and dialogue , '' with the vivid and racy and im - mortal but elementary `` Colonel Jack '' ; that the novel reached perfection with Fielding only when poetry grew spectre thin and fell dead .

		We have said that great critics are as rare as great poets .

		And as we call the meagre roll of supreme critics we realize that fully a third of them belong to the last hundred out of the many thousand years that have marched silently with the human race .

		Let us all be wary of Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	's sug - gestive but dangerous definition of criticism as merely what men `` have said about litera - ture . ''

		We should count Plato among the critics -LRB- although he is claimed also by the philosophers with perfect justice and , almost as plausibly , by some poets , by
Shelley	PERSON	, for instance , in his `` Defense of Poetry '' -RRB- and hail the imperial Greek as the supreme master .

		After Plato we find that among the half-dozen greatest critics from
Aristotle	LOCATION	to
Lessing	LOCATION	, while there is luminous thought , there is seldom the magic that we call style .

		Perhaps Aristotle 's style in his finished work was greater even than
Plato 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		But of this we know nothing .

		In the mellow but sometimes overripe work of Cicero the style is rich but , after all , too studied , not quite the man .


Dryden	PERSON	has style , but that was because he anticipated some of the methods of the critics who came when criticism first asserted itself as a genre .


Dryden	PERSON	, in other words , could be impressionist as well as judicial critic .

		It was impressionism , as it appears in solution with other methods in work as different as that of the alert portrait-maker , Sainte-Beuve , and the divine chit-chat of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, that gave to critics the exhilaration , the suave fluidity , the curious incisiveness , the splendor -LRB- if we re - member Taine , for all his formulae -RRB- , the glow , which we call style .

		For impressionism began , more fitfully and more soberly , before the days of
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	and
Jules Le	PERSON	- maitre .

		And , though we may well hold austere vigil over the wonder-working caprices of the impressionist , we owe to his delicately lawless blend of authentic fire with his delightful and vexatious cajolery a new substance which has filled the dry veins of the old methods of criticism with something light and bright like quicksilver , not blood but ichor , the sap of art and immortality .

		All our great Victorians are at present the storm-centres of fierce blame and passionate lauds , and it may seem to many quite futile to prophesy in the midst of these murky clouds and capricious lightnings .

		Yet we dare assert that because of the new life which came into criticism , which gave it a sense of liberation and the magic of style , the great Victorian critics , men like
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, will emerge from the storm more ma - jestic with their scars , as lofty and mountain - massive as men like
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Their heresies were great .

		But observe that -LRB- for all their narrownesses -RRB- they were freer than any of the poets of their period from the curse of Victorianism , from idealism of the whipped-cream variety .

		Let economist and painter and architect and poet strip away the last bright shred of charlatanism and warped absurdity from them ; their magisterial robes , shaken free by wholesome scorn of the more tawdry habiliments with which they half sub - merged their own true grandeur , will appear the more opulent and stately .

		And for their Promethean audacities they will be released from the
Caucasus	LOCATION	and placed among the gods .

		Whether the poets , painters , novelists , acad - emicians , and self-sufficient readers like it or not , criticism , the new genre , has already won the heights and is ennobled among the fine arts in the book that registers eternal values .

		It remains for the critics themselves -LRB- careless of the old charge of arrogance which has always been urged against them -RRB- to dynamite those two mildewed and fallacious conceptions : the fata
Morgana	PERSON	of a belief that there is an antithesis between criticism and creation , the pernicious half-truth that criticism is at two removes from life .

		To give the quietus to the outworn and mischievous antithesis between criticism and creation we must , like
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's Britomart , see everywhere writ over the portals in the Daedalian halls of our castle of strange adventure , `` Be bolde , '' `` Be bolde , '' and yet also , `` Be not too bolde . ''

		We must not in our arrogance jettison the old sane and pene - trating ways of judging and admonishing that the critics learned with so many centuries of toil .

		Professor
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	has given us a weighty and memorable exhortation to blend judicial and impressionistic methods .

		His warning and his ideal are likely to have a permanent importance for us .

		On the other hand , we must be bolder than
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, who admitted an antithesis between criticism and creation .

		For in the prose of
Arnold	LOCATION	, that Olympian turned to stone in mid-youth , we shall observe , in his timorous shrinking from that lyrical intimacy and rich wistfulness THE DIAL 373 which gave us a few precious paragraphs like the close of his introduction to his ' ' Essays in Criticism '' and the opening of his essay on
Emerson	LOCATION	, we shall observe in this pseudo - stoical restraint the disastrous effect of his belief in the antithesis between criticism and creation .

		We shall understand that our poet friend had caught part of the truth -LRB- but not the whole truth -RRB- when he maintained that criticism exercised a desiccating influence over
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		We must be more truly bold than
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, whose apparent para - dox that the critic is more creative than the artist is really nothing but a clever epigram - matic precis of the first part of
Arnold	LOCATION	's `` The Function of Criticism at the Present Time , '' which supports a thesis that before the `` cre - ative power '' begins to work richly , sanely , and for all time there must always be great criticism to provide it `` with elements , with materials '' which criticism has made , or , in
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's skilful turn of the phrase , ' ' created . ' '

		Wilde , then , really saw an inconsistency in
Arnold	LOCATION	and in his foes .

		But the young hedonist was too perversely defiant ; he sold his soul to snap at what he thought was a paradox .

		To be sure , real paradoxes are fonts of wisdom .

		But what of quasi-paradoxes ?

		We must not be too bold , but we must be bolder than Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	, who , in his dis - tinguished essay entitled `` Criticism , '' would assign the critic a certain pre-eminence by placing a Cicero above a Saint
Paul	PERSON	,
Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	above Luther .

		We need not thus refer the matter to Dionysius and his grandiose scales .

		Let us compare the ways of the poet with those of the critic without thought of superi - ority or inferiority .

		And let us ask once more whether there is any real antithesis between criticism and creation , whether it is really suggestive to describe criticism as at two re - moves from life .

		In a certain grove there is a quiet pool .

		To this go many of us who are laymen and one who is a poet .

		We laymen watch the sun-shafts strike the pool and grow meditative over the changing shadows .

		We say nothing , or we struggle with some banality , or we abuse some adjective whose mintage has been worn smooth by irreverent and blunder - ing thumbs , or we explode with a bit of grace - less slang .

		The poet writes a lyric .

		As we read it we cry : `` This utters what we felt but could not say ; and it is divinely colored , moreover , with the unique personality of the singer . ''

		Then we add that it is a good poem , that it is `` beautiful , '' `` stunning , '' `` bully , '' '' damned fine '' ; or , perhaps , we read it with - out a word .

		Then comes the critic who shat - ters our ideal with wholesome disillusion if the poem is bad , who praises it if it is good and writes about it a paragraph so magical , so eloquent , that it gives us a new ecstasy . ' '

		This is what we were ` with child ' to say , '' we ex - claim .

		We are delighted , too , with what we could not have said had we been articulate , the glamour of the other individual .

		Wherein does the paragraph differ from the poem as creation ?

		The critic is , you rejoin , at two removes from life .

		Why not say that his criticism is life sublimated ?

		Moreover , criti - cism can never be at two removes from life and sound criticism 's deepest notes .

		If you write a book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, you must not only try to interpret the recesses of his mind , the long avenues of his vision through his plays , to reveal a person far more real than many of his contemporaries , and yours , who are con - sidered legitimate material in art ; but you must make contrasts and comparisons from your first-hand observations of life about you .

		If you write about
Spenser	PERSON	's Sir
Artegall	PERSON	, the giant , and the mob , you will do well if you remember vividly the hours you spent on some city street watching the lean , eager , unshaven profiles of laborers and listening to the fierce accents of a speaker for the `` International Workers of the World . ''

		If you would de - lineate
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's Radigund and Britomart , you had best be able to say something about later-day feminism .

		If you grow ardent over the splendid vision of imperialism shadowed forth in `` The Faerie Queene , '' you should weigh Spenser as prophet by thinking of the spacious growth of her empire in later cen - turies and then of her terrific entanglement with
Triple Entente and Triple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		And as
Marlowe	PERSON	took his portrait of Faustus partly from an old book and partly from his observa - tions of some crony , some `` university wit , '' so you will make your portrait of
Marlowe	PERSON	out of his works , his life , and verify and vivify your material out of your penetrating glances at your neighbors , your casual glimpses of strangers from far lands , your friends , your foes .

		Finally , English criticism need not go in russet ; it may well flush to a sudden splendor as in woods over night in a soft rain and in a brisk frost at smoky dawn in
October	DATE	.

		And the work of a true critic is a wizardry that can make an audience as children , saucer-eyed before a teller of tales , a pied piper .

		In these days he must not be , as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, in a mood of inconsistent petulance , once pronounced him : one who ' ' has condemned whatever was , from time to time , fresh and vital in litera - ture . ' '

		Eather he is , in the fine phrase of Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	, a `` torch-bearing out-rider . ''

		Remember Baudelaire on
Wagner	PERSON	.

		The critic is as adventurous as the poet .

		He is lighted 374 -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	- on his happy journey , now by shy stars visible only to him , now by the rich lanterns of the galleon-moon which seems to ride buoyantly over the endless , soft , and sullen seas of space on an infinite voyage like his own .

		Like the dreamer in `` The Critic as Artist , '' he walks by moonlight and his punishment and his reward is to see the dawn before the rest of the world .

		HERBERT
ELLSWORTH CORY	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		CONSPIRACIES OP SILENCE , or what seem to be such , on the part of those who make our reference books , must have been noted by every habitual user of those indispensable literary tools .

		Almost beyond belief is the unanimity with which the most important and , one would think , the most easily obtain - able information on a given subject is some - times withheld by all the encyclopaedias and dictionaries and yearbooks and other reposi - tories of general intelligence .

		For example , the writer of this had occasion a few days ago to need a brief and definite statement of the period of Roman history covered by the five extant books of
Polybius	ORGANIZATION	's forty-book histori - cal work .

		Having no copy of Polybius at hand , he turned with confidence to
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's `` Classical Dictionary , '' school edition ; but though an article of reasonable length is there devoted to the historian , and though the scope of his entire work is indicated and the sur - vival of the first five books is stated , no men - tion is made of the period covered by those books .

		However , this was considered pardon - able , though a little surprising , in an elemen - tary reference book .

		Recourse was next had to the new and much - vaunted ' ' Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' where a four-column account of Polybius at once offered cheering promise of the desired aid .

		But it was a fallacious promise .

		With tiresome particularity every - thing except the one little point required was found duly set forth by the erudite writer : the character and scope of the history , with criticism of its style and comparison with other similar works , and a statement of what proportion of the whole was extant , were properly placed before the reader , and every now and then the writer seemed on the point of giving , as he could have done in three words , the one item of information sought for ; but somehow , with admirable ingenuity , he always succeeded in avoiding the issue .

		Then the large and excellent classical diction - ary published by the Harpers , and edited by the late Professor
Peck	PERSON	, was consulted , with exactly the same result as before .

		After that
Anthon	PERSON	and the `` Encyclopaedia Americana '' were pressed into service , and still other books of reference after them , but always to no pur - pose .

		If the compilers had met in formal conclave before entering upon their several tasks , and had signed a solemn compact to withhold this one piece of information , they could not have shown greater unanimity of secrecy on that subject .

		Doubtless there are many similar and even more tear-compelling tales of woe that other users of reference books could unfold if they chose .

		TREITSCHKE 's CASUISTRY is strikingly ex - emplified by some passages from his class - room lectures as quoted by Professor
Henry W. Farnam	PERSON	, of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, in `` The Yale Alumni Weekly . ''

		First , of the man himself he says that
Treitschke	PERSON	was `` a very large man , with a strong face and a decidedly impressive per - sonality , and the defect in his speech was due to deafness caused by sickness in his youth , in consequence of which he was unable to modulate his voice .

		It was indeed so diffi - cult for a beginner to understand him at all , that during the first half of the first lecture of his which I attended , I could not make out what he was talking about , and felt that I should have to give up the course .

		Then I suddenly found my ear attuned to his pecul - iarities , and in time the very defects of his elocution seemed to lend emphasis to what he said . ''

		From his notebook of thirty-seven years ago the writer quotes this fragment of a lecture : `` The purpose of the
State	ORGANIZATION	is power , and nothing can be more moral than this purpose .

		The statesman is often in a position to choose between two evils in order to maintain this highest good , but the diplo - matist lies -LRB- if he does it -RRB- for the advantage of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, while the merchant lies for his own advantage .

		The impulse of a youthful State to destroy an old and decaying
State	ORGANIZATION	is higher than all maxims of positive law .

		The statesman who acts unwisely is immoral . ''

		And in still more unmistakable terms : `` When a
State	ORGANIZATION	has the choice between the moral and the immoral it should choose the moral , for good faith is in politics a real power , but it is often possible to obtain a moral purpose only by immoral means , al - though not every moral purpose sanctifies immoral means . ''

		That this Jesuitical doc - trine , as well as other precepts inculcated by the lecturer , aroused occasional protest , ap - pears from further remarks of Professor Far - nam . ''

		The vigor of his -LSB-
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's -RSB- utter - ances often called forth strong opposition among the students , which they expressed , according to the German custom , by rubbing
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL the floor with the soles of their shoes .

		Al - though Treitschke was stone deaf , it seemed as if he must have felt these demonstrations in some way , possibly through the vibrations of the floor , for whenever one occurred , he would hit back with some oracular utterance like a sledgehammer , calculated to crush , if not to convince , his critics . ''

		The Treitschke leaven of a generation ago was evidently not deficient in ferment .

		THE ADHESIVE READER deserves a passing word .

		We have long had the gentle reader , the patient reader , the indulgent reader , the intelligent reader , and , more recently , the duck-back reader , or the reader who reads everything and retains nothing ; and now it is time we had an adjective to designate a certain well-known type of reader whose chosen haunt is the reading-room of public or semi-public character , and who contracts an incurable habit that suggests the propriety of dubbing him `` the adhesive reader . ''

		No matter how early or how late you seek your club reading-room or your public library reading-room , in the hope of snatching a five - minutes ' glance at your favorite daily paper or monthly magazine before proceeding on your way to more pressing concerns , the adhe - sive reader is there before you , stuck fast to the sheet you are so desirous of scanning , plodding laboriously through its successive columns , and making about as rapid progress as a fly crawling through a pot of glue .

		Two minutes , perhaps one minute , could at need be made to suffice for your quick mastery of all that the paper contains of importance ' of such meagre fragments of authentic war news , for instance , as you especially wish to glean and you may perhaps constrain your - self to wait with outward composure during four of your allotted five minutes , in the faint hope of out-staying the adhesive reader by one minute and so capturing for that brief space the object of your quest .

		But if by chance you have the joy of seeing his eye travel to the bottom of the last page , let not your heart exult prematurely ; he will still baffle you by turning back to read the paper -LRB- let us suppose it is the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' -RRB- all over again , or to absorb the advertisements and commit to memory the births , marriages , and deaths .

		If peradventure you catch him nodding over this task , think not to be able cautiously to remove his prey from his relax - ing clutch .

		He will be all alert at your first movement and will seem to take a malicious joy in your discomfiture .

		A clog to the read - ing-room machinery , he exults in his cloggish - ness .

		But is there no remedy ?

		As a tenta - tive suggestion , why not let every journal and magazine in a public reading-room have its appropriate sand-glass stationed near it , an hour-glass for each of the monthly magazines , a half-hour glass for the weeklies , a five - minute glass for the daily papers , and so on ?

		A custodian could start the sand to running as soon as a reader took possession of a jour - nal or periodical , and when the top of the glass became empty that journal or periodical would be subject to surrender upon request .

		Thus at last might we be relieved of the incubus of the adhesive reader .

		PUZZLES IN PRONUNCIATION abound in al - most any author-catalogue of our literature .

		Who is there that can without a single slip run through a list containing such doubtful or difficult names as
Behn	PERSON	,
Tautphceus	LOCATION	,
Houghton	LOCATION	,
Besant	PERSON	,
Palgrave	LOCATION	,
Beresford	LOCATION	, Sea - well ?

		Even at this late day the familiar names ,
Roosevelt	PERSON	, and
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	, and
Goethals	PERSON	, and
Loeb	PERSON	, are likely to be mispronounced .

		In order to remove doubt as to the proper pro- nunciation of a certain deservedly popular English author 's patronymic we quote from a letter written by Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	to Mr.
J. Walter Smith	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	correspondent of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript . ''

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	had asked Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	how he pronounced his name , and the answer runs : `` As to my name : It is one of those that to the end of time people will pronounce as sweet will moves them .

		It is an old
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	name and before my family migrated seventy to eighty years ago was pronounced with the A as in ' Wall ' and the S as Z .

		Some misguided person , I suppose my grandfather , yielding to the blandishments of the usual
London	LOCATION	pronunciation the A as in ` Gallon ' and the S as Z tolerated and adopted that pro- nunciation , which I dislike .

		I have gone back to the old .

		Viola . ' '

		There are those who hold that in order to derive real benefit from the study of a foreign language , even if one 's purpose is merely to read its literature intel - ligently , its proper pronunciation must first be mastered .

		It may not be strictly necessary to know the pronunciation of an author 's name before one can thoroughly enjoy and appreciate that author 's works ; but this knowledge is desirable and often very con - venient .

		THE MUSE OF THE `` MOVIES '' has her praises worthily sung in this year 's Hardy Prize Poem at
Williams College	ORGANIZATION	.

		While the theme is not the most exalted or heroic imaginable , the poet , Mr.
Charles William Brackett	PERSON	, of 376 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	the senior class , has shown himself not unsuc - cessful in making it productive of thought and imagery of no mean or paltry character .

		`` The New Muse '' is the poem 's title , with an explanatory sub-title .

		`` In Praise of the Movies . ''

		The muse 's shrine , her worship - pers , and some suggestive glimpses of the ceremonial within her temple , are presented in a dozen well-turned stanzas of eight lines each .

		As printed in `` The
Williams Alumni Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' the poem opens thus : '' Her shrine is a narrow darkened room A gleam of light through a powerful glass , A speeding wheel and a smooth white screen Where her pageants of shadows pass ; Shadows , but filled with a fire of life Treading the measures she bids them dance Mirth , Adventure , and Love and Death , The forms of a new Romance .

		`` And though they are tawdry and dim at times , Their robes but pitifully fine , This muse can number more worshippers Than all the haughtier nine .

		This wonderful lady , this high Romance Stepped down from the ivory hall To give herself to the humble folks For almost nothing at all . ''

		`` Her watchers , '' we are told , `` are one with the listeners to
Homer	ORGANIZATION	's stories of Troy , ' ' and after one `` has passed through the gate of the land of the stars , all for a five-cent fee , '' one `` returns to the trudging life of the little everyday with a soul that droops less wearily for the glimpse of far away . ''

		In closing tribute to the new muse , the poet sings : '' She gives great gifts to her worshippers , Merciful gifts without cease , To the weary the gift of f orgetfulness , To the troubled the gift of peace . ''

		Sterling even now is but a small village , of about a thousand in - habitants ; that it should have had a bookshop such as
Thomas	PERSON	's , or any bookshop at all , a century and a quarter ago , is remarkable .

		A PROSE EPIC IN FOUR BOOKS , the joint prod - uct of two boys ' literary efforts in one of the
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	classes , is winning deserved plaudits from an admiring public .

		In strength and simplicity of style it reminds one of the great classics , of the
Bible	LOCATION	and Homer , of the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	and the
Mahabha	LOCATION	- rata .

		And the brevity of it is not its least charm .

		We take the liberty to transcribe it in full .

		The theme is the making of the first
United States	LOCATION	flag , and the point or moral of the tale is obvious .

		`` Book One .

		Wunst the soldiers fighting King
George	PERSON	found out that they had to have a flag .

		The soldier that thought of it first said : ` Bill , we ai n't got no flag , ' and
Bill	PERSON	says it was so .

		Book Two .

		So they went to General
George Washington	PERSON	, the Father of His Country , and they says to
General Washington	LOCATION	, ` General
Washington	LOCATION	, we ai n't got no flag .

		Ai n't it fierce ? '

		And General
George Washington	PERSON	says , ` Yes , that 's so we ai n't got no flag .

		Ai n't it fierce ? '

		Book Three .

		So General
George Washing	PERSON	- ton , the Father of His Country , went to
Betsy Ross	PERSON	, who lived on the corner of
Beacon	LOCATION	and Chestnut streets , and General
Washington	LOCATION	says , `
Betsy	PERSON	, we ai n't got no flag .

		Ai n't it fierce ? '

		Book Four .

		And General
George Washington	PERSON	says , ` Ai n't it fierce ? '

		again three times .

		And
Betsy Ross	PERSON	she says , ' I shed say it is fierce ,
General Washington	LOCATION	, the
Father of His Country	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here , you hold the baby and I 'll make one . ' '

		AN AID TO LIBRARY EXTENSION , and un ques - tionably a very potent aid , would be a system of free delivery and return of books .

		Some
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 377 time ago there was introduced in the national
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, by
Congressman Green of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	, a bill for the amendment of section four hundred and forty-seven of the postal laws , as follows : `` Except books mailed by a public library to parties obtaining mail upon rural routes , running out of the city or town in which such library is situated , which books shall be admitted to the mails free both when so sent and when returned by parties residing on the rural routes to such public library . ''

		No announcement of the passage of this bill has yet made itself heard in the deafening headlines of our newspapers , and it is safe to infer that it still remains in its initial stage .

		Whether it is the proper busi - ness of the
United States	LOCATION	to relieve the sub - urbanite of the fatigue of going to town for his reading matter , may admit of argument ; but as long as it is the privilege of any and every congressman to send out at public ex - pense as many tons of his own speeches -LRB- in - cluding the unspoken ones -RRB- as he wishes , and even to make still more questionable use of the mail service , so long might that service with entire propriety be made to minister to the cause of culture in our rural communities .

		The ``
Iowa	LOCATION	Library Quarterly '' calls atten - tion to the great benefit likely thus to accrue in calling into being new libraries in thinly - settled districts already having rural deliv - ery .

		Passage of the bill would operate to increase the taxable area , so to express it , from which a country library would derive its support .

		THE ONE ENGLISHMAN APPRECIATIVE OF GERMAN CULTURE , so far as the much-quoted Professor Treitschke could determine , was
Carlyle	PERSON	who was a Scotchman .

		But to Treitschke he was `` the only Englishman who has thoroughly understood the Germans , and the first foreigner who has risen to the heights of German thought . ''

		At the other end of the scale in this eminent scholar 's estimation stood the renegade
Prince Albert	PERSON	, who was born and bred a German , but deliberately bartered his birthright for the hand of an English queen .

		All the bad things written by Treitschke about the hated islanders , years before the present international unpleasant - ness , would be terrible reading for an
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	if they were not almost comic in their exaggeration .

		A direct assault on the Amer - ican branch of Anglo-Saxondom is to be found in his treatise on `` The Beginnings of German Colonial Policy , '' in which he says : `` To civilization at large the Anglicizing of the German-Americans means a heavy loss .

		... Among Germans there can no longer be any question that the civilization of mankind suffers every time a German is transformed into a Yankee . ' '

		So robust a faith in the sur - passing merit of one 's own people and their particular brand of civilization is really splendid to contemplate .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		LITEKATUKE AND WAE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		If I understand Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's essay in THE DIAL of
October 1	DATE	, the writer , disgusted with certain popular stories , concludes that any upheaval is welcome which gives a prospect of their being superseded by another type of literature .

		What else can one understand from the plain statement that , '' If the war with its seriousness and terror will deliver us from such base conceptions of life as are voiced in such literary work , it will be worth its cost '' ?

		Because a critic 's aesthetic sense is outraged , the moral sense of the world may be outraged as an antidote .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	may be re - ferred to '' Thoughts on This War , '' which Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	contributes to the
November	DATE	number of '' Scribner 's Magazine '' : '' Culture is not scien - tific learning ; culture is not social method and iron discipline ; culture is not even power of producing and appreciating works of art though in these days you have not much of that ... Culture is natural gentility a very different thing . ''

		Thus Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	, who is never vulgar and who prob - ably does not care for Get-Rich-Quick
Wallingford	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's essay is interesting as giving an instance of the loose thinking of a certain class when they gird at the unfortunate peace advocate .

		To be sure he begins with disarming mildness : '' Perhaps it is bad taste for Americans , who are apparently set as spectators of the present tournament of nations , to speculate on the literary consequences of the world war .

		But after we have paid our tribute of horror and pity to what are probably the most ap - palling events of recorded history , our spirits must rise to the majesty of these occurrences ; we must feel that they indicate or portend a great change in human thought . ''

		It is pleasant to hear Mr.
Moore	PERSON	giving a passing sigh to the `` horror '' of the situation , else the reader might have supposed either that it has escaped his attention or that he has classed it all with the '' hysteria '' which he mentions in the next line .

		Most of us have not observed a great amount of hysteria .

		Horror there has been , and pity , among those who have imagination enough to grasp one-tenth of the misery involved ; and there has been a wave of righteous anger against the men who are responsible for this state of things ; but this is not necessarily hysteria .

		Perhaps Mr.
Moore	PERSON	means to class all peace talk in this cate - gory .

		As a matter of fact the general feeling seems to be no more in sympathy with peace at any price than it is with Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's jingoism .

		The prevailing sentiments are disgust and dismay at the war and its causes , and an equally strong desire to see the thing fought to a finish at what - ever cost .

		378 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's next paragraph contains a sentence which General von Bernhardi might have written : '' For ourselves vre think that this combative instinct is the glory of our race that it is a main force which keeps humanity from becoming dull , listless , enervated , and enslaved to sordid materiality . ''

		So many ideas crowd to the front on reading this sentence that it is difficult to keep them from toppling over one another .

		One remembers that the war was planned and precipitated by a country whose end was gain of a very material kind .

		One remembers that the palm for gallantry goes to the little peace-loving nation , a '' nation of market gardeners , '' which is not fighting for military glory but the homely virtue of self-respect , a nation which asks nothing better than to be let alone to mine and till , weave and forge , in the land of its fathers .

		Few deny the righteousness of some wars , but to welcome the present horror for its exhibitions of courage is rather like welcoming a religious persecution that reformers may show their mettle , or like filling a region with a ruffian soldiery to give young women an opportunity to prove their courage by suicide .

		To enjoy a good fight is one thing .

		Most of us do , women as well as men .

		But to cry up war as an end in itself is not only hideously immoral ; it is dangerous , since it is likely to land any people so obsessed just where
Germany	LOCATION	will sooner or later be .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	hails the day when the flat , stale , and unprofitable literature of domesticity shall be swept away by an avalanche of war literature . ''

		Poetry and war were one and indissoluble . ''

		But it is hardly just to lay all the sins of dullness and realism at the door of peace .

		To be sure , in war - time Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's despised '' average unimportant person '' is apt to lose individuality in the great herd of common soldiers and non-combatants , but the novels of ordinary people and happenings are the result of the ever-growing conviction of the worth of every life and every class .

		And here is another instance of Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's loose thinking .

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	comes in for his contempt , but he plays into his critic 's hand when he accuses her of superficiality .

		She was superficial .

		It is not because she deals with quiet happenings , but be - cause she never goes to the roots of things , that
Miss Austen	PERSON	, exquisite though she is , can not stand with the greatest .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	would have made out a better case for his war literature had he proved that '' The Newcomes '' or Scott 's own '' Heart of
Midlothian	LOCATION	'' is inferior to '' Ivanhoe '' or ''
Quentin Durward	PERSON	. ''

		And now I wonder that I have had the temerity to write this protest , for at such a time criticism from a woman , a creature incapable of `` great passions and thoughts , '' must seem an impertinence .

		But from the context I gather that the great pas - sion which most interests Mr.
Moore	PERSON	is the passion for war .

		Now it is only fair that that half of the human race which gets the most misery and the least glory out of a war should be heard when war is discussed .

		A woman is driven from place to place like a sheep .

		If she dares fight , as some of the Belgian women fought , in defence of her home , she receives none of the honors of a soldier , but is shot without ceremony .

		At all times she exists on sufferance .

		Sometimes in this year of grace she is outraged .

		Yet women , '' frail bodies and gentle minds '' notwithstanding , have rarely been behind - hand in patriotism .

		And I believe that most women as well as most men feel that , in this war at least , the way to peace is by the sword .

		But woe to him who exalts the sword as an idol .

		I read of towns devastated , of children starving , of beasts driven into barbed wire that cavalry may pass safely over their bodies , of young girls coming like hunted animals to the British rifle pits , and on top of all this I skim a chapter from a recent Avar novel .

		The chapter bears the uncompromising title of '' Rape . ''

		Then some amused demon within me laughs , for in my mind 's eye I see Mr.
Moore	PERSON	-LRB- with all his womenkind presumably safe in this sordid land -RRB- taking refuge in these glories from the contamina - tion of ''
Potash	ORGANIZATION	and
Perlmutter	PERSON	. ''

		THE YOUNG FRENCH POETS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In THE DIAL of
October 16	DATE	there is an interest - ing article on the dynamic movement in contem - porary French poetry .

		I should like to express my pleasure at the significant definition of the new tendency , while taking exception to what is a slight mislaying of emphasis .

		It should be clearly realized that the leading spirit in this movement is
M. Beauduin	PERSON	, rather than
M. Guilbeaux	PERSON	, for he is the most intensely national of all the dynamic French poets .

		M. Guilbeaux 's most important work bears the significant title , '' Modern
Berlin	LOCATION	, '' and though he can scarcely be called a disciple of M. Beau - duin , he is easily second to the latter as an inter - preter of French nationalism .

		Moreover , a close acquaintance with the younger poets who are just beginning to try their wings will show that they are enlisting under
M. Beauduin	ORGANIZATION	's banner .

		`` La Vie des Lettres '' has been the official organ of this movement which
M. Beauduin	PERSON	calls '' paroxysm , '' but which I prefer to call '' dynam - ism . ''

		Young
France	LOCATION	to-day is enrolling under the standard of
M. Paul Claudel	PERSON	or of
M. Nicolas Beauduin	PERSON	, according as it inclines to passive or to dynamic life .

		Its most significant expression is found in '' La Vie des Lettres '' or in '' La Nouvelle Revue Franc , aise , '' according as it follows M. Beau - duin or
M. Claudel	PERSON	. ''

		La Vie des Lettres '' has now been discontinued , as
M. Beauduin	PERSON	is fighting at the front , but he writes me that it will reappear after the war .

		The article by
M. Beauduin	ORGANIZATION	from which Mrs. von Ende quotes is printed in English in the
July	DATE	-
August	DATE	number of `` Poet Lore , '' with revisions by
M. Beauduin	PERSON	.

		It is the manifesto of the dynamic movement .

		It is supplemented by
M. Beauduin	PERSON	's article in the
September	DATE	number of '' The Poetry Journal . ''

		M. Beauduin 's most significant volumes , '' The City of Men '' and '' The Cosmogonic Man , '' are being translated into English .

		THE GREAT WAR .

		* The European war has produced a flood of literature of all sorts .

		England and
Germany	LOCATION	have published ' ' White Papers , ' '
Russia	LOCATION	, 41 Orange Papers , '' and
Belgium	LOCATION	, `` Gray Pa - pers , '' containing such portions of their offi - cial diplomatic correspondence as they sev - erally chose to make public in presenting their part in the negotiations resulting in war .

		A perusal , and still more a careful study , of these documents brings the conviction , not that any one nation is wholly in the wrong , but as each claims to be right that we need another and better standard of deter - mining what is right for a nation .

		This observation holds not only of the offi - cial publications but also of the increasing unofficial presentations of the several nations ' cases .

		These latter are already numerous .

		To
England	LOCATION	's defence come Sir
Edward Cook	PERSON	with a short summary entitled `` Why
Britain	LOCATION	is at War , ' ' and Mr.
J. M. Kennedy	PERSON	with the more extended `` How the War Began '' ; both rest on the documents of the British `` White Paper '' and the speeches of Britishers , the texts of which they reproduce in part .

		`` Why We Are at War :
Great Britain	LOCATION	's Case '' is issued by the members of the
Oxford Faculty of Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of the English presenta - tions at hand this is the best ; with its intro - duction on the preliminaries of the war , and the text of the document , it makes a useful handbook .

		New Edition .


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		glish translation under the title `` The Truth about
Germany	LOCATION	'' -RRB- was given to Americans leaving
Germany	LOCATION	.

		To counteract its influ - ence Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	has written `` The Real ` Truth about
Germany	LOCATION	' '' which , taking up the German publication paragraph by paragraph , gives the viewpoint of the English in refutation .

		There are certain variations between the German text and that given as the text in the English edition by Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	.

		The latter 's chapter `` Who Is to Be Victo - rious ? ''

		-LRB- in which it is argued that
Germany	LOCATION	will not continue to respect the
Monroe	PERSON	Doc - trine -RRB- does not appear in the original .

		We have no means of explaining this discrepancy and mention it without meaning to reflect on any one .

		But what of it ?

		A book of this kind , consisting as it does of opinions of men with different premises , converts but few . ' '

		The Case of
Belgium	LOCATION	in the Present War , ' ' the work of the Belgian delegates to the
United States	LOCATION	, is an account of the violation of the neutrality of
Belgium	LOCATION	and of the laws of war in Belgian territory by
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It contains diplomatic correspondence and the findings of the Belgian commission in the form of a number of surprising affidavits and statements of witnesses .

		These latter are in a number of cases not so convincing as to be above question .

		Another group of books , less directly con - cerned with the war but still a product of it , has begun to appear .

		`` The Russian Army from Within '' is the work of Mr.
Barnes Steveni	PERSON	, who for twenty-seven years has lived in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Though written in the greatest haste , the book is readable and instructive .

		The peasant , who , according to Mr.
Steveni	PERSON	, is the backbone of the army , is of medium stature , and as a recruit more often than not illiterate , careless , procrastinating , happy - go-lucky , slavish , superstitious ; the finished material is excellent , hardy , stubborn , self-sac - rificing , and ready to die , one of his proverbs being `` Life is a farthing . ''

		He is a child of nature , easily satisfied , but also subject to fits of passion . ' '

		A great fault of the Russian army is its poorly managed Commissariat .

		... So long as the Russian Government persists in the questionable practice of paying its offi - cials and public servants about half the wages due to them this evil will never be eradi - cated . ''

		On the prospects of the war Mr.
Steveni	PERSON	says , `` it is difficult not to believe that
Russia	LOCATION	will emerge victorious ... provided that her officers and generals are on a line with her brave and hardy soldiers , and that the alien races subject to her sway remain loyal . ''

		`` The German Army from Within , '' by `` a British Officer who has served in it '' is a 380 -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	& moderately interesting account of personal experiences .

		It is unsympathetic and far from flattering to the German army .

		Says the anonymous author : `` I speak with knowl - edge of both English and German soldiers privates , non-coms. , and officers of rank and I am firmly convinced that one
British Tommy	PERSON	is the equal of three Germans of the same rank '' ; and , elsewhere , `` The artillery , too , is much given to stale technicalities , cir - cus tricks , and so on , and to adherence to conservative notions of artillery operations . ''

		However , these are merely opinions .

		What value this book has lies in its narrative of army life in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		`` The Secrets of the German War Office '' by the pseudonymous Dr. Graves is without a doubt the most thrilling reading in the list .

		It purports to be the experiences of a German secret agent , and the circumstantial story and the obvious knowledge of the countries visited as well as the specific facts mentioned , make it seem a true narrative .

		Chapters have been printed in magazines , which seem to take the story for what it pretends to be .

		Still , as someone has remarked , the author is either a faker or a traitor .

		Certain it is that the story of the secret agent 's betrayal by his own coun - try and his consequent defection to
England	LOCATION	is a bit thin .

		An acquaintance who claims to have been in the German secret service for some years declares the book to be a fake , though he admits that its author knows some of the practices of the
German Intelligence Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whether the book is history or ro - mance it is fascinating reading and it is no wonder that the first edition was exhausted in two days and the second in two weeks .

		Two books by the oft-mentioned General von Bernhardi are at hand .

		`` How
Germany	LOCATION	Makes War '' is an English condensation of the German original published in
1911	DATE	.

		It is a technical work which discusses the prob - lems of modern warfare and proposes certain changes in the methods now in use in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		General von
Bernhardi	ORGANIZATION	is an ex - cavalry officer with wide experience and knowledge of military history .

		In this work he seeks to discover `` not only the nature of war of today in theory , but also to develop from this cognition a superior principle of action , ... '' '' It seemed to me possible and useful to con - duct war from the outset in accordance with dis - tinct principles recognized a priori , and to master spiritually the powerful forces bound to be let loose in it , instead of leaving them to their innate impulses , in opposition to the Italian general who insists that in a war of the future only the original direction given to the masses can be intended , but that afterwards ' the stream will , so to say , move on automatically . '

		... We Germans shall in the next war ' be obliged to fight against enemies far superior in numbers , and shall therefore need spir - itual superiority to equalize the numerical one . ' ''

		The book which has made General von
Bern	LOCATION	- hardi famous , is ``
Germany	LOCATION	and the Next War , '' first published in
1912	DATE	.

		The vogue of this book in the present crisis , which is the `` next war '' the author had in mind , is indi - cated by the many editions appearing .

		The sudden demand of the reading public for this book may be explained in the words of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	.

		General von
Bernhardi	ORGANIZATION	's doctrines , based on
Treitschke	ORGANIZATION	's , he says , `` would have deserved little notice , much less refutation , but for one deplorable fact , that action has - been taken by the government of a great nation ... which is consonant with them and seems to imply a belief in their sound - ness . ''

		General von
Bernhardi	PERSON	has accord - ingly come to be regarded as the spokesman of the partly imagined and at best undefined Pan-Germanism , made so well-known in English-speaking countries by Mr.
Roland Usher	PERSON	's clever book .

		Two chapters of
Bernhardi	LOCATION	are , at the pres - ent juncture , the most interesting , one on the `` Character of Our Next War , '' the other on `` The Next Naval War . ''

		We shall attempt a resume of these , giving the author 's words where possible .

		``
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	and
Eussia	PERSON	have a com - mon interest in breaking down our power .

		This interest will sooner or later be asserted by arms . ''

		For a continental European war , General von Bernhardi thinks , the British Territorial army may be left out of account as `` its military value can not be ranked very highly . ''

		Germany will have to deal only with the British regular army : '' It is very questionable whether the English army is capable of effectively acting on the offen - sive against
Continental	ORGANIZATION	European troops .

		In
South Africa	LOCATION	the English regiments for the most part fought very bravely and stood great losses ; on the other hand , they completely failed in the offensive , in tactics as in operations , and with few exceptions the generalship was equally deficient .

		The last manoeuvers on a large scale held in
Ireland	LOCATION	, under the direction of General French , did not , ac - cording to available information , show the English army in a favorable light so far as strategical ability went . ''

		The tactical value of the French troops is , of course , very high ; numerically the army of our neighbour on the west is almost equal , and in some directions there may be a superiority in organiza - tion and equipment ; in other directions we have a distinct advantage .

		The French army lacks the subordination under a single commander , the united spirit which characterizes the German army ,
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 381 the tenacious strength of the German race , and the esprit de corps of the officers .


France	LOCATION	, too , has not those national reserves available which would allow us almost to double our forces . ''

		In
Russia	LOCATION	`` hatred of
Germany	LOCATION	is as per - sistent as ever , '' and public opinion would favor a war in the west .

		So far as Russian troops go they fight with great stubbornness .

		But in the Japanese war the `` Russian army quite failed on the offensive , in a certain sense tactically , but essentially owing to inadequacy of the commanders and the failure of the individuals .

		... It can hardly be presumed that the spirit of Russian generalship has completely changed since the defeats in Man - churia ... This army must therefore al - ways be met with a bold policy of attack . ''

		General von
Bernhardi	ORGANIZATION	expects the revolution - ary elements in
Russia	LOCATION	-LRB- and also
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	in the
East	LOCATION	-RRB- to operate as restraining forces against
Russia	LOCATION	in the next European war one of the few instances in which he conspicuously misjudged what has happened .

		General von Bernhardi proceeds to consider what forces
Germany	LOCATION	can count on against
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		He does not regard the Triple Alliance as solid : '' We are not even sure of their diplomatic help , as the conduct of
Italy	LOCATION	at the conference of Alge - ciras sufficiently demonstrated .

		It even seems questionable at the present moment whether we can always reckon on the support of the members of the
Triple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	in a defensive war .

		... If we consider how difficult
Italy	LOCATION	would find it to make her forces fit to cope with
France	LOCATION	, and to protect her coasts against hostile attacks , and if we think how the annexation of
Tripoli	LOCATION	has created a new possession , which is not easily defended against
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, we may fairly doubt whether
Italy	LOCATION	would take part in a war in which
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	were allied against us .

		``
Austria	LOCATION	is undoubtedly a loyal ally ... Nev - ertheless , there is cause for anxiety , because in a conglomerate
State	ORGANIZATION	like
Austria	LOCATION	, which contains numerous Slavonic elements , patriotism may not be strong enough to allow the
Government	ORGANIZATION	to fight to the death with
Russia	LOCATION	, were the latter to defeat us .

		The occurrence of such an event is not im - probable .

		When enumerating the possibilities that might affect our policy , we can not leave this one out of consideration . ''

		We shall therefore some day , perhaps , be faced with the necessity of standing isolated in a great war of the nations , as once Frederick the Great stood , when he was basely deserted by En - gland in the middle of the struggle , and shall have to trust to our own strength and our own resolu - tion for victory . ''

		Such a war for us more than for any other nation must be a war for our political and national existence .

		This must be so , for our oppo - nents can only attain their political aims by almost annihilating us by land and by sea .

		If the victory is only half won , they would have to expect con - tinuous renewals of the contest , which would be contrary to their interests .

		They know that well enough , and therefore avoid the contest , since we shall certainly defend ourselves with the utmost bitterness and obstinacy .

		If , notwithstanding , cir - cumstances make the war inevitable then the inten - tion of our enemies to crush us to the ground , and our own resolve to maintain our position victo - riously , will make it a war of desperation . ''

		We must therefore prepare not only for a short war , but for a protracted campaign .

		We must be armed in order to complete the overthrow of our enemies , should the victory be ours ; and , if worsted , to continue to defend ourselves in the very heart of our country until success at last is won .

		... A nation of 65,000,000 which stakes all her forces on winning herself a position , and on keeping that position , can not be conquered . ''

		General von
Bernhardi	ORGANIZATION	's forecast of the probable campaigns of
Germany	LOCATION	's `` next war '' -LRB- and particularly what he has to say about
Belgium	LOCATION	's place in them -RRB- has contributed more than anything else to give his book its wide notoriety : '' If the war ... be waged against us -LSB- by
France	LOCATION	-RSB- in combination with
England	LOCATION	, it may be assumed that the allied Great Powers would at - tempt to turn our strategical right flank through
Belgium	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	, and penetrate into the heart of
Germany	LOCATION	through the great gap in the fortresses between
Wesel	PERSON	and
Flushing	LOCATION	.

		This operation would have the considerable advantage of avoiding the strong line of the Rhine and threatening our naval bases from the land side . ''

		The main issue for
England	LOCATION	is to annihilate our navy and oversea commerce , in order to pre - vent , from reasons already explained , any further expansion of our power .

		But it is not her interest to destroy our position as a
Continental Power	ORGANIZATION	, or to help
France	LOCATION	to attain the supremacy in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		England 's participation in the land war will show desperate energy `` only so far as it pur - sues the object of conquering our naval ' bases . ' '

		`` Our western frontier , '' General von
Bernhardi	PERSON	continues , `` in itself strong , can be easily turned on the north through
Belgium	LOCATION	and
Holland	LOCATION	.

		No natural obstacle , no strong fortress , is there to oppose a hostile invasion , and neutrality is only a paper bulwark . ''

		In the naval actions of the `` next war '' Ger - many '' will be thrown on her own resources and will have to protect herself singlehanded against supe - rior forces which will certainly press her hard .

		... As regards materiel and training , it may be assumed that our fleet is distinctly superior to the French and Russian , but that
England	LOCATION	is our equal in that respect .

		Our ships ' cannons will probably show a superiority over the English , and our tor - pedo fleet , by its reckless energy , excellent training , and daring spirit of adventure , will make up some 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	of the numerical disadvantage .

		It remains to be seen whether these advantages will have much weight against the overwhelming superiority of an experienced and celebrated fleet like the English . ''

		English commerce must be attacked : '' The prizes which fall into our hands must be remorselessly destroyed since it will usually be im - possible , owing to the great English superiority and the few bases we have abroad , to bring them back in safety without exposing our vessels to great risks .

		The sharpest measures must be taken against neutral ships laden with contraband .

		Nev - ertheless , no very valuable results can be expected from a war aganst
England	LOCATION	's trade . ''

		Under these circumstances , nothing would be left for us but to retire with our war-fleet under the guns of the coast fortifications , and by the use of mines to protect our own shores and make them dangerous to English vessels . '' ''

		It would be necessary to take further steps to secure the importation from abroad of supplies necessary to us , since our own communications will be completely cut off by the English .

		The simplest and cheapest way would be if we obtained for - eign goods through
Holland	LOCATION	or perhaps neutral
Belgium	LOCATION	... '' General
von Bernhardi	PERSON	is certain that Ger - many `` must lose no time in preparing a road on which we can import the most essential foodstuffs and raw materials , and also export , if only in small quantities , the surplus of our industrial products . ''

		But without the aid of land forces to attack German naval bases from the rear , the allies , in his opinion , `` could not obtain a decisive result . ''

		The prospect of any successful issue for
Germany	LOCATION	in naval warfare against the combined French and English fleet `` shrinks into the background '' : '' But we need not even then despair .

		On the contrary , we must fight the French fleet , so to speak , on land i. e. , we must defeat
France	LOCATION	so decisively that she would be compelled to renounce her alliance with
England	LOCATION	and withdraw her fleet to save herself from total destruction .

		Just as in 1870-71 we marched to the shores of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, so this time again we must resolve on an absolute conquest , in order to capture the French naval ports and destroy the French naval depots .

		It would be a war to the knife with
France	LOCATION	, one which would , if victorious , annihilate once for all the French position as a Great Power .

		If
France	LOCATION	, with her falling birth-rate , determines on such a war , it is at the risk of losing her place in the first rank of European nations , and sinking into per - manent political subservience .

		Those are the stakes . ''

		A valuable commentary on
General von Bernhardi	ORGANIZATION	's book is ``
Germany	LOCATION	and En - gland , '' by the late Professor
Cramb	PERSON	, of Queen 's
College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		This book , which was reviewed in THE DIAL of
October 16	DATE	, is an attempt to interpret to Englishmen what
Cramb	PERSON	considered the newer spirit of Ger - many .

		As exponents of this German spirit he uses General
von Bernhardi	PERSON	and men of his school , such as Ttreitschke and Delbriick .

		If General von Berhardi really represents a con - siderable influence in German thinking , and what
Cramb	PERSON	wrote had any real influence in
England	LOCATION	, there is no wonder that the two nations are at war ; for neither book poured oil on troubled waters .

		BLAKELOCK .

		* Not many know the work of
Blakelock	PERSON	, even of those interested in American landscape , and of those few I should hardly claim to be one .


Blakelock	PERSON	's pictures are chiefly in pri - vate collections and are but rarely to be found in the great galleries .

		There are two -LRB- not very characteristic , as I remember -RRB- in the Metropolitan Museum , but I do not recall any in the galleries of
Boston	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, or
Chicago	LOCATION	, or in the
Corcoran Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		Slight note of him will be found in the histories of art .

		He is commonly mentioned , in passing , among the `` recent painters , '' but with little account of his art .

		It will be a surprise to some who know of him to know that he is still living , though of clouded mind .

		He will not be found in `` Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Yet there are pictures of his that once seen make a very lasting impression .

		In the gal - lery of the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	are , or used to be , two , of which the sentiment has lingered long in my mind , even though the forms and subjects have vanished , a sentiment that seems indeed independent of the forms of nature which the painter has rendered .

		A discrim - inating critic has called
Blakelock	PERSON	`` that superb spiritualist of the woods , '' a phrase that points to something of the same sort .

		Of one of the Blakelocks of the Evans collection , exhibited some time ago at the
Lotos Club	ORGANIZATION	, I read , `` Nothing could be more romantic than this .

		A night sky , green with the moon 's radiance ; clouds that are tinted like smoke ; a great high moon , its edges melting into a luminous haze a world simple yet indescrib - able , grand , and infinitely appealing . ' '

		There is a particular quality in work which calls forth such expressions , something that the lover of art or nature may well desire to know .

		Other American landscape painters do not impress us in such a way .

		Not many of them would be thought of as romantic in any such a sense .

		If they are romantic it is with the romance of
Thomas Cole	PERSON	or
Frederick E. Church	PERSON	, now reviving in the ideals of later *
RALPH ALBERT BLAKELOCK	PERSON	.

Elliott Daingerfield	ORGANIZATION	.

New York	LOCATION	:
Frederic Fairchild Sherman	PERSON	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 383 men , the romance of mountain-height and -RSB- river-gorge , of torrent and precipice .

		Later landscape painters , with their feeling for the beauty of everyday nature and the exhilara - tion of sunlight , are not apt to be romantic .

		This is something different .

		With a view of appreciating such a quality , or at least of finding some definition of it , one may turn to Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	's recent monograph .

		The book is one of the series which includes also the studies of
George Inness	PERSON	and of
Homer Martin	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	and Mr.
Mather	PERSON	.


Blakelock	PERSON	is hardly a painter of such note as either of these : we rather regret that if a study is to be published , a beautiful book to be produced , it should not be of one of the greater men .

		We ` wish some one would write adequately of
Cole	ORGANIZATION	or
Durant	PERSON	, to tell us , at least , what they were in their own day and generation , if not still .

		But one may be thankful for whatever one can get in a field where special studies are so uncommon .

		On beginning Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	's book one would perhaps get the idea that
Blakelock	PERSON	had something particular to say , that his effort was to render some definite report of what he had learned from nature , that in his heart was some profound belief that he would share with us .

		* But such a notion would be mistaken , and indeed if one looked in Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	's book for any definite belief or idea of
Blakelock	ORGANIZATION	's , one would be disappointed .

		Whatever report
Blakelock	PERSON	would have rendered of nature , whatever he had to say as a result of his study of her , was something to be rendered or said in painter 's medium only , something not to be put in definite form of words .

		This it is , perhaps , that leads one to say that there is something spiritual in his work , something independent not only of the material form , but of the intellectual idea as well .

		As to what this strange something is , Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	gives us no very satisfactory ac - count , and that in part for the reason just given , that such things can not be put into words .

		Just in so far as they are the painter 's report they can be rendered by the painter only .

		Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	has two means at hand : < he can offer description , and so he does , and he can offer illustrations .

		But neither means is adequate ; for photograph can not give color , which in
Blakelock	ORGANIZATION	is a necessary thing , and words tend to intellectualize .

		We do not en - tirely get the magic quality in the reproduc - tion of Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	's `` Moonlight , '' nor in this description : '' Its beauty depends quite entirely upon the sky , there is little else .

		Slight trees above the earth !

		* See p. 10 , where Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	uses expressions of this sort .

		line , a very low horizon or sky-line , and the mys - terious glint of water somewhere out there among the shadows , but the great sky soars up from hori - zon to zenith , arching overhead superbly , and baffling all search in its gradations ; the moon hangs low and fills the air with light , a faint haze surrounds it , almost a halo , and the light is that mysterious mingling of opaline colors merging into pale greens and blues , splendidly assembled , and performing their work of gradation quite per - fectly . ''

		Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	has no idea that he is attaining the impossible in this description .

		He comments on his own work : `` Authors and critics have an easy way of writing things about pictures which mean little , rhapso - dising sometimes and condemning at others , and always building up meanings for the reader 's pleasure .

		Is n't it enough , perhaps , to say that a man 's vision has been handed on to us by processes of perfect craft so that we are aware , completely so , of its beauty and haunting charm ? ''

		What , then , is to be said in a book on
Blake	PERSON	- lock ?

		It may be useful to some to have the facts of his life and his place in the develop - ment of the landscape art of our country .

		Others would like a list , even tentative , of his pictures and some definite idea as to where they may be found , so that they may get from the pictures themselves the pleasure they can never get from an account of them .

		Mr.
Dain	PERSON	- gerfield does not concern himself with these matters , although he has a few anecdotes of the painter and with each illustration men - tions the place where the picture hangs .

		Fur - ther , one might want to know something of
Blakelock	ORGANIZATION	's technique , and on this matter Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	has a good deal of information .

		But these things are slight compared with what we really wish to know about the painter .

		On this subject I believe the following will be of use :
Blakelock	PERSON	cared comparatively little for form , either in his composition or in his rendering of particular objects .

		He was absorbed in other things .

		And this is some - thing that many people will like to appre - ciate .

		There is something in nature besides form , something that in many minds is infi - nitely superior to form .

		Many think that if you paint a tree people ought to know what kind of tree it is , whether oak or hop horn - beam or mulberry .


Blakelock	PERSON	had no such idea : he would have distinguished probably between the elm and the banyan tree , but not by the shape of their leaves .

		He saw other things in nature , and one good thing about an appreciation of him is that it shows that there are other things than form to see .

		Of these other things color is one , and
Blakelock	PERSON	certainly loved color , though Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	does not think him a great color - 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16 1st	DATE	.

		Harmony of color or of value , then , may be looked for in nature or in
Blakelock	PERSON	's ren - dering of her .

		But though harmony of color or of value is a beautiful factor in his work , yet it is never the one particular thing which he saw in nature , the particular matter of which he wished to make report , that seemed always to make the main impression on him .

		It is then a sentiment or an emotion that
Blakelock	PERSON	conveys , rather than beauty of form or harmony of color , rather than idea or story .

		But his sentiment or emotion does not appear to be one of the common sentiments or emo - tions .

		It is not that he makes us melancholy or cheerful ; it is something different , some - thing elusive , something that we call romantic .

		This , whatever it be , is the interesting thing about
Blakelock	PERSON	.

		The earlier American land - scape artists were generally bent on rendering the more grandiose forms of nature , and the emotion which one may find in their works was the emotion of one who leaves a humdrum civ - ilization to commune with the spirit of some other world more attuned than ours to the higher aspirations of the soul .

		They gave us in picture what
Byron	PERSON	gave in poetry .

		The later landscape painters from Inness down , have tried to reveal to us an other-world in the familiar lines and harmonies of the field and wood and meadow of every day .

		They are more like ``
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Blakelock does neither .

		His world is suggested by reality but it is his own .

		It is a painter 's world and to come to it you must come by the painter 's way .

		`` We have here in painting one of the char - acteristics of much of the romance of the later nineteenth century , an inheritance of the extravagant individualisms of earlier years .


Blake	PERSON	, long ago , the Rossettis ,
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, Swin - burne ,
Yeats	PERSON	, are poets who seek an other - world of poetic beauty , a world of their own , having but slight connection with the actual circumstance we know .

		Practical America cares little for these things , which is one rea - son for the older neglect of
Blakelock	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a good sign that he becomes more widely known .

		tion with this event that
Victor Hugo	PERSON	first saw her ; and in no long time Mile Drouet had renounced her millionaire and her career to become the mistress , the life-long friend , the most worshipful adorer , of the great poet .

		Hugo was already married , and his friends were amazed , as Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	says in his ex - cellent life of Hugo , to find the model husband and father , the poet whose verses proclaimed the sacredness of hearth and home , running like any common mortal after an actress .

		`` It is very seldom , '' writes one of them , `` that one can find Hugo at home now ; he goes there only at meal time .

		Poor Madame Hugo ! ' '

		The circumstance of a man 's leaving his wife to run after an actress presents nothing that is novel , and but little that is interesting .

		Yet Hugo 's state of mind on this occasion , so far from commonplace was it , is perhaps worth remarking .

		He did not adopt the cynical tone of a man of the world , nor can it be discov - ered that he ever experienced any feeling of remorse .

		To one of his friends , who uttered some protest or other , he replied : '' No one understands me , not even you ,
Pavie	ORGANIZATION	.

		... I have never committed more faults than this year , and I have never been a better man far better now than in my time of innocence which you regret .

		Yes , formerly I was innocent ; now I am indulgent .

		That is a great gain , God knows .

		I have beside me a dear friend , -LSB- his wife , he means -RSB- an angel whom you venerate as much as I do , who pardons me and loves me still .

		To love and to forgive that is not of Man , it is of God or of Woman . ''

		To one who is familiar with Hugo , even this is not novel ; but it must be allowed to be rather interesting .

		We do not recall that
Rousseau	PERSON	, who was very good at this sort of intellectual prestidigitation , ever proved himself a better master of the art .

		And perhaps Hugo never revealed himself more perfectly , or ever better exposed the peculiar quality of the romantic mind , than in just this phrase : `` I have never committed more faults than this year , and 1 have never ` been a better man . ''

		Hugo was of those who value experience rather by its intensity than its quality .

		Experience , if only it be of a penetrating sort , adds to the sum of emotional expression in the world , a quite sufficient justification .

		Now , to betray your wife and to be forgiven is such an expe - rience all the more so in case your purpose is to go on betraying her and to be still for - given : an experience which stimulates the sensibilities and , by multiplying these poig - nant memories that touch the source of tears , proves the presence of the good heart .

		Re - morse !

		There could be no question of re - morse , still less of cynicism .

		Hugo could only
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 385 be thankful for faults which were the out - ward expression of an inward grace ; they but intensified in him , as it were , that elan vital which is the measure of virtue .

		Poor Madame Hugo !

		Yes , but poor Mile Drouet also .

		Her connection with Hugo lasted fifty years until the lady 's death in
1883	DATE	.

		After she left the excitement of the theatre for the somewhat cloistered existence which Hugo provided for her , time hung heavy on her hands , and she complained of it . ' '

		Write to me , ' ' said Hugo . ' '

		Write me everything that comes into your head , every - thing that causes your heart to beat . ''

		And so she did .

		Day after day , for fifty years , she produced these notes , left in the room to be picked up by her lover , `` scribbles , '' as she called them , twenty thousand of them still preserved , from which
M. Gimbaud	ORGANIZATION	has selected a few as worthy to be printed .

		As letters , it can hardly be said they were worth printing at all .

		Their value is in displaying the behavior of Hugo 's really sublime egoism in a relation the most intimate in the world , in revealing the effect of it , day by day and year by year , upon the woman who was bound to him as with wain ropes by an overmaster - ing and singularly enduring attachment .

		It is well known that few people found it possible to associate on terms of equality with Hugo .

		If he had possessed a sense of humor he might have defined his friends as those who were willing to take him at his own valuation .

		And Mile Drouet 's taking him so sincerely and so unreservedly at his own valuation was doubtless one secret of her per - sistent hold upon him .

		But even Hugo must soon have grown weary of a woman who could flatter him in no more delicate way than by repeatedly calling him the greatest man in the world ; and in fact there was , in his rela - tion with
Mile Drouet	PERSON	, or in their manner of regarding it , something which ministered to his vanity in a way quite out of the ordinary .

		Their relation , from the beginning , they transformed , in true romantic fashion , into something other than it was , into a religious rite if you please , a sacrifice or atonement that was to work a kind of redemption of the lady 's unregenerate nature .

		Such , at least , was her own understanding of the matter .

		`` I see you as you are , '' she writes , `` that is to say , a God-made man to redeem and rescue me from the infamous life to which I had so long been enslaved . ''

		This is an idea to which we can imagine Hugo assenting without re - luctance , and without a smile .

		The role was one for which he was well fitted ; and it had this singular advantage , that it enabled him to say at any time , and with a clear con - science : `` I have never committed more faults than this year , and I have never been a better man . ''

		Surely , the redemption of one poor woman provided a treasury of good works upon which one could safely draw for indulgence to persist in very human faults .

		It would be interesting to follow in some detail the fortunes of this idealized concep - tion of their affair , to disengage , as it were , from the commonplace events of their lives the process of redemption .

		In the early years , the prospect of achieving an object so intangi - ble seemed slight enough .

		For Mile Drouet was no docile penitent .

		She was often in passionate revolt , protesting against Hugo 's insane jealousy , complaining bitterly of his self-absorption , resenting his brutal remind - ers of her fallen days , mad with jealous rage at his betrayals .

		She threatens to leave him , often thinks on suicide , or darkly hints at dire misfortunes coming to pass when he is least prepared .

		But the impulse to action seems always spent in the frenzy of disclos - ing the reasons for it ; and we can well imag - ine the exhausted lady , whenever her lover crosses her threshold again , gladly sinking into his reconciling embrace .

		Her state of mind during these early years she has herself not inaptly portrayed in a graphic sentence .

		Having distinguished , apropos of nothing in particular , her varied ways of loving her ' ' great little man , ' ' she says : ' ' That is why , my glorious Victor , at one and the same mo - ment I can rage , weep , crawl or stand erect : I bow my head and venerate you ! ' '

		Rage , weep , crawl , or stand erect as she might , Mile Drouet always ended by bowing her head in veneration .

		That is the main point : the idea that Hugo was the God-made man to redeem and rescue her never lost its power ; and curiously enough this ideal , pre - posterous in itself no doubt , was in a manner realized ; a kind of spiritual regeneration did in fact come to pass , such is the strange power of ideals , even the miost unpromising .

		The poor lady learned the meaning of
Faust	ORGANIZATION	's `` Entbehren sollst du , sollst entbehren ! ''

		And we may contrast with the sentence just quoted words which she set down one eve - ning in
1853	DATE	, during the exile on the island of
Jersey	LOCATION	, as an evidence of the transforma - tion that had been effected : '' I come to tell you that I love you without regret for the past or fear for the future .

		I come with a smile on my lips and a blessing in my bosom , with my hand upon my mutilated heart and my eyes full of pardon , with my purity re - stored and my soul redeemed by twenty years of fidelity and love , with my delusions swept away and my faith shining .

		... I constitute you the supreme arbiter of my fate .

		Do with me what 386 -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	you will in this life so long as you take me with you in the next .

		I sacrifice my feelings to the virtue of your wife and the innocence of your daughter , as a homage and as a safeguard , and I reserve my prayers and tears for poor fallen women like myself . ''

		For restoring the purity of fallen women , there are more conventional ways , and bet - ter ones , doubtless , than that of bestowing twenty years of fidelity and love upon another woman 's husband ; nevertheless , in
Mile Drouet	LOCATION	's case , a life of devotion and service , winning at last the recognition of Hugo 's family and the respect of his friends , did in - vest the declining days of the white-haired lady with a certain nobility at least , if not perhaps with that `` majestic dignity '' which
Jules Claretie	PERSON	attributed to her at the time of her death .

		CARL BECKER .

		MR.
HAVELOCK ELLIS	PERSON	OBSERVES .

		* `` Follow your author , '' said a conserva - tive French editor to a neophyte , `` and you will probably write a useful review . ''

		But how is one to follow a man of so versatile a talent as that of Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	when he flits so rapidly from topic to topic that he gives us six score essay ettes -LRB- if the editor will concede the word to our sore need -RRB- in the 257 pages of `` Impressions and Comments '' ?

		Of course the reading of these independent themes will present no problem ; for one sim - ply puts the hamper of good things on the table at the head of his bed , or beside his
Morris	PERSON	chair , and reaches out for a bite or a sup , so to speak , whenever he feels inclined .

		But reviewing the volume is another matter .

		One can not even describe these compositions technically .

		The author modestly speaks of them as `` random leaves , '' and puts them forth as unpretentious jottings in an irregu - lar diary covering a period of eighteen months .

		They are not exactly pensees , al - though one often thinks of
Joubert	PERSON	.

		They could hardly be defined as essays , although one is frequently reminded of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
Haz	PERSON	- litt and Montaigne and other beloved masters of that literary form .

		Occasionally there is an almost disturbing intimacy of self - revela - tion that suggests the inimitable
Pepys	PERSON	.

		And once or twice we even catch a note that recalls the arch-cynic of French literature .

		-LRB- `` A sublime faith in Human Imbecility has sel - dom led those who cherish it astray . '' -RRB-

		As to the range and diversity of the subjects treated we may introduce the following suc - cessions to be found under three letters of the * IMPRESSIONS AND COMMENTS .

		By
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	.

		Bos - ton :
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		index :
Browning	PERSON	,
Bryan	PERSON	,
Buddha	ORGANIZATION	, and Bur - gundy ; Ogive , Olives , and
Ovid	LOCATION	; Vegetarian - ism ,
Velasquez	PERSON	, and
Verlaine	PERSON	.

		From the foregoing it will be clear that the worth of these writings will depend on the personality of the author ; and it is equally clear that the reviewer thinks they are valu - able , or he would not be burdening his readers with all this comment .

		The work of Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	has been most varied .

		He has been a teacher in
Australia	LOCATION	, a medical student and practitioner in
England	LOCATION	, a literary critic , an editor of plays , a thoughtful and fruitful scientist , a zealous social reformer , and inci - dentally a lover of painting , music , sculpture , and travel .

		His publications are so well known that we need not enumerate them , although their range of diversity is not al - ways realized .

		For instance , many readers have enjoyed `` The Soul of
Spain	LOCATION	'' without knowing that its author has also written sev - eral substantial volumes on the psychology of sex and kindred subjects .

		Now , when a man of these varied talents and interests , having reached the age of fifty-three , decides to give the world a book of the type we failed to de - scribe * in our first paragraph , the reading public is justified in expecting a production that shall be a source of pleasure and profit ; and one reviewer at least has not been dis - appointed .

		Naturally , as we turn the pages , we are constantly lighting upon the Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	of his more formal writings ; but the beauty of the present volume is that if one does not like the Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	he encounters at any particular point , he is sure to be charmed with an alto - gether different Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	just round the corner .

		However , we may probably serve our readers better by adducing a few examples of our author 's impressions and comments than by dwelling upon our own feelings in the matter .

		Under the date of
February 10	DATE	, then , we find him writing on the apparently trivial topic of a French soprano singing for the first time on an English platform .

		He notes her elegant and harmonious Parisian costume , her finely trained voice , her dramatic but re - strained presentation , and her winning , gra - cious deportment .

		You will say this is all very ordinary .

		Probably it is ; but it is con - tinued in this strain : '' She is a complete success with her audience .

		Yet she is really , one divines , a fairly common - place person .

		And she is not beautiful .

		And even her voice has no marvellous original quality .

		She has on her side a certain qiiality of nervous texture to mould artistically , but that is not a personal possession but merely a quality of her race .

		She
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 387 has laboriously wrought this ductile nervous tissue to her own ends .

		By force of long training , dis - cipline , art , she has made herself what she desired to be .

		She has become all that she had in her to be .

		She has given to the world all that the world has any right to ask of her . ''

		That is all .

		But this training and this dis - cipline , the ability to be oneself and to impart graciously to others the utmost that they have any right to demand is not that the whole Art of Living and the entire Code of Morality ? ''

		Or if we turn to the engrossing theme of war , we find neither the now familiar economic protest of ``
Norman Angell	PERSON	'' nor the old sentimental plea against suffering and sacri - fice of human life .

		Indeed , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	insists that it is man 's feeble shrinking from death , with his flabby horror of pain , that marks the final stage of decay in any civilization .

		But he execrates war none the less for his own reasons .

		`` Apart from the intolerable burden of arma - ments it imposes , and the flagrant disregard of justice it involves , the crushing objection to war , from the standpoint of Humanity and Society , is not that it distributes Pain and inflicts Death , but that it distributes and inflicts them on an absurdly wholesale scale and on the wrong people .

		So that it is awry to all the ends of reasonable civilization .

		Occasionally , no doubt , it may kill off the people who ought to be killed , but that is only by accident , for by its very organization it is more likely to kill the people who ought not to be killed .

		Occasionally and incidentally , also , it may promote Heroism , but its heroes merely exterminate each other for the benefit of people who are not heroes . ''

		In contrast to the foregoing we may intro - duce three passages treating of the nude .

		On
October 4	DATE	, as Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	was lying with a book on the rocks by the seashore , he saw in the far distance a dim feminine figure walk down the beach and plunge into the waves .

		The inci - dent results in this reflection : '' In an age when savagery has passed and civili - zation has not arrived , it is only by stealth , at rare moments , that the human form may emerge from the prison house of its garments , it is only from afar that the radiance of its beauty if beauty is still left to it may faintly flash before us .

		`` Among pseudo-Christian barbarians , as
Heine	PERSON	described them , the Olympian deities still wander homelessly , scarce emerging from beneath obscure disguises , and half ashamed of their own divinity . ''

		In a similar spirit he describes the dancing of
Bianca Stella	PERSON	: `` As she danced , when I noted the spectators , I could see here and there a gleam in the eyes of coarse faces , though there was no slightest move - ment or gesture or look of the dancer to evoke it .

		For these men
Bianca Stella	PERSON	had danced in vain , for it remains symbolically true only the pure in heart can see God .

		To see
Bianca Stella	PERSON	truly was to realize that it is not desire but a sacred awe which nakedness inspires , an intoxication of the spirit rather than of the senses , no flame of lust but rather a purifying and exalting fire .

		To feel otherwise has merely been the unhappy priv - ilege of men intoxicated by the stifling and un - wholesome air of modern artificiality . ''

		Less convincing but equally illustrative of our volume is the passage about a young Ger - man danseuse who has been arrested by the Parisian police on a charge of outrage aux mceurs for appearing naked on the stage .

		To a journalist the lady expresses her indigna - tion at this insult to her art : '' ' Let there be no mistake ; when I remove my chemise to come on the stage it is in order to bare my soul . '

		Not quite a wise thing to say to a journalist , but it is in effect what the suffragette also says , and is rewarded with rotten tomatoes as her sister with a proces-verbal . ''

		It is hard to resist the temptation to take up other topics , particularly music , flowers , literature , travel , and progress ; but we may not trespass further on the kindness of our readers .

		We have spoken of the volume lightly as a hamper , and we may continue the figure by saying that inevitably different palates will be differently affected .

		All who partake may find toothsome and wholesome morsels ; but many will make a wry face at certain mouth - fuls and call for more orthodox fare .

		As for your reviewer , it need hardly be said that he finds a pleasant flavor on his gustatory nerves , as of something agreeable , helpful , and stimu - lating , albeit occasionally acrid and disturb - ing .

		His hand will return many times to the hamper .

		Aisr INTIMATE VIEW OF
TOLSTOI	LOCATION	.

		* It is with a painful sense of the futility seemingly inherent in even the best endeavors after human good that one reads by the lurid glare of the European holocaust an intimate revelation of the great spirit of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, de - voted through so many years to the advocacy of Christian conduct between men and na - tions , and so loyal to peace and brotherhood .

		Are the Tolstois and the Ruskins of the race mere players in a comedy staged by ironic gods , and does each lapse into silence only to leave the stage free for another vain and futile performer to play his fruitless role ?

		Surely
Tolstoi	PERSON	would have died of a broken heart had he lived till the middle of the year
1914	DATE	.

		We must needs reassure ourselves by reflecting that the outward and obvious event of the day does not always betoken the inward * REMINISCENCES OP TOLSTOY .

Ilya Tol	PERSON	- stoy .

		388 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	spirit of the times .

		The influence of such persons as
Tolstoi	LOCATION	is pervasive and permeat - ing , and we can not cry aloud of this influ - ence , any more than of the
Kingdom of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, `` Lo , here ! ''

		or , `` Lo , there ! ''

		for the influence is within us .

		The world 's hor - ror at its own hideous blunder in this war is a measure of the coming of that influence , and we may still hope for the victory of reason and religion after this frenzy shall have spent itself .

		For the time being , however ,
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's words have a sad realization : '' ... the chief thing I have been trying so hard to say all my life , the thing I believe in , the most im - portant of all , they will forget . ''

		But let us forget instead , for the moment , the gruesome details of the daily slaughter of our fellowmen , and seek a more intimate compre - hension of the spirit of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, so remote , but so fixed , like a star over the battlefield .

		The reminiscences , by his son , Count
Ilya Tolstoi	PERSON	, will help us to such a comprehension .

		It will require a composite of many views to make a true portrait of so great a personality as Tol - stoi , and this must be done by another gen - eration .

		With the lapse of time what was the outgrowth of very temporary Russian condi - tions will be permitted to fall away , what was excessive zeal to balance a keen consciousness of excessive youthful follies will be allowed for , and the character of the great Eussian will become world property like the character of Goethe .

		We may well be grateful for all added material for such a judgment , and especially for material so fresh and authentic as is furnished by the son .

		It is natural that the portion of the memoirs dealing with the childhood of the writer should be the most valuable .

		No other biog - rapher could give us so intimate a view of the home life of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	in his middle years .

		The son , writing with keen satisfaction of his early memories , has succeeded in becoming a child again , and the figure of the father in his pages is commanding and fascinating : '' He hardly ever punished us , but when he looked me in the eyes , he knew everything that I thought , and I was frightened ... He knew all our secrets , too .

		When we played at houses un - der the lilac-bushes , we had three great secrets , which nobody knew but
Seryosha	LOCATION	,
Tanya	PERSON	, and me .

		All of a sudden up came papa one day , and said that he knew all our three secrets and they all began with a B , which was perfectly true . '' ''

		My father always responded to her -LSB- his sister-in-law 's -RSB- outbursts of plain speaking , pro- voked by little household unpleasantnesses , with jovial good humor and playfulness , and would at last bring her round , so that she would first give a rather sulky smile and then melt altogether and join in his laugh . ''

		It is not remarkable , but very pleasant , to read of the great author 's keeping the chil - dren in good humor in rainy weather by play - ing with them `` Numidian cavalry , '' a game of his own invention , of his snatching
Ilya	PERSON	's plate before he could eat his last pancake -LRB- but later restoring it -RRB- , of his teasing the Countess by using the jelly served at dinner to paste together boxes for the youngsters , of his drinking by purposeful mistake the glass of kvass just poured for his neighbor at table , and then profusely apologizing .

		Some of the scenes are not thus agreeable .

		The enthusiastic teacher who later organized schools for the peasants always began his son 's mathematics lesson with pleasantries , but lost his temper during the course of the hour .

		The great writer wrote a miserable scrawl , and then corrected and scratched and interlined till no human eyes could read the copy .

		If the Countess , after superhuman loy - alty and patience in her labor as a copyist , resorted to him for the reading of such a pas - sage , he usually began by evidencing impa - tience at her dullness and concluded by recom - posing what could not be deciphered !

		On the whole , nevertheless , one comes to feel that even before his religious awakening ,
Tolstoi	PERSON	was probably more pleasant than most geniuses .

		After an outburst of impatience with a friend , he would frankly and affec - tionately apologize .

		When he had quarreled with
Tourguenieff	PERSON	, and the latter , after a long absence , visited
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	,
Tolstoi	PERSON	was minutely painstaking to avoid offensive discussion .

		When Tourguenieff shot a wood - cock at dusk and
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's dog failed to re - trieve the game , the children were secretly instructed to run out early in the morning and look for the bird in order to give a pleas - ant close to the incident .

		One gets a satisfac - tory clue to some of the current stories of ruptures with friends in such evidence of high temper and tender-heartedness .

		Extremely valuable material is contained in this volume for those interested primarily in
Tolstoi	LOCATION	's religious and economic opinions , and the genesis and development of these opinions becomes very natural as we observe the actual process .

		However extreme certain of his views may be reckoned by the deliberate ver - dict of posterity , however thwarted in the struggle for free development by the highly artificial environment of aristocratic life in
Tolstoi	LOCATION	's
Russia	LOCATION	, their spontaneousness and naturalness in the midst of such conditions can not be questioned .

		When we see
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	going out to mow the hay of some widow or with tools to thatch the hut of a helpless vil - lager , such acts do not bear the stamp of
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 389 quixotism , but appear rather the natural ex - pression of a profoundly earnest man reacting upon an unhappy environment .

		If that en - vironment was mistaken by
Tolstoi	PERSON	for the universal condition of human society , and his teaching thus took on a tone of sombreness and became at times particularistic , these qualities were only the inevitable result of an intense desire to be genuine and actual rather than vague and theoretical .

		Certainly there is something painful in considering the long struggle after light , and the minute conscien - tiousness in following this light when one con - trasts these stages of
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's life with the exuberance of spirit evidenced by the younger man in the circle of his family when he sang to his children such classic verses as the fol - lowing : Die angenehme Winterzeit Is ferry nice indeet !

		Beiweilen wird 's ein wenig kalt ,
Doch Himmel	PERSON	, stamp your feet !

		Auch wenn Man doch nach
Hause	PERSON	kommt , Da steht der Punch bereit : 1st es nicht ferry nice indeet In der kalten Winterzeit ?

		But whatever lack of balance , sanity , and serenity one may feel in the later
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	is to be attributed to Russian conditions and not to the nature of the man himself .

		Ruskin , we must recall , became actually unbalanced .

		In searching for the inner essence of the personality of
Tolstoi	LOCATION	, the account given in these reminiscences of the relationship of the father toward his son , the author , and the latter 's fiancee before and after their mar - riage is of the greatest value .

		One is tempted to quote from the remarkable letter in which he sets forth the purpose of marriage , but a brief excerpt would fail to represent this touching and profound counsel of a great believer in the things of the spirit to a young man about to enter upon that relationship which so searchingly tests the quality of the spirit .

		How far away we feel , as we read this letter from the camp of the Russian army !

		And how far away seems that future when humanity shall have mastered the brute in - heritance with which it has struggled these thousands of years , and
Tolstois	ORGANIZATION	will reach their spiritual birth without the terrible travail through which this one came : when God shall have returned to himself .

Europe	LOCATION	.

		A CRITIC OF DEMOCRACY .

		* `` As for the American republic , it is a constitu - tional monarchy and nothing else .

		With his large powers in foreign relations , and in domestic affairs with his ministers who are not responsible to con - gress , with his right , which he uses , of initiating legislation , with his right , which he also uses , of appointing all the functionaries of the state , the president of the American republic is a sovereign .

		He is one so much the more in that if his min - isters are not responsible to congress , neither is he , since he was chosen not by congress but by the people .

		At bottom and in all reality the presi - dent of the American republic is a very powerful constitutional monarch , who need consider nothing but the public interest and need take pains about nothing but public opinion to be popular , to be reflected , and where he has been once reflected and can not be again , to be honored in his country .

		He is a sovereign pro tempore , but a sovereign .

		An ambassador from
France	LOCATION	to the
United States	ORGANIZATION	said to me , ' The president of the American republic is incomparably more a king than the king of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and more an emperor than the emperor of
Germany	LOCATION	. '

		There has never been and there is not in the world to-day a pure democracy , unless it be the French democracy . ''

		This passage indicates the degree of interest for readers this side of the sea contained in
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	's criticisms of the French democracy . ''

		The Dread of Responsibility , '' like `` The Cult of Incompetence , '' which appeared several years ago , is a genially and elegantly written -LRB- and elegantly translated -RRB- arraignment of the French commonwealth for its impersonality , its irresponsibility , and its incompetence .

		In the first chapter , which deals with legal ideas and customs , the courts are charged with being controlled by the government in all cases in which the latter is interested , and consequently with being irresponsible .

		The present is unfavorably contrasted with the old regime , where the office of judge was pur - chased , as are still the offices of solicitor and notary .

		A return to this , however , is not advocated .

		M. Faguet would abolish the jury , and give the Court of Cassation power to appoint all judges , and lodge in the bench the power of electing the Court .

		In the second , `` The Professions , '' he discusses the French - man 's fondness for easy , even though not very remunerative , employment under the government , with the irresponsibility it brings .

		All occupations , even those called liberal , are rapidly becoming nationalized in the passion for officialdom .

		In the third chap - ter , `` In the Family , '' the author declares that the dread of responsibility is again mani - fest in the diminution of the birth rate among * THE DREAD OF RESPONSIBILITY .

Nov. 16	DATE	the French .

		This , with the increase of Ger - mans , Italians , and Jews , is causing the enfeeblement of patriotism .

		In the fourth , `` In Political Customs , '' he again contrasts the present regime with the old , and says , '' We have so constitutionally limited the respon - sibility of power as to make it practically nil ... A real constitution has replaced the legal consti - tution , and so completely that no one would dare to violate the real constitution in order to apply the legal , and that to act constitutionally would appear shamelessly unconstitutional .

		And this real constitution is contained in one word : the president of the French republic is a cipher .

		Or in another word , there is no president of the French republic .

		This is so true that a statesman who is elected president of the republic feels sim - ply that his political career is ended . ''

		M. Faguet 's solution is not a return to monarchy , because
France	LOCATION	has really been a republic for eighty years now , and `` it is essentially traditionalist to be a republican . ''

		`` It is a question of making a republic that will work , and that , like all republics that have lived , will be a republic with a demo - cratic base and containing an aristocratic ele - ment . ''

		There always exists an aristocratic element : the judiciary , for example , or the body of barristers , or the body of army offi - cers . ' '

		The aristocratic element in a nation is all that part which has enough of vitality and of cohesive force and of sense of responsibility to form a group , an association , an assemblage of parts , an organism , to become a living thing , that is to say , a collective person . ' '

		The problem is to make it responsible and opera - tive .

		M. Faguet hardly expects to see the desired change , or at least not until democracy in
France	LOCATION	shall have run its course .

		He declares his agreement with Professor
Barrett Wen	PERSON	- dell : ' ' The nature of the Frenchman is to be radical , to be ideologistic , to pursue his ideas to the very end , to have no fear but quite the contrary in considering whither his ideas will lead him . ' '

		He concludes with an exhortation , `` For Each One of Us , '' to bring the French character to the same high level with the French mind .

		`` The French mind is of the first order . ''

		The deficiency in character is * ' the cause of all the trouble . ' '

		NOTES ON NEW NOVELS .

		Mr.
Charles McEvoy	PERSON	's '' Private Affairs '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- is an agreeable surprise .

		It begins with a simple naturalism to tell the story of mid - dle-class folk , a single family , in which the com - monplace father is the ruler of his household , though he is more under the domination of his wife than he supposes .

		It moves slowly at first , but the figures correspond so closely to actuality that one soon finds oneself engrossed .

		Presently the youngest of the family develops talent as an actress .

		At seventeen she becomes the leading lady at the chief
London	LOCATION	theatre and her parents find themselves in possession of more money than they had ever expected to control .

		A progressive atrophy of the finer moral sense sets in , affecting everybody but the actress daughter , who meets her fate through the sheer ignorance in which her mother had chosen to rear her .

		She falls in love with a man whom she learns is married only at the very close of the tale .

		From the simplicity of straightened circumstances and remoteness from metropolitan life , the argument proceeds through greater and more marked complications until it closes in a cluster of situations , involving every member of the family but one , so entangled that the delighted reader can almost imagine another story for its unravelling .

		The humor of the story , which is genuine , lies wholly between the lines ; and there , too , will be found social satire of an unusual sort .

		What lack of sentiment and , it may be added , lack of humor will do for a public career that bids fair to be remarkably useful and successful is set forth in `` The Blind Spot '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- by Mr.
Justus Miles Forman	PERSON	.

		The protagonist of the book , a reformer , is contrasted with a young man of promise who has been spoiled by money .

		The man of the world learns much from the re - former , who , shaping his thoughts strictly accord - ing to '' common sense , '' is quite unable to learn anything from him .

		Presently the positions of the two automatically reverse themselves , the pro- tagonist 's lack of feeling running him into colli - sion with the community 's actual common sense , which he suddenly learns has also the meaning of common sensibility .

		There is a love story with a rather foregone conclusion holding the narrative together .

		The book is a good one , and it narrowly escapes being much better .

		Someone with that marked aptitude for odious - ness which marks comparisons , calls Mr.
Bruno Lessing	PERSON	'' the Kipling of the Ghetto . ''

		He is noth - ing of the sort ; two writers more in contrast can hardly be found in the range of current fiction .

		In theme and treatment Mr.
Lessing	PERSON	's '' With the Best Intention '' -LRB-
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- recalls Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's early tales of the sclinorrer in
London	LOCATION	, the chief difference being due to the scene .

		The stories are short , only one small group being linked by any - thing more than the personality of the lovable , but not very much loved , Jewish scamp who moves throiigh them .

		But , as with most picaresque tales , there is an abundance of humor , and some of the situations are certain to provoke laughter , though not to arouse sympathy .

		Melodrama is always capable of exciting inter - est , with or without profit .

		Consequently Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	's '' Maid of the Mist '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- will be found worthy of passing an hour or two with , and that not without profit .

		The earlier chapters are merely a means to get the hero on the sea and quite thoroughly shipwrecked .

		With one other
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 391 survivor he comes ashore at
Sable Island	LOCATION	, in the north
Atlantic	LOCATION	, at a point where many a tall ship had gone to her doom .

		The other survivor is half Scotch reaver , half Spanish buccaneer .

		The wrecked ships furnish life , until presently there is driven ashore a beautiful girl .

		The hero comes into her good graces , the villain dies as a result of rum , and presently the two marry one another a vastly more sensible arrangement than is usually allowed to prevail in such cases .

		In reading Miss
Marie Van Vorst	PERSON	's '' Big Tre - maine '' -LRB- Little .


Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- one has the feeling of having come upon it before .

		Its elements are an accused and deeply wronged brother , who returns to his old
Virginia	LOCATION	home after having amassed millions ; he restores the family estates , rejects the advances of the girl who had scorned him for his guilty brother , and finds his fate in a younger and more charming person whose father he en - riches .

		One touch of originality closes the book : to crown him with the final palms of triumph he is nominated to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	!

		It is romance , of an ordinary sort , with types rather than persons for characters .

		Sword-and-cloak romance has been outside of the purview of contemporary fiction for so long that `` Ashes of Vengeance : A Romance of Old
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
McBride	ORGANIZATION	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Miss H. B. Sbmerville	PERSON	, has a pleasant and reminiscent flavor , a little of Scott , more than a touch of
Dumas	PERSON	, and the general air of an older and more gallant day .

		It opens with the massacre of
St. Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	.

		A Huguenot lover and his affianced bride are saved from death by the ancient enemy of the family , who exacts what he supposes to be an enduring vengeance .

		The affianced one fades away so quickly that one wonders of the need for her at all , and the enemies become reconciled through the newer love that befalls the Huguenot hero and his foe 's beloved sister .

		Mrs.
Gertrude Pahlow	PERSON	in `` The Gilded Chry - salis '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- labors under the disadvantage of having chosen for her protagonist such a fool of a girl that most of her book passes in the defence of her -LRB- in the reader 's mind -RRB- from the charge of congenital idiocy ; it is safe to say that no mere man could ever have thought out a female char - acter so steeped in improbable folly .

		This young person marries a man of character and achieve - ment , professor of science in a flourishing college .

		She proceeds to alienate his friends , squander his property , involve herself in a preposterous scandal with an undergraduate , and , having ruined his future with a positively German thoroughness , to run away .

		Eventually she learns to wash dishes , and returns to show him her new accomplishment .

		His delight is enormous , proving that he is almost as much of a featherhead as she .

		Light in manner to the verge of flippancy , Miss
Sara Jeannette Duncan	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Everard Coates	PERSON	-RRB- writes '' His Royal Happiness '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- in the interests of an Anglo-American alliance .

		She suc - ceeds at the close in having a treaty to that end passed by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, whereupon it develops that , to make it more binding , the
King of England	ORGANIZATION	has taken to wife the daughter of the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The book is addressed to young women of the lackadaisical age , if there are any left , and abounds in slang , which Mrs.
Coates	PERSON	's life in
America	LOCATION	has enabled her to reproduce accu - rately .

		It takes either a brave man or a secluded one to write against the equal rights of woman in these days .

		Mr.
William Jasper Nicholls	PERSON	is the man , and '' Wild Mustard '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is the writing .

		Those who favor woman suffrage in the book are ill-tempered and unseemly to the eye ; those who do not are gracious and fair to view .

		One man stands out for it , and he is arrested for stealing his host 's overcoat , being apparently guilty also of bigamy .

		After a brief experiment , the lovely young heroine , in whose mind sprang the weed -LRB- wild mustard -RRB- of equal rights , reforms and comes home to marry a perfectly sweet young man and try to be as good a woman as her mother was before her . ''

		The Gaunt Gray Wolf : A Tale of Adventure with ' Ungava Bob ' '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- is one of those books of Labrador that Mr.
Dillon Wallace	PERSON	knows so well how to write , abounding in scenes of strug - gle against the forces of nature in their bitterest form and shot through from cover to cover with a faith in things above and beyond ourselves .

		The chief characters are two of those whom God helps because they help themselves , one a rich young
Boston	LOCATION	college man , the other a brave and hardy son of the North .

		The book is one of real adven - ture , set down with knowledge and sympathy .

		No one writes more genial genre stories than Mr.
W. W. Jacobs	PERSON	, and the latest volume of them , `` Night Watches '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is no exception to its predecessors .

		The night-watchman plays his humorous part , and several others are introduced for variety and good measure .

		One of the best of the stories has a laughable ghost or two in it , and there is a contrast in the form of a real ghost story which will make very creepy reading indeed late at night .

		BRIEFS off NEW BOOKS .

		Six con men of Dr.
Edwin E. Slosson	PERSON	, the literary editor of `` The Inde - pendent , '' has reissued in book - form six essays under the title of `` Major Prophets of To-day '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which first appeared in substantially their present form in the columns of his periodi - cal .

		The list selected includes the names of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Bergson	PERSON	,
Poincare	LOCATION	,
Ostwald	PERSON	, and
Haeckel	PERSON	.

		Among the prophets originally dis - cussed were also
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	,
Chesterton	LOCATION	,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, and
John Dewey	PERSON	, but these latter have apparently not been deemed worthy of the first rank , or perhaps they merely await the publication of a companion volume .

		Dr.
Slosson	PERSON	is by training a natural scientist but has somehow strayed into the paths of literary criticism .

		The scientific habit of mind , he keeps assuring us , is wholly compatible with 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	a love of art and even with a feeling for mys - ticism , which is only religion verified by the experimental method .

		He believes that the true aim of all knowledge will eventually be recognized to be prevision , just as that is now the avowed aim of science .

		This point of view naturally leads to a disparagement of the value of history and indeed of all other studies which turn men 's eyes backward rather than forward .

		The author is appar - ently untroubled by the fear that a culture which is not deeply rooted in the past may readily prove to be superficial , flatulent , and cocksure .

		Be that as it may , Dr.
Slosson	PERSON	has popularized in a very readable manner the views of certain of the foremost thinkers of the day .

		He has a gift for lucid exposition and the faculty of making his theme appear vital and human .

		Each essay is accompanied by bibliographical instructions to the novice on the way he should approach the author in question .

		Portraits of the six `` prophets '' and accounts of a visit to the home of each serve to lend the book a more vivid appeal .

		The chapters on
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Bergson	PERSON	, and
Ostwald	PERSON	are the most interesting .

		It would have been well if the chapter devoted to Pro- fessor
Haeckel	PERSON	had been placed before the one on Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	in such a way as to show how the now discredited materialistic mon - ism of the former has given place to the more acceptable energy-monism of the latter .

		The essay on
M. Bergson	PERSON	furnishes a temptingly easy approach to a philosopher who is much harder to understand than he is generally re - puted to be .

		His philosophy is described as a constructive system based on pragmatic criti - cism .

		It is to be noted also that it is
M. Poincare	PERSON	's pragmatism which attracts the writer 's sympathy .

		According to Dr.
Slos	PERSON	- son , time and personality are for
M. Bergson	PERSON	immediate data of our consciousness .

		The freedom of the will , which is involved in the very essence of personality , is likewise intui - tively felt .

		Art , then , is invaluable because it gives us a more direct vision of reality and strengthens the faculty of intuition , which our rationalistic modes of thought have tended to obscure .

		It is interesting to learn the fact that
M. Bergson	PERSON	in one of his lectures in
New York	LOCATION	replied affirmatively to the question whether he believed in immortality or not .

		It may be inferred from various tokens that his next great work will deal more directly with the problems of religion .

		Dr.
Slosson	PERSON	finds
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	to be less an original thinker than an exquisitely sensitive personality who is able to catch the dominant notes of the time in which he lives and give them artistic ex - pression .

		The gifted Belgian is a believer in science and democracy ; he is an optimist who has a rich dower of faith , though in whom or what it would be difficult to say .

		No attempt is made to balance the essays against the plays or to determine relative literary values .

		A conspicuous illustration of A handbook of the widespread need for a work European drama .

		.

		, which may serve as a popular handbook for the study of the continental drama is the appearance of just such a book .

		This is `` The Continental Drama of To-day , '' with its properly descriptive sub - title `` Out - lines for Its Study , '' by Mr.
Barrett H. Clark	PERSON	.

		In his Preface the author promises to follow this volume with one to be entitled `` British and American Drama of To-day : Outlines for Its Study . ''

		The volume already pub - lished deals with
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, Bjb ` rnson ,
Strindberg	LOCATION	,
Tolstoi	LOCATION	,
Gorki	LOCATION	,
Tchekoff	LOCATION	,
Andreyeff	LOCATION	,
Haupt	PERSON	- mann ,
Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Wedekind	PERSON	,
Schnitzler	PERSON	,
Von Hofmannsthal	PERSON	,
Becque	LOCATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, Eos - tand ,
Brieux	LOCATION	,

Giacosa	PERSON	,
Donnay	LOCATION	,
Lemaitre	PERSON	,
Lavedan	LOCATION	,
D'Annunzio	PERSON	,
Echegaray	PERSON	, and
Galdos	PERSON	.

		The book opens with a chapter of exposition awkwardly entitled `` What Con - stitutes a Play . ''

		This is obviously written for the uninitiated reader ; and while clear enough , is marked by the lack of the note of self-reliance a lack which vitiates so much of American criticism .

		A brief sketch , a few pages in length , in two parts first biograph - ical , then critical heads the chapter on each individual dramatist .

		This is followed by a chronologically arranged list of plays , giving both date of publication and date of produc - tion -LRB- presumably first production , though the place of production , unfortunately , is not given only the year -RRB- .

		The list is followed by a bibliography of such plays of the drama - tist in question as have been translated into English to which is appended a list of ref - erences to the most important books and maga - zine articles dealing with the dramatist and his plays .

		The chapter closes with an outline for the study of one or more of the plays of the dramatist treated , only those plays which have been translated into English being in - cluded in the outline .

		For example , under
Gorki	PERSON	, there is an outline for only one play , `` The Lower Depths , '' while under Ibsen there are outlines for six plays : `` The Pre - tenders , '' `` Brand , '' `` Peer Gynt , '' `` A Doll 's
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' ``
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	, '' `` The Master Builder . ''

		The outline usually gives a brief but suggestive summary of the play , followed by a number of subjects proposed for inquiry , investigation , and study .

		These outlines are , of necessity , fragmentary ; yet if conscien -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 393 tiously followed by the interested reader or student , they should leave him - with a clear and well-reasoned conception of the play , its purport , art , and technic .

		The bibliographical lists and references are sufficiently full and accurate , in general ; but there are a number of singular and conspicuous omissions .

		Yet this is a useful book which Mr.
Clark	PERSON	has put together with great patience , care , and indus - try .

		It will prove valuable to the student as a brief reference-bibliography ; to the club member who is following a course in the mod - ern drama it will prove invaluable .

		One can not restrain a sense of mild amusement , from time to time , however , over the little sketches of the dramatists especially those obviously manufactured from secondary sources .

		An ingenuous Mr.
Richard Curie	PERSON	is evidently study of possessed of one of the primary Mr.
Joseph	PERSON	r - i _ .

		Conrad 's novels , qualifications tor writing about Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	an enthusiasm for the subject .

		It is unfortunate that he has none of the others .

		His book is an amusing per - sonal document rather than a contribution to criticism .

		He has a predilection for an - nouncing his intentions , as if he believed them to be extraordinary .

		Occasionally he is mod - est , as when , at the beginning of Chapter II .

		he says : '' In this chapter I mean to give , first of all , in a perfectly concise and colourless form , the salient facts of
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's life up to the time of his leaving the sea , and then I mean to examine in a more literary and romantic sense his two books of recol - lections , -LRB- Some Reminiscences ' and ' The Mirror of the Sea . '

		And I hope to throw some light on the autobiographical basis of many of
Conrad	ORGANIZATION	's stories .

		But I would like to say , straight off , that this chapter will not be of much value to the critic for , like the one that follows it , it is informative rather than critical .

		That stands to reason . ''

		It must be admitted that the chapter is of no more value to the critic than he promises it will be .

		Mr.
Curie	PERSON	's attempts to identify Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's artistic achievement are apparently informed by wide reading but they are floun - dering ones , just the same : '' In my opinion realists are the only true artists in fiction .

		And I do not mean the realism of a Zola which is coarseness or the realism of a
Dick	PERSON	- ens which is caricature I mean , essentially , the realism of a writer like
Turgenev or Conrad	ORGANIZATION	, the realism , in fact , of typical and distinguished re - ality .


Anthony Trollope	PERSON	, it is true , is a realist , but he has obviously a second-rate intelligence and therefore his creations are wanting in the highest actuality .

		They are not imagined with the pas - sionate nuances of real life . ''

		It is as impossible to answer such a paragraph as it is to take it seriously .

		Later on in his book , Mr.
Curie	PERSON	returns to the matter : '' If one looks closely into it one sees , I think , that the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	tradition -LRB- I mean the tradi - tion started by
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	, continued by
Balzac	LOCATION	, and developed by
Flaubert	PERSON	and the Russians -RRB- is not really a way of approaching the novelist 's art so much as the way .

		It is getting down to the bed - rock of imaginative life and surely there is noth - ing beyond that . ''

		But he is unable satisfactorily to explain why he thinks Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	is carrying on the tradi - tion initiated by
Stendhal	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is too bad .

		Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	is a serious artist .

		We should welcome an account of his art that told us something .

		Doubtless Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	would wel - come it .

		But he can hardly relish being told , either directly or by implication , that he `` has not the corrupt simplicity of a
George Moore	PERSON	, '' that most of his few readers quite misunderstand him , and that he represents the only true reaction to the `` poisonous '' lit - erature of the eighteen-nineties -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- An enthusiastic Miss
Kate Stephens	PERSON	, whose list admirer of of publications already includes Greek civilization .

		AmeY -LSB- can Thumb _ p rints '' and `` Delphic Kansas , '' now harks back to her interest in Greek literature and archaeology , in a volume entitled `` The Greek Spirit : Phases of Its Progression in Religion , Polity , Philosophy , and Art '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has very excellent intentions , and honestly tries to let mankind from
Kansas	LOCATION	to
New York	LOCATION	survey the latest notions about - ^ gean civilization , for the betterment of American culture .

		Unfortunately , in one way and another she comes into competition with dangerous rivals , such as
Zielinski	PERSON	in ' ' Our Debt to Antiquity , ' ' Butcher in ' ' Some Aspects of the Greek Genius , ''
Gildersleeve	PERSON	in `` Hellas and
Hesperia	LOCATION	, '' and
Livingstone	PERSON	-LRB- if we dare mention him in the same sentence with
Gildersleeve	PERSON	-RRB- in `` The Greek Genius and Its Meaning to Us . ' '

		If the unpleasant truth must be told , in this competition Miss Ste - phens fares ill , partly because
Livingstone	PERSON	,
Gildersleeve	LOCATION	, Butcher , and
Zielinski	PERSON	write with coherence .

		Their subjects and predi - cates do not generally play hide-and-seek with the reader as in this : `` Cereals grew in sun - lit tillage , the grape sacred through its use in the religions of many peoples , the gray-green olive , other esculent fruits , and horned cattle grazed in meadows dotted by benefactive for - est trees . ''

		We find an American thumb - print in the use of `` humans '' in the sense of men and women , and an unhyphened , half - German locution in the ugly words , `` their 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	art gift . ''

		There are interesting passages in the volume , but on the whole it must be de - scribed as chaotic .

		Mr.
George Ives	PERSON	has written a Sr * bitter book in '' A History of Penal Methods : Criminals , Witches , Lunatics ' ' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		His account of the organized , systematized , and legal inven - tions of revenge which have assumed the name of justice down to our own times is a tragic story .

		When we have read how learned judges , acute lawyers , gowned bishops , sedate scholars , have gravely worked out these dia - bolical torments , we are in a better position to understand why , after a half century of peace and civilization ,
Europe	LOCATION	is now sud - denly transformed into `` a wilderness of fierce wolves . ''

		The contrast between the finest culture of
England	LOCATION	in the nineteenth century and its treatment of working people and prisoners is amazing , almost incredible ; it reminds one of the vineyards and flower gardens on the slopes of smoking Vesuvius .

		At least this much is made clear by Mr.
Ives	PERSON	's almost tedious compilation of resurrected hor - rors : that hate never made men kind , that revenge under the respectable name of justice never made the wicked good , that force and repression have no power to make men free and competent citizens .

		Mr.
Ives	PERSON	has done well to ask for educational treatment , for mercy , forgiveness , brotherly help , probation , parole , reformatory process .

		The one dark spot in his book -LRB- and one wholly contradictory to his general tendency -RRB- is his recommenda - tion that confirmed criminals , after several convictions , should be put to death .

		He says `` painless death '' ; but there is no form of capital punishment which does not brutalize the public and divert attention and effort from rational means of reformation .

		Mr.
J. E. Crawford Flitch	PERSON	's `` An Idler in
Spain	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
McBride	ORGANIZATION	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the record of a
Goya	ORGANIZATION	pilgrimage to
Barcelona	LOCATION	,
Saragossa	LOCATION	,
Madrid	LOCATION	,
Toledo	LOCATION	, and one or two small towns , by an Englishman who loves the more human phases of literature , painting , and travel , and writes of them in a sincere and unconventional , genial and attractive , though at times some - what garrulous , page .

		`` Goya and Spanish Character '' is a title which would better describe the book , for it is not mere art criticism , and
Goya	ORGANIZATION	is only one of two chief interests , each of which illuminates the other .

		The second half of the work far exceeds the first in compactness and substantiality .

		From Chapter IX. , on `` The Portraits , '' both inter - ests are intensified .

		Those unacquainted with
Goya	ORGANIZATION	will be interested in the comment on the life and character of ever-fascinating
Spain Spain	LOCATION	, ' ' which will always remain an un - discovered country , for the reason that there are few who have the intrepidity of spirit necessary to discover it . ''

		An address at the beginning to
Don Miguel de Unamuno	ORGANIZATION	, and frequent references to his opinions , add to the interest of the book for those who have a per - sonal or literary acquaintance with the bril - liant Rector of
the University of Salamanca	ORGANIZATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The opinions of Dr.
William D. H. Brown	PERSON	, the author of '' Good Health and Long Life , '' are con - servative .

		He leans decidedly to the side of cau - tion in such matters as diet , baths , and tobacco .

		His statement of the case is invariably one to be easily understood by the lay person .

		The volume is published by the author .

		Mr.
William S. Walsh	PERSON	has compiled a useful book in '' Heroes and Heroines of Fiction : Mod - ern Prose and Poetry '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The sub - title promises '' famous characters and famous names in novels , romances , poems , and dramas classified , analyzed and criticized , with supplemen - tary citations from the best authorities . ''

		The text fulfils this promise in the main , although the list is not , of course , complete .

		Professor
Allen Porterfield	PERSON	's '' Outline of Ger - man Romanticism '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is marked by an enthusiasm unconventional in a text-book .

		He has written it as if he enjoyed the task , `` for the benefit of advanced students and those who teach advanced students . ''

		So much spirit is pleasant to discover , and all the more so when it seems to have contributed to , rather than detracted from , the book 's usefulness as a compilation of facts .

		Not immediately connected with the European war , but with obvious bearing upon it , is '' War 's Aftermath '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , by Messrs.
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	and
Harvey E. Jordan	PERSON	.

		It is an attempt to form some measure of the effects on the south - ern states of the Union of the reversed selection due to the loss of life in the Civil War .

		It con - sists of replies to a questionnaire sent to men of various stations , and is accordingly a compilation of opinions rather than a scientific study .

		Its con - clusion is that the war '' seriously impoverished this country of its best human values . ''

		`` A Guide to Gothic Architecture , '' by Mr.
T. Francis Bumpus	PERSON	-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is primarily for the Englishman with an architectural hobby , and the number of others to whom it will appeal is limited .

		In spite of the general scope of its title , its main thread is the development of mediaeval art in
England	LOCATION	, and buildings in other countries are brought in only for comparison .

		In the numerous half-tones continental architecture fares better than in the text .

		The author of '' The Cathedrals 1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 395 of
England	LOCATION	'' writes loosely , for a popular audi - ence still swayed by Ruskinian prejudices and undisturbed by the progress of research .

		The `` Fireside Edition '' of Mr.
William T. Hornaday	PERSON	's work , '' The New American Natural History '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is in four amply illustrated volumes .

		There are sixteen plates in color besides many reproductions of drawings and photographs and numerous charts and maps .

		Mr.
Hornaday	PERSON	felt in
1904	DATE	, when the original edition was pub - lished , that '' the time was ripe for the publication of a work which , while scientifically accurate , would ... be read through for entertainment before being placed on the shelf for reference . ''

		The result was a well-written book , especially adapted to the young student , as well as to the amateur .

		A sort of book impossible only a few years ago , but now becoming familiar , is entitled `` Life and Law : The Development and Exercise of the Sex Function , together with a Study of the
Effect of Certain Natural	ORGANIZATION	and Human Laws , and a Con - sideration of the Hygiene of Sex '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by Miss
Maude Glasgow	PERSON	,
M.D.	LOCATION	.

		It is intended for grown folk , but will serve as a basis for informa - tion to be given the young .

		Dr.
Glasgow	LOCATION	is an uncompromising believer in the feminine almost to the extent of looking upon mere maleness as a necessary evil , brought late into the universe to supplement the female .

		This leads to a statement as rash as this : '' The superior morality of woman is undisputed . ''

		The superior morality of one sex or the other does not exist .

		It is evident how the result is reached by the writer , for there is a ten - dency from one cover of the book to the other to regard the good in man as due to woman , and the evil in woman as due to man .

		This , it need hardly be stated , is no more true than that woman 's supe - rior morality is undisputed .

		But the book has its value notwithstanding this bit of pharisaism .

		Sixth in the series of little books known as '' Constable 's Modern Biographies , '' published in this country by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, appears an intimate account of '' Dr.
Barnardo	PERSON	as I Knew Him , '' by
Miss A. R. Neuman	PERSON	, one of his secre - taries and helpers .

		It is now nine years since the death of the benevolent founder of the well-known and numerous homes for destitute children , and seven years since the issue of his biography by his widow and Mr.
J. Marchant	PERSON	.

		Miss
Neuman	PERSON	's smaller work presents the man in his daily activi - ties and familiar conversation with his associates a most lovable character and an untiring toiler for the waifs of
London	LOCATION	and of
England	LOCATION	gener - ally , of whom more than sixty thousand were cared for by his organization in his lifetime in no fewer than sixty-five homes , including the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian branches .

		In her outline of Dr.
Barnardo	PERSON	's life Miss
Neuman	PERSON	gives him one more year than the short span actually allowed him , but corrects the error in an appended '' Chronological Sum - mary . ''

		Nowhere in her book , curiously enough , do we find her hero 's name given in full ,
Thomas John Barnardo	PERSON	, though the index supplies his initials .

		470 THE HOLIDAY BOOK MUSTER .

		Military terms and martial imagery have ousted the nomenclature and the metaphors of peace .

		Therefore it is not unnatural at this time to view the annual procession of holiday publications as an army on its way to the front to the bookshop where , as on the firing line in battle , it faces the risk of defeat as well as the prospect of victory .

		But the defeat is never a total rout , nor is the victory ever unclouded by partial failure .

		Certain parts of the formation , occasional units in the brave array , encounter disaster or achieve success , as the case may be , and with the com - ing of another season the lines are reformed and the battle goes on as before .

		A few of the wounded may recover and return to the front , perhaps in even better fighting condition than before , but most of those that fall in the first charge go down never to rise again .

		Instances like the now acknowledged masterpiece of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, which for a long time lay disregarded among the refuse marked down in desperation to a penny by the undiscerning dealer in literary odds and ends , and was at last rescued from oblivion only by what might seem a lucky accident , are so rare as to enjoy a quite peculiar fame of their own .

		`` What constitutes a holiday book , it would be hard to define precisely , and the term is here used loosely to cover the general literary harvest of the closing year .

		But , not to ex - change military for agricultural phraseology , not to beat prematurely our swords into ploughshares and our spears into pruning - hooks , let us continue for a brief moment to review the ranks and files of this array of the season 's books as a martial host equipped for conflict .

		The soldiers of the first line what in military language is called the active army engage our most interested attention .

		A good account of themselves is sure to be ren - dered by these trained and disciplined fight - ers .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, for instance , as repre - sented by his new book , and Mr.
Crothers	PERSON	in his timely reflections on Votes for Women , and Mr.
H. G. `` Wells	PERSON	in his latest novel , and Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	in his volume of poems , with half a hundred others that might be named , 440 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	may be relied upon to acquit themselves cred - itably .

		But they will not lack the support of the reserves and the younger recruits , of the
Landwehr	PERSON	and the Landsturm , and there will be no gap in the battle front that is not speed - ily filled up from the rear .

		Among the veterans who might have been thought to have earned their honorable retire - ment , but who are now recalled to service by the exigencies of the hour , one may note Mr.
Norman Angell Lane	PERSON	's well-known work , `` The Great Illusion , '' revised and supple - mented , and the late
Emil Reich	PERSON	's `` Ger - many 's Swelled Head , '' also brought up to date , and Mr.
Arthur Bullard	PERSON	's ``
Panama	LOCATION	, '' enlarged , and also the usual number of re - printed and re-illustrated favorites in ro - mance and poetry , history and biography and travel .

		The new recruits necessarily include some , perhaps many , who are destined to receive grievous wounds and to lie moaning in pain on the battlefield , somewhat as the sixteen-year-old boys now forced to the front in eastern
Germany	LOCATION	are found in pitiful plight by the advancing Russians and are heard to admit that this is their first expe - rience in handling a rifle , their first participa - tion in military manoeuvres .

		And a few rather decrepit old soldiers , gallantly striving to hide their infirmities , are detected by a sharp eye as the forces continue their march .

		Some of the devices adopted , by those skilled in such things , to give an appearance of newness and unimpaired serviceability to what might otherwise fail to pass muster , are more interesting to the philosophical observer than highly creditable to their authors .

		For example , and with a shifting of imagery from the army to the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, a dummy funnel of painted canvas , like that which enabled the late unlamented ' '
Emden	LOCATION	' ' to deceive her foes and strew the seas with wrecked merchant - men , is often rigged up on an ancient craft to make it pass for a new battleship of latest equipment .

		A special preface , of little or no value in itself , is provided for a half - forgotten book on which the copyright may have ex - pired , or which may never have been copy - righted in this country , and on the strength of this trifling addition copyright in the current year is obtained -LRB- for the preface alone , of course , though no explanation to that effect is printed -RRB- , and the heedless purchaser imagines he has secured a new work of literature .

		Or , with greater audacity , a classic may be re - issued under a new title and passed off as a book of the season .

		Four years ago an enter - prising publisher thus brought out
Miss Mit	ORGANIZATION	- ford 's `` Our Village '' with a transmogrified title-page even the author 's name , whether by accident or design , being slightly changed and with a lavish addition of unrelated pic - torial matter that doubtless helped to palm the volume off upon the inexperienced as a fresh and eminently desirable literary creation .

		The imperfect fitting of a stock of miscella - neous pictures to almost any old book capable of illustration is a time-honored and some - times commercially successful device of the expert holiday-book-manufacturer .

		Another very simple and often deceptive expedient of the wide-awake publisher is the omission of the date at the foot of an author 's preface when it is desired to give an air of youth to a book no longer in its infancy ; and if the work is presented in new typography and with other modern details , the result is not seldom gratifying in more ways than one .

		This present season witnesses , for instance , the resuscitation of two works -LRB- Mr.
Percy Fitz	PERSON	- gerald 's `` Book Fancier '' and
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's `` Oxford '' -RRB- that deserve to succeed on their unaided merits , though they originally ap - peared twenty-eight and twenty-four years ago , respectively .

		Now , in all the pride of new print and the luxury of ample margins , and in one case with new illustrations , and also , in both instances , with discreet avoidance of any hint as to their having lost the bloom of youth , they take their places confidently and imposingly among the publications of the current year .

		At least one reviewer has al - ready discussed Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	's excellent book as if it were a new production .

		But if there be any imposition in the matter , the pub - lishers might well enough plead that it is in a good cause .

		If deserving old books will not be bought and read for their own sakes and in their undisguised oldness , let them be out - wardly rejuvenated and made to win fresh triumphs by virtue of their rejuvenation .

		The war machine must in all its parts be up-to-date , and a little ahead of date if possi - ble , to win the victory ; and so the army of books must each year have new uniforms and the most modern of equipment if it is to con - quer the great public 's inborn reluctance to be separated from its money .

		Or , at any rate , such is the prevailing impression among those versed in such recondite matters .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , 441 GERMAN CULTURE .

		Slights and insults rankle worse than in - juries .

		For any people to put on airs of superiority to their neighbors is to evoke a vindictive spirit .

		The South , at the beginning of the Civil War , called the Northerners * ' mud-sills ' ' and ' ' barbarians , ' ' and an - nounced the purpose of imposing its own civilization upon them .

		There has been a similar exhibition of self-satisfaction and vain-glory among the Germans of late .

		It has been a sudden explosion , for ordinarily the Germans have been the most modest of people .

		Shakespeare has been their national poet .

		They have welcomed and naturalized
Cal	LOCATION	- deron and
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	and
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is hardly too much to say that a good half of German literature consists of commentaries on foreign literature and art .

		Goethe , speaking of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, said : * ' It is well for us little men to stand humbly in the presence of the mas - ters . ''

		And he rebuked those who tried to raise up
Tieck	PERSON	as a rival to himself , by saying that it was as absurd as if he should try to equal himself with
Shakespeare	PERSON	, who was an immeasurably greater power .

		But now the Germans are crying themselves up as superior to everybody else .

		We confess to a weakness for
Germany	LOCATION	, be - cause of the cult of genius which has , inter - mittently , prevailed in that country for nearly two hundred years .

		It began with
Frederick the Great	PERSON	's experiment with
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, was con - tinued by the
Weimar Court	ORGANIZATION	through two gen - erations of poets and musicians , and was practised in one way or another by various other courts and states .

		Finally , perhaps a , day after the fair , it was taken up by the great Philistine people themselves .

		An attempt has really been made for efficiency , an effort to get every one in his right place and to recog - nize and reward talent .

		That this attempt has come off , has been successful , seems doubtful .

		Heine was an exile and his works were pro- scribed .


Wagner	PERSON	was an exile , and was kept in extreme poverty for twenty years while he was doing his great work .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	and
Nietzsche	PERSON	were utterly neglected in their life - times , though their pupils and imitators have been loaded with honors .

		The best of the mod - ern German artists have had a hard struggle , while popular favor and the patronage of the great went to their inferior rivals .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	, as elsewhere , fortune has usually turned genius from the door while she has ushered the great , pre-eminent dunces to the feast .

		If it were merely a question of contempo - rary German culture , we should be disposed instantly to reject their claims to superiority .

		Their literature , the literature of
Hauptmann	PERSON	and
Sudermann	PERSON	and
Wedekind	PERSON	, seems to us enormously inferior to the work of their classic epoch .

		It is a muddle of rather sickly ideal - ism and naturalism of the most pernicious sort .

		The imaginative reason does not shine through it so clearly as through the contem - porary work in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		In music we believe the Germans have allowed themselves at last to be distanced by the com - posers of other countries .

		In art we may call up as a witness the great critic of modern painting ,
Herr Meier-Graefe	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is a German and , if the newspaper report of his recent utterances be correct , a prejudiced and im - placable one .

		In the chapters of his work on modern art devoted to
Germany	LOCATION	, he labors faithfully to set forth the claims of recent German artists , but the impression he gives is that he considers them meritorious and re - spectable .

		He certainly does not write of them with the enthusiasm and whole-hearted praise he bestows on Constable and
Delacroix	PERSON	and Manet and
Cezanne	ORGANIZATION	.

		In civics , owing to intelligent state action and supervision , Ger - many has undoubtedly achieved success .

		All observers admit that the ordinary affairs of life are better ordered there than anywhere else .

		Whether or not , in order to get such results , other races would submit to such drill and discipline may be questioned .

		A good many people object to be vaccinated for small - pox , and we imagine the mass of mankind will refuse to be inoculated for civic comfort and welfare .

		But when we come to the culture of the Germanic peoples in the past , there is enough to give us pause in our rejection of their claims .

		This inquiry is matter for a volume , not for a slight essay , and no one man 's knowledge would suffice .

		We can only give what seems to be the general opinion of the world , eked out by our own hazardous guesses .

		The first thing to decide is : Who are the Teutons ?

		We suppose that
Holland	PERSON	and the Low Countries generally would have to be yoked with the present German Empire and
Austria	LOCATION	as generically and historically related .

		The second question would be : What is cul - ture ?

		Without prejudice to other human activities we will take architecture , art , music , literature , philosophy , science , manners , and war as covering what is usually .

		accounted culture .

		If Gothic architecture could be attributed to the Teutons , they would stand side by side with the Greeks in this important field .

		But the credit must be shared with the Byzantines , the French , the Spanish , and the English ; 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	so that they have no superiority here .

		Giving to the Teutons the art of the Low Countries , which we feel is a stretch of generosity , they stand out equal to the Italians and superior to all other modern peoples .

		A good many critics believe Rembrandt the greatest painter of the world .

		In music it is hardly worth while to register rivals or seconds the Teu - tons are supreme .

		There is very little German creative litera - ture which is greatly original and still less which has the classic perfection that can defy time .

		In the drama and the novel it has al - ways followed foreign fashions .

		How much of German poetry is absolutely first rate ?

		The first part of
Faust	LOCATION	and a quantity of ballads and lyrics perhaps .

		Even this much hardly has that stamp of style which is common in
Greek	LOCATION	,
Latin	LOCATION	, Italian , and English poetry .

		There is probably more of the ultimate per - fections of poetry in the forty lines of ' ' Kubla Khan '' than in the entire extant body of German verse .

		Goethe knew very well that distinction was the one thing that German literature lacked , and he strove all his life to attain it .

		But either something in the lan - guage or a deep strain of homeliness in the Germanic nature , was against him .

		The first great monument of German poetry , the ' ' Nibelungenlied , '' is perhaps typical of what the race can do in this field .

		It is in a way the most tremendous picture of human life ever unrolled .

		But it is clumsy in de - sign and pedestrian and garrulous in execu - tion .

		It borrowed much from the Norse sagas , but it did not borrow their brevity and brilliance .

		All this is not to say that German poetry is lacking in great and lasting quali - ties .

		It is rich in thought , full of music , and more pregnant with emotion and sentiment than the poetry of any other race .

		Its very homespun quality has been its fortune in the modern world which has grown impatient of silks and satins and cloth of gold .

		In all the lines of criticism , however , it is superior to any other .

		French criticism , which is usually set up against it , is mostly a kind of glorified gossip .

		German philosophy ranks with that of the Greeks and Hindus .

		It is perhaps not so original as either of these others .

		Kant was deeply indebted to
Hume	PERSON	; his successors ,
Schelling	PERSON	, Fichte , and
Hegel	PERSON	, pillaged the pre - Socratic Greek thinkers ; and
Schopenhauer	PERSON	,
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, and
Eucken	PERSON	went back to the Asiatics .

		However , there is no more consid - erable or important body of thought in any modern language .

		When it comes to the question of science , pure and applied , we are tempted to say to all the contending rivals : ' ' You are all
Hidalgo 's	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		It would be a hard matter to decide between
Germany	LOCATION	with
Kepler	PERSON	,
Copernicus	PERSON	, and Gut - enberg ;
Italy	LOCATION	with
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	,
Galvani	PERSON	, and
Columbus	LOCATION	;
France	LOCATION	with an almost intermin - able band of astronomers and physicists ; and
England	LOCATION	with
Bacon	PERSON	,
Newton	LOCATION	,
Darwin	PERSON	, and
Watts	LOCATION	.

		If the balance inclines at all , we should say it was in the favor of
England	LOCATION	.

		The manners of a people are a delicate sub - ject to criticize .

		Every nation has its own ideal .

		Every nation , however , has openly or covertly admitted that the French are polite .

		If this gallant and charming people have a rival in manners , it is in the more stately and serious Spanish .

		The Germans have a homely kindliness of nature , and , for aught we know , individuals among them may pos - sess all the fineness and polish of the Arab or Parisian .

		This grand style does not come out in their literature or biographies .

		The great Goethe alternated his love letters to
Charlotte	LOCATION	von
Stein	PERSON	by sending her presents of cabbage-soup .

		And the recent philosophy dominant in
Germany	LOCATION	certainly would seem to crush out the very elements of politeness .

		There is no Fontenoy business , `` The French never fire first , '' about it .

		Whatever Niet - zsche 's philosophy may be in the point of morals and for our part we think it merely carries to a logical extreme the doctrines and discoveries of
Carlyle	LOCATION	and
Darwin	PERSON	however it may show in morals , it is horribly disas - trous to manners . ''

		The Will to Power '' is the absolute antithesis to noblesse oblige .

		Probably hog wallowing is the way to succeed in life , but the nobler spirits of mankind will always prefer to be beaten with
Don Quixote	PERSON	rather than arrive at the Governorship of an
Island	LOCATION	with
Sancho Panza	PERSON	.

		Lastly , in war there are only three great superdreadnaughts of glory
Alexander	PERSON	,
Caesar	LOCATION	, and
Napoleon	PERSON	.

		Hannibal and
Charle	PERSON	- magne may perhaps be yoked with these .

		Germany with her
Barbarossa	ORGANIZATION	,
Wallenstein	PERSON	,
Frederick the Great	PERSON	, and
Moltke	PERSON	certainly does not outrank
England	LOCATION	with
Alfred	PERSON	,
Cromwell	PERSON	,
Marlborough	LOCATION	,
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wellington	LOCATION	.

		To sum up , if all the various forms of cul - ture can be ranked as equal , then the Teutons may be credited with a greater assortment of gifts for mankind than any other people except the Greeks or the Italians , ancient and modern .

		But there have been a good many of them , and their per capita of the products of culture is probably far less than the French or English .

		And the different forms of cul - ture can not be considered equal .

		Opinions will differ , of course , as to the value of the different arts and activities of mankind .

		But
1914	DATE	-RSB-
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	, 443 there is a pretty general consensus that lit - erature , and especially poetry , is the fine , con - summate flower of mortal effort .

		In poetry , the Germans are babes in swaddling clothes be - side the full-grown English .

		In war and manners they must yield to the French .

		In music alone are they so superior as to be able to say ' ' Here is our throne , let all men bow to it . ''

		It does not seem to us , therefore , that their culture is so overwhelmingly superior to any single European State that they should seek to impose it by force of arms upon the whole world .

		As if culture could be imposed by force !

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		INSULTS TO THE READER 'S INTELLIGENCE , in the form of unnecessary elucidation , super - fluous instruction , excessive elaboration , dem - onstration of the self-evident , expatiation on the commonplace , or any like manner of weariness , are resented by the mentally alert .

		As prone as any others to commit this error of underrating the reader 's intelligence are the didactic and the homiletic writers ; and among didactic writers the authors of arti - cles and handbooks on the administration and use of libraries are not the least of sinners .

		There have recently been published in this department of literature three useful books wherein a reader not maliciously critical might conceivably find passages likely to arouse the resentment above referred to .

		For example , in a handy little manual on `` The Practical Use of Books and Libraries , '' by Mr.
Gilbert O. Ward	PERSON	of the
Cleveland Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, a book intended for `` young per - sons such as high school students and library apprentices , '' the author thinks it necessary to explain that `` a dictionary is an alpha - betical list of the words of a language with their derivations and meanings . ''

		On an - other page he says : `` To use an index , look for the name of what is wanted in its alpha - betical place as in a dictionary or in a tele - phone directory . ''

		Elsewhere he explains that ' ' the TITLE of a book usually gives a hint of the book 's contents . ' '

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's treatise is now in its second and revised and enlarged edition , and is published by the
Boston Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The second of these carefully planned works is entitled `` Books and Libraries : Their Makers and Their Use , ' ' and it is writ - ten by Mr.
Charles Phillips Chipman	PERSON	, libra - rian of
Colby College	ORGANIZATION	, and published by the
Colby Alumnus Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Opening at the elev - enth chapter , one is informed that ' ' a periodi - cal is defined as ' a magazine or other publica - tion which appears at stated or regular inter - vals . '

		The term is not applied to books which are published in parts or sections . ' '

		Near the end of the book a hortatory paragraph bids us , if we would `` make the acquaintance of the greatest minds the world has ever known , learn to read , cultivate the reading habit , and , whatever else you may do , READ . ''

		Perhaps wise advice like this can not be too often re - peated .

		The third of the books under con - sideration is the initial number of a series to be known as `` Classics of American Libra - rianship , '' edited by Dr.
Arthur E. Bostwick	PERSON	of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and pub - lished by the
H. W. Wilson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume in hand is on `` The Relationship between the Library and the Public Schools , '' a favorite and well-worn theme among educators and librarians .

		From the numerous papers of various authorship that the book contains we have space only for the following sound maxim : `` The children 's room should not be planned for student use only , since it should meet the needs of the child as a child , as well as of the child as a student . ' '

		We defy any - one to controvert this .

		THE MOST LIMITED EDITION POSSIBLE is , manifestly , the edition restricted to a single copy .

		Such editions are extremely rare , but not unknown .

		For example ,
Babbage	LOCATION	, of cal - culating-machine fame , was responsible for the issue of a certain remarkable work in twenty-one volumes , each of which was lit - erally unique .

		But before proceeding further let us recall a story that illustrates the pecul - iarities of the man and indicates the bent of his genius .

		Accustomed to wear a nightcap in sleeping , he once found himself away from home without this article of apparel and facing the prospect of both sleeplessness and a cold in the head .

		Reasoning , however , that the imagination is potent in its influence over the bodily senses , he searched his pockets for a piece of string , which he tied over his head and under his chin in such wise as to give much the same feeling as if he had donned his customary head-gear .

		As a result he slept well and suffered no ill effects from the substitu - tion .

		Characteristic , therefore , of his fond - ness for experiment and of his keen attention to the little things of daily life that collec - tively go to make up some of its big things , was his series of studies in the effect on the reader 's eye of different-colored papers and inks in the making of books .

		In order to ascertain exactly what combination of colors or shades would produce the least fatigue , he caused portions of the tables of logarithms to be printed in many colors on paper of many THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	colors .

		This work ,
Babbage	PERSON	's `` Specimens of Logarithmic Tables , '' in twenty-one volumes octavo ,
London	LOCATION	,
1831	DATE	, was limited to one copy ; but who finally became its owner can not here be stated .

		It must have rivalled
Joseph	PERSON	's coat of many colors in its polychromatic ap - pearance .


Sterne	PERSON	's `` Tristram Shandy '' has , at pages 169 , 170 , of volume one , two pieces of marbled paper pasted where the printed matter would regularly have its place . ' '

		Mot - ley emblem of my work , ' ' satirically says the author of this device .

		But it was nothing to
Babbage	PERSON	's motley assortment of paper and printers ' ink in the aforementioned work .

		One hundred and fifty-one colors and shades were represented in the paper used , and the printing was in light and dark blue , light and dark green , light and dark red , olive , yellow , purple , and black ; also , in the last volume there was printing in gold , silver , and copper , on vellum as well as on paper of different colors .

		As this is the year in which tri-cen - tennial honors are being paid to
Napier	PERSON	, the inventor of logarithms , the foregoing may not be altogether unseasonable .

		M.
PIERRE Lori	PERSON	's IMPRESSIONS OF THE WAR , as published in the
Paris	LOCATION	journal , `` L `
Illustra	ORGANIZATION	- tion , `` contain more of poetry than of grim reality ; and yet the scenes that met his eye in a little village of northern
France	LOCATION	were all real enough , the poetic charm lying in his interpretation of them .

		The
October	DATE	sun shone with a kindly warmth that reminded one of
Provence	LOCATION	, while from a distance came the hoarse roar of artillery like the mutterings of a gathering storm .

		`` In the neighboring fields peasants were working as if nothing out of the ordinary had been going on , doubtful however whether the savages who made so much noise over yonder might not come back one of these days and lay waste everything .

		Here and there on the greensward , clustered about little fagot fires , were groups of people who would have seemed pitiable under a sunless sky , but whom the sun managed to make cheerful - even those refugees in flight before the bar - barians , cooking their food as gypsies do , among the bundles of their poor clothes , packed in haste when the frantic flight for safety set in .

		... When we entered the vil - lage the sun was shining with increasing brightness .

		There was a confusion , a jumble , the like of which man had never seen and never will see again after this war , unique in history .

		All the uniforms were there , all the arms of the service , the Scots , the French cuirassiers , the Turcos , the Zouaves , and the Bedouins who give their military salute by raising their hooded cloaks with a stately gesture .

		The church square was filled with enormous English busses which in other times had given communication facilities to Lon - don , and still bore in huge letters the names of certain quarters of that city .

		It will be said that I exaggerate , but truly they had an air of astonishment , these busses , at rolling over French soil and being filled with French soldiers . ''

		Splendidly determined to see the soul of goodness in things evil , Loti thus char - acteristically concludes : `` What good people still live in the world !

		And how the aggres - sion of the German savages has strengthened the sweet , gentle bonds of fraternity among all those who are truly of the human species ! ' '

		THE UNDISMAYED BOOK-COLLECTOR rides his hobby -LRB- he is lucky to have anything to ride in these days when all ridable horses have been commandeered or otherwise appropriated for military use -RRB- and delights in the acquisition of a rare Elzevir or Aldine just as if the fate of nations were not hanging in the balance .

		But , after all , what good would it do for the non-militant world to suspend its customary activities , shocking though it may at first seem to find pleasure in anything when so many thousands of one 's fellow-beings are subjected to unspeakable sufferings ?

		The hammer of the book-auctioneer still continues to knock down the coveted volume to the delighted high - est bidder .

		In
London	LOCATION	the
house of Hodgson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	started a successful book-sale toward the end of
October	DATE	, and greater things in the same branch of trade are in prospect for the new year .

		Some one has recalled the interesting fact that this same firm of
Hodgson & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, or , rather , its founder , had the courage , a century ago , on the very eve of the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, to announce the sale of '' A Miscellaneous Col - lection of Old and New Books in good pres - ervation , ' ' which were to be '' sold by Auction by Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	at his Great Boom -LRB- The Poet 's Gallery -RRB- , No. 39 , Fleet Street , on Fri - day ,
June 16th , 1815	DATE	, and Nine following days -LRB- Sundaj r s excepted -RRB- at 12 o'clock each Day . ''

		If the great battle had not chanced to fall on a
Sunday	DATE	, the peaceful purchase of `` old and new books in good preservation '' would have gone on while cannon were thundering on the now historic plain beyond the
Dover Straits	LOCATION	.

		CONCERNING ``
AMERICA	LOCATION	, '' the national an - them -LRB- as it is also , in its music , the British national anthem , while , to go a little further , it is likewise the air of a German patriotic song -RRB- , certain facts of interest are just now to be noted .

		The original manuscript of the verses , `` My country , 't is of thee , '' com - posed in a spare half-hour at
Andover	LOCATION	Theo -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 445 logical Seminary by
Samuel Francis Smith	PERSON	in
1832	DATE	, has recently been given to the Har -
vard University Library	ORGANIZATION	by the author 's surviving children ; and Librarian Lane , in acknowledging the gift , has promised that when the new building is occupied the pre - cious relic shall be `` made accessible for vis - itors to see . ''

		A little before this interesting occurrence -LRB- the presentation -RRB- there chanced to be revived , in connection with
Baltimore	LOCATION	's `` Star Spangled Banner '' celebration , the question of the authorship of the music of ``
America	LOCATION	'' ; but the settlement of that an - cient dispute remains as remote as before .

		Whether Dr.
Henry Carey	PERSON	, as his partisans maintain , wrote the familiar British song and supplied it with a tune in the year 1740 , or whether , as a certain fitness of things makes one wish to believe , Dr.
John Bull	PERSON	rendered this service to his countrymen on the occasion of the discovery of the Gunpowder Plot -LRB- to which the line , `` Frustrate their knavish tricks , '' is said especially to allude -RRB- , the world may never know .

		Luckily there will never be any question as to the origin of the lines whose author had his praises so mem - orably sung by one of ' ' the boys ' ' at the thir - tieth anniversary supper of his college class , the famous Harvard
' 29	DATE	, `` And there 's a nice youngster of excellent pith , - Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith ; But he shouted a song for the brave and the free , Just read on his medal , ' My country , of thee ! ' ''

		AN ORTHOGRAPHIC PUZZLE confronts the spelling-reformers in the now daily and hourly used word corps .

		The `` Simplified Spelling Bulletin '' devotes more than a page to discussing the anomalies and ambiguities for which this unsimplifiable French word has been responsible .

		`` But we must say core and spel it corps , '' says the writer , though '' `` the normal English spelling of corps is in fact core , or , if one so pronounces it , cor . ''

		Apparently the `` Bulletin '' shrinks from the responsibility of advocating a phonetic spell - ing of the word ; even in its pages the `` army core '' would cut a rather queer figure .

		In this connection one is reminded of another military term that may some day give a little trouble to the reformers , if it has not already done so .

		Lieutenant can hardly be said to offer a perfect example of phonetic spelling even to an American , far less to an English - man , who customarily pronounces the word , leftenant .

		The American and the English simplifiers ought to get together and agree on an international spelling and pronunciation of this very common word .

		And while they are about it , they might also fix upon an inter - national accent of still another military term , subaltern , which is emphasized on the penult in this country and on the antepenult in
England	LOCATION	.

		When the war is over and the things that military language stands for cease to be of an importance so vastly superior to that of the language itself , perhaps the world will have leisure to amuse itself with such questions as these .

		BOOK-HUNGER IN THE IRON RANGE OP MIN - NESOTA evinces itself in the eager use that the
Iron Rangers	ORGANIZATION	make of any new public library that opens to them its literary treasures .

		From the mining town of Chisholm there comes , through the columns of the `` Library News and Notes '' of the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, this item of cheering intelligence : `` It would do
Mary Antin	PERSON	's heart good if she could visit the libraries on the
Iron Range	ORGANIZATION	and see the use which the immigrants are making of these splendid in - stitutions .

		In the six weeks from the opening of the library ,
May 15th	DATE	to the end of
June	DATE	, 935 children and 504 adults were registered , and
5609	DATE	volumes were circulated .

		During
July	DATE	164 additional registrations were made , and the circulation was
3336	DATE	volumes .

		Spe - cial days in the week are assigned to the children from various locations , in order to distribute the work evenly .

		The children may exchange books any day , but there is music for them on these special days , and a story hour .

		There are victrola concerts every Sun - day afternoon , in which the music of many nations is used .

		Sometimes selections from an opera are given , and the story of the opera is told . ' '

		These frequent reports of the immi - grant children 's enthusiastic and intelligent use of their library privileges in `` the prom - ised land '' make a native reader almost ashamed of the comparative lack of ardor in this respect on the part of some of our young people of good old American stock .

		PREJUDICES OF JUVENILE READERS make themselves known in more or less amusing ways to every children 's librarian with ears to hear the freely offered comments of the young book-borrowers .

		For example , in the juvenile department of the
St. Louis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	the following dialogue , as recorded by Miss
Effie L. Power	PERSON	in ' ' How the Children of a Great City Get Their Books , ' ' varied the day 's routine not long ago .

		`` Missus , how much will I have to pay if I keep my book till
Monday	DATE	? ''

		asked a small voice over the receiving desk of a city library .

		The at - tendant looked up eagerly to meet the famil - 446 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Why ,

		What has hap - pened ? ''

		`` Nothin ' , '' was the reply , while the attendant fingered the book cards in the tray before her .

		`` Your book is due to-day , but you have an hour 's time before the library closes .

		Why do n't you go home and get it ? ''

		* ' Can ` t , ' ' said
Joe	PERSON	. ' '

		Why can ' t you ? ' '

		per - sisted the attendant . ''

		'Cause , '' continued
Joe	PERSON	, `` I 'll get a bath if I do . ''

		Though not exactly an expression of his literary likings or dislikings ,
Joe	PERSON	's words deserve a place in the `` lighter vein '' of librariana .

		`` A JOURNAL OF OPINION '' appears as the sub-title on the opening page of the new weekly periodical just started in
New York	LOCATION	under the editorship of Mr.
Herbert Croly	PERSON	and an able staff of young writers , and with the promising name , `` The New Republic '' -LRB- without apologies or acknowledgments to Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The editor explains , speaking as if such an undertaking were entirely novel and quite unprecedented , that his enterprise `` is an attempt to find national audience for a journal of interpretation and opinion . ''

		That is , of course , what every serious-minded weekly review of the world 's doings has hoped to do .

		It may be that `` The New Republic '' will succeed to a degree which has not hith - erto been achieved in
America	LOCATION	.

		We have already expressed the hope that it will .

		It does seem that there is promise in the first numbers of this paper of a more hospitable welcome to the man with an idea especially a man with an idea about politics or education which can be set down in fifteen hundred words than it is our American journalistic -RRB- custom to offer .

		... A NOVEL BOOK-ADVERTISEMENT is brought to the attention of readers of a prominent news - paper by an observant correspondent .

		In the trade catalogue of a well-known
London	LOCATION	pub - lisher , he says , appears the following note on a certain useful work , which is named at the end . ' '

		If , as perhaps may be , the
Mailed Fist of Prusso-Nietzschian Immoralism	ORGANIZATION	has its knuckles smashed for ever by the strong hand of the free peoples of
Europe	LOCATION	-LRB- y compris les Busses -RRB- , and its Shining
Armour	PERSON	labeled in a corner of life 's great Museum , it will not be forgotten that one organizer of victory was free speech .

		Of that some pure samples , amid whatever dross and tinsel , may be found throughout the generations in the pages of
Hansard	ORGANIZATION	's Debates . ''

		Few are the books now on the market that may not be shown by an ingenious advertisement-writer to have some bearing on the present all-absorbing
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean event .

		DETERRENTS TO WOULD-BE LIBRARIANS are often better-advised than encouragements .

		Librarianship is no bed of roses .

		In the Wis - consin `` Library Bulletin '' are printed sundry wise remarks on this subject ; for example : `` The important thing to bear in mind in se - lecting apprentices is that it is much easier to get an assistant than to get rid of one .

		Any applicant who can be deterred by a recital of the difficulties with which her path will be -LSB- be -RSB- set and the small compensation that will be hers , even should she continue to walk therein ... should be spared no detail . ''

		Another rather wise utterance on the same page is this : ' ' An informal oral examination to test the quickness of thought is often illu - minating , and an excellent test of an examina - tion is to take it oneself . ''

		Best of all is the discovery made in a footnote that this shrewdly practical advice is from a library - school graduation thesis not from the accu - mulated wisdom of an experienced librarian .

		In your '' Casual Comment '' of

		But the bards themselves , from Chaucer to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and

		The suggestion of '' flower '' for '' fly '' in

		Take now this passage in the '' Lines Left on a Seat in a Yew-tree '' : '' Know that ... he who feels contempt For any living thing , hath faculties Which he hath never used : that thought with him Is in its infancy . ''


Rousseau	PERSON	had already said -LRB- in '' Emile '' -RRB- , '' Speak of the human race with emotion , even with pity never with contempt . ''

		What could be humaner , wiser , more lucid ?

		But when

		THE IKVBNTOR OF THE TELEGRAPH .

		* Familiar though the name of
Samuel F. B. Morse	PERSON	is to all intelligent persons , few are wont to think of him as anything more than an inventor , a scientist absorbed in the study of electro-magnetism , and the victim of some of the usual hardships and injustices that fall to the lot of almost every great inventive genius .

		The accounts of the man hitherto published have naturally dealt especially and often exclusively with
Morse	PERSON	the inventor , to the neglect of Morse the painter , the sculptor , and the great-hearted , large-minded human being .

		Yet his life-course of fourscore years was half run before he turned his attention , as if by accident , to the field of labor in which he was to win his peculiar distinction in the eyes of the world .

		This division of his life into two equal parts is indicated to the eye by the similar division of his ample biog - raphy , now completed by his son , into two nearly equal volumes ; and as it is the later
Morse	PERSON	who is already best known to us , it may be well here to give chief attention to the less familiar and equally interesting earlier
Morse	PERSON	as we find him self-portrayed in his letters and journals , for the most part hitherto un - published .

		As will appear at once to any reader , and as
Morse	ORGANIZATION	's son says of him at the outset , '' his versatility and abounding vitality were as - tounding .

		He would have been an eminent man in his day had he never invented the telegraph ; but it is of absorbing interest , in following his career , to note how he was forced to give up one ambition after another , to suffer blow after blow which would have overwhelmed a man of less indomitable perseverance , until all his great energies were im - pelled into the one channel which ultimately led to undying fame . ''

		Probably it was this very versatility and abounding vitality that gave to the first years of young
Morse	ORGANIZATION	's college course at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	a com - plexion not wholly satisfactory to his parents , the Rev.
Jedediah Morse	PERSON	of
Charlestown	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and his good wife ,
Elizabeth Ann Breese	PERSON	-LRB- granddaughter , by the way , of President
Samuel Finley	PERSON	of Princeton Col - lege -RRB- .

		Avid of pleasure , like any healthy boy of his age , the lad seems to have spent more of his time and substance in non-academic pursuits than was thought wise by those enti - tled to pronounce judgment , and it is certain *

		that he fitted so imperfectly into the college machinery that he slipped a cog and dropped into the class succeeding that with which he had entered .

		Moreover , he received no ap - pointment at graduation .

		His extraordinary power of application and tenacity of purpose developed later .

		As he was but fourteen years old when he entered
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1805	DATE	, and but nineteen when he received his bachelor 's degree , there is no cause for surprise at his flabbiness of mental texture when he rejoined his family at
Charlestown	LOCATION	and , obedient to his parents ' wishes , consented to begin life as a bookseller 's apprentice at a salary of
four hundred dollars	MONEY	a year .

		Already , however , he had begun to paint , and had gained enough proficiency in portraiture to secure a number of sitters at
five dollars	MONEY	for a miniature on ivory , or one dollar for a simple profile ; and before many months had passed his father found him so absorbed in art at the expense of commerce that it was wisely decided to oppose no longer the bent of his genius , and plans were made for him to accompany Wash - ington
Allston	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	and there pursue his painting under the best available instruc - tion .

		The aged but still active
Benjamin West	LOCATION	's kindly reception and cordial encour - agement of his young compatriot were of great assistance to him ; and he visited
Copley	LOCATION	, whom he found friendly but not exactly in - spiring in the sad decline of his powers .

		Admitted to the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	on the strength of a drawing from the
Laocoon	LOCATION	, he devoted his days to painting at home with his room-mate ,
Charles R. Leslie	PERSON	, of subsequent fame as an American artist , and his evenings to drawing at the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		From a letter of this golden period -LRB- the autumn of
1811	DATE	-RRB- we quote a significant passage . ''

		I was astonished to find such a difference in the encouragement of art between this country and
America	LOCATION	.

		In
America	LOCATION	it seemed to lie neglected and only thought to be an employment suited to a lower class of people ; but here it is the constant subject of conversation , and the exhibitions of the several painters are fashionable resorts .

		No per - son is esteemed accomplished or well educated un - less he possesses almost an enthusiastic love for paintings .

		To possess a gallery of pictures is the pride of every nobleman , and they seem to vie with each other in possessing the most choice and most numerous collection . ''

		Though
Morse	PERSON	's English sojourn included the years of our last war with the mother country , and though he was intensely and at times outspokenly patriotic , he seems to have met with no serious unpleasantness arising from his nationality , and , as the following quotation shows , his proficiency in art did not fail of recognition .

		A large painting , `` The 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	Dying Hercules , '' had been sent by him to the
Royal Academy Exhibition	ORGANIZATION	at
Somerset House	ORGANIZATION	, and he had also made a clay model of the figure to help him in his work with the brush .

		He writes home in
June , 1813	DATE	: '' I send by this opportunity -LRB- Mr.
Elisha	PERSON	God - dard -RRB- the little cast of the Hercules which ob - tained the prize this year at the
Adelphi	LOCATION	, and also the gold medal , which was the premium presented to me , before a large assembly of the nobility and gentry of the country , by the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	, who also paid me a handsome compliment at the same time .

		There were present Lord
Percy	PERSON	, the
Margravine of Anspach	ORGANIZATION	, the Turkish , Sardinian , and Russian Ambassadors , who were pointed out to me , and many noblemen whom I do not now recollect .

		My great picture also has not only been received at the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	, but has one of the finest places in the rooms .

		It has been spoken of in the papers , which you must know is considered a great compliment ; for a young artist , unless extraordinary , is seldom or never mentioned till he has exhibited several times .

		They not only praise me , but place my picture among the most attrac - tive in the exhibition .

		This I know will give you pleasure . ''

		These auspicious beginnings might have been expected to lead on to those supreme achieve - ments in art that the young painter avowedly aspired to , as appears from a letter to his parents : `` My ambition is to be among those who shall revive the splendor of the fifteenth century ; to rival the genius of a
Raphael	ORGANIZATION	, a
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, or a Titian ; my ambition is to be enlisted in the constellation of genius now rising in this country ; I wish to shine , not by a light borrowed from them , but to strive to shine the brightest . ''

		Perhaps if his hopes had been more modest he might have continued to find his happiness and his welfare in the practice of his art .

		No reason is apparent why he should not have attained a success considerably above the av - erage ; but where the loss to art has been so immeasurably exceeded by the gain to science , one is little inclined to waste time in bewail - ing the inconstancy that proved a blessing to civilization .

		The rich record of
Morse	ORGANIZATION	's pur - suit of his earlier calling , of his studies and travels , the canvases that came from his brush , and the lectures he was invited to deliver as a master in his domain , will be found in the first volume of the biography .

		Volume two , as above indicated , makes the reader acquainted with
Morse	PERSON	the inventor , the eager pursuer through innumerable diffi - culties and delays of an idea , a startling sug - gestion , a dazzling possibility , that flashed into his mind one evening at dinner on the packet - ship `` Sully '' as he was returning home from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It was in the
autumn of 1832	DATE	, but as the traveller did not on this voyage , as on previous ones , keep a careful diary , the exact date and circumstances can not be given .

		The story , no longer a new one , as told by his son is as follows : '' One night at the dinner-table the conversation chanced upon the subject of electro-magnetism , and Dr.
Jackson	PERSON	described some of the more recent discoveries of European scientists the length of wire in the coil of a magnet , the fact that elec - tricity passed instantaneously through any known length of wire , and that its presence could be ob - served at any part of the line by breaking the circuit .

		Morse was , naturally , much interested , and it was then that the inspiration , which had lain dormant in his brain for many years , sud - denly came to him , and he said : ' If the presence of electricity can be made visible in any part of the circuit , I see no reason why intelligence may not be transmitted instantaneously by electricity . ' ''

		No one was startled by the suggestion , its sig - nificance being doubtless beyond the grasp of the average man ; but the one who made it appreciated its meaning and thenceforth de - voted himself to the putting of his thought into a visible form .

		What sacrifices he was willing to make for the sake of that elusive end , appear from his own subsequent confes - sions .

		He says , for instance : '' Up to the
autumn of 1837	DATE	my telegraphic ap - paratus existed in so rude a form that I felt a reluctance to have it seen .

		My means were very limited so limited as to preclude the possibility of constructing an apparatus of such mechanical finish as to warrant my success in venturing upon its public exhibition .

		I had no wish to expose to ridicule the representative of so many hours of laborious thought .

		Prior to the
summer of 1837	DATE	, at which time Mr.
Alfred Vail	PERSON	's attention became attracted to my telegraph , I depended upon my pencil for subsistence .

		Indeed , so straitened were my circumstances that , in order to save time to carry out my invention and to economize my scanty means , I had for months lodged and eaten in my studio , procuring my food in small quanti - ties from some grocery , and preparing it myself .

		To conceal from my friends the stinted manner in which I lived , I was in the habit of bringing my food to my room in the evenings , and this was my mode of life for many years . ''

		Credit for the discovery of the principle of multiple telegraphy is claimed for
Morse	PERSON	by his son , and a letter of the inventor 's written in
1842	DATE	is published by him for the first time in proof of the claim .

		Why this dis - covery should have been lost sight of is some - what of a mystery .

		It was fully
ten years later	DATE	that the same discovery was again made and put to use by others .

		Wireless telegraphy is hinted at in the above-named letter , and credit has been accorded to
Morse	ORGANIZATION	.

		This full and apparently faithful biog - raphy from an admiring and affectionate son 's hand contains much more of the man
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 449 Morse than has here been even faintly indi - cated .

		Of course it will be accepted as the final and authoritative life of the inventor , as it is also one of the most notable biographies of the year .

		As announced on the title-page , it is fully and most interestingly illustrated .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		A BRAZILIAN JOURXEY .

		* When Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	went to
Africa	LOCATION	, there were many who doubted the sincerity of his scientific aims .

		Here is a man , some peo - ple said , who wants to fight and to kill ; and since we are not engaged in war , he will kill the large animals of
Africa	LOCATION	, which are suffi - ciently formidable to be interesting .

		There was enough truth in this estimate to make it plausible , but it was crude and unjust .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	is not a laboratory naturalist .

		There -RRB- is apparently no reason to suppose that he would ever have the patience or the interest in minute details to write a technical scientific monograph , or carry out a series of experi - ments .

		Love of adventure , delight in the struggle for existence , energy , persistence all these and kindred qualities do not neces - sarily or usually make a scientific man , but they are invaluable for certain kinds of scien - tific work .

		The opponents of militarism may be inclined , at the present time , to regard Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as a rather dangerous individual ; but if they will read the account of his jour - ney through
Brazil	LOCATION	, they will find therein much cause for satisfaction .

		Here we find all those robust qualities , which have in different ages wrought so much good and ill to mankind , thrown whole-heartedly into the business of scientific exploration .

		Here is one of the '' substitutes for war , '' which ``
William James	PERSON	, reasoning as a psychologist , felt to be neces - sary .

		There are many such substitutes , but they must be sought out and followed up , or there will be a genuine danger that with the progress of civilization some of the more valu - able human qualities will tend to atrophy from disuse .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, in his own per - son -LRB- and from statements he has published one is justified in thinking he would agree to this -RRB- , illustrates the transition from the more primitive hunting and fighting instincts to the condition in which those same instincts are trained to serve broadly human ends .

		Even his militarism , which some of us can not ap - prove , has taken on a cosmopolitan aspect , and looks -LRB- whether correctly or not -RRB- toward the welfare of the whole world .

		Thus , in the * THROUGH THE BRAZILIAN WILDERNESS .

		future , one feels that Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	will stand out as a great typical figure , the herald , per - haps , of some things which he would himself scarcely approve .

		Looking for a psychological parallel , one thinks of Luther .

		Few people are aware of the really note - worthy zoological discoveries made by Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	and his associates on their African journey .

		The collection at the
National Mu	ORGANIZATION	- seum is truly wonderful , and simply as an exhibit has surprised many , including a mud - dle-headed congressman who was reported as saying that he would never vote for appropria - tions for the Museum , as the whole thing was evidently an advertisement for Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, whom he hated !

		Specialists in zoology know , however , that on the strictly scientific side our knowledge of African mammals and birds has been greatly increased .

		The Brazilian expedi - tion will assuredly yield like results , when the two thousand five hundred birds , five hundred mammals , and other materials have been care - fully investigated .

		This great number of specimens suggests indiscriminate slaughter , but as the narrative shows , it is a carefully selected series , no animals or birds being killed unless required for scientific study or for food , or because they were pests .

		There was no careless or wanton shooting .

		So short a time has elapsed between the completion of the journey and the publication of the book , that there has been no opportunity to prepare a summary of the zoological discoveries ; but it is to be hoped that an appendix will be added to a subsequent edition .

		On the other hand , as every one knows , we are given full details about the large river , to be called
Rio Teodoro	PERSON	, for the first time descended and mapped .

		The reviewer recalls an occasion when the veteran explorer of
Brazil	LOCATION	, the late
A. R. Wallace	PERSON	, took out a map , and running his finger over this very region , remarked that there still remained notable geographical work for any able man .

		He marvelled that in the many years since he visited the country , so little scientific work had been done in the upper
Amazon	LOCATION	valley , con - sidering the vast opportunities offered .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's narrative shows how difficult and dangerous the work of exploration in these regions may be , but at the same time how much is possible , given energy and skill , with only moderate time and means .

		It is also clearly indicated that most interesting and valuable results await a resident naturalist -LRB- even though resident for only a short time -RRB- in these regions quite without any exceptional hazards .

		The Brazilian expedition is officially to be known as the `` Expedicao
Scientifica Roose	PERSON	- velt-Rondon , '' as it was designated by the 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE
Brazilian Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was due to Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	's initiative , but he himself continu - ally insists on the dominant part played by his associate , the Brazilian Colonel
Rondon	PERSON	, and on the zoological work of Messrs.
Cherrie	PERSON	and
Miller	PERSON	, of the
American Museum of Natural History	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Whenever a group of men engage in exploration , it is difficult and unnecessary to divide the credit , which largely belongs to the group rather than to individuals .

		In official documents the work of associates and subordi - nates is not always recognized , but happily there is an increasing tendency to do full jus - tice to all , and it must be said that in the in - stance now before us we can only fear that the author has not adequately represented his own services .

		The book is readable and interesting from beginning to end .

		It has just the right admix - ture of narrative , observation , and reflection .

		It not only represents the reactions and im - pressions of an exceptionally able and well - trained mind , but is the work of a superman , in the sense that it embodies the combined thought of the members of the expedition , who were so variously skilled in different ways .

		There is I think too much repetition of state - ments , but even this may have a pedagogical justification .

		In another edition , one would like to see added a few footnotes , bringing out more clearly the zoological relationships of certain of the animals .

		Thus there are many refer - ences to the fishes , but the reader is left uncer - tain how these are related to each other and to fishes of other countries .

		The very interesting character of the South American fish-fauna could be explained , in its broader outlines , in a small space .

WALPOLE	LOCATION	'S `` DEAR BOTH . ''

		* In
1852	DATE	died two remarkable women , sis - ters , both well along toward their ninetieth year .

		So closely had Mary and
Agnes Berry	PERSON	been associated for more than half a century with the literature and society of
England	LOCATION	and the Continent , that their loss was widely regretted .

		Mary , the elder , had edited the works of
Horace Walpole	PERSON	and engaged in other literary enterprises ; but in their own time , as now , the two were better known for their personality than for anything they pro- duced .

		good society , set about accomplishing that end by giving him a letter of introduction to the sisters .


Kate Perry	PERSON	expressed the general feeling when she wrote , after their death : `` There is no salon now to compare with that of the Miss Berrys . ''

		In
1865	DATE	Lady
Theresa Lewis	PERSON	published three volumes of extracts from
Mary Berry	ORGANIZATION	's letters and correspondence .

		Mr.
Melville	PERSON	now supplements these with a book of 448 pages , well printed , freely illustrated , and composed almost wholly of new material .

		He gives
Agnes Berry	PERSON	an increased prominence , though he reserves the chief role for
Mary	ORGANIZATION	.

		The cor - respondence of the Hon. Mrs.
Darner	PERSON	and of General
O'Hara	PERSON	with the latter , is the best and most readable part of the new volume .

		It may be as well to comment at once upon Mr.
Melville	PERSON	's work and then devote our at - tention to the
Misses Berry	ORGANIZATION	themselves .

		Mr.
Melville	PERSON	relies mainly upon the correspon - dence to carry on the story , though he sup - plies narrative when needed , and tacks on the - necessary footnotes .

		This part of his task is , in general , well performed .

		There are repeti - tions , however , and other signs of haste , as when
Bertie Greathead	PERSON	is told about twice - within a few pages -LRB- 121 and 125 -RRB- and made bi-sexual .

		A more difficult problem was to - decide what letters should be included .

		Here - Mr.
Melville	PERSON	was between the devil and the deep sea .

		If he omitted materials made acces - sible already by Lady
Theresa Lewis	PERSON	or in the correspondence of
Horace Walpole	LOCATION	, he would ' have only left-overs to choose from .

		If he inserted them , he could not cry , `` hitherto unpublished . ''

		He adopted the first of these alternatives , wrongly we think .

		Readers are not usually able or , if able , willing to piece out their knowledge from other publica - tions .

		Moreover , the book is padded : some of the letters from people of distinction are so formal as to be of little consequence , while - many from less conspicuous people are tire - some .

		Finally , there are almost no direct utterances from
Walpole Walpole	LOCATION	, whose connection with the sisters remains the most interesting thing about them .

		The outward life of the sisters was marked by few striking events .

		Their mother died early and they were left to the care of an improvident , if kindly , father whose annuity , though moderate , should have enabled him to lay something by for them .

		They early had ' the advantage of travel , an advantage they continued to enjoy through life .

		In
1788	DATE	, while temporarily resident at
Twickenham	LOCATION	, they became acquainted with
Walpole	LOCATION	, then in his old days .

		Two years later , under his : persuasions , they established themselves at
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 451 Little Strawberry Hill .

		When he died , in
1797	DATE	, he left them the house , together with a `` bequest in money .

		It was here and in Lon - don , chiefly , that their days were spent .

		The friendship with
Walpole	LOCATION	had given them such prominence that they were thrown thereafter with the most distinguished people .

		To study their lives , indeed , is to see familiarly many of the celebrities of the age .

		Not all of their importance was borrowed , however .

		When
Walpole	LOCATION	first met them , he described them thus : '' They are ... the best-informed and the most perfect creatures I ever saw at their age .

		They are exceedingly sensible , entirely natural and un - affected , frank , and being qualified to talk on any subject , nothing is so easy and agreeable as their conversation , nor more apposite than their answers and observations .

		The eldest , I discovered by chance , understands Latin , and is a perfect French - woman in her language .

		The younger draws charmingly ... They are of pleasing figures ;
Mary	PERSON	, the eldest , sweet , with fine dark eyes , that are very lively when she speaks , with a symmetry of face that is the more interesting from being pale ;
Agnes	PERSON	, the younger , has an agreeable sensi - ble countenance , hardly to be called handsome , but .

		almost .

		She is less animated than
Mary	PERSON	, but seems , out of deference to her sister to speak seldomer , for they dote on each other , and
Mary	PERSON	is always prais - ing her sister 's talents .

		I must even tell you they dress within the bounds of fashion , though fash - ionably ; but without the excrescences and balconies with which modern hoydens overwhelm and barri - cade their persons .

		In short , good sense , informa - tion , simplicity , and ease characterize the
Berrys	LOCATION	; and this is not particularly mine , who am apt to be prejudiced , but the universal voice of all who know them . ''

		The prim , old-time pictures of the sisters , and the quiet demeanor of which we hear so much , might incline us to think them ' ' goody - goody . ' '

		They had too much force to be that .

		Even
Agnes	PERSON	, self-effacing , submissive it would seem in matters of love , was far from weak .

		She was one of those persons who exercise a tact so perfect that it seems effortless until we stop to realize the strength of character behind it .

		Thackeray thought her the more naturally gifted of the two .

		However that may be , the qualities of Mary were more pro- nounced .

		She had a keen eye for the faults of others .

		She wrote of the Duke of Welling - ton : '' The simplicity and frankness of his manners , and the way in which he speaks of public affairs are really those of a great man : altho ' talking of the allied sovereigns , their views , etc. , etc. , he says we found out so and so , we intend such and such things , quite as treating de Couronne a Couronne . ''

		She was potentially prankish .

		Here is the account in her journal of her presentation to the Princess of Wales : '' I do n't think she was taken with me , as she saw , when I did not suppose she did , the moue which I made to Lady
Sheffield	PERSON	when she proposed it to me ... which I changed for a proper Court face the moment I saw her looking , and the thing inevitable . ''

		Happily the Princess forgave the indiscretion , and often invited the sisters to
Kensington Palace	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sometimes
Mary	PERSON	was betrayed into an indiscretion by pique .

		When her one acted play -LRB- produced anonymously -RRB- failed on the stage , she published it with an advertise - ment which withheld her own name but dragged in that of
Walpole	LOCATION	.

		She could be resentful too .

		Cadaverous
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	liked her little and called on her but once a year on the day they shared perforce , as they chanced to be precisely of an age . ' '

		Miss Berry and I are twins , '' he remarked to a friend ; `` I have just been to see how she wears ; this is her and my birthday . ''

		Her comment was : `` When I heard this , I went to my looking-glass to see if it reflected such a death 's - head as his . ''

		Despite the belief that long was current ,
Walpole	LOCATION	did not propose to
Mary Berry	PERSON	.

		His affection for her was genuine , however .

		To Agnes he was less ardently attached , but he took care to include `` wife the second '' in the matrimonial alliance he pretended to have formed .

		He referred to himself as an old '' fondle - wife , '' to them as `` my beloved spouses , '' '' twin - wives , '' `` dear both . ''

		The playful tone of his communications to them is manifest from the first . ' '

		I am afraid of pro- testing how much I delight in your society , lest I should seem to affect being gallant , ' ' he wrote in
1789	DATE	; ' ' but if two negatives make an affirmative , why may not two ridicules com - pose one piece of sense ?

		and therefore , as I am in love with you both , I trust it is a proof of the good sense of your devoted H. Wal - pole . ' '

		While we are sent elsewhere for these letters of
Walpole	LOCATION	, we are grateful to Mr.
Melville	PERSON	for the fresh glimpses he gives of the man 's devotion through the ample correspon - dence of the Hon. Mrs.
Darner	PERSON	with
Mary Berry	PERSON	.

		Here we see an old man gay with the sprightliness of youth yet peevish with the impatience of age .

		He is anxious when the post brings him no word , is so elated with the letters which come that he must read them forthwith to Mrs.
Darner	PERSON	, is curiously indif - ferent to the letters sent to her , and turns up his nose at
Madame d' Albany	ORGANIZATION	, will never for - give her in fact , for not recognizing immedi - ately the name of
Mary Berry	PERSON	, though she had heard it before as
Mary Barry	PERSON	.

		452 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	Walpole was in part responsible for the unhappy outcome of
Mary Berry	ORGANIZATION	's connection with General
Charles O'Hara	PERSON	.

		This officer had served with distinction in
America	LOCATION	until captured with
Cornwallis	PERSON	at
Yorktown	LOCATION	, and had since acquitted himself well in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He was a man of forceful and fascinating presence .

		To him
Mary Berry	PERSON	plighted her troth ; but she would not marry him at once for fear of hurting
Walpole	LOCATION	and of doing an injustice to her father and sister .

		An ap - pointment to the governorship of
Gibraltar	LOCATION	took him from her side .

		Under the wiles of less worthy women , his unstable nature re - pented very quickly of its former attachment .

		To his efforts to break the engagement in such a way as to imply that the fault lay with her , she replied spiritedly and yet with modera - tion .

		She never ceased to believe that the union which would have come under happier auspices `` would have called out all the powers of my mind and all the warmest feel - ings of my heart . ''

		When he died , a few years subsequent to the rupture , she sealed up her correspondence with him .

		In her old days she opened it again and recorded in a pathetic note her `` conviction that some feel - ings in some minds are indelible . ''

		GARLAND GREEVER .

		THE PATHFINDER . ''

		* Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	has entered into his sub - ject with enthusiasm .

		The frontier expe - riences of his own career give him a natural bent of sympathy toward a character like that of
John C. Fremont	ORGANIZATION	.

		In fact ,
Fremont	LOCATION	had in him powerful elements of attraction for Americans in general , and the mere fact that his hold on the public esteem was ever seriously shaken is enough to prove that some very powerful cause lay back of the change , whether just or unjust .

		The underlying motive in Mr.
Dellen	PERSON	- baugh 's book is to reverse the unfavorable ver - dict , and restore the admiration and respect for his hero which has always been the senti - ment of a few and was at one time that of the many .

		This result , however , he aims to secure not so much by a direct clash with opposing argument as by a lively presentation of Fre - mont 's varied and always interesting career .

		From the latter point of view , as a picture of western exploration more or less vitally con - nected with the logical rounding out of our national domain , the volume is the success *

		which the name of Dellenbaugh implies .

		It brings back in a very vivid way pictures of early western conditions which are more valu - able for study now than ever before , since we are far enough away from the reality to recog - nize and profit by the mistakes of our period of territorial expansion and not merely to revel in its material gains .

		But when we come to the other question , Has Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	reversed the verdict of history as to the serious short-comings of Fre - mont ?

		we are forced to say that the book is unconvincing .

		As an explorer , after years of experience and many brilliant achievements to his credit , he was capable of surprising blun - ders of judgment even in that field .

		One can - not read Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	's own account of the expedition of the winter of 1848-9 , with its story of disaster and death hardly sur - passed outside the field of polar catastrophes , and not feel that
Fremont	LOCATION	was foolhardy to the verge of criminality .

		He was warned in
November	DATE	, before entering the mountains , that the snow was deeper than ever before known , by either whites or Indians , and he knew that if he got safely over the crests he would pass not into a mild , inhabited land where recuper - ation would be easy , but into `` an elevated labyrinth of plateaus , canyons and more mountains , unpeopled and trackless . ' '

		to quote the author 's own description .

		At Pueblo ,
Bill Williams	PERSON	, an experienced mountaineer , ad - vised strongly against the undertaking , but
Fremont	LOCATION	was unshakable and
Williams	PERSON	was finally persuaded to go along as leader .

		Fre - mont subsequently charged the disaster to faulty guidance on
Williams	ORGANIZATION	's part , and this explanation appears in no less an authority than the new Encyclopaedia Britannica , but Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	's sense of justice will not al - low him to clear
Fremont	LOCATION	at the expense of un - merited reproach upon
Williams	ORGANIZATION	.

		``
Williams	PERSON	led them from Pueblo ,
Colorado	LOCATION	, by a fairly direct road to the turning-back point , on the very line which
Fremont	LOCATION	had proposed to follow . ''

		It was only an especially fatal case of that lack of balanced judgment and excess of egotism which marred
Fremont	LOCATION	's career at so many other points as well .

		The author does not go deeply into his Civil War career , but endeavors so far as possible to clear him of reproach in the matters which led first to his removal from his command in Mis - souri and later to his entire separation from the army .

		The endeavor is unsuccessful .

		Fremont confused the situation in the public mind by his bold bid for the admiration of the more advanced anti-slavery advocates , but even that could not cover up the utter admin - istrative disorder in his department .

		If , as
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 453 Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	asserts , he found confusion there when he assumed command , it is none the less in evidence that every week of his command made it confusion worse confounded .

		If one wants an effective presentation of the case in brief , let him turn to Chapters
XXIII	PERSON	.

		and XXIV .

		of the fourth volume of Nicolay and Hay 's book on
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		The second of these chapters deals conclusively also with
Fremont	LOCATION	's
Missouri Emancipation Proclama	LOCATION	- tion , the best that can be said for which is only that it showed its author 's heart to be in the right place so far as regards the institu - tion of slavery .

		That each commander in the field should have the right to determine the final status of human beings without consulta - tion with the President and without regard to an act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	just passed , is inadmissible on any other basis than that of administrative anarchy .

		The truth is that
Fremont	LOCATION	's mind M r as not built on lines of law and order .

		The difficulties that grew out of this fact in his public life were closely paralleled in the con - fusion of his more strictly personal affairs , especially the famous Mariposa land grants .

		It is true that there is a disposition to scoff at the mind that allows itself to run in channels of law and order as stupidly bromidical , and perhaps
Fremont	LOCATION	may yet be lifted out of reproach as a kind of business and official cubist or vorticist , born out of due time .

		But so long as generally accepted standards of judgment and conduct remain , it is likely to remain the verdict of the careful reader that
Fremont	LOCATION	's career shows a disfiguring propor - tion of unwise conduct , based on undisciplined judgment .

		Mr.
Dellenbaugh	PERSON	's suggestion that he was the victim of West Point jealousy can - not remove the positive and ample evidence of his own shortcomings , nor is it fortified by any positive proof that such jealousy was actually at work .

PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	.

		* We like to think of
America	LOCATION	as a country that offers a career to talent .

		All good Amer - icans used to persuade themselves that we had actually realized that noble ideal .

		But there are now plenty of cavillers ready to dispute the point , and so it will be safer to discrimi - nate .

		If we vary the formula a bit , and say that we in
America	LOCATION	have been careful not to close the door on financial talent , we shall not find many to quarrel with us : for our world of business has been , up to now , a singularly open world , easy of access on certain terms .

		* OUR
PHILADELPHIA	LOCATION	.

		Described by
Elizabeth Robins	PERSON	Pen - nell and illustrated with one hundred and five lithographs by
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	.


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This has not , of course , been the fruit of any of the political theories embodied in our constitution .

		We are natural pragmatists , our business men most of all .

		It is simply the result of our unique fitness for business and of the complete seriousness with which we take it .

		The American knows his world so thoroughly that he has been able to enter into its possession without petty jealousy or any of the exclusiveness that springs from a whole - some fear of competition .

		He has welcomed suggestions from whatever source , confident that his knowledge would enable him to sepa - rate the wheat from the chaff .

		He has been willing to reward the possessor of '' ideas '' with the best gifts at his command , and the re - sult of this hospitable attitude has been that the stock of financial talent in Wall Street has been constantly renewed from without .

		But talent is not to be had on easy terms ; it drives a hard bargain .

		It asks for nothing less than complete recognition , and , in the face of this demand , `` society '' here has been usually pliant .

		It has , indeed , accommodated itself to the requirements of business : so that the man without ancestors who has contrived to make himself indispensable to Wall Street has , on the whole , had a cordial welcome in
Fifth Avenue	LOCATION	as well .

		In response to this hard necessity of an industrial civilization , our aristocratic stock has undergone a free renewal from the social
Hinterland	LOCATION	, as any one at all familiar with life in
New York	LOCATION	can testify .

		This is not to deny that we have ever been ancestor-worshippers .

		Ancestor-worship has appeared among us , but it took shallow root and has always been looked at askance as an exotic .

		Our industrial civilization did not afford a generous soil for so delicate a growth , and the rage for its cultivation has already sensibly declined .

		So true is this that we younger Americans can study that transient phase of our national spirit best in the me - moirs of the last generation or in porten - tously solemn books on social history .

		Even in the older cities of the
East	LOCATION	, where an old tradition furnished the best soil for ancestor-worship , it was unevenly cultivated .

		New Yorkers , with their eyes ever fixed on the main chance , were not to be drawn aside from the chief end of man the pursuit of money to indulge in what was , after all , but a luxury of sentiment .

		Other cities , feeling less pres - sure from without , were less practical ; and of these one of the chief was
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		In
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, during the period immediately following the war , ancestor-worship flour - ished to an almost incredible extent ; and novelists , or other historians of our social life , 454 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	who happen to be curious as to this phenome - non , will find it in its purest form in Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's `` Our
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, '' a book of memories in which the author has collabo - rated with her gifted artist-husband .

		Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	, the daughter of an old
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia family , passed her early life in the sacred precincts of that district bounded by `` Chestnut , Walnut , Spruce , and Pine . ''

		Philadelphians of that day -LRB- the period after the war -RRB- did not absolutely pass from the cradle to the grave oblivious of the annoying fact that the real world was not also so cir - cumspectly bounded .

		No , they recognized an outer world , whose existence they were bound as humane persons to deplore .

		They had to regret that the opportunities for felicity , so generously and appropriately bestowed upon them by the mere accident of birth , were not shared by others .

		They satisfied their sense of duty in this respect , but they showed no laudable desire to extend the right of citizen - ship to the barbarian .

		They were a self - sustaining community of the elect ; they had been elected by their forefathers ; and fair - ness led them to conclude that if other mor - tals chose to be less careful in the selection of grandfathers -LRB- as the existence of other communities proved they did -RRB- why , it was after all their own fault .

		These Philadelphians , solid bankers and brokers , breakfasting solidly on scrapple and buckwheat cakes , wrapped in sober and digni - fied costumes , living with an elegant sim - plicity in their red brick houses with white stone trimmings , carefully scrutinizing their visiting lists and guarding themselves against the contamination of casual contacts , defile through Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's pages with a con - vincing air of life .

		They made of life an elaborate ritual rather than an art .

		Talent for them was limited to the talent of being ' ' well born . ' '

		If one happened to be a
Biddle	PERSON	, a
Cadwallader	PERSON	, an Ingersoll , or a
Wharton	LOCATION	, it was idle to look for giddier heights to scale ; one had already achieved the ultimate and might die with a dignified serenity .

		Even those who did not belong to the supreme clans might hope to be similarly happy in their taking off if only in the meantime they could obtain an invitation to the historic Assembly Ball the supreme test of status .

		Of this famous institution -LRB- for it really deserved to be called such -RRB- , Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	writes : '' I am not sure what was the number , what the quality of ancestors the Assembly exacted , but I know that it was as inexorable in its exactions as the
Council of Ten	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would have been easier for troops of camels to pass through the eye of a needle than for one Philadelphian north of Market street to get through the Assembly door .

		I am told that matters are worse to-day when
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia society has increased its numbers until new limits must be set to the Assembly lest it perish of its own unwieldiness .

		The applicants must pro- duce not only forefathers but fathers and mothers on the list , and the Philadelphian whose name was there more than a century and a half ago can not make good his rights if his parents neglected to establish theirs .

		And to be refused is not merely humiliation , but humiliation with
Philadelphia	LOCATION	for witness , and the misery and shame that are the burden of the humiliated . ''

		Drawing on the memories of her own girl - hood , Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	has given us a detailed and painstaking picture of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	interiors , with their ' ' rosewood and rep masterpieces of a deplorable period , '' their decorations of beaded cushions and worsted-work mats and tidies , with the family portraits on the walls and the inevitable engraving of
Gilbert Stu	PERSON	- art 's
Washington	LOCATION	over the dining-room man - telpiece .

		A fitting frame , surely , for these excellent Americans who inhabited a special milieu , and exhibited its excellence and its defects with an ideal fulness .

		Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	tells us how they dined -LRB- never vulgarly in hotels , as now -RRB- , how they entertained , how they worshipped ; what they thought of poli - tics , of social questions , of art and litera - ture , when they condescended to think of such things at all .

		And she is able to tell us of these things with an added intimacy pre - cisely because she has been able to accept the old
Philadelphia	LOCATION	view of life without chal - lenge .

		Its exclusiveness was to her but a natural safeguard of the dignified domes - ticity which Philadelphians had been able to achieve .

		Her criticisms she reserved for the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	of the present , a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	at last thoroughly Americanized , in which wealth is crowding out dignified poverty , in which aliens are driving the natives from the only quarter `` in which they choose to live , '' and efficiency is working to eliminate the favorite sons .

		Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	assures us that
Philadelphia	LOCATION	is a beautiful city , but her assurance persuades us of that fact far less directly than the hun - dred lithographs with which Mr.
Joseph Pen	PERSON	- nell illustrates the text .

		They are uniformly charming ; and because of them one feels safe in saying that no gift book of the season will be more alluring to the eye .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 455 RECENT FICTION .

		* Some one , having it in mind , perhaps , to controvert Zola 's propaganda of the scientific novel , has said that `` novels are only an ex - pression of temperament anyway . ''

		That is , of course , why we read them .

		We choose , not so much those novelists whose material , as such , interests us , or those whose ability ena - bles them to conform to our standards of artistry , as those novelists whose view of the world is sympathetic to our own .

		In some degree , we expect that a writer of fiction will express us .

		If he does not do this , most of us will not read him .

		That detached curiosity which leads readers through many pages which they do not approve , in spirit , is very rare .

		We say of a book , `` I like it , '' or , `` I do n't like it '' ; we do not say so often , `` It is well done , '' or , `` It is badly done . ''

		This is not merely because we are lazy and incom - petent ; it is because we are much more con - cerned about what we like than about what we might admire or respect .

		The charm of reading is not altogether different from the charm of conversing .

		Conversation among people who are perfectly agreed about life and conduct can hardly exist .

		But conversa - tion among people who differ about material matters is so uncommon that it is commonly called by another name .

		Conversation among people who differ about anything important is only achieved in highly sophisticated socie - ties and then only by virtue of a convention which demands that the subject about which there is a difference shall be ignored .

		So it is between novelists and readers .

		The novelist expresses his temperament in his work and those who are capable of liking that tempera - ment , that is to say , those who have a certain affinity for it , are capable of enjoying the expression of it .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	seems peculiarly a novelist who is read by disciples .

		Perhaps we should say - by many disciples .

		His popularity is negligi - ble to those who measure popularity by the hundred thousand copies sold .

		But is there a writer of English more read by young peo - ple with a turn for ideas ?

		A familiarity with Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is required among them .

		He is their honored prophet .

		For one thing , it is a groping soul that he has been exposing to us so industriously for the past decade or two .

		It differs from the souls of his readers chiefly in its power to record its gropings .

		another thing , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is not too far behind or ahead of his time .

		He thinks that women need , and ought to want , far greater freedom than our present customs allow them .

		But he has never asked us to admire a really in - transigent woman .

		He sympathizes with illicit love .

		But he is no Casanova .

		He is impatient of our educational methods .

		But he shares our faith in education .

		In a word , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	is aspiring rather than iconoclastic and unconventional rather than immoral .

		Finally and this may be one reason of his vogue and the reason of his failure to do all that has been expected of him he is not an artist of the severely disciplined sort .

		He has a splendid talent for setting down minor char - acters , the talent which he used to such pur - pose in `` Kipps '' and in `` The History of Mr.
Polly	PERSON	. ''

		If his skill in this respect , and his fund of material on which to exercise it , are less than
Dickens	PERSON	's were he has the advantage of a knowledge of many things that
Dickens	PERSON	never thought of and would not have written about if he had .

		He has , besides , this curiosity about what is going on in the world , from aeroplanes to advertising , which he has re - corded most successfully in `` Tono-Bungay '' and in `` The New Machiavelli '' and which has given him his place as a prophet to the younger generation .

		But the talent and the curiosity have never been fused .

		The result is a book like `` The Wife of Sir
Isaac Har	PERSON	- man . ''

		It is an immensely interesting book .

		It is not the novel we expect , that we demand .

		Sir
Isaac Harman	PERSON	gave his wife every luxury except liberty to do what she wanted .

		She interested herself in model tea shops .

		She made friends with an author such an au - thor !

		She played hob with Sir
Isaac	PERSON	's peace of mind .

		When Sir
Isaac	PERSON	died the author begged so hard for a kiss that she finally gave him one , or several , or half a dozen .

		It does not matter .

		Why could n't Lady
Harman	PERSON	have been something more than an ineffectual wraith ?

		Why could n't the novel have begun at the point where it left off ?

		Nobody knows except Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, and he is too busy writing to answer such questions .

		M.
Anatole France	LOCATION	is a connoisseur of iron - ies .

		His style , so graceful , so flexible , so equal , always , to the occasion , is almost too perfect .

		Its perfection is apparent even in English , at least in the generally excellent English of Mrs.
Wilfrid Jackson	PERSON	.

		M. Anatole
France	LOCATION	plays with ideas the most difficult as easily as old ladies gossip .

		And if he is occa - sionally too Gallic for the susceptibilities of those who read him in English , Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	has , we are informed , taken care to modify him .

		His attitude toward the world , so 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	gently skeptical , so appreciatively ironical , offends some and is enjoyed more than any - thing else in the world by a few : `` Amid the distractions of youth his faith re - mained intact , since he left it severely alone .

		He had never examined a single tenet .

		Nor had he enquired a whit more closely into the ideas of morality current in the grade of society to which he belonged .

		He took them just as they came .

		Thus in every situation that arose he cut an emi - nently respectable figure which he would have assuredly failed to do , had he been given to medi - tating on the foundations of morality . '' ''

		Thus the conversation went on until evening ; it was marked by obscenities that would have brought the blush I will not say to a cuirassier , for cuirassiers are frequently chaste , but even to a Parisienne . ''

		Those are typical paragraphs from our au - thor .

		Readers who like them will find others that they will like even better , since a para - graph which may be reproduced by itself is seldom so effective as one which is placed firmly in its context .

		Readers who find these paragraphs mildly distasteful will know bet - ter than to read
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, for they will find not less , but more , of the flavor which is his .

		The
Countess von Arnim	PERSON	, who is , we believe , the author of `` Elizabeth and Her German Garden '' and , therefore , the author of `` The Pastor 's Wife , '' writes in a vein curiously reminiscent of Mr. `` Wells .

		It is perhaps im - possible that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	should have conceived the final situation of `` The Pastor 's Wife , '' but not at all impossible that he should have conceived the opening one .

		The heroine of the story ,
Ingeborg	PERSON	, was the daughter of an English bishop a positively Wellsian bishop .

		She had her chance to go on a spree because a toothache proved beyond the skill of the local dentist and required to be treated in
London	LOCATION	.

		T , he master mechanic of the metrop - olis effected a cure at the first appointment and there was Ingeborg with 50 in her pocket and a fortnight on her hands .

		She chose a personally conducted tour on the Continent , met
Herr Dremmel	PERSON	, who was pastor to a small community in
East Prussia	LOCATION	and the most Ger - man of Germans , and returned home engaged to be married .

		There are tragic possibilities in what follows , possibilities that the
Countess von Arnim	PERSON	has suggested with a good deal of power , despite the insouciance of her manner and her humor .

		The effect at the end would have been less dubious than it is if she had been content to do one thing or the other .

		It requires genius happily to mix farce and com - edy and tragedy ; the
Countess von Arnim	PERSON	has only a most charming talent .

		She has .

		for instance , enjoyed immensely writing about the artist who endeavored to conduct a liaison with
Ingeborg	PERSON	, but she has made him too much a dunce , too unbelievably the naively philan - dering male .

		Her satire would be more pointed if her figure were less of an idiot .

		And yet , despite its uncertainties , its waver - ing , its faults of conception and construction , the book presents a point of view which has endeared the author 's books to many critical readers .

		What she says is sometimes acid and sometimes sweet , but it is always well said .

		Far more thrilling in reality than in the modest tone of its recital must have been the passage of the
Kolb	PERSON	brothers down the
Green	ORGANIZATION	and
Colorado	LOCATION	rivers , through the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	, to the Needles in south - ern
California	LOCATION	. ''

		Through the Grand Canyon from
Wyoming	LOCATION	to
Mexico	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- tells the story of the adventure , Mr.
Ellsworth L. Kolb	PERSON	being the narrator .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	contributes an opening word of commendation , both of the book and of the hardihood it so unassumingly por - trays .

		Many have attempted the perilous passage , , very few have come out alive .

		Major
Powell	PERSON	's re - port of the first exploration of the stupendous gorge was the pioneer account , in elaborate form , of its wonders ; and Mr.
F. S. Dellenbaugh	PERSON	after - ward described its majesty and romance .

		Mr.
Kolb	PERSON	's book is , therefore , the third in the field , but is the first to chronicle a daring attempt to capture by camera and in moving-picture form the myriad marvels of the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Long and intimate familiarity with the region , an abundant stock of health and strength and courage , and an unsink - able boat -LRB- two , in fact -RRB- with a flat bottom , seem to have constituted the adventurers ' most important equipment for a successful issue to their enterprise .

		As was to have been expected , their cameras fur - nish a rich and unusual illustrative accompaniment to the interesting narrative .

		The sublimities of the Canadian Rocky Moun - tains are well set forth by Mr.
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	, F.R.G.S. , in a beautifully illustrated volume , `` Among the Canadian Alps '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , which re - views in a very readable manner the history of mountain-climbing in that region of awe-inspiring scenery and all but prohibitive alpine peaks .

		From the explorations of Niverville in
1751	DATE	to the final conquest of Mount
Robson	PERSON	, '' the Monarch of the Rockies , '' a few years ago , Mr.
Burpee	PERSON	tells the story of his own and others ' adventures in this land of stupendous summits .

		His pictures , from photo - graphs , of such peaks as Mount Assiniboine , '' the Canadian Matterhorn , '' Mount Wapta , Mount Le - froy ,
Mount Resplendant	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- named , evidently , by neither a Latin nor a French scholar -RRB- , and
Mount Robson	PERSON	, heighten the marvel of their ever having been even approached by the daring mountaineer .

		Lake and waterfall , mountain slope and snow -
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 457 capped summit , are realistically set before us in the half-hundred -LRB- less one -RRB- excellent views , some of which must have been difficult to capture with the camera .

		Bibliography and maps close this interesting and well-written book .

		The volume is ornamentally bound and boxed .

		Mr.
Thomas Dykes Beasley	PERSON	emigrated from En - gland to
California	LOCATION	in his early manhood , and had the great joy of meeting
Bret Harte	PERSON	in
San Fran	LOCATION	- cisco on the eve of that author 's rise to fame as the creator of the
Heathen Chinee	ORGANIZATION	.

		That was forty -
four years ago	DATE	, but so strong was the impression made on the young Englishman by the American author that the former has now felt moved to trace the latter 's footsteps among the
Sierras	LOCATION	; and he has told the story of his travels in `` A Tramp through the
Bret Harte	PERSON	Country , '' which he calls '' a plain unvarnished tale , '' and which , though not containing much about
Bret Harte	PERSON	, is somewhat reminiscent of him and his times and associates , and is very good reading , not lacking in '' local color '' and , no cold commendation , erring rather on the side of brevity than of length .

		Abundant views from the author 's camera , with a map of the seven counties traversed by him , accompany the narra - tive , and the whole is put into excellent book form by the house of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Charles A. Murdock	PERSON	supplies a '' foreword '' giving an outline of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's life .

		Fit accompaniment to the opening of the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Arthur Bullard	PERSON	's authoritative histori - cal and descriptive work , ''
Panama	LOCATION	: The Canal , the Country , the People '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , comes out in a new , revised , and enlarged edition , two chap - ters having been added since the first appearance of the book three years ago .

		These two chapters appropriately record the finishing of the big job and give a forward glance at the prospective profits to accrue .

		Of the six hundred pages in the volume , more than half are devoted to the history of the Isthmus from the earliest times , the remainder to researches of a more immediate and personal and consequently more vividly interesting character .

		Many books have been inspired by this greatest of engineering enterprises , but none more acceptable to the general reader than Mr.
Bullard	PERSON	's well-writ - ten and well-illustrated volume .

		Seven full-page plates are added to the present edition , making more than two-score illustrations in all .

		The best of the many excellences of Mr.
F. Hop	PERSON	- kinson
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's '' In
Dickens	PERSON	's
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is the remarkable faithfulness with which his char - coal drawings reproduce the smoky , dingy , but picturesque aspect of the great city 's old and time-stained buildings .

		The peculiar griminess of ancient brickwork he pictures with astonishing veri - similitude , nor is his medium unsuited to the shad - owy interiors he has selected to depict .

		Treating the
London	LOCATION	of
Dickens	PERSON	much as he did the
London	LOCATION	of Thackeray a year ago , he presents with pen and pencil the
George Inn	PERSON	of Pickwickian fame ,
Lant Street	PERSON	, where
Bob Sawyer	PERSON	had his lodgings , the
George	PERSON	and Vulture , the Bull at
Rochester	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	Bridge ,
St. Martin	ORGANIZATION	's - in-the-Fields ,
Covent Garden Market	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Grewgious	PERSON	's office in
Staple Inn	LOCATION	, and other Dickensian localities , with a final chapter on
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's last resting place in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	.

		There are twenty-two drawings , a portrait of
Dick	PERSON	- ens now first published from a photograph taken in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, two facsimile letters that are also new to the public , and other illustrative features .

		Quotations from the novelist 's works , comment , and anecdote go to fill out the printed pages .

		What the artist-author has most enjoyed in this '' labor of love , '' as he calls it , is '' the expressing in another form and through another medium than those used by my fellow-craftsmen , the wonderful velvet blacks , soft vapory skies , and streaming silver - washed streets of
London	LOCATION	an easy matter for any enthusiast , for
London	LOCATION	is charcoal , and char - coal is
London	LOCATION	. ''

		Following in the footsteps of famous authors , with a camera in one hand and a pen in the other , is the favorite recreation of Mr.
Charles S. Olcott	PERSON	, who is described as a business man with a fondness for artistic photography . ''

		The Lure of the Camera '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- proves him to be skilful in this form of art , as indeed had already been demon - strated by his book on
George Eliot	PERSON	's scenes and characters and that on
Walter Scott	PERSON	's country .

		As in those earlier volumes , so now he rambles through districts immortalized in literature , visiting scenes associated with the names of
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and the haunts of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, and others , in this country .

		`` A Day with
John Burroughs	PERSON	'' is one of his most agreeable chapters .

		His views of the
Yellowstone Park	ORGANIZATION	and the
Grand Canon	ORGANIZATION	of
Arizona	LOCATION	are sugges - tive of the wonders of those regions , but are neces - sarily less satisfactory than his pictures of simpler scenes .

		His outlines of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's novels , in con - nection with his rambles through regions familiar to her , are not exactly indispensable ; but in gen - eral he comments interestingly as he pushes onward with his camera . ''

		When I determined to set out once more to traverse and to possess
England	LOCATION	of my heart , it was part of my desire first of all to follow , as far as might be , in the footsteps of Chaucer 's pil - grims .

		Therefore I sought the
Tabard Inn	ORGANIZATION	in
Southwark	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus begins Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	in `` England of My Heart : Spring '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- to be followed by the other seasons .

		Kent ,
Sussex	LOCATION	, and
Hants	LOCATION	are the counties devoted to vernal con - templation , and the list of places visited is an inviting one to lovers of
England	LOCATION	's quieter haunts .


Dartford	LOCATION	,
Rochester	LOCATION	,
Faversham	LOCATION	,
Canterbury	LOCATION	,
Chi	PERSON	- chester ,
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	,
Selborne	LOCATION	these are some of the names that head Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's pages and indi - cate the course of his pleasant ramble .

		In the
England	LOCATION	of his heart , '' in the whole breadth of her delight , there is no industrial city such as infests , ruins , and spoils other lands , and in this she resem - bles her great and dear mother
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		Why this ascription of maternity to
Italy	LOCATION	rather than to
Normandy	LOCATION	or
Denmark	LOCATION	?

		The Roman colonization of
Britain	LOCATION	was not so complete .

		Mr.
Gordon Home	PERSON	furnishes many drawings in harmony with the printed matter .

Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Dr.
Francis E. Clark	PERSON	, founder of the Christian En - deavor Society , and his son
Sydney	LOCATION	, experienced travellers in the land of the Vikings .

		They coordi - nate their stores of knowledge , both book-learning and more immediate acquisitions , in such a manner as to present , first , a panorama of the many attrac - tions of
Sweden	LOCATION	and
Finland	LOCATION	, in letters supposed to have been written by one ''
Phillips	PERSON	'' to a certain '' Judicia , '' and then a similar view of the wonders and beauties of
Norway	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	, in letters from `` Aylmer '' to the same impartial lady , who is asked to decide which of the two accounts reveals the more compelling assemblage of charms .

		But she begs to be excused , and suggests that the letters be published and each reader left to settle the dis - pute for himself .

		Naturally the half-tone picture plays a prominent part -LRB- to the extent of thirty - five excellent illustrations -RRB- in the book , and a map of
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, but not also of
Finland	LOCATION	, is usefully added .

		The style of the narrative is in admirable concord with its pleasing plan ; but why did not the authors choose as accompaniment to their ear - satisfying `` Aylmer '' and '' Judicia '' the classic and beautiful '' Philip '' instead of the modern and prosaic ''
Phillips	PERSON	'' ?

		Further disfigurement is caused by the misprinting of `` Aylmer '' as `` Aly - mer '' in the table of contents .

		It makes the heart ache to turn the pages of Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	's beautiful volume on `` The Forest of Arden '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , with its peaceful pictures of
Dinant	LOCATION	, the
Meuse	LOCATION	, the castle of La Roche , the valley of the Semois , and other haunts of unpretentious charm and innocent hap - piness , and to think that all this loveliness is now made hideous by the ravages of war . ''

		The Ar - dennes , '' wrote the author , before the region had been brought into such painful prominence , `` is comparatively an unknown country , and is likely to remain so . ''

		His discerning praise of the charms of this district , with his score and a half of excel - lent drawings , colored and uncolored , has a mel - ancholy timeliness .

		Much that he has captured with pen and pencil must by this time have suffered grievous disfigurement , if not utter annihilation .

		Elaborately bound and sumptuous in every detail , the book in its handsome box is well adapted to purposes of Christmas presentation .

		In the form of a narrative describing her ninth wedding-tour for she and '' John '' took one every year the author of '' Delightful
Dalmatia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- presents a sort of pano - ramic view , with accompanying explanatory lec - ture , of the eastern shore of the
Adriatic	LOCATION	, or of so much of it as she had the good fortune to visit in a
summer	DATE	's vacation ramble .

		Pola ,
Zara	PERSON	,
Sebenico	LOCATION	,
Spalato	LOCATION	,
Ragusa	LOCATION	, and other places of interest form the framework on which the fabric of interwoven anecdote and history and personal experience is hung .

		That
Dalmatia	LOCATION	offers so many attractions to the tourist will be news to more than one reader , and a visit to its shores in quieter times than the present will be felt to be desirable .

		A profusion of views from photographs , including a colored cover panel and a colored frontispiece , forms no small part of the book 's attractions .

		The author , whose name appears on the title-page as ``
Alice Lee Moque	PERSON	, '' taxes the reader 's credulity by giving her birth-year as
1888	DATE	after describing her Dalmatian trip as her ninth annual wedding-tour .

		With her customary admirable faculty for seeing the beautiful and the joyous in whatever she chooses to write about , Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	paints for us a fair and smiling city in her book , '' The Lure of
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which opens with a general chapter of the same name as the book , and then takes us to
Hyde Park Corner	ORGANIZATION	and
Apsley House	ORGANIZATION	, the Royal Institution , the art galler - ies , clubs , and societies , to the sports and amuse - ments of the English people , to a consideration of '' the living influence of Victorian literature , '' to the architectural and historic glories of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, and elsewhere , ending with an essay on '' The Spirit of
London	LOCATION	Life . ''

		In a chapter on ``
Annie Besant	PERSON	and the Theosophical Society , '' the priestess of occultism is treated with entire serious - ness by
Miss Whiting	PERSON	, who would have us believe that '' Mrs.
Besant	PERSON	brings the message of the vistas of new life that are opening to the world in relig - ion , science , and art . ''

		Thirty-one good pictures from photographs adorn the book , which is further embellished on the front cover and the wrapper .

		Nine times in as many years the public demand for Miss
Mary E. Waller	PERSON	's '' Through the Gates of the Netherlands '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has neces - sitated a new printing of the work .

		Its present appearance in flexible covers of limp leather -LRB- or possibly a clever imitation -RRB- and with a judicious selection of illustrations from the masterpieces of Dutch painting will be welcome to those who enjoy the personal , narrative , anecdotal note in their guide-books .

		Dealing with a part of
Europe	LOCATION	now the object of considerable public notice , it is a timely book , though no longer a brand-new one .

		Its attractive and handy form , as well as its pleasing literary style , commends it to favor .

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS .

		Promise of something worth while is in the very title of `` The Honest House '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a handsome book of quarto dimensions , '' presenting examples of the usual problems which face the home-builder , together with an exposition of the simple architectural principles which underlie them : arranged especially in reference to small house design . ''

		All this wealth of material is placed at our disposal , the title-page tells us , `` by
Ruby Ross Goodnow	PERSON	in collaboration with Rayne Ad - ams '' and with an '' introduction by
Frederick L. Ackerman	PERSON	,
A. I. A.	PERSON	'' That the '' honest house '' in
America	LOCATION	is not invariably a thing of beauty , is admitted at the outset ; and yet , says Mr.
Acker	PERSON	- man , we may take justifiable satisfaction in our domestic architecture , for '' there is something ex - pressed in the plans of the houses themselves , in the very arrangement of the plots of land upon which they stand , which differentiates them from similar houses of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		They do not express landlordism , but rather a group of democratic ideals . ''

		Successively and , one may add , success - fully are handled such topics as the quest of the ideal house , the value of the architect , American
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 459 houses and their European prototypes , the practi - cal problem of house-building , proportion and bal - ance , the useful and the beautiful , surroundings , color , materials , walls , roofs , column and cornice , porches , and so on .

		Examples almost without num - ber are presented to the eye in excellent illustra - tions , both machine-made and hand-made , and a list of other useful books of similar character is appended .

		German art does not hold that place in the world 's esteem that is accorded to Italian art , to Dutch and Flemish art , and to other schools that might be named .

		Hence it has been less written about , and is less familiar to the general public .

		Mrs.
Helen A. Dickinson	PERSON	's elaborate and scholarly volume , '' German Masters of Art '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , helps to supply a manifest want , and is at the same time in all its details a fine example of artistic book - manufacture .

		She divides German painting into three schools , that of
Cologne	LOCATION	, of
Swabia	LOCATION	, and of Nuremberg or
Franconia	LOCATION	; the first being character - ized by a certain dreamy or lyric quality , while the second is pre-eminently a narrative or illustrative art , and the third shows striking qualities of virility and passion and dramatic force .

		It is the old masters and not the moderns that engage Mrs.
Dickinson	PERSON	's attention , and in a series of thirty-seven chapters , with the help of more than a hundred reproductions of noteworthy paintings , she ably introduces them to our better acquaintance .

		The quarto size of the book contributes to the satisfac - tory presentation of these many specimens of early German art to the eye , four of them being in color , and one hundred and ten in monotone .

		Finally , the writer 's
Heidelberg	LOCATION	degree and her experience as university lecturer on art operate not at all to her disadvantage in winning her readers ' confi - dence .

		The charm of artistic book-manufacture makes itself felt in `` The Charm of the Antique '' -LRB-
Hearst	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- by Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Shackleton	PERSON	, who are experienced collectors of old furniture and other memorials of bygone times .

		They know the joy of acquiring for
thirty-five cents	MONEY	a genuine Sheraton armchair disguised almost beyond recog - nition by a wadded covering of calico , and of pick - ing up for one lira a lion 's head of iron that has formerly spouted water in the garden of an old Florentine palace .

		Some of their adventures in this species of hunting , with advice and comment and description such as other collectors will read with interest , are presented in attractive style in the book 's score of animated and anecdotal chap - ters , each treating of '' the charm '' of some phase of the antique .

		Illustrations in lavish abundance , including an exquisitely colored frontispiece , adorn the volume and heighten the desire to become a col - lector if one is not already a collector , and to achieve fresh triumphs in the art of collecting if one is .

		The book is ornamentalty bound and neatly boxed .

		Few are so well versed in the arts and crafts of the American Indians as Mr.
George Wharton James	PERSON	, who has already written with authority on their basket-making and other industries , and now presents an historical and descriptive account of `` Indian Blankets and Their Makers '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , with excellent colored pictures of their work , and a great number of uncolored pictures .

		How deft and ingenious our aborigines were in the textile arts is known to comparatively few ; but the expert in such matters dare to assert that there is nothing in modern weaving that will not be found anticipated in such fragments of matting and blankets and other fabrics as have been exhumed from Indian graves that were centuries old when
Columbus	LOCATION	was born .

		Mr.
James	PERSON	's book , a quarto of more than two hundred pages , is the painstaking work of one more desirous of giving full and exact information than of achieving originality .

		Twenty-two chap - ters and four appended papers present the results of his researches .

		He uses , wisely enough , the still uncommon word `` Amerind '' to denote the Amer - ican Indian , and he does well also to prefer the spelling ''
Navaho	ORGANIZATION	'' to its Spanish equivalent .

		The Navaho blanket , it may be noted , forms the main theme of his treatise .

		The beauty and softness of some of these products of the
Navaho	ORGANIZATION	loom , as pic - tured in the book , are remarkable . ''

		Some people collect old furniture , some old books .

		I for many years have been a collector of old houses . ''

		Thus writes Mr.
John Martin Ham	PERSON	- mond , author of '' Colonial Mansions of
Maryland	LOCATION	and
Delaware	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a sumptuous octavo containing historical accounts and fine illustrations of nearly two-score eighteenth-century houses , largely in the region about
Baltimore	LOCATION	, the author 's home , whence with camera and a pair of intelli - gently observant eyes he sallies occasionally forth on his collecting expeditions .

		His assortment of historic houses such as the Chase , the
Hammond	PERSON	, the
Brice	PERSON	, and the
Ridout	PERSON	houses of
Annapolis	LOCATION	, the
Ratcliffe Manor	ORGANIZATION	,
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	,
Hampton	LOCATION	,
Mount Airy	ORGANIZATION	,
Belvoir	LOCATION	, and
Montmorenci	PERSON	shows that he has wisely given his attention to the near rather than to the remote .

		The outlying sections of
Maryland	LOCATION	are but little represented in his book , and
Delaware	LOCATION	occupies hardly a sixth of its bulk .

		There are others of our
Atlantic States	LOCATION	that can show houses of earlier construction , notably
Massachusetts	LOCATION	with her examples of seventeenth-century domestic archi - tecture , but
Maryland	LOCATION	has preserved her old houses more carefully than some other members of the colonial sisterhood . ''

		Much of the available data , '' says Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	-LRB- as if '' data '' were a singular noun -RRB- , '' of the history of
Maryland	LOCATION	and
Delaware	LOCATION	will be found in the voluminous writings of
John Thomas Scharff	PERSON	, '' to whom and to others he pays due acknowledgment .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE .

		An old favorite among book-illustrators is Gold - smith 's masterpiece , '' The Vicar of Wakefield . ''

		In a substantial quarto richly illustrated by Mr.
Ed	PERSON	-
mund J. Sullivan	PERSON	the immortal story is now offered to the public by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Six - teen colored pictures of sufficient brightness and variety of hue to please those who like this sort of art are given in full-page form , also thrice as many equally large uncolored drawings , and there are smaller designs as chapter-headings .

		To add that the book is printed at the
Edinburgh University	ORGANIZATION	460 THE BIAJL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	Press will be commendation enough of its typo - graphical excellence .

		It is bound in blue and gold , and is well boxed .

		Mr.
Henry De Vere Stacpoole	PERSON	's metrical versions of
Villon	PERSON	's poems , already known to the English public , appear from the house of the
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	in a generously margined , handsomely printed volume , entitled '' The Poems of
Francois Villon	PERSON	, '' and defined as to contents by a prelim - inary note : '' The two Testaments of
Frangois Villon	PERSON	with a running commentary and notes , also the ballades of the Grand Testament translated into English with a translation of various Ballades and
Rondeaux	PERSON	from the general poems . ''

		A short treatise on
Villon	PERSON	and his times precedes the poems . ''

		God made him a robber , it is true , '' admits his translator and admirer , '' but at least let us thank God that He did not make him a tradesman . ''

		Fur - ther , he pronounces Villon '' the greatest and truest of French verse - writers , '' and '' the only French poet who is entirely real . ''

		Mr.
Stacpoole	PERSON	's faith - fulness to the original sometimes proves harmful to the smoothness of his own verse , but that is better than too great freedom of rendering .

		An appen - dix contains the French text of the ballads and rondeaux .

		With no fewer than eight able competitors al - ready in the field , Mr.
Ernest J. B. Kirtlan	PERSON	essays a new translation of '' Beowulf '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		English prose , with but a hint of archaism in its structure and vocabulary , is the medium chosen ; and the result is an agreeably readable and apparently faithful rendering of the Anglo-Saxon a version more quickly intelligible to most readers than the somewhat labored poetic translation of
Morris	PERSON	and
Wyatt	PERSON	.

		Introduction , footnotes , and appended matter show that Mr.
Kirtlan	PERSON	is not lacking in scholarly preparation for his task .

		Mr.
Frederic Lawrence	PERSON	contributes a colored frontispiece and decorative initials and cover-design .

		A thin-paper , flexibly bound , gilt-edged edition of that excellent anthology , '' Golden Poems , '' com - piled by the late
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	, comes from the McClurg publishing house .

		First issued in
1881	DATE	, and again published in an enlarged form in
1906	DATE	, the book has not failed of an appreciative reception .

		That it is no mere piece of book - making , no perfunctory putting together of passa - ble material , those well know who remember Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's fondness for these carefully chosen poems and his astonishing ability to repeat them from memory .

		They number nearly five hundred , and are from both British and American poets .

		Tables of contents , of authors , and of first lines are given , and previous errors of printing are cor - rected .

		In its new form the book is a most invit - ing pocket volume .

		In a five - volume , thin-paper edition , embellished with the original illustrations , Mr.
Clifton John	PERSON	- son 's set of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's chief works comes neatly boxed and in every respect suitable for Christmas purchase and Christmas gift .

		The books , in the order in which Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	first gave them forth , are '' Cape Cod , '' '' The
Maine Woods	PERSON	, '' `` Walden , '' `` A Week on the
Concord	LOCATION	and
Merrimack Rivers	PERSON	, '' and '' Excursions . ''

		Emerson 's biographical sketch of his naturalist friend is prefixed to the selections grouped under the last-named title ; introductions by Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	are to be found in the other vol - umes .

		The publishers -LRB-
Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- call this a pocket edition , as in fact it is , though in the spacious typography of the original larger issue .

		Mr.
Arthur Rackham	PERSON	's name as illustrator of Shakespeare 's '' Midsummer Night 's Dream '' -LRB- Dou - bleday -RRB- is adequate warrant for the excellence of the elaborate quarto edition of the mirthful fan - tasy , issued this season in a cheaper , more popular , form .

		So generously spaced as to run to the length of one hundred and thirty-four pages , the play is lavishly illustrated both with full page drawings , colored and uncolored , and with smaller designs scattered through the text .

		Mr.
Rackham	PERSON	's render - ings of the Puckish conceits so abundantly supplied to him are admirable , and the delicate tinting of his colored drawings is in agreeable contrast with the more garish pictures that coruscate in so many of the books designed to make glad the holiday season .

		To the
Ballantyne Press	ORGANIZATION	credit is due for the excel - lent typography of this work , and the
Hentschel Colour-type Process	ORGANIZATION	has demonstrated its efficiency in reproducing the artist 's conceptions .

		RECORDS OF THE PAST .

		Student wit and student pranks enter inevitably and very acceptably into the truthful chronicle of the fortunes of any typical American college .

		The part played by the undergraduates in moulding the history and fixing the character of their Alma Mater is no negligible factor .

		Mr.
Wilder Dwight Quint	PERSON	makes the student body as well as the faculty and the trustees fill important roles in his book , '' The Story of Dartmouth '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a production similar in style and scope to Mr.
Arthur Stanwood	PERSON	Pier 's readable account of Har - vard , which came from the same publishing house a year ago .

		As in that work , pencil drawings from a skilful hand in this instance the artist is Mr.
John Albert Seaford	PERSON	are not unwisely chosen in - stead of photographic views to present to the eye some of the more noted academic features described or mentioned by the pen .

		From its foundation in
1770	DATE	, through the critical period made famous by the great
Dartmouth Case	ORGANIZATION	and
Webster	PERSON	's memor - able plea for the college , down to the present time , Mr.
Quint	PERSON	lovingly and with scholarly care traces the history of this pre-eminently American or '' national '' college , as its graduates and friends like to call it and its claim to the title is not unfounded , since it draws more students from out - side
New Hampshire	LOCATION	than does Harvard -LRB- the col - lege proper -RRB- from outside
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Both the educator and the general reader will enjoy Mr.
Quint	PERSON	's book .

		Additions to the series are likely to receive a welcome .

		In his Preface to his third book on the metropolis of
England	LOCATION	, Sir
Laurence Gomme	PERSON	explains wherein it differs from the preceding two . ''

		The Govern - ance of
London	LOCATION	'' had to do with '' a newly discov - ered aspect of the question of origins , '' and '' The Making of
London	LOCATION	'' concerned itself with applying '' the results of this study to the evolution of the city , '' while in ''
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- the author
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 461 claims '' to have discovered the great fact of his - torical continuity , conscious and effective conti - nuity , underlying the main issues of
London	LOCATION	life throughout all its changes . ''


Freeman	PERSON	and his fol - lowers have proved that the conquest of
Britain	LOCATION	resulted in the dominance of English government , language , and institutions generally ; but Sir
Lau	PERSON	- rence contends that one need not therefore conclude that in no spot in
England	LOCATION	are there any survivals from pre-English times .


London	LOCATION	, in his study of it , is rich in such survivals .

		Whatever may be the soundness or the unsoundness of his theories , the book is a monument to his antiquarian research and at the same time a novel and interesting treatment of an inexhaustible theme .

		Portraits , old prints , ancient coins and implements , historic ruins , maps and charts , have been freely drawn upon for illus - trating the volume , which is handsomely printed at
Edinburgh	LOCATION	in the full-faced type that we associate with Scottish presses .

		Our old colonial houses , though but infants in comparison with the historic mansions and baro - nial halls of
England	LOCATION	, are nevertheless extremely interesting to us and especially pleasing by way of contrast with much that is more pretentious and far less attractive in modern domestic architecture .

		Miss
Mary H. Northend	PERSON	's '' Historic Homes of
New England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- describes and pic - tures a score of the most noteworthy of these old dwellings in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, with one in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	.

		They are
the House of Seven Gables	ORGANIZATION	and the
Pickering	LOCATION	house in
Salem	LOCATION	; the
Hooper	PERSON	house , known as The Lindens , at Dan - vers ; the
Rogers	PERSON	house , at
Peabody	LOCATION	; the
Jeremiah Lee	PERSON	house ,
Marblehead	LOCATION	; Ladd-Gilman house .

		Exe - ter ;
Adams	PERSON	house ,
Newbury	LOCATION	; the
Spencer Pierce	PERSON	and the
Dalton	LOCATION	houses ,
Newburyport	LOCATION	; Dummer mansion ,
Byfield	LOCATION	;
Warner	ORGANIZATION	house ,
Portsmouth	LOCATION	;
Wentworth	LOCATION	house , Little Harbor ;
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	house ,
Hillsboro	LOCATION	; Savory house ,
Groveland	LOCATION	; Stark mansion ,
Dunbarton	LOCATION	;
Saltonstall	PERSON	house ,
Haverhill	LOCATION	; Kittredge house ,
Andover	LOCATION	; Roy all house , Medf ord ;
Longfellow	LOCATION	house ,
Cambridge	LOCATION	; Quincy mansion ,
Quincy	PERSON	; and
Middleton	PERSON	house ,
Bristol	LOCATION	.

		Good views of exterior and interior abound , and the ornate cover shows the famous seven-gable structure in gilt .

		The historical and descriptive text gives evidence of care and thoroughness .

		A novel deriva - tion catches the eye , '' clapboard '' from '' clay - board , '' because the houses first finished in this man - ner were daubed with clay before receiving the boards now known as clapboards .

		It is a quarter-century since
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, some - time fellow of
Merton College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	LOCATION	, delighted his brother Oxonians and many others with his historical and descriptive notes on the famous old university .

		That book , with its numerous exquisite drawings by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	,
R. Kent Thomas	PERSON	,
A. Brunet-Debaines	PERSON	, and others , is probably no longer easily obtainable ; hence the acceptability of a new edition with what will be to many modern readers equally attractive and even more attractive illustrations in the colored plates of Mr.
George F. Carline	PERSON	, R.B.A. '' Oxford '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- now ap - pears in crown quarto form , printed at the Edin - burgh
University Press	ORGANIZATION	in large type on Arnold hand-made paper , and limited in its issue to three hundred and fifty copies .

		Turning these pages from the versatile pen of `` Andrew of the brindled hair , '' one may perchance feel an increased interest in the venerable buildings they describe from the possibility , not inconceivably remote at present writing , that some such disaster as lately befell
Louvain	LOCATION	may one day be the lot of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many curious anecdotes , traditional or historical , enliven these chapters , which , despite the antiquity of their theme , are brisk with life and color .

		Very successful has Miss
Mary Caroline Craw	PERSON	- ford been in imparting an early
Yankee	ORGANIZATION	flavor to the pages of her '' Social Life in
New England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which displays on a some - what broader canvas the same kind of char - acters and incidents as in her former works on '' Old Boston Days and Ways '' and '' Romantic Days in Old
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		Her matter is grouped un - der such chapter-headings as '' In the Little Red Schoolhouse , '' '' Going to College , '' '' Choosing a Profession , '' '' Getting Married , '' '' Setting up Housekeeping , '' '' Reading Books , '' and `` Amuse - ments of the Big Town . ''

		The material for these studies is not meagre , as her Preface makes evident , and she has put it to good use .

		Illustrative of old - time moral standards are the penalties imposed at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	for various misdemeanors a century and three-quarters ago .

		Profane language was punish - able by a fine that might reach a maximum of two shillings and sixpence , whereas drunkenness and lying would each cost the offender not more than one shilling and sixpence .

		Miss
Crawford	PERSON	uses the name
Massachusetts	LOCATION	when she must mean either the
Bay Colony	ORGANIZATION	or the
Plymouth Colony	ORGANIZATION	, as the two were not consolidated until
1692	DATE	.

		For instance , she says , ''
Massachusetts	LOCATION	established schools by law in
1642	DATE	. ''

		Her picture of '' the last of the farm boys and his pair of oxen '' might tempt an old New Englander to draw his pen through '' pair '' and substitute '' yoke . ''

		In lavish illustrative features the book is not inferior to its predecessors .

		Based largely on
Washington	LOCATION	's own diaries and letters , as made available to students in recent years , Mr.
Frederick Trevor Hill	PERSON	's ''
Washington	LOCATION	the Man of Action '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a trustworthy , straightforward , succinct account of our foremost national hero , and , as its dedication `` to the boys of the
Alf Club	ORGANIZATION	'' shows , is designed for young readers .

		Indeed , its quarto form , great primer type , abundant colored pictures , and other striking features place it at once in the juvenile class ; and though one might almost say that the book weighs half as much as some of the readers for whom it is intended , it is likely to please them none the less for that .

		Comte J. Onfroy de Breville -LRB- '' Job '' -RRB- furnishes the illustrations , which will be found not deficient in life and action and color .

		Anecdotal and sufficiently tinged with romance , `` The Man Napoleon '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
William Henry Hudson	PERSON	, justifies its addition to the thou - sand already existing accounts of the great Corsican by its engaging style and by the well-conceived and elaborately executed colored drawings , by
Baron Myrbach	PERSON	, that accompany the reading matter .

		The writing of such a book is the more remarkable be - 462 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	cause its author both explicitly and implicitly dis - claims admiration for the '' colossal image with feet of clay '' whom he so interestingly places be - fore us .

		Material , more or less trustworthy , is of course available in abundance for an intimate study like this ; the chief merit of Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's book is its combination of impartiality with vivid interest a blend not common in biography .

		HOLIDAY FICTION .

		Bright and sunny , whimsical and humorous , and not lacking in the element of romance , Mr.
Mere	PERSON	- dith
Nicholson	PERSON	's story of '' The Poet '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- is likely to win him new friends while attaching to him more warmly the old ones .

		In geniality of manner and wisdom of life the book shows decided advance over his earlier works of fiction .

		Obvious to the discerning reader is the Poet 's strong resem - blance to the author 's fellow Hoosier , Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, undoubtedly the model after whom the gentle and lovable hero of the tale is patterned .

		Appropriately enough , the Poet 's child friend ,
Marjorie	PERSON	, the rather pathetic sufferer from her parents ' mutual uncongeniality , plays a promi - nent part in the story ; and his kind offices as peace - maker , also his wise and friendly aid to a young brother poet , and with it all his interest in others ' affairs of the heart , while he himself remains but an on-looker at the game of love , are so handled by the author as to invest his amiable hero with an increas - ing charm .

		Marjorie 's infant dialect is rather over - done and wearisome ; otherwise the characters are wholly pleasing .

		The book is provided with cheer - ful colored pictures and tinted decorations .

		Betty was a girl with a splendid dowry , '' youth , health , gaiety of heart , an indomitable spirit , and a pair of the softest , loveliest , most misleading dark eyes that were ever seen . ''

		So she is described by Miss
Molly Elliot Seawell	PERSON	in ''
Betty	PERSON	's
Virginia	LOCATION	Christmas '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , wherein also her love for Lieutenant
John Hope Fortescue	PERSON	,
U. S. A.	PERSON	, and the happy issue of that romance , are narrated .

		The antepenultimate chapter , headed , with unnecessary disregard for orthodox orthography , `` Recom - pence , '' brings the lovers to the exchange of vows in good earnest , and the following chapter , joyously entitled ''
Gloria	PERSON	, '' sees them safely married , with one chapter still remaining in which to gather up the loose threads .

		As in her other novels , the writer shows her artistry in depicting southern scenes and characters , the local color including , of course , that of the negro as well as the brighter hues of Betty 's complexion .

		It is a good , wholesome Christmas tale , illustrated with unusual wealth of colored pic - tures and outline drawings .

		Miss Zona
Gale	PERSON	's short stories of Friendship Vil - lage have won favor with readers , and such a collec - tion of these tales from her pen as now appears under the title , `` Neighborhood Stories '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , is assured of a welcome .

		The frank and fearless
Calliope Marsh	PERSON	is supposed to be the nar - rator throughout ; and she is certainly a character worth knowing , and her vigorous speech is worth listening to .

		`` When I die , '' is one of
Calliope	ORGANIZATION	's utterances , '' do n't you get anybody that 's always treated me like a dog and put them on the front seat .

		Make 'em sit back . ''

		Miss
Gale	PERSON	believes in '' a Romance of Life as much finer than sentimen - tality as modern romance is saner than chivalry , '' and it is this wholesome romance that is now dawn - ing upon Friendship Village .

		If you wish to learn more about it , read the '' Neighborhood Stories '' of
Calliope Marsh	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is ornately bound and has a frontispiece showing a group of Friendship Village faces .

		Published under the auspices of the
California	LOCATION	Writers ' Club , '' West Winds '' is described on its title-page as ''
California	LOCATION	's book of fiction , written by
California	LOCATION	authors and illustrated by
California	LOCATION	artists . ''

		It is also , of course , published by a Cali - fornia publishing house , that of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Herman Whita	PERSON	- ker is the
California	LOCATION	editor , as he is also the author of one of the stories , the first of the series .

		The other writers , as their names stand in the table of contents , are as follows :
Elizabeth Abbey Everett	PERSON	,
Shirley A. Mansfield	PERSON	,
Sarah Thurston Nott	PERSON	,
Agnes Morley Cleaveland	PERSON	,
Rebecca N. Porter	PERSON	,
Julia B. Foster	PERSON	,
Charles F. Lummis	PERSON	,
Jack London	PERSON	,
Hester A. Dickinson	PERSON	,
Elizabeth Griswold Rowe	PERSON	,
Frances Orr Allen	PERSON	, Mrs.
Carl Bank	PERSON	,
Harriet Holmes	PERSON	Has - lett , and
Torrey Connor	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' spread of life , '' as the editor of the book says in his Preface , extends from
Old Mexico	LOCATION	to `
Alaska	LOCATION	; and the characters include swarthy Mexicans ,
Gringoes	LOCATION	, bandits and peons , miners and mule-drivers , and all the varied types of that far-western wonderland .

		The pic - tures , in sepia-brown , harmonize with the general color-scheme of the book , as also with the spirit of the text they illustrate .

		Not all new to print , the tales are none the less full of novel interest and show the
California	LOCATION	standard of short-story-writing to be a high one .

		A slight thing , but not inferior to her more elabo - rate works of fiction , the story called '' The Hands of Esau '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Margaret Deland	PERSON	, illustrates with vividness and pathos the inescapa - ble influence of heredity .

		How
Tom Vail	PERSON	, a con - vict 's son , wooed and won
Nina Morgan	PERSON	, and then what happened , will be read with no languid inter - est by Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	's many admirers .

		It impresses one as a bit of tragic reality from the very heart of life .

		Two good illustrations and an ornamental binding set off the excellences of the well-told story .

		In amplified form and with realistic touches and suitable embellishment , Dr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	tells in his own pleasing fashion the story related much more briefly in the last dozen verses of the second chapter of
St. Luke	LOCATION	. ''

		The Lost Boy '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is a suitable book for a Christmas gift or for Sunday-school use .

		A picture of the child Jesus in the temple , surrounded by the elders , precedes the narrative , and the cover and wrapper are also appropriately adorned by the artist .

		A warm welcome from those seeking Christmas gift books is assured for the '' Ooze Leather Christ - mas Series , '' published by Messrs.
Browne	PERSON	& How -
ell Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in ten little volumes bound in soft , flexible leather .

		The stories have been chosen from excel - lent sources and are not only brightly attractive but also peculiarly appropriate to the season .

		They comprise ''
Santa Glaus	PERSON	and Little Billee , '' by
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 463 Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	; '' Christmas Roses , '' by Miss
Anne O'Hagen	PERSON	; ''

Christmas	DATE	, '' by Miss
Lillian Bennett Thompson	PERSON	; '' Next Christmas , '' by Mr.

Santa Glaus	PERSON	on the Beach , '' by Mr.

T. W. Hall	PERSON	; '' Their Christmas , '' by Mr.

Peter	PERSON	's Christmas Present , '' by Miss
Anne Story Allen	PERSON	; and '' When
Santa Glaus	PERSON	Was Lost , '' by Mr.
Bertram Lebhar	PERSON	.

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		The fascinations of book-collecting took captive Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald	PERSON	when he was but a boy ; and later , the charm having lost nothing of its potency , he wrote understandingly and well about first edi - tions , unique copies , early printers , curious bind - ings , and similar bibliological topics .

		This season brings forth a neat edition of his work , first pub - lished in
1886	DATE	, called '' The Book Fancier ; or , The Romance of Book Collecting '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		With some lack of entire frankness , the date originally appended to the preface is omitted , as if to convey the impression of a new work , whereas it is a nearly exact reprint , in larger type and with almost iden - tical pagination , of the first edition .

		Exactness of reproduction has been slightly departed from in the chapter headings , several of which are a little short - ened .

		The book , as some will recall , treats of col - lectors and dealers , the
Mazarin Bible	LOCATION	, incunabula ,
Elzevirs	LOCATION	,
Plantins	LOCATION	,
Caxtons	PERSON	, and old printers of both
England	LOCATION	and the Continent , libraries , curiosi - ties of printing and binding ,
Grangerizing	LOCATION	, and
Dickensiana	LOCATION	, illustrated books and '' luxurious '' editions , the auction room , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	folios and quartos .

		Speaking of the difficulties of book - classification , the author asks , choosing an absurdly simple problem in cataloguing , not in classification , and making a curious choice of auxiliary verb : '' Would we enter '
Coningsby	PERSON	, ' for instance , under Disraeli or Beaconsfield ? ''

		Undoubtedly this enter - tainingly bookish book from the variously gifted Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	's prolific pen deserved the honor of a handsome new edition .

		A good collection of inscriptions , mottoes , place - names , sententious utterances , and similar bits of prose and verse , has been compiled by Miss
Esther Matson	PERSON	, with the title , `` A Book of Inscriptions '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- .

		Its contents are grouped under three heads , '' Much Ado about the Place Name , '' '' Mottoes for Hearth and
Garth	PERSON	, '' and `` Accompani - ments for Gifts , '' with an '' Ende-Word '' in the form of an old house-blessing of unknown author - ship .

		The selections are from both ancient and modern sources , and will be found to include many unhackneyed mottoes that are just as good as the time-worn and familiar .

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's '' Put not your trust in money , but put your money in trust , '' might well be inscribed over the door of a banking house or trust company .

		Miss
Matson	PERSON	puts it in a section devoted to '' little homely things . ''

		Her dining-room mottoes fail to include the French say - ing , '' II n'est sauce que d'appetit , '' though else - where in her book she draws freely on foreign sources .

		Her scholarly little volume seems likely to supply a want in its department , especially with those who at this season are hunting for the proper '' sentiment '' to go with the Christmas gift .

		Stimulating , as its name would indicate , is Mr.
Richard Wightman	PERSON	's '' Soul-Spur '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a book as sure to win favor as it is certain that everyone is eager to know more about the half - hidden things of his own life and his own soul .

		Observation , reflection , intuition , friendly counsel , apt illustration of these is the book compounded , and in some of its bracing and wholesome utter - ances and admonitions it suggests
Emerson	LOCATION	, from whom indeed it fittingly quotes .

		Here is a sample of the author 's style : '' It is good to do little essen - tial things with a hot heart , to tend small tasks with a fine zeal which makes the seemingly insignificant employment big and important .

		In an inn at
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	there was a flight of stone stairs .

		They were very dirty stairs .

		They had apparently not been washed since the first man went up them .


John Ruskin	PERSON	saw them and the sight smote his soul into indignation .

		Straightway he procured a bucket and a broom and scrubbed the stairs pains - takingly .

		Was he less an artist for this menial service ?

		... Fundamental fidelities are the par - ents of art . ''

		These chapters on the common but supremely important things of life are introduced each by a sententious bit of original verse , except in one instance where prose is used .

		More fertile in new words than even the immor - tal author of '' Jabberwocky , '' Mr.
Gelett Burgess	PERSON	feels it incumbent on him to be his own glossarist .

		Hence we have ''
Burgess	PERSON	Unabridged : A New Dictionary of Words You Have Always Needed '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , appropriately and ludicrously illustrated by Mr.
Herbert Roth	PERSON	-LRB- if that be the polite desig - nation of ``
Herb Roth	PERSON	'' -RRB- , and warranted by the author to '' solidify the chinks of conversation , ex - press the inexpressible , make our English language ornamental , elegant , distinguished , accurate . ''

		One hundred new words and their derivatives are alpha - betically arranged , with explanations and illustra - tions in prose and verse , and with pictures to help out the text where needed .

		Mr.
Burgess	PERSON	modestly omits his past triumphs in word-making , such as '' bromide '' and '' goop , '' and concerns himself only with '' the words of to-morrow . ''

		He who would acquire '' spuzz , '' learn the art of '' tashivation , '' avoid the danger of becoming a '' jirriwig '' or a '' leolump , '' and escape the clutches of the '' vorian - der , '' should carry in his pocket and daily study ''
Burgess	PERSON	Unabridged . ''

		The publications of the firm of
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have an attractiveness of form , a distinction of design , that induce high hopes of excellence in the reading matter ; nor have these hopes often been disappointed .

		Miss
Myrtle Glenn Roberts	PERSON	's idealistic drama , '' The Foot of the Rain - bow , '' combines beauty of outward appearance , in its tinted
Normandy	LOCATION	vellum pages and neatness of print and binding , with merits of a higher order in its thought and expression .

		With a rural setting and with farming people as the characters , the old story of chasing the rainbow for the blessings that lie immediately at hand is told with dramatic force and poetic imagery .

		It is a parable in dramatic 464 THE DIAJL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	form hardly suited for the professional stage , from a business point of view , but well fitted for recital or amateur acting .

		Two more are added to Mr.
Oliver Huckel	PERSON	's
Wagner	PERSON	translations , ''
Rienzi	PERSON	'' and '' The Flying Dutchman '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Though latest in the order of issue in this series , these operas were among the earliest in the order of creation , being produced at
Dresden	LOCATION	in
1842	DATE	and
1843	DATE	respectively ; and it was `` Rienzi '' that established its author 's reputation as a composer .

		Mr.
Huckel	PERSON	's metre , with the excep - tion of occasional songs that vary the monotony , is blank verse at once flexible and strong , spirited and sufficiently stately .

		Three photogravures in tint accompany each opera , and a good historical and critical Introduction is provided for each by the translator .

		Mr.
Huckel	PERSON	's skill and taste in this chosen work of his have already been recognized in the nine preceding numbers of the series .

		Printing and ornamentation are in harmony with the other excellences of these attractive volumes .

		Indefatigable in `` her work of collecting and edit - ing in popular form the folklore of our Indian tribes ,
Miss Katharine B. Judson	PERSON	has issued a third volume of these native legends under the title , '' Myths and Legends of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	and the Great Lakes '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , with pictures show - ing examples of Indian graphic and industrial arts .

		The stories are all short and of the simple and childish nature peculiar to such primitive exercises of the imagination , with animals playing important parts in most of them .

		Many of the
Hiawatha	LOCATION	legends are given in their original crude form , while other myths present curious points of resemblance to the folklore of the Old World .

		Stories of the creation and the flood are especially noteworthy in this respect , though missionary influence is doubt - less accountable for many if not most of these simi - larities .

		But no such suggestion is to be found in the mass of these primitive attempts to explain the phenomena of the universe .

		The pioneer labors of Mr.
Albert E. Jenks	PERSON	among the wild-rice Indians of the upper lakes , of Mr.
James Mooney	PERSON	among the Cherokees , of Mr.
George Catlin	PERSON	among the tribes of the upper
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and of
Schoolcraft	LOCATION	in his noted ethnological researches , are placed under con - tribution by
Miss Judson	PERSON	, with due acknowledg - ments in her Preface .

		Seventeen heroines of song and story are passed in review by
Miss Mary C. Sturgeon	ORGANIZATION	in a handsome volume entitled '' Women of the Classics '' -LRB- Crow - ell -RRB- .

		Seven of these characters are taken from
Homer	LOCATION	, three from JEsehylus , two from Sophocles , four from
Euripides	LOCATION	, and one , the sorrowful Dido , from
Virgil	PERSON	.

		In descriptive prose of her own and in standard metrical versions from the above-named poets ,
Miss Sturgeon	LOCATION	presents her heroines and gives to each a personality and a history that make them more distinct and real than they have hitherto been in the minds of most readers .

		Some unusually good reproductions of more or less famous paint - ings offer the same classic heroines to the eye with the single exception of lo , whose form and features are left to the imagination .

		The book , printed at the
Ballantyne Press	ORGANIZATION	, is a work of art , its only blemish being the unutilitarian stiffness and consequent fragility of its binding .

		Told from the standpoint of an American born and resident in
China	LOCATION	, as the publisher 's announce - ment informs us , the seven stories or sketches that make up the contents of '' Bamboo : Tales of the Orient-Born '' -LRB- Elder -RRB- are genuinely far-eastern in tone , and leave in the reader 's mind no doubt of their trustworthiness as pictures of the Orient .

		The author 's name appears on the title-page as ''
Lyon Sharman	PERSON	, '' and internal evidence favors the hypothesis that
Lyon Sharman	PERSON	is a woman and the daughter of an American missionary .

		In style the little sketches have distinction , and their occasional autobiographic note contributes to their charm .

		Distinction , too , is not absent from the book 's out - v/ard appearance .

		Mr.
Franklin P. Adams	PERSON	, of well-earned fame as a smile-producer with his neat bits of humorous verse -LRB- and occasionally prose -RRB- in newspapers and magazines , gathers some of his happiest hits into a little volume entitled '' By and Large '' -LRB- Double - day -RRB- .

		His opening group of jingles , suggested by passages from
Horace	PERSON	,
Catullus	LOCATION	, and
Propertius	PERSON	, are bright and amusing ; and he continues to be entertaining when he writes entirely '' off his own bat , '' if one may be allowed a colloquialism not at discord with the style of the book under review .


John G. Saxe	PERSON	, in the good old days , rarely did bet - ter work in jocular rhymes than this later dis - peller of our melancholic humours shows himself capable of . ''

		By and Large '' is a worthy succes - sor to '' Toboganning on Parnassus '' and '' In Other Words . ''

		Among the numerous anthological calendars ap - pearing at this season to remind us pleasantly of the opening of another year , a popular favorite is likely to be `` The
William J. Locke	PERSON	Calendar '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , a tastefully made little book with an ex - tract from the author of '' Septimus '' for each day in the year , so selected and arranged by Miss
Emma M. Pope	PERSON	as to give about four of these pearls of thought to the page , but with little attempt to make each fit especially into its part of the entire string .

		But the passages are characteristic of their author , and seem to be carefully and wisely chosen .

		Five tasteful volumes , of pocket size and in good print on good paper and also surprisingly inex - pensive in price contain selections of standard patriotic poems , love poems , sonnets , poems on sport , and religious poems . ''

		Oxford Garlands '' is the series-title , Mr.
R. M. Leonard	PERSON	the compiler , and the imprint is that of the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each volume has a preface , appended notes , an index of authors , and an index of first lines .

		To poetry-lovers these little volumes are a treasure .

		Mr.
George Fitch	PERSON	's original and unexpected way of putting things is agreeably known to thousands of newspaper readers , whom his little syndicated snatches of passing comment have daily amused for the past three years .

		A collection of these `` vestpocket essays -LRB- not especially serious -RRB- '' now appears in book form , under the title , '' Sizing up Uncle Sam '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Its `` Map of the
United States	LOCATION	, surveyed by
George Fitch	PERSON	, '' is not the least of its amusing features .

		The following is a list of all children 's books published during the present season and received at the office of THE DIAL up to the time of going to press with this issue .

		Every well-written novel seems immoral .


Remy de Gourmont	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	contributes '' Some Remarks on American and English Fiction '' to the current issue of '' The Atlantic Monthly '' with manifest doubts as to how his view will be received in this country .

		The editors , in a cautious foot-note , assure the reader that Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	's opinions are his own , and not for a moment to be confused with theirs .

		It is all very curious .

		For there is nothing iconoclastic , nothing daring , nothing unexpected in Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	's article .

		It is true that he `` places '' so many living writers , both English and American , that disagree - ment with him is bound to arise in this or that particular instance .

		But his main contention , which is not so much that English fiction is better than American fiction as that
America	LOCATION	is hostile to individuality , is eminently de - fensible .

		Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	says : '' The dogma put forward under innumerable guises persistently in
America	LOCATION	, that the thinker and the literary artist must cater to the tastes , ideas , and sentiments , moral and emotional , of the great majority under pain of being ignored or ostracized , was noted by De Tocqueville three gen - erations ago , but this dogma bred in the American bone seems to have been reinforced by the latter - day tyranny of the commercial ideal .

		The com - mercial man who says ' read this book because it is the best seller / is seeking to hypnotize the indi - vidual 's judgment and taste .

		If there be a notice - able dearth of originality of feeling and outlook in latter-day American fiction it must be because the individual is subjected from the start to the insis - tent pressure of social ideals of conformity which paralyze or crush out the finer , rarer , more sensi - tive individual talents .

		I do not say that English writers are not vexed in a minor degree by Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	's attempts to boycott or crush novels that offend the taste of ' the villa public , ' but I believe that our social atmosphere favors the writer of true individuality . ''

		It may be possible to argue that the English advantage in this matter is a most uncertain quantity .

		It was an English journalist who reminded us the other day , apropos of the public dinner given to
M. Anatole France	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	, that his countrymen were pleased to honor a master who wrote in French when they would unquestionably have put him in jail for indecency if he had written in En - 492 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	glish .

		It was the English who convicted the translator of
Zola	ORGANIZATION	's novels , was it not ?

		But it is no great matter whether the English are as timid about recognizing the exceptional literary artist as we are , or only less timid .

		There can be no doubt that no civilized nation is any more timid than we of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		We approach all art with a chip on the shoulder , and we call the chip our moral - ity .

		Outside commercial circles our chiefest concern about a work of fiction is whether or not it is immoral .

		There might be something fine , something admirably courageous , in this attitude of ours if it were really morality that we are so strenuous to defend .

		To be anxious about morals is to be anxious about something that men have nobly died for .

		But our anxiety about art is no such high matter .

		It is obvious to the most casual observer that when we speak of morality in connection with art we mean that which is not exceptionable to the ordinary person 's view of life and conduct , and that it is not immorality to which we ob - ject but the unusual , the exceptional .

		Miss
Corinne Bacon	PERSON	, a librarian whose pamphlet on `` What Makes a Novel Immoral '' has enjoyed an unusual circulation , furnishes us with an illustration of this point .

		Miss
Bacon	PERSON	thinks that those novels are immoral which `` appeal to our lower nature , '' which confuse `` right '' and `` wrong , '' and which are `` untrue to life . ''

		As a prime example of the last class Miss
Bacon	LOCATION	cites Mrs. Olive
Schrein	PERSON	- er 's '' The Story of an African Farm , '' which is , she says , characterized by `` leaden pes - simism , '' and Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's `` Jude the Ob - scure , ' ' which deals ,
Miss Bacon	PERSON	believes , with `` abnormal eroticism . ''

		Such novels are un - true to `` the normal life of men and women . ''

		Putting aside the irrelevant question -LRB- if there is any question -RRB- of the value of the two novels mentioned it ought to be obvious that fiction habitually deals with the abnormal and has seldom made so much as a pretense of doing anything else .

		Those novelists who have so passionately defended the ordinary individual as the desirable object of the novel - ist 's art have succeeded in convincing us only where they were able to show us how extraor - dinarily ignorant of the ordinary we are .

		Is it necessary to say that so to deal with the ordinary is only another way of achieving the extraordinary , that is to say , the abnormal ?

		What Miss
Bacon	PERSON	doubtless means to say when she classifies Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	's pessimism as `` morbid '' is that Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	's pes - simism is so much deeper than , or different from , her own as to be unpleasant to her .

		So
Miss Bacon	PERSON	, assuming that her own degree of pessimism is the only truly life-giving and moral degree , decides that Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	's novel is immoral .

		And yet , if
Miss Bacon	LOCATION	is right in believing herself to be healthily bal - anced this side of extreme pessimism what advantage would Miss
Bacon	PERSON	derive from reading any novelist who is equally fortunate ?

		It is plain that , so far as pessimism is con - cerned , only a writer possessed of considerably more than the ideal amount possessed by Miss
Bacon	PERSON	could possibly furnish her with that spiritual adventure which it is the novelist 's business to give .

		But
Miss Bacon	PERSON	, discover - ing such a writer , rejects her novel as im - moral !

		The only answer to
Miss Bacon	LOCATION	's absurdi - ties , which should not occupy us for a moment if they were not so widely held as gospel , is to repeat that a work of art , and none more obviously than the novel , is a personal confes - sion .

		A novel is not an instrument by which we are to see the whole of life , or even a part of it , `` as it really is . ''

		A novel is an invita - tion from a particular individual to look at life for a few hours through his eyes , to see in it what he sees , to feel about it what he feels .

		It is the very fact that his view , his confession , is his , and not ours , that makes it valuable to us .

		Indeed , a novel has value almost in proportion as the confessant 's skill and power have enabled him to make his work the expression of his individuality .

		The nor - mal , or non-individual , person does not exist .

		But the artist is never so much as approxi - mately normal .

		Miss
Bacon	PERSON	is perfectly right in believing that Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	is an abnor - mal woman , though we should prefer to put it less scientifically and call her an altogether exceptional woman .

		Whether the hostility to the exceptional which Mr.
Garnett	PERSON	remarks in us , a hostility almost as great in the case of the artist as in the case of the lunatic , is a permanent at - tribute of our particular democratic experi - ment remains to be seen .

		But we had sup - posed the fact of its existence was so gener - ally known that neither the editors of `` The Atlantic Monthly '' nor any other intelligent observers of the American scene would think of apologizing for publishing it .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , CASUAL COMMENT .

		AMUSEMENT IN STATISTICS might be thought to be about as hard to find as , for instance , grapes on thornbushes , or figs on thistles , or , to change the simile , acute angles in a pentagon , or the square root of a minus quan - tity .

		Nevertheless some little recreation has been derived from a casual examination of library financial reports as presented in a number of current official publications from various free libraries of our country .

		The
Detroit Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, for example , deplores in tearful accents its inability to keep its standard books well bound , and presents a moving picture -LRB- not a cinematograph -RRB- of its ragged regiment of classic authors as they `` lean wearily against each other in their old garments , on the crowded shelves . ' '

		But , ten pages later , this same annual report shows a `` balance on hand '' of
$ 310,219.97	MONEY	, or not far from one-half the total receipts of the year , and almost three-fourths of the total expen - ditures .

		Why this enormous surplus ?

		Or is it possible that we have misread the treas - urer 's figures ?

		A large unexpended balance is always a temptation to all sorts of foolish - ness and worse .

		Voters , too , might with some reason cut down their donation the next year if they find their liberality so little appre - ciated .

		In marked contrast to this unduly economical management of its funds on the part of the
Detroit	LOCATION	library , the report from the Lincoln -LRB-
Nebraska	LOCATION	-RRB- City Library shows total annual receipts of
$ 11,740	MONEY	, and total dis - bursements of
$ 12,429	MONEY	.

		Evidently the man - agement here believes that money is meant to spend , and that it is even wise to spend more than one has .

		A powerful lever on the lid of the city 's strong box is a sturdy , fast - growing , and wholly unabashed annual defi - cit .

		Going a little further afield , we find the
James V. Brown	PERSON	Library of
Williamsport	LOCATION	-LRB-
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	-RRB- sailing so close to the wind that out of receipts amounting to nearly ten thousand dollars it remains with a balance of less than one hundred and
fifty dollars	MONEY	.

		That is not bad management .

		At
Bristol	LOCATION	-LRB- Con - necticut -RRB- , on the other hand , the idle cash reported at the end of the year seems to be about a fifth part of the income not so good management .

		Lack of space forbids further expatiation on this fruitful theme .

		A THWARTED BUT UNDISMAYED LIBRARIAN sounds his note of invincible hopefulness and courage in what , for the present at least , and because of straitened means , must be regarded as the valedictory number of his excellent quarterly bulletin .

		The
Providence Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, under Mr.
William E. Foster	PERSON	's direc - tion , has attracted attention by reason of its intelligent and liberal ministration to the literary needs of its constituency .

		Notable , among other things , is its generous provision of books for its immigrant readers .

		Its current `` Bulletin '' prints in its list of late accessions many titles in languages so com - paratively unfamiliar as Armenian ,
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	, Hungarian , Ruthenian , and Turkish , together with a far greater number in French , German , modern Greek , Italian , Polish , Portuguese , Russian , Spanish , Swedish , and Yiddish .

		And Providence is not exactly a cosmopolitan cen - tre or a very large city .

		But Mr.
Foster	PERSON	regards the things done by himself and his co-workers as nothing to what might be done with larger resources .

		He likens this unful - filment of purpose to the one-time incomplete condition of the
Washington	LOCATION	Monument , but adds : `` In one respect , it is true , this analogy does not hold .

		That is to say , if the residents of
Washington	LOCATION	had been compelled to look on the gradual taking down of some of the stones which had been so painfully raised into posi - tion , their regret would have been all the keener .

		But this is the situation of our read - ers , as they witness the withdrawal of some of the features of library work which it has taken years to attain . ''

		Nevertheless , a brighter dawn will succeed the present gloom , he confidently believes .

		`` Few institutions have represented the hopes , aspirations , and endeavors of so many and so devoted work - ers ; and it would be unthinkable to despair of its ultimate success ; but for the present the outlook is undeniably dark . ' '

		LITTLE LINGUISTIC PECULIARITIES betray the speaker 's or writer 's nationality or even , it may be , the county or the parish where he learned to talk .

		In a large way , Englishmen and Americans speak the same language , but in minor details they have their pet idioms and excite each other 's derision .

		Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	, in his latest contribution to the gaiety of two nations he calls his book `` Round the World in Any Number of Days '' indulges in some remarks on '' the American language , '' as for example : `` Some day , when I have learned the American language properly , I mean to write a large book on the American language .

		In the meantime , the following condensed grammar for foreigners may prove useful for Americans going to
England	LOCATION	, as well as for Englishmen going to
America	LOCATION	: `` Chapter 7 .

		Rule I. -LRB- Very im - portant . -RRB-

		Whenever you say ` in ' in English say either ` on ` or ` to ` in American ... There are one hundred and twenty-six exceptions to 494 THE DTAI , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	this rule , the most important of which is this : `` To be in trouble ' is not translated ` to be on trouble ' in American .

		Rule II .

		The two most important words in American are ` proposition ' and ` stunt . '

		Everything is either a proposition or a stunt .

		There are no other rules . ''

		Prepositions will always cause more or less perplexity and disagreement .

		The Latin scholar will instinctively feel the propriety of saying `` averse from , '' `` in con - trast with / ' `` superiority over , '' and so on , where popular usage is less strict .

		That we do not make sufficient use of in , as is alleged above , is certainly not apparent to us , though we do speak of living on instead of in a street ; but even here we are not unalterably fixed , occasionally using the preposition preferred by our English cousins .

		On the other hand , we object to their being different to us in respect of certain idioms , and their colloquial and even literary use of off -LRB- see Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's writings -RRB- in place of from strikes us as a little unrefined .

		But who would have the whole world speak exactly the same lan - guage ?

		... THE ARROGANCE OF INFERIORITY is a quality not unheard of in critics , and , not least of all , in literary critics .

		If we can not surpass the performances of genius , we can at any rate cry down the genius , which we imagine amounts to the same thing , and is vastly easier .

		In a recent `` Literary Letter '' to the
Springfield	LOCATION	`` Republican , '' Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	takes occasion to comment on this defamatory habit .

		`` This malicious way of estimating good men , '' he says , `` is a poor trait in human nature , coming largely from vanity , to which many small vices may ba ascribed .

		It so pleases the petty human soul to feel itself superior to other human souls , that it almost instinctively misjudges them , especially by hearsay .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	was humorously satirizing the race of men when he stammered out , ` No , I d-don ' t know h-him , but d mn him at a venture . ' '

		After giving some illustrations of this proneness to depre - ciate in sundry book-criticisms , and , among them , a certain reviewer 's malicious assault upon his -LRB- Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	's -RRB- pen-portrait of his old friend , the poet
Ellery Channing	PERSON	, he pro- ceeds : `` It was an instance of that bitter intolerance which is the intellectual sin of
New England	LOCATION	; illustrated in times past by the federalist aspersions on
Jefferson	LOCATION	, by old
J. Q. Adams	PERSON	's fling at
Emerson	LOCATION	, and the elder 1 Professor
Norton	PERSON	's sneer at
Carlyle	LOCATION	and ` the latest form of infidelity . '

		Urbanity is forgot - ten in such exhibitions , or rather is shown to have been omitted from that particular critic 's composition . ''

		It is the young far more than the old who are harshly intolerant in their censure : for , as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	long ago ob - served , we have only to grow old in order to become charitable , since we find in ourselves , if we live long enough , all the faults we have censured in others .

		A PROPOSED BOOK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WARFARE , by a Russian scientist , Dr.
Alexis Maltseff	PERSON	, expert in psychiatry , member of the
Munich Medical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and , until disabled by ague , a participant in the present
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean conflict , is expected to set forth some noteworthy results of the writer 's researches .

		The psychopathic condition of the belligerent and , to some extent , of the neutral nations is certainly a surprising and a painful phe - nomenon .


Europe	LOCATION	, Dr.
Maltseff	PERSON	declares , is in a state of `` bellicose psychosis verging on paranoia , '' and the `` war is more like a mediaeval obsession of the masses than a ra - tional international struggle for power and glory . ' '

		One form taken by the war madness is a persistent and absurd exaggeration of the enemy 's numbers and losses , with correspond - ing magnifying of victories achieved on one 's own side .

		Inability to give anything approach - ing a true account of battle experiences was proved by examination of wounded soldiers in
Moscow	LOCATION	hospitals .

		`` Persistent , uncon - scious lying , '' says Dr.
Maltseff	PERSON	, according to report , `` is one of the first elements of war psychosis .

		It is the fruit of the terror and emotion which every man feels in battle .

		In prolonged actions the rank and file and the fighting officers do not know what they do . ''

		Fearful indeed is the prospect of what will follow after the war is over , if this authority is to be credited .

		So demoralizing is war , even to those who only read about it , in the newspapers , that a wave of crime will sweep over the world after the tempest now raging shall have subsided .

		`` There will be a reac - tion against discipline and privation on the part of the disbanded reservists , '' and other things frightful to contemplate even as re - mote possibilities .

		But , with all due respect to Dr.

		PEACE THROUGH SPELLING-REFORM is the theme of an earnest editorial in `` The Pioneer of Simplified Speling . ' '

		Not to weaken in the least degree the force of the appeal , we quote a few sentences in the writer 's own `` speling . ''

		He says of the reform : `` We hav aulwaiz held that it woz a faktor which must be taiken intu akount in eni thuroegoing pees propa - ganda .

		Brij over the speech barier , sielens

Babel	LOCATION	, bring the peeplz ov diferent nashonalitiz intu the intimait rela - shonship ov the spoeken wurd , and yu hav gon mor than a step or tuu on the paath of yuniversal brutherhood . ''

		But it is admit - ted that the present clash of arms can hardly be silenced by a mere revision of the diction - ary ; the full effect of spelling-reform as a universal peace-maker can not be felt until existing discords have been somewhat har - monized .

		`` But when ` this wurld-madness haz been eksorsiezd ' ; when aul the haitful noizez ov worfair ar murjd in that luvli karesing wurd ` pees , ' then wil kum the dai for such muuvments az ourz . ''

		After four months and a half of nightmare , even those who are strongly anti-reform in their orthog - raphy would doubtless be willing , in order to secure a lasting peace , to spell the word `` pees , '' or `` peas , '' or even `` pease , '' hence - forth and for ever .

		BOOKS WITH WHICH TO BECOME SATURATED , in order to acquire a good English style in writing , need not be many in number ; in fact they may be surprisingly few , and prob - ably , if a style at once simple and clear and vigorous is desired , the fewer the better .

		One single book , the English Bible , as has often been remarked , will supply all that is neces - sary in the above-named qualities , and many rhetorical graces besides .

		Lincoln knew his Bible from cover to cover , and next to that he had an enviable acquaintance with Shake - speare ; and what a master he was with the pen and in spoken utterance !

		Dr.
Talcott Williams	PERSON	, addressing the
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	stu - dents recently , urged those who contemplated entering his profession -LRB- journalism -RRB- to study diligently and incessantly both the
Bible	LOCATION	and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, until `` saturated with their thought and expression . ''

		A good writer , he further pointed out , `` must possess facility , confidence , and a sense of style .

		He should realize that there is a best way to say every - thing , and should not stop till he has found that way . ''

		To his excellent advice always to begin an article with the not least important part of what one has to say , he might have added the counsel to end it with something equally attention-compelling to avoid the too-common practice of ' ' tapering off . ' '

		COMMUNICATION .

		THE '' CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Another irritating instance of the `` conspiracy of silence , '' similar to the one described in THE DIAL of
November 16	DATE	, is .

		the case of Graf von Loeben -LRB- 1786-1825 -RRB- .

		He wrote and published about as many works as did , say ,
Heine	LOCATION	, distributed as fol - lows : one conventional drama ; one musical-roman - tic drama ; '' Guido , '' a novel of 360 pages ; about thirty-seven novelettes ; four volumes of poems , some of which are excellent as to content , the great majority of which are superb as to form ; several thousand aphorisms ; a good commentary to
Madame de Stael	ORGANIZATION	's '' De 1 ` Allemagne '' ; about sixty reviews ; and a long list of letters , many of which are direct contributions to literary criticism .

		In addition , he left a number of unpublished frag - ments , including the outline of a pretentious novel of which
Heinrich von Veldeke	PERSON	was to be the hero .

		He translated from
Ariosto	LOCATION	,
Dante	LOCATION	,
Guarini	PERSON	, Hor - ace ,
Ovid	LOCATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, and
Virgil	PERSON	.

		Finally , he was an editor of repute .

		As a man he seems to have left nothing to be desired .

		Professor
Muncker	PERSON	says '' er war eine scheme
Seele	PERSON	in des Wortes schonster Bedeutung . ''

		He influenced Eichendorff and Platen , and many contend that his ballad on the
Lorelei	PERSON	was the immediate inspiration of
Heine	PERSON	in his composition on the same subject .

		Fouque called him '' a poet by the Grace of God , '' while
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is credited with the remark that '' er war der vorziiglichste
Dichter	PERSON	jener Zeit . ''

		Many of the operas on the
Lorelei	LOCATION	are said to have owed their origin to his saga in prose on the same subject .

		And yet , the compendious ''
Konversations	PERSON	-
Lexikon	ORGANIZATION	'' of Meyer and
Brockhaus	PERSON	is silent on him , unless it be in the discussion of some of the numerous poets with whom he associated .

		Of the twenty best known histories of German literature , some of which treat the nineteenth century exclu - sively , only six contain his name , and these simply mention him as the friend of some one else .

		We do not wish to have Graf von Loeben revived : there are too many unread poets now .

		His poems are , for example , good , but not so good as those of
Riickert	LOCATION	, and no one has read all of Riickert .

		To study
Loeben	PERSON	for his own sake would be to set up false values .

		But since these wordy manuals list so many little , petty writers and poets , they might also include
Graf von Loeben	PERSON	.

		It is perhaps a case of group psychology in letters , rather than a conspiracy of silence .

		Loeben was not quite good enough to last after he died .

		He has not been studied .

		It would be diffi - cult to write on him in an encyclopaedia ; it has n't been done .

		But let some one do it once , and then every succeeding encyclopaedia will have an article on this obscure but prolific poet , this influential man .

		It is not easy to make a poorer investment than is made in the buying of the average encyclopaedia .

		It contains , despite the oratory of the agent , huge stores of information that never concern us , so that these volumes simply clutter up our desks , and as to the few subjects in which we are espe - cially interested , the information is always and without exception deficient in quantity , and many times warped and unreasoned , handed-down and saved-over as to quality .

M. Guerin	PERSON	on the shore of the Golden Gate in
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- turns the attention of our travelling public from war-ridden
Europe	LOCATION	to our own
Riviera	LOCATION	.

		American publishers , au - thors , and artists have anticipated the de - mand for informing and helpful books on
California	LOCATION	, and have produced a notable array of interesting and instructive works which set forth the
Golden State	ORGANIZATION	in various aspects scenic , historical , political , and naturalistic .

		It is noteworthy that two of
California	LOCATION	's fore - most novelists , Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	and Mrs.
Ather	PERSON	- ton , have turned their pens to this field of descriptive exploration to meet the demands of the exposition year .

		And well they might , for the theme in any aspect is rich in interest and dramatic in setting .

		Foremost among these books in beauty of conception and execution is Mr.
Sutton Palmer	PERSON	's and Mrs.
Mary Austin	PERSON	's `` Califor - nia , the Land of the Sun . ''

		It is a sincere and studied effort to convey to the uninitiated reader something of the charm of the land - scape , the brilliant atmosphere , the smil - ing valleys , blooming mesas , waving fields , fruitful orchards , stately forests , and tower - ing snow-clad mountain peaks of Califor - nia .

		The two collaborators use different mediums to convey their ideas but they speak one language .

		Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	's text carries the reader northward from
San Diego	LOCATION	, through
Los Angeles	LOCATION	-LRB- with its `` mothering moun - tains '' -RRB- up the coast through
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	and its mission to
Carmel	LOCATION	and
Monterey	ORGANIZATION	, with its beautiful cypresses , to the

		Witness the charm - ing chapter on `` Old Spanish Gardens '' : `` A Spanish garden is a very intimate affair .

		It is the innermost undergarment of the family life .

		Dona
Ina	ORGANIZATION	's was walled away from the world by six feet of adobe , around the top of which still lingered the red tiles of Mission manufacture .

		It was not spoken of as the garden at all , it was the patio , an integral part of the dwelling .

		There was , in fact , a raw-hide cot on the long gallery which gave access to it , and
Dona Ina	ORGANIZATION	's drawn - work chemises bleaching in the sun .

		The patio is a gift to us from
Andalusia	LOCATION	. ''

		One would hardly expect the exactness of a geographical work or the completeness of
Bae	ORGANIZATION	- deker in this poetical tribute to the land of sunshine , but one can hardly forgive the omis - sion of
Oakland	LOCATION	, the third city of the state , from the map and of
Palo Alto	LOCATION	and
Berkeley	LOCATION	, the intellectual capitals of the commonwealth , from all reference in the text .

		And it is a curiously critical and partial interpretation of the bracing and invigorating climate of
San Francisco	LOCATION	which the author ventures : '' The very worst location in the world , this windy promontory past which the grey tides race , but so long as a city can dramatise itself , one situation will do as well as another in which to render itself immortal . ''

		The `` larg - est of the true pines '' -LRB- p. 152 -RRB- is not Pinus monticola but rather the giant sugar pine Lamb
$ rtiana	MONEY	, and the island of
Santa Rosa	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 12 -RRB- faces
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	, not
San Diego	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Sutton Palmer	PERSON	's part in the work consists of thirty-two beautiful colored plates repro - duced from paintings representative of the choicest bits of
California	LOCATION	's landscape .

		In selection of themes and in composition they leave little to be desired , and as a whole they give an excellent impression of the wonderful variety and the striking contrasts of the scen - ery of
California	LOCATION	.

		But they are disappoint - ing in some particulars , possibly as a result of losses in execution by the three-color proc - ess .

		Mount Tamalpais , for example , lacks any suggestion of the brilliancy it shows at its best , and the
Mill Valley	ORGANIZATION	plate quite fails to reveal the
Marin Hills	LOCATION	.

		The printer has evi - dently overworked the red tones in most of the plates and reduced too much the colors of the other end of the spectrum .

		A series of charming essays on the trees , flowers , and fruits of
California	LOCATION	from the facile pen of an enthusiastic lover of the out - of-doors is to be found in Mr.
Charles Francis Saunders	PERSON	's `` With the Flowers and Trees in
California	LOCATION	. ''

		The `` Land of Sunshine '' is so full of novelties of the plant world , both of its own and of those adopted from even the
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 497 remotest corners of the earth , which find a congenial home in its equable climate ren - dered even more acceptable by irrigation , that the inquisitive lover of floAvers from the
East	LOCATION	has many queries to make as soon as the gates of the mountains are passed .


Spain	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
South Africa	LOCATION	, and the isles of the sea have all contributed to the brilliant array of bloom and foliage which adorns the parks and roadways and buries the bungalows in billows of bloom .

		In this book one may find first-hand knowledge of the flowers , trees , and shrubbery of the deserts , the mesas , the forests , the gardens , and the varied orchards of this land where nature is lavish and the hand of man ingenious to provoke her to burst into bloom .

		The book is far from being a dry scientific catalogue , as Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	has managed to weave into its pages a great deal of descriptive matter about native and intro - duced plants and historical lore concerning the early botanical explorers ,
Douglas	PERSON	, Cham - isso ,
Menzies	PERSON	,
Eschscholtz	LOCATION	, and
Nuttall	PERSON	.

		The human interest of plants plays a large part in his treatment .

		He is interested to know what plants came overland in the immigrant cara - vans , what herbs were used by the Indian , the sources of the fibres chosen by the basket - weaver , the fruits , flowers , and vegetables of the old Mission gardens and ranch patios , and the characteristic flowers of the gardens of to - day .

		The ` accounts ; of the blooming of the 5 mesa and of the botanical riches of the desert are charming bits of descriptive natural history .

		It is to be regretted that so little of the for - ests and of the mountain flora of the north - ern part of the state receives the notice it so well deserves in these pages .

		We note that the
Washington	LOCATION	palm is called , by oversight , `` pine '' -LRB- plate facing p. 10 -RRB- , and that the consonant-rich name of
Eschscholtz	LOCATION	, god - father of the
California	LOCATION	poppy , is -LRB- p. 105 -RRB- robbed of one of its consonants .

		All lovers of nature who seek refreshment out-of-doors in
California	LOCATION	will find Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	's book a delightful companion and a never failing re - minder of
California	LOCATION	's greatest charms .

		A plea for the immediate conservation of the sources of
Pacific	LOCATION	coast history in the form of original materials not yet in the safe keep - ing of historical archives is the occasion of Mr.
John F. Davis	PERSON	's ``
California	LOCATION	Romantic and Resourceful . ''

		This brochure contains in revised and expanded form his Admission Day address descriptive of the past of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia , ' ' which possesses a wealth of romantic interest , a variety of contrast , a novelty of resourcefulness and an intrinsic importance which enthralls the imagination . ''

		There is added the address on the occasion of placing of the bronze tablet upon the oldest adobe building in
San Francisco	LOCATION	to mark the birth - place of
Concha Arguello	PERSON	, the heroine of one of the most tragic love stories of the world .

		For it was here that the radiant and bewitch - ing Conchita was wooed and won by the ad - venturous and resolute
Nicolai Petrovich Resanoff	PERSON	, Russian chamberlain , explorer , and advance agent of the Slavic civilization that reached in
1806	DATE	southward from
Alaska	LOCATION	even to the
Golden Gate	ORGANIZATION	.


Bret Harte	PERSON	's poetic `` Conception de Arguello '' is reproduced with extended critical and historical annota - tions to complete the setting of this incident .

		Had the fates vouchsafed a happy conclusion instead of the tragic death of the lover in the heart of
Siberia	LOCATION	, on his way to secure at
Madrid	LOCATION	royal sanction for this international alliance , history might even now be writing a different story of Slav expansion .


Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	characterized the
United States	LOCATION	as a '' songful , tuneful land and if the new Homer shall arise from the western Continent , his verse will be enriched , his pages sing spontaneously , with the names of states and cities that would strike the fancy in a business circular . ''


California	LOCATION	has her full share and more of tuneful names , thanks to the period of Spanish settlement and to the Indian nomenclature that still lingers in her valleys and mountains to add a touch of ro - mance not wholly free from sadness .

		These names have survived in considerable number in spite of the misdirected efforts at abbre - viation and foreshortening on the part of economically inclined postal officials .

		They tend to increase with the growth of settle - ments , due to the zeal of real-estate boom - ers who seek to capitalize the romantic past .

		Not all of the word-coinage of the `` Spaniards from
Kansas	LOCATION	'' would pass the critical inspec - tion of one familiar with the mellifluent tongue of the padres : witness such crudities : as
Rio Vista	LOCATION	for the longer but infinitely more pleasing
Vista del Rio	ORGANIZATION	.


Madame Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez	ORGANIZATION	has rendered a real service to all those , and they are many , to whom the Spanish tongue is a closed book , by compiling a list of '' Spanish and Indian Place Names of
California	LOCATION	'' and annotating the citations with a running comment of gossipy informa - tion as to their meaning and origin .

		Much of local Spanish and Indian history and tradi - tion is woven into these seemingly disjointed notes .

		The arrangement is geographical , thus facilitating use by the tourist en route , gen - erally , from
San Diego	LOCATION	northward , more or less along the line of the old Mission Camino Real .

		An alphabetical list in which are gath - ered all scattered place names of interest THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	completes the work , which will be of perma - nent value to travellers as well as a reference work in libraries and schools .

		A series of cuts from some early source , unfortunately not named , portrays the Spanish Missions ; other illustrations are from recent photographs .

		That the Indians ever did much `` fishing in teeming streams '' -LRB- p. 26 -RRB- in
Southern California	LOCATION	where the rivers run `` upside down '' is very doubtful .

		The chem - ical metaphor in the phrase -LRB- p. 6 -RRB- `` when put to the acid test of such investigation , melt into thin air '' is somewhat mixed .

		But these are minor defects in a very useful , attractive , and well-written book .

		Mrs.
Gertrude AthertonV	PERSON
California	LOCATION	: An Intimate History '' reveals an historian gifted with a keen sense of the dramatic , a pene - trating power of analyzing the springs of human action , and a virile forcefulness and freedom of expression .

		These are qualities which make history at least attractive , how - ever much they may bias the historian 's selec - tion and treatment of material .


California	LOCATION	's past abounds in dramatic incidents from the days of the zealous padres of the Spanish Missions to the now projected graft trials .

		It scintillates with picturesque characters from the zealous Father
Junipero Serra	PERSON	, the dash - ing Rezanoff , the indomitable
Coleman	PERSON	, the ill-fated
Broderick	PERSON	, the rampant
Kearny	LOCATION	, to the forceful
Heney	LOCATION	.

		The author has utilized these abundant materials , so full of human interest , to weave a dramatic story of striking incidents which portray the fitful and chang - ing life of a great state , which more than any other in the
Union	ORGANIZATION	embodies in its history the fateful tragedies of the frontier .

		Her history is a personal and political one , cast in dra - matic mould and illumined by word pictures from the trained hand of the novelist : '' That long chain of snow-white red-tiled mis - sions , hedged with Castilian roses , surrounded with olive-orchards , whose leaves were silver in the sun , orange groves heavy with golden fruit , the vast sweep of shimmering grain-fields broken by stately oaks , winding rivers set close with the tall pale cottonwoods , lakes with the long branches of willows trailing over the surface , bounded by for - est and mountain and sea , and not a city to break the harmony , must have been the fairest sight in the modern world . '' ''

		Father Fr .


Junipero Serra	PERSON	may have failed to reap the great harvest of Indian souls he had bap - tized with such gratitude and exultation , and that consoled him for all his afflictions , but he lifted
California	LOCATION	from the unread pages of geological history and placed it on the modern map .

		I won - der what he thinks of it . ''

		It is a story of men and an analysis of their motives rather than an account of the great movements in national and international affairs which have found expression in the life of the state .

		It is perhaps for this rea - son and because of her preference for the dra - matic that her only attempt to portray the intellectual , educational , literary , and artistic life of the state is to be found in an all too brief catalogue of intellectual worthies of
California	LOCATION	in a fine print appendix .

		In like manner the industrial and commercial his - tory , rich as it is with its relations to the fur-trade , the fisheries , the Orient ,
Hawaii	LOCATION	,
Alaska	LOCATION	, and the South seas , to the mines , irri - gation , fruit culture , and hydro-electric devel - opment , is left by our author for another CHARLES ATWOOD KOFOID .

		1STEW MEMOIRS OF
CHARLES STEWART PARXELL	PERSON	, .

		* In the memorable month of
July , 1914	DATE	, the movement for the repeal of the
Act of Union	ORGANIZATION	between
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, which O'Con - nell organized more than seventy years ago , saw at least a partial triumph .

		The new machinery of government provided by the Home Rule Act has not yet been set in motion ; but the law is on the statute books and the enemies of home rule will probably not be able to repeal the act or modify it in any important respect .

		The
Asquith	PERSON	measure is not , per - haps , what
O'Connell	PERSON	and his followers had hoped for : it does not give independence to the Irish people ; but while
Ireland	LOCATION	continues to be a part of the Empire and the Kingdom , the new law gives the island its own legislature with a large measure of authority over Irish affairs .

		The ideas that were enacted into law in the third home rule bill were not those of
O'Connell	PERSON	; they were developed by one who in leadership and statesmanship was far greater than the `` Liberator '' from
Kerry	PERSON	,
Charles Stewart Parnell	PERSON	.

		The long debates on this proposition both within and without parliament naturally turned popular attention to the history of the man who first made the Irish question a serious issue in British politics .

		Two memoirs of this remarkable man have recently come from the press : one by his brother , Mr.
John Howard Parnell	PERSON	, and another by Mrs.
Katha	PERSON	- rine `
Shea	PERSON	, whom
Parnell	PERSON	married in the last year of his life , but with whom he had stood on a footing of close intimacy for ten years *

		CHARLES
STEWART PARNELL	PERSON	: His Love Story and Political Life .

		By
Katharine O'Shea	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Charles Stewart Parnell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL , before .

		These works are in no sense of the word biographies ; Mr.
John Howard Parnell	PERSON	appears to have made no researches except in his own memory ; and
Katharine O'Shea	PERSON	-LRB- such is the name given on the title page -RRB- , though she publishes a large number of let - ters , has apparently used no documents except such as she has found in her own possession .

		The student who turns to these letters in the hope of getting new light on Parn ell 's politi - cal life will be disappointed : the letters are interesting but not very informing ; they are brief , often very brief , and fervid notes from a man to a woman who ruled his affections , and as a rule do not deal with public affairs except in a very vague manner .

		The follow - ing , dated at
Dublin	LOCATION	,
September 25 , 1881	DATE	, is almost typical of the collection : '' My own Loveliest , I send you these few words to assure Wine that her husband always thinks of her and hopes that she is well and happy .

		Your Own King . ''

		It is difficult to understand in what way the publication of such letters will serve the cause of English or Irish history .

		It is true , however , that the letters written during certain important periods of
Parnell	ORGANIZATION	's career have a somewhat greater interest for the student of history .

		Such are the letters written from
Kilmainham	LOCATION	jail in
1881	DATE	and
1882	DATE	, of which the first one contains this sig - nificant statement : '' Politically it is a fortunate thing for me that I have been arrested , as the movement is breaking fast , and all will be quiet in a few months , when I shall be released . ''

		The letters included in the chapter on the ``
Kilmainham	LOCATION	treaty '' between the Irish lead - ers and the
Gladstone	PERSON	government are also of considerable importance .

		It is in connection with this treaty that Mrs.
O'Shea	PERSON	first ap - pears as a factor in Irish politics .

		As memoirs written by persons who knew the `` inscrutable ''
Parnell	PERSON	as he was in pri - vate life , these volumes will have some value for future biographers .

		The importance of Mr.
John Howard Parnell	PERSON	's `` Memoir '' lies chiefly in the earlier chapters which deal with the life of his eminent brother before he en - tered a public career ; to our knowledge of
Parnell	ORGANIZATION	's political character the author adds almost nothing .

		Mrs.
O'Shea	PERSON	professes to tell
Parnell	PERSON	's `` love story and political life '' ; but her book is for the most part a biography of herself .

		Mrs.
` Shea	PERSON	was the daughter of an English clergyman , and we gather from her narrative that she was a capable , clever , and attractive woman .

		In
1867	DATE	she married Cap - tain
William ` Shea	PERSON	, a young Irish aristocrat .

		The ` Sheas do not seem to have been very congenial : the wife was unconventional in her attitude toward the world and the hus - band was a failure in almost everything that he undertook .

		After an experience as a breeder of fast horses which brought him far on the road toward bankruptcy , the young captain found himself with nothing to do and with no adequate source of income : ''
Willie	PERSON	was now longing for some definite occupa - tion , and he knew many political people .

		While he was on a visit to
Ireland	LOCATION	early in
1880	DATE	he was constantly urged by his friends , the O'Donnells and others , to try for a seat in the next parliament ... '' Mr.
O'Shea	PERSON	feared that his want of money would make it impossible for him to be a can - didate , but his wife urged `` him to stand , for I knew it would give him occupation he liked and keep us apart and therefore good friends . ''

		Captain
O'Shea	PERSON	was elected , t and to promote his political fortunes his wife be - gan to cultivate the friendship of
Charles Stewart Parnell	PERSON	, the unquestioned leader of the Irish forces .

		This was in
1880	DATE	, and from that time
Parnell	PERSON	was a frequent visitor at the home of the O ` Sheas .

		Mrs.
O'Shea	PERSON	seems to have been more than a friend or a mere mistress : she claims to have become
Parnell	PERSON	's political secretary and an accepted intermediary between him and the government .

		This may have been of some advantage to her ' ' king , ' ' but the relationship also had its embarrassments ; at one time when Captain
O'Shea	PERSON	was in danger of failing to secure a seat in parliament ,
Parnell	PERSON	found it necessary almost to compel a reluctant con - stituency to give him a seat .

		Though the student of history will find but little in these volumes that he can not obtain elsewhere , he will , if he is interested in prob - lems of personal and political ethics , find much of interest in them .

		There is first of all the author 's relationship to
Parnell	PERSON	: `` And because
Parnell	PERSON	contravened certain social laws , not regarding them as binding him in any way , and because I joined him in this contraven - tion since his love made all else of no account to me , we did not shrink at the clamour of the up - holders of those outraged laws , nor resent the pressing of the consequences that were inevitable and always foreseen . ''

		SJie wishes us to believe that the relationship was an honorable one ; and yet the narrative shows clearly that for a decade she was com - pelled to lead a life of constant deception .

		And when
Parnell	PERSON	's child was born , in
1882	DATE	, Captain
O'Shea	PERSON	believed that the child was his and hoped that its birth might bring about a complete reconciliation .

		The narrative leads one to feel that neither
Katharine ` Shea	PERSON	's relationship to her husband nor her relation - 500 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	ship to her lover was particularly sacred .

		It would seem that her version of
Parnell	PERSON	's `` love story '' adds , if possible , to the guilt that the world has imputed to him since it was made public in
1890	DATE	.

		Mr.
John Howard Parnell	PERSON	barely mentions Mrs.
O'Shea	PERSON	and has very little to say about this part of his brother 's life .

		Without at - tempting to defend his brother , he states the belief of the family that Captain
O'Shea	PERSON	was '' a false friend of Charley 's , and simply waiting his time to strike a fatal blow .

		... As far as our family was concerned , we were unanimous in re - garding the institution of proceedings at this time as being due to a political plot , having for its object the ruin of Charley . ''

		If it was a plot , the plot succeeded , for the ruin was complete , as Mrs.
O'Shea	PERSON	found to her great chagrin a few weeks later .

		The most startling part of Mrs.
` Shea	PERSON	's book is the charge that the Liberal * chiefs and especially
Gladstone	PERSON	, who threw
Parnell	PERSON	over - board after the court had acted in the divorce suit , had known about
Parnell	PERSON	's love for Mrs.
O'Shea	PERSON	and had even accepted his mistress as a sort of confidential agent in dealing with the Irish party : '' For ten - years
Gladstone	PERSON	had known of the rela - tions between
Parnell	PERSON	and myself , and had taken full advantage of the facility this intimacy offered him in keeping in touch with the Irish leader .

		Whether

MR. G. LOWES	PERSON	DICKIXSOX ox EAST AND WEST .

		* The most serious danger in a trip around the world is neither shipwreck , nor disease , but the temptation to write a book .

		Even fasting and prayer seem of little avail against this particular onslaught of the Enemy of Man .

		During the months of travel any un - spoiled wayfarer , with ordinary intelligence and reasonable mental equipment , finds him - self so delightfully refreshed , so intensely interested , so stimulated to fertile reflection , that it seems almost a sin not to write a book and thus share with the world the benefit of his impressions and experiences .

		But sober thought should recall that the seaways of literature are dotted with boresome unread volumes , which ought to warn us of this peril of the deep .

		Naturally , our experienced essayist has not escaped such thoughts , nor does he present his little book without mis - givings : `` In reprinting them -LSB- articles from the `` Manchester Guardian '' and the `` En - glish Review '' -RSB- I have chosen a title which may serve also as an apology .

		What I offer is not Reality , but appearances to me . ' '

		How - ever , the solicitations of friends and editors , with the seductive opportunity of contrasting East and West , proved too strong for our literary wayfarer , who had been enjoying a
Kahn	PERSON	fellowship , and he succumbed .

		On the whole , we must be glad he did , although we do not feel that his present offering is quite as valuable as some of its predecessors so warmly reviewed in these columns .

		Of course Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	could not perpe - trate a book of the ordinary ' ' travel and place type , '' and does not fill his pages with hack - neyed descriptions of familiar scenes .

		Udai - pur and
Agra	LOCATION	, for instance , are not even men - tioned , while
Niagara	ORGANIZATION	serves merely as an occasion for recording a delightful , if imagi - nary , conversation .

		But even our veteran litterateur does not quite escape the curse of the globe-trotter , for he wastes one chapter on the mongrel Malay theatre at Penang and another on a commonplace treatment of Peking .

		We could almost wish that the writer of `` Letters of a Chinese Official '' had never seen
China	LOCATION	, although there is good reading in `` A Sacred Mountain '' and `` In the Yangtse Gorges . ' '

		When he reaches
Japan	LOCATION	, he is captivated at once , as all of us are captivated ; but
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	has been described and anatomized and eulo - gized and berated so often during the
last two decades	DATE	that it is almost impossible to * APPEARANCES .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 501 attain a new point of view or offer your read - ers any fresh pabulum .

		However , the papers on `` First Impressions of
Japan	LOCATION	`` and `` Fuji '' are genuinely enjoyable .

		When he turns to write of ``
Japan	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' he finds most of us prepared to share his feeling that `` patience and sympathy '' are sadly lacking among the Californians , and to concede , even to enlarge upon , the many good qualities of the Japanese .

		But why should he insist that the `` morals '' of that attractive people are probably higher than those of
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	?

		Surely he must give `` morals '' a new and elaborate definition , if he is to carry his point .

		But obviously we may not wander in this spirit of enjoyment or criticism through the whole volume , so we hasten to say that its real value for us must be sought in the chap - ters on
America	LOCATION	and in the author 's reflec - tions on the differences between East and
West	LOCATION	.

		Now his general attitude toward our land is kindly .

		In a spirit of unnecessary but gen - tlemanly apology he expresses regret for a tone of exasperation in his comments on us ; but his irritation and his expression thereof are mild and ladylike and courtly compared with the violent wrath and indignant stric - tures of many of our homeborn critics .

		Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	believes that the vision of
America	LOCATION	is the vision of the lighting up of the millions , and that herein lies
America	LOCATION	's great contribu - tion to civilization ; but it is not what he comes across in his experience .

		And there is the point .

		It is so easy for a visitor to see our perfectly obvious failures ; it is so impos - sible to perceive what we are really doing .

		We do make a hopeless muddle of many things , to our own constant and bitter grief ; but we do dream and we do try .

		We are too keen about money ; but money is no more powerful in
America	LOCATION	than in
England	LOCATION	, or
Germany	LOCATION	, assert it who will ; and it is absurd to say that `` no American youth of ambition leaves college with any less or greater purpose in his heart than that of emulating Mr. Car - negie or Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	. ''

		Our poor col - leges and universities are open to no end of perfectly just criticism ; but they are the best antidotes the country has to the
Carnegie	LOCATION	-
Rockefeller	ORGANIZATION	ideal of success .

		Again , we agree with our author that comment on most of our
Sunday	DATE	newspapers is quite superfluous ; but it would have been only fair to add that , despite all its palpable faults , the American press has often been the agent of tremendous good .

		However , it is well to have the tonic truth told us as often as possible , and there is no need to smear the rim of the bitter medicinal cup with the honey of compliment .

		And yet , Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	has missed
America	LOCATION	.

		His graceful and forceful comments are wel - come and helpful ; but he himself has not yet discovered us .

		We are seen at our truest in our educational striving , for all its un - bounded failure ; and if our
Cambridge	LOCATION	economist had spent a large part of his time in studying our schools and colleges , he would still have had countless strictures to pass , but he would have come much nearer understand - ing our dream and our efforts than by wan - dering about like a thousand other intelligent visitors among the things that any eyes can see .

		And whatever else anybody may discover in our variegated
United States	LOCATION	we should like to know where Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	made sure that the predominant physical type is `` the great jaw and chin , the huge teeth and preda - tory mouth . ''

		We may sacrifice beauty and distinction to force in our speech as in our politics ; we may be capable of living and acting only in masses ; we may have abso - lutely no culture , although we honestly be - lieve we have seen gleams thereof ; it may be fair to accuse us of everything from super - ficiality to money-grubbing ; but we must pro- test against that great jaw and chin , those huge teeth , and that predatory mouth , as a basis of our national physiognomy .

		Surely the misfortune of individuals must not be translated into a racial calamity .

		Moreover , it is to be hoped that this sentence of con - demnation he passes will not come into the hands of any well-trained anthropologists , for they would justly flay him alive on purely scientific grounds .

		Of the general contrast he draws between East and West , we may give only this inade - quate summary .

		There is a West , in a real sense , with a unity of its own ; but it must be limited in time to the last two centuries and in space to the countries of
Western Europe	LOCATION	and the continent of
America	LOCATION	.

		He is not quite so sure that there is an East ; for
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	are distinctly different from
India	LOCATION	.

		And in fact he ultimately takes only the last named country as the opposite of his West .

		In his East , thus circumscribed , the great feature is the `` religion of Eternity , '' which proposes as its end , not the living of temporal life in a particular spirit , but the transcend - ing of it by a special experience and the com - ing into union with the Infinite .

		`` Life is an evil ; and the escape is either , for the masses , by death , or , for the men of spiritual genius , by a flight to the Eternal . ' '

		502 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	And now we may quote the confession of faith he has put on the lips of the West : '' I believe in the ultimate distinction between Good and Evil , and in a real process in a real Time .

		I believe it to be my duty to increase Good and diminish Evil ; I believe that in doing this I am serving the purpose of the world .

		I know this ; I do not know anything else ; and I am reluctant to put questions to which I have no answer , and to which I do not believe that anyone has an answer .

		Action , as defined above , is my creed .

		Speculation weakens action .

		I do not wish to speculate , I wish to live .

		And I believe the true life to be the life I have described . ''

		Naturally , however , he realizes that many Western men have a place for the Eternal and the Infinite , and he is willing to modify his antithesis slightly by wording it : In
India	LOCATION	, the emphasis is on the Eternal ; in the West , on
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		For himself he is quite clearly and definitely on the side of the latter : '' I have said in the preceding pages hard things about Western civilization .

		I hate many of its manifestations , I am out of sympathy with many of its purposes .

		I can see no point , for instance , in the discovery of the north or the south pole , and very little in the invention of aeroplanes ; while gramophones , machine guns , advertisements , cinematographs , submarines , dreadnoughts , cos - mopolitan hotels , seem to me merely fatuous or sheerly disastrous .

		But what lies behind all this , the tenacity , the courage , the spirit of adventure , this it is that is the great contribution of the
West	LOCATION	.

		It is not the aeroplane that is valuable ; probably it will never be anything but pernicious , for its main use is likely to be for war .

		But the fact that men so lightly risk their lives to perfect it , that is valuable .

		The West is adventurous ; and , what is more , it is adventurous on a quest .

		For behind and beyond all its fatuities , confusions , crimes , lies , as the justification of it all , that deep deter - mination to secure a society more just and more humane , which inspires all men and all movements that are worth considering at all , and to those who can understand , gives greatness and significance even to some of our most reckless enterprises .

		We are living very ' dangerously ' ; all the forces are loose , those of destruction as well as those of crea - tion ; but we are living towards something ; we are living with the religion of Time . ''

		After the criticisms we have been bold enough to pass on this delightful little vol - ume , it is a pleasure to close with such a char - acteristically thoughtful passage .

		Occasion - ally the book must move a serious reader to almost impatient repudiation ; much more often it will evoke his sympathy and ap - proval ; and always it will command his respect for its sanity and seriousness of atti - tude , his admiration for its lucidity and gracefulness of style .

		BALZAC AXD FLAUBERT .

		*
M. Emile Faguet	PERSON	is no less vigorous , direct , and unsparing as a critic of the French novel than as a critic of the French democracy , though readers of `` The Cult of Incompe - tence '' and `` The Dread of Responsibility '' will not find it hard to believe that he is somewhat more patient with the former ; for , while he writes in both fields as the believer in aristocracy and the enemy of demagoguery , the temptation to laughter and scorn is less likely to interfere with judicial sobriety when he is dealing with literary art than when he is contemplating the crowd .

		`` An admirable literary workman , upright , conscientious , scrupulous , and arduous , '' he says of
Balzac	LOCATION	, in the critical study now trans - lated for the English and American public .

		`` He is of those who have deserved , even on moral grounds , both worldly success and last - ing fame . ''

		In the clear thinking and or - derly method which distinguish his work ,
M. Faguet	PERSON	brings into strong relief Balzac 's attractive qualities both as a person and a novelist his vigor and good-nature , his frankness , his generosity , his genius for the creation of lifelike and powerful characters .

		But he makes to stand out in still stronger relief the great novelist 's limitations his lack of either personal or moral distinction , to say nothing of delicacy , his profound egotism , the slightness of his intellectual culture , his want of familiarity with all except one section of the great social world he was ambitious to portray in its entirety in the grandiosely con - ceived `` Comedie Humaine , '' the frequent and garrulous interpolation of his own loose thinking in the business of the narrative , the mixing of base romanticism and brutal real - ism , the coarseness of his nature and his taste , the unreliability of his genius : '' He had not genius all the time .

		... A whole literature grew up out of
Balzac	LOCATION	's cesspools ... He is responsible for all the easy-going and damnable audacity of all the novel-writers who pretend to believe that realism lies in the study of sinister or shameful abnormality ... Ready - made romanticism , coarse realism are the two things which spoil Balzac 's work , the former very much and the latter a little .

		What spoils nearly the whole of it is the vulgarity that was inherent in the man 's nature and crept into nearly every - thing he did . ''

		M. Faguet 's explanation of
Balzac	LOCATION	's suc - cess is a long way from being unreservedly complimentary either to the novelist or to his * BALZAC .

		1914 -RSB- THE DIAL 503 readers .

		It was his very faults that made him popular : '' But , if it be true that writers win success through their faults , they win it through them only on condition that they accompany great qualities ... Qualities impose on readers , and failings hold them ; qualities make people admire the writer , and failings make them love him ; qualities inspire veneration , and defects establish and maintain intimacy .

		Now Balzac , perhaps more than any of those whom I have just men - tioned , had just the genius necessary to impose itself , in good earnest , on connoisseurs , rather vaguely upon the general reader ; while he has just enough faults to make himself beloved by the mob : and that is how glory is founded . ''

		The final chapters of the volume , on `` Taste , '' `` Style , '' and `` Balzac after His Death , '' deal more than the others with uni - versals in literary criticism , and are especially attractive for that reason .

		It is unfortunate that the translation as a whole is far from reproducing the sprightliness , elegance , and originality that make the work of M. Faguet so pleasing .

		The volume on Flaubert is bet - ter in this respect .

		If
M. Faguet	PERSON	is inclined to be harsh with
Balzac	LOCATION	and partial to
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, whom he ranks very little below
Balzac	LOCATION	as a creative genius and incomparably higher as an artist and writer , it is because for him the ideal novelist must not mingle with the great quali - ties that inspire veneration the defects that establish and maintain intimacy : '' Flaubert filtered Balzac .

		A romantic to his finger-tips , more so even than
Balzac	LOCATION	, and like him devoured by the demon of observation , his own being more patient , more obstinate , and more minute than
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's , he made up his mind -LRB- be - cause he was the most ' conscious ' and the most deliberate artist in the world -RRB- to satisfy both his passion as a romantic and his passion as a realist , but never to pour both these elements into the same novel .

		It was quite a discovery at the time that he wrote , for it meant the remembering of a law of literary art which had been for long for - gotten or ill understood .

		It meant remembering that the reader , unconsciously , though as impe - riously as possible , at all times requires of a work , I do not say unity of tone , for that means monotony , but unity as regards the general impres - sion , and that the mixing up of romantic art for instance with realistic art bewilders him , discon - certs him , and shocks him just as much as would an anachronism or the mixing up of different epochs . ''

		Flaubert was thus alternately romanticist and realist , and his novels followed , as re - gards the time of their composition , the law of action and reaction , the only `` law '' of literary history in which M. Faguet has any faith : '' This law is sufficiently verified by the history of French literature .

		A period of romantic litera - ture has always been followed by a period of real - istic literature ; a time when we demanded of Art a lively picture of the truth has always come after a period when we enjoyed the magic of the imagination . ''

		But whether indulging his romantic or his realistic bent ,
Flaubert	PERSON	was always consistent , and always supremely the artist .

		His por - trait-painting was superior to
Balzac	LOCATION	's , his landscapes of an absolute reality , his alle - giance was always to the truth , his language was calculated to the utmost degree ; he could not bring himself to tolerate in a sentence `` any break in the rhythm , any dull sounds or any beating of the words against each other ' ' ; he was the master of the artistic style .

		Flaubert 's defects , however , are not al - lowed to escape our attention , though their critic is less outraged by them than by those of Balzac .

		Flaubert was not a great thinker , and not a critic .

		He disliked authors and men whose chief merit lay in ideas , and the one literary principle that found permanent lodgment in his mind was '' that literature ought to be ' impersonal , ' that is to say , that an author should never appear in his work ; never confide his feelings , his ideas , his convictions ; never speak as man to man ; never , even indirectly , allow his ideas or the state of his mind to be understood or suspected through his writing . ''

		He was a misanthrope though he thought men fools rather than rascals .

		He was exas - perated by human stupidity .

		His characters do not make for themselves the place in the memory that
Balzac	LOCATION	's hold .

		This is because he is a true realist , however , and sees only the truth , which is average humanity .

		He does not know the great scoundrels and perverse monsters of
Balzac	LOCATION	.

		His tone is almost al - ways satirical , though he is kept by the sense of truth and the taste for truth from the satire that is mean : `` That suffices to make us grateful to him not only as a great painter and a great writer , but also as one of those morose and bitter moralists , just nev - ertheless , who are something like the harsh con - science of humanity . ''

		M. Faguet 's most serious criticism of Flau - bert is found at the end of the chapter on `` La Tentation de Saint - Antoine '' : `` And above all , it bears witness to a prodigious effort of which the traces have not yet been wiped away and which gives us a sensation of deadly fatigue .

		Flaubert almost always produces that effect .

		Never has he known gay , abundant , happy creation , playing with its easy flow and smiling at it . ''

		He is thinking here not only of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's greatest weakness , but of
Balzac	LOCATION	's greatest 504 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	strength .

		This is a familiar situation : con - fronted on the one hand with genius that bursts all barriers and overwhelms the formal rules of art , and on the other with artistic perfection of form which covers a more or less uninspired content , the critic feels him - self claimed by rival allegiances .

		Shall it be nature or art ?

		If he could only have both at the same time !

		It is little consolation to know that the trouble is as old as
Horace	PERSON	, and as old as art : '' Natura fieret laudabile carmen an arte , Quaesitum est. .

		Ego nee studium sine divite vena , Nee rude quid possit video ingenium : alterius sic
Altera	ORGANIZATION	poscit opem res et coniurat amice . ''

		M. Faguet does not say whether he makes a choice , but it is clear enough that he is very much repelled by the faults of
Balzac	LOCATION	, and very much attracted by the virtues of Flau - bert .

		Here of course comes to mind what we have so often been told about French Ipve of logic and of form , French obedience to estab - lished rules of art , and French horror of irregularity .

		England 's greatest poet is to the Frenchman ' ' an irregular genius , now and then tasteful and touching , but generally in - correct . ''

		`` On the continent , '' again says
Coleridge	PERSON	, `` the works of Shakespeare are honored in a double way by the admiration of the Germans , and by the contempt of the French . ''

		Is Balzac to meet with the same fortune or will German admiration for both
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	and Shakespeare be melted down along with British and French medals ?

		The `` Velsa '' was a yacht , `` smart '' but `` not conventional , '' to quote her proud owner , author of the good ship 's log .

		For she resembled a very pictur - esque Dutch fishing-smack ; she carried a piano , an encyclopaedia , and wonderful beds , but had no promenade deck ; she could slide over shallows , live in any sea , but manifested a `` fierce gaiety '' before the wind that might have disconcerted a less intrepid owner .

		`` With a Dutch skipper , who had never lived regularly in a house and whose one desire in life was to go somewhere else , the `` Velsa '' started on her happy-go-lucky cruise .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has travelled before , and writ - ten the log of the journeys for the profit and amusement of less gifted observers .

		He has sketched vivid glimpses of
Paris	LOCATION	nights .

		He has crossed to
America	LOCATION	and recorded infalli - bly entertaining and often highly illumi - nating impressions of life on our
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	frontiers .

		His pastels of
London	LOCATION	pulse with the grim splendor of the world 's greatest capital .

		`` From the Log of the Velsa '' is as jaunty as `` Your United States '' and less self-conscious ; and , if the strongly dramatic quality of the
Paris	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	sketches is generally lacking , there is instead a delight - ful rambling informality , a rich variety of experience , and a fine zest for those `` pleas - ant average sights '' that , for most of the world , exemplify the adventure of living .

		It was a `` pleasant average '' person who , awed by the artistry of `` The Old Wives ' Tale , '' exclaimed : `` That man could make a sneeze interesting ! ' '

		It is the plain people experimenting in the essentially romantic adventure of every - day living in all the dull little Dutch and Danish ports , ports stagnant , tedious , pro- vincial , but wistful with the desire for such distraction as the '' Velsa V visits pro- vided , the plain people and the `` pleasant average sights '' that Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	went jour - neying to see . ''

		We passed through
Rotterdam	LOCATION	more than once , without seeing more of it than the amazing traffic of its river and its admirable zoological gardens full of chromatically inclined parrots ; but we stopped at a minor town close by , on a canal off the
Meuse	LOCATION	,
Schiedam	LOCATION	.

		Instinct must have guided me , for the sociological interest of
Schiedam	LOCATION	was not inconsiderable . ''

		The visit to
Schiedam	LOCATION	, called by the down-right Dutch `` stinking
Schiedam	LOCATION	, '' took place on a
Wednesday	DATE
evening	TIME	, the night of the weekly municipal concert .

		The tram which conveyed the traveller to the centre of activity , '' rumbled and trundled in long curves of subur - ban desolation .

		Then a few miserable shops that ought to have been shut ; then the square , now jammed in every part with a roaring , barbaric horde .

		In the distance , over a floor of heads , was an island of illumination , with the figures of puffing and blowing musicians in it ; but no rumor of music could reach us through the din .

		The white tram-horse trotted mildly into and right through the multitude , which jeered angrily , but fell back .

		Nevertheless , here , as in other towns , we were struck by the number of shop-windows with artist 's materials for sale .

		Such was
Schiedam	LOCATION	.

		If it is asked whether I went to
Holland	LOCATION	on a yachting cruise to see this sort of thing , the answer is that I just did . ''

		Sometimes it rained inopportunely , and sometimes the motor broke down .

		This hap - pened once in
Friesland	ORGANIZATION	, where `` the road is water , and all the world is on the road '' ; and the `` Velsa 's '' owner , cook , and deck-hand got out to tow , unhappily being obliged to leave the skipper , who alone knew how to tow , on board . ''

		The cook , neurasthenic by temperament , grew sad , until he fell into three feet of inundation , which adventure struck him as profoundly humor - ous , so that he was contorted with laughter .

		This did not advance the yacht .

		Slowly we learned that towing is not mere brute striving , but an art . ''

		At
Hoorn	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	records that he '' went mad and did eight sketches in one day . ''

		It should be noted that , while Mr.
Rickards	PERSON	is official illustrator of the `` Velsa 's '' prog - ress , contributing many charming sketches of the `` pleasant average sights '' and amusing human phenomena observed by Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, the latter gentleman , had he so chosen , might have been his own artist .

		For he belongs to that amazing group of all-around geniuses , along with Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, poet-novelist - cartoonist , and Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, musieian-pam - phleteer-dramatist , who practise all the arts , though they excel in one direction .

		Besides furnishing Mr.
Rickards	PERSON	with congenial com - panionship while he worked , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	actually contributes a frontispiece painting of Aarhus for the `` Velsa 's '' log-book .

		The impetus to the mad sketching bout at Hoorn was furnished by the cheese industry .

		`` At Hoorn I saw three men in blue blouses throwing down spherical cheeses in pairs from the second story of a brown and yellow and green ware-house into a yellow cart .

		One man was in the second story , one in the first , and one in the cart .

		They were flinging cheeses from hand to hand when we arrived and when we left , and they never dropped a cheese or ceased to fling .

		They flung into the mysterious night , when the great forms of little cargo-steamers floated soundless over romance to moor at the dark quays , and the long , white English steam-yacht ... with its myriad lights and gleams , glided to a berth by the water-tower , and hung there like a cloud beyond the town , keeping me awake half the night while I proved to myself that I did not really envy its owner . ''

		In spite of his fondness for dull little towns , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	also loves great cities not for their museums or historic monuments but for their quality of pulsing , noisy , throng - ing life .

		And because ' ' the din , the elbowing , the glitter ' ' of city-life is at its best in the cafes and restaurants , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is a connois - seur of cafes .

		He finds those of
Amsterdam	LOCATION	`` prodigious '' and satisfying .

		Copenhagen from the harbor he describes as `` a bou - quet of copper domes , '' and he admires it as `` a proud city ... where exposed copper turns to a beautiful green instead of to black , as in
London	LOCATION	, '' and as a city of beautiful women .

		At
Boulogne	LOCATION	, where the `` Velsa '' was imprisoned by a gale , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	bought eels , ate them `` with ecstasy , '' and made friends with the herring fishers .

		He dined in
Bruges	LOCATION	, after an absence of twenty years , and after dinner , `` almost saturated with the ex - quisite melancholy of the
Grande Place	ORGANIZATION	, we were too enchanted to move . ' '

		As the log of the `` Velsa '' was written down some time before
Europe	LOCATION	went to war , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	can of course have had no inten - tion of producing a peace document .

		But as one reads of these leisurely , happy cruises through seas now grimly guarded and tragic with war-horrors , to ports now scarred with ramparts or stained with blood and ruin , one is filled with indignation and regret .

		No cruise for the `` Velsa '' this
autumn	DATE	; no such perfect holiday-making as her ship 's com - pany have hitherto enjoyed , for years to come .

		The pity of it is but a minor note in the great chorus of war-misery ; but to some of us , who have found our ideal holidays across the sea , the spoiling of the `` pleasant average sights '' there brings poignant sadness .

		His artist-companion has ably seconded his endeavors to produce an attrac - 506 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	tive book , though the drawings content themselves with being suggestive sketches , and are not fin - ished works of art a fact that has doubtless helped to make possible their lavish abundance .

		The season 's '' wanderer '' book from the pen of Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	bears the title `` A Wanderer in
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is neither a guide nor an historical study ; like the earlier volumes , on
Florence	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	, its aim is to kindle enthusiasm , to create a taste .

		His mood is varied , but always he suggests that
Venice	LOCATION	above all cities must be enjoyed leisurely .

		Now he takes the reader conscientiously to the
Accademia	LOCATION	, pre - pared for a careful study of its Titians , Tintorettos , Leonardos , or Bellinis ; again he steals away to
S. Stefano	PERSON	, highly esteemed by him among the city 's churches because it is pleasant and comfortable and offers '' a harbour of refuge from pictures , '' since it contains none that need be too diligently scruti - nized .

		He writes of a
Venice	LOCATION	that is passing , a
Venice	LOCATION	of motor-boats instead of gondoliers , of cinema theatres crowded in among its ancient ruins , or of gramophones that have replaced the Venetian minstrel ; with equal faithfulness and good-humor he deals with the
Venice Byron	ORGANIZATION	loved , or
Browning	PERSON	, or
Buskin	LOCATION	, or
Shelley	PERSON	.

		In whimsical fashion he exclaims at the end of his account : '' Where many books could not exhaust the theme , what chance has only one ?

		...
Venice	LOCATION	needs a whole library to describe her : a book on her churches and a book on her sculptors ; a book on her old families and a book on her new ; a book on her builders and a book on her bridges ; a book on but why go on ? ''

		Something of all this he does offer , however , in friendly , sociable , holiday mood .

		The illustrations in color are by Mr.
Harry Morley	PERSON	; they furnish delightful glimpses of the city .

		Those in monotone are the more conventional reproductions of famous masterpieces that many guide-books on art contain .

		Tired of the sight of strap-hanging money - chasers , bargain-hunting shoppers , dissipated pleasure-seekers , and all the throng of other famil - iar types composing a great city 's population , and feeling themselves at early middle age as jaded as if they had been on the verge of senility , Mr.
Charles Tenney Jackson	PERSON	and a companion whom he calls '' Hen '' set out in quest of the fountain of youth , not in
Florida	LOCATION	, but in the same latitude in the swamps and lagoons of
Barataria Bay	LOCATION	, about fifty miles south of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		The ad - ventures of these two men in a boat -LRB- which was a swamp pirogue , a kind of craft never before pressed into the service of so long a cruise -RRB- are related in lively , idiomatic style by Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	, with many illustrations from photographs , in a book called `` The Fountain of Youth '' -LRB-
Outing Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which will appeal to the large and increasing number of those who find their keenest delight in the wide outdoors of unspoiled nature .

		And the natives of
Barataria	LOCATION	, as pre - sented by the author , are as little corrupted by civilization as heart could desire .

		If there is anyone who knows his
Boston	LOCATION	better than Mr.
Edwin M. Bacon	PERSON	, author of various handy and useful books about that historic town , the fact has not been made apparent through the printing-press .

		To his previous kindred works Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	now adds `` Rambles around Old
Boston	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a leisurely , gos - sipy , anecdotal sort of book , carrying the reader back to the Old Colony days , and then into the provincial period and so on to the
Boston	LOCATION	of revolutionary times and of final severance from the mother country of which the city of crooked streets is more reminiscent than is any other in the country .

		Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	does well to distinguish , in his retrospect , between the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	period and the Province period a distinction often neglected by our historians and antiquaries .

		In his pages are interesting accounts of the old landmarks ,
Faneuil Hall	PERSON	, the historic Common -LRB- where open pasturage continued until 1830 -RRB- , the Old North Church and the Old South Church ,
King 's Chapel	ORGANIZATION	,
Copp	PERSON	's Hill Burying Ground ,
India Wharf	LOCATION	, and other relics of the past , many of them no longer in existence .

		Good drawings are furnished by Mr.
Lester G. Hornby	PERSON	, who shows himself to be in sympathy with his theme .

		All that this notable and handsome book needs to make it wholly satis - fying is an index .

		But perhaps this lack will encourage a more diligent and consecutive reading of the volume . ''

		Highways and Byways in
Lincolnshire	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is more faithful to the first part of its title than many another of the numerous '' highways and byways '' books , for its author , Mr.
Willingham Franklin Rawnsley	PERSON	, has travelled by motor-car the highways that he describes , and he confines himself closely enough to the broader and the narrower avenues which his book-title sug - gests .

		Lincolnshire is a large county , for
England	LOCATION	, and the description runs to corresponding length -LRB- more than five hundred pages -RRB- , with many excel - lent drawings by Mr.
Frederick L. Griggs	PERSON	.

		Old
Boston	LOCATION	, with its famous church and church-tower , the ``
Boston	LOCATION	stump , '' figures rather prominently and very interestingly in the book .

		It is this church that has been chosen to furnish a frontis - piece for the volume .

		History and tradition and anecdote combine with topographical description to make a variously attractive book .

		A folding map of the county , showing the main roads in red , and apparently all the towns , with the network of railways , follows the index , which is also a thor - ough piece of work .

		Parody , poetry , pungency , persiflage , and sun - dry other constituent elements , not all beginning with p , go to the making of a humorously enter - taining book in Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	's '' Round the World in Any Number of Days '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Starting from
Tilbury	ORGANIZATION	in
June	DATE	, he chased the dawn , in leisurely stages , by way of
Gibraltar	LOCATION	, the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	,
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and
New York	LOCATION	, where the chronicle ends under date of Octo - ber .

		Of chief interest to most American readers are the observations on
America	LOCATION	.

		`` A street boy , a child , in
New York	LOCATION	, '' says Mr.
Baring	PERSON	in generous acknowledgment of our alertness , '' is more nimble - minded , more agile in thought and expression , than the quickest-witted Englishman .

		He will have got there and be walking round him in thought before the Englishman has begun to ex - press himself . ''

		He pays tribute to our baggage - checking system , and otherwise shows himself to
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 507 be not hopelessly prejudiced in favor of the
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean way of doing things .

		Amusing drawings by two clever illustrators help to leave one in no doubt that the book is not a volume of sermons .

		A country has as many aspects as there are pairs of eyes to view it .

		An American girl 's way of looking at things Japanese , Chinese , and
Philip	PERSON	- pine , is agreeably presented in Miss
M. Leola Crawford	PERSON	's '' Seven Weeks in the Orient , '' a com - panion volume to her earlier '' Seven Weeks in
Hawaii	LOCATION	. ''


Yokohama	LOCATION	,
Tokyo	LOCATION	,
Kyoto	LOCATION	,
Canton	LOCATION	,
Hong Kong	LOCATION	, and
Manila	LOCATION	, with occasional less im - portant and less-known places , were visited by
Miss Crawford	PERSON	and her companion , and the ac - count of things seen shows the writer to be alive to all that ought to interest a touring American woman , and the mistress of a literary style ade - quate to the needs of the occasion .

		Rich and varied is her equipment of adjectives no super - fluous furniture in the gorgeous Orient but she rather exceeds the demands of the situation when she writes of '' the most extreme southern part of Kyoto . ''

		Sixty-eight pictures from photographs enliven the narrative , but one wishes that a de - scriptive word or two had been printed beneath each illustration .

		The book is published by Mr.
Howard D. Berrett	PERSON	, 518
Wrightwood Avenue	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Even into Mr.
W. Barnes Steveni	PERSON	's peaceful pic - ture of '' Things Seen in
Sweden	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- there has crept a suggestion of militarism in the author 's reference to
Sweden	LOCATION	's preparedness for the possi - ble invader . ''

		Shooting competitions are organ - ized on such a scale that this little nation , with a population less than that of
London	LOCATION	, will soon be ready to take up the challenge of a much larger Power , if necessary . ''

		The book , a compact duo - decimo , is almost as rich in half-tone illustrations of much beauty and interest as it is in reading mat - ter .

		Mr.
Steveni	PERSON	emphasizes the charms of
Sweden	LOCATION	, too often overlooked by tourists in favor of the more familiar attractions of
Norway	LOCATION	or
Switzer	PERSON	- land ,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	, or
France	LOCATION	.

		In calling attention to the great stretch of diversified territory included in the kingdom , he gives the total length of the country as twelve hundred miles , which looks like an exaggeration by about two hundred miles , unless the geographies are at fault .

		Geog - raphy , ethnology , climatology , with other matters having less learned names , have gone into the making of a good and useful book in this pocket handbook of
Sweden	LOCATION	.

		Many fine examples of half-tone illustration , with a smaller number of colored plates from paint - ings by Mr.
Chris Jb	PERSON	` rgensen , have gone to the making of Mr.
John H. Williams	PERSON	's imposing vol - ume , '' Yosemite and Its High Sierra . ''

		Expert amateur photographers in the
Sierra Club	ORGANIZATION	, with some professional camera artists , have contributed these unusually striking views of mountain scenery .

		It is true that the
Yosemite Valley	LOCATION	has been repro - duced in illustration to the point of weariness , but the
High Sierra	ORGANIZATION	back of it is a less hackneyed theme .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's descriptive text necessarily takes a subordinate place in so splendidly illus - trated a work .

		A blue tint is used in the pictures from photographs , while Mr.
Jb	PERSON	` rgensen 's work seems to have been skilfully reproduced by the color-printer .

		The book is published by Mr.
Williams	PERSON	at
Tacoma	LOCATION	and
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Those to whom cathedrals , churches , abbeys , and monasteries are the most interesting features of the European landscape will thoroughly enjoy Mr.
Michael Barrett	PERSON	's `` Rambles in Catholic Lands '' -LRB-
Benziger Bros.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a record of travel through southern
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, the
Tyrol	LOCATION	, and northern
Italy	LOCATION	, with especial attention to the sacred edifices representing the religious faith of the chronicler .

		Many places not included in the ordinary tourist 's itinerary become objects of in - terest in Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	's pages .

		Einsiedeln , with its famous monastery and college ,
Fiecht	LOCATION	, with its abbey ,
Volders	ORGANIZATION	, with its religious house where the monks of Beuron found temporary refuge on being expelled from
Prussia	LOCATION	, are among these less fashionable resorts of sight-seers .


Venice	LOCATION	, Fer - rara , and
Florence	LOCATION	are the Italian cities visited by the author .

		Many beautiful tinted views from photographs emphasize the attractions of the route chosen by him , and these illustrations are by no means confined to churches and abbeys .

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS .

		In the main room of what was once the Bishop 's Palace at
Bayeux	LOCATION	in
Normandy	LOCATION	there is to be seen , wrought in tapestry , a pictorial representation of the Norman conquest of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The Book of the
Bayeux	LOCATION	Tapestry '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- contains seventy - six colored panels which collectively reproduce as accurately as may be this famous picture-story of one of the chief episodes in English history .

		Mr.
Hilaire Belloe	PERSON	writes an Introduction and a running commentary to the quaint pageant .

		He assigns to the tapestry a date not later than 1200 r and not earlier than 1140 ,
A.D.	LOCATION	And in his notes , wisely restricted in number , he allows himself a sharp hit at the learned historian of the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	, thus : '' The Tapestry , of course , does not show
Freeman	PERSON	's famous '
Palisade	LOCATION	, ' and that for an excellent reason .

		The
Palisade	LOCATION	never ex - isted outside the imagination of Oxford . ''

		A map of
Normandy	LOCATION	and southeastern
England	LOCATION	opens the book , which is in every respect an unusually fine example of the printer 's , the illustrator 's , and the binder 's combined arts .

		As if in celebration of the eightieth birthday of Major
Henry Lee Higginson	PERSON	, whose zeal and gen - erosity have done so much for
Boston	LOCATION	's most famous musical organization , there comes from the press an historical sketch , by Mr.
M. A. DeWolfe Howe	PERSON	, of '' The Boston Symphony Orchestra '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , from its beginnings under
Georg Henschel	PERSON	in 1881-84 to its present approximation to artistic perfection under Dr.
Karl Muck	PERSON	.

		There is something pathetic in Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's picture of the benefactor 's early disablement as a musician in his own person and his subsequent and , one may add , consequent eagerness to make neverthe - less his mark in the world of music by endowing with the pecuniary product of his commercial activities an orchestra worthy of the city where he makes his home .

		For a book modestly described by its author as '' not the work of a musical critic , but of an editor and annalist , '' the present volume 508 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	shows an admirable grasp of its subject , going into various details that might not have been ex - pected .

		Appended pages give lists of soloists , of the entire personnel of the
Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	, and of its repertoire .

		Illustrations and an index complete the book 's equipment .

		The celebrated chimes of the Low Countries have never been the object of greater interest in no small part an anxious interest than at the present time .

		Mr.
William Gorham Rice	PERSON	offers therefore a seasonable book in his '' Carillons of
Belgium	LOCATION	and Holland : Tower Music in the Low Countries '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , a systematic and apparently accurate account of all the more important chimes whose aerial harmonies typify , to Mr.
Rice	PERSON	at least , the peculiar charm of this part of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		But he would caution us not to confuse the chime , which is attuned to intervals of the diatonic scale , with the carillon , which has a chromatic scale and a consequent greater number of bells than the chime , and richer musical possibilities .

		Somewhat of a pioneer in his researches , the author has delved for information in the libraries of various lands , besides receiving aid from many persons who share his affection and admiration for the Dutch and Flemish peoples .

		Photographic repre - sentations of famous bell-towers and their groups of bells , with a map of the '' carillon region '' and a page of carillon music , enrich the volume , which also has appended matter of statistical , historical , and technical interest .

		Unusually attractive in many ways is this well-planned and well-executed volume .

		Initiation into the mysteries of the oriental rug is offered in reasonably brief form , and with a generous accompaniment of pictured examples of this branch of art , by Dr.
G. Griffin Lewis	PERSON	in a vol - ume of ample page-dimensions , well suited to the purposes of graphic illustration . ''

		The Mystery of the Oriental Rug '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is less elabo - rate and hence much less expensive than the same author 's '' Practical Book of Oriental Rugs , '' but it contains the essentials desired by those knowing little on the subject and wishing to learn more at a small expense of time and money .

		Descriptions of the thirty plates in the book are appended .

		Smaller illustrations are interspersed in the read - ing matter , and a colored frontispiece shows the splendors of a silk prayer-rug from Ispahan .

		`` With the fast-diminishing opportunity to procure genuine antiques in eastern rugs , Dr.
Griffin	PERSON	's book is one to study and profit by now or never .

		Mrs.
Eliza Calvert Hall	PERSON	's notable work of two years ago , `` A Book of Hand-woven Coverlets '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which was commended by us upon its first appearance , is now offered , in all its original excellence of typography and beauti - ful , colored illustrations , at a - greatly reduced price .

		Thus brought within reach of a larger number of purchasers , it should enjov a new lease of life .

		Unlike '' The
Honest House	ORGANIZATION	, '' already noticed by us , '' Country Houses '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- exhibits the work of a single architect , Mr.
Aymar Embury	PERSON	, 2nd , or as he writes it , after the fashion of reign - ing dynasties ,
Aymar Embury	PERSON	II .

		Mr.
Henry H. Say	PERSON	lor selects and edits the plans that are illus - trated on the book 's spacious pages , and he also writes an explanatory ` and appreciative Introduc - tion , which is followed by a shorter preliminary note by Mr.
Embury	PERSON	himself .

		Few architects have given more study than he to a branch of their art that is rather notoriously ill-paid as compared with the designing of business blocks and public build - ings .

		Still young in years , Mr.
Embury	PERSON	has won wide recognition for his skill and taste in domestic architecture .

		The book 's illustrations show exte - rior views -LRB- one or two of each house -RRB- , floor plans , and an occasional interior .

		Brief explanatory notes are given here and there .

		The large , clean - cut half-tones are a delightfto the eye .

		Following partly as a sequel to Dean
Spence	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	's '' Handbook to
Gloucester Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, '' though independent in character , the same au - thor 's book on '' The Secrets of a Great Cathedral '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is intended as an answer to '' the leading questions which are often put to the writer , who is the chief custodian of a great pile , partly Roman - esque , partly Gothic , as to the signification and origin of certain prominent features of an impor - tant Mediaeval Church . ''

		These questions concern the meaning and history of the term Romanesque as applied to architecture ; they also have to do with the
Lady Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, the
Crypt	LOCATION	, the Cloister , and
Saint Petronilla	LOCATION	, with other matters of interest to students of church architecture and church history .

		Illustrations help to make clear the author 's mean - ing , and a full index closes the book .

		The Dean of
Gloucester	LOCATION	shows himself to be an ardent student in his department of research , and his writings are authoritative .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE .


Hans Breitmann	PERSON	is still popular enough to in - sure a welcome for the complete edition of the amusing '' Ballads , '' with an Introduction by the author 's niece and biographer , Mrs.
Joseph Pen	PERSON	- nell .

		Most of us owe our acquaintance with
Breit	PERSON	- mann to some imperfect and perhaps pirated edition of the verses bearing his name ; hence our satisfaction at finding him procurable in full in the tasteful octavo issued -LRB- in a limited edition , one regrets to add -RRB- by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with the title , ``
Hans Breitmann	PERSON	's Ballads . ''


Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	died while his German-American hero was still one of the best-known characters in imaginative literature .

		His niece predicts a re - vival of his popularity , though it may be that not all English-speaking readers are just now in the best mood to enjoy the strong German flavor of these admirable ballads .

		The present edition is of pleasing design , and is provided with slip-case and box .

		By no means new to her readers are the poems collected in Laurence Hope 's ''
India	LOCATION	's Love Lyrics , including The Garden of Kama '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		In fact , the collection has gone through a number of edi - tions , but not till now has it found its predestined illustrator , Mr.
Byam Shaw	PERSON	, himself a native of
India	LOCATION	and thus more likely than another to have breathed in the spirit that animates the poems .

		Twenty-four richly colored plates , with smaller designs interspersed , fittingly illustrate the two hundred -LRB- or somewhat fewer , to be exact -RRB- love
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 509 lyrics from
Laurence Hope	PERSON	's facile pen .

		Amorous passion in its intensity , described with oriental wealth of imagery , is of course the prevailing theme .

		Royal quarto in its dimensions , the vol - ume admits of the most liberal indulgence in wide margins , large type , ample illustration , and unre - stricted decoration , although the printed pages are rather sparingly embellished by the artist .

		Few more striking productions have come from the press this season .

		For the first time
Thoreau	PERSON	's essay on `` Walking , '' which first appeared in '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' for
June , 1862	DATE	, and was soon afterward included in the volume entitled '' Excursions , '' is published in separate form .

		It makes a little book of one hundred pages in the Riverside Press series of lim - ited editions .

		Thoreau believed that the walker is born , not made -LRB- `` Ambulator nascitur , non fit '' -RRB- , and his praise of pedestrianism is one of the class - ics in its kind .

		Never was eloquent essay of the sort more needed than in this present age of motor - car madness .

		Back to nature and the natural method of locomotion , is its lesson .

		-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Already one artist 's not unsuccessful attempt to picture to the eye the more noteworthy scenes of `` A Midsummer Night 's Dream '' has been noted by us among the more elaborately illustrated books of the season .

		A second essay in the same inviting field , on the part of Mr.
W. Heath Robinson	PERSON	, claims equal attention and commendation .

		In a handsome quarto of nearly two hundred pages , his numerous full-page designs , colored and plain , show to excel - lent advantage .

		The colored plates have each a predominant tint , and appeal to the sense of beauty and charm , while the black-and-white illustrations place more emphasis on the comic element of the poet 's work .

		Broad margins , large type , appro - priate cover design , and other details are such as to satisfy the aesthetic sense .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the book .

		A reissue of Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	's already oft-reprinted story of his boyhood , '' The Golden Age '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , is justified by the charm of that admirable narrative , a charm felt by backward - looking maturity rather than by eagerly expectant youth .

		The book is too wise , too sophisticated , too frank in its humorous acknowledgment of child - hood 's delightful illusions , to win the confidence of the young people , tremendously serious as they are in their view of things .

		The illustrator of this sumptuous edition of Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	's masterpiece is Mr.
R. J. E. Moony	PERSON	, whose full-page drawings are resplendent with the hues appropriate to such iridescent memories of the morning of life .

		The light that never was , on sea or land , illumines both the narrative and its pictorial accompaniment .

		Golden ships of antique design sail over the book 's broad cover , and colored borders set off the hand - somely printed text .

		A new printing of the modern prose English version of Chaucer , by Professor
John S. P. Tat	PERSON	- lock and Mr.
Percy MacKaye	PERSON	, with illustrations by Mr.
Warwick Goble	PERSON	, comes from the
Macmil	PERSON	- lan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	in ocular demonstration of the deserved success of this readable paraphrase of a too-much neglected classic .

		Two years have passed since the first publication of this , the only complete , prose rendering in modern English of Chaucer 's poetical works ; and in that time it has evidently won its way into favor with at least some portion of the reading public .

		Christmas without a newly illustrated edition of
Dickens	PERSON	's '' Carol '' would hardly be Christmas at all in the book-world .

		This year the illustrator is Mr.
Arthur I. Keller	PERSON	, and of his dozen full-page pictures eight have the true holiday appearance imparted by unstinted use of cheerful colors .

		Smaller drawings head the five successive '' staves ' r of the ''
Christmas Carol	PERSON	, '' and a bright binding and ornamented box help to attract attention to the book .

David McKay	PERSON	. -RRB-

		HOLIDAY FICTION .

		Appropriate to the season is Miss Sehna Lager -
Ib	ORGANIZATION	` f 's story , `` The Legend of the Sacred Image '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , translated by Miss
Velma Swanston	PERSON	How - ard .

		An aged peasant couple 's faith in the mir - aculous power of a certain crucifix in the cathedral at
Lucca	LOCATION	is the theme of the legend , which ends with the granting of the old people 's wish as devoutly expressed in prayer at the foot of the sacred image .

		The story is simply and pleasingly told in a dainty white volume that comes in a pro- tecting case , the whole being of pocket size .

		Three Christmas stories by Miss
Leona Dalrym	PERSON	- ple make their appearance this season , either as new or reprinted for the occasion . ''

		Uncle
Noah	PERSON	's Christmas Inspiration '' pictures the unselfish devo - tion of an old negro servant to his former master and mistress , impoverished by the war .

		His '' inspiration '' procures the family a Christmas turkey and is the prelude to other even more joy - ous results .

		`` Uncle Noah 's Christmas Party '' introduces once more some of the characters so - agreeably depicted in the earlier book , but it is hardly equal to that first story in interest .

		The party is given in a barn by the resourceful old negro , the year after the events narrated in the '' Inspiration , '' and it is attended by sundry occur - rences of a glad and surprising nature . ''

		In the Heart of the
Christmas Pines	LOCATION	'' is a pretty and touching story of love reciprocated , with other pleasing incidents thrown in for full measure .

		The heroine contrives to make the acquaintance of her future mother-in-law without revealing the pros - pective relationship , and is wholly pleased with what she thus discovers .

		All three books have col - ored pictures and cheerful decorations , and are published by Messrs.
McBride	PERSON	,
Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of Christmas stories there is fortunately no lack this season .

		`` Little Merry Christmas '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Winifred Arnold	PERSON	, tells of the happy trans - formation of Uncle
Lemuel Perkins	PERSON	, alias `` Grouchy Gruff , '' by his fascinating little niece ,
Mary Chris	PERSON	- tie , who also has a nickname , '' Little Merry Christmas . ''

		Four scenes in the story are pictured by the artist .

		In '' How It Happened '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- f by Mrs.
Kate Langley Bosher	PERSON	, one reads how two lovers were parted by a mere difference of opinion , and brought together again for a wedding on Christmas day by a bright , loving , unselfish child ,
Carmencita	PERSON	, worthy successor in our affections to the same author 's
Mary Gary	PERSON	.

		The book is illus - trated .

		`` The Rejuvenation of Father Christ - 510 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	mas '' -LRB-
Pilgrim Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
J. Edgar Park	PERSON	, shows us the salutary change of old
Santa Glaus	ORGANIZATION	into a younger and more useful member of society ; that is , Father Christmas , with his traditional stock of shop-worn gifts , becomes Brother Christmas , preaching the doctrine of `` peace through good - will '' every day in the year until Christmas eve , when he is allowed to resume his ancient role and bestow presents for the mere joy of giving .

		Of course there are pictures to point the moral and adorn the tale .

		The practiced hand of Mrs.
Mary Stewart	PERSON	Cutting turns itself readily to the telling of a Christmas tale in '' The Blossoming Rod '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , the story of a father 's little family worries and troubles upon the approach of the annual gift-giving day , and of his glad surprise in receiving just the gift he most desired , a trout rod .

		That it was his own money , handed out in reluctant driblets to his wife and children , that paid for the rod , gives point to the story .

		A colored frontis - piece and decorations in green embellish the book .

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		No Christmas season is complete without a book on happiness .

		This year Mr.
Robert Haven Schauffler	PERSON	collects a number of his periodical essays in praise of cheerfulness and enthusiasm , and adds two new ones , grouping them all under the title .

		`` The Joyful Heart '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and explaining in his Preface that the volume is '' a guide-book to joy '' and '' a manual of enthusi - asm . ''

		Probably it is about as difficult to teach happiness as to teach English literature , as to which latter the author says , in a chapter ad - dressed to poets : '' One shudders to think of all the fellowship money which is now being used to finance reluctant young dry-as-dusts while they are preparing to pack still tighter the already overcrowded ranks of ` professors of English lit - erature ' whose profession , as Mr.
Gerald Stanley Lee	PERSON	justly remarks , is founded on the striking principle that a very great book can be taught by a very little man . ''

		Still , there are such things as helpful hints to readers of English literature , and some books there are that give useful suggestions to seekers after happiness ; and Mr.
Schauffler	PERSON	's volume is one of these .

		Dr.
Hugh Black	PERSON	's contribution to this season 's books has the qualities that have already made him a favorite with those who look for moral stimulus and a serious consideration of ethical questions in their reading .

		Undeterred by the fact that already two works of fiction bear the title , '' The Open Door , '' he chooses that name for his thoughtful volume , which considers , successively , the open door of our unfolding existence , the laws of the open door -LRB- which are the law of faith and the law of fitness -RRB- , the shut door of the past , the door - ways of tradition , the magic door of youth , the lure of the open door , the door of opportunity , the adventure of the open door , and the last open door , leading from this to a future life .

		Apt illustration and quotation enrich the several chap - ters , but Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	would have looked a little more natural if the printer had not given him a superfluous '' t. '' The book is one to read in as opportunity offers .

		-LRB-
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Confident affirmation rather than convincing demonstration is to be found in Mr.
Howard Sutherland	PERSON	's little book , '' The Promise of Life '' -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a consideration of the question of a future existence . ''

		The fact that we were alive yesterday , '' says the author , '' and that we enjoy to-day , should convince us of what we call Immortality . ''

		And again : '' How can there be an end to life ?

		It is the divine mood made manifest . ''

		Mr.
Sutherland	PERSON	holds that '' the con - sciousness of eternal life as natural law must be inborn , and ... some are surer of it than others . ''

		Admitting thus the futility of attempting any proof , he nevertheless speaks with a firmness of faith that will produce its effect on his readers .

		The book is beautifully printed and neatly bound .

		The country house of Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton Castle	PERSON	, '' high on the southern moorlands of Sur - rey , '' is the theme of a pleasing volume from their pens entitled '' Our Sentimental Garden '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		Chat about their pet animals , their flowers and fruits and trees , the memories and imaginings that come to them in their '' little para - dise on the hill , '' and all sorts of whims and fan - cies , go to fill the two-score chapters of this sunny volume , which , begun light-heartedly in days of peace , is now sent forth in the hope that , '' as a sprig of Lavender , or a Cowslip , by his pillow might for a moment relieve the blood-tinted vision of a stricken soldier , so , perhaps , some unquiet heart labouring under the strain of long-drawn suspense , will find a passing relaxation , a forgot - ten smile , '' in the scenes and characters of '' Our Sentimental Garden . ''

		Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	sup - plies eight appropriate and beautiful colored pic - tures and innumerable dainty drawings in the text .

		What the philosophers and the poets have told us over and over again , and what one poet in par - ticular has well said in the words , '' Self - rever - ence , self-knowledge , self-control , these three alone lead life to sovereign power , '' is the sum and substance of Mr.
Vance Thompson	PERSON	's whimsical but pleasing little volume , '' The Ego Book '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , which he further calls '' a book of selfish ideals . ''

		But if we hold with Polonius that to be true to others one must first be true to oneself , the seem - ingly selfish ideal may be only the unselfish ideal viewed from another side .

		Be on good terms with your own ego , the author repeatedly urges us , and rest assured that the world is his who masters him - self .

		This lesson Mr.
Thompson	PERSON	contrives to teach through clever illustration and fanciful imagery .

		Calm cogency , sweet reasonableness , propitiatory gentleness , anger-dispelling humor , and playful nimbleness of wit are the agreeable character - istics of Dr.
Samuel McChord Crothers	PERSON	's ''
Medita	PERSON	- tions on Votes for Women '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		One great advantage of meditation over disputation is that '' we are not required to reach any predeter - mined conclusions .

		We have no nervous anxiety to catch any particular train of thought , as we are travelling on our own feet , and are willing to put up wherever the night finds us . ''

		He who meditates is permitted to dwell , if he chooses , on the things that '' go without saying , '' and he thus assures him - self , if not others , that they are still going .

		Mr.
Crothers	PERSON	finds that '' equal suffrage is not the first
1914	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 511 step in an impending revolution , but only a neces - sary adjustment to the results of a revolution that has already happened , '' and that '' the driving power of the movement for equal suffrage is not Feminism but democracy . ''

		Entertaining and not unconvincing is the author 's argument , from the
Bible	LOCATION	and other authoritative sources , that the `` new '' woman is as old as the human race .

		He does not profess to remove '' the weighty practical diffi - culties in the way of woman suffrage , '' but he helps to allay the anxieties of those whose pet nightmare takes the form of '' Votes for Women . ''

		Rose-lovers will enjoy the sumptuous plates in color and half-tone found in '' The Practical Book of Outdoor Rose Growing for the Home Garden '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , prepared by Mr.
George C. Thomas	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Rose-growers will find equal satisfaction in the accompanying text , which furnishes adequate sug - gestions to the amateur regarding the ordering of roses , their planting and cultivation , together with general advice on hybridization .

		The author is himself well-known as a successful amateur rose - grower .

		His field of experimentation has been re - stricted to
America	LOCATION	, and the information presented in this volume has as its base the approximate climate of the
Middle Atlantic States	LOCATION	, with ap - pended directions for rose-growing farther north and farther south .

		Those who regret the lack of detail with which Gospel incidents are related will greet with ap - proval Mr.
C. R. Blackall	PERSON	's elaboration of the story of blind Bartimeus . ''

		The Son of Timeus '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- mainly follows the account given in
St. Mark	LOCATION	, and evident care has been taken to make the historical setting and other details as correct as possible .

		As thus elaborated , the story 's chief characters , besides
Bartimeus	PERSON	, are his mother ,
Hamama	PERSON	, his brother
Nathan	PERSON	, his sister
Rachel	PERSON	, a kinsman , a rabbi , and a few others .

		Jericho ,
Emmaus	LOCATION	, and
Jerusalem	LOCATION	are the scenes of the various incidents .

		Excellent drawings accompany the narrative , and the whole is printed in brown , with decorated cover to match .

		The poet laureate of
North Dakota	LOCATION	, Mr.
James W. Foley	PERSON	, offers another welcome collection of his hilarious and hearty verses in rural dialect , under the title , `` Tales of the Trail '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		In this '' book of western verse , '' as its sub-title styles it , the author strengthens his claim to be ranked with those older poets of the West ,
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	.

		His lines have the unmistakable ring of large-hearted geniality and abounding humor .

		Nearly four-score pieces are given , with admirably illustrative drawings , and this is how the last poem , '' The Forum , '' ends : '' Down to
Hicks	PERSON	's grocery store , I allow we 've settled more Burnin ' questions in a night Than the courts an ' done it right .

		Hicks , he allus keeps in touch With the world 's crowned heads an ' such , An ' there 's very little goes On abroad but what he knows .

		But he says to
Treadwell Pew	ORGANIZATION	' Who 'll I charge them herrings to ? ' ''

		Dog-lovers , of whom luckily there is no lack , will hail approvingly the handsome edition now issued of Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's story of his canine pet ,
Chris	PERSON	.

		First published in '' The Inn of Tranquillity , '' this intimate history of a dog has not hitherto been procurable in separate form . ''

		Memories '' is the rather inadequate title it bears , but its other and more positive qualities atone for the want of character in the title .

		Miss
Maud Earl	PERSON	contributes nearly thirty colored and uncol - ored pictures of our four-footed hero in various aspects .

		Chris shows himself deserving of an affection little if any less warm than that accorded to Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	's
Rab	PERSON	, to Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	's Stickeen , and to other immortal representatives of doggish virtues .

		The book is a thin quarto of handsome design , its full-page plates being espe - cially striking .

		-LRB- Scribner . -RRB- ''

		Reader , comfortable armchair reader , bilious morning-train reader , have you ever posed ? ''

		asks Mr.
W. R. Titterton	PERSON	in the early pages of his book , '' Me as a Model '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- .

		It is a book of Bohemian reminiscences , of art-student life in
Paris	LOCATION	, of things that are '' neither fact nor fiction , '' the author tells us , but '' the golden mean between them which the conscientious writer must ever seek to find . ''

		He declares it is not autobiography , and yet hints that it may be something not altogether unlike autobiography , and so mystifies and tanta - lizes us to his heart 's content .

		Let us call the book a dish of scrambled eggs and not try to unscramble them .

		Verse as well as prose goes to its making , and a sufficiency of French , largely interjectional and expletive , is sprinkled in italics through the pages .

		Mr.
Edmund Blampied	PERSON	does his part to our satisfaction in three colored drawings and thirty - seven uncolored ones , the latter being rather better than the former .

		He who opens the book in quest of light entertainment will not be disappointed .

		Mr.
Lawrence B. Saint	PERSON	has had the courage to undertake what might be called a second '' Pil - grim 's Progress '' in his parable of spiritual adventure and spiritual conquest entitled `` A Knight of the Cross '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , wherein the hero , none other than Christian , makes his way , amid various significant happenings , from the
Lodge of Spiritual Service	ORGANIZATION	to
Emanuel	ORGANIZATION	's Land and the
King 's City	ORGANIZATION	.

		This undisguised imitation of Bun - yan , even to the quaintly descriptive proper names , inevitably invites comparison with the mas - terpiece endeared to so many readers from child - hood ; and one may question the discretion while admiring the courage of the accomplished author .

		But let each read and judge for himself .

		Mr.
Saint	PERSON	's talents include a gift for illustrating , and his colored plates and decorative designs give the book an inviting appearance .

		This is the fitting season in which to read and heed the lesson of Miss
Margaret Slattery	PERSON	's little book , `` He Took It upon Himself '' -LRB-
Pilgrim Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The examples of
Horace Mann	PERSON	, Dr.
Barnardo	PERSON	,
Jacob Riis	PERSON	, Judge
Lindsey	PERSON	, Mr.
Ernest Coulter	PERSON	,
Miss Helen Keller	PERSON	, and others , besides the great example commemorated annually at this time , are briefly but feelingly touched upon in advocacy of the unselfish life of usefulness to the distressed and downtrodden .

		In its pleasing form , with deli - cate ornamentation and appropriate illustration , the book is well suited to gift purposes .

		512 THE DIAL -LSB-

		An authority on naval strategy , and perhaps the most widely read writer on the subject of sea power that the world has ever known , Admiral
Mahan	PERSON	, died on the first of this month at the naval hospital in
Washington	LOCATION	.


Alfred Thayer Mahan	PERSON	, born at
West Point	LOCATION	,
September 27 , 1840	DATE	, son of a professor in the
U. S. Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	, chose the navy rather than the army in selecting his future calling , and was graduated from the Naval Acad - emy at
Annapolis	LOCATION	in
1859	DATE	.

		He served in various capacities and with increasing honor in the Civil War , and afterward rendered useful service at sev - eral of our navy yards and as president of the
Naval War College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rising to the rank of captain in
1885	DATE	, he retired in

		He acted as dele - gate to the

American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	in
1902-03	DATE	, and enjoyed the distinction of membership in both the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters and the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book that first made him famous and procured him worldwide recognition as an authority in his department of study was '' The Influence of Sea Power upon History , '' which appeared in
1890	DATE	, and was followed by kindred works of little less note .

		These writings gained for him the half-dozen or more academic degrees conferred by
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, Cam - bridge ,
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
McGill	ORGANIZATION	, and
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		He wrote biographies of Farragut and
Nelson	PERSON	, chap - ters of autobiography and reminiscence , and at least one serious work wholly removed from the interests and activities with which his name is commonly associated .
