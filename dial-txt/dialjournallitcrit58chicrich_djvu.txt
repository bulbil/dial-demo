THE LIFE OF 

THOMAS B. REED 

By 
Samuel W. McCall 

From a three-column review in the Boston Transcript 

" The best thing to say about McCalFs ' Life of Thomas B. Reed ' is that everyone 
should read it. It is quite impossible to dissect and analyze the work. As a whole, it 
gives a complete picture of the man and compels the reader to feel a sense of personal 
acquaintance and friendship with him. Very likely a biography of Thomas B. Reed 
more detailed and exhaustive will at some time be written and very likely his speeches 
will be put before the public with some measure of completeness, but it is not too much 
to say that ' Tom ' Reed will be known by McCall's book rather than by any other work, 
however complete. Mr. McCall had many advantages for the undertaking of this work 
and his selection to prepare it for the Statesmen's Series was not only a happy but 
almost an inevitable one. He knew Mr. Reed well and intimately very likely called 
him ' Tom ' certainly he himself was called ' Samuel,' for Mr. Reed eschewed the 
abbreviated form by which his biographer is best known. He served in Congress with 
him for eight years, delivered the oration at the unveiling of his statue at Portland, and, 
being selected by the family for the writing of the book, has had free access to the 
family papers. The great temptation for a man of Mr. McCall's scholarship and knowl- 
edge of the history for the last four decades must have been to overweight the book 
with the story of public affairs and to lose sight of the work as a biography. This 
temptation has been resisted. The running story of parties and politics and measures 
during Mr. Reed's public life is admirably but succinctly told, but the main purpose of 
the book is everywhere in evidence and current affairs are used only as a setting of the 
picture. Moreover, the author has allowed the subject to tell his own story and to create 
his own impression. It would have been an easy matter to cull from letters and 
speeches of Mr. Reed and from the numberless anecdotes told about him or attributed 
to him a book of quadruple the size of the present volume, and it would have been of 
distinct interest. The value of this work, however, is in the admirable selections which 
have been made and the way in which they illustrate the life story which is being told. 
Nothing is dragged in merely because it is eloquent or witty, but everything is placed 
in its true position and perspective in the narrative. . . . The intimacy between Mr. 
Reed and Mr. Long during the long years of their acquaintance is deliciously brought 
out, and the picture of the table at The Hamilton, at which they both sat, is one to stir 
the imagination of every lover of fun. ... It would be possible to extend this 
review almost indefinitely, but it cannot be done without injustice to the work itself. 
It should close as it began, with advice to read the work itself. To those whose knowl- 
edge of public affairs embraces the eighties and nineties, the book will be of delightfully 
reminiscent value. In reading it they will live over two decades in the crucial life of the 
nation. To those who come later, there is history which should not be forgotten and the 
life-size portrait of a great and many-sided actor in it."

THE WORKS OF RABINDRANATH TAGORE 



"Rabindranath Tagore, the mystic poet of India, who in 1913 was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, more than 
any of the preachers, teachers or writers of Europe or America, has given expression to deep philosophical and religious 
insight, which is quickened with intellectual honesty and scientific clearness. Son of Abanindranath Tagore, a teacher 
and artist, and brother of Dwijendranath Tagore, a philosopher, he belongs to a family which for generations has pro- 
duced great men. In his youth he was surrounded by the influences of literature^ and music, and in his maturity he has 
written prose and verse of amazing strength and lyrical beauty. He does not in his poetry set the themes of life to great 
music; he speaks them in a soft voice to the heart with all the simplicity and directness of power. He takes the little in- 
timate things which comprise life, and fashions them into pearls which reflect the color of the sky, the mightiness of love 
and life. He has vision; he has intelligence in love, the last test of a man '* nature. ' ' The Observer. 

Rabindranath Tagore 's Two New Books 



"One of the most important of Tagore' s Works." 

THE SONGS OF KABIR 

Translated from the Original Bengaliby RabindranathTagore. 

In this volume, Rabindranath Tagore renders in his 
peerless English, and with deeply sympathic interpretation, 
a selection of the songs of Kabir, the Hindu religious reformer 
and conciliator whose teachings exercised an important 
influence in upper India in the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries. This book is one of the most important of 
Tagore's works. Ready shortly. $1.25 



"The most perfect expression of Tagore's geniits." 

THE KING OF THE DARK 
CHAMBER 

Translated by the author from the Original Bengali. 

"The most careless reader can hardly proceed far into 
these inspired pages without realizing that he is in the 
presence of holy things of an allegory of the soul such as 
has not before been told in the English tongue. . . . Happy 
will be those readers whom the King of these pages does 
not elude." Chicago Evening Post. $1.25 



Rabindranath Tagore's Other Works 

" My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said . . . Here art Thou! . . . Life of my life, I shall ever try to 
keep all untruths out from my thoughts, knowing that thou art that truth which has kindled the light of reason in my mind. 
I shall ever try to drive all evils away from my heart and keep my love in flower, knowing that thou hast thy seat in the 
inmost shrine of my heart. " Gitanjali. 



"A book of supreme beauty; rare and wondrous." The Express. 



GITANJALI 



(Song Offerings) 

Translated by the author from the Original Bengali with 
an Introduction by W. B. Yeats and a portrait by W. Rothen- 
stein. 

"Of trance-like beauty. . . . The expanding senti- 
ment of some of the poems wins, even through the alien 
medium of our English prose, a rhythm which in its strength 
and melody might recall familiar passages in the Psalms or 
Solomon's Song." The Athenaeum. $1.25 



'One of the great messages of modern times." Pall Mall Gazette. 



SADHANA 



The Realization of Life. 



Essays.

beauty of the language in which Tagore's philosophy is 
enshrined defies analysis. " Pall Mall Gazette. $1.25 



"An unparalleled vision of childhood." The Nation. 

THE CRESCENT MOON 

Child Poems. 

Translated by the author from the Original Bengali. 
With 8 illustrations in color. 

_"A_ revelation more profound and more subtle than 
'Gitanjali.' He opens to us the child-mind. . . . His 
revelation of the child-mind is richer, more complete, more 
convincing, than any of which we have had previous knowl- 
edge. "The Globe. $1.25 



"Flowers of poetry as fresh as sunrise." The Daily Mail. 

THE GARDENER 

Lyrics of Love and Life written in his youth. 
Translated by the author from the Original Bengali, 
with portrait.

translation, but as they stand they are of extreme beauty. 

. . They are simple, exalted, fragrant episodes and 

incidents of everyday transposed to faery. "The Daily Mail. 

$1.25 



"An allegory of love's meaning clear as a sunlit pool." 

The Observer. 

CHITRA 

Translated by the author from the Original Bengali.

Mr. Tagore's other work, linked to the fragrance of an old 
tale." Country Life. $1.00 



"A play from the heart." Boston Advertiser. 

THE POST OFFICE 

Translated by the author from the Original Bengali.

No one who cares for the best in modern literature should fail to become acquainted with the works of 
Rabindranath Tagore, the new Eastern poet. Get your Bookseller or the Librarian to show you all of Mr. 
Tagore's books and select for reading the one you think most likely to interest you. No one should be 
ignorant of his work.

DEMOCRACY AND THE THEATRE. 



We all wish art to be appreciated by every- 
body. The chief difference of opinion is over 
the question whether art should be brought 
down to the many or the many brought up to 
art. Most artists are earnest propagandists 
of beauty, especially of the beauty they are 
best able to see and record, but they rarely 
believe that it is given to more than a few to 
see beauty in any form. They are only less 
cynical than those popular purveyors of 
"amusement" who despise the public in order 
that they may not despise themselves. But 
occasionally there comes an artist, or, if not 
an artist, a playwright, or a critic of the 
drama, who believes not merely that art and 
democracy can meet and understand each 
other but that they have already done so. 
Mr. "William C. de Mille, the author of a num- 
ber of popular melodramas, is such a one. In 
the current issue of "The Yale Review" he 
maintains the thesis that the drama is a demo- 
cratic art, "whose first essential is the power 
of reaching the mass," and, hence, that the 
receipts of the box-office are a measure of the 
playwright 's skill and power : 

" Other arts are for the select few, each appeal- 
ing to its own comparatively small circle of fol- 
lowers. But the drama is for the many ; it is born 
not in the academy but in the heart of the great 
social centre; it is shaped not by the critic but by 
the demands of the audience; it is supported not 
by endowment and private subscription but by 
the people acting collectively; it is housed not in 
the museum but in buildings maintained by the 
public for this one purpose. It is the only art 
which the people themselves control, and, through 
that control, direct; it is essentially of the people,, 
by the people, and for the people; and we should! 
take this function into consideration in any dis- 
cussion of the art; for if the drama is to fulfill 
this basic condition it must be expressed in a form 
that the mass will accept and support. 

"... Because the drama is the art of the 
whole people, it is the art of all arts which can 1 
act most strongly upon the people for their devel- 
opment; the one art which can really be a great 
force in the social and intellectual progress of the- 
race. Indeed, the efficiency of drama to accom^ 
plish results is absolutely conditional upon its 
being directed and governed by the mass; and it 
follows necessarily that any influence which tends 
to take the government of drama away from the- 



THE DIAL, 



(Jan. I 



whole people is an unhealthy influence in that it is 
undemocratic." 

It seems perfectly clear that Mr. de Mille 
believes that the drama is not only relatively 
democratic, as compared with such other arts 
as prose fiction or music, but absolutely 
democratic. The only danger to the theatre 
that concerns him is the presence in the com- 
munity of a class which, "were it powerful 
enough, would menace the democracy of dra- 
matic art as any hierarchy of brains tends to 
limit progressive thought : 

" The ' highbrow ' would take from the people 
its right of democratic suffrage to compel the pub- 
lic to vote for plays nominated by the ' machine ' ; 
and this method of selection would undoubtedly 
corrupt drama as it does politics." 

We are surprised that Mr. de Mille 's politi- 
cal metaphor does not in the least remind him 
of the actual conditions which prevail in what 
he ironically calls the "commercial" theatre. 
A play is seldom presented on the commercial 
stage in this country unless one of the two- 
score producing managers in New York is 
persuaded that it will pay him to spend 
$10,000 on it. Mr. de Mille may believe that 
these gentlemen, whose decision is so gener- 
ally absolute that exceptions to it may be ig- 
nored as irrelevant, are peculiarly repre- 
sentative of the American democracy. But 
they suffer no such illusion ; they are frank to 
admit in their reflective moments that they 
cannot foretell the fate of a play one time out 
of three ; in a word, that when their sole con- 
cern is to choose the plays that the public 
wants they fail far more often than they 
succeed. 

We might go on to ask Mr. de Mille how he 
knows that the box-office receipts of a play 
are an index of the public's favor; how he 
can be certain that the money in the house is 
a tribute to the skill of the playwright and 
not to a matinee idol, or the leading lady's 
gowns, or a whim of public opinion. But 
there is a less doubtful point to consider. 
When a play has been accepted by a manager 
for production it is almost invariably pre- 
pared in New York and presented to a New 
York audience those familiar visits to New 
Haven or Atlantic City being in the nature 
of a dress rehearsal rather than of a pre- 
miere. The first-night audience is notoriously 
a special one; and the audiences immediately 
succeeding, which determine whether a play 
is to continue in the theatre or leave it for- 
ever, are only less special ; those who are not 



the guests of the management are chiefly citi- 
zens of New York who are willing and able to 
pay $2 to see a play about which very little is 
known. No one imagines that these persons 
are representative of America, of a democ- 
racy in which the average head of a family 
enjoys an income of perhaps $600 or $700 a 
year. 

Can anyone contemplate the process by 
which a play finally reaches a considerable 
number of the more prosperous of those 
Americans who live in or near the cities, and 
seriously argue that it is a democratic process 
by which is determined what sort of drama 
the American people most want? 

The case for the democracy of prose fiction, 
or of music, is a good deal stronger. A novel 
is so much more readily accepted for publica- 
tion than a play for production that many 
young men who would rather be writing plays 
turn to fiction on that account alone. For 
one thing, a novel requires only one-tenth the 
investment on the part of the entrepreneur. 
A novel has a year, or even more, in which to 
find its audience as against the play's two 
weeks, or three. A novel, when the fact that 
a copy can be read by several persons is 
taken into account, costs the consumer far 
less than seats in the theatre. For that mat- 
ter, the magazines have made entertainment 
in the form of prose fiction quite as cheap as 
entertainment in the form of moving pic- 
tures. The case of music is equally striking. 
Music in the form of grand opera visits only 
the half-dozen largest cities, and even there is 
offered only to those who have comfortable 
incomes ; but music travels wherever a piano, 
or a gramophone, or a flute may go. It might 
well be argued that music is the most demo- 
cratic of all the arts, and the one in which 
the masters are most generally appreciated. 
But no true art is in our day truly democratic. 

Some day a great art and the great multi- 
tude may come together in the theatre, which 
has now so little of either. In the meantime 
it ought to be understood that no art which 
requires the expenditure of any but the small- 
est sums on the part of those who enjoy it, can 
be truly democratic in its appeal. The art of 
the theatre among us is not of this descrip- 
tion and for that reason alone it does not 
exist for the majority of Americans. It is 
now, as it has always been except under the 
most extraordinary conditions in the past, the 
privilege of the few to go to the theatre.

THE DIAL. 



DOST01EFFSKY. 

Those of us who feel that the best modern 
fiction has been written in Russia are pro- 
foundly grateful to Mrs. Garnett. She has 
given us Tourguenieff and Tolstoi ; she is now 
at work on Dostoieffsky, offering us the first 
version in easy, idiomatic English that we 
have seen. Four volumes have appeared; 
others are promised, and we hope that she will 
not weary of her task until she has enabled us 
to enjoy a complete view of this disturbing 
and impressive figure, the most deeply Rus- 
sian of the Russians. Tourguenieff and Tol- 
stoi we accepted at once, finding little to quar- 
rel about in our critical estimates; but with 
Dostoieffsky the case has been different. The 
interval between those who praise and those 
who depreciate is greater than with other 
writers ; nor is this the most puzzling aspect 
of the affair. We cannot foresee the reaction 
of a given temperament. Thus, we hear 
Nietzsche (obviously a little bewildered) con- 
fessing that the chief exemplar, -in our time, 
of his "slave morality" is the only man who 
can teach him psychology. Yet Mr. Henry 
James, who is a psychologist or nothing, finds 
"Crime and Punishment" so little to his mind 
that he cannot finish it. If we turn to Amer- 
ica, we hear Professor Phelps asserting that 
"of all masters of fiction, both in Russia and 
elsewhere, he is the most truly spiritual. ' ' On 
the other hand, Mr. Paul Elmer More plunges 
us at once into the abyss by simply recording 
the impression he carried away from "Crime 
and Punishment. ' ' 

" Filth, disease, morbid dreams, bestiality, in- 
sanity, sodden crime, these are the natural pathway 
to the emancipation of the spirit; these in some 
mysterious way are spirituality. And the same les- 
son runs through Tolstoi and Strindberg and a 
dozen other moralists who are, as it were, the 
Prophets of our young." 

Mr. More not only brackets Tolstoi with 
Strindberg but throws in Mr. Shaw and Mr. 
Galsworthy also, by way of good measure. 
His looseness gives us a clue. This, we see, is 
no mere aesthetic protest; it is a moral judg- 
ment, delivered with all the heat our Amer- 
ican critics so often reserve for purely moral 
judgments. It may occur to us that this is 
only the story of Ibsen over again. Not in the 
least, since Dostoieffsky is orthodoxy itself, so 
thoroughly in the tradition that Nietzsche 
places him beside Pascal, "the only logical 
Christian. ' ' And if we turn to a Continental 
critic like Herr Otto Julius Bierbaum, we find 
him in an entirely different quandary. How 
is it possible, he asks, for us modern men to 
read this "primitive Christian" with sympa- 
thy? What ideal does he offer us? Passion- 



ate humility; utter renunciation of the self; 
the Christian virtues, in short! But we west- 
ern peoples have travelled by a very different 
road. We have achieved our destiny by an 
active, not to say ruthless, assertion of the 
will ; and this seems to us necessary and even 
right. We must admit that Dostoieffsky 's 
philosophy is deeply antipathetic. Only an 
art comparable to that of the Greeks and of 
Shakespeare can induce us to read him. 

The paradox involved in this vehement con- 
flict of opinion is not, after all, very difficult 
to resolve. We do not need to chatter of art 
for art's sake. As it happens, the group to 
which Dostoieffsky belonged never claimed 
the least license on the ground that they were 
artists. They only approached the moral prob- 
lem in the peculiar Russian way, which is 
vastly different from ours. It often occurs to 
us as we read the Russians that they would 
make uncommonly awkward dinner guests. 
They have not learned our caution, our conven- 
tional reserves. Their conversational taboo 
covers an amazingly small area. They are 
infinitely curious, and there is no question 
they will not put to themselves and to others. 
Nor do they see the least reason why the truth, 
once discovered, should be smuggled out of 
sight like a shameful thing. 

This stubborn integrity of the Russian soul 
strikes us at once in Tolstoi and in Dostoi- 
effsky. Tolstoi, in his old age, turns preacher. 
Very well, but Tolstoi the novelist remains to 
the end a vigorous truth-teller. He envisages 
every form of meanness, lust, cupidity, in- 
trigue, hypocrisy. His vision for these things 
is not less sure than De Maupassant's. His 
testimony, in other words, is not in the least 
invalidated by his peculiar notions of what 
constitutes a "good man." In Dostoieffsky, 
too, we find this supreme disinterestedness of 
the artist, co-existing with a genuinely fanati- 
cal view of things. His sense of evil is pro- 
found ; it obsesses and tortures him ; he cannot 
rest until he has sketched every detail of it 
into his macabre design. Yet it requires no 
power of divination to see how he loathes it. 
He is appalled and sickened, but he persists. 
Even a careless reader can see that he is not 
content to remain, like Balzac, the literary 
secretary of society Balzac into whose com- 
plex nature there was kneaded, along with 
transcendent genius, so much of the common 
Paris mud. We feel, as we read, how power- 
fully Balzac was seduced by wealth, luxury, 
worldly success, the glittering and empty show 
of things. Dostoieffsky is not under the 
dominion of such thoughts; but his intuitive 
understanding of how they work upon and 
alter the minds of others is profound and even 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1 



unique. Perhaps this is not wholly intuition, 
either. Knowledge may have come to him by 
more personal and direct ways, but with that 
we are not concerned. It is not easy to convey 
the peculiar quality of Dostoieff sky 's work, 
though it is easy enough to feel it. After read- 
ing a single novel, you say at once : Here is a 
writer who gives us something thrill ingly 
strange and new, a new kind of excitement of 
the nerves even for the effect of his work is 
not wholly psychic. He communicates to us 
the fever that so often tortures his characters, 
and something, too, of their uncanny sense of 
being on the verge of fresh and alarming spir- 
itual discoveries. An ambiguous look, a sig- 
nificant silence, a chance word these carry 
us at once out of our sunlit world into the 
crepuscular depths of his strange creations. 
Below the smooth surface, so familiar to our 
eyes, there lurk unguessed and awe-inspiring 
possibilities, as monsters lurk in the depths of 
the sea. 

For Dostoieffsky there are no commonplace 
souls ; nor for us either, while we read. His 
people are rarely sophisticated in our western 
sense; they are often incoherent, wild, the 
victims of a fixed idea, unable in spite of their 
incredible volubility to explain themselves 
rationally. They live in their emotions with 
an intensity that seems strange to our intellec- 
tualized habit. If we learn from them, it is 
rather new ways of feeling than of thinking ; 
and that, at least, we do learn. The vulgar 
and brutal murderers Dostoieffsky meets in 
Siberia teach him. secrets, so that penologists 
listen to him with respect. Each convict is an 
individual in more than the statistical sense. 
Neither cunning nor swagger deceives him. 
The real man, he knows, lurks uneasily below 
and is something quite different from the 
morose mask he wears. Well, it is for this real 
man that he lies in wait. The composite pic- 
ture of the criminal appears, in some sort, in 
' ' Crime and Punishment. ' ' 

In its machinery, this is but a sensational 
police novel. Many persons, we are told, can 
see in it nothing more. Raskolnikov, the 
youthful murderer of two old women, carries 
on his endless duel of wits with the police. 
For some, possibly, the interest lies solely in 
the external problem. Will Raskolnikov suc- 
ceed in extricating himself? Will he ulti- 
mately be caught in the cunning web that the 
police magistrate (surely a great figure of his 
kind) has spun ? One ventures to say that, for 
those who know how to read, the drama of 
"Crime and Punishment" is an inner drama 
wholly, a drama of almost unendurable in- 
tensity. Easkolnikov exhibits to the full the 
singular insensibility which Dostoieffsky ob- 



served in the murderers of Siberia. He is as 
unlike Bill Sikes as possible; he knows no 
remorse. But always there is the consuming 
fear of detection, the terror of the law. And 
above and beyond that, there is the fear of his 
own inadequacy to meet the test of character 
he has imposed ; for his crime is, in a way, an 
experiment he is conducting on himself. He 
can continue to believe in himself only so long 
as he finds the courage and the skill to defy 
society. His pride fails; his life crumbles 
about him, and he is obliged to reconstruct it 
on another plane. Siberia is thus but an epi- 
sode in the tale of his regeneration. 

If we turn from "Crime and Punishment" 
to ' ' The Brothers Karamazov, ' ' we find a book 
at once more formidable and more truly typi- 
cal. Dostoieffsky here makes no concessions 
to our laziness. It exhibits all his character- 
istic faults, of which we hear so much, on a 
gigantic scale. It is appallingly prolix, and 
contains material (some of it superb) that is 
wholly extraneous. It exposes to our view 
such an inferno of vice, squalor, bestiality, and 
disease as Dante never imagined. The Kara- 
mazovs are a group of a father and three sons. 
The father and the eldest son are deeply 
marked with the characteristic Karamazov 
taint : sensuality has reached in them almost 
the pitch of insanity. The book opens on the 
struggle of these two to possess a prostitute; 
murder is clearly in the air and is presently 
realized. The second son is at once subtler and 
more sophisticated than most of Dostoieffsky 's 
people, but he, too, is evil. Only the youngest 
has escaped the Karamazov taint, and he, with 
the "Idiot" of another novel, serves to give 
us his creator's idea of a "good man. " 

The method is that of drama; there is no 
description of motive, no explanation. Dostoi- 
effsky simply unrolls before us in a succession 
of superb scenes the epic conflict in this tragic 
family. After a few chapters, we fancy we 
know his people; but this is an illusion fos- 
tered by the shallow judgments we allow our- 
selves. Dostoieffsky has a profounder sense 
of spiritual values. Little by little, these 
wretches reveal themselves, turning out under 
our eyes the last secret folds in their depraved 
souls. They are appalling, and yet they are 
not that alone. They must know the truth 
about themselves, for they are tortured both 
by what they already know and by what they 
only suspect. The candor with which they 
confess the worst, has about it, after all, some- 
thing not ignoble. The eldest brother calls 
himself an "insect," one of the noxious crea- 
tures cursed by God with the very delirium of 
desire. He rails at himself endlessly ; his self- 
contempt is boundless ; he exists in a perpetual 



1915] 



THE DIAL, 



hell. Is it possible that he is at bottom a 
hypocrite, shielding himself from the bitter- 
ness of ultimate self-knowledge? And the 
fierceness with which the second son lays hold 
of his conscience is a revelation in subtlety, for 
Dostoieffsky brings to bear on the problem of 
moral casuistry an intellectual energy that 
tries the brain like dialectics. 

It has been urged that in all this we hear 
not the talk of average men, but the inexorable 
whisperings of the accusing conscience. And 
there are those w r ho complain that this is not 
realism. But if realism is to concern itself 
with surfaces only, how can it minister in any 
satisfying way to our curiosity? Surely the 
easiest way for it to become false and mislead- 
ing, is to restrict its play too narrowly. At all 
events, Dostoieffsky has justified, for some of 
us, both his method and his material. The 
world he reveals to us may be peopled with 
creatures mean, diseased, abnormal, drunken, 
the prey of every evil passion and perversity 
it does not matter. We feel, as we read, 
that they are proper subjects for tragedy, and 
even for the greatest tragedy. 

One comes from this great Russian writer 
with an uneasy realization of the superficiality 
of our average judgments, the thinness of our 
spiritual experiences. He increases our sense 
of wonder and our capacity for awe. And he 
adds immeasurably to our understanding of 
the pathetic dignity of the downtrodden and 
oppressed. He has found for their dumbness 
a voice, poignant in its brooding sorrow and 
lovely in its rich compassion. He touches both 
the heights and the depths, remaining indif- 
ferent only to that middle ground on which 
most of us choose, for our comfort, to live out 



lives. 



GEORGE BERNARD DONLIN. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A VOLTAIREAN VIEW OF WAR may be of in- 
terest at this time. Some one has called atten- 
tion to the illuminating discourse between 
Micromegas, gigantic dweller on one of the 
planets revolving about Sirius, and a company 
of our philosophers, as reported in the seventh 
chapter of the amusing fantasy bearing the 
name of the above-mentioned Sirian visitor. 
A free translation of a part of this conversa- 
tion is here offered. After congratulating his 
terrestrial hearers on being so small and add- 
ing that, with so manifest a subordination of 
matter to mind, they must pass their lives in 
the pleasures of intellectual pursuits and 
mutual love a veritable spiritual existence 
the stranger is thus answered by one of the 
philosophers: "We have more matter than 
we need for the accomplishment of much evil, 



if evil comes from matter, and more mind than 
we need if evil comes from mind. Do you 
know that at the present moment there are a 
hundred thousand fools of our species, wear- 
ing caps, who are killing a hundred thousand 
other animals wearing turbans, or who are 
themselves being massacred by the latter, and 
that almost everywhere on earth this is the 
immemorial usage?" The Sirian, properly 
shocked, demands the reason of these horrible 
encounters between creatures so puny. "It 
is all about a pile of dirt no bigger than your 
heel," is the reply. "Not that any one of 
these millions of men marching to slaughter 
has the slightest claim to this pile of dirt ; the 
only question is whether it shall belong to a 
certain man known as Sultan or to another 
having the title of Czar. Neither of the two 
has ever seen or ever will see the patch of 
ground in dispute, and hardly a single one of 
these animals engaged in killing one another 
has ever seen the animal for whom they are 
thus employed." Again the stranger ex- 
presses his horror, and declares he has half a 
mind to annihilate with a kick or two the 
whole batch of ridiculous assassins. "Don't 
give yourself the trouble," is the rejoinder; 
"they will accomplish their own destruction 
fast enough. Know that ten years hence not a 
hundredth part of these miserable wretches 
will be left alive ; and know, too, that even if 
they were not to draw the sword, hunger, 
exhaustion, or intemperance would make an 
end of most of them. Besides, they are not the 
ones to punish, but rather those sedentary 
barbarians who, from the ease and security of 
their private apartments, and while their din- 
ner is digesting, order the massacre of a mil- 
lion men, and then solemnly return thanks to 
God for the achievement." The visitor from 
Sirius is moved with pity for a race of beings 
presenting such astonishing contrasts. 


THE QUALITY OF NATURALNESS IN STYLE is 

something that defies analysis. Let one writer 
express himself with a certain degree of what 
may be called elegance, and the artificiality 
of it is at once apparent, whereas the same 
measure of rhetorical finish and ornament in 
another writer will seem entirely natural. 
The first writer calls up the image of a per- 
son dressed in his seldom-used and carefully 
brushed best clothes; the second represents 
the man who is habitually well-dressed and 
always at ease in his perfectly fitting raiment. 
Just what it is that constitutes the ' ' Sunday- 
go-to-meeting " character of the one suit of 
clothes, and the every-day-in-the-week look of 
the other, even though both be equally correct 
and stylish, it is impossible to say. Probably 



THE DIAL 



[ Jan. 1 



there is something in the manner of wearing 
the clothes that makes the difference. Dr. 
Garnett makes use of this sartorial simile in 
closing his interesting "Remarks on American 
and English Fiction" in the December "At- 
lantic Monthly. ' ' He says : ' ' Another simile 
that obtrudes itself in reading many Ameri- 
can novels is that of a visit from kindly folk 
who have come to a gathering in Sunday 
clothes and with Sunday manners. The peo- 
ple's week-day spontaneity is replaced by a 
cautious preoccupation with their deport- 
ment, as to how they are expected to behave, 
and everything that they say is a little forced. 
Even in the admirable novels of Mrs. Wharton 
and Anne Douglas Sedgwick the conflict so 
often depicted between the idealism of the 
characters and their ordinary earthly motives 
gives one an odd feeling that both their morals 
and their manners are like tightly cut clothes 
in which people cannot be quite at ease." 
Whether or not this is harsh criticism, it is 
enforced by an almost ludicrously apt quota- 
tion from one of our leading novelists. 


A VERSATILE NONOGENARiAN, remarkable for 
the range and variety of his scholarly tastes 
and literary accomplishments, died recently at 
Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The Rev. Dr. Addi- 
son Ballard, who was born at Framingham 
ninety-two years ago last October, held from 
first to last so many professorships in so many 
colleges and universities, east and west, that 
a list of them would only be a bewilderment 
to the reader. Suffice it to say that at Wil- 
liams College, where he took his bachelor's 
degree at the age of twenty, he taught rhetoric 
in his early life, and at the New York Uni- 
versity he held the chair of logic in the last 
years of his teaching, from 1893 to 1904, with 
professorships of mathematics, astronomy, 
Latin and Greek, moral philosophy, and other 
branches scattered in between. His long 
course of teaching furnished him with mate- 
rial for a book entitled "Arrows, or Teaching 
a Fine Art." and his experience as pastor of 
churches in his native state and Michigan 
qualified him to write "From Talk to Text" 
and "From Text to Talk," also "Through the 
Sieve," and other contributions to serious lit- 
erature of a reflective or moral tone. A val- 
iant pedestrian, he accomplished the feat of 
climbing Monument Mountain (which in- 
spired Bryant's poem of that name) in his 
eighty-ninth year, and up to the very end he 
set a pace in the streets of Pittsfield that many 
a younger man might have found it difficult to 
equal. One likes to hear of his daily walks 
and his daily practice of memorizing some 
classical phrase or some bit of verse. Daily, 



too, he made it a point to write something, not 
necessarily for publication, we infer, but 
rather to keep his pen from rusting. For the 
last eight years he had lived with his son, Mr. 
Harlan H. Ballard, librarian of the Berkshire 
Athenaeum, which is Pittsfield 's public library. 


AN ARTIST FOR ART'S SAKE is revealed, unex- 
pectedly to some, in the banker, philanthro- 
pist, and veteran of our Civil War, Major 
Henry Lee Higginson, as briefly portrayed in 
Mr. M. A. DeWolfe Howe's history of "The 
Boston Symphony Orchestra." In his early 
twenties this octogenarian lover of music and 
generous provider of the best in that art for 
his city wrote to his father from Vienna, after 
referring to the possibility of adopting music- 
teaching as a calling: "But the pleasure, 
pure and free from all disagreeable conse- 
quences or afterthoughts, of playing and still 
more of singing myself, is indescribable. In 
Rome I took about eight lessons of a capital 
master, and I used to enjoy intensely the 
singing to his accompaniment my exercises 
and some little Neapolitan songs. My rea- 
sons for studying harmony are manifest. I 
cannot properly understand music without 
doing so; moreover, it is an excellent exercise 
for the mind. As to writing music, I have 
nothing to say ; but it is not my expectation. 
It is like writing poetry; if one is prompted 
to do so, and has anything to say, he does it. 
But I entirely disavow any such intention or 
aim in my present endeavor, and this I wish 
to be most clearly expressed and understood, 
should any one ask about me. / am studying 
for my own good and pleasure. ... It is only 
carrying out your own darling idea of making 
an imperishable capital in education. My 
money may fly away; my knowledge cannot. 
One belongs to the world, the other to me." 
The accident, a bodily injury grievous for the- 
young man to bear, which later led to Mr. 
Higginson 's devoting himself to business 
rather than to music, adds a pathetic interest 
to the too-brief biography forming the open- 
ing chapter of Mr. Howe's book. 



A SCOTTISH LOGICIAN of more than Scottish 
fame, successor to Sir William Hamilton as 
professor of logic and metaphysics in Edin- 
burgh University, and author of many books 
relating to his department of study, died a 
few weeks ago, rich in honors and full of 
years. Alexander Campbell Fraser was born 
September 3, 1819, and finished his education 
at the university where he was to help educate 
others for almost half a century. He was pro- 
fessor of logic at New College, Edinburgh,, 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



from 1846 to 1856 ; editor of the ' ' North British 
Review" from 1850 to 1857 ; professor of logic 
and metaphysics, in succession to Hamilton, 
who had just died, from 1856 to 1891 ; profes- 
sor emeritus after closing his active labors in 
the university; and throughout his years of 
maturity he wrote philosophical essays, biogra- 
phies of noted philosophers, and other books 
of some note. His ' ' Life and Letters of Berke- 
ley," published in 1871, was his first consid- 
erable work, and he also wrote the life of 
Thomas Reid, contributed the volumes on 
Locke and Berkeley to the series of "Philo- 
sophical Classics," put forth a two-volume 
"Philosophy of Theism," and at eighty-five 
gave to the w r orld his "Biographia Philo- 
sophica, a Personal Retrospect." His recrea- 
tions, says "Who's Who," were "country life 
and visits to scenes of biographical or histori- 
cal interest. ' ' A fine example he certainly was 
of the scholarship of the northern Athens. 



DATA FOR FUTURE WAR-HISTORIANS are being 
systematically collected and preserved by the 
Harvard University Library, which appeals to 
alumni and others to aid in the work. Books, 
of which already there are more than a few, 
war maps, files of newspapers from the war 
zone and from neutral countries, official de- 
spatches, and other like material are included 
in the collection, which already is at the 
service of students. Among newspapers, the 
library is receiving the London "Times," 
Westminster "Gazette," the Paris "Temps" 
and "Figaro," the Milan "Corriere della 
Sera," the Vienna "Neue Freie Presse," the 
Berlin "Allgemeine Zeitung, " and the Mu- 
nich "Neueste Nachrichten. " The American 
colony at Munich, or some of its members, 
made notes of the earlier events of the war, 
and these notes have been given to the library, 
together with daily papers from Lucerne, 
Zurich, and Geneva. These and other for- 
eign journals are regarded as especially im- 
portant sources of information. But what a 
mass of mutually contradictory and often 
unblushingly false information the future 
historian will have to sift as he wades through 
all this accumulation of reading matter !

REVIVED INTEREST IN RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND 
LITERATURE seems to be indicated by recent 
action at the University of Chicago, where, 
under the terms of a gift from Mr. Charles 
R. Crane, instruction in these branches is 
about to begin. In other words, Mr. Samuel 
Northrup Harper, eldest son of the late Presi- 
dent Harper, and graduate of the University 
in the class of 1902, has been called from his 
post as lecturer in the School of Russian Stud- 



ies at Liverpool University, and has been made 
an assistant professor at his home university, 
with the Russian language and institutions as 
his special department. The new courses will, 
it is expected, begin with the winter quarter, 
and in the spring there will probably be 
offered courses in Russian literature and his- 
tory. Books and periodicals relating to all 
these courses will be added to the library, and 
additional lecturers from Russia will be en- 
gaged. Mr. Harper has devoted himself since 
graduation to Russian studies, much of the 
time in Russia itself, and has edited a Russian 
reader, a substantial volume of about four 
hundred pages issued by the University of 

Chicago Press. 



A DELINQUENT BOOK-BORROWER is the heavi- 
ness of the too-trusting lender. From West- 
boro, Massachusetts, comes the report of a 
library book taken out more than a century 
ago in 1811, to be exact and only the 
other day returned, whether by the great- 
grandchild or great-great-grandchild (or still 
more remote descendant) of the borrower, we 
cannot say. But there is cheer to despairing 
librarians in this remarkable recovery of what 
must have been long ago entered on the rec- 
ords as a hopelessly lost volume. Paraphras- 
ing the good old hymn, the worried head of 
the circulation department can henceforth 
comfort himself (or, more often, herself) 
with the assurance that while the lamp holds 
out to burn, the long-lost volume may return. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



AN AUTHOR'S PROTEST. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a recent issue of THE DIAL, in a paragraph 
speaking of my book, " The Greek Spirit," are 
many misrepresentations in point of fact. Four 
of the misrepresentations prompt me to send you 
the following: 

First : Your reviewer writes, " We find an 
American thumb-print in the use of humans in the 
sense of men and women." Humans, " in the sense 
of men and women," is an old English word. I 
have met it, I think, in a black-letter Holinshed 
printed in London in 1584-5; certainly in other 
old English books. The reason of the use of the 
word in old times and now is clear it has the 
advantage of connoting what no other word in our 
noble English speech explicitly connotes. If your 
reviewer will turn to the word in "A New English 
Dictionary," edited by Sir James Murray, he will 
find a quotation from Lowell to the effect that 
George Chapman, contemporary of Shakespeare 
and Ben Jonson, habitually used " humanes," in 
its common meaning, in his translation of Homer. 
Your reviewer will also find humans, " in the sense 
of men and women," in writings of the Scottish 



10 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1 



Robert Louis Stevenson and of Englishmen of our 
day. 

Second : Your reviewer also finds " an unhy- 
phened, half-German locution in the ugly words 
their art gift." Most excellent publications in 
England as well as in this country have used such 
words as art, race, without hyphen, adjectively, 
these past fifty years; centuries longer, if the 
phrase art magique is included. Art, has even 
come into such popular uses as " art union," " art 
squares." 

Third : " Subjects and predicates do not gener- 
ally play hide-and-seek with the reader as in this: 
' Cereals grew in sunlit tillage, the grape sacred 
through its use in the religions of many peoples, 
the gray-green olive, other esculent fruits, and 
horned cattle grazed in meadows dotted by bene- 
factive forest trees.' " Subject and predicate play 
no hide-and-seek in this quoted sentence. It is 
plain, legitimate, parsable by a schoolboy. 

Fourth: Your reviewer speaks of competition 
with others. My book strives with none. Its plan 
and its philosophy, its content determining dis- 
tinctive features of a race spirit and tracing the 
evolution of that race spirit from earliest begin- 
nings to the end, show that the book is different 
from what he terms my, or its, " dangerous rivals." 
As to Professor Basil Gildersleeve's beautiful 
" Hellas and Hesperia," your reviewer should re- 
call that, upon its publication, a paragraphing 
fellow of his pronounced upon it with all the 
fatuous impertinence of incompetents of his craft.

MOMMSEN AND THE WAR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Much has been written of the influence of 
Nietzsche, as adapted and popularized by Treit- 
schke, in creating the conditions out of which 
sprang the present war. While that influence 
undoubtedly has been great, it by no means marks 
the beginning of German aspirations to world 
hegemony. When the development of this motive 
shall have been traced, I venture to predict that 
Mommsen's glorification of Roman imperialism 
will be found to have been an important factor. 
From many passages in his "History of Rome," 
which might be quoted in illustration of this point, 
I select three, which may be found on pp. 3, 6, 
and 440, respectively, in Vol. V. of the American 
edition of 1900 : 

" By virtue of the law, that a people which has 
grown into a state absorbs its neighbors who are in 
political nonage, and a civilized people absorbs its 
neighbors who are in intellectual nonage by virtue 
of this law, which is as universally valid and as much 
a law of nature as the law of gravity the Italian 
nation (the only one in antiquity which was able to 
combine a superior political development and a supe- 
rior civilization . . .) was entitled to reduce to sub- 
jection the Greek states of the East which were ripe 
for destruction, and to dispossess the peoples of 
lower grades of culture in the West. . . ." 

"There was a direct political necessity for Rome 
to meet the perpetually threatened invasion of the 
Germans . . . beyond the Alps, and to construct a 
rampart there which should secure the peace of the 



Roman world. But even this important object was 
not the highest and ultimate reason for which Gaul 
was conquered by Caesar. When the old home had 
become too narrow for the Roman burgesses and they 
were in danger of decay, the senate's policy of Italian 
conquest saved them from ruin. Now the Italian 
home had become in its turn too narrow; once more 
the state languished under the same social evils re- 
peating themselves in similar fashion upon a grander 
scale. It was a brilliant idea, a grand hope, which 
led Caesar over the Alps the idea and the confident 
expectation that he should gain there for his fellow- 
burgesses a new boundless home, and regenerate the 
state a second time by placing it upon a broader 
basis." 

" For Rome alone history not merely performed 
miracles, but also repeated its miracles, and twice 
cured the internal crisis, which in the state itself was 
incurable, by regenerating the state. There was 
doubtless much corruption in this regeneration; as 
the union of Italy was accomplished over the ruins of 
the Samnite and Etruscan nations, so the Mediterra- 
nean monarchy built itself upon the ruins of count- 
less states and tribes once living and vigorous; but 
it was a corruption out of which sprang a new 
growth. . . . What was pulled down for the sake of 
the new building, was merely the secondary nationali- 
ties which had long since been marked out for de- 
struction by the levelling hand of civilization." 

Much could be said in comment upon these ex- 
tracts but their application is sufficiently obvious. 
Repeatedly does Mommsen assert the right of con- 
quest that belongs to the union of superior organi- 
zation in the state and superior " kultur " in the 
people. The relation of the war to the subjective 
desire to check the growth of social democracy I 
leave to the reader. Mommsen's " History " was 
completed in 1857. In his later life he deprecated 
the growth of militarism, but the harvest was the 
legitimate fruit of the seed that he had himself 
sown. At -the annual meeting of the American 
Society of International Law last April, Mr. 
Charles Francis Adams quoted the first of the 
passages given above and christened its content 
" Mommsen's law." He remarked that it mas- 
queraded under various aliases, such as " manifest 
destiny" and "benevolent assimilation," and he 
might have added " peaceful penetration " and 
" international right of eminent domain." As 
Viscount Bryce has recently said : " The war is a 
struggle between ideals the ideal of a military 
state resolved to dominate all the neighboring 
countries and the ideal of peaceful communities 
dwelling in tranquillity under the protection of 
treaties." The fact that British interests are bound 
up in the triumph of the latter ideal does not alter 
the case. So are the interests of civilization.

METRICAL, FREEDOM AND THE 
CONTEMPORARY POET.* 



Poets have grown either less bold or more 
courteous than they were in the days when 
the authors of ''The Dunciad" or of "English 
Bards and Scotch Reviewers" blackened 
many a fellow- writer's face with adroit mud. 
One need hardly bemoan the fact, since the 
admirable wit of those productions barely 
compensated for their execrable taste. But 
enthusiasm for even impersonal literary con- 
troversy seems lacking to-day; and differ- 
ences of opinion so sharp that they might once 
have divided the poets into two hostile camps 
now scarcely serve to embroil them with their 
next-door neighbors. 

Only thus can one explain the fact that open 
warfare has not broken out between the pro- 
ponents of the lately resurrected theory of 
vers libre and the adherents of the orthodox 
type of regularly rhythmical metres. A genu- 
ine difference of opinion and of temperament 
is involved. On the one side stand the writers 
who demand complete freedom of rhythm as a 
requisite for expressing the free and irregular 
contours of emotion; and on the other side 
stand those who regard metrical regularity as 
the sole instrument by which high emotion can 
be given successful expression. 

Mr. Arthur Stringer, in the Foreword of his 
new volume, "Open Water," states the first 
of these positions with some elaboration. The 
traditional technique of rhythm and rhyme is, 
he believes, as hampering and anachronistic as 
the chain-armour of the Middle Ages would 
be to a modern soldier ; the poet of to-day is 
unable to achieve natural expression under 
such a handicap. Mr. Stringer points out 
very truly that the almost boundless liberty 
afforded by blank verse is not available to the 
poet except for large, almost epical, themes; 
therefore, in actual practice, rhymed verse 
alone remains to him for "the utterance of 
those more intimate moods and those subjec- 
tive experiences which may be described as 
characteristically modern." But rhymed 
verse forces him to "sacrifice content for 
form," and has "left him incapable of what 
may be called abandonment. ' ' Even regular- 
ity of rhythm, where no rhyme is present, 
"crowds his soul into a geometrically designed 
mould."

cisco: A. M. Robertson. 



The objection to Mr. Stringer's plausible 
theory lies in his own admission that formal 
rhythm and rhyme supply "definiteness of 
outline" and "give design to the lyric." 
Without the agency of a fixed rhythm, it is 
almost impossible to achieve those recurrences, 
pulses, waves, and echoes whose function in 
poetry is no adventitious or superfluous one. 
A fixed cadence alone can serve as a base for 
all the musical variations that the poet may 
wish to employ ; and his success here is vital. 
Deprive "Lycidas" of its antiphonal organ- 
roll of sound, its great succession of mounded 
harmonies, and it would be nothing. The 
design is the poem. The metrical form is the 
very condition, the true means, of the poet's 
success. That spontaneous expression of emo- 
tion for which Mr. Stringer pleads is not 
likely to result in poetry at all; what turns 
raw feeling into poetry is precisely the com- 
pression of the material into an artful pat- 
tern, an expressive structure, an intelligible 
design. Not sobs, but music whose tone has 
sobs buried in it, not laughter, but the song 
that dances with winged feet, come within 
the categories of art. In the process of turn- 
ing emotion into art, some loss has to be suf- 
fered ; but the loss is not so large as Mr. 
Stringer would have us believe. To sacrifice 
content for form, as he tells us we now do, 
would indeed be lamentable ; but on the other 
hand, to sacrifice form for content means sim- 
ply to break the bottle that might have held 
at least a part of the wine. The competent 
craftsman does not, however, have to choose 
between these evils. Form is his opportunity, 
not his prison, as some of Mr. Stringer's 
own earlier lyrics prove. Most writers would 
agree that the exigencies of rhyme suggest 
felicitous excursions of thought far more fre- 
quently than they inhibit the exact statement 
of an idea in all its original integrity. The 
practiced poet learns not to formulate his idea 
too rigidly in advance, but to let it develop 
and grow like an unfolding vine over and 
through the lattice of his metrical trellis. 

After all, the sole criterion by which any 
artistic theory can be judged is its success in 
practice. Mr. Stringer's practice of vers libre 
is not a convincing exemplification of the vir- 
tue of his theory. One of the best, and also 
one of the most regular, of his poems is the 
following, entitled "The Wild Swans Pass": 
" In the dead of night 
You turned in your troubled sleep 
As you heard the wild swans pass ; 
And then you slept again. 

" You slept 

While a new world swam beneath 
That army of eager wings,

While plainland and slough and lake 
Lay wide to those outstretched throats, 
While the lone far Lights allured 
That phalanx of passionate breasts. 

" And I who had loved you more 
Than a homing bird loves flight, 
1 watched with an ache for freedom, 
I rose with a need for life, 
Knowing that love had passed 
Into its unknown North ! " 

It is hard not to feel that even this finely con- 
ceived picture needs the melody of a more defi- 
nitely patterned form, that we shall forget 
this nebulous strain to-morrow, but that if it 
had been woven through the rhythm of a true 
music, however hesitant its beat, we could 
never forget it. 

Miss Amy Lowell, also, has provided her 
volume, "Sword Blades and Poppy Seed," 
with a Preface in which she raises the question 
of metrics. "Unrhymed cadence," as she 
prefers to call vers libre, differs from the 
rhythms of ordinary prose "by being more 
curved, and containing more stress." This 
statement justly suggests that it is to prose 
and not to regularly rhythmical verse that we 
must look for the prototype of vers libre. Miss 
Lowell has used "unrhymed cadence" for 
many, but not all, of her poems ; and she ex- 
pressly disclaims being an exclusive partisan 
of either form. Technique of versification is 
only one of many techniques that interest her. 
Her most notable quality appears in the open- 
ing passage of the volume. 
" A drifting, April, twilight sky, 

A wind that blew the puddles dry, 

And slapped the river into waves 

That ran and hid among the staves 

Of an old wharf. A watery light 

Touched bleak the granite bridge, and white 

Without the slightest tinge of gold, 

The city shivered in the cold. 

All day my thoughts had lain as dead, 

Unborn and bursting in my head. 

From time to time I wrote a word 

With lines and circles overscored. 

My table seemed a graveyard, full 

Of coffins waiting burial . . ." 

The sharply etched tones and contours of this 
picture are characteristic of the author's work. 
Sometimes, however, an extreme carelessness, 
very different from that painstaking care 
which she praises in the "clear-eyed French- 
men," mars her verse. "Were" does not re- 
spectably rhyme with "where," nor "vault" 
with "tumult," nor "Max" with "climax," 
nor "time" with "thyme"; yet this entire 
group of deformities occurs within the space 
of nineteen consecutive lines. This is no mere 
breaking of technical rules ; it is the destruc- 
tion of beauty. If the requirements of rhyme 



so irk a writer, it would be better to follow 
Mr. Stringer's example and use vers libre 
only. In ' ' unrhymed cadence, ' ' Miss Lowell 's 
cadences are sometimes extremely delicate, as 
in "The Captured Goddess": 
" Over the housetops, 

Above the rotating chimney-pots, 

I have seen a shiver of amethyst, 

And blue and cinnamon have flickered 

A moment 

At the far end of a dusty street. 

" Through sheeted rain 
Has come a lustre of crimson, 
And I have watched moonbeams 
Hushed by a film of palest green. 

" It was her wings, 

Goddess ! 

Who stepped over the clouds, 

And laid her rainbow feathers 

Aslant on the currents of the air. . . ." 
But to some readers, this passage will be 
merely an added proof of the fact that good 
vers libre is absolutely not so expressive as 
good rhythmical verse. Several passages on a 
similar theme in Shelley's "Prometheus Un- 
bound" confirm such an opinion; nor is the 
comparison an unfair one, since every writer 
must endure the rivalry of the whole body of 
his predecessors. "Unrhymed cadence" at its 
best can hardly convey that intensity of effect 
which is poetry's peculiar function; certain 
clear emotional heights are as impossible of 
attainment by it as by prose. 

Not so pliant, not so accurate, not even so 
free a medium for expression as the old 
rhythms ! To say a thing directly, to cry it 
out, is not necessarily to express it. The 
complexities of rhythm and rhyme are not 
always a hindrance to the expression of com- 
plex thoughts. The poet's need is sometimes 
best served by that great world of musical 
signals and emotional calls which is at the 
disposal of him who accepts the convention 
that governs rhythmical verse, and employs 
this very convention as the instrument for 
evoking emotions that could never be evoked 
by naturalistic means. The supreme element 
of poetry comes into being only with that 
peculiar lift and flight which the disembodied 
imagination can take on the wings of formal 
geometrical beauty. 

Miss Harriet Monroe, in her newly collected 
volume, "You and I," experiments with vers 
libre; but the pieces written in this style are 
few in number. Modernity in other than 
metrical matters chiefly marks her ambitions. 
In many of her poems she attempts with 
seriousness and devotion to consecrate poetry 
to the task of expressing modern industrial 
life. "The Hotel," "Night in State Street,"

' ' The Turbine ' ' are the titles of the first three 
poems in the book; and their names indicate 
something of the author's aim. It is not 
wholly demonstrable that so specifically pur- 
posed an interest in the concrete and not 
always significant aspects of modernity is the 
best way of attaining this end. There is in 
such an effort too much of the conscious intel- 
ligence and too little of those blind tides of 
passionate understanding which alone pour 
greatness into poetry. Yet these are rather 
well-known poems, which have given pleasure 
to many "people of high degree"; and it is 
perhaps a work of supererogation, or worse, 
of arrogance, to criticize unfavorably cer- 
tain conceptions that find place in them. The 
critic must, however, unsociably go his own 
chosen way, lighted by his own lantern. In 
some instances he may find himself unable to 
follow Miss Monroe. To view the turbine, 
its purring revolutions, its hidden lightnings, 
its moods and rebellions, as a proud tempes- 
tuous woman, seems an example of that kind of 
poetic imagination which does not interpret 
but rather encumbers the true essence of its 
theme. In the poem "Our Canal," also, the 
lines 

" Panama, ribbon twist 

That ties the continents together." 
are surely a bad, a false, a really unimagina- 
tive way of seeing the world of things as they 
are. 

Miss Monroe's best work is not in this vein. 
Here she seems like a Christina Rossetti led by 
an infelicitous chance into an alien and un- 
mastered world of modern mechanics, where 
her very genuine powers are largely useless. 
Her best accomplishment is in the vein of less 
ambassadorial utterance, in personal poems 
where she subdues a smaller world more per- 
fectly to the service of poetry. Take the fol- 
lowing sonnet: 

" Look on the dead. Stately and pure he lies 

Under the white sheet's marble folds. For him 

The solemn bier, the scented chamber dim, 

The sacred hush, the bowed heads of the wise, 

The slow pomp, the majestical disguise 

Of haughty death, the conjurer even for him, 

Poor trivial one, pale shadow on the rim, 

Whom life marked not, but death may not despise. 

Now is he level with the great; no king 

Enthroned and crowned more royal is, more sure 

Of the world's reverence. Yesterday this thing 

Was but a man, mortal and insecure ; 

Now chance and change their homage to him bring 

And he is one with all things that endure." 

This dignified passage, written probably some 

time ago, may serve to remind the reader once 

more of the value of the very old and, as Miss 

Monroe herself now believes, "exhausted" 

sonnet form. In "The Wonder of It" also, 



Miss Monroe has no difficulty in aptly turning 
conventional rhyme and rhythm to her own 
fantastic and original uses : 

" How wild, how witch-like weird that life should 

be! 

That the insensate rock dared dream of me, 
And take to bursting out and burgeoning 

Oh, long ago yo ho ! 
And wearing green ! How stark and strange a thing 

That life should be ! 

" Oh, mystic mad, a rigadoon of glee, 

That dust should rise, and leap alive, and flee 

Afoot, awing, and shake the deep with cries 

Oh, far away yo hay ! 
What moony masque, what arrogant disguise 

That life should be!" 

Mr. George Sterling, an experienced metrist, 
trained in the great lyric tradition of the past, 
is wholly faithful to rhythmical verse in his 
new volume "Beyond the Breakers." All the 
freedom that he needs he takes for hims_elf 
within the compass of regular rhythms. How 
little cramped he is, a passage from his 
"Browning Centenary Ode" may attest: 

" vision wide and keen ! 
Which knew, untaught, that pains to joyance are 

As night unto the star 
That on the effacing dawn must burn unseen. 

And thou didst know what meat 

Was torn to give us milk, 
What countless worms made possible the silk 

That robes the mind, what plan 
Drew as a bubble from old infamies 

And fen-pools of the past 
The shy and many-colored soul of man. 

Yea ! thou hast seen the lees 
In that rich cup we lift against the day, 
Seen the man-child at his disastrous play 

His shafts without a mark, 
His fountains flowing downward to the dark, 

His maiming and his bars, 

Then turned to see 

His vatic shadow cast athwart the stars, 
And his strange challenge to infinity. . . ." 

It is interesting to speculate as to how the 
devotee of vers libre would have gone about' 
attaining this lift and soar of flight. It may 
be doubted if he could possibly do so except by 
falling back upon that fairly regular variety 
of free metre which Matthew Arnold and 
Milton sometimes employed. To achieve that 
peculiar thing which we call poetry, a sus- 
taining, emotion-heightening recurrence of 
rhythm is as indispensable as music is to opera. 
The sole debatable question is, how regular 
must the recurrence be to produce the desired 
trance-like effect? Vers libre often comes 
perilously near to the less insistent rhythms of 
prose, and loses the characteristic power of 
poetry thereby.

ENGL.AXD AXD THE AMERICAX 
REVOLUTION.* 



In 1834 George Bancroft published the first 
volume of his ' ' History of the Colonization of 
the United States," which was followed eigh- 
teen years later by a " History of the Revolu- 
tion in North America. ' ' For a long time the 
spirit of George Bancroft animated the writing 
of American history, and even after two gener- 
ations the influence of his early pioneer work 
is still to be reckoned with. Bancroft came 
well prepared to his work and while in the 
diplomatic service had unusual opportunities 
to collect materials for the continuation of his 
great undertaking ; but in the first half of the 
nineteenth century, when the memories of two 
wars with England were still fresh in the 
popular mind, it was scarcely possible to view 
the events of the later colonial period in their 
true light. In recent years the researches of 
Professor Osgood, Mr. G. L. Beer, and others 
have in a large measure discredited the con- 
clusions that Bancroft stated with such patri- 
otic fervor : it has come to be seen that there 
were deeper causes than the quarrel over taxa- 
tion for the separation from England, and 
that it was probably the complexities of the 
imperial problem rather than mean-spirited 
politics that led the English government to 
take the unfortunate course of action that it 
followed in 1765 and the succeeding years. 

It is therefore strange to find Bancroft's 
discredited viewpoint taken by a most re- 
spectable historian from across the seas. 
About a dozen years ago Sir George Otto 
Trevelyan began to write a history of the 
American Revolution, of which the sixth and 
last volume has just been published. For no 
very good reason, it seems, the last two vol- 
umes have been called ''George III. and 
Charles James Fox." George III. is no more 
prominent in these than in the earlier ones 
and the same may be said of Charles Fox. It 
' is true, however, that Sir George regards the 
English phase of the conflict as a struggle be- 
tween the opposing political systems that 
these two stood for; and in tracing this con- 
flict the author does not attempt to conceal the 
fact that his sympathies are wholly on the side 
of Fox and the Whigs. Whatever the merits 
'of the American Revolutionary movement, and 
Sir George believes in the essential justice of 
the American cause, the Revolution, and espe- 
cially its outcome, had great importance for 
the history of constitutional government by 
rendering impossible the plans of George III.

Concluding Part of " The American Revolution." By the 
Right Hon. Sir George Otto Trevelyan, Bart. In two vol- 
umes. Volume II. New York : Longmans, Green & Co. 



The cause of English liberty was victorious 
on American battle-fields. 

A work of this type would naturally meet 
with much criticism from both English and 
American reviewers. American reviewers 
have insisted that the work is really a history 
of England during the period of the American 
war ; and that on the American side it shows 
little originality, being chiefly a compilation 
from older American sources. These critics 
feel that the author has not attempted to 
fathom the deeper problems of our history 
during and immediately before the Revolu- 
tion. English reviewers, on the other hand, 
have insisted that, while the American patriots 
may have had the right on their side, they 
were not so virtuous (nor the English states- 
men so villainous) as Sir George would have 
us believe. It has also been charged that his 
statements are not always accurate and that 
his emphasis is often misplaced. There is 
some truth in the charge that the author does 
not always distinguish nicely between impor- 
tant and unimportant matters: in his last 
volume, for instance, he describes in great 
detail two duels, one between Fox and Adam 
and the other between Shelburne and Fullar- 
ton, "affairs "which may have furnished in- 
teresting gossip at the time but seem to have 
had no appreciable influence on the course of 
English history. 

It seems quite evident that the author feels 
that in these fearful days of 1914 there will 
be those who will feel that his work and par- 
ticularly the last volume, containing, as it 
does, much bitter criticism of the administra- 
tion of the Lord North regime, is wanting in 
patriotic spirit. In an inserted "address to 
the reader" (clearly an after- thought) Sir 
George informs us that the volume "was 
already in print some weeks before the out- 
break of the German war" and that there is 
' ' no allusion whatever to passing events. ' ' He 
also assures us that "there is nothing in the 
book which the author desires to correct or 
alter; and the subject-matter is not inappro- 
priate to the soul-stirring period in which we 
are living." Continuing he says, 
" The story of the manly and chivalrous spirit in 
which, four generations ago, the two great English- 
speaking nations fought out, and ended, their 
famous quarrel is a story that an Englishman need 
have no scruple about telling even at a moment 
when his country, with a steadfast and grounded 
belief in the justice of her cause, is in the throes of 
war." 

In this connection one is tempted to quote 
from his characterization of Frederick II. of 
Prussia, some of the sentences of which might 
also be used in giving expression to the aver-

age Englishman 's view of the present German 
Kaiser. The author believes that Americans 
generally have an unwarranted opinion of the 
services that the great Frederick rendered to 
the Revolutionary cause. 

" The gratitude of Americans toward Frederick the 
Great was cheaply earned, and has lasted to this 
very hour. He ran no risks, and made no sacrifices, 
for their cause, and he was apt to forget their very 
existence as soon as they had ceased to serve his 
purpose; and yet room has been found for his 
statue at Washington, while tlie unfortunate King 
of France, who went to war for America with con- 
sequences which ultimately were fatal to his own 
life, and his own dynasty, has no monument erected 
to his memory in any American town or city." 

In his estimates of American generals and 
statesmen Sir George is as a rule very favor- 
able, sometimes using stronger terms than an 
American writer would care to use. In a 
casual reference to General Philip Sheridan 
he speaks of him as "the greatest captain of 
mounted infantry that the world has seen." 
He is much impressed with the strength and 
abilities of the Adams family : 
" For there is perhaps no other instance on record 
of a family which, over the space of a century and 
a half, has produced, in direct descent from father 
to son, four generations of men of such strong and 
sterling character, such remarkable and recognized 
talents, and such vigorous longevity." 

We are reminded of recent events when the 
author tells us that John Adams 
"scrupulously returned the visits made to Passy 
by American gentlemen resident in Paris, who had 
already begun to complain, as American gentlemen 
have complained ever since, that they did not re- 
ceive due attention from the diplomatic representa- 
tives of their country in a foreign capital." 
His estimate of the military abilities of Gen- 
eral Greene is probably somewhat lower than 
that of some American historians: "Nathan- 
iel Greene was not a general of the first order 
but he had mastered the practice and had 
sedulously and clearly thought out the princi- 
ples of war. ' ' 

The volume covers in a general way the last 
two years of the war, beginning with a dis- 
cussion of the state of English opinion after 
it was understood that the European powers 
were preparing to fight England and closing 
with the downfall of the Lord North ministry 
a few months after the surrender of Corn- 
wallis at Yorktown. On the American side 
the work gives fairly satisfactory accounts of 
the activities of the American diplomats 
abroad, of the war in the Carolinas, and of the 
siege of Yorktown. The bulk of the volume, 
however, is devoted to English affairs: the 
Irish volunteer movement, the menace of the 
League of Neutrals, the parliamentary situa- 



tion, the county associations, the Gordon riots, 
and the movement for economical reform are 
some of the larger topics that the author has 
discussed. While Sir George can scarcely find 
terms strong enough to express his condemna- 
tion of the ministry, especially Lord North, 
Lord Sandwich, and Lord George Germaine, 
the last two having charge of the admiralty 
and the war office respectively, he is very chari- 
table in his treatment of the British generals. 
Howe, Clinton, Cornwallis, Carleton, Rawdon, 
were all excellent soldiers; their failure to 
conquer the Continentals the author attributes 
chiefly to the blunders of the English war 
office, from which they received iron-clad and 
impossible instructions. Howe and Clinton 
also lost ground through their failure to ap- 
preciate the value of civil government in the 
conquered or loyal sections ; the military gov- 
ernment that they did provide Sir George 
finds to have been unspeakably corrupt. Of 
General Burgoyne he has this to say : 
" Seldom, except indeed in the legend of Belisarius, 
was a general worse used by his official superiors 
than John Burgoyne. Acting under iron-bound in- 
structions, with a far less than sufficient force of 
troops, he had displayed on several occasions the 
professional skill of a veteran commander, and on 
every occasion the heroic courage of a perfect 
soldier." 

Aside from his estimate of men and meas- 
ures Sir George has contributed little that is 
new or original. Whether his opinions will 
find a very wide acceptance is a matter of 
great doubt. All historians are willing to 
grant that the government of England during 
the first two decades of the reign of George III. 
was most of the time as corrupt and inefficient 
as Sir George asserts it to have been ; but the 
causes of the American Revolution probably 
lay in America rather than in Westminster: 
the forces that work for nationality were at 
work in the western world, and America could 
not be expected to continue much longer as 
the willing subject of a distant government. 
But whether the author's conclusions be ac- 
cepted or rejected, all will admit that he has 
produced a work of singular charm; our 
only regret is that his style and his art have 
enshrined a mistaken view of American his-

down to the present time. Nor are signs alto- 
gether wanting that the appearance of the 
desired book is near at hand. Good models are 
to be had in works of the right proportion on 
other literatures both ancient and modern. 
One thinks of the "Abridged History of Greek 
Literature" by Alfred and Maurice Croiset, 
with its relation to their larger French work 
in five volumes, this latter being perhaps the 
best history of any literature in any language. 
Or one thinks of Mr. J. Wright Duff's most 
admirable "Literary History of Rome," mar- 
vellous for its fulness, accuracy, and conden- 
sation, and for a grace and interest that never 
fail ; or of Lanson 's ' ' History of French Lit- 
erature," which merits a similar description. 
Indeed, we may recall the noble work of Ten 
Brink on English literature itself, regretting 
that no one has seen fit to revise the transla- 
tion, and to complete the whole, in English, in 
the light of our present knowledge in which 
case the demand for an ideal book would be 
satisfied. Wiilker's volume ("Geschichte der 
Englischen Litteratur von den Aeltesten 
Zeiten bis zur Gegenwart"), so far as I am 
aware, is the only work on the subject, by a 
recognized scholar with a technical training, 
that is intended to be popular, and at the same 
time follows the entire course of English 
literature from the beginnings down to Tenny- 
son and Browning. Wiilker was not an in- 
spired literary critic, as Ten Brink was; his 
illustrations, and his estimable motives, 
hardly make up for the lack of attractiveness 
in his pages; nevertheless in scope his book 
supplies a model. 

In addition to models, the trained linguist 
and literary student, who alone could produce 
the desired work, would have a few literary- 
histories of particular epochs to rest upon, 
among them the exceptionally good account of 
Middle English literature by Professor Brandl 
in Paul's ' ' Grundriss " ; and he would have 
at his command the "Cambridge History of 
English Literature" (with its bibliographies), 
though the several parts of this must not be 
employed without discrimination. Nor should 
one forget Professor Northup's forthcoming 
bibliography of bibliographies for the study 
of English, which will be indispensable to 
every scholar in this and related subjects. 
But the ideal historian of English literature 
will not possess every advantage enjoyed by 
Lanson, Duff, and the brothers Croiset: he 
will not find the wheat for his cake so thor- 
oughly ground and bolted as are the materials 
for a literary history of France or Rome or 
Greece. Much scholarly attention, it is true, 
has of late been devoted to the period, or 
periods, subsequent to the accession of Eliza- 



beth, which Ten Brink some twenty years ago 
felt unprepared to treat with precision, and so 
omitted from his plan. Yet from the Eliza- 
bethans on, the historian will find many serious 
gaps in our knowledge, and more than one 
well-nigh incredible defect in the necessary 
apparatus. The prose of Milton, for example, 
has never been properly edited ; and there is 
no satisfactory edition of Burke. Under these 
conditions, the historian must divine the hid- 
den course of events through the force of a 
trained sympathetic insight; an insight into 
the nature and genius of the English language 
and literature as a whole; an insight nour- 
ished in the best traditions of English scholar- 
ship, and rigorously disciplined in those parts 
of the subject for example, in Old English 
where the need of precision is most obvious, if 
not also most attainable. To those who know, 
it is obvious that the first requisite in the way 
of external acquirement for the historian of 
English literature is a thorough knowledge of 
Old and Middle English. 

Mr. Mair's book, in spite of more than one 
excellence, is not of the sort we have in mind. 
It is the outgrowth of his handy little volume, 
' ' English Literature : Modern, ' ' in the ' ' Home 
University Library," which followed a supe- 
rior work in the same series, "English Lit- 
erature: Mediaeval," by Professor Ker. Mr. 
Mair 's present work begins with Chaucer, and 
the author undertakes to defend what is not 
defensible, the old notion that English litera- 
ture begins with "The Canterbury Tales." 
He is at some pains not to be caught saying 
just that, but it is the idea he would like to 
convey. "For the scholars," he remarks, 
"our literature may begin earlier; for the 
poets it began with him [Chaucer]." Is Mr. 
Mair also among the poets? And does he 
think that students of Old English have no 
feeling for literary and historical values? 
Does he forget, too, that, among the poets, Ben 
Jonson, Milton, Wordsworth, and Tennyson 
showed some interest in the earliest stages 
of the language and literature, and were 
variously indebted to the study of it? His 
general mistake, perhaps, lies in uncritically 
following Professor Legouis, and in coming by 
'himself to project Chaucer on a French and 
Italian background ; on this rather than on 
the entire background of mediaeval ideas, En- 
glish as well as Continental, and in Latin as 
well as in the vernacular literatures. But 
in particular one cannot agree with him when 
he says that, if we go no farther back in 
England than Chaucer, "we shall certainly 
lose nothing which affects what is to come 
afterwards." We should miss the Old En- 
glish "Battle of Brunanburh, " which seems to

have affected Tennyson, since he modernized 
it. And when Mr. Mair says that Old English 
is as distinct from Modern as Modern English 
is from German, he must mean superficially 
as it were, to a schoolboy's vision. Neither 
a scholar nor a poet who really knew and loved 
Old English would say so. We suspect Mr. 
Mair's attainments in this part of the field 
from the time he alludes in his Preface to ' ' the 
philologist" (meaning student of linguistics) 
and "the professor of dead dialects"; and we 
therefore suspect his ability to judge after the 
fashion of Ten Brink whether the study of 
Chaucer is much or little dependent upon the 
study of Old and Middle English. 

Before proceeding to the praise which on 
some accounts we wish to accord to Mr. Mair's 
volume, let us attend to a few other strictures. 
His plan, he says, 

" aims at maintaining an individual point of view, 
at laying stress on ideas and tendencies rather than 
at recording facts and events, and it does not hesi- 
tate to draw generously on standard works of criti- 
cism and biography with which students are 
familiar." 

If in several cases the author derives his 
opinions from excellent studies, such as the 
work on Chaucer by Professor Legouis, never- 
theless he cannot be termed discriminating in 
the matter of authorities. Thue he is capable 
of naming as the "two best critics" of Milton 
one who is good, but not best, Mark Pattison, 
and "Professor" Walter Raleigh, who is 
negligible. Where in his hierarchy would Mr. 
Mair put Addison and Dr. Robert Bridges? 
And where would Osgood, Masson, and Verity 
come in? This lack of discrimination as to 
books is on a par with several other uncritical 
utterances. For example, Milton "never vio- 
lates the harmony of sound or sense." Is that 
an echo of Matthew Arnold's description, "In 
the sure and flawless perfection of his rhythm 
and diction ...... ."1 It was Huxley, was it 

not, who imagined that Herbert Spencer's 
definition of tragedy would be, "a generaliza- 
tion killed by a fact"? Enter Mr. Mair's un- 
guarded "never" followed by this irrecon- 
cilable fact from the Ninth Book of "Paradise 
Lost" (11.41. ff.): 

" Mee of these 

Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument 
Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise 
That name, unless an age too late, or cold 
Climat, or Years damp my intended wing 
Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine." 
Yes, the good Milton sometimes nods, as his 
best critic, Wordsworth, frankly admits, 
stating the matter thus : 

" I could point out to you five hundred passages in 
Milton upon which labor has been bestowed, and 
twice five hundred more to which additional labor 



would have been serviceable; not that I regret the 
absence of such labor, because no poem contains 
more proof of skill acquired by practice." 
Nor would better critics, I believe, go so far as 
to say with Mr. Mair that Milton ' ' devised his 
own subjects, and wrote his own style," or 
that "he stands alone, and must be judged 
alone"; Mark Pattison, indeed, says some- 
thing different. Granting that Milton's soul 
was like a star, and dwelt apart, we cannot 
judge the poet by himself, since there is no 
astronomy, or other science, of the individual. 
His subjects were the common property of 
England, Holland, and Italy, and his treat- 
ment of them was profoundly influenced by 
the Italian interpretation of ancient poetical 
theory. 

To tell the truth, Mr. Mair, as his over- 
praise evinces, is not in sympathy with Milton, 
but with traditional notions about the poet, 
unrectified by scholarly observation and com- 
parison of the facts. As a result, coming to 
the point in Milton 's biography where sympa- 
thy is most needed, he rashly declares that 
"Milton always argued from himself to man- 
kind at large," and falls into the vulgar error 
of associating the Miltonic writings on divorce 
too closely with Milton's private life. Are 
they not, rather, singularly objective, and is 
there anything better on the subject in En- 
glish? The spirit of them is altogether in 
keeping w r ith the ideal of good manners rep- 
resented in the speeches of Adam and Eve, 
almost constantly, in "Paradise Lost," and 
constantly in the words and actions of the 
Hero in "Paradise Regained." "Manners," 
we recall, are one of the gifts which Words- 
worth, good poet and scholar, thinks to be in 
Milton 's keeping for England. 

Turning to Shakespeare, we again find Mr. 
Mair using that dangerous word "never": 
"A study of the plots of either the comedies or the 
tragedies will convince the reader that the orderly 
faculty of marshalling events has never been so 
completely shown in the work of any other writer." 

What about Sophocles? But perhaps we are 
to understand: any other English writer. 
Well, what about Thackeray in "The Rose and 
the Ring," or Fielding in "Tom Jones"? 
"What a master of composition Fielding 
was!" says Coleridge. "Upon my word, I 
think the 'Oedipus Tyrannus,' 'The Alchem- 
ist,' and 'Tom Jones' the three most perfect 
plots ever planned." No Shakespearean 
scholar would have expressed himself as does 
Mr. Mair; in the first place, none would put 
most of the comedies, in the matter of con- 
struction, on as high a level as most of the 
tragedies. And to sum up in the words of 
Mr. A. C. Bradley on Shakespeare : 



18 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1 



" Nine-tenths of his defects are not . . . the errors 
of an inspired genius, ignorant of art, but the sins 
of a great but negligent artist." 

Turning to the pages on Wordsworth, we 
discover the same bent for overstatement, 
and for essentially the same sort of thread- 
bare comment as is passed along in certain 
handbooks of criticism and biography with 
which students are familiar. Thus: Words- 
worth is "a complete innovator"; "he found 
his subjects in new places"; in his earlier 
years he had a vision of "nature," which 
eventually faded, so that only "a few fine 
things fitfully illumine the enormous and 
dreary bulk of his later work " ; " if we lost all 
but the 'Lyrical Ballads,' the poems of 1804 
[misprint for 1807], and the 'Prelude,' and 
the 'Excursion,' Wordsworth's position as a 
poet would be no lower than it is now. ' ' Does 
Mr. Mair realize that he has included three- 
quarters of the poet 's work ? The bulk of what 
is left is not enormous. The other assertions 
also need reconsideration. Wordsworth is not 
a complete innovator : in part he harks back to 
his favorite "elder poets" more especially 
to Spenser and Milton. Substituting England 
for Sicily and the Mediterranean, one may say 
that Wordsworth finds his subjects where The- 
ocritus found them; and that is just what he 
tells us in the Eighth Book of the "Prelude." 
In his earlier period his imagination was 
tinged with a neo-Platonism which, while not 
very good of its kind, still counts as "poetry" 
with the average reader of the present. That 
is, when Wordsworth talks about a motion and 
a spirit "rolling" through various things, peo- 
ple think him inspired, though they may not 
care for his translation of Michael Angelo's 
address "To the Supreme Being," which 
contains a very different form of teaching. 
Wordsworth gradually outgrew his crude 
naive philosophy, and, drawing his inspira- 
tion less and less from neo-Platonism, and 
more and more from Christianity, produced a 
body of verse that in workmanship is superior 
to his earlier attempts. Much of it is likely to 
attract well-educated readers of subsequent 
generations, when the doctrine of divine imma- 
nence gives way, as it gave way in Words- 
worth, to a more artistic conception of the 
universe. There are not "a few," but many 
"fine things" in the "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," 
that most important of his later writings ; it 
is a body of work that naturally falls into its 
place with the writings of Herbert and Keble ; 
and a critic who aims at maintaining an indi- 
vidual point of view (which means observing 
and comparing for himself) cannot afford to 
treat it as it is treated in ordinary books of 
criticism and biography. 



Though he now and then lapses into an 
overfamiliar style, and though, as we have 
seen, his judgments lack finality, Mr. Mair on 
the whole is naturally alert, and expresses 
things for himself, often with vigor, and 
sometimes with felicity. He duly insists upon 
looking at the history of literature in the light 
of fundamental principles, and on occasion 
enunciates such doctrine as the following 
(pp. 47-48) : 

" The unit of all ordinary kinds of writing is the 
word, and one is not commonly quarrelled with for 
using words that have belonged to other people. 
But the unit of the lyric, like the unit of spoken 
conversation, is not the word but the phrase. Now 
in daily human intercourse the use, which is uni- 
versal and habitual, of set forms and phrases of 
talk is not commonly supposed to detract from or 
destroy sincerity. In the crises, indeed, of emotion 
it must be most people's experience that the natural 
speech that rises unbidden and easiest to the lips is 
something quite familiar and commonplace, some 
form which the accumulated experience of many 
generations of separate people has found best for 
such circumstances or such an occasion. The lyric 
is in the position of conversation at such a height- 
ened and emotional moment . . . This is not to say 
that there is no such thing as originality ; a poet is 
a poet first and most of all because he discovers 
truths that have been known for ages, as things that 
are fresh and new and vital for himself." 



A word of praise must be given to the six- 
teen portraits scattered through the volume. 
The one of Wordsworth (p. 220), reproducing 
the sketch by Pickersgill in the Library of St. 
John's College, Cambridge, though not well 
known, is a fortunate choice.

AN ICONOCLAST IN ARCHITECTURAL, 
CRITICISM.* 



Mr. Geoffrey Scott's "The Architecture of 
Humanism: A Study in the History of 
Taste" breaks sharply with the traditions 
of English criticism by attacking the formulas 
on which the apotheoses of Greek and of 
Gothic art have been based and boldly cham- 
pioning the architecture of the Renaissance. 
In the mind of the author the book is an at- 
tempt to formulate the chief aesthetic princi- 
ples of classical design in architecture, and to 
trace the history of our critical canons; in 
reality it is a violent polemic against earlier 
opinions and a dogmatic apologia for a style 
deified in advance. 

In so far as the author makes clear the 
development and points out the inadequacies 
of nineteenth century critical theory he does

a needful service. The working belief of the 
contemporary artist and critic of art is too 
often a jumble of incongruous fragments from 
earlier systems, patched together without ap- 
preciation of their inconsistency or true his- 
torical relations. The text in hand brings 
order into this confusion, distinguishing, very 
justly, successive phases in the development 
of critical dogmas. On the academic method 
of imitation of the antique and search for per- 
fect mathematical proportions, followed the 
romantic idealization first of Greece and then 
of the Middle Ages, passing over into the cult 
of the natural and the picturesque. Then fol- 
lowed the ethical evaluation of styles by 
Ruskin and his followers, the mechanical or 
structural evaluation of Violet-le-Duc, and 
finally the biological, evolutionary explana- 
tion of compulsion from environment which 
still dominates criticism. Obviously any of 
these interpretations singly, or all of them 
together, cannot exhaust the aesthetic values 
of architecture. There will still remain purely 
spacial relationships, eluding even the aca- 
demic formula?. To call all previous views 
"fallacies" out of hand, however, as does Mr. 
Scott, betrays a failure to realize their par- 
tial validity, as well as a lack of historic 
modesty. 

The substitute which he has to offer, the 
"humanist" evaluation, is not, we find, the 
theory of the humanists themselves, but a 
modern psychological doctrine, humanist only 
in a curious sense Professor Lipps's theory 
of Einfuhlung. This familiar hypothesis, 
which Mr. Bernhard Berenson has already ap- 
plied to Renaissance painting, explains our 
aesthetic sensations as unconscious projections 
into the external world of our own bodily 
movements and tensions. To illustrate, arches 
seem to "spring," domes to "swell," and 
spires to ' ' soar, ' ' because we identify ourselves 
with their apparent states. If one were dis- 
posed to jest, one might say that Mr. Scott's 
own fallacy had been added in advance, by his 
own arch-villain, Ruskin, to the romantic, the 
ethical, the mechanical, and the biologic falla- 
cies which he himself has condemned. It is 
the pathetic fallacy, a poetic animism, digni- 
fied by a modern and philosophic garb. "With- 
out entering seriously upon its merits, we may 
suggest that its truth or falsity is really irrele- 
vant to Mr. Scott's more concrete propositions 
that mass, space, line, and coherence are the 
true language of architecture, and that Renais- 
sance architecture, which speaks this language 
with least restraint, is the style in which archi- 
tectural principles can most fruitfully be 
studied. 

The importance of abstract qualities like 



mass, line, and space is recognized by aesthetic 
philosophers whose systems are most diverse 
or antagonistic. Even one who has given such 
a wide extension to the aesthetic field as Signor 
Benedetto Croce sees in them the channels for 
those expressions peculiar to architecture, in- 
capable of translation into other media. The 
idea that they exhaust its values, however, is 
an intolerable limitation, and one which, un- 
just to other styles, does Renaissance archi- 
tecture itself less than justice. We must turn 
against the author's dogmatic assertions, his 
own protest against earlier apologies : ' ' Con- 
ducted without impartiality, arguments such 
as these are but the romance of criticism; 
they can intensify and decorate our preju- 
dices, but cannot render them convincing." 
It is true that a sympathetic estimate of 
Renaissance architecture must depend on an 
appreciation of abstract, spacial qualities, but 
it is equally true that an extension of the 
abstract criterion to other styles as the one 
principle of judgment would be as illegiti- 
mate as similar extensions of mechanical or 
biological criteria. 

Perhaps Mr. Scott's brilliant and forceful 
rhetoric, in spite of the over- emphasis which 
arouses protest at almost every page, is the 
only weapon by which popular prejudices, 
themselves partly rhetorical in origin, can be 
beaten down. It is a pity, though, if the 
rhetorical bias of English criticism is so strong 
as to deprive us permanently of discussion 
which is measured and temperate.

RECENT VIEWS or CHINA.* 



The conflagration now consuming the visi- 
ble fabric of civilization in Europe, from 
which brands have already been carried by 
Japan to the northeast corner of China, gives 
increased importance to all questions concern- 
ing the future of the Chinese people. Consti- 
tuting so large a fraction of the population of 
the globe, and inhabiting territory immensely 
wealthy in undeveloped resources, this people 
seems to be destined to play either a great or 
a very pitiable role in the history of the pres- 
ent century. The decision of Fate between 
these two possibilities rests upon external and 
internal forces still difficult to gauge. If the 
present stupendous conflict in Europe deter- 
mines whether the leading nationalities of the 
world are to be military and conquering in

temper, or commercial and increasingly fra- 
ternal, it will turn the scales one way or the 
other for China. But the internal forces to 
be estimated are complex, subtle, and in 
transition, so that they are now scarcely capa- 
ble of certain analysis and are treacherous 
material for prophecy. With all that has been 
written about China and the Chinese, the 
Occident is by no means of one mind concern- 
ing the traits of the race and its capabilities. 
There is need just now for much thorough- 
going study of the Chinese. 

Three recent books add each something of 
worth to the material upon which we must 
base our forecast of China 's future world rela- 
tionships. The three authors, fortunately, see 
their subject from three distinct points of 
view. Mr. Gibson is a "military interpreter 
in the Chinese language"; Dr. Christie is a 
medical missionary who has spent thirty years 
in Mukden, Manchuria ; Mrs. Gaunt is a pro- 
fessional writer of fiction and stories of travel. 

"Forces Mining and Undermining China" 
is, we regret to say, lacking in that orderly 
analysis and mastery of material which wins 
the confidence of the reader in the judgment 
of the writer. The book contains valuable 
information concerning mining, railways, 
labor, finances, and concessions in China, and 
is well worth a rapid survey; but it lacks 
maturity of judgment and dignity of expres- 
sion. 

"Thirty Years in the Manchu Capital" is, 
on the other hand, a work of unusual merit. 
A simple, unpretentious account of events that 
have come under the author's personal ob- 
servation and experiences through which he 
has passed, the book throws much light upon 
two wars fought on Chinese territory the 
Chino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese conflicts 
and gives the reader definite impressions of 
Chinese character through sketches of various 
individual Chinese known to the author. The 
method and style of the book are natural and 
entertaining. The author wins without effort 
the confidence and respect of the reader, and 
his kindly and favorable estimate of the Chi- 
nese carries a high degree of conviction. There 
is, however, very little effort at generalizing, 
so that the book furnishes evidence rather 
than argument in connection with the problem 
of China. 

Among recent publications dealing with 
this problem no book we have seen possesses 
the literary merit of Mrs. Gaunt 's "A Woman 
in China. ' ' Entering the country by the Sibe- 
rian Railway in mid-winter shortly after the 
Revolution, the author spent some weeks in 
Peking observing and studying, and then trav- 
elled without companion by cart to Jehol, 



Inner Mongolia, the ancient hunting palace 
and grounds of the Manchu emperors. Her 
opportunity for forming an independent im- 
pression of the Chinese was, thus, very differ- 
ent from that of the ordinary tourist, and her 
training as a writer has enabled her to pro- 
duce one of the most entertaining and pleas- 
ing of books on the subject. Artistic by tem- 
perament, Mrs. Gaunt has filled her pages 
with sketches from life, vivid and delightful. 
Her appreciation of Chinese architecture and 
landscape gardening is more earnest and out- 
spoken than that of any writer we recall. In- 
deed, "A Woman in China" is a rather 
unusual blend of keen observation, humor, 
sympathy, and artistic sense. 

An artist, however, is a delineator and in- 
terpreter of the static present, not a guide or 
a prophet. Possessed completely by the sem- 
blance before the eyes and concerned in its 
reproduction through the medium of art, the 
artist lacks a sense for the future, as yet invisi- 
ble and wholly unpicturesque. In spite of her 
evident good judgment, Mrs. Gaunt is, first of 
all, an artist. The China which seemed to her 
antique and static, ancient Babylon still sur- 
viving in the midst of a novel and alien world, 
does not thus appear to Dr. Christie, who has 
witnessed the changes of only three decades. 
Even the most gifted observer may be so 
engrossed by the quaint and outre in features, 
costume, manners, and age-long habits that he 
requires years, rather than weeks, to penetrate 
behind these veils which conceal the essential 
human spirit. Diversity in outward mani- 
festations does not disprove the unity of the 
human soul in all the races of men. The civ- 
ilization of any race may be slowly trans- 
formed by the working of new forces brought 
to bear upon it, and such forces are now at 
work in China.

tanus, ' ' a selection in striking contrast to that 
made a year or two ago by a retired English 
army officer, who gave us three of the least 
significant and characteristic of the comedies 
in a singularly w r ooden translation. Dr. 
Campbell's three represent Holberg at his 
best, and his version is nervous, colloquial, 
and faithful. The Tegner volume, edited by 
Mr. Paul Robert Lieder, offers a reprint of 
old matter Longfellow's "The Children of 
the Lord's Supper" and W. L. Blackley's 
^'Frithiof's Saga" the latter first printed 
in 1857. This is a fair translation no bet- 
ter than several others of the score or more 
that exist, but it has the distinction of having 
been the first to be printed in this country. 
Commander William Hovgaard's treatise on 
"The Voyages of the Norsemen to America" 
is planned on a large scale, and makes a vol- 
ume of three hundred pages, abundantly illus- 
trated. So much work has been done in this 
field of recent years that a comprehensive 
statement of the theories and conclusions of 
modern scholars is a very desirable thing to 
have, and the author is well equipped for the 
performance. He treats of his subject as an 
historical critic, a naturalist, an archaeologist 
and ethnologist, and especially as an expert 
in nautical matters and geography. The 
treatment of all these matters is minute and 
exhaustive. With regard to controverted 
points, it may be said that he regards the 
saga narratives as essentially historical, in 
opposition to Nansen's belief in their legen- 
dary character; that he believes the Skrael- 
ings in some instances to have been Indians 
and not Eskimos; that he holds the vinber 
to have been grapes rather than currants or 
cranberries, and Vinland (with the long 
vowel) to have really meant Wineland; and 
he offers evidence that the site of Leif 's set- 
tlement may well have been as far south as 
the coast of Massachusetts. Perhaps the most 
valuable part of the work is its detailed de- 
scription of the Atlantic coast from Baffin 
Land to the Hudson, and its attempts to 
identify the shores described in the sagas 



with actual parts of the American continent. 
The whole question is bewildering and baf- 
fling, and Commander Hovgaard has probably 
done all that is scientifically possible to shed 
light upon it. He has no hobbies, and this is 
perhaps the most important prerequisite for 
the handling of the whole complex problem. 

Mr. Ernest Newman in his book 
it tl Wagner as Man and Artist" 
(Dutton) gives us a full length 
painting of the remarkable musician and 
dramatist. He says in his Preface: "In 
spite of the size of this volume, many readers 
will no doubt feel that it either discusses 
inadequately several aspects of Wagner's 
work and personality or it passes them over 
altogether. I plead guilty; but to have fol- 
lowed Wagner up in every one of his many- 
sided activities in all his political, ethical, 
economic, ethnical, sociological speculations 
would have necessitated not one book but 
four." And yet he says farther on : "While 
there is at present no adequate life of Wag- 
ner, there is probably more biographical mate- 
rial available in connection with him than 
with any other artist who has lived; and on 
the basis of this material it seems justifiable 
now to attempt what was impossible until 
the publication of Mein Leben in 1911 a 
complete and psychological estimate of him." 
We do not feel that the two statements can 
be made to agree, and we find, indeed, that in 
the long discussion of "Wagner as a Man/' 
there are principally presented the relations 
of Wagner with his wife, Minna, and the 
other women who contrived to make his life 
disappointing and miserable until Cosima 
Wagner made her appearance. A treatment 
of Wagner's relations to politics, government, 
economics, might have been undertaken with- 
out detriment to a subject like friendships 
with the other sex, which ought in every case 
to be kept within the limits which belong to 
it. Mr. Newman could have compressed the 
love episodes, and enlarged the consideration 
of other sides of Wagner's character without 
becoming prolix or lessening the value of his 
picture. He could have led up to his superb 
summary by a completer exposition of the 
varied interests of this restless and cosmopoli- 
tan artist. We also question the advisability 
of considering the form, to the exclusion of 
the content, of Wagner's works. We see this 
course taken and advocated in the second 
part of the book, "The Artist in Theory." 
It would seem that a discussion of Wag- 
ner's power of character representation, his 
mastery of material, his immense advances 
in technique, would be enhanced by adequate 



22

statements of his intent and purpose. Such 
was undoubtedly the opinion of the com- 
poser, and the reproduction of his idea in 
completely congruous music was his great 
effort and purpose. It is unquestionably in 
the third part of his volume, "The Artist in 
Practice," that Mr. Newman finds himself 
most at home, and it is here that the reader 
will find him most convincing and authorita- 
tive. Whatever our views may be of Wagner 
and his work, we must take into account this 
book of Mr. Newman's. All the great ques- 
tions in regard to Wagner's achievement are 
here considered with insight. We may not 
agree with Mr. Newman's conclusions, but we 
must concede his knowledge, his depth of 
appreciation, his eloquence of expression. No 
book on the subject will appeal to a larger 
circle of readers, nor give a more vivid con- 
ception of the whole movement. 



Insect biog- 

raphies, new 



The charm of M. J. H. Fabre's 

. , . , 

Souvenicr Entomologiques, 
published in 1882 and now 
translated by Mr. Alexander Teixeira De 
Mattos, has its origin in the author's enthusi- 
asm for his researches, in his skill in building 
up the reader's interest in his observations 
and experiments, and in a certain naive un- 
sophisticated simplicity. The translator has 
preserved the latter admirably in "The 
Mason-bees" (Dodd, Mead & Co.) the latest 
volume in the series of translations of M. 
Fabre 's work. This deals with the habits and 
instincts of certain solitary mud-working 
bees of southern Europe and touches upon the 
operation and origin of such fundamental bio- 
logical phenomena as the homing instinct in 
bees, ants, and cats, and the origin of the semi- 
parasitic habits of those bees which, like the 
cuckoos among birds, lay their eggs in nests 
not their own. The author is a keen observer, 
with an experimental turn of mind, and puts 
to test his theories of sight and memory as 
guiding factors in the homeward movements 
of insects. The translation is excellently done 
save for a few lapses into archaic terms. 
While M. Fabre depends wholly upon word 
pictures to charm his reader, Ward's "Insect 
Biographies with Pen and Camera" (Stokes) 
supplements these by plates in color and 
heliotype and excellent half-tones. The book 
aims to present the life histories of certain of 
the representative insects, such as the lace- 
wing fly, various moths and butterflies, the 
"death watch" beetles, the hover-fly, and the 
flea, and adds to these some account of mites 
and spiders. The photographs are nearly all 
from life, and the attitudes of the subjects por- 
trayed are therefore normal. Both the pho- 



tographer and the engraver have succeeded 
exceptionally well in their work. Intensive 
study directed to a few carefully selected 
types and carried to a high degree of com- 
pleteness characterizes this work and lifts it 
above the level of the ordinary "nature 
study" treatment of entomological topics. 



It is always an unwelcome task 
An ambitious ^o question the value of an ex- 

OOOK on Ctcero. 5 _ . 

tended work written by a con- 
scientious scholar of mature years; but a 
dutiful reviewer is bound to ask what useful 
end can be served by Professor E. G. Sihler's 
large volume on "Cicero of Arpinum" (Yale 
University Press). The gifted Tully, so 
unanimously lauded as an orator, so bitterly 
debated as a statesman, has been the subject 
of many pens, and a new treatise on a large 
scale can be justified only by unique historical 
acumen or some singular felicity of presenta- 
tion. To the latter qualification our volume 
can make no claim whatever ; in fact, a rigor- 
ous effort is necessary to hold oneself to the 
task of reading it, so dispiriting is the style 
even to the most loyal student, so painful to 
any reader with the least literary feeling. If 
the editors of a great university press, like 
that of Yale, cannot ensure a passably good 
general presentation, they might at least pre- 
clude annoying violations of elementary gram- 
mar and punctuation. Naturally, however, 
almost any failure in English would be gladly 
forgiven if the work were distinguished by an 
unusually keen sense for human character 
and motives, by some fine gift of perspective, 
some compelling profundity of judgment, 
some comprehensive faculty of grouping the 
particular and universal together, in short, 
by some exceptional power of dealing with 
history in biography. But, unfortunately, 
one misses these high essentials, and finds in- 
stead average ability, unsparing toil, and 
meticulous scholarship. However, we are glad 
to accord most unstinted praise to one noble 
quality, an absolute honesty of purpose 
that shines from every page. There is a care- 
fully arranged bibliography, followed by an 
index. 

That quality of lyric poetry 
observations of which lies in the unquestioning 

a flat-dweller. . ,*.., j 

assumption that the reader is as 
much interested in the poet's private affairs 
as the poet himself, reveals itself quite en- 
gagingly on every page of Mr. Simeon 
Strunsky's "Belshazzar Court" (Holt), the 
supposed account of the family affairs and 
certain other intimate concerns of a young 
married couple and their two children in their

life on the third floor of a mammoth apart- 
ment house in the far up-town regions of 
New York. As in Mr. Edward S. Martin's 
"Reflections of a Beginning Husband," which 
the book strongly resembles in some of its 
features, it is the young head of the family 
who acts as scribe, and who realistically pic- 
tures the pleasures and a few of the vexations 
of domestic life in a household just a little less 
prosperous, pecuniarily, than its tastes, its 
refinement, its ideals, might have rendered 
desirable. The entrance hall of Belshazzar 
Court has handsome electroliers in imitation 
cut glass, a magnificent marble fireplace in 
which the effect of a wood fire is simulated by 
electric bulbs under a sheet of red isinglass, 
while the heat is furnished by a steam radiator 
close by, and the floor has two large Oriental 
rugs of American manufacture. What the 
humorously communicative young father has 
to say about his irrepressible son Harold and 
the latter 's baby sister, about his wife Emme- 
line, and, not least of all, about himself, his 
interests and diversions, his views of things 
metropolitan and cosmopolitan and miscella- 
neous, will be found entertainingly set forth 
in the eight discursive chapters of the book, 
which, it will be discovered by magazine read- 
ers, is not an entirely new production, though 
none the worse for that fact. Mr. Strunsky has 
in the last few years made a name for him- 
self as a humorist of decidedly original qual- 
ity, and "Belshazzar Court" sustains this 
reputation. 

Mr. M. L. Spencer's "Practical 
En g lish Punctuation" contains 
much more matter than its title 
implies; it is really a compendium of direc- 
tions for the preparation of almost any kind 
of manuscript. It has no discussion of the 
principles of punctuation, and presents noth- 
ing new in organization or arrangement; for 
the sake of brevity the directions are usually 
given as dogmatic rules. The basis of these 
rules is the practice of the more conservative 
magazines and the more careful writers of the 
present day, and wherever usage varies, what 
appears to be the preferred practice is indi- 
cated. Of course the first edition of such a 
compendium provokes some adverse criticism. 
The specimen sheet of corrected proof with 
the accompanying explanation is not so ser- 
viceable as it should have been made, some of 
the statements are very awkwardly phrased 
or are capable of misinterpretation, and occa- 
sionally the rules are too broadly stated. But 
such defects are not numerous. The rules are 
generally sound and clearly illustrated, the 
material is made readily accessible through a 



fine index, the presswork is very satisfactory, 
and typographical errors are notably absent. 
The volume should largely realize the hope 
expressed in the Preface that it "may be 
found to be a compact, convenient, and rea- 
sonably full compendium of rules for the 
guidance of all persons who have need to 
write. ' ' ( Menasha, Wisconsin : The Collegiate 
Press. ) 

Mr. Walter A. Mursell knew 
TZSSBSE himself at the age of ten to be 

a book-lover, and at twelve be- 
gan to be a book-buyer, taking delight in 
browsing about old bookshops. To him "they 
are what form and outline and color are to the 
artist, what beauty is to the poet, what 
springtime is to the lover, what summer 
meadows are to the child. ' ' That such a person 
should write well about books is no cause for 
surprise. "Byways in Bookland" (Hough- 
ton) consists of a series of "confessions and 
digressions," informal and intimate and alto- 
gether delightful. In a chatty, autobiograph- 
ical fashion Mr. Mursell tells us of the birth 
of a book-lover, his first footsteps in bookland, 
the comradeship of books, the green pastures 
and still waters of bookland, its valley of twi- 
light, the spurs of Parnassus, a brown study, 
a recent byway, and, finally, emerging from 
byways, he pays tribute to two great writers 
who hold first place in his heart, Dickens 
and Stevenson. After a page of almost ex- 
travagant eulogy of Mr. Ambrose Bierce, and 
more especially of his book, "In the Midst of 
Life," he shows his imperfect acquaintance 
with that author by saying, ' ' I believe this is 
his solitary book : at any rate, on this side the 
Atlantic." One might object to his spelling 
in the chapter where he glows with enthusi- 
asm for "The Arabian Nights" and writes of 
"Sinbad" and " Scheherezade. " Mr. Mur- 
sell's "confessions and digressions" are all 
excellent, largely because they are sincere and 
unpretentious, and are written, not to make 
a book, but because the mere writing is a 
pleasure. 



A thoughtful 
discussion of 
poverty. 



"Now, in our own day, the 
conquest of poverty looms up as 
an economic possibility, defi- 
nitely within reach if only society desire it 
sufficiently and will pay enough to achieve 
it." Such are the heartening words that 
close the tiny volume, ' ' The Abolition of Pov- 
erty" (Hough ton), wherein Professor Hollan- 
der of Johns Hopkins University treats the 
problem that he regards as the heart and 
centre of social disturbance. He believes that 
poverty is needless, and this hopeful tenet 



24 



THE DIAL 



[Jan. 1 



brightens a sane and succinct discussion of 
such topics as ' ' The Distribution of Income, ' ' 
"The Rate of Wages," "The Underpaid," 
and "The Unemployable." On the whole 
our economist is "unwilling save as a last 
resort to venture upon the uncharted sea of 
socialism," and seeks a solution of the prob- 
lem in constructive social regulation. Here- 
with he proposes to "retain the competitive 
system of industry, both as to production and 
distribution, but to impose thereon, by re- 
straint of law and by pressure of public opin- 
ion, such limitation and control as experience 
demonstrates to be necessary for the largest 
social interest." However, the academic 
socialist, at least, need worry but little over 
this formal repudiation; for our author 
really believes in drastic measures, and with 
reasoned warmth expresses approval of not a 
few specific remedies that would have been 
decried as the rankest of socialism only a 
decade or two ago. If you get old-age pen- 
sions, a minimum wage, insurance against 
unemployment, and half a score other amen- 
datory measures, and if these operate success- 
fully along with state postal systems, state 
telegraphs and telephones, state canals, state 
education, and what not, it will rapidly become 
less difficult to look upon the ever chang- 
ing proposals of socialistic thinkers with fear- 
less eyes. In any event, such books as the 
modest study before us deserve the warmest 
welcome. In fact, we are even prepared to 
hope that some day "The Abolition of Pov- 
erty" will be available at about a third of the 
present price, although this is by no means 
unreasonable. 



A brief survey "Elizabethan Literature" by 
of the Mr. J. M. Robertson has just 

been added to the "Home Uni- 
versity Library, ' ' published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. It presents logically and as com- 
prehensively as the two hundred and fifty 
pages will permit the multiform activities of 
the age. Mr. Robertson has a first-hand ac- 
quaintance with Elizabethan writers. Apart 
from Middleton, whom he barely mentions 
among the later dramatists, he slights none of 
them; and he gives much space, too much 
perhaps, to the smaller fry. In a work of 
this kind, do Phaer, Twine, Fleming, and 
Stanyhurst, those wretched translators of 
Virgil, deserve attention? Will not Surrey 
suffice for the man whose university is at 
home? In matters of opinion Mr. Robertson 
is nearly always safe and usually forceful. 
He argues vigorously, for example, that "the 
vital divergence" between English and 
French drama is not "an expression of the 



divergent minds or temperaments of the two 
nations"; but that "the very freedom of 
action in the French popular drama, trans- 
gressing all bounds of decency, . . . made 
possible the reaction to strict classicism." 
Sometimes Mr. Robertson is incautious in 
statement, however, as when he says that 
Marlowe ' ' was more than audacious in his 
free thinking," and that Lyly "showed the 
way" in delicate lyrics. And when in his 
bibliographical note he refers to the "careful 
texts" of the Globe and Craig editions, but 
ignores the Neilson edition, we wonder 
whether he is really unaware of so notable an 
achievement of American scholarship. 



Under the title "The Life of a 
?nd a iitar demic L i ttle College" (Houghton), 

Professor Archibald MacMechan 
has collected a number of papers dealing 
with such themes as, "Little College Girls," 
"The Vanity of Travel," "Tennyson as 
Artist," "Child of the Ballads," "Every- 
body's Alice," and "Virgil." All of the 
essays are pleasing for their reflection of a 
well stocked mind and amiable personality, 
as well as for their well ordered English, 
which a college instructor would characterize 
as having an agreeable literary flavor with no 
disturbing smack of pedantry. Probably the 
most valuable chapter bears the caption 
"Evangeline and the Real Acadians"; al- 
though old Toronto men will enjoy the pic- 
ture of the unique bedel, McKim, and the 
full-hearted eulogy of Professor Young in 
"This is Our Master." To one who remem- 
bers the less mature views of Professor 
MacMechan on the worthlessness of classical 
studies, it is joyous to read his graceful 
palinode in the closing pages. Most of the 
papers have appeared before, and we have 
enjoyed many of them as they are now pre- 
sented ; but it would be too much to say that 
there is enough matter of exceptional value or 
profundity in the individual essays to com- 
pensate for their lack of unity and make them 
widely acceptable to the reading public in 
their collected form. 



A new collection of essays by

is always welcome. The latest 
one, "Essays on Books" (Macmillan), though 
perhaps less solid than some of its predeces- 
sors, makes quite as pleasant reading. The 
opening chapter, "Realism and Reality in 
Fiction," enforces with apt concrete illustra- 
tion a distinction that ought to be, but is not, 
a literary platitude ; realism represents a frac- 
tion of life, reality represents life as a whole.

All of the dozen essays that follow have to do 
with single writers, six English writers, two 
American, four German. The most preten- 
tious are those on Richardson and Jane Aus- 
ten; the slightest are those on Whittier and 
Paul Heyse. Almost all of the essays may be 
termed insubstantial but highly agreeable. 
One of the most agreeable is that entitled 
"Conversations with Paul Heyse," in which 
Heyse is recorded as saying that he "read 
with the most conscientious attention every 
word of ' Huckleberry Finn. ' I never laughed 
once. I found absolutely not a funny thing 
in the book." 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The second volume of the new edition of George 
Chapman's plays and poems, published by Messrs. 
Button in the "Library of Scholarship and Let- 
ters" series, contains eleven comedies, of which 
three are not included in the edition of 1873 and 
one, " Sir Gyles Goosecap," originally published 
anonymously, has never before appeared under 
Chapman's name. The editor, Dr. Thomas Marc 
Parrott, has edited the text with great care, and 
furnishes elaborate notes and cross-references, the 
latter being particularly valuable in determining 
disputed or anonymous authorship of the comedies 
in question. 

Mr. John Cowper Powys has written " The War 
and Culture : A Reply to Professor Miinsterberg," 
(Valhalla, N. Y. : G. Arnold Shaw) for the purpose 
of pointing out the essential differences in the ideas 
behind the great war, rightly considering these 
fundamental in any consideration of the struggle. 
Germany embodies itself in the conception of a 
state machine, the Allies in that of human liberty 
and the freedom of little states. Behind the 
English-speaking nations stands also the idea of 
law, not to be lightly cast aside lest all civilization 
be imperilled. One extended chapter, which deals 
with " German vs. Russian Culture," is especially 
enlightening. 

Unrevised for twenty-three years and passing 
through nine editions, Bartlett's " Familiar Quo- 
tations: A Collection of Passages, Phrases, and 
Proverbs Traced to Their Sources in Ancient and 
Modern Literature " has become accepted as the 
standard reference book of its kind. Now, nine 
years after the compiler's death, a tenth edition, 
revised and enlarged by Mr. Nathan Haskell Dole, 
has been issued from the press of Messrs. Little, 
Brown & Co. About three hundred additional 
pages are included; selections from Matthew 
Arnold, Keats, and many others are judiciously 
amplified by twice the original space; names like 
Ibsen, Tolstoi, Nietzsche, Maeterlinck, Rostand, or 
George Meredith (names that, naturally enough, 
are unfamiliar in the original edition) here appear. 
A revision, bringing the work to date, was essen- 
tial, and Mr. Dole's faithful effort to preserve the 
spirit of the original will ensure for his compila- 
tion a warm welcome from those who are familiar 
with the work of Bartlett.

Madison Cawein, who died December 14, 1914 r 
at the age of forty-nine, was a poet richly endowed 
with the gift of interpreting nature in verse. The 
aspects of nature presented in his verse were 
those of his native State of Kentucky, where he 
lived all his life. Exuberantly productive from 
his early manhood to the time of his premature 
death, Cawein published more than a score of 
books of verses. Eight years ago a complete edi- 
tion of his poems, which was published with an 
Introduction by Mr. Edmund Gosse, required five 
substantial volumes. Since then the additions to 
his poetic produce have been considerable. A se- 
lection of his poems with a sympathetic Preface 
by Mr. William Dean Howells was recently pub- 
lished. 

In the recent death of Professor B. M. Meyer 
of the University of Berlin, literary scholarship 
lost one of its most brilliant exponents. He began 
his career in 1886 by a study in comparative lit- 
erature : " Swift und Lichtenberg." In the same 
year appeared his " Grundlagen des Mittelhoch- 
deutschen Strophenbaus," and three years later 
"Altgermanische Poesie." From the study of the 
older period he now turned to modern times, pub- 
lishing in 1896 his famous Goethe biography which 
established him in the front rank of historians of 
modern German letters. A collection of essays, 
" Deutsche Charaktere," proved merely a prelude

to what was perhaps the most important of 
Meyer's works : " Die deutsche Literatur des 
neunzehnten Jahrhunderts." 

John Muir, who died December 24 at Los Ange- 
les, was a geologist, naturalist, and explorer whose 
personality endeared him to a large circle of 
friends, as well as to the many who knew him only 
through his books. He was born at Dunbar, Scot- 
land, April 21, 1838, and came to America with 
his parents in 1850, to settle in the Wisconsin 
wilderness near the Fox River. Muir's first 
botanical and geological excursions were made in 
the Great Lakes region, in Wisconsin, Indiana, 
Michigan, and Canada. His first trip to Califor- 
nia, where he arrived in April, 1868, was made by 
way of Cuba and the Isthmus of Panama. There- 
after he devoted himself chiefly to a study of the 
Sierras, though he made more than one journey 
into arctic regions, and discovered in Alaska the 
great glacier which bears his name. Muir worked 
hard for forest preservation and it was largely as 
a result of his writings that the present national 
parks and reserves were established. Among his 
books are " The Mountains of California," " Our 
National Parks," " The Yosemite," and, of especial 
interest, his autobiographical chapters published 
under the title of " The Story of My Boyhood and 
Youth." ^ ==== _ ==== __

Octavo. Illustrated with collotype plates. 300 copies on Dutch

" No one has made the mysterious giant of the renais- 
sance live for us in the same degree. By letting the higher 
faculty of imagination connect Michel Angelo with the 
human race and its common characteristics, the author has 
brought him as close to us as may be in the case of a per- 
sonality so aloof."

James Huneker, in the North Ameri- 
can Review. $1.25 net; postage extra. 



America 

and 

The World War 

By Theodore Roosevelt 

"The most important lesson for the 
United States to learn from the present 
war is the vital need that it shall at once 
take steps to prepare." 

Here, in this one vigorous sentence 
of the Foreword, is stated the thesis 
of the book. Following this definite 
plan, he works out with careful argu- 
ment his reasons for believing that 
"all the actions of the ultra-pacifists 
for a generation past, all their peace 
congresses and peace conventions have 
amounted to precisely and exactly 
nothing in advancing the cause of 
peace."

The Political 

Thought 

of Heinrich von 

Treitschke 

By H. W. Carless Davis 

Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford. 

In addition to giving an account of 
the early life of Treitschke and his rela- 
tions with Bismarck, the book contains 
an exposition of the political philosophy 
now in vogue in Germany, showing how 
the thought of Treitschke was influ- 
enced by the events of his own life- 
time, and how his famous lectures on 
Polilik grew out of polemical essays 
which he wrote on current questions of 
German politics. The reader here 
gets a symmetrical and coordinated 
restatement of the positions now held 
by the dominant element of the German 
people.

national politics. At the outbreak of

THE PATROL OF THE SUN DANCE TRAIL 



Like THE SKY PILOT, Connor's latest novel lives on, not merely in the book-shops but in the hearts of its 

readers, because of its drama, its tenderness of young love. Its hero is the ideal of virility Corporal Cameron 

of the North West Mounted Police, who through blinding blizzard and the perilous mountain night followed 

tirelessly on the trail of an Indian traitor. 

"The spirit of the open spaces; the beauty of the frontier that holds men surely under its subtle spell, in a story 

of crowding incident." Boston Transcript. 

Decorative jacket and end-papers. Net, $1.25 

Marie Corelli INNOCENT: Her Fancy and His Fact 

Because for years Miss Corelli has made this her labor of love, it promises to keep on appealing to her readers 
as has THELMA, the Irish lassie who laughed and dreamed, rode through the golden leagues of the wheatlands, 
fought gamely for love, and smiled her way into the sympathies of thousands of readers. 
"With consummate skill, the whole heart of a woman is shown to us. Innocent is one of the heroines that will 
never be forgotten." W. Robertson NicolL Net, $1.35 

Gilbert Parker YOU NEVER KNOW YOUR LUCK 

The months merely increase the popularity of this new tale of the Northwest, in which Parker has added to the 

strength of THE RIGHT OF WAY a new sweetness in the picture of Kitty Tynan.

Hugh Walpole THE DUCHESS OF WREXE

by the growing vogue of his latest novel, THE DUCHESS OF WREXE, the story of democracy's triumph over 
age-rotten aristocracy. Net, $1.4O

J. D Beresford THE HOUSE IN DEMETRIUS ROAD 

There are about 50,000 people in the United States who definitely appreciate a profound realistic novel. This

AN AMERICAN LITERATURE. 



Professor Brander Matthews is of the opin- 
ion that American literature has no existence 
apart from English literature. His opinion, 
since he is nothing if not orthodox in his view 
of literature, is probably that of the majority 
of those who have considered the point. We 
are inclined to agree with him as to the fact. 
But Professor Matthews offers an explanation 
which is something more than an interpreta- 
tion of history. It is a bold prophecy of the 
future. And who agrees with a prophet? 

Professor Matthews says, in his Introduc- 
tion to "The Oxford Book of American 
Essays," that: 

" Of course, when we consider it carefully we 
cannot fail to see that the literature of a language 
is one and indivisible and that the nativity or the 
domicile of those who make it matters nothing. 
Just as Alexandrian literature is Greek, so Amer- 
ican literature is English; and as Theocritus de- 
mands inclusion in any account of Greek literature, 
so Thoreau cannot be omitted from any history of 
English literature as a whole. The works of 
Anthony Hamilton and Rousseau, Mme. de Stael 
and M. Maeterlinck are not more indisputably a 
part of the literature of the French language than 
the works of Franklin and Emerson, of Hawthorne 
and Poe are part of the literature of the English 
language." 

In other words, American literature is a part 
of English literature and must always and 
inevitably continue to be so unless we on 
this side of the Atlantic should develop a new 
language. 

It is only fair to add that after having thus 
denied the possibility of nationality in litera- 
ture (within the same language), Professor 
Matthews goes on to admit that owing to a 
slight difference in the social atmosphere and 
the social organization of the United States 
there is "an indefinable and intangible flavor 
which distinguishes" Franklin, Emerson, 
Walt Whitman, and Mark Twain from Steele, 
Carlyle, Browning, and Lamb ; that the writ- 
ers of this country "cannot help having the 
note of their own nationality." But it is evi- 
dent that he considers the difference subtle 
rather than important. 

Whether the difference is important or not 
depends on whether it is now as great as it 
will ever be. It has not in the least occurred 



38 



THE DIAI, 



[Jan. 16 



to Professor Matthews that the time may come 
when life in the United States will be as differ- 
ent from life in the British Isles as life in 
Russia now is. But that is among the possi- 
bilities of the future. 

An identity of language may be the strong- 
est connection between two nations. Language 
is the mother of ideas; indeed, words are 
ideas. To own the same language has always 
meant to own the same feeling about funda- 
mental things. However greatly the next cen- 
tury may change either the Americans or the 
English, they will tend strongly to remain 
together in their conception of life, not 
merely because many of the same forces will 
act upon both but because each will so easily 
communicate and exchange with the other. 

Nevertheless, there are political, geograph- 
ical, and racial factors which may profoundly 
modify our present likeness to England. The 
case of politics, particularly of international 
relations, has been discussed so much that we 
need only mention it. The great war in Eu- 
rope may not affect us in any direct or impor- 
tant way ; it may not greatly affect the future 
of the British Isles. But the possibilities are 
obvious enough. The effects of geographical 
conditions on national character have only 
begun to be studied, and are little understood ; 
but the idea that the climate of the United 
States is producing an American type, distinct 
from the British, may be something more than 
an academic theory; and climate is only one 
of several aspects of geography. The part 
which race plays in making national character 
is, of course, the most important ; and nothing 
is clearer than that the blood of the American 
people is no longer the blood of the British 
Isles. 

It is true that the English, Scotch, and Irish 
founded the republic ; and their ideas politi- 
cal, social, and moral still dominate it. The 
twenty or thirty American essayists whom 
Professor Matthews has included in his an- 
thology are those of men whose ancestors came 
from the British Isles. And if tw T o of the most 
inexcusable defects of his choice w r ere cor- 
rected, the omission of Mark Twain and the 
inclusion of Mr. Nicholas Murray Butler, this 
fact would not be altered. Indeed, it is a typi- 
cal fact. American writers have so far been 
quite as English in blood as they have been in 
language. The same could be said of nineteen 
out of twenty Americans distinguished by 
other than literary achievement from 1776 to 



now. It could almost be said of the educated 
classes. The proportion of English names in 
a list of the undergraduates at Dartmouth or 
Princeton or Harvard is still large, though not 
as large as it was. It is only when one exam- 
ines the roll of Columbia, where Jewish names 
are very numerous; or of Wisconsin, where it 
is German names ; or of Minnesota, where it is 
Norse names, that the coming change is appar- 
ent. The immigrants from the south of 
Europe, even the Russians, will be slower to 
send their sons and daughters to the universi- 
ties than the immigrants of Teutonic stock 
have been. But whether they send them or 
not, they will need only to remain here to 
modify us. 

The battle of ideas is never still. We think 
of the German citizens of this country as 
differing with the older American stock only 
in respect to the institution of beer, of the 
Norse peoples as distinguished by no differ- 
ence of custom or ideas, of the Jews as a race 
peculiarly adaptable ; and as for the Italians, 
the Greeks, the Slavs we think they do 
not count at all. We should know better. 
We should realize that when "Who's Who" 
no longer presents a preponderance of Brit- 
ish names, American institutions will have 
changed. 

But in addition to the battle of ideas there 
is the struggle of blood, which is only occasion- 
ally fought out with rifles as it is now being 
fought out in Europe. All the w r hite races 
represented in America are beginning to in- 
termarry. But biology does not promise that 
the result will be a composite type in which 
the characters we call Anglo-Saxon will 
predominate. We in America may remain 
descendants of British ancestors in those char- 
acters which we care most about, we may 
continue our present institutions though it 
is to be hoped that we shall be able to ex- 
change some of them for better ones but we 
have no guarantee that this is in the nature of 
things. Indeed, we know that there is no 
assimilation of races without modification. 
We cannot be certain that so much as the 
language will remain to us. Our vernacular 
may be so modified that there will be more 
difference between the speech of an American 
and an Englishman than there is now between 
the speech of an Italian and a Spaniard. 

But long before that happens we shall have 
begun to produce an American literature dis- 
tinct from English literature.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

NATURE-STUDY TRANSMUTED INTO LITERA- 
TURE is what the reader finds, to his delight, 
in the books of such gifted naturalists as 
White of Selborne, Richard Jefferies, Tho- 
reau, Professor Fabre, Mr. John Burroughs, 
and that other John so commonly associated 
with "John of the birds," namely, John 
Muir, or "John of the mountains." Wide- 
spread is the regret caused by the death, on 
the day before Christmas, of the famous dis- 
coverer of glaciers, explorer of the wilds of 
many lands, geologist, naturalist, and writer 
(of too few books). Mr. Muir was born at 
Dunbar, Scotland, April 21, 1838; received 
a Spartan upbringing at the hands of a 
father who belonged decidedly to the old 
school; migrated with that parent and a 
brother and sister to this country in 1849, 
rural Wisconsin being the goal of their pil- 
grimage ; won for himself a university educa- 
tion, or such branches thereof as appealed to 
him, at Madison; and thereafter became a 
wandering student of the wonders of the uni- 
verse as displayed in more or less accessible 
quarters of this planet. Honorary degrees 
and society memberships and other distinc- 
tions came to him unsought, in sufficient 
abundance, and his name as author is at- 
tached to "The Mountains of California," 
"Our National Parks," "Stickeen, the Story 
of a Dog," "My First Summer in the 
Sierra," "The Yosemite," and the extremely 
interesting account of his boyhood and youth 
which was the last book to come from his 
hand, though his fertility in magazine and 
other periodical articles continued to a later 
date. But he w r as too restless, too eager to be 
doing and seeing, to submit willingly to the 
drudgery, as he regarded it, of authorship. 
Perhaps he acquired an early distaste for the 
printed page, as contrasted with the mar- 
vellous book of nature, under the harsh 
discipline of his Dunbar schoolmaster, who 
compelled him to learn Latin and French and 
English grammars by heart, and of his father, 
who piled on top of that an immense amount 
of Bible-reading, making the boy commit to 
memory so many verses every day that, as 
the victim himself says, in terms that are 
hardly credible, by the time he was eleven 
years old he "had about three-fourths of the 
Old Testament and all of the New by heart 
and by sore flesh. I could," he continues, 
" recite the New Testament from the begin- 
ning of Matthew to the end of Revelation 
without a single stop" which, if true, would 
put even Macaulay's feats of memory in the 
shade. But all this was a weariness and a vexa- 
tion to the outdoor enthusiast who, when his 



father told him and his brother Davy that 
they need not learn their lessons for the next 
day, for they were "gan to America thel 
morn," looked forward with ecstasy to the 
land where there was ' ' no more grammar, but 
boundless woods full of mysterious good 
things, trees full of sugar, growing in ground 
full of gold; hawks, eagles, pigeons, filling 
the sky; millions of birds' nests, and no 
gamekeepers to stop us in all the wild, happy 
land." . .. . 

THE MIND 's GAMBOL is not the least of intel- 
lectual recreations. It is a pastime in which 
many a nimble-witted writer has found keen 
delight, to the no small enjoyment of his 
readers. Walter Bagehot confessed his love 
for playing with his mind, as he phrased it. 
Emily Dickinson's wit was what her sister, in 
writing of her soon after her death, called 
"a Damascus blade gleaming and glancing in 
the sun." Colonel Higginson, her correspon- 
dent and trusted friend for a quarter of a 
century, wrote of her fondness for "phrases 
so emphasized as to seem very wantonness 
of over-statement, as if she pleased herself 
with putting into words what the most ex- 
travagant might possibly think without say- 
ing. " Her niece, in selecting and editing 
some passages of intimate correspondence for 
the current "Atlantic," says that "the joy of 
mere words was to Aunt Emily like red and 
yellow balls to the juggler," and speaks felici- 
tously of ' ' the gambol of her mind on paper, ' ' 
and of her pen "scarcely hitting the paper 
long enough to make her communication intel- 
ligible." One might liken her style to the 
humming-bird, come and gone with a flash 
and a whir "a resonance of emerald, a rush 
of cochineal," as she herself expresses it in 
some exquisite lines on that coruscating epi- 
tome of life and fire. Characteristic was her 
shy way of communicating by little scraps of 
letters with her brother's family next door, 
"a hedge away," as she put it, and separated 
by a lawn ' ' crossed by a ribbon path just wide 
enough for two who love." From the above- 
mentioned epistolary fragments a few spark- 
ling bits may here be not out of place. Their 
epigram sometimes verges on obscurity; but 
to be obscure, argues Coleridge, is sometimes 
complimentary to the reader. Here is a cryp- 
tic passage: "To do a magnanimous thing 
and take one's self by surprise, if one is not 
in the habit of him, is precisely the finest 
of joys. Not to do a magnanimous thing, 
notwithstanding it never be known, notwith- 
standing it cost us existence, is rapture her- 
self spurn." And again: "To the faithful, 
absence is condensed presence. To the others 
but there are no others." To an absent

friend she writes: "So busy missing you I 
have not tasted Spring. Should there be 
other Aprils we will perhaps dine." Her 
oddly apposite choice of adjectives is almost 
startling. A little nephew is told by her that 
"Vinnie and Grandma and Maggie all give 
their love, Pussy her striped respects." Often 
her little message takes the form of verse. 
Here is a picture of ineluctable fate : 
" It stole along so stealthy, 
Suspicion it was done 
Was dim as to the wealthy 
Beginning not to own." 


A MARK TWAIN OF THE GHETTO Solo- 
mon Rabinowitz is his name, Sholom Alei- 
chem his pseudonym is writing for the 
Yiddish press of New York stories that are 
said to be the delight of their readers; but 
Yiddish is so little familiar to the majority of 
New Yorkers, and of Americans in general, 
that it grieves one to think of the number of 
laughs and chuckles that will die unborn for 
the lack of a wiser choice, on Mr. Rabinowitz 's 
part, in selecting his literary vehicle. From 
his home city comes the report that he found 
himself interned (to all practical purposes) 
in Germany last summer by the outbreak of 
the war, and it was only when his admirers 
on Manhattan Island, learning of his plight 
and bewailing the enforced suspension of his 
contribution to their merriment, clubbed to- 
gether and effected his deliverance, that he 
was able to return to these shores and resume 
his literary activities. In a passage, ostensi- 
bly autobiographic, translated for the Boston 
"Transcript," he says: "I am a Droschnar, 
which means I came from Droschna, a small 
town of the Poliver district a very small 
town. To-day Droschna is already a city, 
with trains and a railroad station. When it 
became a railroad station the whole world 
envied us. Just think ! a railroad ! Every- 
body thought it was a godsend, a chance of 
making a living. We would all grow rich, all 
begin shovelling gold. Jews from the sur- 
rounding villages began pouring into the city. 
The inhabitants began rebuilding their houses 
and enlarging their stores; the tax on meat 
was raised. We began to think of getting a 
new butcher, of building a new synagogue, 
and of putting aside another field for a ceme- 
tery. All in all, it was a great time." A 
touch of Mark Twain makes itself felt in the 
cemetery enterprise, but probably this author 
would like better to be commended for his 
own merits than for any borrowed (even un- 
consciously borrowed) excellence. His fun 
seems to be all his own, at times not over- 
refined, but what great humorist has escaped 
that criticism? 



BIBLIOPATHOLOGY, if the word is allowable, 
was the subject of some characteristic re- 
marks from Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers in 
a recent talk before the Springfield (Mass.) 
Women's Club. Playfully posing as the 
mouthpiece of his friend Bagster, founder of 
the Bibliopathic Institute for the Book Treat- 
ment, the speaker discoursed entertainingly 
and wittily on "The Therapeutic Value of 
Literature." A new definition of literature 
was, in passing, struck out somewhat as fol- 
lows : ' ' Literature is a vast stock of thoughts 
in a variety of forms that have been thought 
over by interesting people and have become 
so organized that they are not only food but 
medicine for others." Considering a book as 
a literary prescription put up by a competent 
person, the lecturer goes on to say that "a 
proper prescription contains four constitu- 
ents, a basis, or chief ingredient, an adju- 
tant to assist the action, a corrective to lessen 
any evil effects, and a vehicle to make it suit- 
able for administration and pleasant to the 
patient. These constituents may be used to 
test the literary style of books. For instance, 
Henry James, one of whose sentences may be 
read at one sitting, has a sound basis, with 
parenthetical clauses to provide the vehicle, a 
corrective to lessen any evil effects, but lacks 
the adjutant to quicken the action." In 
similar pleasant vein the speaker observes that 
"the young people of each generation are the 
poison squad for the new books. If they sur- 
vive, then the older people, whose maxim is 
'safety first,' begin to take up the same books. 
Then there are the counter-irritants, often 
confused with true stimulants. A counter- 
irritant makes the patient forget irritation in 
one part of the body by creating disturbance 
in another part. In medicine, mustard and 
turpentine are counter-irritants; in literary 
values George Bernard Shaw is the best 
counter-irritant. This is the type of book that 
makes you feel bad in a new spot. They 
make you see yourself as those see you who 
don't like you." 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

A BLAST FROM LONDON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
It is interesting, as it is perhaps flattering, to see 
myself bracketed with the late Lord Tennyson (in 
your leader of November 1 on " The Younger Gen- 
eration " as a sort of alternate cock-shy for warring 
poets, but I cannot admit that you have accurately 
denned the issue. This issue as I see it is not 
whether young poets " believe " in me or in Tenny- 
son, but whether or no they believe that poetry had 
traditions, even traditional freedoms before, say, 
1876 ; whether poetry is good or bad according to 



1915] 



THE DIAJL 



41 



some standard derivable from the full mass of 
poetry of Greece and China and France and the 
world generally, or whether poetry is good or bad 
according to the taste of American magazine editors 
of 1876. 

I still preserve the illusion that there once were 
American magazine editors who cared for litera- 
ture, as they conceived it. It may be that I am 
wrong, and that they have uniformly held the com- 
mercial viewpoint, Avhich some of them now openly 
hold. It may be sheer idiotic idealism to contend 
that the editors of papers like "Harper's Magazine" 
and " The Century Magazine " are in positions of 
some power, and that their position entails some 
responsibility both to the public and to creative 
genius. In actual working I find that there can be, 
apparently, no truce between any of the honest 
men of my generation and these magazines. One 
finds editorial ignorance, and callousness to any 
standards save the fashion of 1876. One finds a 
rooted prejudice, a sheer cliff of refusal, against 
"matter too unfamiliar to our readers." That 
phrase is used over and over again. A public that 
took as much interest in good literature as it takes 
in the tariff on wool, would drive out any editor 
who thus should set himself against all invention, 
all innovation, and all discovery. 

There is no culture that is not at least bilingual. 
We find an American editor (whom it would, of 
course, be a breach of confidence to name) who 
in 1912 or 1913 writes of Henri de Regnier and 
M. Remy de Gourmont as "these young men." 
The rest of his sentence is to say that their work is 
unknown to him. Note that this lacuna in his 
mental decorations does not in the least chagrin 
him. He has no desire to add to his presumably 
superabundant knowledge. To say that the letters 
of a certain editor now admitted incompetent 
(even in America) and after long years dismissed, 
used to be handed about London as examples of the 
incredibly ridiculous, is putting it mildly. 

No, cher m.onsieur, you put it wrongly when you 
say the young poets seem to care whether one 
believe in me or in Tennyson. You should write, 
they care whether or no one has considered the 
standards of excellence to be found in Villon and 
the Greek anthology ; they care whether the editors 
who criticize them have ever heard of Stendhal; 
whether one believe that verse should be as well 
written as prose ; whether an author should be him- 
self or a mimicry. 

Anent which, take two sentences from the edito- 
rials of " The Century Magazine." Note that the 
<! new editor" of this magazine has been recom- 
mended to me as a "progressive." Here are his 
words : 

" We wish to make the fiction in this magazine come 
as near to truth as circumstances permit . . ." 

Shades of Flaubert, and Stendhal, and of every 
honest creator in letters ] I 
Second example: 

" The contributors make the magazine and the 
magazine makes the contributors." 

There's another nice chance for literature to come 
through the magazines. Has any first-class work 
of any sort ever been done to the specifications of a 



machine? And a machine for pleasing the popu- 
lace at that I 

No, cher monsieur, leave my name and my per- 
sonal reputation out of it. Ask whether the 
younger generation wants America to produce real 
literature or whether they want America to con- 
tinue, as she is at the present moment, n joke, a 
byword for the ridiculous in literature, and the 
younger generation will answer you. 

Investigate the standards and the vitality of the 
standards of the "best editorial offices," and see 
what spirit you find there. See whether they 
believe that art is, in any measure, discovery. See 
whether there is any care for good letters, even if 
they care enough for good letters to be in any way 
concerned in trying to find out what makes, and 
what makes for, good letters. 

Bej'ond this it seems to me that you make a mis- 
take in dubbing Mr. Henry James, for instance, an 
European. A deal of his work is about American 
subjects. Is a man less a citizen because he cares 
enough for letters to leave a country where the 
practice of them is, or at least seems, well-nigh 
impossible, in order that he may bequeath a heri- 
tage of good letters, even to the nation which has 
borne him? 

It is not that the younger generation has not 
tried to exist " at home." It is that after years of 
struggle, one by one, they come abroad, or send 
their manuscripts abroad for recognition; that

ENTERTAINING GENIUS UNAWARES. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
An employer, in search of clerks, looked through 
the " situations wanted " column of a New York 
newspaper the other day and remarked, " When I 
see the number of men who advertise for a position 
' at anything ' and urge as a reason for their 
employment, the fact that they speak three or more 
languages, I feel less ashamed of the fact that I am 
a man of one tongue." This is American reasoning 
right enough. If an accomplishment can not be 
converted into dollars and cents, it seems to us a 
useless possession. We prefer to read our foreign 
books in translation, and there is no doubt but that 
the professional translator usually gets more out of 
a foreign author than we ourselves could extract 
with the aid of a phrase-book and a bi-lingual dic- 
tionary. There are times, however, when our igno- 
rance of foreign literature becomes so obvious as to 
be embarrassing. When Senor Ruben Dario ar- 
rived in New York not long ago, we went about 
asking one another, " Who is this Dario, and what 
has he done?" And this same Dario is the fore- 
most poet in the Spanish tongue to-day, author of 
some twenty-odd books of poetry and prose, and 
acknowledged a classic writer by all Spanish- 
speaking peoples. ROBERT j g H()REg>

SOME LESS AUTOCRATIC ASPECTS OF 
"CzAR" REED.* 



It is twelve years since Thomas B. Reed's 
sudden and too-early death, and a few years 
more since he ceased, by his own choice, to be 
a conspicuous figure in our national govern- 
ment; but popular interest in his decidedly 
original yet typically American personality 
is still strong enough to ensure a welcome to 
Mr. Samuel W. McCall's biography of the 
man, which has just appeared under the 
sanction and with the cooperation of sur- 
viving members of the Reed family. Mr. 
McCall's twenty years in Congress and the 
Maine statesman 's term of service in the same 
legislative body overlapped by six years; 
the two represented the same political party 
and had much in common in their political 
views and their high ideals of national policy ; 
and therefore the younger is by no means 
unqualified to give a genuinely appreciative 
account of the other's achievements in public 
life. It is this public rather than the more 
personal and private side of Mr. Reed that 
receives especial attention in the book, and 
such a survey naturally involves some discus- 
sion of the more important political questions 
with which he was concerned, though the 
biographer has shown commendable restraint 
in subordinating his own opinions to the 
presentation of those held by the subject of 
his biography. 

Reed's large and richly endowed nature 
had qualities that remind us now of one and 
now of another illustrious character of his 
own or of an earlier time. In Yankee shrewd- 
ness, the apt use of homely illustration, readi- 
ness with a timely Biblical phrase or allusion, 
and, with it all, a sturdy advocacy of fair 
play, he was not unlike Lincoln, whom he was 
fond of quoting, on occasion, as when, in argu- 
ing against our Philippine policy, he cited 
Lincoln's "government of the people, by the 
people, for the people." Like Lincoln, he 
first made his mark as a country lawyer, and 
he sat in his state legislature before passing 
to a more honored seat in Congress. Like 
Lincoln, too, he served his country in time of 
war though it was in the navy, as acting 
assistant paymaster on board a gunboat, not 
in a land campaign against the Indians 
and he likewise indulged in subsequent 
humorous reference to his martial exploits. 
In certain other aspects, not those of the 
statesman, he irresistibly suggests Mark

McCall. Illustrated. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. 



Twain, with whom he enjoyed a close friend- 
ship in his last years. He had Mr. Clemens 's 
habit of making his wife his confidant and 
adviser in the larger affairs of his calling. 
"She became his best critic, whose judgment 
he sought and followed, ' ' says his biographer. 
"It was his habit to rehearse to her what- 
ever he wrote or proposed to speak upon 
important occasions. Among his unpublished 
manuscripts is one, brilliant but rather de- 
nunciatory in tone, which bears upon it the 
note in his handwriting, 'Not published, by 
order of madam.' ' How many a Mark 
Twain manuscript met with a similar fate at 
the hands of the judicious Mrs. Clemens! 
Curiously alike, also, the two men seem to 
have been in some of those minor preferences 
that betray character. Mark Twain's fond- 
ness for his pet cats and kittens is notorious. 
Reed's relish for certain characteristic quali- 
ties in Tabby and Tom was evident. A paper 
prepared by him on "Our Cat" (Anthony, 
originally called Cleopatra, until it was dis- 
covered that this name was inappropriate) 
has passages that might have been written by 
his illustrious contemporary. Like the au- 
thor of "The Innocents Abroad," Reed was 
"an indefatigable sightseer," with a lively 
interest in foreign lands and a zest for for- 
eign travel. On one occasion at least the two 
men enjoyed an extended cruise in each 
other's company in domestic waters, at the 
invitation of their common friend, H. H. 
Rogers, owner of the yacht ' ' Kanawha. ' ' For 
details see Mr. Paine 's biography of Mark 
Twain, and chapter twenty-two of the book 
under review. 

The record of Reed's college course at Bow- 
doin shows him to have been a good scholar 
without strenuous effort, and a participant in 
all wholesome student activities, a member of 
his class crew, one of the editors of the college 
paper, active in a local chess club, and mighty 
in debate, being one of the leading spirits in 
the Bowdoin Debating Club as well as a 
prominent member of the Peucinian Society, 
where this form of intellectual athletics was 
cultivated. Thrown partly upon his own 
resources for the payment of his college bills, 
he used to teach district school in the winter 
vacation, as was then the approved custom of 
impecunious and ambitious collegians. But 
even with the best of will to make his way 
through and win his diploma, he found him- 
self so nearly stranded toward the end of his 
senior year that he had accepted the necessity 
of leaving college without a degree when 
assistance was offered by "William Pitt Fes- 
senden, father of Reed's room-mate, and 
gratefully accepted. This timely provision of

funds was, of course, not forgotten by the 
beneficiary, who early repaid the loan with 
interest. School-teaching, law-study, and 
naval service filled the first few years after 
his graduation, but in 1865 he established 
himself in his native city of Portland as a 
practising lawyer, and less than three years 
later entered upon that course of political 
activity which was destined to extend nearly 
to the end of his life. Successively repre- 
sentative in the Maine legislature, senator in 
the same body, and attorney-general, he re- 
ceived the nomination and election to Con- 
gress from his district in 1876, and continued 
to represent that district until 1899. when the 
action of the administration in taking on the 
"last colonial curse of Spain" found him so 
little in sympathy with so un-American a 
course that he resigned his seat and retired to 
private life. Referring to the proposed plan 
of subjugating the Filipinos, he said to his 
trusted friend and secretary, Mr. Asher C. 
Hinds: "I have tried, perhaps not always 
unsuccessfully, to make the acts of my public 
life accord with my conscience, and I can not 
now do this thing." This, too, when he had 
just been re-elected by the customary over- 
whelming majority to the succeeding Con- 
gress, and was sure of a renewal of the speak- 
ership, an office of which he had once declared 
that it had but one superior and no peer. 
That one superior, of course, was the presi- 
dency, to which he came near being nominated 
by the convention that finally gave its vote to 
McKinley in 1896. 

Without following more in detail the rise 
of Reed from a position of local to one of 
national if not worldwide fame, let us add a 
few characteristic utterances of his, as re- 
corded by his faithful biographer, and thus 
fix in mind more clearly what manner of man 
he was in his thought and word and action. 
From an address delivered at Portland in his 
earlier life, we select, partly for the benefit 
of young college graduates, the following: 

" Perhaps the most useless piece of furniture on 
the footstool for the first two or three years is the 
college graduate, whose scholarship was a comfort 
to the professors and an annoyance to his com- 
petitors. These years are a worry to the scholar 
himself. He has to take all that time to get right 
with the world, to find the other standards by 
which he must measure his efforts, and to realize 
the nothingness of the honors he has won." 

To about the same period, or to one a little 
earlier, belongs a vigorous assertion of his 
religious beliefs and disbeliefs, addressed to 
the pastor of his church in Portland. There 
is something rather refreshing in such pas- 
sages as this, for example : 



" I do not believe in an Atonement, because I 
cannot see its necessity. The whole idea strikes 
me as artificial. If all our sins and their effects 
are to be washed away by vicarious suffering and 
we are to find ourselves pure and perfect when we 
touch the other shore, the problem of 'Recognition 
in Heaven' is going to be terribly complicated. It 
is needless perhaps to say that I am not persuaded 
of the 'fall of man' j and as for that apotheosis of 
lounging, the life in the Garden of Eden, I believe 
in it as little as I do in the Saturnia Regna. If 
that Paradise had ever existed and man had grown 
up in it, it would have been merely a Paradise of 
fools. It is only by fighting the devil that we ever 
get to be anything." 

In an address on the tariff question, given 
at Philadelphia in 1884, occurs a passage in 
somewhat the same tone as the foregoing, 
which is separated from it by twenty-one 
years in time. 

" The forces of evil are as continuous and deter- 
mined as the forces of right, and I am sorry to say 
that right is only right by a very small majority 
that has got to be kept up every day. This world 
is one where we cannot always have our own way. 
There have been times when I have not been able 
to have mine. Therefore a good many men that I 
would have liked to punish are still flourishing 
upon the earth. Life is a perpetual source of dis- 
appointment. You can never do what you would 
like to do. You have always to do the best thing 
you can do." 

Among Reed's papers after his death was 
found one on the subject of Imperialism, ap- 
parently written, says Mr. McCall, during the 
negotiation of the Treaty of Paris and while 
McKinley was touring the West and deliver- 
ing orations on "Destiny." Here is a frag- 
ment of that paper : 

" Human selfishness pervades all human life. It 
is the mainspring of human action. Any man's 
selfishness would wreck all his surroundings were 
it not for the antidote, which is the selfishness of 
all the rest. Therefore if men are to be justly 
governed they must participate in government. 
Do I mean to say that all men are of equal power? 
No, they cannot be. But give every man equal 
rights, and intellect and wisdom will justify them- 
selves by persuading where they have no power to 
command." 

A good, what may even be called a breath- 
ing, likeness of one eminent statesman by 
another is offered to the fortunate reader of 
this book. A more "intimate" biography 
will perhaps some day be prepared by another 
hand ; but meanwhile we are grateful for this 
excellent presentation of the eminent Speaker.

BOOKS ABOUT THE WAR.* 



It is not too much to expect that the present 
war in Europe will afford inspiration and fur- 
nish subject-matter for a large number of very 
good books and for a few really great ones. 
None, however, of the second category, and 
very few of the first, have as yet made their 
appearance. In recent weeks there have come 
into the hands of the reviewer more than a 
dozen books whose publication is to be 
ascribed, with but an exception or two, en- 
tirely to the war. There is not in the lot one 
volume which does not bear evidence of haste 
in preparation, or in publication, or in both. 
Some are written in English of which a good 
journalist would be ashamed. Some are in- 
complete and utterly superficial treatises upon 
their respective subjects. Not one of them 
contains that useful and in these days not 
uncommon device known as an index. 

The country which to date has attracted the 
attention of writers and publishers chiefly is 
Germany. Whether or not the Germans are 
responsible for the war, their purposes, meth- 
ods, and exploits comprise the most dynamic 
and interesting factors in the situation. Fur- 
thermore, the war literature which is printed 
in America or despatched across the Atlantic 
for American consumption emanates mainly 
from English or other quarters where the de- 
sire is to describe the ambitions, real or 
assumed, of Germany in all their iniquity and 
to portray the German menace in all its sup- 
posed seriousness. Of authoritative and read- 
able English and American books on Germany 
there were already, when the war began, 
many. There were studies of German policy, 
surveys of German history, monographs on the 
Kaiser, printed collections of the Kaiser's 
speeches, and works on German sea-power, 
militarism, socialism, government, and a host 
of other concerns. The general reader who 
would know Germany accurately in so far 
at least as a country can be known accurately 
through the reading of books about it can-

not be admonished too strongly to use the 
books of the past ten years liberally and those 
of the past three months sparingly. 

There is an opportunity for some one to 
write a substantial book in which shall be 
traced the origins and development of the 
spirit of militarism in modern Germany. 
Until this task shall have been performed, per- 
sons interested in this subject will be obliged 
to search out the information they desire in 
masses of documents, and especially in the vol- 
uminous writings of great German militarists 
of the type of Nietzsche and Treitschke. Al- 
ready the stimulation of interest in the subject 
has been considerable; and to meet the de- 
mand for information which has arisen, enter- 
prising publishers have put on the market a 
number of books consisting of translated pas- 
sages from the writings of Treitschke. Of two 
at present on the reviewer's desk, the lesser in 
size and importance is "Selections from 
Treitschke 's Lectures on Politics," translated 
by Mr. Adam L. Gowans. The selections here 
given have the merit of following the original 
very closely, and they cover a range of topics 
sufficiently representative to enable the hur- 
ried reader to obtain from them a very fair 
idea of the trend of Treitschke 's thought. 
More important, however, because fuller and 
accompanied by an extended study of Treit- 
schke 's life and work, is Hausrath 's "Treit- 
schke : His Doctrine of Imperial Destiny and 
of International Relations." The extracts 
here given relate exclusively to military and 
international affairs, and, being fairly copious, 
they serve very well to exhibit the great 
apostle of Pan-Germanism at his best. Haus- 
rath was an intimate friend of Treitschke, and 
his biographical sketch has the advantages and 
disadvantages which may be expected to arise 
from such authorship. He depicts with 
marked success the colorful personality of his 
hero and incidentally gives a very good ac- 
count of the life of German university pro- 
fessors a generation ago. But his enthusiasm 
for his subject leads to an estimate of Treit- 
schke 's scholarship which is hardly borne out 
at every point by the facts. 

Of the making of books about the Kaiser 
there is no end. One of the many issued in 
recent weeks bears the title ' ' The Real Kaiser : 
An Illuminating Study" and has been pub- 
lished anonymously, first in England and sub- 
sequently in the United States. We are told 
that the author has had exceptional oppor- 
tunities to study his subject at close quarters. 
This may be true; and it cannot be denied 
that here and there he has a shrewd inter- 
pretation and employs telling phrases. He 
relates a number of episodes that have not

hitherto reached English readers. But inaccu- 
racies are numerous, notably in the chapter in 
which an attempt is made to describe the 
structure and operation of the imperial gov- 
ernmental system; and the book is further 
marred by an occasional unnecessary expres- 
sion of anti-German sentiment. 

A better piece of work is Mr. George Saun- 
ders 's ' ' Builder and Blunderer. ' ' The author 
of this book was for many years Berlin corre- 
spondent of the London "Morning Post" and 
of the London "Times," and his opportunity 
to go behind the scenes was without doubt 
exceptional. The book opens with a reason- 
ably accurate description of the German posi- 
tion at the Kaiser 's accession, and of the events 
attending the accession ; but the major portion 
of it is devoted to an analysis of the Kaiser's 
foreign policy and of his "German world- 
policy." It is maintained that, despite con- 
trary appearances which deceived many, the 
Kaiser has been at all times since his accession 
the principal menace to the peace of the world, 
and in substantiation of the view a long chain 
of incidents in the diplomatic and political 
history of the past quarter-century is re- 
counted. The world, it is affirmed, has been 
supremely disappointed in the development of 
a character which originally seemed uncom- 
monly promising. 

Only a few days before the outbreak of the 
present war there was published in Germany 
a book written by Colonel Frobenius and bear- 
ing a title which may be translated as "The 
German Empire's Hour of Destiny." The 
book won the unreserved praise of the German 
Crown Prince, and of the Prussian militarists 
generally. The author took as the basis of his 
work a book written a few years ago by an 
American student of politics, namely Mr. 
Homer Lea's "The Day of the Saxon." In 
this volume Mr. Lea pictured the dangers 
which threatened the British Empire, arising 
from its decline in fitness for war,- coupled 
with the growing ascendancy and lordliness 
of Germany and Japan. Germany was con- 
ceived to be the most dangerous opponent, and 
the somewhat fantastic idea was exploited that 
England's original mistake lay in her permit- 
ting the unification of Germany to take place. 
Mr. Lea's practical proposition was that Great 
Britain should create an adequate army and 
proceed to the annihilation of her chief con- 
tinental rival. Colonel Frobenius similarly 
maintained that a titanic conflict between 
Great Britain and Germany was inevitable, 
and he placed at the head of his first chapter 
the statement that "the British world empire 
can be saved only by Germany's overthrow," 
the inference being that Britain 's natural pol- 



icy would be the subversion of Germany. It 
was his opinion, however, that the British 
would see the expediency of sparing the Ger- 
man army, to the end that Russia might be 
held in bounds, and that the conflict between 
Britain and Germany would be exclusively, or 
at least primarily, naval. British troops 
might be expected to operate on land only for 
the purpose of driving the German warships 
from protected ports to the open sea where 
they could be engaged by British vessels. 
That war with both England and France was 
coming was expressly predicted. Indeed, one 
chapter was written to demonstrate that as a 
military measure France must declare war 
against Germany in 1915 or 1916, and another 
to show that the hour of the German Empire 
and its allies might come as early as the spring 
of 1915. That the conflict had not broken 
much earlier, that "so favorable an oppor- 
tunity as the war in the Balkans did not fire 
the powder," and that it was only England 
who held back her threatening allies, was 
attributed principally to the "cold-blooded 
British commercial spirit. ' ' There is nowhere 
in print not even in General von Bern- 
hardi's writings a more frank and forceful 
statement of the point of view taken by the 
German authorities in the present conflict. 

In the autumn of 1913 one of the editors of 
the Paris ' ' Figaro, ' ' M. Georges Bourdon, paid 
a visit to Germany with the express purpose 
of ascertaining the actual sentiment of repre- 
sentative Germans toward the French govern- 
ment and people. Interviews were held with 
high officials, party leaders, university profes- 
sors, literary men, and representatives of mili- 
tary and patriotic organizations, and the re- 
sults were published in a series of articles in 
"Figaro." In English translation, these arti- 
cles, with additions, have lately been brought 
out in London in book form under the title 
' ' The German Enigma. ' ' M. Bourdon tells us 
that on his departure for Germany he made a 
determined effort to shake off all his precon- 
ceived opinions, and he confesses freely that 
his experiences showed him the error of some 
of the opinions which, in common with other 
Frenchmen, he had cherished. "We know 
nothing of Germany," he exclaims, "neither 
does she know anything of us." Few books 
are written with loftier purpose, and it must 
be said that the spirit of fairness and of altru- 
ism with which the author begins is sustained 
to the end. The result is an objective, impar- 
tial, and impersonal study. In only the last 
chapter does the author obtrude his private 
views and seek to draw conclusions. His great 
objective is an eloquent, although restrained, 
plea for a Franco-German rapprochement on 



THE DIAL

the basis of continued German possession of 
Alsace-Lorraine and the engagement of the 
Berlin authorities to govern the Alsatians as a 
free, rather than a subjugated, people. Such 
a solution, it was maintained, would involve 
no sacrifice of pride or of dignity by either 
nation, yet it would heal a festering wound 
and would deliver the whole of Europe from 
the crushing burden of military expenditure. 
The picture drawn was roseate, but events 
have proved it only a fleeting vision. The 
book is of interest because it was written from 
a viewpoint seldom assumed in recent years 
by European publicists. 

In ''What Germany Wants" Dr. Edmund 
von Mach has undertaken to supply a con- 
servative answer to a query which in these 
days is on every one's lips. Dr. von Mach is 
an American and a graduate of Harvard, al- 
though of Prussian birth and, in the main, of 
Prussian training. He knows his America 
rather better than do certain other German 
apologists in this country, and the temperate- 
ness of his arguments ought to ensure his book 
a wide and thoughtful reading. The essential 
desire of Germany he defines as follows : 

" Germany wants to keep the confines of her 
home-land inviolate, but is not desirous of joining 
to them new lands of unwilling people. She wants 
to develop her colonies and invest her money in the 
building of extra-territorial railways which will 
ultimately bring her into relation with new mar- 
kets. She wants to develop her home commerce 
and industry, and increase the usefulness of her 
agriculture that she may give employment to a 
population growing at the rate of about a million 
a year. . . . Over and above these desires she has 
the very natural and proper ambition to be worthy 
of her great past and to make her own contribu- 
tions to the civilization of the world. She wants 
social justice, and she wishes to remove from her 
laboring classes the ills of poverty. Germany wants 
peace, for in peace only can she do what she has set 
out to do. She wants an honorable and a stable 
peace, and in so far as the defects of her character 
have been contributory causes to misunderstand- 
ings she wishes to eradicate these defects. She 
desires the good will of the world." 

A convenient handbook for Americans who 
wish to follow the course of the war intelli- 
gently is Professor Albert Bushnell Hart's 
"The War in Europe." This book falls into 
two parts. The first is devoted to a crisp 
description of the general international situa- 
tion in Europe on the eve of the war. The 
second contains an account of the outbreak of 
the war, with chapters on the psychology of 
the war, the question of neutrality, modern 
methods of warfare, the effect of the war on 
the United States, and the possible terms of 
peace. Evidence which has come to light since 
the date of publication would probably cause 



the author to give some of his statements to- 
day a different turn, but of course this was 
inevitable, and on the whole the book remains 
a very fair and substantially accurate piece of 
work. Eminently sensible are the suggestions 
which are offered concerning the necessary 
basis of a true and final peace. Stated briefly, 
they are: (1) Europe must recognize the 
blood kinship of people of the same race, and 
must cease trying to destroy the language and 
traditions of race groups; (2) She must give 
up the idea of compelling large racial units to 
accept a government which is hateful to them ; 
(3) A larger portion of the people must be 
admitted to a share in decisions as to their own 
destiny; (4) No peace can be durable that 
does not provide in some way against the 
causes which have brought about the present 
war, chief among them being the feeling, fos- 
tered by great armaments, that war is a proper 
and manly way of settling national differ- 
ences; and (5) War can be prevented only by 
some sort of world federation in which every 
nation shall have an armed force upon a fixed 
proportion, to be used as part of a contingent 
of a world police. 

It is just conceivable that the war may go 
on undecisively until the nations, from sheer 
exhaustion, shall become willing to terminate 
hostilities and to restore, as nearly as possible, 
the conditions of July, 1914. But it is much 
more likely that one side or the other will be 
definitely victorious, and in this event the map 
of Europe will undoubtedly have to be re- 
made. Dr. Herbert A. Gibbons 's "The New 
Map of Europe" was written in part before 
the outbreak of the war. But chapters were 
appended after the war began, and nowhere 
in English will one find as yet a fuller or better 
discussion of the political and geographical 
changes which the war is capable of pro- 
ducing. Dr. Gibbons has been for some years 
a member of the faculty of Roberts College, 
Constantinople, and he has had varied oppor- 
tunity to acquaint himself with the political 
and military affairs of Europe, especially of 
Europe east of the Adriatic. His present 
chapters cover a wide range from the pass- 
ing of Persia and the problem of the Bagdad 
railway in the east to Alsace-Lorraine and 
Luxemburg in the west. The best are the 
half-dozen or more recounting the military 
and political happenings of southeastern 
Europe since the Turkish revolution of 1908. 
for the author has been an observer of, and 
even a participant in, many of the events of 
which he here writes. In his discussion of the 
present conflict Dr. Gibbons takes the ground 
that Germany forced war on Russia and 
France, that German ambition has long been 



1915]

a menace to all Europe, that Great Britain 
was fully justified in entering the contest, and 
that the violation of the neutrality of Bel- 
gium was not the cause, but only the occasion, 
of British participation. The only way in 
which war could have been avoided last Au- 
gust, we are told, would have been "to allow 
Germany to make, according to her own de- 
sires and ambitions, the new map of Europe."

day with those of fifteen or even ten years 
ago, it is surprising to see how many more 
plays are now getting into print. And these 
are not only plays which have been or might 
be successfully acted; many of them are in- 
tended merely to be read, and could not be 
staged with any hope of interesting an audi- 
ence. Not only does the printed play serve 
as a platform, or at least a soapbox, for peo- 
ple who have a social or political message to 
deliver to the world; it has been seized upon 
even by the lyric poets as a medium for the 
expression of personal emotion. Thus we find 
in our list not only Mr. Brownell preaching 
pacificism, Mr. Francis preaching syndical- 
ism, and M. Andreyev preaching nihilism, but 
Mr. Eobinson and Mr. Tagore translating 
their favorite types of lyric, the puzzle lyric 
and the mystical lyric, into what purports to 
be dramatic form. 

It is perhaps our misfortune that we live 
in an age when nothing can be taken for 
granted. Of course our field of speculation is 
considerably widened ; but this is a poor com- 
pensation for the artistic formlessness and 
poverty which the dissolution of tradition 
involves. We may smile at the simple-mind- 
edness of Aristotle, who thought a play was 
an imitation of action, or of Shakespeare, 
who thought a playwright ought to hold a

mirror up to nature. But the out-of-date 
dramatists who were expected to give pleasure 
by imitating human life in a manner presenta- 
ble on the stage had an immense advantage in 
knowing what was expected of them, and in 
general how they were expected to do it. 
Whether the modern dramatists, unguided by 
a tradition in these respects, will succeed in 
working out a satisfactory artistic form, is a 
hard question. There is no doubt that the 
drama, which had been slumbering in a sort 
of coma of conventionality, has been vitalized 
through the widening of its scope; and 
though many of the playwrights seem to 
struggle vainly with their material, though 
their utterance is stammering and eccentric, 
most of them have something to say and are 
striving toward a comprehensible form. 

Events have made a cruelly sardonic com- 
ment on the rather saccharine optimism of 
' The Unseen Empire." The youthful hero- 
ine, Friderika Stahl, has been left sole owner 
of the Stahl Gun Works, the great manufac- 
turing centre of war material in Germany. 
Absorbed in philanthropic projects among 
her workmen, she has never realized the mean- 
ing of the vast establishment built up by her 
father. Her eyes are opened through the 
attempts of the Emperor to gain more direct 
control of the works, first by marrying her to 
a prince, then, when this fails and war is 
imminent, by forcibly seizing the plant. She 
defeats the second plan by the help of her 
chief electrician, who is also her lover. The 
result is that the Emperor, who, it appears, 
has always objected to war, heads a movement 
for a federation of Europe, and bestows the 
Order of the Red Eagle on the young man 
who thwarted the war plans. The lightning 
change of Emperor and Chancellor from lion 
to lamb would be merely comic if history had 
not made it into a bitter caricature of pacifi- 
cist dreams. 

Mr. Francis's "Change" has for its theme 
the tragic clash of the new and the old in a 
Welsh mining village. In 1911 it won a prize 
offered for the best play by a Welsh author 
dealing with life in Wales. As is often the 
case with prize plays and stories, it is sincere, 
respectable, and rather dull. The action 
moves very slowly; there are three or four 
moderately interesting characters, but none of 
compelling interest; the play lacks focus. 
The writer seems to have been more inter- 
ested in a social condition than in any of his 
characters; and this is to say that as a dra- 
matist he has failed. It is not hard to see 
why the play, to quote the Introduction, "met 
with a most deplorable and undeserved re- 
ception ' ' in New York and Chicago.

THE DIAL 



[Jan. 16 



With a somewhat similar setting the 
mining region of Derbyshire Mr. D. H. 
Lawrence has written a vastly better play. 
In "The Widowing of Mrs. Holroyd" he has 
no social theories to expound, but he is pro- 
foundly interested in Mrs. Holroyd, her chil- 
dren, her drunken husband, and her sober 
and hard-working lover, Blackmore. A de- 
cent woman with ideals of her own, she at 
first gives Blackmore no encouragement; but 
things come to such a pass that she finally 
consents to run away with him, taking her 
two children. Then comes an accident in the 
mine, in which her husband is killed. A 
revulsion of feeling sweeps over her; her 
early love for him returns, and with his old 
mother she weeps passionately over his body. 
The final scene, grimly realistic and of extraor- 
dinary power, shows the two women wash- 
ing the body for burial. The best evidence of 
the author's tact and skill is that the effect 
neither of this scene nor of the play as a 
whole is sordid or depressing ; it is rather, in 
the true sense of the word, tragic. The fault 
of the play is its inconclusiveness, which would 
handicap it on the stage ; but, from the read- 
er's point of view, this is more than redeemed 
by keen insight into character and firm grasp 
of situation. Mr. Lawrence is still a very 
young man; he will be well worth watching. 

From a first-hand study of life we turn to 
a literary echo. Mr. Jesse Lynch Williams 's 
"And So They Were Married" may be best 
described as an American imitation of Mr. 
Shaw 's plays. Surely a man of genius should 
pray thrice daily to be delivered from his 
imitators. They are sure to "show him up," 
magnifying his faults and weaknesses till the 
public turns from him in disgust. No hostile 
criticism can be half so damaging as the 
imitation of the faithful disciple. The reac- 
tion against Mr. Shaw was bound to come; 
and the appearance of a follower like Mr. 
Williams suggests that it is upon us. His 
heroine well knows that by the law of her 
nature she must compel the man with whom 
she is in love to propose to her ; she struggles 
bravely against it, and when in spite of her- 
self she has most obviously forced him into a 
declaration, she says, "in an awed whisper, 
stepping back slowly, ' I 've done it ! I 've done 
it ! I knetv I'd do it ! ' ' But of course she 
will not let a poor scientific man ruin his 
prospects by marrying her. They will 
"belong to each other" without marriage, and 
this she announces to her assembled and 
astounded relatives. To do her lover justice, 
it must be said that at first he objects to this 
programme ; but the ' ' Life Force ' ' has got hold 
of him too; and besides, in defending Helen 



from her incensed family, he has to defend 
her plan. A clever old uncle who is a judge, 
taking unfair advantage of their excitement 
and of the easy-going law of the state, mar- 
ries them on the spot in spite of their teeth ; 
but at the same time he warns Society -that 
a general overhauling is inevitable. Various 
minor characters and incidents make it too 
plain that Mr. Williams is not intentionally 
writing burlesque. 

As the reader begins to turn the pages of 
Mr. Edwin Arlington Robinson's "Van 
Zorn," various questions rise in his mind. 
Who is Van Zorn? Who is Villa Vannevar, 
the heroine? What have been their past rela- 
tions with each other? with George Lucas? 
with Farnham? There is no exposition to 
gratify his curiosity; but he consoles himself 
with the thought that as he goes on these 
matters will become clear. On the contrary, 
he becomes more and more bewildered. 
There is a good deal of more or less clever 
dialogue ; there develops a kind of emotional 
tension, involving the transference of the 
heroine's affections; but Mr. Robinson keeps 
his secrets, or reveals them only in riddles. 
The reader's curiosity is teased very much as 
it is in some of Mr. Robinson's poems. He 
feels that if he could learn something about 
these people they might prove to be interest- 
ing. But perhaps after all they are not peo- 
ple; perhaps they are symbols. The play 
will be a good subject for some future doc- 
tor's thesis; until that appears it will be safe 
to reserve our judgment. 

Mr. Tagore's "King of the Dark Chamber" 
is frankly symbolical; the characters could 
by no possibility be mistaken for real per- 
sons. Lecturers who expound the beauties of 
Tagore before women's clubs will probably 
have no difficulty in explaining that the play 
is an allegory of the conquest of the soul (the 
Queen) by Love (the King), with the help of 
Humility (Surangama), and the discomfiture 
of the King's chief rival, Practical Sagacity 
or Efficiency (Kanchi). The symbolism is 
rather clearer than is usual in Maeterlinck; 
the style is noticeably reminiscent of his. 
There is a good deal of the material of poetry 
floating around in a rather nebulous state, 
and there are some pretty lyrics, one, for in- 
stance, beginning: 
" Open your door. I am waiting. 

The ferry of the light from the dawn to the 
dark is done for the day. 

The evening star is up." 

It is in a way refreshing to turn to the 
"Three Modern Plays from the French." 
Here is no recondite or symbolical meaning, 
no prophet or lyricist disguised as a play-

wright. "We go back with a certain sense of 
relief to the good old triangle. It encloses 
nothing of extraordinary interest, but at least 
we know what to expect. It is odd to see how 
these plays, produced in 1892, 1896, and 
1902, already sound like voices from a past 
generation. Heavens! they seem written 
merely to entertain! In M. Lavedan's 
"Prince D'Aurec" the chief interest is in the 
husband, a fine type of the useless and orna- 
mental French nobleman. Jules Lemaitre's 
"The Pardon" is remarkable as a tour de 
force. The triangle, if I may mix the mathe- 
matical metaphors, is reduced to its lowest 
terms; there are in this three-act comedy 
only three characters. As a piece of techni- 
cal sleight of hand it would be hard to equal. 
In M. Donnay's "The Other Danger" inter- 
est centres in the woman who has a lover with 
whom her innocent daughter falls desperately 
in love. If we take the situation seriously, as 
M. Donnay wishes us to, we can hardly be 
satisfied with his solution. Mme. Jadain 
heroically resigns her lover, commanding him 
to marry Madeleine, and he, though he pro- 
tests a good deal, seems not indisposed to 
consent. 

It must be a grim humorist indeed who 
could find anything amusing in the two plays 
of M. Leonid Andreyev published in the 
' ' Modern Drama Series. " In " Savva ' ' we find 
ourselves in the company of a group of luna- 
tics and idiots. Considerable ingenuity is 
shown in distinguishing various types of men- 
tal alienation; thus we have the drunken 
idiot, the playful idiot, the maniac who has 
committed the unpardonable sin, and the mild 
melancholiac. There is only one really sane 
person in the play. The hero is a young 
nihilist who wishes to destroy every mark and 
sign of civilization and the past, literature, 
art, cities, even clothes, so that the human 
race may begin over again au naturel. If 
they then show any signs of relapsing into 
anything resembling our present civilization, 
he plans to massacre them all. Very appro- 
priately he is torn to pieces by a mob ; but it 
is evident that M. Andreyev regards him as a 
martyr. "The Life of Man," published in 
the same year as ' ' Sawa, " is a far more note- 
worthy performance. It is a sort of morality 
play, in a prologue and five scenes. If the 
philosophy of Mr. Thomas Hardy's novels 
were to be summed up in a short dramatic 
allegory, the result would be something like 
"The Life of Man." The characters are 
Man, his Wife, Father, Relatives, Neighbors, 
Friends, Enemies, etc. Interspersed with the 
dialogue are long choral passages uttered by 
groups of people speaking individually but 



indistinguishably, and headed merely "The 
Drunkards' Conversation," or "The Old 
Women's Conversation." In the form of 
familiar talk, these passages often furnish the 
most poignant comment on the action where 
they seem most irrelevant or frivolous. 
Speaking the prologue, and dominating the 
whole piece, is the dread figure, "Someone in 
Gray called He." He is present in the back- 
ground of every scene, holding in his hand 
the candle which burns gradually lower. He 
listens with equal apathy to the rejoicing of 
Man and his Wife over their first success, to 
their agonizing prayers for the life of their 
child, and to Man's curses when the child 
dies. He is a God of stone. 

It is interesting to compare this twentieth- 
century morality with a morality of the fif- 
teenth century. The message of "Every- 
man" is that the soul of man is a thing of 
infinite value, and that man's life on earth 
has infinite significance. The message of 
' ' The Life of Man ' ' is that the soul of man is 
a trivial toy, and that man's life is infinitely 
meaningless. The fifteenth-century play is 
filled with a sense of the reality of the past, 
of the reality of the future, and of the cru- 
ciality of the present that divides them. In 
the twentieth-century play all are alike empty 
and unreal. 

To turn from these powerful and melan- 
choly productions is like coming out from an 
asylum or an operating-room. Under such 
circumstances, what can be more wholesome 
than to go to a Punch and Judy show ? Some- 
thing of the sort, touched with graceful fancy, 
Sir James M. Barrie (we have not yet become 
accustomed to that "Sir," and it sounds al- 
most as queer as "Sir Mark Twain" would) 
has provided for us in " Pantaloon. ' ' The sec- 
ond of the ' ' Half Hours, " " The Twelve-pound 
Look," is a portrait of an egoist considerably 
less refined than Meredith's hero. In intro- 
ducing him, the author politely but unkindly 
says, "If quite convenient (as they say about 
cheques) you are to conceive that the scene is 
laid in your own house, and that Harry 
Sims is you. ' ' No doubt Harry would be glad 
to be you or anyone else before his interview 
with Kate is over. Kate is his former wife, 
now a "new woman," but not of the type 
familiar in the new drama. Perhaps it would 
not be a bad guess that Sir James and Dr. 
Crothers, who are not afraid of the new 
woman and do not seem to think she will 
prove as destructive as some suppose, are 
nearer right than the alarmists. "Rosalind" 
is a delightful little sketch of the contrast 
between an actress incognita, on a vacation, 
and frankly middle-aged, and the same lady

in her professional character and appear- 
ance. The change is accurately and charm- 
ingly registered in the countenance and 
words of young Charles Roche, just out of 
college and much in love with the beautiful 
actress. The last of the "Half Hours," 
"The Will," is a bit of the tragedy of life as 
it appears in a lawyer's office. It simply 
presents three visits, years apart, made by 
the hero to his lawyer; but one can recon- 
struct the man's whole life from those three 
visits. Philip Ross's experience is not so 
very different from that of M. Andreyev's 
"Man"; yet in total effect the two plays are 
as wide asunder as the poles. In the back- 
ground of the "Life of Man" there are only 
spectres gibbering and flitting through 
vacancy, and the blank and stony stare of the 
insane God. In the background of "The 
Will" is the whole huge and various earth, 
with its forces of good and evil, and its rich- 
ness of real human sorrow and joy. It is 
interesting to speculate as to what would be 
the effect upon M. Andreyev if he could look 
out upon everyday life for an instant through 
Sir James Barrie's eyes. If he survived the 
shock, he would probably suppose, depending 
on his early training, that he had been trans- 
ported either to fairyland or to heaven. Later 
he would reason that he must have been sub- 
ject to a hallucination. Yet the result of such 
a glimpse, even on a logical and unhumorous 
mind, would surely be enlightening. Per- 
haps it would even teach M. Andreyev 
humility. HOMER E. WOODBRIDGE. 



WORRY AXD MODERN I/TFE.* 



The belief is widespread that there are 
more "nervous" people in America than in 
all the other countries of the world taken 
together. But the term, as popularly used, 
does not imply serious disease and usually no 
organic difficulty; it refers rather to mental 
strain and tension, and to that vast brood of 
troubles commonly described by the term 
worry. There is general agreement among 
laymen as well as physicians that American 
life is becoming continually more complex, 
Avith the result that as a people we are "hit- 
ting up the pace ' ' faster and faster as the 
years go by. Take a man of affairs in almost 
any community in this country; he is re- 
quired to adapt himself to a greater number 
of situations and respond to more varied 
stimulations this year than he did last. He

has more problems to solve, and more pres- 
sures to equilibrate or perhaps to resist. If 
things go on as they have been going, he will 
have more adjustments to make next year than 
he has this year. Even in the school, which 
was originally a place of quiet for the purpose 
of encouraging reflective attitudes, there is 
constantly increasing tension because there 
are more subjects to study and tasks to per- 
form each succeeding year. The demands 
upon the schools have already become so 
numerous and burdensome that the chief 
problem discussed to-day in educational meet- 
ings is the pruning of the curriculum so that 
pupils will not be crowded so hard. 

Think of the number of things which a fam- 
ily even in modest circumstances must buy 
to-day in order to keep pace with their neigh- 
bors ! Think of the ' ' amusements ' ' they must 
patronize, the books and periodicals they must 
read, the ' ' functions ' ' they must attend ! And 
then consider especially the burdens imposed 
upon those who are on the firing-line, and 
must furnish the funds for all this unrest and 
striving and struggle ! 

The above reflections are incited by reading 
the books under review. In purpose and gen- 
eral point of view they resemble other books 
that have appeared in America during the past 
decade. It is probable, however, that Dr. 
Sadler's "Worry and Nervousness" is the 
most important and attractive contribution 
that has yet been made to the discussion of 
this subject. It is the work of a scientist, to 
begin with; and its thoroughgoing presenta- 
tion of all aspects of nervous disturbances 
that give rise to worry and that are the out- 
growth thereof is based upon an accurate 
knowledge of the physical and mental laws 
involved. A number of recent writers upon 
this subject have approached it from the 
standpoint of religion Mr. Carey's "New 
Nerves for Old" is written from this point of 
view or hypnotism or morbid psychology; 
but Dr. Sadler writes as a physician, and con- 
sequently one feels that his analysis and sug- 
gestions for the treatment of worry are a little 
more securely grounded than are most of the 
expressions on these topics which one hears or 
reads to-day. 

"Worry and Nervousness" discusses every 
phase of nervousness and its hygiene and! 
treatment; and the discussion throughout is 
presented in a clear, graceful style. The 
varied forms of nervousness are classified 
under seven heads: (1) chronic fear, or 
worry, (2) neurasthenoidia, or near-neuras- 
thenia, (3) neurasthenia, or nervous exhaus- 
tion, (4) psychasthenia, or true brain fag, 
(5) hysteria, the master imitator, (6) hypo-

chondria, or chronic blues, (7) simple melan- 
cholia. Each of these types of nervousness is 
analyzed, and their relations toward one 
another pointed out. The largest general con- 
clusion to be derived from these analyses is 
that under the stress and strain of modern 
life, alike in the case of the worker and the 
social "climber," the vitality of the nervous 
system is lowered, and there follows a host of 
troubles, all springing out of or giving rise to 
fear or w r orry. Dr. Sadler cites a large num- 
ber of concrete examples of the various fears 
he describes, and they are very numerous. 
Modern students of this subject have had to 
develop an extensive vocabulary to describe 
the fears which have been differentiated out 
of the common attitude of worry or dread. 
There is "aerophobia," the dread of fresh 
air, especially night air; "aichmophobia," 
the dread of pointed tools; "kenophobia," 
the fear of emptiness; " brontophobia, " the 
fear of thunder; "acrophobia," the fear of 
high places ; ' ' agoraphobia, ' ' the fear of open 
spaces; "misophobia," the fear of dirt; 
"pathophobia," the fear of disease; "zoopho- 
bia, ' ' the fear of animals, and so on ad libitum. 
Then there are nervous states which are not 
quite of the nature of dread or fear, but which 
nevertheless give rise to the worrying attitude, 
such as the magnification of trifles, worrying 
about the weather, the chronic "kicking" 
habit, and so on through a long list. 

And what is the cause of all these abnormali- 
ties? In some cases, lowered vitality; in 
other cases, strain and stress in maintaining 
existence ; but in most cases in American life 
it is the struggle for more and more things 
and experiences. The results are social mal- 
adjustments which produce sooner or later 
nervous irregularities and mental strains and 
crises. Through twenty interesting chapters, 
the author analyzes and describes typical 
everyday types of worry and fear and 
nervousness, and he gives concrete examples 
of every type. He also presents diagrams 
giving the results of modern research on the 
relations between bodily states and nervous 
and mental reactions. He drives home some 
of his principles by presenting photographic 
and pictorial illustrations of fear, worry, and 
especially of "going the pace" in American 
life. 

But what can be done about it all ? Part II. 
of "Worry and Nervousness" is devoted to a 
discussion of how these troubles may be alle- 
viated. The sum of the whole thing is: let 
the neurasthenic reduce his wants. Let him 
give up thinking about himself, and become 
interested in some other person, or some cause 
of an impersonal character. But fundamen- 



tally he must live a simple, hygienic life. He 
must cut out every form of stimulant and 
narcotic. Alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee, and 
the whole list of narcotic drinks are deadly 
in their effect upon the nervous system. Dr. 
Sadler says that any physician who is thrown 
in contact with a large number of nervous 
cases has it borne in upon him every day that 
the chief enemies of the health and stability 
of the nervous system and the mind are the 
popularly used poisons, alcohol, tobacco, tea, 
and coffee. Tobacco stands foremost among 
the causes of increased blood pressure, which 
drags a whole train of evils in its course. 
Alcohol is next, and then come tea and coffee. 
The author quotes Richardson of England to 
the effect that excessive tea drinking among 
the women of that country has produced a sort 
of semi-hysterical condition. They try to 
relieve this condition by resorting to alcoholic 
stimulants, so that one evil intensifies thei 
other. He also quotes Dr. Bock of Leipzig, 
who has observed the same effects among 
women who are addicted to the use of coffee. 
Even the use of condiments, as pepper, mus- 
tard, vinegar, and the like, is a source of 
nervous irritation and instability. 

Next to hygiene in order of therapeutic 
value in the treatment of nervousness and 
worry is faith simple, trusting faith. Here 
is the physician, looking at the whole matter 
from the physician's point of view, who con- 
cludes that nervous health without faith, is 
impossible. Dr. Sadler and Mr. Carey are in 
agreement in respect to the value of faith in 
preserving healthy nerves. Most of "New 
Nerves for Old" is devoted to impressing this 
view. It would not do to pass over this point 
without quoting a paragraph from "Worry 
and Nervousness" (p. 50) : 

"All faith tendencies are toward mental happi- 
ness and psychical health. All people, good or 
bad, get the physical rewards of faith, regardless 
whether the objects of their faith and belief are 
true or false. Faith reacts favorably upon the 
body independent of the trueness of the object or 
the correctness of the thing believed. Faith is the 
natural, normal, and healthy state of mind for 
man. Faith is the state of mind that ever tends to 
make a man better, stronger, happier, and 
healthier." 

Dr. Sadler discusses the modern use of 
psychotherapy and therapeutic suggestion, 
and indorses these means in many cases. He 
also considers educational therapeutics, the 
strengthening of the will, the value of recrea- 
tion, study, play, work, and social service. In 
particular cases these are all of great value, 
because they relax the tense nerves of the 
neurasthenic and substitute wholesome and 
upbuilding ideas for narrow, self-centred,

and hypochondriacal ones. Mr. Carey ad- 
vances substantially the same views, though 
he does not base his principles upon physical 
and mental laws as Dr. Sadler does. As a 
summary of all his suggestions, Dr. Sadler 
makes self-mastery the supreme aim, which is 
in effect the conclusion reached by Mr. Carey 
and most of the others who have written upon 
this complicated subject in recent times. The 
real secret of nervous and mental health is 
after all to get hold and keep hold of one's 
self in the midst of all the strains and stresses 
of an increasingly complex life. 

The reviewer may perhaps add an opinion 
of his own which seems reasonable in view of 
the principles developed by Dr. Sadler and 
others. Nervousness in all its morbid phases 
seems to show nature's attempt to destroy the 
individual who is not living in accord with her 
laws physical, intellectual, social, and re- 
ligious. And in order to escape from this 
trouble, all remedies must come back in the 
end to simple, rational living first physical, 
then social to live in harmony and good 
will with one's fellows and religious to 
have faith that back of the universe and sup- 
porting it is an all-wise and all- just power and 
personality. Most people who study human 
nature come to this conclusion sooner or 

later - M. V. O'SHEA. 



RECENT FICTIOX.* 



The argument is sometimes made that the 
novelists of our day have, and can have, noth- 
ing really new to tell us. Men and women are 
pretty much the same everywhere, it is said, 
and their passions have been recorded in all 
their variety by the long procession of poets 
and dramatists and story-tellers. In particu- 
lar we are assured that we should be better off 
reading the great Victorians than the novel of 
the season, simply because they did all that 
any of our contemporaries can do and did it 
better. Many of us who are interested in 
novels give this advice lip-service by passing 
it on and do not follow it. One reason is to 
be found in fashion. To the mind which re- 
joices in the "Saturday Evening Post's" 
serials, Thackeray and Dickens are as hope- 
lessly old-fashioned as the clothes of their 
day ; the same is only less true of a more criti- 
cal mind. But there is another reason. It is 
that in certain living writers one may satisfy 
(or only whet?) a curiosity of which Thack-

eray and Dickens knew very little and of 
which they did not always tell what they 
knew. There is one obvious retort to Mr. 
Frank Harris's sneer at Thackeray because he 
did not dare to give Becky Sharp a soul ; it is 
that Becky Sharp exists. There is an equally 
obvious retort to the charge that Dickens saw 
nothing in the lower classes except what was 
funny. It is that the lower classes are funny. 
The fact remains that women quite as wicked 
as Becky Sharp have souls and that the poor 
are a great deal more than amusing. 

It is the fashion just now to belittle science, 
especially the less exact sciences. But science 
does count, even toward the novel. Darwin 
and Karl Marx did not live in vain. Science 
can tell us more about the two great motives 
of human conduct, the erotic and the economic, 
than it once could ; and one of the results of 
the scientific method is a tremendously in- 
creased curiosity about the things it has only 
partially revealed to us. The merest hint of 
new knowledge is enough to create an active 
dissatisfaction with the old. It may be a long 
time before any novelist compels us to under- 
stand what the socialists like to call "the 
working-class mind, ' ' but we can no more rest 
with Dickens 's sense of it than we can rest 
with Thackeray's ideas about women. 

"The Second Blooming" is an example of a 
novel that could hardly have been written a 
generation ago. David Graham Phillips a 
writer whose merits seem to have been hidden 
by his crudity from all but a few critics, like 
Mr. Arnold Bennett dealt often with the 
same general theme: the futility of the lives 
of leisure-class women. But he never worked 
it out as subtly as Mr. George has. The story 
is of three sisters, all of whom are frustrated 
by the lives they lead as the wives of well-to- 
do men. Grace found her only real happiness 
during the three years she conducted a liaison; 
Mary found a certain contentment in many 
children Clara expended most of her surplus 
energy in helping her husband's political 
career. It looks as if Mr. George had set out 
to demonstrate in fiction the feminist theory 
which he has previously expounded in argu- 
ment. But there is more to it than that. Most 
of his interest is in Grace, and her love for 
Enoch Fenor. He tells what went on in her 
mind frankly, honestly, and without preaching 
about it ; so that while one may disapprove of 
Grace, or pity her, or respect her, one can 
neither hail Mr. George as one who perceives 
that love justifies irregularity of conduct nor 
damn him as one who confuses moral values. 
There are some weak places in the story. 
Mr. George has avoided telling just why it was 
that Grace found herself out of love with her

husband; it wasn't, as he would have us be- 
lieve, just because she had nothing interesting 
to do and he bored her with his interest in 
what he had to do, which was to follow the law. 
Some of the unhappiness of these three sis- 
ters, more than Mr. George admits, was due to 
that eternal disparity between the dream and 
the accomplishment which afflicts every hu- 
man being. But we must not quarrel with 
Mr. George. He has written an excellent 
novel, and one much more readable than the 
clever one he published last year, "The 
Making of an Englishman." He has done 
more. He has exhibited a kind of imagination 
which is too rare in English fiction, an imagi- 
nation that has enabled him to see (and to tell 
us) how it was with Grace. Because his inter- 
est is always in understanding her rather in 
moralizing about her he succeeds in arousing 
our sympathy for a woman who was unable to 
find any better use for her courage or any more 
complete expression for her adventurous spirit 
than a brief and secret love-affair. To do that 
is as much finer as it is more difficult than 
merely to play upon our sense of our own vir- 
tue by presenting us with a properly chastised 
sinner. 

Mr. Compton Mackenzie has rounded off 
what we had expected was to be a trilogy 
with his second volume. "Sinister Street" 
apparently tells all that we are to know of 
Michael Fane, whose acquaintance we made in 
"Youth's Encounter." Mr. Mackenzie asks, 
in an epilogue, that we regard his volumes as 
the story of "the youth of a man who pre- 
sumably will be a priest" rather than "as an 
idealized or debased presentation of his own 
existence up to the age of twenty- three. ' ' But 
we cannot freely grant his request, even 
though we do not know how much of an 
aesthete Mr. Mackenzie was when he was at 
Oxford. At any rate these two novels give a 
more complete account of the mind of a young 
man of our day than has been written pre- 
viously in English, an account which presents 
some of the things that Thackeray meant when 
he complained that his public would not per- 
mit him to tell all he wished about Pendennis, 
and a good many more besides. For Michael 
is of a kind of sensitiveness that would not 
have interested as full-blooded a man as the 
creator of Colonel Newcome, and Michael's 
experience with the Miss Fotheringay sort of 
person is very different from anything that 
was omitted by tacit request from Pendennis 's 
history. We mean to suggest that if ' ' Sinister 
Street" is worth reading, and we think it is, 
the fact is not wholly owing to its free use of 
material which, as Mr. Henry James has put 
it, the Victorian novelist "dodged." 



Perhaps there is no living writer who is 
more at home in the description of peasant and 
working-class life than Mr. Martin Andersen 
Nexo, or one of a finer spirit. There can 
hardly be one who is dead, because his point 
of view is too new. But we hesitate to men- 
tion socialism in connection with "Pelle the 
Conqueror," although it is mentioned once or 
twice in "Apprenticeship," because the word 
is so likely to call up memories of propagan- 
dist novels which had no merit except their 
intention to improve the world. Perhaps Mr. 
Nexo is not an orthodox socialist. One of the 
most illuminating and fascinating chapters in 
this second of the four volumes of Pelle 's his- 
tory tells of a vagabond workman, the most 
skilful of cobblers, who came back to the little 
shop where he was a legend and gave the others 
a glimpse of his romantic journey through 
the world, and of that vision which makes 
labor artistry. Would an orthodox socialist 
have put that passage in his novel? Doubt- 
less anybody would have put it there who 
could, and the point is that Mr. Nexo could. 
It may be that the half of the story which 
we have still to read, and which we know deals 
with Pelle 's experience as a labor-leader, will 
reveal the characteristic weakness of the propa- 
gandist, but we shall be surprised if it does. 
For so far Mr. Nexo seems always the artist, 
the man of feeling who is bound to give us 
what he has lived, and only what he has lived.

proper names force the reader to be on his 
guard. The author shows a commendable in- 
terest in contemporary documents, and adds 
to the published stock a number which he has 
encountered in several years of correspon- 
dence and travel, notably for the churches at 
New Haven. Other documents are repub- 
lished from parish histories and previous par- 
tial treatments, and much oral tradition is 
gathered up, relating both to the original struc- 
tures and to their transformations. The case 
of the church at Sag Harbor, built in 1843, of 
which the original builder was still alive in 
1912, shows the occasional possibilities in this 
direction. Too often, however, documentary 
evidence is not sought insistently enough or 
not even demanded; vague comparisons of 
unsupported assertions with estimates of 
probabilities take the place of methodical 
criticism. The section covering Trinity 
Church at Newport, "reported to have been 
built in 1726," is particularly flagrant in this 
regard. "Peter Harrison is reported to have 
been the architect of this building, but as 
Peter Harrison has also been given as the 
architect of King's Chapel, Boston, and other 
churches built toward the latter end of the 
eighteenth century, it seems improbable that 
he was designing at this early date, nor does 
the building itself bear any internal evidence 
of being his design." The importance of in- 
ternal evidence, of course, is very great, but 
such evidence should be verified, wherever 
possible, and relied on exclusively only when 
other testimony is found to be lacking. In 
the case in hand we know very well that Peter 
Harrison, whom Mr. Embury elsewhere de- 
scribes as an amateur, was our first trained 
architect, who came over with Dean Berkeley 
in 1729 and designed the Eedwood Library in 
Newport in 1748, a building which, like his 
other authenticated works, exhibits a schol- 
arly correctness of detail quite removed from 
the naivete of the church in question. In 
his concluding summary of development, as in 
some of the interpretations of single build- 
ings, the author is led astray by current 
misconceptions of architectural history and 
apparent lack of knowledge of earlier discus- 
sion. The renaissance of classic architecture 
in England had scarcely begun when the first 
Virginia colonists left the mother country, and 
it was the seventeenth century rather than the 
sixteenth in which English Gothic dragged out 
its moribund rural exile. The first London 
church with a colonnaded portico was St. 
Paul's, Covent Garden, built by Inigo Jones 
in 1631, so that it is small wonder that St. 
Luke's, Smithfield, Virginia, 1632, does not 
show more academic feeling. The statement 



that in New England the earliest church 
buildings resembled no English buildings at 
all, ignores their exact prototypes in the chap- 
els of English dissenters which Mr. Ronald P. 
Jones has recently described in his little book 
"Non-conformist Church Architecture." Mr. 
Embury's treatment of the Classical Revival,, 
especially, reflects the habitual lack of sympa- 
thy with this pervasive movement. The ques- 
tion is larger than personal predilection; it 
involves recognition of the historical bases of 
the neo-classic tendency and willingness to 
criticize its representatives by the canons of 
their own age. Only by such historical de- 
tachment can the superstition of a death of 
traditional art be replaced by a belief in its. 
unending vitality. 



Within the brief space of two- 

Autobiography n , TI/T- 

of a woman hundred and fiity pages, Miss 
Marie Sukloff, a Russian Jew- 
ess of twenty-nine years, has conveyed to En- 
glish and American readers in "The Life 
Story of a Russian Exile" (Century) an 
astonishing wealth of vivid information con- 
cerning Russian despotism and the efforts 
that are being made toward its overthrow. 
Miss Sukloif was born in a two-roomed hut 
one room devoted to the domestic animals 
in a village of thirty such huts. Inured from 
infancy to hardship, grinding poverty, and 
tyrannical oppression, she was apprenticed at 
the age of eleven, first to a woman grocer and 
then to a tailor. Even at that age the sor- 
rows of the peasants had entered into her 
soul. She had seen the fate of her aunt, out- 
raged and then beaten brutally and buried 
while still alive by the son of the neighboring 
country gentleman, and she had witnessed the 
continual desperate struggle of her own 
parents. Imbued with the new aspirations of 
the period, she joined in a strike and lost both 
her position as a tailor's apprentice and 
nearly a year's earnings, whereupon she im- 
mediately began devoting herself with youth- 
ful ardor to the propaganda of the Social 
Democrats. She was sent by her parents to 
Odessa to a poor uncle to secure employment, 
but became increasingly active as a revolu- 
tionist, and was selected to set up a secret 
printing press in Kiev, where she was arrested 
and thrown in prison. After more than two 
years in close confinement, she was exiled for 
life to eastern Siberia. From this remote re- 
gion, she escaped and brought back to Russia 
the baby of an exiled couple, thus avoiding 
recognition herself, and rendering the escape 
of the parents a future possibility. Embit- 
tered by her own sufferings and filled with 
pity for the oppressed people of her country,

she joined the headquarters of the Social 
Revolutionists at Geneva, and was appointed 
to assassinate several prominent and cruel 
officials, finally succeeding in killing with a 
bomb the terrible Governor Khvostoff. She 
was condemned to death, but was exiled in- 
stead to a distant region of Siberia. After 
suffering for some years physical and mental 
hardships which threatened to unsettle her 
reason, she finally escaped through a daring 
and brilliant strategem and with the faithful 
assistance of devoted fellow revolutionists 
outside the prison. This escape took place 
from the prison at Irkutsh, where Miss Suk- 
loff had been taken for an operation, the long 
deferment of which by the heartless neglect 
of the officials had almost caused her death. 
It was almost by miracle that she escaped the 
permanent ruin of her health by the terrible 
experiences through which she had to pass 
after getting outside the prison walls. She 
was never safe from reimprisonment until she 
sailed from Shanghai. The vivid descriptions 
of prison interiors and prison life in the many 
prisons occupied by the writer, the thrilling 
narrative of experiences and emotions, the 
portrayal of numerous officials and revolu- 
tionists from intimate knowledge render the 
book a human document of the highest value. 
It illuminates dark and dreary Siberia with 
a lurid brilliance. Scarcely conceivable are 
the cruelties and abominations so realistically 
reported that the reader cannot doubt their 
actuality. The book may well make one hold 
one's breath in suspense, as the primitive and 
cruel government it exposes hurls its myriads 
across the frontiers of Germany. But there 
is also another and very moving revelation in 
the little book. So spontaneous seem the 
many instances related of kindness, gener- 
osity, self-abnegation, and lofty heroism that 
one's admiration of the Russian people rises 
in proportion to the indignation aroused 
against the tyranny of the Russian govern- 
ment. The world has surely much to antici- 
pate from the long deferred liberation of the 
Russians, and among these people none will 
give a finer account of themselves than the 
Jews, if we may judge from the gifts and the 
spirit of such Jewish women writers as Marie 
Sukloff and Mary Antin. 



The promise of Mr. Bertrand Russell has pub- 
RusKpht lished Iris Lowell Lectures of 
losophy. 1914 in book form under the 

title of "Scientific Method in Philosophy" 
( Open Court Publishing Co. ) . He begins with 
the statement that little progress has been 
hitherto discernible in philosophic specula- 
tion. Philosophy has made larger claims and 



achieved fewer results than any other branch 
of learning. The great systems of the past are 
of no vital concern to us. They are interesting 
only as hypotheses, as aids to the imagination. 
Mr. Russell then surveys the field of present- 
day thought and discusses three chief tenden- 
cies. There is first of all the classical tradition 
which descends in the main from Kant and 
Hegel. Though still well entrenched academ- 
ically, this represents on the whole a decaying 
force. It is based on the omnipotence of rea- 
soning. Its world is constructed by logic with 
little appeal to concrete experience. Then 
there is, in the second place, evolutionism, still 
associated with the name of Herbert Spencer, 
who in turn derives from the earlier English 
empiricists. Its modern representatives are 
Nietzsche, William James, and M. Bergson. 
This philosophy, which is based on biology, 
has a predominant interest in the question of 
the destiny of life. But philosophy, if it is to 
be a genuine study, must have a province of 
its own and aim at results which the other 
sciences can neither prove nor disprove. In- 
tuition, insight, mysticism may carry convic- 
tion to the favored recipient, but, untested and 
unsupported, they cannot constitute a suffi- 
cient guarantee of truth. The third tendency 
is the one which the author himself favors and 
to which he has given the somewhat unpre- 
possessing name of "logical atomism." This 
has gradually crept into philosophy through 
the critical scrutiny of mathematics. It is 
akin to the "new realism" which has recently 
been developed at Harvard and other Amer- 
ican universities. It represents the substitu- 
tion of piecemeal, detailed, and verifiable re- 
sults for large untested generalities. The true 
function of the mathematical logic which it 
employs is analytic rather than constructive. 
It shows the possibility of hitherto unsus- 
pected alternatives. It liberates the imagina- 
tion as to what the world may be while refus- 
ing to dogmatize on what it is. Mr. Russell's 
chapter on the positive theory of infinity 
shows the indebtedness of his method to the 
mathematical investigations of two of the Ger- 
mans, Frege and Cantor, and of the English 
scholar, Dr. Whitehead. Such apparent para- 
doxes as that an infinite number cannot be 
increased by adding to it are made plausible 
to the layman by a non-technical demonstra- 
tion. The last chapter is on the notion of 
cause, with application to the question of free- 
will. The author finds that freedom, in any 
valuable sense, demands only that our voli- 
tions shall be the result of our own desires and 
not of an outside force. Thus philosophy, in 
the author's opinion, is becoming scientific 
through the simultaneous acquisition of new

facts and logical methods. It has suffered 
much in the past from lack of modesty in 
wanting to attack the larger problems at once. 
But now it is ready to abandon all claims to 
gratify mundane desires. It does not even 
presume to prophesy about the future of the 
universe. This unpretentiousness is achieving 
its reward. The new method has already been 
successful in such time-honored problems as 
number, infinity, continuity, space, and time. 
It may be counted upon to proceed slowly from 
success to success. Mr. Russell is one of the 
many English academic writers who possess 
an- enviable gift of expression. The lucidity, 
precision, and elegance of his style are so 
compelling that even the unphilosophically 
minded will find no stumbling blocks in his 
exposition. __ 

Dr. Arthur "Wentworth Hamil- 
ton Eaton's interest in the na- 

n .-, 

tive Tories of the American 
Revolution has rendered him well fitted for 
the preparation of "The Famous Mather 
Byles" (Boston: W. A. Butterfield). Dr. 
Byles's relationships with the Mathers, his 
alliance by marriage with several of the patri- 
cian families of New England, his long pas- 
torate of a fashionable Boston church, his 
far-famed wit, and his persistent Toryism, with 
the resulting loneliness and privation of his 
old age, all help to make him a picturesque 
character. His tradition is of the sort that is 
likely to grow by accretion, and particularly 
is this true of the stories of his wit. It is 
hard to believe that the man who was capable 
of some of the best things that have been 
ascribed to him could be guilty of some of the 
worst. Dr. Eaton repeats .all the usual anec- 
dotes, generally without citing authorities, 
and, one is tempted to feel, without careful 
winnowing. In other biographical matters he 
has been thorough and apparently exact. He 
outlines the early history of the Byles family 
in America; he cites the will in which In- 
crease Mather bequeathed to his grandson, 
Mather Byles, his wearing apparel, excepting 
his chamber cloak, and, on condition that the 
legatee entered the ministry, one-fourth of 
his library; and he has unearthed the record 
of an interesting squabble between young 
Byles and James Franklin of the New En- 
gland "Courant." He traces in some detail 
Dr. Byles's long career as pastor of the Hollis 
Street Church one of the many careers that 
remind us how much social position and fam- 
ily connections signified in the early life of 
supposedly democratic Boston. After the 
Doctor openly espoused the loyalist cause the 
voices that speak of him are mostly hostile, 



and although the biographer has given to 
these only their due weight the record of the 
later years is necessarily a trifle unsatisfac- 
tory. It is notable that Dr. Eaton remarks, 
without mentioning his authorities, that 
Joseph Green, the Boston humorist and dis- 
tiller who parodied some of Dr. Byles's 
poems, "had none too amiable a feeling" 
toward the Doctor. It has usually been sup- 
posed that the two men, who were fellow- 
students at Harvard, fellow-contributors to a 
collection of poems, and later fellow-loyalists, 
were perfectly friendly in their combats of 
wit. The author has a fondness for odd col- 
locations of words, such as "It is not to any 
one difficult in these days to see why," but 
aside from frequent sentences of this sort the 
book reads pleasantly. It contains a number 
of interesting portraits, a bibliography of Dr. 
Byles's principal works, and copious notes, 
though these last are sometimes silent just 
where a citation of authority is most to be 
desired. 



The music 
of Russia. 



No one who wishes to under- 
stand Russian music will fail to 
familiarize himself with the 
writings of Mrs. Rosa Newmarch. Her book 
on Borodin and Liszt, her monograph on 
Tschaikowsky, and the volume here reviewed 
on the Russian opera all demand attention be- 
cause ,of her intimate acquaintance with the 
land, the people, and the literature of Russia, 
as well as because of her critical knowledge of 
the music of Russian composers. Her book 
on "Poetry and Progress in Russia" should 
be mentioned in this connection because in 
Russia the musician has worked side by side 
with the poet, and the advancement of the 
fatherland has been an interest dear to both. 
In "Russian Opera" (Dutton) Mrs. New- 
march covers the whole field of operatic his- 
tory in that singular and somewhat myste- 
rious country. A great part of this account, 
especially that of the earlier periods, has 
merely an historical interest. The Russian 
opera became important only in the nine- 
teenth century. It was then that the great 
composers appeared, that the great operas 
were written, that the peculiarly national 
character of Russian music was made mani- 
fest, and that the strength and weakness of 
Russian music became known to the musical 
world in the work of such cosmopolitan 
musicians as Rubenstein and Tschaikowsky, 
and of such nationalistic composers as the 
"Invincible Band," or "The Mighty Five" 
(Balakirev, Moussorgsky, Rimsky-Rorsakov, 
Borodin, and Cesar Cui). We find the two 
great critics, Serov and Stassov, obscuring as

well as illuminating musical controversies. We 
are introduced to the somewhat antagonistic 
musical circles of Balakirev and Balaiev. We 
learn of the production of the operas that 
make Russian music perhaps the most con- 
spicuous body of purely national music in 
existence. Mrs. Newmarch has lived in Rus- 
sia, has met the principal protagonists in this 
drama, has sympathized with their efforts and 
intentions, has throughout been on the patri- 
otic side of controversies, and yet has main- 
tained a judicial attitude toward everything. 
Her book is therefore authoritative and con- 
vincing in its utterances. Perhaps she makes 
too much of the national aspects of this music 
and does not emphasize sufficiently the lim- 
itations of all merely national music, but the 
value of her criticisms and interpretations is 
not thereby seriously impaired and her view 
of the movement as a whole does not disregard 
the region where the national shows its rela- 
tions to the substantially human and univer- 
sal. The book is provided with portraits, as 
well as a number of other illustrations, and 
the index is satisfactory. Treating, as it does, 
of a subject which has by no means had the 
consideration that belongs to it, the book be- 
longs in every musical library. 



Mrs.pnkhurst', This breathing spell in the 
apologia pro woman suffrage agitation in 
England is a good time to re- 
view what that agitation has effected and to 
consider briefly its hopes for the future. 
Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst's book, "My Own 
Story" (Hearst's), gives an excellent even 
though warmly partisan account of the move- 
ment, especially of that part in which she has 
been concerned, and closes with hopeful 
prophecies of the future. Addressing herself 
to American readers and appealing for their 
sympathies, she writes with a very telling 
directness of speech about the attitude and 
methods of the English government in seek- 
ing to withhold from women the rights to 
which it will be difficult for any candid 
reader of her book to maintain that they have 
no just claim. Even of the violent means for 
obtaining them which she so notably advo- 
cates, she makes not a bad defence if 
violence is ever defensible. Certainly as mate- 
rial for a book, her stormy experiences of the 
last few years are rich in incidents of an 
unusual and not seldom a startling nature. 
And all this vehemence and hardihood, so lit- 
tle in harmony with accepted traditions of 
what is most excellent in woman and most 
truly characteristic of her, we find to be mani- 
fested not by one disappointed in early hopes 
of domestic happiness, soured by the repulse 



of her affection, denied the privilege of moth- 
erhood, but by a woman gently nurtured in a 
happy home, wedded in young womanhood to 
the man of her choice, with whom she enjoyed 
nineteen years of sympathetic and loving com- 
panionship, and to whom, as she relates, she 
bore five children. A most interesting and 
gifted personality is this that is presented so 
frankly in "My Own Story," and at the same 
time the book is a clear and readable account 
of an important movement in English public 
life by the person most ardently devoted to 
the success of that movement. In closing her 
last chapter she feels encouraged to hope that 
further militancy on the part of women will 
be unnecessary, that past governmental mis- 
takes in the treatment of woman suffragists 
will not be repeated, and that it will be recog- 
nized how impossible is the task of "crushing 
or even delaying the march of women towards 
their rightful heritage of political liberty and 
social and industrial freedom." The book is 
well illustrated, even to the point of including 
certain views of its writer in situations not 
exactly enhancing her dignity.

in his book thus entitled, does 
not mean collections of bibles, or libraries 
mentioned in the Bible, but book-collections 
worthy of the name of library "in Biblical

the snakes of Ireland, they were, he believes, 
very numerous "thousands or even tens of 
thousands, containing millions of written 
books or documents." As in his immediately 
preceding book, "The Beginnings of Libra- 
ries," the author gives to the name "library," 
perhaps wisely, a more inclusive meaning 
than, for example, the Assyriologists might 
be inclined to allow. "Archives" might well 
enough be the term used by them instead of 
"libraries," he admits, if they were writing 
only for one another; "but their case is a 
little different in this matter from the case of

raphers?], for the books of these men, unlike 
those of metaphysicians and mathematicians, 
are keenly desired to be read by ordinary mor- 
tals, the field is one of general interest and the 
works of these men the very best work done in 
the field." This keen desire on the part of 
ordinary mortals to read the writings of 
Assyriologists has not before been generally 
noted; its existence is a hopeful sign in the 
world of letters. Mr. Richardson's diligence 
has gathered material from the works of 
archaeologists, epigraphists, Egyptologists, and 
others, to fill a book of more than two hundred

pages, and a score and a half of helpful illus- 
trations are interspersed. The work is well 
done, and one is the more willing to commend 
it because of the author's modest preliminary 
remark concerning his necessarily somewhat 
desultory chapters, that "such value as they 
have lies chiefly in the fact that those who 
could do the work better do not do it at all. ' ' 
As is already known to many, Dr. Richard- 
son is librarian of Princeton University ; and 
so it naturally follows that the Princeton 
University Press issues his book. 



Paris in time 
of anarchy. 



Such scenes of tumult as may 
possibly be repeated before long 
in one or more of the capitals of 
Europe are stirringly presented by Mr. 
Ernest Alfred Vizetelly in "My Adventures 
in the Commune" (Duffield). At the close of 
the siege of Paris, he returned with his father 
and brother to the harassed and disorganized 
city, and the three were present during the 
weeks of turbulence that followed. Both 
things actually seen and things learned on 
good authority are recounted by this expe- 
rienced chronicler of rather exciting personal 
adventure. Among other excesses of the 
Communists he witnessed,, for example, the 
burning of the guillotine in what is now the 
Place Voltaire, and the conflagrations, as he 
calls them, of the Prefecture of Police and 
the Palais de Justice. Indeed, he gave some 
hours to pumping and to the passing of buck- 
ets at the latter fire. He also remembers 
listening to a public speech from Louise 
Michel, the so-called Red Virgin of the Com- 
mune. These and numerous other personal 
touches give life to his detailed account of 
Parisian events in these memorable months. 
Narrow escapes, too, from personal injury or 
even death are not wanting, as where he de- 
scribes his casual conversation with a plumber 
near the Gare Saint-Lazare, and its abrupt 
termination by the entrance of a bullet into 
the workman's temple and the whistling of 
others in the immediate vicinity. The duties 
of a journalist seem to have made necessary 
the author's exposure of himself to the perils 
of the time and place, and to this necessity 
the book is indebted for much of its stirring 
quality. In one sense a sequel to the same 
writer's earlier volume, "My Days of Adven- 
ture," which tells the story of the famous 
siege, the work is nevertheless well able to 
stand on its own merits and can be read with 
entire satisfaction independently of that pre- 
vious narrative. Many illustrations from'* 
contemporary prints and photographs enliven 
its pages. 



The teacher of ^ n Oberlehrer is a teacher in a 
the German German secondary school, that 

secondary school. ^ ^ & claflsical "gy mna sium," 

or its modern scientific equivalent. The evo- 
lution of this class of German school-master 
is traced in concise, clear outlines by Dr. W. 
S. Learned of the Carnegie Foundation for 
the Advancement of Teaching (Harvard 
University Press). The book is based to a 
great extent on the late Professor Paulsen's 
"Geschichte des gelehrten Unterrichts. " 
The author shows how the Oberlehrer was but 
a functionary of the church until the latter 
part of the eighteenth century, and how since 
his emancipation from ecclesiastical control he 
has gradually developed collective conscious- 
ness until his profession now ranks in dig- 
nity and importance, if not in emoluments, 
with the higher branches of law and medi- 
cine. The changes in educational outlook are 
also fully discussed, more especially the 
broadening curriculum of the last several 
decades since the monopoly of the classics 
was broken. Dr. Learned has a vision of the 
time when American teachers shall be even 
more rigorously selected, more amply and 
purposefully trained than are our lawyers 
and doctors. He finds in German educational 
conditions many features which we may 
profitably imitate. America, he believes, is 
greatly inferior in basal education and speci- 
fic training. Our teachers are more loosely 
organized and are too prone to regard their 
occupation as a stepping-stone to other 
things. But with German solidarity goes 
much deadening routine. The freedom, 
initiative, and responsibility which the Amer- 
ican teachers possess constitute a . priceless 
asset. The author believes further that the 
segregation of the sexes in the German schools 
has been carried too far, though he admits 
that the elementary schools in America have 
been excessively feminized. 



The education 
of girls. 



A more accurate title for Pro- 
fessor William A. McKeever's 
"The Industrial Training of 
the Girl" (Macmillan) would be "Training 
the Girl for the Home." The author ignores 
all other types of industry in which the girl 
might engage, and devotes his attention al- 
most wholly to the training of the girl for 
domestic occupations. The most remarkable 
characteristic of the book is the author's 
unqualified faith in the happy results which 
he believes will follow the adoption of his 
rather general programme for the instruction 
of the girl. Take, for instance, the optimistic 
statement: "Plain cooking, plain sewing, 
plain serving, and plain every-day living

once the ordinary girl has had her life well- 
defined and grounded in the principles of 
these common things, she has certainly made 
all the necessary beginnings of a beautiful 
and happy career." Again, in another chap- 
ter, he suggests a plan whereby the teacher 
would grade the girl in her monthly report on 
all the ordinary subjects taught in the school, 
and the parent in the same report would 
grade her on washing dishes, sweeping and 
dusting, preparing meals, darning and mend- 
ing, plain sewing, tending the baby, etc. 
Leaving aside the question of the practica- 
bility of such a plan, it is doubtful whether 
the results would justify the author's enthu- 
siastic statement that "Thus the personality 
of the ordinary young woman of the future 
will have been made rich and deep in sym- 
pathy and service, full and strong in force 
and magnanimity, serene and poised through 
the inclusion of the higher things of the 
spirit." 

BRIEFER MENTION. 

Uniform in size with Mr. Sonnenschein's " The 
Best Books " and Dr. Ernest A. Baker's " Guide 
to the Best Fiction in English " is the stout volume, 
"A Concordance to the Poetical and Dramatic 
Works of Alfred, Lord Tennyson" (Macmillan), 
compiled by Mr. Arthur E. Baker, F.R.Hist.8. 
About 150,000 quotations and references are given, 
alphabetized on the keyword and classified accord- 
ing to its context or grammatical function. That 
the list of omitted words (words for which no 
quotation is furnished) includes less than two hun- 
dred fifty entries, in itself bespeaks the compre- 
hensiveness of the compiler's plan. Over eight 
years ago Mr. Baker, then in touch with public 
library activities in the north of England, felt the 
need of a reference work like this, and started the 
task of compilation which, completed after years 
of fruitful industry, will be of great value to the 
librarian, the student of English literature, and the 
public speaker. 

Most of Miss Helen Dawes Brown's little book, 
"Talks to Freshman Girls" (Houghton), is com- 
posed of advice and suggestions about the very 
things that are emphasized especially in the talks 
of deans and instructors to girls in their first year 
in college the art of reading, the use of the pen, 
and studies " for delight, for ornament, and for 
ability." Such advice, when as well expressed as it 
is in these .. brief essays, serves for momentary 
inspiration to the college girl, but it does not really 
get at the heart of the most pressing problems of 
her freshman year. At the end of the book, how- 
ever, in her last and shortest chapter, which she 
entitles " Everyday Living," the author touches 
briefly upon some topics that really come home to 
the girl in a vital way. An entire volume in which 
each one of these questions could be elaborated 
and thoroughly discussed would probably prove of 
much more practical and lasting value to the col- 
lege girl than the present book. 



A translation of M. Arzibashef's notorious novel, 
" Sanine," is announced by Mr. B. W. Huebsch. 

The good news comes from London that Profes- 
sor Gilbert Murray will soon be ready to publish 
his translation of Euripides's "Alcestis." 

" Memories of Forty Years " by the Princess 
Catherine Radziwill is announced for immediate

poems by Mrs. Browning not hitherto published 
will be included in a volume to be published next 
week by the Macmillan Co. under the title of 
" New Poems." 

Mr. H. G. Wells's novel, "Bealby," which ran 
serially in " Collier's Weekly." is announced for 
early publication by the Macmillan Co. Among 
other novels which this house will bring out shortly 
are Mr. Winston Churchill's "A Far Country " and 
Mr. St. John G. Ervine's " Mrs. Martin's Man." 

"Possession," a fourth volume of Mr. George 
Middleton's plays, is announced for publication in 
February by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. This house 
will also bring out Miss Constance D'Arcy Mack- 
ay's book " How to Produce Plays for Children " 
and Miss Maud Frank's " Short Plays about 
Famous Authors." 

The first volume of the " Graphic Art Series " 
edited by Mr. Joseph Pennell, which Mr. Fisher 
Unwin has announced in London, is to be " Lithog- 
raphy and Lithographers: Some Chapters on the 
History of the Art," by Mrs. Elizabeth Robins Pen- 
nell. The second volume, " Etching," will be writ- 
ten by Mr. Pennell. 

Mr. Gilbert K. Chesterton's novel, " The Wisdom 
of Father Brown," will be published this month by 
Messrs. John Lane Co. simultaneously with Mr. 
Horace W. C. Newte's "A Pillar of Salt" and 
Miss Alice Birkhead's "Gabrielle." Later this com- 
pany will publish Miss Anne Warwick's story 
" The Chalk Line " and a new novel by Mr. Ford 
Madox Hueffer.

COMPLETE REVIEWS OF 
THREE NEW BOOKS 




WORTHY OF SPECIAL 
ATTENTION 



THE ROSIE WORLD 

By Parker Fillmore 

Illustrated, $1.30 net 

(from The New York Evening Post) 

Many of the chapters 9f this book have appeared as 
short stories in various periodicals, but one who has read them 
piecemeal and enjoyed their rich humor and keen insight into 
human nature will be glad to read them all again, linked up as 
they are in the book. The amazing thing is how a mere_ man 
can so understand the vagaries of several kinds of femininity, 
from forty-or-so-year-old Maggie O'Brien down to little 
Geraldine, in the throes of teething during the mid-summer 
heat of New York. At least, if he does not really understand, 
in his own mind, he gives such a good imitation of it that 
most women who read will have a little prick of self-con- 
sciousness behind their smiles. Rosie herself is one of the 
sweetest creations in present-day fiction. She has no more sense 
of humor then John Shand himself, but when one has not a 
tear in the eye over her bigheartedness, her earnestness in 
doing what she believes to be her duty, he has tears in both 
eyes over the Irish humor of the situations that her earnest- 
ness and lack of humor so often call out. To one who enjoys 
genuine humor, without a hint of coarseness, who prefers little 
pictures from life that leave a good taste in the mouth, and who 
appreciates the setting forth of such pictures in good English, 
this collection will be distinctly welcome. 



BELSHAZZAR COURT 

Or Village Life in New York City 

By Simeon Strunsky 

$1.25 net 

(From The Nation) 

With a typically incongruous turn, Simeon Strunsky 
entitles his latest volume "Belshazzar Court, or Village Life 
in New York City" (Holt; $1.25 net). Readers of the Atlantic 
Monthly will recognize most of these "field notes" on the 
New Yorker in his apartment house or on the street, in the 
theatre or at the baseball park.' To the cosmopolitan these 
covertly serious essays will present a humorous picture of 
life as it is endured in Manhattan. To the Gothamite they 
will seem a brilliant review of familiar but unregarded phases 
of his own existence. For they are indeed packed with shrewd, 
often penetrating, observation of public manners and homely 
customs. Most readers may be more taken with the writer's 
fresh, quaint, witty, or hyperbolical way of putting things, 
since he has made his chief bid for popularity as a humorist. 
He has, to be sure, a sharp eye for the inconsistencies and 
insincerities of both our conduct and our ideals, and it must 
be conceded that there is seldom a dull page in all his wander- 
ing remarks. But his pleasantry is not the jolly English 
humor_of eccentricity, with laughter holding both his sides, 
nor is it the hearty American humor of exaggeration, artfully 
leading up to some surprising or grotesque conclusion. It 
is an intellectual humor that plays around ideas, finding an 
unexpected truth in apparent absurdity. In all likelihood, 
therefore, the discriminating conner of Mr. Strunsky's para- 
graphs will set greatest store by the restless light of reason 
that flashes upon or lingers about every topic considered. 
By Matthew Arnold his lucubrations would surely be pro- 
nounced literature, for the criticism of life is always just 
beneath the rippling, eddying surface of the style. His is 
far from being the easy paradoxical scintillation of the social 
revolutionist. On the contrary, the author plays the doubting 
Thomas with regard to most of the educational, theatrical, 
and other fads with which our progressive age is rife. He even 
complacently pokes fun at Bernard Shaw with roguish incon- 
sistency, seeing that in his own volume the pages have to be 
cut at the bottom. In fine, the rare quality of the book is 
not so much the humor as the suggestive quality of the thought. 



PELLE THE CONQUEROR 

Boyhood, Apprenticeship 

By Martin Andersen Nexo 

$1.40 net, each volume 
(From The New Republic) 

A Danish Epic 

From the moment when the Swedish boat lands little 
Pelle and his old father Lasse on the shores of _ the island 
of Bornholm, our imaginations are caught in this northern 
world which, strange as it is in its primitive simplicity, is 
yet made glowingly real by the sympathy of genius. Few 
foreign stories place you more seductively in the very heart 
of the life they depict than this epic of a workingman's life 
in modern Denmark. Only a rare spiritual fidelity to per- 
sonal experience could produce the color and movement and 
wisdom and good will of this story. We are told that the 
author was himself a shoemaker's apprentice in the Baltic 
island, and then, like Pelle, was sucked away into the many- 
towered capital. Here he worked as a bricklayer until 
he was rescued by one of the "people's high schools," those 
wonderful Danish popular universities scattered about the 
land, where farmers and bricklayers, kitchen-maids and 
clerks, come to spend a few arduous and fascinated months 
of their lives in the study oh, these sober northern people! 
of history and literature. This education permitted him to 
become a teacher, then the author of short stories and a book 
of reminiscences of a bright Spanish trip, and now there 
comes from him this four-volume story of his own life or 
the lives of such as he, the first volume of which, appearing 
in 1906, has already become almost a Danish classic. 

The two volumes which have been translated into En- 
glish take Pelle to the time when he leaves his island to seek 
nis fortune in Copenhagen. The life of the boy and his simple, 
patient old father as farm laborers at Stone Farm, with its 
background of wind-swept heath and the distant sea; the rough, 
jovial society of milkmaids and stablemen, with the fierce 
irascibilty of these little-tamed Norsemen; the holidays and 
the drunkenness and the lovemaking; the mystery of the old 
farmhouse with its kind, sensual master and the woe of the 
jealous mistress; the grim old Protestant superstitions of _the 
community; the life of the small farmers lived so hardily against 
a cold and niggardly nature; the reiterated themes of peasant 
life, the wresting of a homestead from the moor, the seductions, 
the fatalistic waiting of the old people for death; all this, 
seen through the aimless play and riotous imagination of 
childhood, makes "Boyhood" a book of such charm that one 
scarcely knows whether to admire it most for its poetry or its 
realism, its imaginative power or its loyalty to life.

THE YELLOW BOOK." 



The notion that the years from 1891 to 1898 
were a period of decadence in English letters 
is already a legend. The London c ' Times ' ' hit 
it off very well when it called them "the yel- 
low nineties. " It is a new word, in its present 
sense, is it not ? Perhaps it goes back farther 
than 1891, but we doubt it. Whistler made 
the color fashionable about that time, and pos- 
sibly it came to have a vague connection in the 
mind of the day with his personality, so vivid, 
so contemptuous, and so little understood. It 
is the fate of all such spirits, careless of the 
morality of security and ruthless in the prac- 
tice of that virtue of which mediocrity is inno- 
cent, to be regarded by their contemporaries as 
strange, then morbid, and, finally, wicked. 
But Whistler's fondness for yellow probably 
did little more than to suggest by indirection 
the title of "The Yellow Book." Nothing 
more was required to give a name to the lit- 
erary and artistic character of the decade. 
The adjective has come to describe irresponsi- 
ble sensationalism in the newspapers. But it 
calls up very readily sensationalism in art; 
and "The Yellow Book" seems likely to be 
remembered as an epitome of the exotic, the 
bizarre, the wicked, of "art for art's sake," 
and the fin de siecle. 

A certain humor, bitter enough to those who 
care passionately about the art of literature 
but not unpleasant to the ironic spirit, attaches 
to the legend of ' ' The Yellow Book. ' ' For the 
thirteen volumes of that quarterly still exist 
and may be compared with the fable that has 
grown up about them. 

The first number, that of April, 1894, led off 
with a design by Sir Frederick Leighton, than 
whom there was no more respectable artist liv- 
ing. This page was immediately followed by 
a story, "The Death of the Lion," by Mr. 
Henry James, who had not then written 
' ' What Maisie Knew. ' ' One of the poems was 
by Mr. A. C. Benson and one of the essays by 
Mr. Edmund Gosse. An article by Arthur 
Waugh on "Reticence in Literature" de- 
fended, though rather on behalf of art than 
on behalf of morality, the Victorian tradition

as to the representation of passion in fiction 
and poetry. Was it then so very devilish ? 

Philip Gilbert Hamerton, who will be re- 
membered by some readers as the author of 
"The Intellectual Life" and by others along 
with Harry Quilter as the victim of Whistler 
but by no one as anything but representative 
of Victorian appreciation in art and litera- 
ture, did not think so. He was invited by 
Henry Harland, who must have been almost 
as astute as some contemporary magazine edi- 
tors, to write for the second volume of "The 
Yellow Book" a review of the first. He found 
two contributors whom we have not so far 
mentioned, Aubrey Beardsley and Mr. Arthur 
Symons, to complain of. He recognized 
Beardsley 's quality, while objecting to his 
morbidity. He resented Mr. Symons 's poem, 
"Stella Maris," observing that it was of the 
fashion set by Eossetti's "Jenny." And he 
thought badly of an editor who permitted a 
defence of reticence to contain, even as an 
example of what should be avoided, three 
stanzas of Swinburne's "Dolores." But Mr. 
Hamerton concluded his criticism with this 
sentence : 

" On the whole, the literature in the first number 
of ' The Yellow Book ' is adequately representa- 
tive of the modern English literary mind, both in 
the observation of reality and in style." 

Of the illustrations he wrote : 

" On the whole, these illustrations decidedly pre- 
suppose real artistic culture in the public. They 
do not condescend in any way to what might be 
guessed at as the popular taste." 

In the three years that followed, "The 
Yellow Book" was never more shocking than 
in that first number. A contemporary reader 
is struck, in looking through "The Yellow 
Book," with the number of serious and re- 
spectable names in the tables of contents. 
Mr. Enoch Arnold Bennett and Mr. H. G. 
Wells are there, as well as Mr. James. Mr. 
Harland was himself a frequent contributor. 
So was Ella D'Arcy. There is even an essay 
on Stendhal of all subjects by our own 
Mr. Norman Hapgood. 

Is not the legend of the yellow "Yellow 
Book" a little absurd? 

Perhaps there is more reason in it than 
appears. The Victorian spirit may have been 
as commonplace as the artistic spirit imagines 
it to have been; but it was not blind to its 
enemies. It saw Beardsley in "The Yellow 
Book" and sensed, if it did not know, that Sir 



Frederick Leighton was no match for him. It 
saw very little of Mr. Symons 's verse. But it 
may very well have felt the man behind that 
little, the man who was so fundamentally 
opposed in his view of art and letters to all 
that, in the cliche of our own day, was "sane." 
What it sensed or felt we have recorded for us 
in the meaning which attaches to "yellow." 
It did not matter that Symons and Beardsley 
left "The Yellow Book" in order to create, in 
"The Savoy," a more genuine magazine. 
Their names and their view were first asso- 
ciated with the earlier publication ; or, rather, 
the earlier publication was first associated with 
their names and their view. It did not matter 
that Oscar Wilde never contributed to either 
magazine. The smash-up of his career as a 
personality was widely regarded as proof that 
the influence of "The Yellow Book" on litera- 
ture was evil. 

The irony, of course, is not so much that 
everybody who cared for beauty and truth in 
art should have suffered for the scandal which 
swallowed Oscar Wilde. Anything else would 
be too much to expect. The irony is to be 
found rather in the predicament of criticism. 
Whistler thought criticism was merely stupid. 
It has sometimes been worse ; it has sometimes 
been cowardly. Criticism was intelligent 
enough to know that the men of the nineties 
had done work that was fine and strong. It 
knew that, after all, the immortal music of 
"Non sum qualis eram bonae sub regno 
Cynarae ' ' was infinitely more important in the 
consideration of Ernest Dowson than the 
morality of his way of life. It knew that 
Beardsley 's mastery of design was the signifi- 
cant thing and the pre-occupation which was 
revealed in his romance ' ' Under the Hill ' ' the 
insignificant thing. It knew how much more 
important it is to literature that Oscar Wilde 
wrote "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" than 
that he should have been put in prison. But 
criticism had not the courage of its knowledge. 
Compelled, on the whole, to sympathize with 
the art of these men and those whose names 
are associated with theirs, it has paid its re- 
spects to public opinion by emphasizing always 
their physical and moral weakness and never 
their artistic strength. 

If we were all so moral that we were always 
ready to recognize that which is moral and to 
flee from that which is of ill-repute, we should 
have created a very different legend about 
"The Yellow Book." It is all very well to

draw away from men who seem to have little 
responsibility in their personal relations. But 
it is not good to be blind to a supreme virtue. 
And there is no denying that men like Beards- 
ley and Dowson had a supreme virtue. 

If they were not true to everything to which 
we demand allegiance they were true to the 
best thing in them. It is no piece of rhetoric 
that furnishes the refrain to Dowson 's poem: 

" I have been faithful to thee, Cynara, in my 
fashion." 

It is the precise truth. He was faithful to an 
ideal of art. And so was Beardsley. They 
literally died for it. 



TEE POETS OF BELGIUM. 

Belgium, though lately she has lain crushed 
and bleeding under the heel of a ruthless 
invader, has nevertheless won for herself a 
proud position among the peoples of Europe. 
She has justified her intense nationalism ; she 
has vindicated her claim to live her own life ; 
she has carried into the battle-field the ardor 
and intelligent energy that had already 
brought her to the forefront of literary na- 
tions. It is no new thing to find a great 
literary renaissance coincident with other 
more material manifestations of national 
spirit; and the Belgium that delayed the 
progress of the most powerful army in the 
world is the Belgium that had already given 
us Maeterlinck, Verhaeren, Rodenbach, Fon- 
tainas, Elskamp, and Mockel. 

Since the death of Ibsen and Tolstoi there 
can be little question that the foremost lit- 
erary reputation of to-day is that of M. Mau- 
rice Maeterlinck; his work has made a 
profound impression on the reading public of 
Europe and America. But though M. Maeter- 
linck has achieved the wider popularity, his 
fame must not blind us to others of the small 
nation that gave him birth. This little coun- 
try has been like a nest of singing-birds. The 
song of many may not have been strong 
enough to pierce to the outside world; but 
we have to remember that it takes much to 
break through the barriers of a foreign 
tongue, and that poetry in special suffers 
from difficulties of translation. Belgian poets 
also have often been taken to be Frenchmen 
by casual readers, because for the most part 
French in their literary language: so that 
against the advantage of gaining an im- 
mensely widened audience has to be set the 
disadvantage of some veiling of their nation- 
ality. It is true that some of them could have 
written equally well in Flemish M. Maeter- 
linck for instance, who is a pure Fleming; 



and a limited number have done so. But 
Flemish is simply a variant of Low-German 
or Dutch, and it offers no compensating bene- 
fits to counterbalance its narrowing of the 
audience. In spite of their writing in French, 
which is at least as much their native tongue 
as English is the native tongue of an Irish- 
man, M. Maeterlinck and M. Verhaeren may 
be claimed as entirely for Belgium as Shakes- 
peare for England, Goethe for Germany, or 
Dostoieffsky for Russia. 

M. Verhaeren has used the phrase les 
forces tumultueuses, and these are the best 
words to describe the vitality of modern Bel- 
gium. The country has been seething with 
tumultuous forces, intellectual unrest, vigor- 
ous animal spirits, pulsing life. Borrowing 
something of impulse and inspiration from its 
two great neighbors, France and Germany, 
something also from its own Flemish tradi- 
tions and from Holland, Belgian life has had 
the abundant virility so often found in things 
largely hybrid. "In no other part of Eu- 
rope," says Herr Zweig, "is life lived with 
such intensity, such gaiety. In no other coun- 
try as in Flanders is excess in sensuality and 
pleasure a function of strength." But the 
sensuality, if we must use that word, has not 
been neurotic or morbid; clearly it has not 
sapped the vigor of the people late events 
have shown them robust, heroic, strong. It is 
about thirty years since the literary new- 
birth of the people began, its centre of origin 
being the now devastated University of Lou- 
vain. It began in a spirit of licence and re- 
volt, of rebellion against authority in most 
things, not easily to be crushed by the forces 
of inertia and convention. Journals were 
started, such as "La Semaine" and "Le 
Type," only to be suppressed; and little vol- 
umes of verse began to appear, suggesting the 
influences of Verlaine and Baudelaire, and 
suggesting also that there were new voices 
quite able to speak for themselves. . 

The finest of these voices, undoubtedly, was 
that of M. Emile Verhaeren, who has lately, 
in French and British periodicals, been pour- 
ing forth the fierce anguish of his outraged 
patriotism. He was born almost sixty years 
since at St. Amand, a village in the centre of 
the recent war-district. Like M. Maeterlinck 
and Rodenbach, he was educated at the Jesuit 
college of Sainte-Barbe in Ghent. "We have 
the local scenery of his boyhood, its broad 
levels and fine atmospheric effects, its peasan- 
try, everywhere pervading his poetry. Later 
he studied law at Louvain, and had a share 
in publishing the aggressive little weekly ' ' La 
Semaine." A brief attempt at legal practice 
convinced him that literature, not law, was 



70

[ Feb. 1 



his true mistress; and he threw himself into 
his vocation with passionate and brave ardor. 
Both plastic art and music had a powerful 
share in forming him. It is a narrow soul 
that can only be reached through one avenue, 
and M. Verhaeren's is so sensitive that at 
times there has almost seemed a lack of bal- 
ance. His first book, "Les Flamandes," was 
an outburst of crude realism ; it was a positive 
orgy of realistic detail, full of the grosser 
qualities of the old Flemish painters but pos- 
sessing also their exuberant vitality. This 
was followed in 1886 by "Les Moines, " deal- 
ing with the romantic and picturesque fea- 
tures of monasticism rather than with its 
spiritual depths. He did not go further, like 
Huysmans (who also was of Lowland de- 
scent) , to a full reconciliation with the Church. 
Humanity was his subject-matter; the monk 
was but one among the many living men and 
women that attracted him. From this time he 
passed into a spiritual "storm and stress" 
period, fighting his way through a conflict 
with material realities to a more assured 
clearness and repose of soul. It is impossible 
even to name all his volumes. In 1891 we 
find him exclaiming, "I have been a coward, 
and I have fled from the world into a great 
futile egotism"; but, 

" L'aube ouvre un beau conseil de confiance, 
Et qui Fecoute est le sauve 
De son marais, ou nul peche ne fut jamais lave." 

This is the true Verhaeren ; he has come to 
himself ' ' out of the marsh in which no sin was 
ever yet cleansed"; he has made his way 
toward mysticism, and toward a nobler han- 
dling of his material. He is still realistic, and 
never shirks ugly detail; but he has truly 
emerged from haunts of the noisome. He has 
breathed a purer and more serene atmos- 
phere ; the far horizons of his native land have 
shown him something better than mere curl- 
ing fog or driving rain. He has found that 
there is a possible loveliness, a spiritual sig- 
nificance, in the stress and toil and soil of 
human life; he has seen the magic of the 
sunset and the undying hope in the heart of 
man. 

Georges Rodenbach, M. Verhaeren's school- 
fellow, born in the same year, though he 
early left Belgium for Paris, in spirit never 
really left his beloved Bruges. He had nothing 
of his companion's bounding vitality, and his 
poetry, though graceful, is always subdued. 
We chiefly remember him for his prose 
"Bruges la Morte," whose title reminds us 
how the living and the dead have jostled 
together in modern Flanders a land not 
only of vast activities but of dreamy, deserted 
old towns, sweeping rain and solitary sunsets, 



lingering faiths and haunted ruins. Such 
was Belgium a year since; of its future we 
know nothing except that much of its charm 
has been robbed for ever, and that at present 
its glory is the thorny crown of martyrdom. 
There is great diversity in the spirit and tone 
of the poets who have sung for her; some 
have had the daring that questions every- 
thing, others are conservative and Catholic. 
Such is M. Braun, born in 1876, who has drawn 
a beautiful symbolism from the rites of his 
Church, and has written of the benediction of 
the wine, the benediction of the cheeses a 
quite typical blending of the mystical and the 
realistic. Greater than M. Braun is the lyrist 
van Lerberghe, whose verses are pure music. 
With daring imagery he tells us how 

" the sun Avitli golden hair 
Dries the bare 
Feet of the rain." 

M. Andre Fontainas, though a romantic 
symbolist, has dreamed that the joys of mad 
battle and carnage are better than dream- 
ing ; he has thought it would be fine to tread 
the grass of roads down-trodden and red- 
dened by the feet of fugitives. Perhaps now 
he could tell us what he really thinks; for 
elsewhere he says that life is cloudless, calm, 
and passionless. His poems have a beauty 
of the inner life. Peace also is the key-note of 
M. Max Elskamp, with his idealizations of 
religious phrase and symbol. It is a very real 
aspect of Flemish life that he depicts. In 
contrast, writers such as M. Gilkin and M. 
Giraud are frank Satanists. in the manner of 
Baudelaire, dealing with wild excesses of the 
flesh, the visible, the real. It would be pleas- 
ant to linger over the thoughtful poems of 
M. Fernand Severin, or those of M. Paul 
Gerardy (who writes in German as well as in 
French) with their touch of Heine; there 
might also be much to say of M. Georges Mar- 
low, of M. Isi-Collin, of Mme. Jean Domin- 
ique. It is not to be denied that in some of 
these poets, such as M. Mockel and M. Ver- 
haeren, there are aspects to be regretted, too 
free a prodigality of sensuous coloring, too 
free indulgence in profitless realism : but we 
have to take these things as features of the 
national life from which they have sprung, 
and we should not truly understand Belgium 
without them. We have also to remember 
that the writings we have been considering are 
chiefly the work of young men. Youth often 
says too much; discretion, restraint, come 
later. The notable fact is that Belgium's 
amazing virility on the field of battle had 
already manifested its intensity in the domain 
of literature. ARTHUR L. SALMON.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE ENGROSSING THEME which at present 
renders it difficult for either writers or read- 
ers to give undivided attention to what we are 
wont to call pure literature, is of course the 
war. In some quarters a commendable effort 
is made to ignore so harsh a fact. One notes 
with approval the calm disregard of present 
disturbances shown by the staid and venerable 
"Harper's Magazine," while to an old-time 
reader of "The Atlantic Monthly" the readi- 
ness of that esteemed publication to subordi- 
nate literature to discussion of the topic of the 
day might seem more than a little surprising 
and regrettable. One distinguished member 
of the "Harper's" staff, however, no other 
in fact than the genial occupant of the 
"Easy Chair," has favored the public not 
ex cathedra., it is true, not from the chair he 
has so long adorned, but in a newspaper inter- 
view with some well-considered observa- 
tions on the relations of war to literature. 
' ' War stops literature, ' ' he affirms. " It is an 
upheaval of civilization, a return to barbar- 
ism ; it means death to all the arts. Even the 
preparation for war stops literature. It 
stopped it in Germany years ago. A little 
anecdote is significant. I was in Florence 
about 1883, long after the Franco-Prussian 
War, and there I met the editor of a great 
German literary weekly I will not tell you 
its name or his. He was a man- of refinement 
and education, and I have not forgotten his 
great kindness to my own fiction. One day I 
asked him about the German novelists of the 
day. He said: 'There are no longer any 
German novelists worthy of the name. Our 
new ideal has stopped all that. Militarism is 
our new ideal the ideal of Duty and it 
has killed our imagination. So the German 
novel is dead.' ' Russia Mr. Howells does 
not regard as militaristic in the sense that 
Germany and the German people are milita- 
ristic. "Whatever the designs of the ruling 
classes may be, the people of Russia keep their 
simplicity, their large intellectuality and spir- 
ituality. And therefore their imagination 
and other great intellectual and spiritual 
gifts find expression in great novels and 
plays. ' ' This from the one who introduced to 
us the author of "Spring Floods" is signifi- 
cant. One more observation of his must here 
be noted: "Of all the writings which the 
Civil War directly inspired I can think of 
only one that has endured to be called litera- 
ture. That is Lowell's 'Commemoration 
Ode.' ' This would exclude the immortal 
"Battle Hymn," as well as the romances of 
Weir Mitchell and Mr Thomas Nelson Page. 



AN EDUCATIONAL PROBLEM of a novel char- 
acter is puzzling some of our foremost educa- 
tors. Is it for the best interests of culture 
that the war be taught in our schools, or 
should it be ignored? "In all the history of 
education," declares President G. Stanley 
Hall in a current article on "Teaching the 
War, " " I cannot find that pedagogy was ever 
subjected to such a test." Never since the 
general extension of popular education has 
there been anything resembling the present 
world war, and to shut one's eyes and the eyes 
of one's pupils to its significance would seem 
to be extremely foolish, if indeed it were 
humanly possible. The pupil who is taught to 
bury his nose in his Latin grammar and see 
nothing of what is going on about him is being 
instructed in the ways of the ostrich. But, 
it is urged, war is wicked and hateful, and 
even mental contact with the things of mili- 
tarism is corrupting. Seen too oft, familiar 
with Avar's face, we first endure, then pity, 
then embrace. Such teaching bears obvious 
resemblance to the anxious mother's coun- 
sel to her daughter to carry on her exer- 
cises in natation without approaching the 
water. Adopting Tolstoi's wise advice, the 
instructor might well enliven his pupils' study 
of history by teaching it backward, tracing 
present world-shaking events to their more or 
less remote beginnings and causes. Professor 
Cramb of London, some time before his death, 
and many months before the explosion of last 
August, called attention to the manner in 
which the old German Empire rose on the 
ruins of the ancient Roman Empire, and 
pointed out certain present conditions that 
portended, to him at least, the rise of a great 
modern German Empire on the decaying 
structure of the British Empire. Thus the 
linking of current events with past history 
gives unity and a very living significance to 
the study of the world's progress. Inciden- 
tally, too, object lessons in geography and 
ethnology, in manners and customs, in pecul- 
iarities of speech and costume, and in sundry 
other interesting things, are being impressed 
on alert young minds in a manner that has 
never before been possible. Small wonder 
that Dr. Hall is in favor of getting as much 
out of the war as is educationally possible. 


A NEW LIGHT IN FRENCH LITERATURE rises 

to cheer the world in these sad days. An 
inevitable excess of enthusiasm, such as 
greeted, for example, those rather earlier 
luminaries on the horizon, Mr. Rabindranath 
Tagore, M. Romain Rolland, Mr. John Mase- 
field, and Mr. Stephen Phillips, is here to be 
noted, by no means disapprovingly, for we

have it on Wordsworth's authority that we 
live by our enthusiasms. M. Paul Claudel, 
hailed by some of his admirers as ranking with 
JEschylus, Goethe, Dante, yes, even with 
Shakespeare, comes to English-speaking read- 
ers in a small collection of sketches entitled 
"The East I Know," translated with evident 
taste and skill, and introduced by a sympa- 
thetic fellow-countryman, M. Pierre Chavan- 
nes. "A strange phenomenon, the Christian 
poet," he says of the devout author of the 
volume, "passionately, uncompromisingly, 
almost fanatically Catholic, in the country 
where Anatole France, the bantering and dis- 
illusioned master, holds sway, where Renan 
and Voltaire reigned, and with them hard rea- 
son distrustful of the supernatural." As 
illustrative of M. Claudel's style, here is a 
passage from a sketch called "Tombs and 
Rumors. ' ' The author, who has strolled out to 
a suburban cemetery, is listening to the dis- 
tant sounds of a great city. "Chinese cities 
have neither factories nor vehicles. The only 
noise that can be heard, when evening comes 
and the fracas of trade ceases, is the human 
voice. I come to listen for that; for, when 
one loses interest in the sense of the words that 
are offered him, he can still lend them a more 
subtle ear. Nearly a million inhabitants live 
here. I listen to the speech of this multitude 
far under a lake of air. It is a clamor at once 
torrential and crackling, shot through with 
abrupt rips like the tearing of paper. . . . 
Has the city a different murmur at different 
times in the day ? I propose to test it. At this 
moment it is evening. They are volubly pub- 
lishing the day's news. Each one believes 
that he alone is speaking. He recounts quar- 
rels, meals, household happenings, family 
affairs, his work, his commerce, his politics. 
But his words do not perish. . . . Guest of 
the dead, I listen long to the murmur, the 
noise that the living make afar." Probably 
the laurels of Goethe, Dante, Shakespeare, are 
safe enough; nevertheless, this modern 
Frenchman, who has seen something of the 
world in the consular service of his country, 
knows how to describe what he has seen. 


A SELF-CONGRATULATORY EDITOR, indulging 

in a pleasing retrospect upon something 
attempted, something done, invites his read- 
ers to celebrate with him the first anniversary 
of the birth of "The Unpopular Review." 
Infant mortality among magazines and other 
periodicals is far greater, proportionally, than 
among human beings; hence the pardonable 
exultation with which this fond parent of a 
vigorous and promising one-year-old an- 
nounces to the world: "We have survived 



the most dangerous period of infancy, and 
though of course we can't see into our own 
mouth" the parent here identifies himself 
with his offspring "and are too young 
effectively to handle a looking-glass, we infer 
from some remarks we've heard, that we've 
cut some teeth ; we have had some pains that 
felt like it. ' ' Contrary to the usual rule, one 
is glad to learn, this lusty young quarterly 
has elicited from subscribers and others far 
more testimonials of hearty appreciation than 
letters of complaint and fault-finding. In the 
most distant and unlikely quarters it has 
raised up to itself friends and admirers. May 
it not be that the fate-defying title of the 
magazine, piquing curiosity as it does, has 
had more than a little to do with this initial 
success? But however that may be, it is a 
success not to be grudged to the able and 
alert men and women of letters who are 
making "The Unpopular" so readable if not 
exactly "popular" in the "best-selling" 
sense of that term. To the pardonably com- 
placent editor we say, in the words of the 
poet already quoted in this paragraph, happy, 
thrice happy, every one who sees his labor 
well begun, and not perplexed and multiplied 
by idly waiting for time and tide. 


THE CATHOLICITY OF POPULAR TASTE IN FIC- 
TION shows itself in the range and variety of 
imaginative literature that has been success- 
fully adapted to the uses of the cinemato- 
graph. In the "Branch Library News" 
published monthly by the New York Public 
Library is printed a list of the works of fiction 
that have been thus translated from the liter- 
ary into the pictorial form. Thirty-nine such 
works are enumerated, from Mrs. Barclay's 
novel, "The Rosary," at the head of the list, 
to Mr. Owen Wister's presentation of a quite 
different set of characters and incidents in 
"The Virginian." Strong indeed is the con- 
trast in literary excellence between the first 
book named and two half-way down the list. 
"The House of Seven Gables" and "The 
Scarlet Letter. " " The Vicar of Wakefield, ' ' 
too, must not be overlooked in naming the 
masterpieces now offered to the millions fre- 
quenting the "movies," nor Dickens 's works 
(to the number of eight novels or stories), 
Stevenson's "Treasure Island," Mrs. Jack- 
son's "Ramona," Hugo's "Les Miserables," 
Mr. Sienkiewicz's "Quo Vadis," Mrs. Shel- 
ley's "Frankenstein," and, of course, Mrs. 
Stowe's "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Though the 
list does not profess to be complete, it ought 
to have included "The Pilgrim's Progress," 
which has found favor as exhibited on the 
screen, appealing as it does to somewhat the

same taste as the Biblical story of Joseph, 
which has a place on the list. New titles are 
of course being added to these thirty-nine, 
with accelerating rapidity. 


POETRY IN WARTIME is holding its own cred- 
itably in this country at least, as Mr. William 
Stanley Braithwaite makes evident by the 
second annual issue of his "Anthology of 
Magazine Verse and Yearbook of American 
Poetry," a work compiled and published by 
him with admirable industry, taste, and, not 
least of all, courage. Ten years ago, when 
interest in American poetry was nearly at its 
lowest, and consequently much of that poetry 
was but little worthy of serious attention, Mr. 
Braithwaite took it upon himself to examine 
critically, but not in a destructive spirit, the 
magazine verse of the calendar year, and to 
report upon it in an enlightening and on the 
whole encouraging summary which appeared 
in the Boston "Transcript." This labor of 
love he continued year after year until his 
annual report became an influential contribu- 
tion to the cause of better poetry in this coun- 
try and even beyond its borders ; and now for 
two years he has expanded this report and 
compilation to the dimensions of a modest vol- 
ume. This year, more than ever before, we 
have reason to feel gratified with the results of 
his studies, for they show that war's alarms 
and excitements have not diverted our poets 
from their high calling, nor even concentrated 
their attention upon martial themes. Mr. 
Braithwaite maintains that the general excel- 
lence of the last twelve months' products of 
American magazine verse is higher than ever 
a most encouraging pronouncement. 


THE DRAMA AS AN INSTRUMENT OF REFORM, 

not as a form of art or a means of recrea- 
tion, was discussed in characteristic fashion 
by M. Eugene Brieux in his recent lecture and 
reading at Smith College. His visit to Amer- 
ica has been called an "informal, amicable 
ambassadorship," and his public addresses 
have shown him to be quite as much a humani- 
tarian and reformer as he is a playwright. 
The lover of art for art's sake, pure and 
simple, must find little use for such ideas as 
this distinguished Frenchman is ventilating 
among us. He talked at Northampton on the 
subject of the problem play, called by many 
the boring play, and insisted that most of the 
notable comedies, including even the lighter 
ones of Moliere, are really problem plays. 
He read from his own play, "Le Berceau," 
the lesson of which seems to be that married 
persons having children should not be allowed 
to be divorced; and from "Les Rempla- 



cantes," which is directed against the custom 
of importing wet-nurses from the country to 
minister to the needs of Paris infants, often 
at the expense of these peasant women's own 
children. That the stage should be devoted to 
higher uses than mere amusement was the doc- 
trine preached from first to last by M. Brieux, 
who perhaps is too much inclined to lose sight 
of the fact that the highest of all possible 
uses may at times be served by an inspired 
work of pure art. 



THE POPULARIZATION OF CULTURE progresses 
apace. In Massachusetts, already not the 
least cultured of our States, the establish- 
ment of a state university, in addition to the 
excellent agricultural college at Amherst, is 
under consideration. A bill for the creation 
of such an institution was presented in the 
last legislature, and was referred to the board 
of education for careful consideration. In 
connection with it an alternative plan is un- 
der advisement for paying the tuition fees of 
all Massachusetts students attending existing 
colleges, universities, and scientific schools of 
a certain standard. This would be a rather 
startling as well as questionable application 
of the patriarchal idea in government. But 
the tax-payers, through their delegated 
spokesmen, will have a word to say about 
free Latin and Greek to the youth of the 
commonwealth.

" MOMMSEN AND THE WAK." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In your issue of January 1 you publish a com- 
munication from Mr. Hodder, " Mommsen and the 
War." It seems indeed strange that the discovery 
of Mommsen as one of the fathers of German 
Imperialism has come so late. I sincerely hope 
that this is only the beginning of a long series of 
similarly startling discoveries. In the meantime I 
beg to ask a few questions of you and Mr. Hodder 
for my enlightenment (I am only a plain American 
citizen of German descent and therefore naturally 
slow in understanding Anglo-Saxon logic) : 

(1) What does the "Declaration of Indepen- 
dence" mean? Independence of English rule or 
German rule? 

(2) Who has wronged Ireland in the past, En- 
gland or Germany? 

(3) Who has conquered India, Egypt, and the 
Boer Republics in South Africa? England or 
Germany ? 

(4) Who controls the sea? 

(5) Who is older, Nietzsche or Treitschke? My 
teachers in school said Treitschke was ten years 
older than Nietzsche; have you more accurate 



information?

THE VARIOUSLY ACCOMPLISHED 

liOUD AVEBURY.* 



To his thousands of readers and admirers 
the late Lord Avebury will always remain Sir 
John Lubbock, of "St. Lubbock 's Day" fame, 
author of many delightful Lubbock books, and 
especially associated with certain entrancing 
chapters on ants, bees, and wasps, with sun- 
dry inspiring volumes on the pleasures and 
the uses of life, and, more recently, with a 
widely accepted list of the hundred best books 
in all literature. A playful rhymester in 
"Punch" years ago put into four lines the 
popular conception of the man's chief claims 
to renown, and even now, after a third of a 
century, they have not lost their epigram- 
matic appropriateness. They were appended 
to a " Fancy Portrait ' ' of Sir John under the 
semblance of a huge bumble-bee, and ran as 
follows : 

" How doth the Banking Busy Bee 

Improve the shining hours, 
By studying on Bank Holidays 
Strange insects and wild flowers." 

Like many another versatile genius before 
and since, Lubbock suffered in his reputation 
with specialists from the great variety of 
channels through which he allowed his super- 
abundant energies to flow. Among bankers, 
as it was rather cruelly and not quite accu- 
rately said of him, he was known as a famous 
scientist, and among scientists as an eminent 
banker. His introduction of the highly suc- 
cessful Bank Holiday into English business 
life does indeed link his name lastingly with 
London banking, as his popular treatises on 
insects associate him with the entomologists; 
but his device of a system of cooperative clear- 
ing for checks and notes received by London 
banks from the country, instead of the labo- 
rious and time-consuming individual treat- 
ment of such commercial items that gave place 
to it, showed him to be both expert and origi- 
nal in the sphere of banking, just as, for 
example, his early researches in the vitelli- 
genous glands of insects proved him to be not 
lacking in capacity for independent observa- 
tion and discovery in natural science. 

Born in 1834, his adolescent years fell at a 
rather fortunate time and amid rather favor- 
able surroundings for the development of his 
peculiar tastes and aptitudes. Darwin lived 
at Down, about a mile from the Lubbock 
home at High Elms, and to the influence and

encouragement of the great naturalist he owed 
much. Acquaintance too was made with such 
contemporary men of science as Lyell, Huxley, 
Tyndall, and Spencer. Though his formal 
education did not extend beyond Eton, be- 
cause both he and his father, a banker with a 
bent for mathematics, had a poor opinion of 
the almost exclusively classical curriculum of 
that day, and though he was called from his 
books at fifteen to take a place of responsibility 
in the paternal banking house, yet his extraor- 
dinary industry and mental activity made it 
possible for him to achieve the sort of intel- 
lectual training that really counted in his case 
and that was probably the best possible one 
for the work that lay before him. 

The story of that work, branching out in 
many directions and rich in the astonishing 
variety of things attempted and carried 
through, is what the reader finds presented 
in attractive detail in Mr. Horace G. Hutchin- 
son 's "Life of Sir John Lubbock," a biog- 
raphy filling two considerable volumes and 
undertaken with the sanction and assistance 
of Lady Avebury and other members of the 
family. Letters, diaries, and other private 
papers have been placed at the author's dis- 
posal, and they have been of great service in 
making possible a full and accurate chronologi- 
cal account of Lubbock's achievements in 
science and in public life, in authorship and in 
banking, as a legislator and reformer and 
zealous promoter of multitudinous good 
causes; but, unfortunately for the best inter- 
ests of biography as a fascinating form of 
literature, these papers have not, as the biog- 
rapher admits, proved to be of much help in 
conveying any intimate sense of what man- 
ner of human being Lord Avebury really was. 
Huxley's letters are far more characteristic 
of the writer, far more enjoyable and sug- 
gestive in the reading, than any but a few of 
the earlier ones from the pen of his more ver- 
satile younger contemporary. However, it is 
perhaps impossible for a man to put the best 
of himself into a series of books too numerous 
even to count without weariness, besides leav- 
ing his impress on the laws of his nation and 
on the public life of his day and generation, 
and at the same time draw his own likeness 
with speaking fidelity in his daily correspon- 
dence. Certainly Lubbock has not done so, 
and therefore to the number of those biogra- 
phies whose chief excellence lies in their being 
little short of autobiographies Mr. Hutchin- 
son 's work, however admirable in other re- 
spects, cannot belong. 

On the title-page of the book one notes the 
rather conspicuous insertion, to the length of 
fifteen lines in small print, of Lord Avebury 's

many society memberships and honorary de- 
grees, just as in the later published works 
from his own pen these innumerable adjuncts 
to his name have not failed to make their 
appearance, somewhat to the surprise of those 
who like to imagine the author of ' ' The Pleas- 
ures of Life" a person of simple tastes and 
unaffected deportment. The reason of this 
parade of personal distinctions we are now 
glad to find set forth with some care by the 
biographer. It is worth quoting. 

" He was honorary member and fellow of an 
extraordinarily large number of learned societies, 
both home and foreign, and bearer of distinctions 
as various as his talents. Some surprise has been 
expressed at the conscientiousness with which he 
gave at full length, after his name on the title- 
pages of his books, the initial letters indicating 
these degrees, etc. Certainly Lord Avebury's very 
simple character, without a touch of cynicism in its 
composition, made him highly appreciative of the 
recognition of his fellows, but one of his publishers 
has explained to me what he believes to have been 
his real motive in inscribing at full the initials sig- 
nifying his dignities. Lord Avebury, in his opin- 
ion, was influenced by the feeling that if any let- 
ters of the kind were affixed to a name, a certain 
slight was cast on the institution which had hon- 
oured him if the distinguishing initials of that 
institution were omitted. His idea was that all or 
none should be given, more especially as many of 
the distinctions were of foreign origin, and it was 
particularly imperative, by all laws of courtesy, 
not to hurt foreign feelings. It is a motive per- 
fectly in accord with Lord Avebury's peculiar 
kindliness and sensitive consideration of other 
people." 

In this connection there is an amusing bit of 
correspondence given by Mr. Hutchinson 
which perhaps may help to explain this punc- 
tiliousness in the use of titles. An East Indian 
scholar once exchanged some letters with the 
author of "The Pleasures of Life" on the sub- 
ject of a proposed translation of that book 
into one of the dialects of India; and in the 
latter part of the correspondence occurs this 
reproachful passage from the pen of the Orien- 
tal: "Formerly your Lordship used to ad- 
dress ' Mr. ' or ' Esquire, ' but I don 't know why 
your Lordship have omitted in the last two 
letters. Although I did not gain or lose any- 
thing by it, but still I wonder. ' ' 

Lubbock's power of getting things done, 
both in his own person and through others, 
argues unusual energy and the strictest 
economy of time. Indeed, among his early 
papers there are various schemes or schedules 
assigning its particular task to each hour or 
half-hour of the day with a painful particu- 
larity hardly surpassed by "Queed" himself 
in the prime of his priggishness. An anecdote 
very much to the point is as follows : 



" One of his sons told me that on the day that 
his father first took him into the City, to introduce 
him to the partners of their business house, Lord 
Avebury drew a book out of his pocket as soon as 
they were seated in the ' tube,' and said, ' I think 
you will find it a good plan always to have a book 
with you, in your pocket, to read at odd times,' and 
therewith he became at once so absorbed in his 
reading as to be quite unconscious of his fellow- 
travellers and their conversation." 

A pleasant personal touch and also an inci- 
dental testimony to the popularity of Lub- 
bock's books are to be found in another 
passage that offers itself for citation. The 
eldest boy by his second marriage had just 
been sent away to school at Rottingdean. 

" Sir John affectionately notes the sorrow of 
himself and of Lady Lubbock in parting with him, 
but from the very first the school seems to have 
been a success. The boy was happy there, his 
reports were good and, for his age, he took a high 
place. His father and mother went down to see 
him. Sir John writes that Harold conducted him 
to the school library and pointed out with pride to 
the father that all the latter's books were ' out ' 
boys were reading them. He said they were always 
out and were among the most popular. In this 
year both the Pleasures and the Use of Life were 
translated into Greek, Arabic, and Japanese." 

It is the first of the above-named books that, 
of all his works, has won for its author the 
largest number of readers, being now in its two 
hundred and seventy-second thousand (in 
Part I.) and in its two hundred and thirty- 
second thousand (in Part II.). Of the some- 
what less popular kindred work, ' ' The Use of 
Life," the author noted seventeen years ago 
that, beside editions in English, the book had 
appeared in French (seven editions), German, 
Dutch, Polish, Bohemian, Spanish, Italian, 
Greek, Arabic (five editions), Marathi, Gujer- 
athi, Japanese (six editions), Danish, Rus- 
sian, Armenian, and Esthonian. 

As a zealously active member of Parliament 
and, after 1900, an energetic participant in 
the less momentous proceedings of the House 
of Lords, Lubbock advocated successfully 
many needed reforms and improvements. In 
a single parliamentary session we find him 
introducing three important bills, one for 
the earlier closing of shops, one for amending 
the public-library law, and one to facilitate 
the forming of open spaces in large cities. 
The first was blocked, says his biographer ; the 
other two were passed. He held, first and 
last, a great number of chairmanships, includ- 
ing that of the London County Council, and 
he served the causes of science and humanity 
and education in various capacities, official 
and unofficial. In fact, the list of his activities 
is much too long to be given here. Mr. Hutch- 
inson makes an impressive showing of these

varied interests and occupations, and has pro- 
duced a useful and not uninspiring biography. 
It is a record such as the late Dr. Samuel 
Smiles would have taken delight in pointing 
to as a most helpful one for eager and ambi- 
tious youth. Its lessons in the value of econ- 
omy of time, making the most of one's 
resources, controlling one's temper under 
provocation, and so on, are many and obvious. 
Lord Avebury's qualities seem to have been 
admirable without exception, and these quali- 
ties are well depicted by his biographer. Two 
portraits of the man and views of two country 
houses belonging to him adorn the volumes.

THE DRAMA MOVEMENT.* 



The new drama is still young, still youth- 
fully and vigorously uncertain, still the sub- 
ject of prophecy; but it seems nevertheless to 
have reached age and reliability enough to 
warrant the attempt to define it and to esti- 
mate the significance of its achievement and 
its tendencies. Among the most recent books, 
Mr. Sheldon Cheney's " The New Movement 
in the Theatre " is a broad survey of strictly 
contemporaneous dramatic activity, especially 
in England and the United States, and " The 
Changing Drama, ' ' by Mr. Archibald Hender- 
son, an already well-known writer on the 
European dramatists, is a critical account of 
the contributions and tendencies of the past 
sixty years. If the lover of the stage will add 
to these two Mr. Richard Burton's "How to 
See a Play," he will possess the means of 
greatly increasing his capacity for enjoyment 
of the contemporary drama, whether as reader 
or witness. 

While Mr. Burton's volume shares the char- 
acter of the other two in containing a measure 
of historical and critical matter, it is first of all 
a practical work, whose concern is the need of 
the play-reader or theatre-goer. It discourses 
vigorously and sensibly on the structure of 
the play and the method of its composition, 
upon the qualities which make it real drama, 
upon its value as a cultural opportunity, and 
upon its possibilities as a factor in social im- 
provement. It recites the principal facts in 
the history of the drama, leads up to and char- 
acterizes the modern school, and helps the 
reader to the means of making its literary as 
well as its stage acquaintance. Mr. Burton's 
immediate purpose is the enlightenment of the

play-lover for his own sake; but he has the 
ulterior purpose, as befits the President of the 
Drama League of America, of encouraging 
good drama by helping to provide the ideal 
audience. 

Mr. Cheney divides his time about evenly 
between characterization of the play- writer's 
work and characterization of the new stage- 
craft. He has a great deal to say in praise of 
the new drama, especially in England, as "the 
drama of sincerity." In America he sees the 
movement as "hardly more than a promise," 
in England and on the Continent as "both a 
promise and a vital, lasting achievement." 
He is especially enthusiastic for Mr. Gordon 
Craig and the "a?sthetic theatre movement," 
and hostile to naturalistic stagecraft, which 
he assails under the name of "Belascoism" as 
the "theatre producer's perfect realization of 
a false ideal." Recognizing the tyranny of 
play-house commercialism in the United 
States, for real progress he looks to such 
smaller centres of drama interest as the uni- 
versities and colleges, and the "art" theatres 
in the larger cities. The authority of Mr. 
Cheney's otherwise excellent book is impaired 
by repetition and careless expression. The 
last chapter, especially, on "Gordon Craig's 
Service," contains a great deal that is already 
said in earlier chapters. There is too much 
of "gripping" and "sincere" and "vital," to 
say nothing of lapses like ' ' chief protagonist, ' ' 
"such protagonists as Gordon Craig, etc.," 
' ' touches were infused, ' ' and ' ' refreshing reti- 
cence of touch." This, however, is perhaps to 
be charged to the New Education rather than 
to the author. There are not a few who suspect 
that the "new and broader universities that 
are so splendidly maintaining their place at 
the forefront of American progress," to use 
Mr. Cheney's words, are doing rather less to 
preserve the ideal of the English language 
than the " old hidebound institutions, with 
their set academic standards," that come un- 
der his condemnation. 

Mr. Henderson's book is primarily critical, 
and is exceedingly stimulating. Such chapter 
headings as ' ' The New Criticism and the New 
Ethics," "Realism and the Pulpit Stage," 
"The Battle with Illusions," "The New 
Technic," "The New Content," and "The 
Newer Tendencies," indicate at once its com- 
prehensiveness, its philosophic character, and 
its pugnacious tone. Ibsen and Shaw are its 
main figures, and the social significance of the 
drama is the theme that runs through the 
whole discussion. Many indeed will think the 
theme too prominent. "The great discovery 
of modern life ... is ... that society has 
become the tyrant of the universe"; "the

77 



deterministic pressure of social institutions, 
the tyranny of capital"; "the curved backs 
of oppressed humanity"; "the tocsin of re- 
volt"; "an age that fought with dragons and 
an age that fights with microbes"; "the dra- 
matic artists of to-day, of all races and all 
climes, have a sense of common purpose, a cer- 
tain unity of aim," that "may best be de- 
scribed as the intention of advancing the cause 
of civilization" there is an abundance of 
these familiar expressions, and theatre-goer 
and play-writer begin to wonder as they read 
whether one more tyrant has not been set over 
dramatic art in the shape of sociology. There 
are drama-lovers who, while recognizing the 
fact of human suffering and sympathizing 
with it, cannot agree that social tyranny has 
spread to the stars, or that the fault is never in 
ourselves that we are underlings, but always 
in society, or that a social drama will prove 
the means of regeneration. These people 
would like the privilege of sometimes wit- 
nessing, reading, or writing plays for pure 
pleasure plays which they dare to think 
may be made by the real artist as efficacious 
as the drama of "social conscientiousness" 
and ' ' moral propagandism. ' ' In spite of over- 
emphasis of the social theme, however, and in 
spite of needless protests against the poor old 
unities and ' ' art for art 's sake, ' ' which no one 
has insisted on for a long time now, and 
against a really no longer tyrannous "person 
called Aristotle," in Mr. Granville Barker's 
phrase, Mr. Henderson's volume is full of 
thoughtful and illuminating criticism on the 
drama as art, and deserves high praise. 

The reading of Mr. Cheney and Mr. Hen- 
derson for Dr. Burton's book is different in 
purpose and character begets a number of 
impressions in regard to the new drama. In 
the first place, it is clear that there is really 
something being achieved, and that the some- 
thing has to do with art as well as propa- 
gandism. In the second place, there exist a 
striking number and variety of stage repre- 
sentations claiming recognition as dramatic 
art, and there is a great deal of fruitful ex- 
perimentation in process. Mr. Cheney, after 
removing farce, melodrama, musical comedy, 
and vaudeville, carefully divides what is left 
into aesthetic drama, represented by Mr. 
Gordon Craig's marionette-drama, Herr Rein- 
hardt's mimo-drama, and the Russian dance- 
drama; the drama of emotion, where "the 
appeal to the eye and the ear is merely a very 
small aid to the effectiveness of the whole"; 
and the drama of thought, where more empha- 
sis is placed on the theme. Mr. Henderson 
defines a play as ' ' any presentation of human 
life by human interpreters on a stage in a 



theatre before a representative audience, ' ' and 
a drama as " a particular kind of a play. ' ' 

Mr. Henderson's definition seems at first 
sight handsomely liberal, though it doesn't 
provide for the dance and marionettes; but 
the next sentence, which begins three pages of 
interpretation by saying that "the play in- 
trinsically, and its representation by the 
interpreters, must be so effective, interesting, 
and moving as to induce the normal individual 
in appreciable numbers to make a sacrifice of 
money and time, either one or both, for the 
privilege of witnessing its performance," 
would go a long way toward keeping the 
classics outside the definition. Who is the 
normal individual ? At least the normal indi- 
vidual of American theatrical commerce does 
not go to classic plays in appreciable numbers. 

But one receives the impression, too, that 
the classics, both ancient and less remote^ 
count comparatively little with either Mr. 
Henderson or Mr. Cheney. Like other valiant 
champions of the New, their first impulse is to 
dispose of the past, and the past in these pro- 
gressive days is more or less defenceless. 
They don't have to prove the ignorance and 
tyranny of the past ; they simply admit these 
and all its other vices and incapabilities, and 
go on. Mr. Cheney "has very little respect 
for what is commonly taken (like medicine) as 
authoritative criticism." Mr. Henderson 
laments that "our critics of the drama 
are unfortunately classic in predilection." 
Shakespeare didn't love the common man r 
Moliere sympathized with society rather 
than the individual, and the Greeks missed 
the social point utterly. "The false assump- 
tion, which has persisted from the time of the 
Greeks to the present day, " is a phrase which 
can be applied with ease and comparative 
safety to anything the modernist wishes to 
remove from the path of his argument. Along 
with other things New there seems to be a 
New Logic, which is almost capable of saying 
what it really means : ' ' The world up to our 
day has thought thus-and-so; we think other- 
wise ; therefore, the world up to our day has 
thought wrong. ' ' The statements of Aristotle, 
we are told, are incomplete and ridiculous, 
and he is guilty of gross and exaggerated dis- 
tortions of the truth. To prove Aristotle's 
comparative mediocrity as a critic of the 
drama by assuming that he knew nothing 
beyond what he says, is of course no worse 
than to prove his infallibility by assuming that 
what he says implies everything he doesn't 
say. It is the principle that is objectionable 
the use of an ancient and helpless person 
to prove anything or everything, as if he were 
mere statistics, or, let us say, the "facts"

connected with the immediate beginning of a, 
great war. 

Yet in spite of this independence and self- 
sufficiency in the partisans of the New Drama, 
it can hardly fail to strike the attention of the 
reader familiar with the classics that many of 
the virtues claimed for the drama of to-day 
are precisely the classical virtues, and the 
ancient classical virtues at that. Compact- 
ness, simplicity of plot and omission of sub- 
plot, breadth of character-drawing, the re- 
turn to the purely human, the use of scant 
and simple scenery, the open-air performance, 
the relief-theatre, the reconciliation of litera- 
ture and the stage, the tendency toward relig- 
ious drama enumerate these things to one 
acquainted with the whole course of the 
drama, and it will be Sophocles that he thinks 
of, not Ibsen or Shaw. Even the much- 
abused unities are being made welcome, in the 
one-act drama now so frequent. Gather all 
these virtues together, add nobility of lan- 
guage, without which drama can only by 
exception be other than local and ephemeral, 
and ' ' the sense of the nobility of life, ' ' which 
Mr. Cheney says the dramatists of the new 
movement lack, insist less on ' ' the mystery and 
immensity of little things" and "the apotheo- 
sis of the insignificant," and more on univer- 
sals, and we shall possess again the ideal of 
twenty-five hundred years ago, the departure 
from which, as Martin Schanz has said, never 
fails to bring its own revenge. Then get a 
national theatre and cultivated audiences, and 
the acting and writing of great drama will 
depend upon the presence of genius among us. 

But we do not possess all these virtues, 
either in America or abroad. The new drama, 
like all youth, is too confident, and claims too 
much. A little more modesty and a little less 
combativeness would be as well for the cause 
we all have at heart. The classics are not so 
dead, nor the new drama so "vital and last- 
ing," as the new critics think. Ibsen, who 
receives so much attention from Mr. Hender- 
son, is already recognized by the new English 
artists, according to Mr. Cheney, as "not of 
their country, or their time (for the world has 
taken mighty strides forward since he ceased 
to write)." The social themes of to-day may 
easily prove to have been neither for all time 
nor for all places, and the ' ' symbolic romance, 
extensive, vast," which in Mr. Henderson's 
thinking ' ' bids fair to express best the artistic 
sense of the coming century," may have its 
own ' ' new content. ' ' As to national theatres, 
in America we have none, and are not likely 
to have them under popular government until 
the popular idea of the usefulness of literature 
and the fine arts has undergone a change. 



The opportunity to hear good drama comes 
rarely to all but a very few places, and when it 
does come costs the price of a half barrel of 
flour for the Belgians. Art drama at cost, 
produced by our dramatic societies, is con- 
demned beforehand as "highbrow," and is 
poorly patronized. In all but a few journals, 
criticism of the drama is either identical with 
advertising or the best is like the worst. Even 
the Drama League of America puts the pro- 
hibitive price of seventy-five cents on its pub- 
lished single plays by contemporary authors. 
It was possible at one time in the long ago to 
get a play of Shakespeare for six cents, and 
the difference is not explainable wholly on the 
ground of Shakespeare's inferiority.

THE 



FKAXCE.* 



For many years it has been the fashion 
among superficial observers to regard France 
as a decadent nation. It is true that for some 
time her population has been stationary and, 
indeed, the last census (1911) disclosed an 
excess of deaths over births; but the phe- 
nomenon of a declining birth rate is by no 
means peculiar to France it exists in most 
countries and is symptomatic of our so-called 
higher civilization. The situation in France 
differs from that in England, Germany, and 
the United States only in degree, and it seems 
only a question of time when the populations 
of these countries will cease to increase. 
There has also been a popular belief that the 
mental and physical vigor of the French, their 
national spirit, their patriotism, and their 
capacity to govern themselves have all been 
on the decline. To whatever degree this belief 
may have been well founded in the past, no 
well-informed person regards it as true to-day. 

In a book entitled ' ' France Herself Again ' ' 
M. Ernest Dimnet, a professor in the College 
of St. Stanislaus, Paris, and a distinguished 
scholar who writes in perfect English, dwells 
upon the far-reaching transformation which 
the national spirit of France has undergone in 
recent years. That a remarkable change has 
come over France since the beginning of the 
twentieth century, he says, cannot be denied 
or doubted, for everybody has felt it or heard 
of it. To present a picture of this change in 
its true perspective M. Dimnet starts out with 
a review of the intellectual and moral deterio- 
ration of France which set in during the 
Second Empire and continued steadily until 
the Tangier incident of 1905, an event which 
seemed to awaken the French to a realization

of their national consciousness and kindle in 
the nation an esprit nouveau. After fifty 
years of fruitless and often foolish experi- 
mentation, distracted and gradually corrupted 
by false ideals and low morals, during which 
her precious hours and resources were wasted, 
France now desires to be a nation once more : 

" She is like a man whom philosophy or science 
mere intellectual pursuits have absorbed until 
some great sorrow makes him feel that he has a 
heart as well as a brain and has to live as well as to 
think in a way that will fit him for life." 

At the beginning of the Second Empire, 
France had only one rival in Europe that 
was England. The feeling of national su- 
premacy was expressed in a speech of the 
Emperor shortly after his accession in 1852 
when he said, ' ' France is happy, Europe may 
now live in peace." This was no mere boast 
but an absolutely true statement of French 
supremacy on the Continent. To-day all is 
changed. France no longer has it within her 
power to impose her will upon Europe. The 
German Empire, Italy, and Austria have risen 
oy her side to dispute her old time suprem- 
acy. The deterioration began, as has been 
said, in the midst of the outward splendors 
of the Second Empire, when the seeds of 
materialism, the decadence of morals, the un- 
wholesomeness of literature, the hatred of 
Christianity (under the guise of anti-clerical- 
ism) were planted; and these seeds produced 
their full fruition during the Third Republic. 
During this period the French lived on illu- 
sions as on pleasure. Everyone seemed bent 
on deceiving himself. Everywhere the spirit 
of ideology and self-satisfaction was dominant. 
France was weakened by ideas which obscured 
Tier reason and enervated her moral powers. 
She could have quickly recovered from the 
losses of 1870 had it not been for the intellec- 
tual deterioration which a harmful philosophy 
and a lawless literature produced. "Within 
twenty years, we are told, after Napoleon's 
boast that France was the arbiter of Europe, 
she had "fallen in power, influence, popula- 
tion and moral energy behind a rival whose 
greatness her own monarch had helped and 
practically made." The chief cause of the 
moral and political decadence of France under 
the Third Republic and the "state of dis- 
order" in which the country found itself after 
the retirement of Thiers, according to M. 
Dimnet, is to be found in the character of the 
constitution. It is, he says, a mere makeshift 
and is ' ' not only democratic but demagogic in 
its principles." The President of the Repub- 
lic is a mere dummy without real authority. 
He presides without governing, he attends 
inaugurations, opens expositions, distributes 



the grand prix, and hunts rabbits. He cannot 
exercise a single one of the numerous and 
important powers which the letter of the writ- 
ten constitution gives him. The Radicals have 
for a long time advocated the abolition of the 
Presidency, but the great majority of the peo- 
ple desire a President who shall be a leader 
and a real executive like the President of the 
United States. When M. Poincare was elected 
the people believed and hoped that he would 
be something more than a figurehead, but he 
too, like his predecessors, has adopted a policy 
of self-effacement. Under the operation of the 
constitution, as it has developed, he could not 
do otherwise. The whole trouble lies in the 
attitude of the parliament, which insists on 
subordinating every other power in the state 
to itself. It is not content with legislating 
and controlling the ministers in respect to 
their general policies, but it insists on govern- 
ing and administering as well. The result is 
short-lived ministries (there have been about 
fifty-five since the establishment of the Third 
Republic) and a President who plays only a 
ceremonial role. In its colonial and foreign 
policy, the Republic, we are told, has failed; 
in education the results have been unsatisfac- 
tory and the education of the schools is mak- 
ing the country a nation of atheists. The 
bourgeois democracy is a fraud and the coun- 
try has been cursed with petty, low-born, God- 
hating politicians who, not content with secu- 
larizing the schools, have broken up the 
religious orders, confiscated their property, 
dispersed poor monks and nuns 'who had 
grown gray in the service of philanthropy, 
education, and charity, persecuted the church, 
and abrogated a solemn compact with the 
papacy that had endured more than a hundred 
years. Not stopping with this, the Radicals 
have tried to drive Catholics from the army 
and the civil service. M. Dimnet 's indictment 
of the Radicals for their anti-clerical policy is 
severe, but there is another side to the ques- 
tion which naturally, because of his clerical 
affiliations, he entirely ignores. He makes no 
reference to the opposition of the church to 
the Republic, and its well-known activities in 
favor of the monarchy ; nothing is said of the 
persecution of the greatest of French scholars 
and statesmen who were too liberal for the 
church, of its fight against Dreyfus, of its 
championship of MacMahon in the great crisis 
of 1877, of its sympathy for Boulanger, and 
of its opposition to science and liberal educa- 
tion. The Republicans of France believed, 
and the evidence is not lacking, that the 
schools, which until recently were under the 
control of the church, were teaching the chil- 
dren to hate the Republic. For these and

other reasons which cannot be discussed here, 
the Republicans of France were compelled to 
do what they did, and although there may 
have been unnecessary harshness and severity 
in their methods, the general principle of their 
legislation is what Americans have always 
stood for. 

France, according to M. Dimnet, had 
reached a state bordering on degradation when 
the Tangier affair of 1905 came like a flash of 
lightning after which the clouds lifted. It 
was one of those events, we are told, which 
rapidly destroys a whole system of thought. 
Since that time France has entered upon an 
era of regeneration, she has awakened from 
her apathy, and is beginning to return to her 
own. A great change has occurred in the 
national spirit, in the mode of thinking, in the 
character of the national literature, and even 
in the attitude of the Radical party, which 
seems disposed to adopt a policy of greater 
conciliation toward the church. 

In a concluding chapter written after the 
outbreak of the present war, the author re- 
marks that while France has been the victim 
of politicians and while the history of the 
Third Republic has been a history of radical 
blunders, recent events have shown that the 
nation has remained sound at the core. Ani- 
mated by a new spirit, conscious of her power, 
France is ready to meet her duty. What she 
now needs most is not a conversion of mind or 
soul but a transformation of her institutions. 
With better institutions and the kind of lead- 
ers she desires, the beginning of the century 
will soon appear as one of the greatest turning 
points in her history. 

With much of what M. Dimnet has to say in 
criticism of the French constitution and of the 
class of politicians that have governed the 
country since the advent of the Third Re- 
public, well-informed Americans will agree, 
although there will be a difference of opinion 
concerning his reproach of the Republicans 
for their anti-clerical policy. Most of us will 
feel that his rather gloomy picture of French 
democracy and his indictment of the Republic 
have been overdrawn, but we all will share 
with him the pride which he feels in the birth 
of a new France, and his optimism for the 
future. JAMES W. GARNER. 



STUDIES IN THE HISTORY or ART.* 



Of the essays in Mr. Richard Norton's luxu- 
rious volume, "Bernini, and Other Studies in 
the History of Art," some continue the lit- 
erary tradition of English criticism, others 

* BERNINI, AND OTHER STUDIES IN THE HISTORY OF ART. By 
Richard Norton. With sixty-nine plates. New York: The 
Macmillan Co. 



the scientific tradition of exact scholarship. 
To the first group belong the estimate of 
Bernini, the "Art of Portraiture," the 
"Phidias and Michael Angelo," and, essen- 
tially, the "Head of Athena from Gyrene." 
Not claiming to add to our stock of knowledge, 
they seek to clarify it or to modify our critical 
judgments. 

The most powerful of these, and the most 
necessary, is the essay on Bernini. Since 
Ruskin, and in the English-speaking world, 
Bernini, like all the artists of the Baroque, has 
lain under the condemnation of a prejudice 
at once irrelevant and unjustified. An ethical 
criterion, itself not germane, has been invoked 
against them, without appreciation of their 
own moral sincerity. More serious, because 
more philosophically supported, is the notion 
that they represent a time of purely artistic 
decay, inevitably following periods of growth 
and maturity. The analogy with organic life 
which this view presupposes, however, like- 
wise has failed of demonstration, and the his- 
tory of art, if subjected to any metaphor, 
seems rather a succession of beats of a pendu- 
lum, or an alternating crescendo and diminu- 
endo, at any point of which greatness may 
appear. Mr. Norton finds Bernini's greatness 
in merits characteristic of his own time and 
individuality spiritual intensity, artistic 
crescendo, dramatic power as well as in per- 
sonal and moral qualities common to the 
titanic spirits of all ages. It is primarily with 
Bernini's work in sculpture that the author 
has concerned himself, passing lightly over 
equally distinguished work in architecture, 
yet in the field of sculpture alone he makes 
good his claim that Bernini is to be ranked as 
one of the world 's greatest masters. 

The other essays of this group, dealing with 
less controversial material, lead to less striking 
conclusions. Portraiture, Mr. Norton sug- 
gests, has two possible modes, and but two : the 
embodiment of thought, as exemplified by the 
Greeks and Venetians, and the embodiment of 
action. Michael Angelo, though like Phidias 
in so many respects, and like him a supreme 
master, was less fortunate in his background, 
and his works are in the main monuments of 
thwarted purpose. The head of Athena from 
Gyrene, the work of a local sculptor, illus- 
trates how pervading were the fundamental 
characteristics of the Greek genius human- 
ism and directness. 

More promising are those portions of the 
book which are descriptive or scientific in their 
aim, the richly illustrated catalogues of Ber- 
nini's clay models and his designs for the 
Piazza of St. Peter's, and the two essays deal- 
ing with Giorgione. The sketch book for the 



1915]

81 



Piazza, to be sure, has been already twice pub- 
lished by foreign scholars, yet it might have 
been made to give up further secrets relative 
to the gradual development of the project in 
Bernini's mind. The author's idea, however, 
seems rather to have been merely to adduce 
the drawings as illustrations of Bernini's mys- 
ticism in conception, grandiose power, and 
care in study. For a similar purpose, appar- 
ently, the superb collection of sculptor 's mod- 
els owned by Mrs. Brandegee is illustrated and 
described without any study of their relations 
to the completed figures to which they corre- 
spond. 

It is the essays on Giorgione which most 
repay the scholar. They summarize the at- 
tributions made by previous writers, and 
attempt a new and corrected list of his works, 
based not only on a "combination of the best 
points of the work of these very differently 
endowed critics," but on personal acquaint- 
ance with the originals as intimate as theirs. 
Agreement or disagreement with his conclu- 
sions will depend mainly on one's principles 
of historical criticism. Mr. Norton reacts 
against what he considers an excessive atten- 
tion to externality and detail in Morelli's 
methods, at the same time protesting against 
Mr. Berenson's occasional affirmations of mys- 
tical faith. From a similar impressionism, in- 
deed, Mr. Norton is by no means free. In- 
stances could be multiplied from the book in 
hand of ascriptions made or denied without 
any assignment of logical grounds. Without 
pressing the argumentum ad hominem, how- 
ever, we may raise the question whether 
another method which Mr. Norton 'employs by 
preference is superior to those of his prede- 
cessors. It is based on the assumption that an 
artist postulated as great can never repeat 
himself, or fall below the standard established 
for him. Such a doctrine of infallibility, read- 
ily maintained in a case like that of Giorgione 
by casting doubt on the authenticity of every- 
thing inferior, falls to the ground in any case 
where a great number of works are authenti- 
cated, as in the case of Bernini. Mr. Norton 
has to deprecate among the known works of 
Bernini failures exactly similar to those which 
he cites as impossible in Botticelli and Gior- 
gione, yet to him Bernini is a master of coor- 
dinate rank and equal inspiration. Although 
his purgations of this sort are of doubtful 
value, Mr. Norton's suggestions on the posi- 
tive side must be very seriously considered. 
He adds to the list of Giorgione 's works the 
"Gypsy Madonna" in Vienna, ascribed to 
Titian, the "Pieta" of the Correr Museum 
(perhaps a copy), ascribed to Bellini, the 
"David and Solomon" in the National Gal- 



lery, ascribed to the school of Giorgione, and, 
under reserves, a portrait of a youth in 
Vienna (copy). For the "Madonna," espe- 
cially, he gives solid grounds for his belief, in 
an analysis which is a model for such discus- 
sions. 

The book is written with a positiveness of 
expression which may alienate those to whom 
its conclusions are unpalatable, but it is a posi- 
tiveness to be respected as the result of in- 
dependent study and personal conviction. 
Dwarfing the loose compilations on artistic 
subjects with which we have usually to con- 
tent ourselves in America, the book comes as a 
reassuring testimony of faith that painstaking 
scholarship and concentrated thought may 
still receive a hearing.

YOUNG OF THE " NIGHT THOUGHTS." * 



It is strange that a poet so popular and 
influential in his day as the author of ' ' Night 
Thoughts" should have had to wait a hundred 
and fifty years for an adequate biography in 
his own language. This has been the fate of 
Young; and therefore Mr. Shelley's substan- 
tial "Life and Letters of Edward Young" 
fills a real need. For the first time we have in 
English a full-length portrait of that "polite 
hermit and witty saint," as Mrs. Montagu 
called him. But there already existed in 
French an accurate and exhaustive study of 
Young's life and works, by W. Thomas, pub- 
lished at Paris in 1901. Incredible as it may 
seem, Mr. Shelley appears never to have heard 
of this admirable biography. If he had been 
able to consult it, he would have avoided a 
number of minor errors and some really 
serious ones, and could have filled certain gaps 
in his narrative. Thus he tells us (p. 2) that 
"one other child was born of the marriage" 
of Young's parents; Thomas shows from the 
parish records of Upham that Young had 
three sisters, two of whom, to be sure, died in 
childhood. Mr. Shelley, repeating earlier 
writers, says that Lady Young died in Janu- 
ary, 1741; Thomas cites an entry from the 
Welwyn parish register showing that she died 
January 29, 1739 or 1740. The mistake is 
serious, because upon the date of Lady 
Young's death depends the interpretation of 
a famous passage in the "Night Thoughts," 
involving the identification of the central 
characters, and, to some extent, the whole 
question of the sincerity of the poem. The 
matter is too complex to be discussed here; 
but it may be said that Mr. Shelley's wrong 

* LIFE AND LETTERS OF EDWARD YOUNG. By Henry C. Shel- 
ley. Boston: Little, Brown & Co. 



82 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1 



date leads him to suppose that Young left his 
wife in her last illness to pay a visit to the 
Duchess of Portland, and that he listened to 
the Duchess's suggestion of a second mar- 
riage at a date indecently near that of his 
wife's death. Mr. Shelley's friendliness to 
the poet causes him to gloss over these sup- 
posed delinquencies; but an examination of 
the Welwyn records would have shown him 
that Young needed no excuses. 

The great value of Mr. Shelley's biography 
of Young is in the abundance of new mate- 
rial which it presents, consisting chiefly of 
a series of letters from the poet to Margaret, 
Duchess of Portland. This correspondence 
covers the last twenty-five years of Young's 
life; it began in 1740, when the poet was 
fifty-seven and the Duchess twenty-five, and 
ended only a few weeks before his death in 
1765. The letters show Young at his best, as 
a man of the world, courtly, witty, and sensi- 
ble; deeply religious, and grave on occasion, 
but more often gay. Incidentally they give 
us a high opinion of the charm and goodness 
of the lady who inspired them. Her letters 
to Young are unfortunately lost; by the 
direction of his will, all his papers were 
destroyed. It is thus partly his own fault 
that he has waited so long for a biographer, 
and has been generally thought of as the mel- 
ancholy type of a "grave-yard poet." Mr. 
Shelley has very properly emphasized the 
other side of Young's temperament. We see 
the poet entertaining friends at his home, 
amusing the Duchess with lively stories, or 
rallying her on her failure to appreciate his 
friend Richardson's "Clarissa"; "your great- 
grandchildren," he tells her, "will read, and 
not without tears, the sheets that are now in 
the press." We see him at the age of sixty- 
two making friends with that aged butterfly, 
Colley Gibber, and delighting in his company. 
Reproached for this intimacy, he defends 
himself: "As for poor Colley, his impu- 
dence diverts me, and his morals shall not 
hurt me, though, by the way, he is more fool 
than knave, and like other fools is a wit." 
In another letter he complains humorously of 
the insincerity of one of his fair admirers: 
"Lady Andover does me honor in remember- 
ing that I exist. Yet 'tis all compliment; 
there is no sincerity, or she had not disap- 
pointed my assignation with her. Why go to 
town! Dishonorable creature! She is gone 
only with her husband!" Another letter of 
half- jocose moralizing ends as follows : ' ' Your 
Grace will wonder what all this means, and 
what gives occasion to such random stuff. 
Why, Madam, I am now in a coffee-house 
waiting for a rascally attorney, who, having 



robbed me already of all my money, would 
now rob me of my time; and rather than do 
nothing, which is very tedious, I was deter- 
mined to write nothing to your Grace." This 
is the Young of the satires, who could hit off 
so aptly the hypocritical church-goers : 
" And when their sins they set sincerely down, 
They'll find that their religion has been one," 

or the ignorant librarians : 

" Unlearned men of books assume the care, 
As eunuchs are the guardians of the fair." 

But Mr. Shelley does justice also to the 
serious Young, the Young of the '''Night 
Thoughts," who placed in his garden a 
"painted bench, a mere optical deceit." and 
inscribed on it the motto, "Invisibilia non 
decipiunt, ' ' 

As a portrait of the man Mr. Shelley's book 
is in many respects excellent. Apart from his 
inaccuracies as to fact his chief weakness is on 
the critical side. His estimate of Young's 
work is not always discriminating; for in- 
stance, he rates the turgid tragedies much too 
high. Little or nothing is said of literary 
influences on Young, and almost nothing of 
Young's own great influence. His popularity 
on the Continent, for example, signalized by 
translations into a dozen languages, is an ex- 
tremely interesting matter to which Mr. 
Shelley scarcely alludes. These are grave 
omissions; and here again the French study 
would have furnished invaluable aid. When 
all deductions are made, however, we must 
remain grateful to Mr. Shelley for his sym- 
pathetic and attractive portrait of a poet 
nowadays neglected, and above all for the 
delightful series of letters which he has made 
available. HOMER E. WOODBRIDGE. 



INTERPRETERS OF Mrsi< -.* 



That inspiring novel, "Jean Christophe," 
has given M. Romain Rolland an international, 
and, from present appearances, an enduring 
fame. He holds the chair of musical criticism 
in the Sorbonne and shares with his colleague, 
M. Combarieu, the foremost position in the 
ranks of writers on music in France. The 
present volume, which is admirably trans- 
lated by Miss Mary Blaiklock, is the initial 
publication of a series to be called "The Musi- 
cian's Bookshelf." M. Claude Landi, who 
furnishes an Introduction, gives some inter- 
esting biographical details of M. Rolland, who 
won, at the age of twenty-nine, the grand 
prix of the French Academy for a work on

and Scarlatti," and who has since gone on 
accumulating laurels until his place among the 
leading men in musical interpretation and 
literature is almost equivalent to a final and 
positive verdict of posterity. 

We have here a number of essays, some of 
which have seen the light before, dealing with 
the deeper aspects of music in Germany and 
France. One paper, however, is devoted to the 
Italian composer of oratorios, Don Lorenzo 
Perosi. The author attempts to some extent a 
comparison of recent German and French 
composers, and makes no very profound secret 
of his predilection for the men of his own land 
and time. This statement is not meant to be 
disparaging, but to indicate the point of view 
from which the work is written. Our author 
also seems to be an eloquent advocate of music 
with a programme as the highest form of 
music, a position which makes him something 
of a reactionary. This view may be a recoil 
from the extreme views of Wagner and 
Strauss, and is perhaps shared by many musi- 
cians of to-day; but it is always difficult to 
take the step backward, and history, after all, 
never repeats itself. 

The French composers of whom M. Holland 
speaks are Berlioz, Saint-Saens, d'Indy, and 
Debussy ; the German composers are Wagner, 
Strauss, and Hugo Wolf. He has a separate 
essay in which he compares German and 
French music; and there is an elaborate 
account of the musical movement in Paris 
since 1870, which he calls ' ' The Awakening, ' ' 
a title which leads to some consideration on 
the reader's part. The date 1870 has its con- 
notations, and one may ask oneself what may 
become of French and German music after the 
sinister years of 1914 and 1915. 

The essay on Berlioz is especially note- 
worthy. M. Holland is frank in revealing 
Berlioz's weakness of character, and in our 
opinion gives altogether too much attention to 
that side of the case. The close connection 
between character and achievement is indis- 
putable, but art has mostly to do with the lat- 
ter, and in the lapse of the years the misdoings 
of exceptional intelligences are lost in the 
record of service to the advancing destinies of 
the race. His view of Berlioz, and indeed his 
view of music as a whole, may be gathered 
from the following paragraphs : 

" Before Berlioz's time there was really only one 
master of the first rank who made a great effort to 
liberate French music; it was Rameau; and de- 
spite his genius, he was conquered by Italian art. 
By force of circumstances, therefore, French music 
found itself moulded in foreign musical forms 
as most men speak more than they think, even 
thought itself became Germanized, and it was diffi- 



cult to discover, through this traditional insin- 
cerity, the true and spontaneous form of French 
musical thought. But Berlioz found it by instinct. 
From the first he strove to free French music from 
the oppression of the foreign tradition that was 
smothering it." 

" Berlioz is thus the true inheritor of Beetho- 
ven's thought. The difference between a work 
like the 'Romeo and Juliette ' symphony of Berlioz 
and one of Beethoven's symphonies is that the 
former, it would seem, endeavors to express objec- 
tive emotions and themes in music. I do not see 
why music should not follow poetry in getting 
away from introspection and try to paint the 
drama of the universe. Shakespeare is as good as 
Dante. Besides, one may add, it is always Berlioz 
that may be discovered in his music ; it is his soul, 
starving for love and mocked at by shadows, which 
is revealed through all the scenes of Romeo." 

The above quotations indicate the trend of 
M. Holland's thought, and the method of his 
procedure. When he comes to treat of Ger- 
man music, it must be said at once that he is 
eminently just, and generous in his admira- 
tion. We may point to the essay on Hugo 
Wolf, in which genuine appreciation of the 
musician vies with sympathy for the un- 
toward fate which overwhelmed the great tal- 
ent at so many places and times in its career. 
In the comparison between French and Ger- 
man music, it must be conceded that his bias 
in favor of the music of his own country shows 
itself fully and clearly. Art, however, de- 
mands allegiance for its own sake, and it is 
certainly time that we should outgrow na- 
tional prejudices in matters of universal 
concern. Nobody talks about French mathe- 
matics ; why make so much of French hiusic, 
or German music, or Italian music? The 
realm of art is above national limitations, it is 
its own creator, its own arbiter, its own 
appreciator. In it we become conscious of 
universal humanity, and nations are like shad- 
ows of the night disappearing in the splendor 
of the daytime. In the essays on Strauss and 
Wagner we see reflected M. Holland's pre- 
disposition for the symphony with the pro- 
gramme; he finds it somewhat objectionable in 
Strauss when in the "Sinfonia Domestica" he 
omits the programme altogether, and he evi- 
dently prefers Wagner in the concert room to 
Wagner in the theatre. He says : 

" There are dilettanti who pretend that at a con- 
cert the best way to enjoy Beethoven's last works 
where the sonority is defective is to stop the 
ears and read the score. One might say with less 
of a paradox that the best way to follow a per- 
formance of Wagner's operas is to listen with the 
eyes shut, so perfect is the music, so powerful is its 
hold on the imagination that it leaves nothing to be 
desired ; what it suggests to the mind is infinitely 
finer than what the eyes may see. I have never

shared the opinion that Wagner's works may be 
best appreciated in the Theatre. His works are 
epic symphonies. As a frame for them I should 
like temples; as scenery, the illimitable land of 
thought; as actors, our dreams." 

We have no space to tell of the appreciation 
of d 'Indy, which is intense, or of the idealiza- 
tion of Debussy, who represents to M. Holland 
in their highest form some of the salient char- 
acteristics of the French, or of the sincere 
rhapsody on the theme of Saint-Saens. There 
is not a page of the book without arresting 
thought or insight; there is the enthusiasm of 
the genuine lover of his art; there is no un- 
reasoning admiration, but the analytical ten- 
dency of the modern critic. Coming from 
such a source, the book is, of course, authorita- 
tive, and to those who love music it will prove 
an opportunity to gain not only pleasure but 
an outlook fine and high. 

Mr. Lawrence Oilman's book, "Nature in 
Music," follows in the main the same direc- 
tion as M. Holland's. The first essay gives the 
title to the volume. It is a history of the 
growth of nature expression in music. Mr. 
Gilman says : 

" The strongest appeal of natural beauty has 
always, then, been chiefly to people of emotional 
habit, and especially to those of untrammeled 
imagination and non-conformist tendencies; in 
other words, to poetically minded radicals, in all 
times and regions. It is probable that the curious 
and enlightened enquirer, bearing in mind these 
facts, would not be surprised to find, in studying 
the various expressions of this attraction, as they 
are recorded in the arts, that the uniquely sensi- 
tive and eloquent art of music has long been the 
handmaid of the Nature lover; and he would be 
prepared to find the Nature lover himself appear- 
ing often in the guise of that inherently emotional 
and often heterodox being, the music maker." 

The transcriptions of nature in music date 
back to very early periods. The earlier at- 
tempts at nature description, however, were 
merely imitative or sentimental ; that is, they 
were subjective ; the painting of nature objec- 
tively belongs to recent times; the further 
advance to the use of nature expression as a 
symbol of spirit or intelligence, belongs to the 
latest composers, Debussy, MacDowell, Loeffler. 
An example of the earlier nature music is 
Mendelssohn's "Hebrides" overture, which 
gives us the emotions of the composer in view- 
ing natural scenery. An example of the later 
nature music is Debussy's "La Mer." 

The essay, while here and there amenable 
to the charge of being overburdened with lan- 
guage, gives, nevertheless, a really satisfac- 
tory view of the contention of music in the 
matter of nature transcription, and contains 
a strong defence of programme music, which is 



repeated in more than one other place in the 
book, showing how near the subject is to the 
author's heart, and how important he con- 
siders it. 

Mr. Gilman is evidently a mystic of the 
highest type. He has been a student of the 
oriental literatures, and he bathes his subject 
everywhere in the light which never was on 
land or sea. This gives a unique quality to 
his writing, and leads him everywhere to posi- 
tive conclusions. In an age of prevalent 
negation and materialistic nihilism, this is a 
fine faith and assurance. So in his essay on 
"Death and the Musicians" he makes; his 
climax with Schubert's "Death and the 
Maiden," Wagner's "Isoldens Liebestod" 
and Strauss 's "Tod und Verklarung," in all 
of which there is imaged a region wonderful, 
over which destroying time has no control. 

With the defence of Herr Hugo von Hoff- 
mannsthal as given in the essay on "Strauss 
and the Greeks," apropos of the modernized 
' ' Electra, ' ' we are less inclined to be satisfied. 
There is certainly no objection to poet or 
musician making such use of the myth as he 
sees fit, filling it with a modern significance 
and giving it splendors which it never had 
before. The utterance, musical or otherwise, 
belongs to him who does it best. But for the 
introduction of unnecessary disagreeable de- 
tails, and the lowering of tone in a drama 
there seems no adequate excuse. The music 
of Strauss, however, to the "Electra," is in 
the heaven of all its desires, "it is full of his 
typical qualities he never halts or fumbles ; 
he has a superb assurance. His mastery of 
his imaginative material and of his technic is 
absolute. ' ' 

Mr. Gilman has a reasonable word to say in 
regard to opera in English. He comes in gen- 
eral to the conclusion that an opera should be 
sung in the language which its composer gave 
to it. He considers this country lucky over 
European nations in that it can always hear 
an operatic work in the language in which it 
was produced. He instances the unhappy 
translations with which we are all familiar, 
in which the music does not fit the words ; he 
thinks that it is hopeless to expect that a talent 
spanning both music and words so completely 
as to be able to make a suitable translation 
could be induced to devote itself to so thank- 
less a task as the pouring of the liquor of 
thought from one vessel to another. It would 
be irresistibly led to creation, either in the 
drama or the opera. Therefore it behooves 
the English-speaking public to encourage the 
bringing forth of English operas which will 
have the importance of Wagner and Strauss 
and Debussy in their respective mediums.

We cannot close this notice without refer- 
ence to the essay called a "Musical Cosmopo- 
lite," which deals with the German- American 
composer, Mr. Charles Martin Loeffler, who, 
although born in Alsace, has done all his work 
in our own country, and takes place as an 
American composer, for which let us be duly 
thankful, as we have need of many recruits in 
the department of music. Mr. Loeffler has now 
found his place on programmes everywhere, 
and in the opinion of our author, is one of the 
greatest masters living to-day, with a message, 
sombre, perhaps, but high and noble, and with 
great control of musical resources. 

The book has some of the qualities of the 
music of which it treats; it has its enthusi- 
asms and its repugnances ; it is full of knowl- 
edge, both of music and literature ; it gives to 
music its place among the great and serious 
arts ; it recognizes that music, like every art, 
is expressive of the World Ideal ; and it must 
add to the genuine understanding of music 
wherever it is thoughtfully read.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 



Until the outbreak of war the nearer capitals of 
continental Europe held important colonies of 
American students, many of them youthfully eager 
and impecunious. Remoteness and growing differ- 
ences in standards between these temporary exiles 
and their fiction-reading compatriots at home sug- 
gest possible reasons why American writers have 
not utilized material so seemingly fitted for their 
purposes to any notable extent. It is, perhaps, as 
well, since it has remained for Mrs. Mary Roberts 
Rinehart to open the way with a book of unusual 
interest, " The Street of Seven Stars " (Hough- 
ton). The leading characters are an American 
girl, studying the art of the violin in Vienna, and a 
physician, her fellow-countryman, seeking wider 
knowledge. They are given the attributes we like 
to think of as American, satisfying admirably our 
idealists, though all suspicion of exaggeration is 
removed by the use of an eminently undesirable 
person or two and the sympathetic treatment of the 
Viennese introduced. A wide range of emotions is 
successfully depicted and the love story is tender 
-and true, and hopelessly impractical, as ideal love 
stories may well be. 

A refreshing novel, " Sons of the Rhine " (Des- 
mond FitzGerald), has been translated by Miss 
Louise T. Lazell from the German of Herr Rudolf 
Herzog's " Die Wiskottens." The scene is laid in 
the province of the Rhine where the valley of the 
river Wupper is given over to manufacturing, and 
the title of the work in the original is the family 
name of the manufacturers, a father, mother, and 
six sons, with whose fortunes the pages are con- 
cerned. The elder sons inherit the business abilities 
-of their parents, the founders of a growing ribbon 
factory, while the two younger are of poetic and 



artistic bent, and one intermediate is a scientist. 
The most aggressive of the number is wedded to a 
wife of tendencies which Americans will recognize 
as Puritan in the less worthy sense of the word, 
and her coldness leads to an estrangement which 
ends with her complete surrender to the facts of 
life as her husband lives it. The youngest boy 
makes an earlier failure as a painter after running 
away from home to study, but his designs for new 
ribbons go far toward saving the business from 
the effect of a relentless competition. It is one of 
those artificially artless stories in which everything 
that has been wrong turns right at the best possible 
moment, and is likely to appeal to a large follow- 
ing. The character studies are well done and the 
translation excellent, except for the numerous 
scriptural quotations, where Miss Lazell might 
have used the English authorized version to advan- 
tage. The book is free from militarism; indeed, 
from Germanism, with the exception of an extraor- 
dinary line from Von Moltke, " In its own strength, 
in that alone, lies the strength of a nation." The 
italics are the author's, and the sentiment fairly 
astounding. 

" Yourself and the Neighbours " (Devin-Adair) 
is made up of a series of brief descriptions of life 
in Ireland among the peasantry, chiefly among 
their small sons and daughters, written by Mr. 
Seumas MacManus and illustrated by Mr. Thomas 
Fogarty. As in others of Mr. MaeManus's books, 
the knowledge displayed has been gained at first 
hand, and is treated with complete comprehension 
and sympathy. The same may be said of the pic- 
tures, which lack nothing of the wit of the text. 
It is such stories as these that interpret racial spirit 
and bring to foreigners the assurance of a common 
humanity which is the truest internationalism. 

Excellent melodrama makes up Mr. J. C. 
Snaith's "Anne Feversham" (Appleton), a story 
of Elizabeth's time in which the author has had the 
daring to introduce Shakespeare and his theatrical 
associates as subordinate though important char- 
acters. A beautiful youth is condemned to death 
most unjustly. A lovely girl has just been soundly 
whipped by her irate father for disobedience and 
cast into a dungeon where she is neighbor to the 
beautiful youth. They effect their escape and have 
the most astonishing adventures, eventually falling 
in with the Lord Chamberlain's Players at Oxford, 
she disguised as a boy and both as gypsies. The 
part of Rosalind, which she had originally inspired, 
is created by her before the Queen, and a happy 
ending, virtue rewarded and vice rebuked, crowns 
the story. 

"The Place beyond the Winds" (Doubleday) 
is Mrs. Harriet T. Comstock's newest adventure in 
fiction. Its scene is laid near the Canadian border 
and its characters are tough pioneers and woods- 
men and their gentler teachers and offspring. The 
girl leaves a most unhappy home with her name 
under a cloud, and becomes a trained nurse in New 
York. Once there, the interest becomes largely 
medical and the most difficult of all problems con- 
fronting the practising physician she solves by cut- 
ting the knot. This divided interest does not add 
to the artistic value of the work, but it will surely 
serve the cause in which M. Brieux conceived and

wrote more than one of his plays. The characters 
of the book are strongly differentiated, and the 
narrative diversified enough to appeal to many 
tastes. Practically impossible as it is for the author 
to be more explicit in stating the terms of her 
problem, it strikingly lacks definition. 

Irony and hyperbole combine with a very pretty 
wit to make Mr. Stephen Leacock's "Arcadian 
Adventures of the Idle Rich" (Lane) that rare 
bird in contemporary English literature, a success- 
ful satire. The treatment of our plutocrats is 
episodic, though many of the characters appear in 
several of the tales. Nearly all of these are of pre- 
posterous wealth, which the men are striving to 
increase, only such persons of average possessions 
being admitted to the pages as tend to enhance the 
evidences of conspicuous waste. The reader will 
probably find the note rather shrill for continuous 
reading, much as the work deserves to be read. 
The merger of two fashionable churches, one Angli- 
can and the other Presbyterian, along the lines of 
the most approved methods of high finance is one 
of the best bits of witty sarcasm in recent print. 

The heroine of Mr. Dion Clayton Calthrop's 
"Clay and Rainbows" (Stokes) is about as disa- 
greeable a piece of feminine flesh as has appeared 
in recent fiction, quite degenerate, even to the point 
of suggesting that she would certainly be held a 
moron in any morals court. Incapable of con- 
stancy, she contrives to keep one fairly good man 
and several others who are not so good in a state of 
more or less complete unhappiness from one cover 
of the book to the other. Before the tale is com- 
pleted, not one of the characters has retained the 
reader's sympathy, being thoroughly committed as 
lacking in elementary morality, good taste, or com- 



mon sense. 



BRIEFS oisr NEW BOOKS. 



It is a curious and regrettable 

o! l s^te. artment fact that the g reat executive de- 
partments of our Federal Gov- 
ernment have not received from students and 
writers a measure of attention commensurate 
with their interest and importance, or in fair 
proportion to the amount of study which has 
been devoted to the presidency, the houses of 
Congress, or even the courts. Until very 
recently there was not one book in which the 
organization and working of any one of the 
departments was described adequately, for 
either the expert or the general reader. There 
is, of course, Ingersoll's "History of the War 
Department," Gushing 's "Story of Our Post 
Office," Swank's "Department of Agricul- 
ture," and Easby-Smith's "Department of 
Justice." not to enumerate a considerable list 
of histories of the navy. But all of these 
works (except that of Mr. Easby-Smith, pub- 
lished in 1904) are antiquated, or are mere 
popular sketches, or are histories rather than 
descriptive treatises. And the several excel- 



lent monographs which have been written 
upon various individual bureaus or adminis- 
trative services make no pretense of covering 
the field. To the student of political science, 
therefore (and doubtless to many people who 
lay no claim to such designation) , Mr. Gaillard 
Hunt's "The Department of State" (Yale 
University Press) is highly gratifying, first be- 
cause in its plan and execution it so closely ap- 
proximates the ideal piece of work of its kind, 
and secondly because the preparation of it has 
fallen to a writer of such exceptional qualifi- 
cations. For many years- Mr. Hunt occupied 
the post of chief of the Bureau of Citizenship 
in the State Department, and his knowledge 
of the Department is the product not only of 
prolonged and painstaking historical investi- 
gation but of personal observation and of act- 
ive participation in the Department's activi- 
ties. His book is technical rather than popular 
in character, and it is at the same time histori- 
cal and descriptive. It is not a history of 
diplomacy, or a series of biographical sketches 
of the secretaries of state. It abounds, fur- 
thermore, in lengthy citations from laws, cir- 
culars, and regulations. But, as the author 
rightly says, these documentary passages tell 
the story more accurately than a paraphrase 
could do, and unquestionably their use will 
contribute to a realization of the expressed 
desire to make the book, so far as it goes, defini- 
tive. The first three chapters recount suc- 
cinctly the history of the varying arrange- 
ments made for the conduct of foreign affairs 
by the Continental Congress and by the Con- 
gress of the Confederation, supplementing ad- 
mirably the chapters of Mr. Learned in his 
"President's Cabinet" dealing with the gen- 
eral administrative aspects of the period, and 
leaving apparently little or nothing further 
to be said. Two chapters are devoted to the 
creation and organization of the State Depart- 
ment in 1789, two others to the functions once 
exercised by the Department but now with- 
drawn, together with those which are still 
exercised only on occasion, and two more to 
the Department's past and present internal 
organization. Seven chapters serve for an 
analytical discussion of the Department's 
present functions. And the volume closes 
with an interesting account of the buildings 
and rooms utilized for the work of the Depart- 
ment throughout the past century and a quar- 
ter. With respect to the allotment of space 
one criticism only may be suggested. The 
diplomatic and consular services are covered 
together in a single chapter of but twenty 
pages. More space might well have been given 
them, even at the sacrifice of some details pre- 
sented upon other and less important subjects.

A British 
admiral's 
retrospect. 



Caustic comment from Admiral 
Lord Charles Beresford on naval 
and other matters of current 
interest has obtained some publicity of late, 
and shows him to be as incisive in speech as 
he has proved himself unhesitating and vigor- 
ous in action during his long and distinguished 
service afloat and ashore, in the navy and in 
parliament, and in whatever rank or capacity 
it has been his lot to serve his country. In ' ' The 
Memoirs of Admiral Lord Charles Beresford" 
(Little, Brown & Co.) he does not fail to 
reveal a mastery of his native tongue such as 
few sailors can claim. Very early in his sea- 
faring life, which began when he was but thir- 
teen years old, he demonstrated the sufficiency 
of his vocabulary in an amusing manner. He 
was asked to be coxswain of a racing crew 
belonging to the "Marlborough," the first ship 
of war to which he was assigned as naval 
cadet, and the invitation was extended in 
these words by the spokesman of the deputa- 
tion entrusted with the business : ' ' Well, sir, 
it's like this here, sir, if you'll pardon me. 
Yew be young-like, and what we was thinking 
was whether you have the power of language 
that du be required. " "I said I would do my 
best," relates the one thus honored. "I did. 
I astonished myself." In his enthusiasm for 
his calling, he rises almost to the realm of 
poetry in an early chapter, which opens thus : 
"I wish I could convey to my readers some- 
thing of the pride and delight which a sailor 
feels in his ship. But who that has never had 
the luck to be a deep-water sailor, can under- 
stand his joy in the noble vessel, or the uplift- 
ing sense of his control over her matchless and 
splendid power, born of a knowledge of her 
every rope and sail and timber, and of an 
understanding of her behavior and ability. 
For every ship has her own spirit, her own 
personality." Admiral Beresford comes of 
illustrious and gallant Irish stock, one mem- 
ber of which, Admiral Sir John Poo Beres- 
ford, achieved both unusual glory and uncom- 
mon length of years, dying in 1884 at the ex- 
treme age of one hundred and sixteen. Lord 
Charles himself, as we learn, but not from his 
own narrative, has in the course of his strenu- 
ous life broken his breast-bone and parted 
with a piece of it, broken his right leg, right 
hand, right foot, five ribs, one collar-bone 
three times, the other once, his nose three 
times, and one of the bones of the pelvis ; but 
though he was in youth marked for an early 
grave by the wiseacres, his energy of will has 
carried him through to a well-preserved ma- 
turity, for not yet can he be called old, being 
still on the sunny side of seventy. His two- 
volume autobiography is packed with events 



of interest, sometimes of thrilling interest, and 
often of great historic importance. His life 
is, in very truth, a part of his country's his- 
tory. Mr. L. Cope Cornford provides the book 
with useful Introduction and notes, and many 
illustrations are interspersed. 



The life of 

a great singer. 



There is an undeniable fascina- 
tion about the men and women 
who have won a prominent place 
in the theatre, where we go to see life moving 
before us in a sort of dream. The applause 
which they receive, the splendor in which they 
appear, the idealization which we give to their 
character and attainments, set them apart 
from the ordinary human being, and give 
interest to them in every aspect in which they 
manifest themselves. We like especially to 
know about them as simple human beings, and 
an opportunity to gaze into their daily life 
away from the glamour of the stage is gladly 
seized upon. Madame Lilli Lehmann Kalisch 
in her book, "My Path through Life" (Put- 
nam), presents us with an autobiography 
singularly minute and agreeable. She begins 
with her girlhood days and passes on to the 
period of her extraordinary triumphs, when 
she was almost without question the greatest 
singer of her time. Her book shows her to be 
a woman of remarkable insight and intelli- 
gence; her aims are, and have been, as high 
as those of the art which she made grander 
and nobler by her efforts ; w r e doubt whether 
any singer ever lived who brought to her art 
sincerer devotion. Lilli Lehmann came of a 
musical family. Her mother, Marie Loew, 
was a distinguished singer in opera, and her 
father, Carl August Lehmann, was one of the 
famous tenors of his day. The father proved 
a wayward person and his death released the 
family from considerable embarrassment. 
The mother, who had left the stage, became 
harpist in the orchestra of the theatre in 
Prague, and maintained herself and two 
daughters thus, and by giving lessons in sing- 
ing. Both girls followed their mother in their 
careers, and Lilli Lehmann seems to think that 
her sister Marie was a greater artist than her- 
self. The account of these youthful days is 
very entertaining, and the young girls soon 
had many chances of appearing in public, 
securing thus an education which subse- 
quently proved invaluable to them. Richard 
Wagner comes into their life very early. He 
was a friend of the mother, and at one time 
made a serio-comic proposition for the adop- 
tion of Lilli. After some effort a professional 
engagement for the elder daughter Lilli was 
obtained at the Prague National Theatre, and 
the life-work began in earnest. The book will 



88 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 1 



be found enjoyable by musicians and laymen 
alike ; for it is the story of a grand woman and 
a great artist at her best. The translation by 
Mrs. Alice Benedict Seligman is in the main 
well done and the portraits and other illustra- 
tions add to the value of the book. 



The mind 

of Dostoievsky. 



Miss Ethel Colburn Mayne's 
translation of the "Letters of 
Dostoevsky" (Macmillan) is a 
book that will interest all admirers of the Rus- 
sian novelist. The letters contain much that 
our reading of the novels had prepared us for 
and a little that was less to be expected. The 
extraordinary preoccupation of the young 
Dostoieffsky with European literature, for 
example, will be somewhat surprising to many 
of his American readers. On the other hand, 
his characteristic enthusiasms are set down 
here at the greatest length, with a fullness, 
indeed, that is a little trying to the patience. 
He was the most fanatical of Slavophils, find- 
ing little to admire and much to condemn in 
the civilizations of the West. He was a mystic 
in politics as in religion, and the efficiency of 
modern Germany desolated his soul, while 
France seemed to him decadent and immoral. 
The hope of European civilization appeared to 
him to lie in ' ' holy Russia, ' ' though he found 
it difficult to convey this hope in intelligible 
terms. His unfortunate quarrel with Tour- 
guenieff was intensified by the latter 's con- 
tempt for Russian pretensions. Throughout 
the letters, as in the novels, one is struck by 
the singular confusion that characterized; 
Dostoieffsky as thinker. His grasp of abstract 
ideas was always uncertain, and he was never 
able to discipline himself by a rational con- 
sideration of any subject that had deeply 
engaged his sympathy. The letters, although 
illuminating to those already familiar with the 
novels, should not be read as an introduction 
to Dostoieffsky 's works; they should be read 
only by those who have already gained some 
knowledge of the strength and the weakness of 
the man who wrote them. 



w . . 

Wonders and 

riches of the 



Enamoured of our youthful and 

. ^ . ,-, i i 

vigorous Far West, though him- 
self a resident of the effete East, 
Mr. E. Alexander Powell, F.R.G.S., writes 
with both enthusiasm and knowledge concern- 
ing the manifold attractions and possibilities 
of the vast domain stretching from the Mexi- 
can border to Puget Sound, and even beyond, 
to the Alaskan boundary line. This region he 
has traversed in a motor-car, being, he be- 
lieves, the first to make the journey in that 
manner. ' ' The End of the Trail ' ' ( Scribner ) , 
describes in vivid style and with a wealth of 



pictorial accompaniment the incidents of the 
undertaking, with such items of geographical 
and agricultural and miscellaneous informa- 
tion as naturally include themselves in a nar- 
rative of this kind. Especially impressive is 
the change recently wrought in the desert 
regions of the Southwest by the introduction 
of artificial irrigation, whereby the sandy 
wastes of New Mexico and Arizona are made 
to develop unsuspected fertility and the face 
of nature is marvellously transformed. Mr. 
Powell's chapter-headings indicate the tone of 
his book; he chooses such picturesquely de- 
scriptive captions as "Conquerors of Sun 
and Sand," "Chopping a Path to To-mor- 
row," "The Land of Dreams-Come-True," 
"Where Gold Grows on Trees," "The Coast 
of Fairyland," and "The Valley of Heart's 
Delight." Allowing himself a sufficiency of 
rhetorical exuberance to preserve his style 
from dullness, he perhaps carries to excess the 
familiar devices of exaggeration and allitera- 
tion, as where he describes 1 the road from 
Phoenix to the Roosevelt Dam, which he calls 
' ' the trail of a thousand thrills, ' ' and says 
' ' its right-angle corners and hairpin turns are 
calculated to make the hair of the motorist 
permanently pompadour." This last expres- 
sion is a favorite of his in emphasizing the 
startling character of far-western scenery. As 
in his preceding volume, "The Last Fron- 
tier," the author gives evidence of much expe- 
rience as a "gentleman rover" (to use a term 
of his own) and an alert observer. There is a 
wealth of entertainment and information in 
his pages.

bear to individual attitude and social policy. 
The second series of lectures, "Biology and 
Social Problems," was given by Professor 
G. H. Parker of Harvard and they admirably 
carry out both in letter and spirit the purpose 
of the enterprise. The first lecture deals with 
the fundamental conceptions and discoveries 
of modern biology regarding the structure and 
action of the nervous system, in its relation to 
reflexes, freedom, and memory. The second 
concerns itself with the secretions of the duct- 
less glands and those mysterious chemical sub- 
stances known as hormones, which profoundly 
affect and control the activities of organs, de- 
velopmental processes, and secondary sexual 
characters. The third lecture discusses the

duction and heredity and their practical ap-

plication in genetics. The closing lecture is a 
conservative estimate of the present status of 
our knowledge of the factors of organic evolu- 
tion, consisting of a frank recognition of the 
profound inadequacy of our present proved 
ground, a relegation of Darwin 's natural selec- 
tion to a place of secondary importance, and a 
confident belief that experiment and analysis 
will ultimately place in man's hands a fuller 
knowledge of the factors which have brought 
about his existence. Lucidity, definite prog- 
ress to conclusions, frankness, and breadth of 
view characterize this book and make it one of 
the best brief statements of current biological 
thought so far published for the general 
reader. (Houghton Mifflin Co.) 



Sir Walter 
Raleigh and 
Shakespeare. 



A person who believes that Sir 
Walter Raleigh wrote Shake- 
speare's plays is not quite so 
crazy as a Baconian. Raleigh had far more 
than Bacon of the Elizabethan versatility ; he 
had also more imagination, and a very pretty 
talent for poetry. Still no one with any sensi- 
tiveness to style could suppose that the author 
of "Give me my scallop-shell of quiet" could 
have written the tragedy of Lear or "The 
Tempest." Nothing so imponderable as lit- 
erary quality, however, is noticed by Mr. 
Henry Pemberton, Jr., in his "Shakespere 
and Sir Walter Raleigh" (Lippincott). He 
applies, as he tells us in his Preface, methods 
to which he has ' ' been accustomed in the study 
of physical sciences. ' ' Perhaps it is this scien- 
tific training which leads him to find profound 
significance in the fact that on the title-pages 
of some early editions the name of the author 
is spelled with a hyphen, "Shake-speare." 
Surely it is not the scientific method which 
leads Mr. Pemberton to repeat from Charles 
Kingsley an outrageous calumny on Richard 
Burbage, based on a passage from one of 
Jonson 's masques ; for if Mr. Pemberton had 
looked up the reference, even he must have 
seen that Kingsley entirely misunderstood the 
passage. In justice to Mr. Pemberton, how- 
ever, it should be said that he discovers no 
acrostics or cryptograms, but relies for his 
evidence upon a number of "topical allu- 
sions" in the plays and sonnets, which can be 
explained as referring to various circum- 
stances in Raleigh's life. Some of these ex- 
planations are neat and by themselves plausi- 
ble. But the book exhibits beautifully the 
three fundamental weaknesses characteristic 
of its class. Practically all such books are 
based in great part upon (1) a literary stu- 
pidity which cannot distinguish between 
sharply contrasted styles, (2) a form of snob- 
bishness which, in defiance of literary history, 



assumes that no work of the highest merit can 
be done by an author of obscure social stand- 
ing and irregular education, and (3) an 
encyclopaedic ignoring of all the facts which 
do not fit into the writer 's theory. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"The Short Story" (McClurg), by Professor 
E. A. Cross of the State Teachers' College of 
Colorado, is a well selected collection of eighteen or 
twenty prose narratives with an Introduction and 
brief notes. Unlike many recent books on the 
same subject it gives no directions to the pros- 
pective writer of short stories, but aims to help the 
thoughtful reader to a better understanding of 
this literary form. 

Five new volumes in the Greek section of the 
" Loeb Classical Library " have come to hand, as 
follows : the second and final volume of Mr. Walter 
Miller's translation of Xenophon's " Cyropaedia," 
two volumes of a ten-volume translation of 
" Plutarch's Lives " by Mr. Bernadotte Perrin, the 
first volume of Mr. H. B. Dewing's translation of 
Procopius, and the third volume of Mr. E. Gary's 
translation of Dio's Roman history. 

" The South African Year Book, 1914," edited 
by Mr. W. H. Hosking and published by Messrs. 
E. P. Button & Co., is the first issue of an annual 
publication of collated information regarding the 
Union of South Africa. The data have been 
secured from official sources, chiefly from the 
Union, Provincial, German, and Portuguese gov-

THE DIAL 



[ Feb. 1 



A book by M. Emile Verlmeren, " The Belgian 
Spirit," is announced by Messrs. Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

Mr. W. B. Maxwell's new novel, " The Ragged 
Messenger," will be published immediately by 
Messrs. Bobbs-Merrill Co. 

A play by Mr. Edward Sheldon, " The Garden of 
Paradise," and one by Mr. Israel Zangwill, 
" Plaster Saints," will be published immediately by 
the Macmillan Co. 

" James," a novel by " W. Dane Bank " which 
was announced in the autumn but which was de- 
layed, will be published immediately by Messrs. 
George H. Doran Co. 

Mr. Cecil Chesterton, brother of Mr. G. K. Ches- 
terton, has written " The Prussian Has Said in His 
Heart,'.' which Mr. Laurence J. Gomme announces 
for publication on this side. 

A novel by Mr. Booth Tarkington, " The 
Turmoil," which has been running serially in 
" Harper's Magazine," is announced for publica- 
tion on February 11 by Messrs. Harper & Brothers. 

Mr. Henry Sydnor Harrison's new story, 
"Angela's Business," which is being published 
serially in the " Metropolitan Magazine " will be 
issued in book form shortly by Messrs. Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

Four new volumes of the " Home University 
Library " will be published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. next week. They are : " The Navy and the 
Sea Power," by Mr. David Hannay ; " The Ancient 
East," by Mr. D. G. Hogarth; "The Negro," by 
Mr. W. E. DuBois; and "Russian Literature," by 
Mr. Maurice Baring. 

Mr. Samuel Parsons is the author of " The Prin- 
ciples and Practice of Landscape Gardening," 
which Messrs. Putnam announce for immediate 
publication. The book is understood to be an 
attempt to state a theory of landscape gardening 
and contains a considerable body of matter from 
foreign writers on the subject whose work has not 
hitherto been translated into English. 

Professor Leo Wiener of Harvard is the author of 
"An Interpretation of the Russian People " which 
will be published shortly by Messrs. McBride, Nast 
& Co. Professor Wiener was born in Russia and 
spent his youth there. Since he came to America he 
has taught in a number of schools and colleges. He 
is the translator and editor of an edition of Tol- 
stoi's complete works. Altogether his experience 
should have qualified him in a peculiar degree to 
explain Russia to America. 

Katharine Coman, professor emeritus of eco- 
nomics and sociology at Wellesley College, died on 
January 11. Miss Coman was called to the chair 
of history at Wellesley in 1883, shortly after her 
graduation from the University of Michigan. In 
1900 she became professor of economics. Ill health 
compelled her to retire from active teaching in 
1913. Miss Coman was the author of " The Growth 
of the English Nation," an " Industrial History of 
the United States," and " The Economic Begin- 
nings of the Far West." 



A circular to members of the Fifth International 
Congress of Philosophy which was to have been 
held in London next September announces that the 
war has made it impossible to carry through the 
arrangements for the meeting. The members of the 
organizing committee express " the earnest hope 
that the confederacy of the entire philosophical 
world, which has subsisted since the inauguration of 
the series of congresses in 1900, will not be set 
aside for a longer time than untoward circum- 
stances render absolutely imperative." 

A " College of Arts " especially for American 
students is announced in London. Among those 
who have promised to conduct classes are Mr. and 
Mrs. Arnold Dolmetsch, Mr. Gaudier-Brzeska, Mr. 
Wyndham Lewis, Mr. Reginald Wilenski, Mr. 
Alvin Langdon Coburn, Mr. Edmond Dulac, Mr. 
Charles T. Jacobi, and Mr. Ezra Pound. Besides 
sculpture, painting, music, dancing, and literature, 
it is proposed to teach crafts, including printing, 
bookbinding, furniture-making, and work in silver, 
enamel, and pottery. The secretary is Mr. Vaughn 
Baron, 5 Holland Place Chambers, Kensington, 
London, W. 

James Elroy Flecker, who died recently at Davos 
Platz after a long illness, was one of the most dis- 
tinguished of the younger English poets. The 
author of several volumes of verse, he was best 
known by the collections entitled " Forty-two 
Poems " and " The Golden Journey to Samarkand." 
A novel, " The King of Alsander," was published 
in this country only last autumn. A wanderer, a 
student of Oriental languages, a resident for a 
considerable period of Stamboul, Flecker was not 
intimately associated with any of the three or four 
groups of poets in London. Poems of his were, 
however, included in " Georgian Poetry," the brief 
anthology which introduced his name and that of 
Mr. Rupert Brooke in connection with those of 
Mr. T. Sturge Moore and other men of more estab- 
lished reputation.

Chaucer and His Poetry. By GEORGE 
LYMAN KITTREDGE. Litt.D., LL.D., Professor of 

English in Harvard University. Svo. Cloth. 230 pages . $1.25 net. 

An interpretation of Chaucer as a humanist, and 
therefore significant to all ages. Prof. Kittredge has 
brought to it the full mellowness of his scholarship, 
and a lively and appreciative humor that casts many 
new lights on the greatest of English narrative poets.

CHANDLER RATHFON POST, Ph.D., Assistant Pro- 
fessor of Greek and the Fine Arts in Harvard University. 12mo. 
Cloth. 320 pages. $2.25 net. 

The development of Castilian allegory from its 
appearance in the vernacular of the thirteenth century 
to its culmination in the fifteenth showed more inde- 
pendence than has yet been recognized. Among the 
objects of this volume is to disprove borrowing from the 
Italian usually attributed to Imperial and his followers.

ERNEST BERNBAUM, Ph.D., Instructor in English in 
Harvard University. Sve. Cloth. 106 pages. $1.00 net. 

The career of the once famous adventuress, Mary 
Carleton, is not without lively human interest in 
itself; but the especial value of this study lies in its 
disclosure that her supposed biography is in reality 
a novel, anticipating the journalistic methods of 
Daniel Defoe. This discovery explodes the doctrine 
that the art of serious realistic fiction was not prac- 
ticed in the restoration period.

THE THREE-PLY THEE AD OF LIFE. 

Mankind is always within six months of 
starvation, and therefore it must work that 
is, act. And when it gets a day off and turns 
to play it generally chooses a play of action. 
Action is as universal as the casing air. . And 
this action, the action of stokers and steve- 
dores, of locomotive firemen and ironworkers, 
of doctors facing contagious disease or lawyers 
fighting graft and injustice, of women in 
childbirth or the charge of families,- is full 
of heroism and dignity. Nine-tenths of us, 
probably, deserve the Iron, Cross. But the 
decoration would have no value if so profusely 
bestowed. We have to have representatives in 
glory. Real distinction in the active life is 
only for the chosen of a few favored classes. 

Thucydides, describing the return of Bra- 
sidas, the Spartan general, , after a victorious 
expedition, says: "He was received almost as 
if he had been an athlete. ' ' "We suppose that 
the player who kicks a goal or makes a home 
run does receive applause more tumultuous 
and dizzying than falls to the lot of any other 
mortal. But the fame of a Brasidas is rather 
more permanent. Of all men of action, in- 
deed, the final and most satisfying -award goes 
to the soldier. Statues are erected for them, 
histories are written around them, they live in 
legend and the memory of the people. The 
world recognizes that they risk more than other 
men, and as a rule from more unselfish mo- 
tives. Generals of course do not to-day lead 
picturesque charges ; but before they get to be 
generals they have to chance their lives again 
and again. They are the most concentrated 
examples of that heroism which is the ideal -of 
the race. Explorers, discoverers, pioneers of 
various kinds, deserve to and do attract the 
admiration of mankind. 

Statesmen are far less deep in our affec- 
tions. For one thing their actions are not so 
open and straightforward. They mine like 
moles in the dark. For another thing, they are 
a protected class, and do not much risk life or 
limb. But they have great issues in their 
hands, and genius and devotion will make 
their memories sacred. Opportunity, how- 
ever, plays a great part in their success. We 



102 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16 



are all potentially politicians. Probably every 
third man one meets on Broadway or Chestnut 
street would make a tolerably decent Presi- 
dent of the United States. As they say of 
Hamlet, the part plays itself. The nation 
speaks and acts through its representative. 

It is a mere truism to say that the men of 
action are the servants of the men of thought. 
The contemplators, the meditative minds, are 
the real dynamos that move the world. They 
are the earthquakes, the volcanoes, which 
every now and then break up the crust of 
formulas that is always tending to thicken 
over human life. Gautama, profoundly dis- 
satisfied with his palace and his princeship, 
puts on the yellow robe, takes up the begging 
bowl, and becomes a guide to a quarter of the 
human race. Christ, born in a manger, con- 
fronts the Roman Empire, and in time it van- 
ishes before him. Socrates, amid the most 
brilliant civilization the world has ever known, 
starts questionings about the soul and the good 
of life which after a while tumble that civ- 
ilization down. Luther looks at the Roman 
Catholic creation of Europe and sees that it is 
not good, and it is shaken by his breath. Rous- 
seau sees the horror of the ancien regime and 
finds watchwords and formulas for the new 
age. The latest example of a thinker's power 
has been so much discussed that it is hardly 
worth while to advert to it, except to say that 
it is a revolt against Rousseau's revolt. The 
doctrines of liberty and equality had been car- 
ried so far that it seemed to him time for the 
ideas of rule and superiority to assert them- 
selves. 

All these thinkers drew after them vast 
agitations, changes, revolutions. Probably 
more than half the wars which the historic 
world has known can be directly traced to 
them or their like. The struggles between the 
Eastern and Western Roman Empire, the 
Mohammedan invasions, the Crusades, the 
Thirty Years' War, the French Revolution and 
Napoleonic Wars, all these conflicts and many 
more received their impetus from thinkers 
who desired only the good of man. 

And undoubtedly they have wrought his 
good. The clash of ideas and ideals has kept 
humanity fluid. Even if it could be cast in a 
mould of perfection, that would only be a liv- 
ing death. But full of imperfection as it is, 
too much rest means decay and degeneration. 
If the ocean were still it would stagnate ; but 
the winds and waves that send ships to the 



bottom, and eat away the confining coasts, 
keep the waters salt and sweet. 

The thinkers, then, are at once destroyers 
and saviors. The destruction they work is so 
frightful that men instinctively sense them, 
before their theories get into operation, and 
offer them the cross, the hemlock, the prison 
cell. If they escape these things it is because 
they seem so harmless that their fellows think 
them of no account. Mrs. Darwin once called 
her cook into consultation to provide some 
dainty to tempt her husband's appetite, which 
was failing. "Begging your pardon, Mum, 
but if Mr. Darwin would do a little work he 
would have an appetite. " ' ' But Mr. Darwin 
does work," objected her mistress. "Him 
work ! ' ' said the cook. ' ' Why, I see him with 
my own eyes this morning sitting for two 
hours in the garden, looking at an anthill." 
The only work Darwin did was to tear down 
the dam-wall of tradition and let out on the 
world a ravaging, but possibly a fertilizing, 
flood. 

But we cannot be soldiers in the war of ideas 
all the time. We must have rest, recreation, 
happiness. There must come halcyon days, 
hours of charm and effortless exaltation. And 
that is what the creative minds give us. 
Theirs is an almost flawless bestowal. Shake- 
speare does not declare war, Rembrandt does 
not bombard cathedrals, Beethoven does not 
starve out populations. They give us the keys 
to another world, a world enough like ours 
to be intelligible to us, but fairer, more glo- 
rious, more perfect, and infinitely more amus- 
ing. And our residence in that world is not 
merely a refined kind of lotus-eating, which 
lifts us up as gods for the moment only to drop 
us back on the hard stones of reality ; it is not 
only "the world's sweet inn of rest from 
troublesome annoy"; no, it is a school of 
virtue. The precepts of the prophets do not 
really do us as much good as the examples of 
the poets. The great, the magnificent, the 
lovely, are there for us to admire and imitate ; 
and the evil, the horrible, the grotesque, are 
there for us to avoid or laugh at. All art must 
have its shadow to make its light stand out. 
The deeper the shadow the more vivid the 
light ; but it is the light which attracts. 

Being so rich and almost blameless in their 
gifts to man, one should think that the poets 
in words and sounds and colors and forms 
would be welcomed, or at least would escape 
being stoned as the prophets are. But the 



1915] 



103 



generality of them are starved in life and pur- 
sued with malignant rancor after death. 
What fables are existent about Shakespeare 
and Moliere! What pitiful picayune gossip 
about Coleridge and Shelley and Poe and Car- 
lyle! The eternal whipper-snapper is like 
Gulliver perched upon the shoulder of Glum- 
dalclitch, and only sees rugosities and sores in 
what to equal eyes is the complexion of health 
and goodness. The hand of mediocrity gravi- 
tates inevitably towards the mud. Anything 
shining only attracts it as a target. The 
scandal-mongers ought to have their mouths 
washed out with soap and an odorless excava- 
tor put to work on their minds. 

It is a three-ply existence which we possess, 
and we ought not to follow exclusively any one 
of the strands. Absolute devotion to the active 
life brings us out at a pretty low level of intel- 
ligence. The contemplative mood is divorced 
from practicality, and is likely to make us 
persecute and kill one another because of dif- 
ferences of opinion on points of theology or 
about the summum bonum. We can lose our- 
selves in art; but there, too, we get out of 
touch with reality, and lacking knowledge of 
the world will not even know what is good art. 
The wise thing is to exercise all our facul- 
ties; but unfortunately in order to do any- 
thing important we must concentrate. We 
must save all our oil for one lamp. Hence the 
men of action will continue to persecute the 
prophets whom sooner or later they must obey ; 
and both will brush aside the creative artists 
who do the least harm, and who add some- 
thing of permanent value to the common stock 



of the world. 



CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



POETRY AND EFFICIENCY dare we name the 
two in the same breath, or even on the same 
day? And will the poet and his dream ever 
be subjected to the indignity of the efficiency 
test, ever be brought so low as to have their 
efficiency curve plotted by some efficiency ex- 
pert? Heaven forbid! Yet in these days 
when economics, linguistics, ethics, and even 
politics, are being brought into line with 
mathematics and the other exact sciences, can 
one hope that poetics will escape the general 
doom ? Already, if we mistake not, some ambi- 
tious candidate for a Ph.D. degree has devoted 
a laborious thesis to the discovery of an alge- 
braic formula that shall express the degree of 
emotional effectiveness in any given piece of 



poetry. A keen observer of the spread of effi- 
ciency standards in all departments of human 
activity gave an address, not devoid of humor, 
before a recent gathering of educators. From 
this address, now printed in "The School 
Review," a brief passage is pertinent here. 
Professor Fred Newton Scott is the speaker. 
"In every field of knowledge in economics, 
in psychology, in linguistics, in sociology, in 
ethics, in short in all the looser- woven 'ics' 
and 'ologies' somebody is setting the screws 
a little harder. In every one of these depart- 
ments of instruction some stern, wall-eyed 
thinker, rising stiffly and frowning upon his 
shamefaced colleagues, has announced that in 
his book or brochure or syllabus the subject 
has at last been elevated to the status of mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, and astronomy. 
Nay, even in such irresponsible, Ariel-like 
subjects as literature, music, and the arts gen- 
erally, the same motive is seen at work. 
Within the past few years a book by the 
brother of an eminent scientist, himself a 
scientist of some note, professes to have raised 
to the dignity of an exact science the whole 
subject of poetry." This evidently refers to 
Mr. Hudson Maxim's work, "The Science of 
Poetry and the Philosophy of Language." 
But it is not too much to hope that the Ariel- 
like spirit of poetry will not be found to have 
been caught and imprisoned for all time 
within the definitions and rules of that scien- 
tific treatise. 



A PLEA FOR LIBRARY SUPPORT is put f Orth in 

what should prove an eloquently persuasive 
form by the administrative officers of the Chi- 
cago Public Library. It brings to prominent 
notice some significant facts not very credita- 
ble to those who have the apportionment of the 
city's annual income. Spending last year only 
1.26 per cent of its total tax receipts on its 
public library, while in the same period it 
spent, wisely enough, nearly fifty per cent on 
its schools, Chicago is found to rank, in respect 
to library support, with cities having approxi- 
mately only one quarter of its population and 
area. In other words, Boston and Cleveland, 
in proportion to their size, are four times as 
liberal in their treatment of their public 
libraries. But even with its present inade- 
quate resources the Chicago institution man- 
ages to take no lower than second place, among 
our ten largest cities, in its circulation of 
books and in the number of library-users. 
The number of volumes that it owns, however, 
places it third in a similar scale of rank, while 
in the number of volumes per inhabitant it 
stands at the foot, and in the per capita cost 
of its library service, under the present parsi- 



104 



THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16 



monious policy, it holds the same unenviable 
position. In its number of branch library 
buildings the city likewise leads the class at 
the lower end. The shame of Chicago may be 
stated in still other and more definite terms, if 
the foregoing be not humiliating enough. In 
a table of annual per capita expenditures for 
library purposes embracing the same ten larg- 
est cities, we find Pittsburg heading the list 
with fifty- three cents for each inhabitant, Bos- 
ton following as a close second with fifty-one 
cents. New York coming fifth with thirty- 
three cents, and the metropolis of the middle 
West contenting itself with the last place and 
an expenditure of but fifteen cents for each 
member of its population. The whole situa- 
tion is put graphically before one. by means of 
diagrams with accompanying figures, in the 
printed appeal referred to above. It ought to 
succeed in starting something, to the benefit of 
the third largest public library in America 
and its long-suffering users. 


BATTLES AND BOOKS represent two very dif- 
ferent kinds of human activity so different, 
in fact, as to be mutually antagonistic. Nev- 
ertheless, as is shown by the "Publishers' 
Circular" in a review of England's book-pro- 
duction for the year recently closed, it is not 
impossible for a powerful nation to carry on 
warfare and publication at the same time. 
For the twelve months there was a decrease of 
less than seven per cent, as compared with the 
preceding twelve months, in book-publishing, 
or a fall from 12,379 to 11,537; and in the 
rather panicky months just after the outbreak 
of hostilities the difference was not so great as 
might have been expected. August produced 
427 books, against 703 in August, 1913 ; Sep- 
tember 853 instead of the 1203 in the same 
month of 1913; and October rallied to the 
extent of 1244, not a serious decrease from 
the 1696 of the year before. November's 
record exactly equalled that of November, 
1913, and December exceeded by 135 the num- 
ber credited to the last month of the preceding 
year. Significant of the seriousness of men's 
minds in these trying days is the increase of 
religious books, from 889 to 969, in the British 
book-trade of 1914 as compared with 1913. 
Perhaps there is an equally obvious signifi- 
cance in the lessened production of philosophi- 
cal works 179 as compared with 280 a 
partial exclusion of German-made philosophy 
being probably responsible for some of this 
decrease. Sociological discussion seems also 
to have been somewhat restricted, the fine arts 
are not quite so flourishing, travel falls off a 
little, and even biography wanes all, pre- 
sumably, on account of the war. On the other 



hand, however, a new department of literature 
is admitted to the statistical tables, a depart- 
ment of naval and military works, which cer- 
tainly owes its present prominence to the 
existing belligerent state of Europe. Four 
hundred and two books are classed under this 
new head, and many of them have had large 
sales. It would be interesting now to learn 
what effect the war has had on the book-trade 
of Germany, hitherto the foremost of book- 
producing nations. 



A GENEROUS BENEFACTION TO ARTS AND LET- 
TERS comes to public notice in Mr. Archer M. 
Huntington 's gift of a site, in upper Manhat- 
tan, for a building to serve as a home for the 
American Academy of Arts and Letters and 
the National Institute of Arts and Letters. 
The situation is suitable though not, to an 
architect, ideal. It is at Broadway and 155th 
and 156th streets, where other learned socie- 
ties have their habitations, and where there- 
fore the openness of space requisite to give 
dignity to a fine building is lacking. The 
Hispanic Society, the Numismatic Society, 
and the Geographical Society are already here 
installed, and their presence will help to coun- 
teract the less dignified aspect of the monster 
apartment houses that hem in the proposed 
site on two sides. How to erect something 
less than a sky-scraper that shall not be 
dwarfed by these pretentious rookeries will 
be a problem for the resourceful architect to 
wrestle with. A brief backward glance shows 
interestingly at this time that the Institute 
will ere long be rounding out its second 
decade, having come into existence in 1898, 
while the Academy, its offspring, has six fewer 
years of useful activity to its credit. Of the 
original seven chosen by the Institute as a 
nucleus to the proposed Academy, Mr. How- 
ells, the Academy's President, is the only one 
now living, Clemens, Stedman, Hay, Saint- 
Gaudens, and La Farge having all paid their 
debt to nature. Our Immortals, it will be 
noted, number fifty, and not forty; but our 
Academy embraces all the arts, whereas the 
French Academy is, ostensibly at least, one of 
letters. Our Academy will, in its proposed 
home, front no River Seine, have as an ap- 
proach no Pont des Arts, but it is always pos- 
sible that it will build more stately mansions 
as the swift seasons roll. 



A BROAD-GAUGE PERIODICAL, representing 
what at first might be regarded as a rather 
narrow range of interests, but which is easily 
demonstrated to be the very reverse of narrow, 
is "The Newarker," now widely and favor- 
ably known as ' ' the house organ of the Newark

Free Public Library." A recent issue, con- 
taining articles on civic beauty, clay and its 
uses, old New Jersey pottery, and other sub- 
jects less distantly related to library work, has 
also an editorial utterance in able and ener- 
getic defence of the periodical's liberal policy 
in relation to printable matter. So admirable 
in its make-up (its typography, paper, illus- 
trations, and general attractiveness) is "The 
Newarker," that one is glad to aid in giving 
further currency to its editor's enlightened 
views in respect to library publications. Of 
his own monthly periodical he truly says that 
it "does not to most libraries look like the 
publication of a library, its organ and pro- 
moter. This is because most libraries do not 
realize that a new day of print is upon us; 
that their books and journals may continue to 
be used to ' broaden, ' to ' uplift, ' to ' spiritual- 
ize,' to entertain, to refresh and to wait upon 
scholarship, and yet may at the same time be 
useful to the tinker, the tailor, the candle- 
stick-maker, the brick-layer, the salesman and 
the farmer, in their homely tasks of earning a 
living, finding a market and cheapening their 
products. . . . THE NEWARKER goes against 
library traditions in the things which it 
prints," as the briefest glance at its varied 
pages will show ; and this is well, for perhaps 
there is no set of traditions that can so well 
endure a little courageous smashing as the 
traditions of the public library. 


AIDS TO CULTURE, of a less doubtful efficacy 
than modern warfare, received timely con- 
sideration the other day from Professor Henri 
Liehtenberger, Harvard exchange professor, 
at the third meeting of the Alliance Franchise 
in Boston. European culture was his theme, 
which he admitted might be thought a rather 
inopportune subject to discuss at this time 
when national sentiment and national ideals 
are so predominant over any larger and more 
inclusive conceptions. But even now the 
European nations are betraying their uneasy 
consciousness of not being, any one of them, 
wholly sufficient unto itself. The belligerent 
states thirst for the approval of their neutral 
neighbors. Among the factors contributing 
to a more enlightened European culture the 
speaker named the development of rational 
science, whether historical or natural, to which 
all large universities lend a helping hand, and 
the promotion of a higher civilization through 
commerce. Stress was laid upon the need of 
developing a European spirit, as distinct from 
a national spirit. Why not aim rather at a 
cosmopolitan spirit and a world culture? 
Asiatic and European ideals are sure to clash 
if each continent remains content to develop a 



culture exclusively adapted to its own tastes 
and needs. In violent contrast with the 
French savant's liberal programme for all 
Europe stands the recent utterance of a Prus- 
sian publicist, Herr Maximilian Harden, who 
makes bold to declare: "We do not stand 
before the judgment seat of Europe. We 
acknowledge no such jurisdiction. Our might 
shall create a new law in Europe. It is Ger- 
many that strikes. When she has conquered 
new domains for her genius, then the priest- 
hoods of all the gods will praise the god of 
war." What a departure, in this representa- 
tive of modern Germany, or of a certain part 
of it, from the aims and ideals of Goethe and 
Schiller and Lessing ! 

* 

LITERARY LIKINGS OF THE SERIOUS VERMONT- 
ERS come interestingly to view in the "Tenth 
Biennial Report of the Free Public Library 
Commission of the State of Vermont. ' ' With 
only two decades of organized library effort 
to look back upon, the Green Mountain people 
already have 198 free libraries, twenty-seven 
not free, and 267 stations to which travelling 
libraries are sent, so that only twenty-nine 
towns remain unprovided with library facili- 
ties of some sort, and only fifty have no per- 
manent libraries. In the record of travelling 
collections of books it is noteworthy that 
thirty-six per cent of the adult reading is of 
the class known as non-fiction, while the 
juvenile reading of a similar serious character 
attains the handsome total of fifty-six per cent. 
The average of non-fiction circulation in pub- 
lie libraries is supposed to be about twenty- 
five per cent. Thus the Vermonters show 
themselves to be considerably less frivolous 
than the majority of their fellow-countrymen, 
and the Vermont children far less light- 
minded than their elders. But the tremen- 
dous seriousness of childhood is proverbial 
everywhere. In fact, the theory was long ago 
advanced by certain wise men of the East that, 
whereas the body is born young and grows 
every year older, the soul is born old and gains 
in youthfulness with the passage of time. 
Hence, doubtless, our devotion to ephemeral 
fiction in our toothless and tottering old age. 



HUMORS OF THE ADVERTISING PAGE come 
nowhere more frequently or more amusingly 
to notice than in the columns of the sober and 
sedate London "Times." Some weeks ago 
that journal published an advertisement in- 
serted by a gentleman who signified his will- 
ingness to accept the free use of a touring car 
and accompanying chauffeur for week-end 
excursions as a restorative from exhausting 
labors in connection with the present interna-

tional conflict. And now a more recent issue 
contains this specimen of advertising humor: 
"Gentleman, 30, perfect health, magnificent 
physique, absolutely fit, offers himself for 
vivisection experiments to any one who would 
care to infect him with complaint known as 
the embarrassment of riches. ' ' One is tempted 
to search for the motive that prompts these 
anonymous and obviously futile exhibitions of 
facetiousness at a considerable cost to the 
humorist himself. It must be a purely artis- 
tic impulse, a love of art for art's sake, an irre- 
sistible desire to cut an intellectual caper, just 
as the armadillo and the wombat are known to 
execute in the night solitudes certain ridicu- 
lous gambols that serve no purpose whatever 
except to give a moment's free play to the 
animal's creative instincts as an artist in 
antics. It is the innate necessity of self- 
expression in each case. 



AN EDITORIAL RETROSPECT of a not ungrati- 
fying character is indulged in by "Public 
Libraries" on the occasion of its entrance 
upon its twentieth year of increasing use- 
fulness. When that excellent monthly was 
started there was, says its editor, "but one 
other periodical devoted exclusively to library 
matters," and the new venture was regarded 
as extremely hazardous. But the magazine 
has handsomely vindicated its right to exist- 
ence, and has doubtless served to encourage 
the founding of the now sufficiently numerous 
kindred publications that were not dreamt of 
twenty years ago. In library development it 
has witnessed the increase of states giving aid 
to library extension from a meagre two or 
three to a widely beneficent thirty-seven. Not 
more than half a dozen library associations 
had struggled into being when ' ' Public Libra- 
ries" drew its first breath; now there are 
seventy such local organizations with an esti- 
mated membership of more than six thousand. 
In fact, the great things and the new things 
that have come to pass in the library world 
within the lifetime of this monthly survey of 
that world are far too numerous to mention 
' ' all of which, ' ' it might, in classic phrase, not 
immodestly add, "I saw, and a part of which 

I was." 



LUMBER-CAMP LIBRARIES FOR WISCONSIN fol- 
low quite promptly the establishment of such 
antidotes to ennui in the forests of Minnesota. 
Of course these libraries have no costly and 
permanent Carnegie buildings; indeed they 
have no buildings at all, but are housed in 
boxes that travel thither and yon as need re- 
quires. It is said by those who have had expe- 
rience in supplying literature to the "lumber 



jacks" that many of these artisans in timber 
are men of education, and they all prefer good 
books to trash. There is a tradition of a cer- 
tain lumber camp where the hunger for read- 
ing-matter was so gnawing that a stray copy 
of "The Atlantic Monthly" was thumbed un- 
til its contents were committed to memory. 
On the other hand, the cheap illustrated 
magazines are commonly rejected with dis- 
gust by the sturdy axemen. The "Wisconsin 
Library Bulletin" invites the assistance of 
public libraries in that State in supplying 
books and periodicals for the lumber camp 
travelling libraries. Communications should 
be sent to the Library Commission at Madi- 
son, and it is safe to infer that even assistance 
from beyond the borders of Wisconsin would 
not be unwelcome. 



THE INCREASING COST OF CULTURE, or at least 
of the culture bearing the college or university 
label, is unmistakably indicated by the an- 
nouncement, in President Lowell's latest 
annual report, of a considerable deficit in the 
year's finances at Harvard, and in his recom- 
mendation of an increase in the rate of tuition. 
Several professors have generously returned 
their year's salaries to the treasurer, while 
others have relinquished a part of their pay. 
The president is said to have handed back his 
salary in full. Significant at this time is the 
report of the Massachusetts Board of Educa- 
tion, just sent in, advising against the found- 
ing of a State university a project for some 
time under consideration but suggesting as 
a less expensive partial substitute for such 
action the annual appropriation of a certain 
sum for scholarships for deserving pupils in 
the existing colleges and universities and tech- 
nical schools of the commonwealth. The cost 
of higher education throughout the country 
has greatly increased since many, not yet old, 
received their college diplomas; but this is 
only another phase of the increased cost of 
living. 

COMMUNICATIONS. 



" GEEMAN " AND "AMERICAN." 

(To the- Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Mr. 0. E. Leasing asks a series of questions in 
your issue of February 1, to which I beg to be 
allowed a partial response. In his introduction to 
these questions, Mr. Lessing announces himself to 
be " a plain American citizen of German descent " ; 
I, using the words in precisely the sense in which 
Mr. Lessing uses them, am a still plainer American 
citizen of American descent, as are rather more 
than fifty millions of my countrymen. By that I 
mean to say that, just as Mr. Lessing points with 
pride to a father or grandfather born in Germany, 
so do I and the fifty million others like me point

THE DIAL 



with pride to a grandfather's grandfather who 
fought for American independence against a Ger- 
man king who was endeavoring to foist ideas upon 
England, and so upon America, which bear a 
marked family resemblance in method and content 
to the ideas which Germany is seeking to intrude 
at this moment upon Belgium. 

The difference in point of view between us is a 
remarkable one, and one which most Americans of 
ancestry and habits of thought similar to mine 
could not have been convinced existed eight months 
ago. The chief difference, it seems to me, lies in 
the fact that there is no phase of the present war 
which we Americans are viewing with a European 
squint; there are few phases of it which the Ger- 
mans in America are viewing with an American 
squint. Note that I do not say " German- 
Americans." William the Greatest settled that bit 
of bastardy once and for all. " Germans I know," 
he said, "and Americans I know; but I do not 
know German-Americans." I see no use in pre- 
tending to be more German than William the 
Greatest; I merely assert that I and those like me 
are Americans. 

This brings me to the first question : " What 
does the ' Declaration of Independence ' mean ? 
Independence of English rule or German rule ? " 
The answer is rather pitifully obvious: Indepen- 
dence of both English and German rule, even 
though an English king was attempting to enforce 
upon the freeborn Englishmen of the old colonies 
ideas which were no more characteristically Ger- 
man then than they are at this moment. Read the 
Declaration. It is directed against whom? Until 
the next paragraph before the last it speaks of one 
individual only, " the present King of Great Brit- 
ain." And who was he? George III., of German 
descent so pure that one has to go back seven 
generations to find a suspicion of contaminating 
''Anglo-Saxon" blood. His government of the 
colonies was typically German, as exemplified in 
the government of Alsace-Lorraine to-day gov- 
ernment without representation. The friends of 
the rebelling Americans were, quite characteris- 
tically, the English Whigs, political ancestors of 
the Liberal party which found itself compelled to 
declare war against Germany last August. The 
friends of George III., quite characteristically, 
were those obliging fellow German sovereigns who 
lent him their soldiers to put down the American 
rebellion, when free Englishmen refused to recruit 
his armies for service against us. Read from as 
obvious a source as the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 
a paragraph about George III. : 

" He would have given England that dangerous 
position of supremacy which was gained for France 
by Lewis XIV. in the seventeenth century, and by 
Napoleon in the nineteenth century. He would 
have made his country still more haughty and 
arrogant than it was, till other nations rose against 
it, fis they have three times risen against France, 
rather than submit to the intolerable yoke." 

Has not this a certain familiar sound? What 
Americans fought for and what the Declaration of 
Independence sets forth is the ideal of the English- 
speaking peoples, and not the ideals of any of the 
German-speaking peoples made effective in history. 



It is the world-old conflict between that fine old 
Bourbon maxim, even more effective in Germany 
in the twentieth century than it was in the 
eighteenth, " Everything for the people, nothing 
by the people"; and the English maxim finally 
crystallized in Lincoln's "A government of the 
people, for the people, by the people." It is the 
difference exemplified between the governments of 
the English-speaking peoples and of the German- 
speaking people to-day, whether, as Jefferson, 
author of the Declaration, said, governors are to 
be in moral fear of the governed, or the governed 
in physical fear of their governors. We Amer- 
icans owe much to England and English laws and 
ideals. We owe much to Americans like Francis 
Lieber and Carl Schurz, who chanced to be of 
German birth, and to the immigrants of '48 and 
'49, who rebelled against the Prussian and other 
German constitutions of that day, which stand 
practically unchanged at the present moment. But 
we have no criticism quite as effective as the pres- 
ence in this free country of what we are told are 
twenty-five millions of Germans the greater the 
number the more effective the criticism who are 
here because life was unendurable to them in the 
Fatherland. Moreover, we expect many more mil- 
lions to add to the weight of this criticism and 
bring it down to date when this frantic war is over. 

We Americans find ourselves criticized for our 
Americanism by certain of these transplanted but 
unrooted Germans, chiefly in periodicals mori- 
bund or non-existent at the opening of the war. 
These find it logical to offset their devotion to 
German governmental ideals as exemplified by 
William the Greatest by savage criticism of Amer- 
ican government as exemplified by the President 
of the United States, a Jefferson-minded man; 
apparently unaware that the very freedom of the 
press they are exercising makes possible their live- 
lihood here as against life in jail and suppression 
of their organs in Germany. We can at least wel- 
come their appreciation of their new opportuni- 
ties and their quickness in taking advantage of it. 
But we are inclined to resent any implication that 
we as Americans would leap to the command of a 
British official, as so many Germans in this coun- 
try have come to heel at hearing their master's 
voice echo through Dr. Richard Dernburg; and 
many of us have read Dr. Dernburg's arguments 
in favor of mental reservations in oaths, or of ends 
justifying means, with a curiously baffled sense 
that those questions were disposed of in the 
English-speaking world during the reigns of the 
Stuarts. 

Coming to Mr. Lessing's second question, it 
seems easy enough to admit that England, rather 
than Germany, has wronged Ireland in the past, 
but it still appears to us that this is largely due 
to the fact that Germany had no chance; surely 
England may plead Home Rule in extenuation. 
But what can Germany and Austria plead in 
extenuation of their treatment of the Poles; and 
what has Germany to say for Alsace-Lorraine, 
whose representatives in the Reichstag are not 
even elected by its people? 

Certainly, too, answering the third question, 
England and not Germany conquered India, 



108

Egypt, and the Boer Republics. But again En- 
gland can plead the results to-day in justification 
more or less complete. She has no frightful 
slaughters on her mind like that of the Hereros in 
German Southwest Africa, nor exhibitions of 
Scbrecklichkeit such as were given by the German 
expeditionary force in China. Parenthetically it 
may be observed that Americans, fighting Indian 
savages across a continent, have been familiar with 
this particular quality in warfare since the first 
settlements, just as Ross's destruction of the Con- 
gressional Library in Washington in the reign of 
George III. lent us comprehension of Belgian feel- 
ing, when the Louvain library was fed to the flames. 

American's are able to see a vital difference 
between British " navalism " and German mili- 
tarism, responding to the fourth question, " Who 
controls the sea ? " We see Germany, for exam- 
ple, quite as infected with " navalism " as Great 
Britain, while Great Britain was hardly touched 
by militarism at all before the outbreak of the 
war, as unexpected by Britons as almost complete 
unpreparedness proves it to have been. We see, 
too, that the navy of England performs its func- 
tions on the seas, and that its officers in no pos- 
sible sense dominate the daily thought of the 
British people. If it is an evil, it is at worst a 
cutaneous one, not a cancer eating out the nation's 
vitals. Furthermore, the position of the British 
;Isles makes starvation only too easy without con- 
trol of the seas, while Germany has never had that 
excuse to pleacL Even now, had it not been for 
that almost inevitable blundering that seems to 
go .with, arrant militarism, whether under George 
III. or William the Greatest, America would be 
supplying Germany with food for her civilian 
population. But, just as the question was about 
to be settled to that effect, the German govern- 
ment/proclaimed all food supplies as the property 
, of the .State, leaving discrimination between food 
, for civilians and food for the military impossible. 
Finally, it may be urged that Great Britain's con- 
trol of the sea has been beneficent, with that per- 
fect restraint which comes with accustomed power, 
ever since America gaye up its control of the seas 
after, the Civil War; while there is nothing in 
German history ; since 1870 to lead us to believe 
that the same control could pass to other hands 
with equal security tp civilization. 
. I have no doubt that Mr. Lessing is right about 
Treitschke's being older than Nietzsche. When 
German scholarship is not speaking about mili- 
tarism and its consequences, it is generally right. 

Every American must regret that any German 
can, sneer at Anglo-Saxonry with a good con- 
science. We find it occasion for pride that we 
belong to a great family of self-governing nations 
framed upon Anglo-Saxon ideas of individual 
rights and constitutional liberty, hardly touched at 
all until this war began with militarism and lax 
conceptions of treaty obligations. We take no less 
pride in a mighty literature which embodies these 
ideas and ideals, and has seldom been false to them 
at any point; and we should like to have the Ger- 
mans proud of them, too, as we are proud of 
Goethe. WALLACE RICE.

"LITERARY" VERSUS "COMMERCIAL" 
DRAMA. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
. Your recent criticism of an article by Mr. W. C. 
de Mille in the January " Yale Review " puts sev- 
eral questions to Mr. de Mille as to his conclusions 
about our " commercial " drama. I should like to 
go a step farther and ask a question about his 
premises. What does he mean by " commercial " 
drama anyway; and how, according to his defini- 
tion, does it differ from that which he patroniz- 
ingly refers to as " literary " ? All through his 
article, we find assumed, a distinction between the 
two forms, and always to the discredit of the lat- 
ter. What, then, are the requirements that Mr, de 
Mille makes for the " commercial " play ? On 
looking through the article, we find that the " com- 
mercial " play must provide " entertainment," 
must " tell a story which finds its best expression 
through acting ' ; ; it must be " a splendid piece of 
craftsmanship " ; it must " reflect to a large degree 
the point of view of its audience " and " get its 
hands on their hearts." Now by a strange coinci- 
dence, these and no others have always been 
considered the requirements of the " literary " 
play, which Mr. de Mille nowhere clearly defines. 

Thus we may conclude that, under favorable cir- 
cumstances, " commercial " drama and " literary " 
drama are one, or rather become one through the 
simple medium of the box-office. That these 
favorable circumstances once existed as they do 
not exist to-day, no student of stage history would 
deny. In Elizabethan London, prices of theatre 
seats were such that the drama was indeed a 
"democratic" art; and, further, no despotic cen- 
sor or trust magnate intervened between public and 
playwright. This was the great period of the ; lit- 
erary play, which, because it met the requirements 
of " commercial " drama, drew crowded houses. 

On the other hand, when we get down to the 
early part of the nineteenth century in England, we 
find that the " literary " play and the " commer- 
cial " play have become two different things, not 
necessarily through any fault of either public or 
dramatist, but through the outside interference of 
official censor and theatrical manager. On the 
commercial side, we have tawdry stage successes 
which would not at all answer Mr. de Mille's re- 
quirements for " commercial " drama, in that, for 
one thing, they fail signally to reflect the viewpoint 
of the great era succeeding the French Revolution. 
On the literary side, we have the closet-dramas of 
Byron and Shelley, which, although they breathe 
the fiery spirit of the social awakening, do not 
wholly obey generally accepted laws of technique. 

Let us hope that the time is approaching when 
" literary " drama and " commercial " drama will 
again be one. Perhaps Mr. de Mille means to 
prophesy this when in the cause of the " commer- 
cial " play, he appropriates all the " literary " 
play's qualities. If this is so, one can only say 
that he appears to be confusing the issue when he 
exalts " commercial " drama thus endowed to so 
high a seat and leaves " literary " drama, thus 
robbed and stripped, to lie by the roadside.

A SOLDIER-SURGEON'S IlEMIXISCENCES.* 

An autobiography richer in varied interest, 
more diversified with pictures of life amid all 
sorts of surroundings and in many dissimilar 
fields of activity, and in the rehearsing of it 
re-lived with keener zest and, if one may add 
it without offence, greater complacency, of a 
justifiable sort, than the life-story of Dr. John 
Allan Wyeth, is. not offered to the reader 
every month in the year or every year in the 
century. "With Sabre and Scalpel" he calls 
this "autobiography of a soldier and sur- 
geon, ' ' but in addition to his dashing exploits 
as a Confederate trooper in the Fourth Ala- 
bama Cavalry, and his subsequent notable 
achievements in medicine and surgery, he has 
been a farmer, woodsman, cotton-planter, 
cattle-buyer, river-pilot, telegraph-operator, 
land-speculator, building contractor, lecturer 
in his profession, twice president of the New 
York Academy of Medicine, founder of the 
New York Polyclinic School and Hospital, 
which is the first institution of its kind in 
this country to offer post-graduate courses, 
and author of numerous works both of tech- 
nical and more general interest, including a 
life of General Nathan B. Forrest and an his- 
torical sketch of the settlement of Oregon. 
No mean talent is his also for the turning of 
graceful verse, as he is pleased to remind the 
reader by appending to his latest book a half- 
score of what may be styled occasional pieces, 
some if not all of which have already seen the 
light in magazines or elsewhere. If it be per- 
missible, for variety 's sake, to give the present 
review a certain topsy-turviness, let us begin 
by bespeaking the reader's favorable opinion 
of Dr. Wyeth the poet, and to this end quoting 
from his appendix the first stanza of some 
animated and pleasing verses that may be 
read in full in Bryant's "New Library of 
Poetry and Song." They are entitled "My 
Sweetheart's Face," and begin, with rather 
original as well as felicitous imagery, as 
follows : 

" My kingdom is my sweetheart's face. 

And these the boundaries I trace: 

Northward her forehead fair; 

Beyond a wilderness of auburn hair; 

A rosy cheek to east and west; 
Her little mouth 
The sunny south, 

It is the south that I love best." 
That a man capable of such flights of song 
is, other things being equal, a man likely to

dier and Surgeon. By John Allan Wyeth, M.D., LL.D. Illus- 
trated. New York : Harper & Brothers. 



interest one in his other than poetic capaci- 
ties, may not unreasonably be assumed. And 
other things are not unequal, for the same 
impress of a distinctive personality stamps 
itself on all his heterogeneous activities and 
saves his recital from any touch of triteness 
or monotony. A rather sure index to a man's 
character is commonly thought to be found by 
a study of the mother's mental and moral 
endowment. Therefore it may be possible to 
throw a sidelight if not a full-face flash of 
illumination on the subject of our inquiry by 
relating in the author's own words the story 
of how he "discovered" his maternal parent 
when he was well advanced in his seventh 
year. 

"The discovery came about in- this fashion: 
a boy playmate lost his temper at something that 
happened between us, and in anger gave me a slap 
which I did not resent. At this juncture I heard 
a voice from a near-by window, and, turning, I 
saw my mother leaning out, her eyes flashing s6 
that I could almost see the sparks flying and her 
cheeks as red as fire. . In a tone about which there 
could be no misinterpretation, even by one who 
instinctively preferred peace to war, she asked me 
if the boy struck me in anger; and when I told 
her he had, she blazed up and said, 'And you 
didn't hit him back ? ' My response was that 
father had told me it was wrong to fight, and that 
when another boy gave way to anger just to tell 
him it was wrong and not fight back. At this the 
blue bonnet of Clan- Allan [the mother's maiden 
name] went ' over the border,' and she fairly 
screamed : ' I don't care what your father told 
you; if you don't whip that boy this minute I'll 
whip you ! ' And she looked on, and was satisfied 
when it was over. I date my career from that 
eventful day; for I had come to the parting of 
the ways." 

Thus sprung of Old Testament and New 
Testament parentage, so to speak, the Ala- 
bama boy, who was sixteen years old when the 
Civil War broke out, yielded to the prompt- 
ings of the less pacific strain in his blood and 
soon, with his noble mare, Fanny^ whose sad 
end forms a touching episode in the narrative, 
joined a troop of cavalry and played a spir- 
ited if inconspicuous part in the national 
drama before he was taken prisoner in the 
autumn of 1863 and confined for a year and 
a half at Camp Morton, Indiana, after which 
there was no more fighting for him to do. 
Not to convey a false impression of the pacific 
father, it should be added that even his dis- 
inclination to violence did not keep him at 
home when the call to arms reached him. As 
a matter of fact, he was earlier in the field 
than his son. 

Interesting and enlightening are the views 
which this loyal Southerner takes of sundry 
questions that once were burning issues be-

tween the North and the South. His pictures 
of the negro slave's not unhappy lot, of the 
evils of abolitionism, of the splendid patriot- 
ism of those to whom state rights meant more 
than national unity, and of southern condi- 
tions in general as he intimately knew them, 
are not to be passed over with cursory and 
unsympathetic glance, whatever the reader's 
preconceptions and predilections. From the 
opening pages of the book the following 
vehement utterance may be taken as char- 
acteristic and significant: 

" I am firmly convinced that if instead of the 
nagging, irritating, insulting, and finally insurrec- 
tionary and murderous meddlesomeness of the 
Northern abolitionists, the conservative and better 
portion had united in earnest and friendly co- 
operation with their brothers of the South, who 
proved their zeal and devotion to principle by the 
wholesale sacrifice of wealth and ease, the humane 
scheme of emancipation and colonization as set 
forth in the ' Virginia Resolutions ' would have 
been carried out and chattel slavery would have 
disappeared by peaceful means." 

In a subsequent chapter we find the portrait 
of that hero of anti-slavery days, John Brown, 
drawn with no flattering touches. The fea- 
tures are delineated with strokes like this : 

" Out of this turmoil emerged a weird, red- 
handed specter in human form whose name but for 
his lawless deeds in Kansas would never have 
crossed the boundaries of that fair State had he 
not become the agent in one of the most nefarious 
plots recorded in history. A group of men of 
intelligence, position, and wealth aided him in the 
armed invasion of a peaceful and law-abiding com- 
munity. Brown's purpose was the treasonable 
capture of the United States arsenal and the 
appropriation of government property to an un- 
lawful purpose, the robbery of the houses of law- 
abiding citizens, and murder. He sought to incite a 
wide-spread slave insurrection and the consequent 
massacre of thousands of helpless women and chil- 
dren. This wicked deed, known as the ' Harper's 
Ferry Raid,' made secession possible and brought 
on tbe Civil War." 

No gleam of admiration for a martyr's hero- 
ism is to be discerned in the glowing terms 
with which the author paints the deeds of 
this remarkable man. On another page he 
further writes in his dispraise that "having 
failed at every one of a half-dozen different 
vocations to make a living for his family and 
himself, a rolling stone so mossless that at the 
age of fifty-five he was absolutely bankrupt 
in fortune, and no less so in honorable reputa- 
tion, John Brown turned up in Kansas in 
October, 1855, in the role of a professional 
Free-soil agitator." If one wishes a view of 
the Kansas occurrences of that day quite dif- 
ferent from the accepted northern presenta- 
tion of those historic events, let one read 
Dr. Wyeth. 



The chapters devoted to memories of the 
war have the lively interest belonging to all 
well-written accounts of personal experience 
in battle and in camp and on the march. The 
narrative of prison life at Camp Morton has 
the one fault of brevity, which cannot be 
said of the author's term of imprisonment 
itself. A larger view of things military is 
found in the portion of the book devoted to 
the battle of Chickamauga, where the author 
indulges in speculation as to what might have 
been. ' ' In my opinion, ' ' he says, ' ' the South- 
ern Confederacy was won here by desperate 
valor and lost by the failure of the command- 
ing general to appreciate the magnitude of 
his victory and to take advantage of the great 
opportunity which was his for the capture or 
destruction of the entire Union army in 
Georgia and Tennessee. Chickamauga, as I 
interpret it from personal observation and 
from careful study, marked the high tide of 
the Confederacy." 

Making an abrupt transition now, let us get 
a glimpse of Dr. Wyeth in one of his many 
non-military aspects. Toward the end of his 
book, where the practice of medicine supplants 
the sterner occupations of war, he shows him- 
self interestingly in a character not unlike 
that of Sherlock Holmes. After relating a 
Holmes-like incident in Dr. Weir Mitchell's 
professional experience, he details a similar 
occurrence in his own. 

" Spending the summer near New York, I made 
it the rule to be in my office in the city at a certain 
hour on two days of each week. As I was nearing 
my door I noticed a man a few feet ahead of me 
who turned to ring my bell. He had on a long 
frock-coat which fitted well and wore a soft felt 
hat. At first glance I took him to be from the 
South; but as he was pulling at the bell-knob, he 
having not yet seen me, I noticed on the rim of one 
ear a well-marked epithelioma, a form of cancer 
which occurs only after frost-bite. I then placed 
him from the Northwest, for his coat and hat were 
not of the East. As I came up the stoop just 
behind him I said, ' You want to see Dr. Wyeth? ' 
He turned quickly and said, ' Yes.' I continued in 
an off-hand manner as I was getting my key into 
the lock and not looking toward him, 'About that 
cancer? ' He said, ' Yes.' ' From the Northwest? ' 
'Yes.' 'Nebraska or Iowa?' 'Why? Iowa!' 
' What regiment did you serve in during the war? ' 
(He had a small Grand Army button on the lapel 
of his coat collar.) ' I was major of the Thir- 
teenth Iowa.' . . . By this time we were standing 
within the hallway, and he said: 'All right; but 
before we go any further I'd like to know how 
much you will charge me for the operation.' I 
told him ; and then he exclaimed : ' Well, my

ART 



HISTORY.* 



"My desire," writes Mr. Lisle March Phil- 
lipps, in his book on "Art and Environment," 
"has been to confine myself to the considera- 
tion of art as an expression of human life and 
character. Selecting some of the great periods, 
or creative epochs, in the art of the world, I 
have endeavoured to deduce from them the dis- 
tinguishing qualities, limitations, and points 
of view of the races which produced them." 
These, Mr. Phillipps thinks, are revealed 
chiefly by architecture, and only secondarily 
by sculpture and painting and such minor arts 
as furniture-making; consequently he devotes 
the bulk of his book to an interpretation of 
various architectures. 

Mr. Phillipps 's treatment is both lively and 
persuasive. Like all intelligent persons, he 
has strong preferences and reasons for them 
that he believes in, so that his epithets for what 
he dislikes are striking, even though his com- 
mendations of what he prefers do not appear 
excessive. So far as we are aware, no one 
since Taine has expounded with so much vigor 
and good sense any phase of the principle that 
works of art are to be understood in terms of 
race, time, and place. On the whole, Mr. Phil- 
lipps succeeds in ignoring time and place, par- 
ticularly when considering those types of art 
that have his approval ; environment seems to 
matter chiefly in determining the works of the 
Egyptians, the Arabs, and the eighteenth cen- 
tury aristocratic French, which he dislikes. 
An innocent reader is led to wonder why the 
word "environment" and not "race," ap- 
pears in the title ; all the more, in view of the 
author's avowed intention to deduce the quali- 
ties of races from their gesthetic creations.

Re- 



Soon, however, the reader begins to wonder 
whether "race" would have been the better 
term. He observes the whole book permeated 
by another and more general distinction, a 
distinction based on the presence of certain 
qualities of the human spirit, and transverse 
to the distinctions of race. The qualities are 
notably intellectuality and passionate energy. 
With them, he finds, Mr. Phillipps coordinates 
aesthetic traits. Thus, predominant horizon- 
tality in architectural line is said to reveal 
intellectuality in the people that use it, while 
predominant verticality or obliquity is said to 
reveal energy. The one is the expression or 
effect of the other, so that Greek and Renais- 
sance builders built as they did because they 
were intellectual; and they were intellectual 
because they built as they did. And Arabs 
and Goths built as they did because they were 
energetic; and they were energetic because 
they built as they did. This is the skeleton of 
Mr. Phillipps 's "deduction"! With it the 
division of mankind into races is superseded 
by the division of mankind into psychological 
groups, sub-intellectual, intellectual, and 
post-intellectual: the qualities of the arts be- 
come coordinated with these qualities of mind ; 
the monotony of the Egyptian, the energy and 
elan of Arabian, the activity of the Gothic with 
the sub- or un-intellectual ; the unity and 
definiteness of the Greek and the Renaissance 
with the intellectual ; the realism and expres- 
siveness of Hellenistic sculpture and Renais- 
sance sculpture and painting, intent on 
catching the fleeting details of expression with 
"spiritual emotion" which is post-intellectual. 
And there you are ! 

As a "deduction," Mr. Phillipps 's argu- 
ment begs the question. But whatever may be 
said of his argument as a deduction, nothing 
but good can be said of it as an interpretative 
vision of life and art. Indeed, he might retort 
that in this field all arguments beg the ques- 
tion, since they are really nothing more than 
an exhibition of analogies and similarities 
which are identical only to belief, and depend 
for their force on persuasiveness rather than 
on logical cogency. And we must grant that 
we have read nothing in recent years that ex- 
hibits so persuasively the opinion that race, 
human quality, rather than time and place is, 
in art, the dominant agency of control and 
creation. If, very frequently, other factors, 
particularly environment, seem to displace 
race in his account, the displacement should 
be credited, not to Mr. Phillipps 's inadvertence 
or fallibility, but to his unusual intellectual 
honesty, the rarest thing in "art-criticism," 
and his eagerness to tell the truth as he 
sees it.

THE DIAL 



[Feb. 16 



What is the truth which he sees? The 
great tradition of the Occident has its historic 
roots in Egypt. Mr. Phillipps begins, therefore, 
with the analysis of Egyptian art. The Egyp- 
tians, in his opinion, were sub-intellectual. 
Theirs was a case of arrested development, 
arrested by the Nile. The river's monotonous 
routine held them until their life and its 
changes flowed as one; it fixed their habits, 
dominated their thoughts, and ordained their 
behavior. Victims no less than beneficiaries 
of their environment, they manifested its 
overwhelming influence on them nowhere so 
clearly as in their art. This is seen to be as 
unvaried as the Nilotic floods, whose vegeta- 
tion supplies them with their model for orna- 
ment and design, a perennial repetition of 
the primitive same, a childish reproduction of 
forms not seen but recollected as a child recol- 
lects, an accumulative repetition and reproduc- 
tion, technically perfected through practice, 
spiritually inane. "Perfect yet primitive, 
young yet old, its hoary infancy defies time. 
It is the image of routine, of deadly monotony 
and unthinking iteration. ' ' 

To this ' ' hoary infancy ' ' Greek art presents 
an absolute contrast. Natural, observant, 
realistic, its essence is intellectuality, and in- 
tellectuality of a unique sort. Mr. Phillipps 
describes realism as an expression of intellec- 
tuality; for intellectuality is definitive, and 
realism defines. Sculpture is, he thinks, 
uniquely the art of the Greeks because ' ' sculp- 
ture is definition. The sculptor undertakes to 
express his ideas in a hard material, in curt, 
distinct lines, in concrete and exactly articu- 
lated forms." Hence his themes are neces- 
sarily ' ' finite ' ' ; his art refuses, if he is a. Greek, 
to deal with the unknown ; it cannot express 
"spiritual emotion" (whatever that may be) ; 
it is, for example, incapable of treating death 
as the Christian treats it. It is marked by 
limitations, as is all intellectuality; and this 
mark pervades the whole spiritual content of 
Greek life, no less than its representative art. 
The limitation of Greek spirit differs from 
that of the other intellectualist races of 
Europe in a particular way, however. It is 
unique, and its uniqueness springs from the 
fact that the Greeks were an eye-minded peo- 
ple. In them the faculty and preferences of 
seeing infected and suffused the residuum of 
consciousness. Consequently, the needs of the 
eye determine for them the principles of life 
and art; nay, life is art, and the consumma- 
tion of art the inspiration of life. In the Doric 
temple the Greek genius expresses itself with 
organic completeness. The laws of vision de- 
termine the details of its construction, and the 
construction is such that it is abstract, inde- 



pendent of time and place, self-containing 
and self-contained, unvaried and unvarying 
through the ages, like a syllogism, or a god of 
the Epicureans. This self-sufficiency, this 
"unity and repose," are ordained by the eye's 
inertia and attained by the harmonious devel- 
opment of a central structural theme. It is 
most conspicuous where the theme is un- 
Hellenic; consequently, to see the essence of 
the Greek mind in architecture, see it as it 
handles the Roman arch in the church of 
S. Sophia. That is the tour de force of the 
logical Greek genius. 

This summary falls, we are afraid, far short 
of justice to Mr. Phillipps 's brilliant chapters 
on the Greeks. Perhaps this is because we 
cannot help being quite as much impressed by 
what they fail to say as by what they say. 
They make no mention of the possible influ- 
ence of an immemorial environment, of an in- 
tense and even feverish social activity during 
the most brilliant period of Greek history, of 
possible imitative response and compensatory 
reaction to nature and society. Yet can it be 
that the Greek eye learned nothing from the 
sharp, clean outlines of the low Greek hills 
against the intensely blue Greek skies, from 
the barren landscapes definite as silhouettes in 
outlining the low and almost geometric for- 
estation? Why should the Greek have been 
less susceptible to definiteness and articula- 
tion in Nature's shapes than the Egyptian to 
the rank jungles and tepid hazes of the Nilotic 
lotos-land which were Nature's face to him? 
And is it quite logical to say that the Greek 
was eye-minded because he built Doric temples 
as he built them, and then to say that he built 
Doric temples in the lovely Doric manner be- 
cause he was eye-minded? On the contrary, 
the strenuosity of Greek life, its athleticism 
and militarism, its emphasis on the impor- 
tance of music in education, in the significant 
dynamism attributed by its most representa- 
tive philosopher, Plato, to its most charac- 
teristic philosophic conception, the "Platonic 
idea" (so distinctly visual a conception to 
the layman ! ) might easily lead to the opinion 
that the Greek was motor- or muscle-minded, 
and that his works of art, far from being an 
expression of his nature, were a compensation 
for it. Just as desires unfulfilled in fact are 
satisfied in imagination and in dream, so, it 
may be, a disorganized and embattled state 
may imagine unity and repose, and a torn 
mind may dream of peace. Such dreams and 
imaginings, realized in art, are not an ex- 
pression of a people's actual character, but 
rather a compensation for it. So, the esthetic 
mood of a people may be the direct opposite 
of its natural and political mood, even as the 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



113 



vaudevillian tastes of the American man of 
affairs are the direct opposite of his puri- 
tanical acquisitiveness and devout republican- 
ism. Mr. Phillipps has not shown that this was 
not the case with Greece. 

Nor, for that matter, is it the case with any 
of the people he deals with, certainly not 
with the Arabs, with whose works he next 
invites our souls. Mr. Phillipps offers good 
reasons for not liking the Arabian creation, 
but he invokes environment, which with him 
acts like charity, to cover and explain the mul- 
titude of its sins. The Arab lives in the desert, 
and his soul reproduces the desert's traits. He 
is possessed of "the desert's fiery elan and 
restless inconstancy." His art is "a strange 
mingling of frailty, fickleness, and poetic 
energy," which throws together any kind of 
material in any way that will hold for the 
moment, which disintegrates the trabeated and 
arcuated solidities of the Greek and Roman 
buildings into unstable and fanciful forms, 
which multiply as the shifting sands of the 
desert multiply, all to no end. The whole of 
Arab life has the fancifulness and irrelevancy 
of Arab architecture, its science gets lost in 
magic, its philosophy in mysticism, its social 
order in confusion, its military prowess in 
chaos. It is without reason and without con- 
tinuity, and before these it fades away like a 
mirage. All that Mr. Phillipps says about 
the Arabs is, we think, true; but here again 
the truth is only half-truth. What would 
have been the fate of Arabian civilization if 
Christian had not conquered Moslem in Spain, 
and Ottoman barbarism had not thrown 
Arabian culture back to its own level? What 
is to be said of the persistence of the Arab 
conversion to Mohammedanism, and the sta- 
bility and articulation of the new order that 
revelation prescribed? If Arabian philosophy 
is predominantly mystical, German is so no 
less; and as for fancifulness, the German 
content may be different, but the irrelevance 
to reality is the same. Mir. Phillipps 's account- 
ing for the Arab in art is beautifully simple, 
but Arabs are human, and with respect to the 
characterization of human beings the simple 
is too near the untrue. 

It becomes dangerously near being identical 
with the untrue in the discussion of Gothic 
architecture. To explain this, Mr. Phillipps 
disposes at a swoop of the various alternative 
accounts of its origin. That the conditions 
of labor determined the material, and the 
material determined the structural form, he 
denies; as he denies its appearance as the solu- 
tion of the structural problems of Romanesque 
builders who had difficulty in roofing their 
naves and aisles. Of environment he makes 



no mention whatsoever. The origin of Gothic 
forms is to be found, he insists, in the genius 
of the Goth, at work in France and in En- 
gland. The Goths "were what they were 
making." Their unconscious ideal, when 
they entered European history, was a life of 
action. "They valued exclusively, or at least 
primarily, such qualities as took effect in 
action." When in the twelfth century they 
have become civilized enough to express them- 
selves consciously in art, the form that comes 
spontaneously to their hand is the pointed 
arch. This is because the essence of the arch 
is its energy, it "never sleeps"; the strong 
"lateral thrust" tends to disintegrate it, and 
it must be repressed by a buttressing and 
whatnot. Gothic, says Mr. Phillipps bril- 
liantly, is not a style but a fight. 

All of which may be so, and much of which 
no doubt is so. But are the factors which 
Mr. Phillipps either completely sets aside or 
ignores deprived of potency because it is so? 
Is the relation not much more likely to have 
been reciprocal? After all, Gothic is the solu- 
tion of a structural problem ; after all, Gothic 
does make use of small stones because the con- 
ditions of labor were such as to make this use 
inevitable. These conditions might, of them- 
selves, have generated the Gothic style: they 
are sufficient for its origin. If, indeed, race 
alone were potent, North European archi- 
tecture should still be Gothic. In point of 
fact, the relation is reciprocal : purpose, need, 
modifies material ; but material, and most par- 
ticularly in the art of building, limits purpose. 
It is still impossible to make a silk purse out of 
a sow's ear, while a very excellent one may be 
made in forms appropriate to pigskin. A 
thousand years hence a Mr. Phillipps of the 
thirtieth century studying our art of the twen- 
tieth may point to an exclusive causal connec- 
tion between American sky-scrapers and the 
' ' natural ' ' strenuosity of the American ' ' race. ' ' 
On the principle that verticality expresses 
energy, he might demonstrate that the United 
States of the twentieth century was franti- 
cally energetic and proportionally irrational. 
He might gather innumerable accessory data 
from our political and economic life, our re- 
ligion and our art. But he would neglect in 
all this the real causes of the development of 
the sky-scraper. These are, first of all, the 
unnaturally high rate of ground-rent in our 
American cities, and secondly the use of the 
steel-girder and concrete as the architectural 
materials. Prevented for economic reasons 
from spreading horizontally, American archi- 
tecture rises vertically. It could not have 
become vertical without the use of structural 
steel. The limitations of material are ultimate. 



THE DIAI, 



[ Feb. 16 



That Mr. Phillipps knows all this, but is 
unconscious of it, may be seen in the uncon- 
scious paradox in which his analysis of the 
Gothic style culminates. The essence of that 
style is the pointed arch. The arch alone, 
of all architectural forms, is energetic. The 
lateral thrust, pushing outward and down- 
ward, would unless checked disintegrate, by 
force of the energy it lets loose. Gothic con- 
struction consists of check and counter-check 
of this energy. Withal, "it may be we sel- 
dom enough realize how strenuous and alive 
are the forces which are here engaged." It is 
"difficult to connect the idea of activity with 
such rigid immobility." 

But the rareness of this realization, the 
difficulty of this connection, are a rareness 
and difficulty which depend on a contrast be- 
tween the structural and cesthetic tendencies 
of Gothic architecture. It is an engineer's, 
not an artist's, analysis of the Gothic arch 
Mr. Phillipps here gives us; it has reference 
to the material. An aesthetic analysis would 
have reference to the form. And here the 
paradox begins to appear. For the Gothic 
form is, as Mr. Phillipps says, an aesthetic 
expression of energy; but it is energy in the 
reverse direction from the structural energy. 
Mechanically, the energy of the arch moves 
downward and outward : it is the energy of a 
push or thrust ; festhetically the energy moves 
upward and outward : it is the energy of a 
linear pull. Mr. Phillipps 's own language 
unconsciously expresses this fact. "Gothic 
has been called the linear type of architecture. 
. . . The web of interior lines . . . seem to 
uphold the structure ... it is in these that 
the strength and vigour appear to reside. 
. . . fit] is the most recognizable and salient 
trait of the style. These light and sinewy 
lines pervade the whole structure. They dart 
in sheaves from the floor . . . diverge and 
spread fanlike over the vault-surface . . . ' 
In sum, the total effects is that of a lateral lift. 

Inside, the lines that "uphold" "dart in 
sheaves from the floor" ; outside, the shadowed 
peaks and curves of buttress against arch, and 
arch against buttress, rising in intricate linear 
tracings against the sky, what is there in 
nature for analogue, that might so impress 
the mind of a people that their own significant 
building would tend unconsciously to assume 
its forms'? What is there but the primeval 
forest of great trees, whose long, rising shafts 
are literally an upward lift against a down- 
ward pull ; literally alive with energy ; whose 
meeting branches form natural Gothic arches, 
with intricate traceries in long avenues we 
have learned from novels to know as Gothic? 
For generations the northern peoples lived 



among them and with them, seeing them daily 
and hourly, summer and winter, until their 
generic contours, their dominant shapes, must 
have become part and parcel of the uncon- 
scious funded mentality of the race. If 
Egyptian temperament and architectural 
forms are determined by the Nile, if Arabian 
temperament and architectural forms are the 
effects of the desert, why may not Gothic be 
the outcome of immemorial association with 
the primeval forest? But Mr. Phillipps does 
not even consider this possibility. Goth, like 
Greek, is represented by him as altogether 
uninfluenced by environment. 

There are many things still to say, if space 
permitted, about Mr. Phillipps 's account of 
the art of the renaissance and its relation to 
the recrudescence of intellectuality in Eu- 
rope; about the influence upon this art of 
what he calls "spiritual emotion," and its 
connection with the philosophical ideas of 
infinity. We should like even more to dis- 
cuss his brilliant and perspicacious chapter 
on the art of the French aristocracy of the 
court of Louis XV. We should like to show 
in detail how unified and articulate his view 
is, a vision, in fact, of the march of history 
in terms of art. We should like to show how, 
like all things unified, it attains its unity 
always by minimizing or ignoring factors 
which an adequate account of art must con- 
sider; and how, therefore, one always must 
agree with Mr. Phillipps, but agree with 
reservations. One thing, however, readers 
may agree in without reservation, namely, 
that in recent years there has appeared no 
general book on the arts which so well repays 
the reading. H. M. KALLEN. 



SOME AMERICAN DISSENTERS.* 

The capital fact in the political history of 
the United States in the past ten years has 
been the growth of dissent. Not, of course, 
that dissent was unknown until the fateful 
days in which we live. For there have been 
many periods in which, in this country as 
elsewhere, it has flourished. It was, indeed, 
dissent which first gave the nation being. And 
one calls instantly to mind the epoch of 
Jeffersonian criticism of Federalist adminis- 
tration, the decades of Abolitionist denuncia- 
tion of a national government palsied by the 
grip of the slaveholder, and the Mugwump- 
Granger-Populist-Socialist era of the eighties 
and early nineties.

The dissent of the most recent years, how- 
ever, has been peculiarly comprehensive in its 
scope, penetrating in its criticism, and relent- 
less in its methods. It began to gather 
strength even before the turning of the cen- 
tury. It won its earlier triumphs in the estab- 
lishment here and there of the initiative and 
the referendum, in the enfranchisement of 
women in a number of the western states, and 
in the widespread substitution of the direct 
primary for the nominating convention. It 
found expression in the rapid growth of trade 
unionism, socialism, and the demand for in- 
dustrial democratization. It obtained, in 
time, its most illustrious and influential pro- 
tagonist in Mr. Roosevelt. And, finally, it 
acquired a name to conjure with, namely, 
progressivism. 

The future historian of our period will have 
as one of his principal tasks the interpretation 
of the progressive movement. He will have 
the advantage of a perspective which is, of 
course, unattainable at the present day. In 
the meantime, we are being supplied with 
some highly ingenious and interesting, even 
though tentative and incomplete, interpreta- 
tions from a group of young and keen students 
of American society who have been themselves 
numbered among the sympathizers with, or 
the active participants in, the movement. 
Conspicuous among these men are Mr. Croly, 
Mr. Lippmann, and Mr. Walling, all of whom, 
in recent months, have published books de- 
scriptive of progressivism as they see it. Mr. 
Croly is concerned chiefly with an explanation 
of the rise and growth of progressivism, and 
with a sympathetic exposition of the multifold 
character which it bears to-day. Mr. Lipp- 
mann portrays the semi-chaotic state in which 
the break with the past has involved us, and 
considers the means by which the sure mas- 
tery of the people is to be established. Mr. 
Walling, approaching the subject as a social- 
ist, seeks to demonstrate that the progressiv- 
ism of to-day is but a step in the direction of 
the ultimate social democracy and the social- 
istic state. 

Mr. Croly 's book must be pronounced a 
work of first-rate importance. It is admirably 
written, and we are not likely soon to have a 
discussion of the subject with which it deals 
that will be better informed, of fairer spirit, 
or more deeply philosophical. It is in no sense 
a brief for the Progressive Party as such. The 
progressivism with which it deals transcends 
the bounds of party. It may be described 
more nearly as a state of mind than as a party 
programme, and its antecedents are to be 
traced to successive stages of the nation's his- 



tory from a period as early as that of the 
formation of the Constitution. 

The fundamental proposition of progressiv- 
ism, as Mr. Croly describes it, is that the 
injustice and wastage of our American indus- 
trial and social order are too deep-seated to be 
overcome by ordinary expedients of reform; 
and the process by which, as this conviction 
has grown, reform has given way to insur- 
gency and insurgency to progressivism is 
sketched with keen insight into both the 
psychology and the economic environment of 
the American people. Reforms, whether in 
the civil service, in municipal politics, or in 
other branches of public affairs, were always 
(so we are told) half-hearted and ephemeral ; 
insurgency was largely obstructionist and 
negative; only progressivism takes the long 
view and seeks to build from the foundations. 

There are, Mr. Croly admits, various brands 
of progressivism, and the comparison which is 
drawn between the progressivism of Mr. 
Roosevelt and that of President Wilson is illu- 
minating, if not at every point convincing. 
Roosevelt progressivism, it is admitted, "can 
fairly be charged with many ambiguities." 
But in one essential respect, it is contended, 
its meaning is unmistakable. "Its advocates 
are committed to a drastic reorganization of 
the American political and economic system, 
to the substitution of a frank social policy for 
the individualism of the past, and to the 
realization of this policy, if necessary, by the 
use of efficient governmental instruments." 
The progressivism of President Wilson is 
characterized as "vague in precisely this essen- 
tial respect," and its vagueness is said to be of 
a kind that is elusive and secretive rather than 
merely flexible. While Roosevelt progressiv- 
ism considers the existing order fundamen- 
tally unsound, so that no mere loppings off 
here and tonings up there will meet the social 
need, the tendency of the Wilson school is to 
emphasize those aspects of progressivism 
which "can be interpreted as the emancipa- 
tion of an essentially excellent system from 
corrupting and perverting parasites." The 
progressivism which results is scrupulously 
careful not to be too progressive, and, like the 
reform movements which have been super- 
seded, it poses as a "higher conservatism." 
In its emphasis upon the restriction of gov- 
ernmental regulation, the "new freedom" 
harks back to Jeffersonian individualism. It 
voices no desire "to substitute for an auto- 
matic competitive economic regime one in 
which a conscious social purpose, equipped 
with an adequate technical method, was to 
play a decisive part." Mr. Croly recognizes 
that Mr. Wilson's version of progressivism, 



116 



THE DIAL 



Feb. 16 



"whatever its underlying tendency and mean- 
ing, is a high and serious doctrine, which is 
the outcome of real elevation of purpose and 
feeling, and which up to date has had on the 
whole a beneficial effect on public opinion." 
He recognizes, too, that as a matter of prac- 
tical politics Mr. Wilson, in his capacity of 
party leader, has been obliged to lay emphasis 
upon any possible analogies between pro- 
gressivism and the historic tradition of his 
party. He feels, none the less, that the Presi- 
dent's progressivism has in too large a degree 
the backward look. It is not a new birth of 
public spirit; it is a rebirth. It is not an 
awakening of public opinion to something 
novel ; it is a reawakening. It is not aiming 
at an unprecedented vitalizing of democracy, 
but at its revival along traditional lines. 
Were it not for the trammels of his party and 
official connections, Mr. Croly suggests, Mr. 
Wilson would probably place the emphasis 
differently. But as it is, his progressivism 
must be adjudged partial, halting, and inade- 
quate to meet the needs of the times. 

Mr. Croly recognizes the value of the con- 
servative spirit in a society, and he freely 
admits the general sincerity of that portion of 
the American people which is, whether or not 
it calls itself such, conservative. He agrees 
that men cannot reasonably be expected to 
break with an old system until they can see 
what is to be put in its place. The providing 
of a substitute for the existing order in the 
United States is the peculiar and indispensa- 
ble task of progressivism; and not merely a 
new order, but a new faith, "upon the rock of 
which may be built a better structure of indi- 
vidual and social life." The object of the 
present volume is to consider "whether any 
substitute is needed for the traditional system, 
and whether progressivism offers any prospect 
of living up to the manifest requirements of 
the part." The answer to both questions is, 
of course, affirmative; and whatever one's 
opinion of the conclusions reached, it must be 
conceded that the spirit in which the inquiry 
is made is altogether commendable. 

The vital defect of the existing system is 
conceived to be the indirectness of popular 
control over the national government. The 
Constitution is too difficult to amend; the 
workings of the government are controlled too 
much by legalism rather than by the public 
will ; the courts have become the irresponsible 
interpreters of the Constitution, and therefore 
the irresponsible makers of law under the 
Constitution. The best, and only real, remedy 
is declared to be direct government by the 
people, "entered into with wisdom and cau- 
tion." That direct government taking ex- 



pression chiefly in the initiative, the referen- 
dum, and the recall is retrogressive, merely 
because its methods exhibit certain analogies 
to those used in city and tribal states, is 
denied; and in a chapter under the title 
"Direct versus Representative Government" 
will be found an argument as masterful as 
has been put in print in favor of the direct 
system. The nationalizing of our democracy, 
while preserving in state and city vigorous 
agencies of local self-government; the break- 
ing of the paralyzing grip of legalism, while 
preserving the respect of the people for law ; 
the extension to the body politic of unre- 
stricted and immediate control over its gov- 
ernmental institutions, while perpetuating the 
practical conveniences of the representative 
system, these are the supreme ends toward 
which, we are assured, all true progressivism 
moves. 

The cardinal proposition of Mr. Lippmann 's 
book is that in the present era of unrest there 
is too much aimless drifting, too much futile 
beating of the waves, and not enough mastery 
of the situation such as the people are capable 
of if only they be well-informed, courageous, 
and ably led. That the epoch in which we 
live is one of unrest is a condition not of our 
choosing. The case against absolutism, com- 
mercial oligarchy, and unquestioned creeds 
has been made out. "The rebel program is 
stated. Scientific invention and blind social 
currents have made the old authority impos- 
sible in fact, the artillery fire of the iconoclasts 
has shattered its prestige. We inherit a rebel 
tradition." In this situation, , the battle for 
us, we are admonished, lies not against crusted 
prejudice but against the chaos of a new free- 
dom. The danger is no longer from unreason- 
ing conservatism, but rather from the anarchy 
of untried, unorganized, combative radical- 
ism. There must somewhere be mastery, and 
under twentieth century conditions and ideas 
the only possible master is the people. This 
means democracy. But democracy must be 
conceived as something more than the absence 
of czars, more than freedom, more than equal 
opportunity. "It is a way of life, a use of 
freedom, an embrace of opportunity." It is 
positive, virile, fundamental. 

But the proper mastery of their own affairs 
by the people is conditioned upon several 
things. It involves intelligence, alertness, and 
strong civic sense. ' ' A servile community will 
have a master, if not a monarch then a land- 
lord or a boss, and no legal device will save it. 
A nation of uncritical drifters can change 
only the form of tyranny, for, like Christian's 
sword, democracy is a weapon in the hands of 
those who have the courage and the skill to 



1915] 



THE DIAL

wield it; in all others it is a rusty piece of 
junk. ' ' The mastery of the people involves 
also a new .industrial emancipation. No one 
unafflicted with invincible ignorance, we are 
told, desires to preserve our economic system 
in its existing form. The thought is that 
there can be no true political democracy unless 
there is a much closer approach than at pres- 
ent to an economic democracy. Men must be 
reasonably well-to-do and accustomed to self- 
mastery before they can achieve a stable and 
masterful social or political democracy. 

Recognizing that the day is past when any- 
body can pretend to have laid down an inclu- 
sive or final analysis of the democratic prob- 
lem, Mr. Lippmann seeks in his book to diag- 
nose the current unrest and to ' ' arrive at some 
sense of what democracy implies." As he 
frankly explains, his chapters touch upon the 
American problem at only a few significant 
points. Of special interest is his discussion of 
the problem of ' ' big business, ' ' the labor move- 
ment, the trusts, the woman's movement, and 
the contemporary processes of intellectual and 
social emancipation. But the book is notable 
for its points of view and for its penetrating, 
often caustic, observations upon the phenom- 
ena of our time, rather than for systematic 
discussion of any subject or group of subjects. 
It is not a book of information, but one of 
suggestion. If it preaches the doctrine of 
progressi vism, it does so by the general tenor 
of its philosophy, not by the grosser method 
of direct argument. It could not more deftly 
supplement Mr. Croly 's book if it had been 
written expressly for the purpose. 

In his " Progressivism and After" Mr. 
Walling has given us, from the point of view 
of a socialist, an economic interpretation of 
contemporary American politics. That poli- 
tics in our day has well-nigh become a mere 
exercise in applied economics, is a fact known 
to every competent observer. Three-fourths of 
the time Mr. Croly and Mr. Lippmann are 
writing in their books about matters which are 
distinctly economic, or which involve impor- 
tant economic relationships. Progressivism is 
itself builded upon the unrest which arises 
principally from economic conditions. It is 
not unnatural, therefore, that Mr. Walling 
seeks to follow out in his thought the prepon- 
derating economic trend and attempts to iden- 
tify certain phases of present political and 
industrial development as stages in the his- 
toric process whose ultimate product, as he 
views it, is to be the socialistic state. That a 
complete and absolute social democracy is to 
be the eventual outcome of past and present 
developments, he never for a moment doubts. 
The rule of privileged minorities is to give 



way to that of privileged majorities, and by 
assisting in the establishment of true majority 
rule, albeit at first in the domain of govern- 
ment only, progressivism is playing directly 
into the hands of socialism. Of course Mr. 
Walling does not expect the triumph of social- 
ism immediately. On the contrary that event 
is, he admits, a long way off. The capitalistic 
regime will hold out yet awhile, and it will 
even be constrained to extend to the wage- 
earning masses certain further improvements 
in conditions of life and labor, although only 
as an expedient to increase productivity and 
profits, not at all from considerations of altru- 
ism or of patriotism. Eventually, however, 
this will fail to satisfy and, the way having 
been prepared by the reforms carried through 
by progressivism, private capitalism will be 
succeeded by state capitalism; that in time 
will give way to state socialism, or laborism; 
and from this it will be but a step to the social- 
istic society in its final and idealized form.

ARCTIC LANDS FORLORN.* 



Under the happy though cheerless title of 
"Lands Forlorn," Mr. George M. Douglas 
tells the story of his expedition in 1911-12 
through a portion of the Barren Grounds of 
Northern Canada to the mouth of the Copper- 
mine River. The ostensible object of the jour- 
ney was to report on the copper-bearing rocks 
of the Coppermine; but, although scientific 
data of value were obtained, one gets the im- 
pression throughout the narrative that the 
underlying motive was exploration pure and 
simple. Mr. Douglas had been engaged for 
years as an engineer in the hot and arid re- 
gions of the Southwest; and when oppor- 
tunity came for a holiday he naturally chose, 
being of an adventurous and resourceful 
disposition, the practically unexplored wilder- 
ness of the extreme north. The journey in- 
volved a certain amount of hardship, and 
enough danger to give spice to the adventure ; 
but what one finds peculiarly refreshing is the 
entire absence of that heroic pose that marks 
so many narratives of more or less original 
exploration. Mr. Douglas makes it clear that 
a small party of white men, accustomed to 
roughing it, with a suitable equipment, and 
without the embarrassment of native guides, 
can not only travel practically anywhere in 
Northern Canada, but may winter there with 
no very serious danger or even discomfort. 

The route was by rail to Edmonton, thence

by stage to Athabaska Landing on the Atha- 
baska, thence by canoe and scow to Fort Mc- 
Murray, and by the steamers of the Hudson's 
Bay Company to Lake Athabaska and Great 
Slave Lake and down the Mackenzie to Fort 
Norman at the mouth of Bear River. Here 
the expedition really began, Mr. Douglas and 
his companions being henceforth thrown upon 
their own resources. They made their way up 
Bear River, and through Great Bear Lake, not 
without a good deal of difficulty by reason of 
the ice; and finally reached Dease River, 
where they built a comfortable log cabin to 
serve as headquarters. From this point to the 
Coppermine was no very great distance as the 
crow flies, but the intervening country pre- 
sented serious difficulties, not the least of 
which was the fact that very few white men 
had passed this way since Hearne discovered 
the Coppermine in 1771, and even these had 
left most imperfect descriptions of the route. 
Nevertheless Mr. Douglas managed before the 
close of the season of 1911 to make his way 
over the height of land and down to the Cop- 
permine. Feeling that the way was now clear 
to their more ambitious expedition planned 
for the succeeding spring, he and his compan- 
ions settled down for the long winter at Hodg- 
son 's Point, their main camp. 

The chapter devoted to this winter in the 
Arctic makes exceedingly interesting reading. 
An ample supply of the right kind of provis- 
ions had been brought up from Edmonton, 
and systematic hunting added more than suffi- 
cient caribou and ptarmigan to keep the party 
in fresh meat, and for variety big lake trout 
could be got through the ice at any time ; dead 
spruce trees kept them in firewood. The work 
was so distributed that each man had it in 
turn to hunt, cook, and collect firewood; the 
first and last gave them outdoor exercise, 
while cooking offered endless opportunities 
for culinary experiments not always favorably 
received. Bird life was remarkably abundant 
for this rigorous country; ptarmigan were 
plentiful all the time, usually in large flocks, 
ravens were occasionally seen, as well as sev- 
eral kinds of hawks, whisky-jacks, chickadees, 
and once a big snow-white owl. The only 
really serious drawback seems to have been 
the absence of a convenient circulating library. 
Their stock of literature was naturally small. 
Mr. Douglas had borrowed Michelet's ''His- 
tory of France" from the Hudson's Bay Com- 
pany's factor at Fort Simpson, and this 
proved a godsend to the party. It was read 
and re-read, though in a manner that was 
surely somewhat original. "It was in two 
volumes, ' ' says Mr. Douglas, ' ' and the Doctor 
would read one while I pored over the other; 



then we would exchange, and re-exchange 
them. Whether he knows less about the early 
history of France now than I do I. would hesi- 
tate to conjecture. I don't think Lion ever 
tackled this book; had it been in three vol- 
umes he might have done so. ' ' These winter 
quarters were some twenty-five miles within 
the Arctic Circle; the sun was seen for the 
last time on December 9, and for the first time 
on New Year 's day ; the temperature in Janu- 
ary ran down to 56, 57, and 59 below zero. 
That men inexperienced in travel in the far 
north could spend a winter on Great Bear 
Lake, not merely in comfort but with appar- 
ent enjoyment, upsets many popular impres- 
sions as to the hardships of this region. 

The spring journey was in every respect 
successful. Thanks to their careful planning, 
and the knowledge of the route acquired the 
previous autumn, the explorers reached the 
Coppermine without serious difficulty, and 
made their way down to its mouth, spending 
some time in an examination of the copper 
deposits. Whether or not profitable ore exists 
in this country cannot be determined without 
a more thorough survey. Throughout this 
part of the narrative one obtains exceedingly 
interesting glimpses of the Eskimos. 

The book is illustrated with reproductions 
of nearly two hundred photographs taken in 
the course of the journey, all interesting and 
some remarkably so. One that has rather a 
tragic interest represents Radford and Street 
of the Mounted Police in their canoe, at Fort 
Simpson, as they started out on the expedition 
from which they never returned.

RECENT FICTION.* 



The publication of an English version of 
M. Artzibashef's "Sanine" is bound to at- 
tract attention. The book has been widely 
regarded as an expression of the despair into 
which the Russian intelligentsia degenerated 
after the failure of the last attempt to obtain 
a truly constitutional government, a despair 
which substituted doubt for faith and self- 
indulgence for self-sacrifice. It created a 
furore in Europe. Saninism became a cult 
which spread rapidly through young Russia. 
The idea behind it was that the only happi- 
ness in life is to be found in the satisfaction 
of one's immediate desires an idea which 
the book upholds by precept rather than by 
example since, with the exception of the hero,

unhappiness is visited alike on those who 
yield to their instincts and those who do not. 
Until now "Sanine" has been regarded as 
unsuitable for translation into English, not 
merely because of its scenes of passion (which 
could, and to a degree have been, eliminated) 
but because of its point of view, so alien to 
the Anglo-Saxon in its acceptance of sex- 
hunger. Professor William Lyon Phelps 
takes M. Artzibashef seriously, assuring us 
that while the tendency of this novel is to be 
deplored its art proves the author a man "to 
be reckoned with." Mr. Gilbert Cannan, who 
has made out as good a case for the book as is 
possible, takes rather the opposite view. He 
remarks in his Preface to the present version : 

" It has been objected to M. Artzibashef 's work 
that it deals so little with love and so much with 
physical necessity. That arises, I fancy, because 
his journalistic intention has overridden his artis- 
tic purpose. He has been exasperated into frank- 
ness rather than moved to truth. He has desired 
to lay certain facts of modern existence before the 
world and has done so in a form which could gain 
a hearing, as a pure work of art probably could 
not. He has attempted a re-valuation where it 
was most needed, where the unhappy Weininger 
failed. Weininger demanded, insanely, that hu- 
manity should renounce sex and the brutality it 
fosters; Artzibashef suggests that the brutishness 
should be accepted frankly, cleared of confusion 
with love, and slowly mastered so that out of pas- 
sion love can grow." 

We suspect that M. Artzibashef will find some 
little difficulty in understanding what Mr. 
Cannan is talking about, if he ever reads the 
English Preface to his novel ; but no matter. 
It is hard to believe that "Sanine" would 
have gained less of a hearing if it had been 
true instead of merely frank, like one of M. 
Brieux's plays, but there is no question about 
the justice of Mr. Cannan 's adjectives. 
"Sanine" is journalistic and frank rather 
than artistic and true. M. Artzibashef is 
hardly more to be "reckoned with" than any 
one of a dozen contemporary American nov- 
elists. He has set out to smash certain roman- 
tic notions about the sex motive, but in so far 
as he is successful he has only substituted one 
sentimentality for another. His admiration 
for Sanine, the strong, healthy, natural man 
who always takes what he wants and never 
regrets, who always says exactly what he 
means and who is as free from illusions as he 
is from doubts, is almost as naive as the 
adolescent boy's admiration for Jesse James. 
Sanine is the kind of dream of strength and 
beauty one might expect a highly introspec- 
tive, unhappy, and physically weak man to 
construct for himself. Those who are much 
given to the torture of doubt, and especially 



those who, lacking vitality, exaggerate the 
satisfactions of physical strength, are as sus- 
ceptible to this sort of romanticism exactly as 
vulgar, brutish people are susceptible to a 
kind of fine sentiment that amuses or disgusts 
persons of a critical sensibility. Those who 
thunder against such a book and those who 
hail it with a glad cry are perhaps equally 
mistaken. Its capacity to do good and its 
capacity to do harm are alike limited. But 
whatever its defects it is a sincere work. 

Mr. Cannan 's "Young Earnest" is very 
much in the vein of its predecessor, "Old 
Mole." It is better organized, but there are 
not so many good bits in it. No one can possi- 
bly take exception to it on the same grounds as 
exception has been taken to M. Artzibashef 's 
book. Rene Fourmy, the "young Earnest" 
of the title, is an instructor in economics at a 
provincial university who runs away from 
his classes and his wife to adopt driving a 
taxi-cab as a profession and to take a Lon- 
don factory girl as a mistress. Mr. Cannan 
is still vigorously engaged in attacking bour- 
geois society. It is characteristic that the 
struggle in his hero 's mind, which is the strug- 
gle to "escape from sleep and death," should 
take him from a university instructorship to 
taxi-driving. It is characteristic, also, that 
Mr. Cannan should be much more convincing 
about the sleep and death than about the 
escape from it. The story of how Linda 
Brock, clever, pretty, conscienceless, set out 
to capture Rene Fourmy is well done; the 
story of Ann Puddick is well done ; and even 
the story of Catherine, whom he finally mar- 
ried, is well done. But somehow or other, 
though the women are well sketched in, the 
man, who should be something more than a 
sketch, is never put before us. The book 
remains amusing, and sometimes moving, but 
it is not very real. Mr. Cannan has so much 
to say about his people that he has to save on 
the space he uses in presenting them. In the 
endeavor to put the material of a very long 
novel into a minimum of pages he skips too 
much. There are conversations between Rene 
and his mother, Rene and his father, and 
Rene and the three women with whom he 
successively lives, of which one feels that peo- 
ple don't say such things. Mr. Cannan is 
aware of it. He has tried to give us the essen- 
tials of their talk, having lent his people his 
own expressiveness in order to save our being 
bored with their inexpressiveness, but he sac- 
rifices too much of the illusion. We feel, as 
we have felt before of Mr. Cannan 's novels, 
that this book is the artistic experiment, im- 
mensely interesting, of a talent both "young" 
and "Earnest." LUCIAN GARY.

on subliminal linck s The Unknown Guest 

(Dodd) is certainly one of the 
most readable and stimulating works which he 
has yet produced. The clearness of his style, 
even in an English translation, is nothing 
short of amazing and a revelation to English 
readers accustomed to the cumbersome and in- 
tricate subtleties of other writers in similar 
fields. William James and M. Bergson have 
brought modern philosophies out of the clos- 
ets ; but an infinitely more difficult task is his 
who brings mysticism into the light of com- 
mon day and makes of it the most triumphant 
sort of common sense. Of the five chapters in 
the present book, three have already appeared 
in as many different magazines : ' ' The Knowl- 
edge of the Future, ' ' ' ' The Elberf eld Horses, ' ' 
and "The Unknown Guest." The other two 
chapters, "Phantasms of the Living and the 
Dead ' ' and ' ' Psychometry, ' ' are new. The 
book is the second of a trilogy: the first was 
an essay on death, entitled "Our Eternity"; 
the present volume, dealing with veridical 
apparitions and hallucinations, psychometric 
manifestations, and all manner of subliminal 
phenomena, is to be followed by a third which 
will "treat of the miracles of Lourdes and 
other places, the phenomena of so-called 
materialization, of the divining-rod and of 
fluidic asepsis." In his chapter on "The 
Knowledge of the Future," M, Maeterlinck 
presents a brief but trenchant scientific 
critique of the mightiest of all mysteries, 
psychological or theological. His investiga- 
tion at Elberfeld of Herr Krall and his won- 
derful "denkende Tiere," Muhammed, Zarif, 
and the rest, leaves little to be desired from 
the standpoint of scientific criticism, and cer- 
tainly nothing at all from that of artistic 
presentation. M. Maeterlinck sees in these 
animals indubitable indications of clairvoy- 
ancy, and so thinks it proper to discuss their 
miracles of rapid calculation and spontaneous 
thought-origination along with the other mul- 
tiform and restless travailings of "the un- 
known guest. ' ' There is within us, he writes, 
"a strange, inconsistent, whimsical and dis- 
concerting" entity that "seems to live on 
nothing but nondescript fare borrowed from 
worlds to which our intelligence as yet has no 
access. It lives under our reason, in a sort of 
invisible and perhaps eternal palace, like a 
casual guest, dropped from another planet, 
whose interests, ideas, habits, passions have 
naught in common with ours ... It knows 
everything, perhaps, but is ignorant of the 
uses of its knowledge. It has its arms laden 



with treasures . . . Lastly, even at its best 
moments, it behaves as though the fate of the 
being in whose depth it dwells interested it 
hardly at all, as though it had but an insignifi- 
cant share in his misfortunes, feeling assured, 
one might almost think, of an independent and 
endless existence." This "unknown guest" 
pervades the book, and gives to its several 
chapters a gripping unity. 



If you don 't believe that agricul-

the finest of ture is a noble calling, ranking 
high among the learned profes- 
sions, read Dr. Harvey W. "Wiley's book, "The 
Lure of the Land" (Century), in which the 
former Chief Chemist of our national Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, now a scientific farmer 
in Virginia, ably and at the same time with 
much charm of manner defends the thesis that 
"farming requires the greatest industry, the 
keenest intellect, and the best training of all 
of the professions." Though waiting until 
comparatively late in life before furnishing 
the most convincing possible proof of his faith 
in farming as the worthiest of mortal pursuits, 
Dr. Wiley was born and bred on a farm and 
was from childhood familiar with the praises 
of farming life from his father's lips. A 
favorite story often told by that wise father 
was as follows: "A farmer with three sons 
was asked what he purposed to make of them. 
He replied: 'John is the brightest of my 
boys, the most industrious, anxious to work, 
and quick to learn. I am going to make a 
farmer of him. Sam would rather talk than 
work, and is fond of telling all he knows and 
much that he imagines. I am going to make a 
lawyer of him. Thomas is the laziest one of all 
my boys. In fact, he is so lazy that he never 
gets into any trouble of any kind. I am going 
to make a preacher of him.' ' One could 
hardly be better qualified than Dr. Wiley both 
to engage intelligently in scientific farming 
and to write instructively and entertainingly 
about it. Going "at a plump age," as he 
expresses it, to till the soil, he has both a stock 
of useful technical knowledge in agricultural 
chemistry and a good supply of apt idioms 
wherewith to communicate his knowledge and 
the results of his experience to intending 
farmers and to those other readers who must 
content themselves with enjoying his book 
without yielding to "the lure of the land." 
Comparatively few are those who can wisely 
and successfully follow his example in taking 
up "farming after fifty," but there are thou- 
sands of younger men, already tilling the soil 
or about to engage in that industry, who 
should be able to profit by the admonition and 
advice of this expert agriculturist.

The war as war w iH n Ot last 

prelude to f orever, and it is not too soon to 
forecast its effect upon society. 
Among those who have sought to pierce the 
veil of the future is Mr. L. Cecil Jane, whose 
volume entitled "The Nations at War: The 
Birth of a New Era" (Button) is a strangely 
optimistic prophecy. If one half of the bless- 
ings that Mr. Jane categorically states will 
follow in the train of this war should actually 
ensue, the nations would have secured them at 
a bargain. The author believes that this war 
will usher in an age of toleration to supersede 
intolerance in the recognition of nationalism, 
and of voluntary assent in place of coercion in 
government. These two substitutions will ful- 
fil all the law and the prophets ; arbitration 
will settle international and domestic disputes ; 
militarism will perish, because the fallacy of 
entrusting the maintenance of peace to an 
armed camp has been exposed; the work of 
the French Revolution will be consummated 
in the triumph of democracy; strikes will be 
no more, because employer and employee will 
approach each other as friends with common 
interests ; the sexes will be on a legal equality ; 
the agencies of culture, religion, and govern- 
ment will all press forward with new ideals of 
tolerant cooperation ; statesmen will be sought, 
rather than party-men, by an electorate which 
has a new sense of values. Few readers will 
go all the way to his Utopia with Mr. Jane, but 
one may catch something of his enthusiasm, 
and be the better for it. If the world is going 
to be better after this war, as it must be, not 
one man but millions of men must have the 
faith and the optimism of Mr. Jane. The only 
way that one may sit in the present darkness 
with any comfort is to believe that the light of 
a better day is about to break in men 's hearts. 
It is encouraging that such a book as this 
should find a publisher at the present time. 

Health in its The socialization of medicine in- 
social aspects volves not only the application 
lce - of the discoveries of biological 
and medical sciences in the fields of public 
and social hygiene, sanitation, and preventive 
medicine, but also the creation of a sound pub- 
lic opinion based on a knowledge and appre- 
ciation of the discoveries of the past few years 
which are revolutionizing medical science and 
practice. One of the main factors in the crea- 
tion of such a public opinion is the ability to 
command a hearing in this day of health fad- 
dists and of negations. Dr. Woods Hutchin- 
son wields so trenchant a pen that his readers 
are always interested and entertained, if not 
convinced. Unstilted, untechnical, versatile, 
and rich in allusion to affairs past and pres- 
ent, he challenges the mind of his reader by 



the brilliancy and piquancy of his attack, the 
wealth of his material, and the forcefulness 
with which he repeatedly drives home the sig- 
nificant conclusions regarding diseases and 
their social consequences. His latest volume 
of essays, "Civilization and Health" (Hough- 
ton) , is a rapid-fire defence of the new science 
of preventive medicine, of the utilization of 
guinea pigs in medical research, and of the 
feminist movement in so far as it offers a 
wider field of action for women and is based 
on a candid recognition of the physical differ- 
ences between men and women in their nervous 
organization and limitations. He also takes up 
the cudgels for the employer's interest in the 
employee's health, the regulation of industry 
from the standpoint of hygiene and health, 
personal and national, lends a hand to the 
"swat the fly" and pure milk campaigns, and 
has a good word to say for the vacation habit 
and the out-of-door life. Such books make for 
intelligent citizenship, and for efficiency in the 
hygienic functioning of the body politic.

States, with Russia, with Japan, and with the 
Far East in general. There is not in the essays 
much that is new or anything that is profound. 
There is a good deal that is inaccurate. For 
example, in the opening paragraph of "The 
Overtaxed Melting-Pot" we are told that the 
immigration measure vetoed in 1913 by Presi- 
dent Taft imposed a literacy test upon every 
alien coming to the United States, when as a 
matter of fact large numbers of newcomers 
(relatives of admissible aliens) were specifi- 
cally exempted. And one wonders by what 
sort of prescience the author came to the 
knowledge that this measure, re-introduced in 
the present Congress, would "in time become 
a law with the sanction of President Wilson. ' ' 
The work of the Immigration Commission of 
1907 is unjustly criticized, and the essay is in 
other respects at fault. All in all, one cannot 
repress the observation that if these papers 
were to be reprinted, they should first have 
been revised and corrected.

THE DIAX, 



[Feb. 16 



A camera 
actress in 
West Africa. 



The cinematograph is playing 
no small part in undermining 
the reading habit and lessening 
the demand for printed books, particularly 
among the rising generation. It is therefore 
somewhat refreshing to discover from the pen 
of a "movie" actress a serious book devoted to 
the writer's experiences in West African 
wilds while collecting films depicting native 
life, and when posing as the white heroine in 
Anglo- African cinematograph dramas in con- 
junction with Major Schomburgk. Miss M. 
Gehrts's "A Camera Actress in the Wilds of 
Togoland" (Lippincott) is written with little 
stress on the professional aspects of the au- 
thor's remarkable trip into the remotest cor- 
ners of this German colony. It is, rather, an 
extensively illustrated narrative of the jour- 
ney of a very observant woman, observant 
especially of German efficiency in matters of 
health and sanitation, of the development of 
commerce and industry, and discipline of the 
native peoples under their control. She is 
chiefly interested in human nature, and as a 
result her narrative is concerned more with 
the incidents of the expedition than with the 
natural features of the country she explored. 
Her excellent photographs and interesting 
chapters tell us little of the wild life of the 
jungle, but are replete with accounts of the 
native tribes. 

Talks on life "The College Course and the 
lli C cMw er Preparation for Life" (Hough- 
president, ton) is a series of eight talks 
delivered at Williams College by Dr. Albert 
Parker Fitch, president of the Faculty of 
Andover Theological Seminary. The volume 
is heartily to be recommended for its sane, 
stimulating, and vivid discussion of the life 
and the ideals of college students. President 
Fitch writes with a candor and an undeviating 
directness which must appeal to even the most 
blase of young men. Fearlessly, nobly, and 
with good will for all youth, in his chapter 
entitled "The Fight for Character" the au- 
thor searches with explicit analysis the very 
heart of the temptations of college life, and 
offers wise counsel to those who are dwarfed 
and cramped by unworthy standards. Whether 
read by collegians or by others, the book will 
prove an ardent and undidactic call to higher 
ideals. The chapters on religious experience, 
as well as those on "The Distaste for the 
Beautiful" and "Is Learning Essential?" re- 
veal much that is profoundly significant in 
the trend of modern life. Here, and through- 
out the book, the keen idealism of a tolerant 
yet critical observer gives special zest to all 
that President Fitch has to say. 



Sir J. G. Frazer's selection of Addison's Essays, 
which Messrs. Macmillan have in press, will be 
published in two volumes in the " Eversley Series." 

Professor Roland G. Usher's " Pan- American- 
ism: A Forecast of the Inevitable Clash between 
the United States and Europe's Victor " appears 
among the March announcements of the Century 
Co. 

" Chaucer and His Poetry," by Professor George 
Lyman Kittredge, and " Mediaeval Spanish Alle- 
gory," by Dr. Chandler B. Post, are two volumes 
announced for immediate issue by the Harvard 
University Press. 

" The Healing of Nations " is the title of Mr. 
Edward Carpenter's new volume of essays which 
is announced for early issue. In the volume are 
essays on " Psychology of War and Recruiting," 
" War and Lust," and " Conscription." 

Mr. Stephen Graham's articles on the Russian 
Empire of to-day, and its share in the Great War, 
will be republished in a new volume entitled 
" Russia and the World." The work will be illus- 
trated with a series of photogravure plates. 

Mr. Henry Arthur Jones's volume of three short 
plays, which Messrs. George H. Doran Co. have in 
press, is entitled " The Theatre of Ideas." In the 
Introduction the author satirizes the peace move- 
ment and prevalent freak theatre movements of 
the day. 

A collection of "African Adventure Stories " 
will be published almost immediately in this coun- 
try and England. The author is Mr. J. Alden 
Loring, who was field naturalist to the Roosevelt 
African Expedition, and Mr. Roosevelt contributes 
a foreword. 

Miss Evelyn Underbill, who has recently collabo- 
rated with the Indian mystic, Mr. Rabindranath 
Tagore, in the translation of his latest volume, 
" Songs of Kabir," is now at work on a book to be 
entitled " Practical Mysticism," which Messrs. But- 
ton will publish. 

A critical biography of Mr. Edward Carpenter 
has been written by Mr. Edward Lewis, and will be 
one of the books of the early spring. It will con- 
tain a systematic exposition of Mr. Carpenter's 
teaching, together with some personal touches 
which are only possible from the pen of an inti- 
mate friend. 

" The Message of Japan to America," recently 
published by Messrs. Putnam, is to be followed by 
a companion volume entitled, " The Message of the 
United States to Japan," written by several repre- 
sentative citizens of the United States. The same 
publishers announce a study of James Russell 
Lowell as a critic, by Mr. Joseph J. Reilly. 

Among the unusually large number of names of 
prominent English and American novelists repre- 
sented on the spring announcement lists are those 
of Messrs. H. G. Wells, William Locke, E. F. 
Benson, Maurice Hewlett, W. L. Comfort, Arthur 
Bullard ("Albert Edwards"), Frank Harris, 
Joseph Conrad, Eden Phillpotts, and Theodore 
Dreiser.

Mr. Francis Gribble, who was in Luxemburg at 
the outbreak of the war, and is now held by the 
Germans as a prisoner, has a new book coming 
out very soon dealing with " The Royal House of 
Portugal." The author traces the history of the 
House of Braganza back from its earliest days to 
the revolution which resulted in its exile in this 
country. 

Under the title of " The Lonely Nietzsche," the 
Sturgis & Walton Co. will soon publish the second 
and concluding volume of the authorized life of 
Friedrich Nietzsche, written by his sister, Mrs. 
Forster-Nietzsehe. The first volume, " The Young 
Nietzsche," dealt with the years of childhood and 
adolescence of the philosopher; the present book 
recounts the later half of his career. 

The Drama League of America announces a 
prize of one hundred dollars, offered by Miss Kate 
Oglebay, National Chairman of the Junior Work, 
for the best play for children from six to sixteen 
years of age, submitted to the National Committee 
by June 1, 1915, and meeting the requirements out- 
lined in their recent Bulletin. The prize- winning 
play will be published by Messrs. Macmillan, the 
author of it receiving the usual royalties from 
publication. 

The Rev. Fr. C. C. Martindale, S.J., has ac- 
cepted the invitation of Cardinal Bourne and 
Mr. A. C. Benson to write the authorized Life of 
Monsignor R. Hugh Benson. He will be glad to 
receive letters written by Monsignor Benson from 
any who are kind enough to lend them. They may 
be sent to him at Stonyhurst College, Blackburn, 
England, and will in all cases be returned. No 
other biography will be authorized by Monsignor 
Benson's representatives. 

A complete translation of Treitschke's history 
of modern Germany, in five volumes, running to a 
million and a half words, is being arranged by a 
London publisher. It is expected that the first 
volume will be ready in April, and that the work 
will be completed at the rate of one volume every 
three months. For this edition a supplementary 
volume will be written for publication after the 
present war, carrying the narrative from the point 
at which it was left by Treitschke down to the 
declaration of peace. 

Mr. Frederick W. Jenkins, librarian of the 
Russell Sage Foundation Library, wishes other 
librarians to know of his collection of duplicate 
publications on applied sociology. These are 
available for distribution, and full information on 
the subject, together with the first instalment of a 
list of these offered duplicates, will be found in the 
January "Library Journal," which continues the 
list in subsequent numbers. Care has been taken to 
exclude worthless matter from the list, so that Mr. 
Jenkins's offer is something better than an appeal 
for congestion-relief. 

The undertaking of a concordance to the Poeti- 
cal Works of Robert Browning was announced at 
the annual meeting of the Concordance Society of 
America, held at Columbia University, December 
30, 1914. This new work is under the editorship of 
Professor L. N. Broughton of Cornell University 
and Professor B. F. Stelter of the University of 



Southern California, who wish to make this fur- 
ther announcement of their undertaking in order 
to avoid any possible duplication of their labors. 
Communications regarding the work may be ad- 
dressed to Professor L. N. Broughton, Ithaca, N. Y. 

" Fairyland," the opera by Messrs. Brian 
Hooker and Horatio Parker which was awarded 
first prize by the National Committee of the San 
Francisco Exposition, will be published this month 
by the Yale University Press. Other February 
books of this house include a new translation of 
Dante's " Divine Comedy," prepared by Professor 
Henry Johnson ; " Yale Yesterdays," by the late 
Clarence Deming ; " Centenary of the Yale Medi- 
cal School," edited by Dr. William H. Carmalt; 
" Critical Essays of the Eighteenth Century," 
edited by Dr. Willard H. Durham, and the first 
volume of Bracton's " De Legibus et Consuetudini- 
bus Anglise," edited by Professor George E. 
Woodbine. 

The Dunlap Society of New York has planned 
the publication of books and prints relating to the 
American stage. The first publication of the so- 
ciety will be "An Authentic and Impartial Record 
of the Career of Dion Boucicault" by Mr. Town- 
send Walsh. Other volumes soon to be issued 
include "A Memoir of Steele MacKaye," by Mr. 
Percy MacKaye, "A Short Account of the Earlier 
Activities of the Dunlap Society, with a Descrip- 
tive List of Its Publications," by Messrs. Brander 
Matthews and Evert Jansen Wendell, "A History 
of Mitchel's Olympic Theatre " by Mr. Thomas J. 
McKee, and a history of the New York stage from 
1900 to date, of which the first volume will appear 
in the autumn.

A Garden Party 

By ANNIE WOOD FRANCHOT 

A delightful gift for the lovers of flowers and gardens. This 
exquisite little garden phantasy a poem in prose will be a fresh 
delight to all lovers of flowers. Each flower guest as it comes to the 
delightful party has its human characteristic and charm. Even the 
bees and birds lend their music to the scene. All the old favorites 
of our grandmothers' and mothers' gardens are represented at the 
party and all in bright array. It contains a touch of pathos too, 
when the garden party is brought to an abrupt and tragic end by the 
advent of Jack Frost.

transparent wrapper. 50 cents net.

Mr. Clark's biographical and critical study of 
Alexander Wyant is distinguished by a sympathetic 
appreciation of the artist's landscape and a happi- 
ness in the elucidation of its poetic significance that 
will help one to a new understanding of its charac- 
teristic charm. This book fills a real want, for there 
is no other devoted to this great American artist.

know in advance of prize contests, changes in editorial 
policies, suspensions, changes of address, requirements of 
new publications, film manufacturers, etc. Your imagina- 
tion goes no further. A friend of this admirable type would 
have to be superhuman.

Mr. Ernest Poole's New Novel Published February 3 



Third Edition Now Ready 



THE HARBOR 

By Ernest Poole 



Mr. Poole has written a novel of remarkable power and 'vision in 
which are depicted the great changes taking place in American life, 
business and ideals in the present generation. Under the tremendous 
influence of the great New York harbor, with its docks, warehouses, 
its huge liners and its workers, a young writer passes, in the devel- 
opment of his life and work, from a blind worship of enterprise and 
efficiency to a deeper knowledge and understanding of humanity. 



N. Y. Times 

"This first book of his is by 
all odds the best American novel 
that has appeared in many a 
long day. It is earnest, sincere, 
broad in scope and purpose, 
well balanced, combining intel- 
lect and emotion. . . The 
characters are ably drawn, 
strikingly contrasted, essentially 
American. . . Here in this 
vision of the harbor is focused 
much of our modern world, its 
perplexities, its struggles and 
its ideals. . . Mr. Poole may 
be congratulated upon having 
written an absorbingly interest- 
ing and very significant novel. " 

N. Y. Post 

11 Many and varied as are the 
themes that have been woven 
together to make the whole, 
each one is clean cut and fits 
into its right place. 'The Har- 
bor' is well worth reading, both 
for what it gives and the manner 
in which that is given. " 



N. Y. Tribune 



"This is a remarkable book, 
... an achievement in itself. 
It is one of the ablest novels 
added to American fiction in 
many a year. . . The first 
really notable novel produced 
by the new democracy, . . . 
a book of the past and the 
present and the future, not only 
of New York and of this 
country, but of all the world. 
. . Mr. Poole is an author of 
exceptional gifts, of ideas and 
convictions. Let us hope that 
the American reading public, 
which has neglected so many 
new talents among us, will give 
him in fullest measure the recog- 
nition which he so fully de- 
serves. " 

Brooklyn Eagle 

"Mr. Poole is thoroughly in 
earnest, very much in love with 
his subject and he has written a 
sincere and ... an extremely 
vivid story ... a great deal 
of the living New York is in it. " 



N. Y. World 



"A fine new American story, 
in the spirit of the hour. . . 
A work which must be placed at 
once among the rare books that 
count which may prove quite 
possibly to be the distinctive 
American novel of the year. . . 
He finds in the harbor the glory 
and the wretchedness of the 
world, together with a new, vast 
breadth of outlook and a new 
depth of thought. . . The New 
York it presents is no limited 
city, but a vast world centre of 
ideas, ideals, hope, passions and 
struggles." 

- N. Y. Globe 

"Mr. Poole' s story is interest- 
ing on many counts. . . The 
whole is admirably written. . . 
One can say of it what he quotes 
another as giving as his ideal, 
'one more fellow has done his 
best by telling of life as he 
has seen it his changing life 
through his changing eyes.' "

WAR AND POETRY. 



A German visitor came to the United 
States not long ago for the purpose of sound- 
ing American sentiment upon the subject of 
the great war. After some weeks of investiga- 
tion, during which he interviewed many peo- 
ple in the various walks of life, and read his 
fill of newspaper and magazine comment, he 
became a very despondent and chastened per- 
son. In conversation one day, the discussion 
turned upon the bankruptcy of German diplo- 
macy in the weeks preceding the outbreak of 
hostilities, and it was suggested to him that 
the capital error of his country was to be found 
in its failure to understand the psychology of 
the English people. He admitted the justice 
of the criticism, and added with a sigh : "We 
did not know how they hated us," thereby 
affording an illustration more striking than 
any argument in its illumination of the charge. 

Now we knew very well how the Germans 
hate the English. The passion is expressed in 
thousands of sayings, both private and official, 
that have of late found issue from the German 
mind, and is a national attitude merely crys- 
tallized in Herr Ernst Lissauer's "Hassge- 
sang, ' ' which has been so adroitly turned into 
English and so widely read. When this truly 
hateful poem came to the attention of the 
English public, it was accompanied (in a letter 
to "The Spectator") by an expression of 
naive surprise that it should have been first 
published in "Jugend," which from its title 
would seem to be "a magazine for boys and 
girls." So even the most ghastly subjects are 
sometimes lighted up by flashes of unconscious 
humor. Probably no German in these heated 
days could grasp the simple and obvious truth 
that an outburst against Germany in Herr 
Lissauer's violent strain could not possibly be 
a product of the English mind. We can read- 
ily imagine an Englishman of the type, say, 
of Mr. Galsworthy or Mr. Watson or Mr. Hew- 
lett, countering with an entirely sincere and 
heartfelt "Liebesgesang" for the country of 
the enemy although such an expression 
would of course be addressed to the Germany 
of Goethe and Schiller, of Beethoven and 
Wagner, of Kant and Schopenhauer, the coun-

try of the soul cherished in countless English 
hearts, rather than to the Germany of 
Treitschke and Bernhardi and the Prussian 
Kaiser, or of the excited German professors 
whose manifesto last autumn was such a 
shock to the moral consciousness of the world's 
commonwealth of ideas. In very truth, no one 
who has the least understanding of the En- 
glish psychology believes that its attitude 
toward the Germans is one of hatred. It hates 
the evil of the German policies and pedantic 
methods of warfare, but it retains a deep and 
genuine sympathy for the German people, and 
does not withhold from them its meed of praise 
for their valor in arms, for their self-sacrifice 
and devotion to the Fatherland, and for the 
beau geste that occasionally shines out through 
the murk of the strife. Those who imagine 
that Englishmen hate the Germans are of the 
purblind tribe who find in the "Divine 
Comedy" merely a record of Dante's personal 
hatreds, and the expression of his vindictive- 
ness toward his enemies. Meanwhile, a differ- 
ent sort of counter to the attack is provided 
from America in Miss Helen Gray Cone's 
beautiful "Song of Love for England," pub- 
lished in "The Atlantic Monthly" a month 
ago. 

The relations between poetry and war have 
long been a subject of literary discussion and 
even of controversy. There are some who hold 
that such a flowering of a nation's passion as 
is manifested by its participation in war is 
bound to arouse and stimulate the poetical 
faculty to unwonted exaltations of expression. 
By a careful process of selection, the facts may 
often be made to fit in with this thesis, and 
give it plausible support. On the other hand, 
a broader view will tend to dislodge such a 
conclusion, and lead us back to the proposition 
that the wind of the spirit of genius ' ' bloweth 
where it listeth, " and that no historical syn- 
thesis can establish a sure relation (except for 
Tyrtaean strains) between the agony of war 
and the agony whereby the poet's mind is 
impelled to teach in song what it has learned 
in suffering. 

" Vex thou not the poet's mind 

With thy shallow wit," 

is an injunction that may profitably be laid 
upon the theorists who are disposed to formu- 
late rules upon which the poetic faculty per- 
force must act. 

Our own Civil War, one of the greatest in 
history until all comparisons were dwarfed by 



the horror of last autumn, now still upon the 
world, affords a case in point. It must be ad- 
mitted that Browne's "Bugle Echoes," which 
represents the best possible gleaning from that 
field of endeavor, is a work that contains very 
little poetry of enduring value. We who knew 
the poems of the Civil War period when they 
came white-hot from the heart and imagina- 
tion of their singers, are still reluctant to 
acquiesce in any appraisal that allows them 
no more than their eternal and objective value, 
but there remain, after all, very few pieces 
that belong to the world's golden treasury. 
Lowell's "Commemoration Ode" and Whit- 
man's "When lilacs last in the dooryard 
bloomed," are about all that we are sure of. 
to which, for our inglorious little war of a 
later date, must be added Moody 's "Ode in 
Time of Hesitation." Mr. Stedman seems to 
have said the last word of wisdom upon this 
subject: 

" The late Civil War was not of itself an incen- 
tive to good poetry and art, nor directly productive 
of them. Such disorders seldom are; action is a 
substitute for the ideal, and the thinker's or dream- 
er's life seems ignoble and repugnant. But we shall 
see that the moral and emotional conflicts preceding 
the war, and leading to it, were largely stimulating 
to poetic ardor; they broke into expression, and 
buoyed with earnest and fervid sentiment our 

heroic verse The Civil War was a general 

absorbent at the crisis when a second group of 
poets began to form. The conflict not only checked 
the rise of a new school, but was followed by a time 
of languor in which the songs of Apollo seemed 
trivial to those who had listened to the shout of 
Mars." 

We cannot, then, predict with any assurance 
that the world war of this year will bear 
the fruit of a poetical renascence. If it should, 
the ripening will be slow, and the harvest long 
delayed. There is no indication that the poet 
for the occasion now exists anywhere unless 
he be M. Verhaeren as the poet was found 
in 1870-71 in the person of Victor Hugo, who 
forged "L'Annee Terrible" in the white heat 
of his passionate indignation. No one seems 
capable just now of getting the right perspec- 
tive, or striking a deeper note than that of 
vehemence and outraged sensibility. Probably 
the finest poem occasioned by the Franco- 
Prussian war was George Meredith's "France 
in December, 1870," written at the time, it is 
true, but with so deep and comprehensive an 
understanding of its theme that it now reads 
like the verdict of the ages. But we scan the 
horizon in vain for a Meredith in this super- 
terrible year.

All this does not mean that the poets, such 
as they are, have been silent during the past 
half-year. They have risen promptly, even too 
promptly, to the appeal, and dashed off com- 
positions innumerable showing their hearts to 
be in the right place (Tipperary or else- 
where), but not often reaching the heights of 
which their previous performances have shown 
them capable. The flow of their rhymes has 
too often been turgid, and its waters anything 
but crystal-clear. Now and then, indeed, as in 
Mr. Barry Pain's lines on "The Kaiser and 
God," we get a really impressive bit of verse: 

" Impious braggart, you forget ; 
God is not your conscript yet; 
You shall learn in dumb amaze 
That His ways are not your ways, 
That the mire through which you trod 
Is not the high white road of God, 

To Whom, whichever way the combat rolls, 
We, fighting to the end, commend our souls." 

But it must be admitted that the poetry of the 
war has thus far proved a disappointment. 
The output of English verse upon this theme 
seems to deserve, as a whole, the treatment 
given it in these lines by a London journalist : 
" Has Robert Bridges's success with fighting 

Been such as to encourage emulation? 
Or Dr. Watson's ' bit them in the Bight '-ing? 
Or the same author's other lucubration 
(Yet one more blow for a disthressful nation) 
In which, dead gravelled for a rhyme for ' Ireland,' 
He struggled out with ' motherland and sireland ' ? 

" Did even the voice from Rudyard Kipling's shelf 
Say anything it had not said before? 

And was not Stephen Phillips just himself? 
And was not Newbolt's effort on the war 
Distinctly less effective than of yore? 

And would not German shrapnel in the leg be 

Less lacerating than the verse of Begbie ? " 

After all, poets exist by the grace of God, 
and neither war nor any other fortuitous cir- 
cumstance can create them. If they are on 
hand in a great spiritual crisis like the pres- 
ent, well and good; but we must not expect 
them to be struck off from the mint of human 
potentiality even by such a struggle as the 
present, in which all the interests and ideals 
that civilization holds dear are at stake. The 
real singers of the present cataclysm may be 
yet unborn, and that Weltgericht which it is 
the peculiar mission of the poet to pronounce 
upon it may not find expression until the hor- 
rors of this war have become as 

" Old, unhappy, far-off things, 
And battles long ago."

CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE ROAD TO AUTHORSHIP is of varying 
length. Some writers produce books in their 
early 'teens, while others, not less endowed 
with the vision and the faculty divine, yet 
want the accomplishment of book-writing, 
and die with only a meagre magazine article 
or two to their credit. An instance not at all 
belonging in this latter class comes to our 
attention. In 1890 a young colored man of 
Alabama w.as so fortunate as to find himself 
in the neighborhood of Tuskegee and yielded 
to the impulse to seek an interview with Mr. 
Booker Washington, in the hope of gaining 
admittance to the Institute under the latter 's 
superintendence. In answer to certain ques- 
tions put to him as an entrance examination, 
the young man was unable even to tell the 
county or the state or the nation in which he 
lived, and when interrogated as to the parts 
of speech he answered that they were the lips, 
teeth, tongue, and throat. Nevertheless he 
was admitted to the Tuskegee Institute and 
was put to work at stripping fodder from 
sorghum cane. It is this member of our large 
negro population who now comes before the 
book-reading public as author of "The Black 
Man's Burden," evidently a not insignificant 
piece of work, to which the Principal of Tus- 
kegee contributes an introduction, and which 
one critic pronounces to be "among the six 
greatest works by members of the negro race" 
that he has read. Mr. William H. Holtzclaw 
for he is the author was graduated from 
Tuskegee in 1898, and has since then founded 
and built up the Utica Normal and Industrial 
Institute, at Utica, Mississippi, which to-day 
has more than five hundred pupils, taught by 
thirty-five instructors, and owns 1700 acres of 
land, with fourteen buildings. And less than 
twenty-five years ago the head of this great 
school and the author of the notable book that 
has served as text to these rather desultory re- 
marks did not know the parts of speech. 


SEEKERS AFTER CURIOUS AND RARE BITS OF 
INFORMATION furnish more occupation to ref- 
erence-room attendants than all other persons 
combined. Experience in library work has 
proved that there is almost no imaginable 
query that may not at any time be sprung 
upon the supposedly omniscient librarian or 
some member of his staff. For instance, 
earnest inquiry was once made, in our hearing, 
at a certain public library, concerning the 
color of the Due de Reichstadt's hair and eyes, 
and as to whether his hair was curly or 
straight; and another inquirer wished to- 
know how much port wine was consumed m

England in the year 1716. No veteran library 
worker would be surprised or very much dis- 
concerted at being abruptly asked whether 
Queen Elizabeth was in the habit of putting 
her right shoe on before her left, or the re- 
verse ; or whether dentistry was known to the 
ancient Egyptians; or what proportion of 
those wounded in the battle of Hastings died 
of their injuries. In order to meet with smil- 
ing confidence such manifestations of extraor- 
dinary thirst for knowledge, libraries are now 
more and more following the practice of index- 
ing and classifying their available stores of 
out-of-the-way information. The Chicago 
Public Library has begun a "Facts and Fig- 
ures Index" of this nature. From a week's 
list of inquiries it publishes a few sample ques- 
tions on the preparation of peanuts for mar- 
ket, the number of buildings erected in large 
cities in 1913, the regulations for packing 
motion-picture films for shipping, the rise in 
real-estate values, the amount of food con- 
sumed by the nations at war, the number 
of deaths attributable to alcohol, and other 
equally interesting matters. If one would 
learn the vast range and variety of his own 
ignorance, let him serve for a week as refer- 
ence librarian in a large library. 

AN EMBARRASSING OBLIGATION that has often 
made itself felt outside the library world is 
the subject of some editorial remarks in the 
"Library Occurrent" the quarterly publica- 
tion of the Indiana Public Library Commis- 
sion. After giving suggestions for district 
meetings of library workers, the writer refers 
to two reasons that "clearly seem to have 
deterred some districts from meeting oftener : 
difficulty in finding an easily accessible meet- 
ing place, and fear of social obligations con- 
nected with the meeting." As to the latter 
reason, "District meetings are professional 
meetings, and, though there is properly a so- 
cial atmosphere when friends meet, there 
should be no attempt on the part of the host 
to furnish refreshments or entertainment. 
Unquestionably, such hospitality adds much to 
the pleasure of the meeting, but the expressed 
opinions of many librarians make as unques- 
tionable the fact that many librarians whose 
boards are unwilling to pay for such entertain- 
ment and who themselves cannot afford to do 
so, feel it impossible to invite the district to 
meet with them. Either such entertaining 
should be entirely omitted or the district itself, 
if it so votes, should contribute towards the 
expense." Possibly a useful hint might here 
be conveyed by citing the example of the 
charming Mrs. Ware (wife of the author of 
"Zenobia," "Julian," and other books now 



too little read) who by her graces and accom- 
plishments as hostess could so delight those 
who gathered about her rather meagre board 
that they became unaware whether they were 
partaking of simple bread and butter and tea 
or were feasting on ambrosia and nectar, but 
with a subsequent impression that it had been 
ambrosia and nectar. 



THE PASSION FOR TEXTUAL CRITICISM has un- 
doubtedly been indulged in with less restraint 
by German scholars than by the scholars of 
any other country, and the stock illustration 
of this passion raised to its highest power is 
the traditional but unauthenticated instance 
of the learned Teuton who devoted a lifetime 
to the study and explanation, of a certain 
punctuation mark in an ancient manuscript, 
only to discover at the very end that it was 
nothing but a fly-speck after all. A conspicu- 
ous example of industry and zeal in textual 
criticism was the late Ingram Bywater, for- 
merly Regius Professor of Greek at Oxford, 
who died in one of the last days of the past 
year, and whose titles and honors and list of 
scholarly publications make a most impressive 
showing. He edited with microscopic care the 
fragments of Heraclitus, the works of Pris- 
cianus Lydus, Aristotle's "Nicomachean 
Ethics" and "Poetics," and wrote a treatise 
on the textual criticism of the "Ethics." But 
it was his work on the ' ' Poetics ' ' that consti- 
tuted his magnum opus, though that frag- 
mentary disquisition itself is but an opuscule, 
an inconsiderable item in the list of Aristotle 's 
works. Years of painstaking research were 
devoted to this task, and it was not until 1897, 
when Bywater was fifty-seven years old, that 
he ventured to give to the world his recension 
of the text, with critical commentary. Then 
followed a dozen years of further study of the 
Aristotelian text, after which, in 1909, he 
issued his final enlarged and emended work 
on the "Poetics," accompanied by a transla- 
tion and elaborate commentary. From that 
time until his death he had lived, more em- 
phatically than before, the life of a scholarly 
recluse among his books, in his home at Onslow 

Square, London. 



JUVENILE DISRESPECT FOR LITERARY PROP- 
ERTY, or, in plainer language, young people's 
tendency to steal books, has compelled the 
trustees of the Cambridge (Mass.) Public 
Library to discontinue, so far as the children 
of that city of culture are concerned, the free- 
dom of access to bookshelves which is the glory 
and the pride of those library workers who like 
to believe that the great public is becoming 
more and more intelligently and conscien-

tiously responsive to the increasing opportuni- 
ties and privileges extended to it by those who 
purvey to its literary needs. An inventory, 
the first one in five years, has lately been com- 
pleted in the juvenile department of the Cam- 
bridge library, and it reveals a loss, by theft 
or otherwise, of more than a thousand vol- 
umes. Hence the trustees' action in enclosing 
the formerly open children's shelves. "The 
new arrangement," reports the librarian, "is 
working admirably from the point of view of 
both the children and the attendants. Its 
economic, administrative and educational ad- 
vantages seem already assured. It makes 
practicable the keeping of the books in better 
condition, and the room in better order. It 
enables the attendants to know that a book not 
in its proper place on the shelves is really out 
and not merely misplaced. It tends, by empha- 
sizing our own care for the books, to make the 
children more reverent and careful of them. 
Above all, it obviates the moral risk involved 
in an arrangement which, because of the struc- 
tural plan of the room, permitted among chil- 
dren frequent and undetected thefts." It 
may be that these children will value their 
later and less restricted library privileges the 
more highly for this early curb to their law- 
lessness. ... 

FRENCH POETRY AND GERMAN POETRY were 
once compared, or contrasted, by Edward 
Rowland Sill, in humorously realistic phrase, 
in one of his familiar letters. He said : "I am 
coming to believe the Germans an unpoetic 
people even their greatest poets are pretty 
wordy and dull and clumsy. But there is a 
school of modern French poets worth trans- 
lating. I have been doing some of Sully Prud- 
homme, for instance. It is to the Germans 
as cloud-fluff to cheese. ' ' In the same vein 
one of his published bits of prose has this: 
"Perhaps the best topics on which to feel the 
difference are those two immemorial inspirers 
of song, war and love. "When the German poet 
sings of war, it is with the solemnity of 
Korner's 'Gebet wahrend der Schlacht. ' 
When the French poet sings of it, it is with 
the ' Gai ! Gai ! ' of Beranger. In the one, you 
hear the heavy tread of men, a dull, regular 
beat, which, after all, is not very distinguish- 
able to the ear, as to whether it be an advanc- 
ing column or a funeral march. In the other 
you hear only the bugles ringing and shouts of 
enthusiasm and excitement." In what fol- 
lows the Germans seem to have the better of 
it; or are the French here, too, more truly 
poetic? "In their treatment of love there is 
even sharper contrast. The German word 
Liebe has quite a different atmosphere of sug- 
gestion from the French amour. The German 



poet sings of love and home; you feel that 
there is at least a possibility that the passion 
of to-day will outlast the year, or the years. 
Constancy is one of its very elements. When 
the French poet sings of love, it is very deli- 
cate, rosy, beautiful, but we do not hear of 
home." These quotations are from the just- 
published biography of Sill, reviewed on an- 
other page. 

READERS BEHIND THE BARS of prison cells 
make a peculiar appeal to the library worker, 
and library-extension activities in our penal 
institutions are increasing at an encouraging 
rate. Stone walls do not a prison make, nor 
iron bars a cage, to a convict absorbed in a 
good book. To the old school of penologists 
this would seem to be an argument for with- 
holding the good book, but luckily the ten- 
dency now is to lessen the rigors of incarcera- 
tion in various reformatory ways, including 
the influence of wholesome literature. In the 
"Seventh Biennial Report of the Nebraska 
Public Library Commission" a very readable 
section treats of the Commission 's supervision 
of libraries in State institutions. Here is a 
passage : "In writing of his library work with 
the men at the penitentiary, one of our former 
librarians says, 'A prison library can be the 
drive wheel on the engine of discipline. ' This 
same man, whose first introduction to a library 
was in our state prison, after his release sent 
in from one of our far western counties for a 
traveling library for the girls and boys of the 
community. The books had to be hauled thirty 
miles from the railroad. This fall he sent for 
another library and sent an additional request 
for books for the nearest school. Still later, 
another request was received from this same 
district. "We are' proud indeed of the work 
this man is voluntarily doing and to know 
that his interest in libraries is a permanent 
one." It needs but a glance at a library map 
of Nebraska, where whole counties are still 
library-less, to demonstrate the opportunity 
there offered for an unlimited amount of such 
library-extension work as this ex-convict is 
now so zealously doing. 



.THE PLACE OF CRITICISM in the scheme of 
things is one to which the critics themselves 
are, naturally enough, prone to ascribe too 
much importance. In a current magazine 
article on "The Acid of Criticism" the Rev. 
Hugh Black says some things that apply not 
only to Bible criticism, which is his main 
theme, but also to literary criticism in general 
and, in fact, to criticism in a still more inclu- 
sive sense. It is well to be reminded, now and 
then, that criticism commonly, though not 



138 



THE DIAL, 



[ March 4 



always, "deals with the fringe, the methods 
and the outward manifestations of life. There 
is room for criticism, for thought, for reason 
in the unfathomable depths of divine truth, 
but these do not generate the truth. It is 
intuitive. The child, the ignorant, the un- 
learned may see it. It is to be seen, not argued 
about. Men spoke before the laws of gram- 
mar were propounded. Men reasoned before 
Aristotle built up logic. Men sang before the 
theory of music was dreamed of. Men ate 
before the chemistry of edibles was studied. 
Men believed before the theology was built up 
into a system to formulate their faith. The 
explanation may be difficult, but the thing 
itself is simple. The science of it may be im- 
perfect and hard, but the thing itself is intui- 
tive a flash, a gleam, an inspiration, an act. ' ' 
Those who believe that the first duty of criti- 
cism is to be constructive and not destructive, 
positive and not negative, sympathetic and 
generously appreciative rather than antipa- 
thetic and grudgingly laudatory, will enjoy 
reading in full the utterance here fragmen- 
tarily cited. It is to be found in the February 
number of "Everybody's Magazine." 



BOOKS AS FOOD FOR THE FLAMES are expen- 
sive fuel. The number of valuable libraries 
that, partly or wholly, have in recent years 
gone up in smoke is larger than most people 
would suspect. The fire in the Wisconsin 
State House destroyed several department 
libraries and the travelling library collections 
there in store. The Maryland Institute lost by 
fire a rich collection of works on art and archi- 
tecture, more than twenty thousand volumes 
in all. McGill University suffered a like de- 
struction of its medical library; the Spring- 
field (Mass.) City Library has experienced a 
serious loss by damage to its books by fire; 
Turin's ancient university had one hundred 
thousand volumes of its library reduced to 
ashes; a branch of the St. Louis Public 
Library was wiped out by fire ; San Francisco 
lost its public library by earthquake and fire ; 
the Equitable Life Insurance Society of New 
York, after forming what was esteemed a 
unique library in its special department, saw 
it fall a prey to the flames; the Paterson 
(N. J.) Public Library was totally destroyed 
by fire ; the library of the University of Vir- 
ginia suffered a like fate ; and, to cap the cli- 
max, the State Library at Albany, N. Y., the 
most important collection of its kind in the 
country, fed to the flames nearly half a million 
volumes, more than quarter of a million manu- 
scripts, and three hundred thousand pam- 
phlets. These rather startling proofs of 



"hindsight" in the fireproofing of libraries are 
cited by the Michigan Library Association in 
an appeal to the State Legislature to provide 
safe quarters for the Michigan State Library 
at Lansing. 

COMMON SENSE IN BIBLIOGRAPHY needs to be 
preached to the enthusiastic bibliographer. 
Here is a wise word from the current number 
of ' ' The Papers of the Bibliographical Society 
of America," the writer being Mr. Frederick 
W. Jenkins : "To my mind the greatest need 
is not more of the mechanical records of every 
good, bad, and indifferent publication, but an 
indication of really important articles and 
pamphlets, as well as books. In using such 
records I find nine-tenths of the entries only 
an annoyance. The scholarly tendency to put 
down every conceivable thing is like the crazy 
librarian who saves everything in type. The 
real service to the public is to make a list of 
the things one really needs to read. It is a 
mighty unimportant thing practically to peo- 
ple to see a catalogue of everything that has 
been printed on a certain point; 99 per cent, 
of the value rests in finding what there is that 
is worth consulting. ' ' This is from an article 
on "Bibliography and its Relation to Social 
Work" a not very obvious relation at first 
thought, but still existent, else Mr. Jenkins 
could not have filled four octavo pages on the 
subject. Other papers in the same issue are 
a "Bibliographical Outline of French-Cana- 
dian Literature," by Mr. James Geddes, Jr.,

ONE OF THE FAMOUS LAWSUITS OF FICTION IS 

recalled to the novel-reader's mind by the 
recent death of David Jennings in the work- 
house at Wolverhampton, England. He was 
of rather more than local celebrity as the 
claimant to the ' ' Jennings millions, ' ' a Bir- 
mingham estate long held in rather precarious 
possession, and at an immense cost for legal de- 
fence, by the descendants of Lady Andover and 
Earl Howe ; or at least that is the current ac- 
count of the matter. Dickens 's famous case of 
" Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce" in "Bleak House," 
the wearisome Chancery suit "never ending, 
still beginning," is said to be taken from the 
Jennings controversy over the Birmingham 
property. William Jennings, or Jennens, 
known as "William the Rich," accumulated 
wealth to the extent of about eight million 
dollars, and also owned extensive tracts of

land in what is now the centre of Birming- 
ham. He died in 1798, and the greater part 
of this handsome property passed to the two 
persons named above, who claimed to be the 
next of kin. From that time until about forty 
years ago there was almost constant litigation 
over the disputed millions, and a goodly share 
thereof was spent in keeping them out of the 
avid Jenningses' hands which, for aught 
one knows, may have been the hands rightly 
entitled to them. But with the death of poor 
David in the workhouse the likelihood of fur- 
ther legal dispute over the famous property 
seems to have disappeared. 



BOOKS "NEVER IN" are naturally regarded 
by many disappointed library-frequenters as 
nothing but a snare and a delusion. The latest 
quarterly bulletin of the Carnegie Library of 
Atlanta prints some observations and direc- 
tions in regard to these elusive works of litera- 
ture, remarking with truth that "nothing is 
more discouraging than to go to the library 
several times in a vain attempt to find a book, ' ' 
and informing the reader how, at the expense 
of one cent for a postal card, to secure the 
reservation of such book, unless it be a novel 
not in the rent collection, at the earliest pos- 
sible moment. Some libraries undertake to 
reserve for applicants all novels except recent 
accessions ; others go so far as to reserve even 
these upon request ; and we recall one library 
where instruction was issued from high quar- 
ters to the desk attendants to make a note of all 
books, of whatever kind, applied for unsuccess- 
fully, with names and addresses of the appli- 
cants, and to reserve these books as fast as they 
came in, at the same time notifying the appli- 
cants that the books asked for were now avail- 
able. Any library worker can easily imagine 
the rapidly increasing congestion and confu- 
sion that speedily resulted in the department 
undertaking this record. Only a quiet and dis- 
creet disobedience of the rule, in all its rigor, 
saved the desk attendants from insanity and 
the circulation department from paralysis.

LITERARY DIPLOMATS from the United States 
of America are at present filling positions call- 
ing for the greatest practical sagacity and 
untiring energy as well as the utmost tact and 
diplomacy. A more difficult task than that 
imposed for the past six months on our Bel- 
gian minister could hardly be imagined. 
Probably Mr. Whitlock's previous "forty 
years of it" will seem as child's play to him 
when contrasted with this subsequent shorter 
period, which ought to furnish a supplement 
to that earlier narrative far more thrilling 
than anything recorded in those noteworthy 



chapters. Dr. van Dyke, too, at The Hague, 
must have been acquiring a store of raw mate- 
rial for future literary use such as falls to the 
lot of few writers. Mr. Walter Page, also, 
trained to the labors of the pen before he 
essayed those of the ambassador, is in the very 
heart of things at London, and may be reck- 
oned upon to give some interesting account of 
himself one of these days. Our other Ambas- 
sador Page, at Rome, is somewhat removed 
from the crash and the din ; but even his sit- 
uation is not without its possibilities, and 
something in the form of fiction, or perhaps of 
most interesting diary or reminiscence, will be 
expected from him to show how far he has 
been awake to his enviable opportunities. 


THE LIBRARY AS PACIFICATOR has a duty to 
perform, as we are reminded by an editorial 
note in the current "Quarterly Booklist" of 
the Pratt Institute Free Library, second only 
in importance to its duty as educator. Or 
perhaps the order of importance should be 
reversed. At any rate, the Pratt Institute 
librarian holds that ' ' the Library is an instru- 
mentality for peace," and continues: "Our 
recently published list of books dealing with 
the historical, social and economic issues that 
led to the European eruption is intended to be 
an argument for peace. Without infraction 
of 'neutrality,' the exercise of private judg- 
ment as to the righteousness of the opposing 
contentions is encouraged by the extensive 
literature the Library affords on both sides of 
the case. We invite open-minded reading that 
may lead to the ultimate conviction of the 
unrighteousness of war upon any pretext, and 
the futility of it as a means of deliverance 
from the ills of the world." The writer opti- 
mistically expects the forthcoming peace 
(when it does come) to be "not a truce under 
arms, a calm of suspended hostilities, the 
quiet of exhaustion, the silence of repression, 
but the permanent abolition of warfare with 
all its paraphernalia. ' ' If abundance of read- 
ing matter on subjects of war and peace could 
insure that desirable end, even a cursory 
glance at the array of such literature exposed 
to view in most of our public libraries would 
encourage hopes of a speedy dawn of a new 
era in the world's history. 



A SET-BACK TO SIMPLIFIED SPELLING, in En- 
gland at least, is what the war seems in some 
measure to be, if one may judge from an 
"editorial noet" in the latest issue of "The 
Pioneer ov Simplified Speling." Until the 
return of "pees" (good Chaucerian orthog- 
raphy, by the way) the paper will be published 
bi-monthly instead of every month. As a pos-

sibly interesting curiosity, and as a lesson in 
the trans-oceanic form of unorthodox spelling,

may like to see enjoying such publicity as we

THE LUEE OF THE EDITION DE LUXE, despite 
repeated warnings from those who know the 
perils and pitfalls awaiting the innocent vic- 
tims, still shows itself to be irresistible in a 
surprising number of instances. The federal 
district court at New York has recently found 
guilty two men engaged in the sale of books 
alleged to be of great rarity and value, the 
charge brought against the defendants being, 
of course, that of illegally using the mails for 
the advertising and sale of their spurious 
goods. More than ten million dollars, it is 
believed, has been thus fraudulently obtained 
by these culprits and others from too credu- 
lous buyers, who were assured that, if they 
desired, their purchases would be resold for 
them at a handsome profit to European book- 
lovers eager to secure such precious examples 
of the art of book-manufacture. In vain the 
net is spread in the sight of any bird, but the 
very obvious snare of the edition de luxe needs 
no concealment when so many foolish persons 
show such a predilection for being caught in 
its toils.

new Bureau of Printing which is at last assum- 
ing definite shape after several years' tenta- 
tive discussion. Here, then, instead of outside 
the academic bounds as hitherto, the product 
of the literary activity, or a considerable part 
of it, of the professors and other university 
members addicted to writing, will be put into 
printed form ; and for the present, at least, the 
bursar will superintend the work, having al- 
ready gained experience in the conduct of a 



small printing office in East Hall, where much 
of the incidental printing of the university 
has been done. The basement of the school of 
journalism will be used as quarters for the new 
establishment. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



A FRENCH FEMINIST OF TO-DAY.* 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The novels of Madame Marcelle Tinayre have 
received little notice from American critics, but 
have aroused considerable discussion in France. 
She is hailed by the feminists as a champion of 
their cause, a fact which may give her some title 
to interest on this side of the water. At least it is 
interesting to note the trend of her theories of 
woman's rights. " The only feminism possible," 
says a reviewer of her first work, " Before Love " 
(1897), "would be that which strives to keep 
woman in the unique religion of Love." Mme. 
Tinayre seems to have accepted the views of her 
critic, for her novels are a justification and glorifi- 
cation of feminine passion. The most interesting 
of her characters are her heroines. She says she 
has " dreamed them in accordance with the ideal of 
an ancient poet, feminine body, heart of man, 
and head of angel." The reader may be inclined to 
regard them as romantic titans with a super- 
abundance of feminine body. 

Marianne, in " Before Love," demands " her 
place in the sun, and her right to love," by which 
she understands little more than the elemental 
privilege given by nature. Jacqueline Vallier in 
" The Ransom " is a frivolous young woman 
aroused by illicit love to a sense of her responsi- 
bilities as wife and mother. The reader is a bit 
startled to see adultery seriously proposed as a 
school of ethics, and, contrasting the work with 
" The Princesse de Cleves," in which the character 
of the heroine develops ^through her victory over 
passion; one is inclined to agree with Miss Repplier 
that our age is marked by a " loss of moral nerve." 
" The Storm Bird " is the author's weakest attempt. 
One critic has observed that it is the counterpart 
of " Madame Bovary," apparently because Mme. 
Tinayre treats her erring provincial heroine with 
all tenderness, while Flaubert applies the sternest 
logic to Emma Bovary. " Helle " is the story of 
the niece of a distinguished Hellenist who has edu- 
cated her according to principles of his own. His 
aim was to give to her, a woman, what the Renais- 
sance had brought to the men of the sixteenth cen- 
tury, liberation of the spirit from the chains of 
convention, social and religious. She is deeply 
read in the masterpieces of antiquity, and is thus 
led to an ideal of complete and harmonious devel- 
opment of character. She has been trained to be 
the peer and comrade of her husband, who is to be, 
as her uncle puts it, one who has known how to 
create in himself a demi-god. Introduced to Pari- 
sian society, she scandalizes the dear old ladies of 
another generation by revolting against the idea of

the " Bulletin " of the University of Texas.

effacing her personality in love. She is at last 
united to a high-minded though rather pedantic 
social reformer, whose work she shares. Very 
much a woman and perhaps the most attractive of 
the author's heroines, she is yet more a rebel than 
any of them, as her battle is for intellectual 
equality. 

Mme. Tinayre's masterpiece, " The House of the 
Sin," is not a thesis novel, though some critics 
would make it a diatribe against Christianity. It 
relates the struggle betAveen human passion and a 
fanatical Jansenism ; but the action rises naturally 
from the characters, and both sides receive fair 
treatment. Nowhere has the author succeeded in 
giving such a variety of uniformly convincing and 
well-drawn portraits. " The Amours of Francois 
Barbazanges " is a charming idyll which presents 
amid pathetic and comic incidents two clashing 
images of love, that of the so-called idealists 
(the scene is laid in the seventeenth century), and 
that of the realists " The Rebel " is the maturest 
work of the author in the literature of revolt. 
Josanne Valentin is an older sister of Marianne, 
and a relative at least of Helle; she pleads her 
cause more passionately than either. She demands 
equality with man, and freedom in both emotional 
and intellectual spheres ; but in the working out of 
the story the emphasis is on liberty in passion. A 
question similar to that of " Tess of the D'Urber- 
villes " is posed, but the conclusion is very different 
from Mr. Hardy's : " Victory remained with love 
which had not despaired, with love strong as life." 
The best of the novel is the description of humble 
quarters of Paris, with their picturesque denizens, 
and of Josanne's work as reporter for " Le Monde 
Feminin," where the author seems to be drawing 
on her own experience as a journalist. The fault 
of the book is its over-stress on the thesis; one 
feels that the characters, however living, are forced 
into subordination to it. The social order combat- 
ted by Mme. Tinayre as the universal one, is 
reversed in her novels: woman holds the strings 
and man dances to her music. Slave of his slave 
becomes his doom, and the reader cannot escape 
the impression of a decidedly abnormal state of 
society. 

The author's latest books seem to be drawing 
away from " problem " studies. "Mourning Love " 
is a collection of short stories relating the suffering 
imposed by passion in different situations. Love is 
represented as an' all-conquering force for whose 
loss there is no consolation but death. " The 
Shadow of Love " takes us to the author's native 
province, Limousin, and charming descriptions of 
this out-of-the-way region serve to lighten a dis- 
agreeable story. Mme. Tinayre is at her best in 
portraying picturesque characters and landscape; 
here Limousin gives her ample opportunity. The 
background of " The Sweetness of Living " is 
Naples; the subject is the effect of the voluptuous 
Italian sky on visitors from the north. The last 
book, " Madeleine at the Mirror," is not a novel, 
but the reveries of a young widow. It is written in 
a rich poetic style, and, best of all, portrays a 
woman's character so simply that we almost forget 
its complexity. Madeleine, not being a heroine of 



fiction, is permitted her share of sound judgment 
and some sense of humor. 

It is interesting to note that many of the author's 
ideas will seem less revolutionary in America than 
in France of to-day. We are rapidly consenting to 
the re-division of social privilege, and are giving 
woman an equal part with man ; she receives prac- 
tically the same education, and can thus enter life's 
struggle on equal terms with him. Marriage is 
more or less a partnership, in which both parties 
retain to a large extent their right of individual 
development, and in which sacrifices are divided. 
Other claims on which Mme. Tinayre insists more 
may be less acceptable. She regards passion as an 
universal and irresistible force, perhaps stronger 
in woman than in man. She comes perilously near 
demanding the application in favor of her sex of 
the " wild oats theory." Herein lies a curious con- 
tradiction in her thought. Her heroines are con- 
stantly enslaved by the very passion they demand 
freedom to gratify. It is written of the rebel her- 
self : " She is no longer Josanne Valentin, she is 
woman before man," and she returns to elemental 
instincts in the embrace of her lover. If it is all to 
end thus, why so much ado? 

Mme. Tinayre's work shows some striking points 
of resemblance to that of George Sand. In both 
are found the passionate rebel, the socialist and the 
lover of picturesque landscape with its humble toil- 
ers. It may be hoped that this new titan, like her 
predecessor, will abandon theses, choosing defi- 
nitely to present new corners of Limousin and 
above all to portray character without bias. In her 
thesis novels, to put it brutally, there is too much 
that recalls Rabelais's " Et tout pour les tripes ! "

BUSKIN AND WAE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Those who hold to the belief, urged in your pages 
recently by Mr. Charles Leonard Moore, that war 
and cultural progress are somehow inseparable are 
often fond of citing Ruskin as a conspicuous cham- 
pion of their theory. And it is true that Ruskin 
did believe that in the past war had been " the 
foundation of all the high virtues and faculties of 
men." But of modern war, of war as it is being 
waged to-day, let us hear what he has to say. (The 
passage is to be found in the lecture on War re- 
printed in " The Crown of Wild Olive.") 

" If you have to take away masses of men from 
all industrial employment, to feed them by the 
labour of others, to move them and provide them 
with destructive machines, varied daily in national 
rivalship of inventive cost; if you have to ravage 
the country which you attack, to destroy for a 
score of future years, its roads, its woods, its cities, 
and its harbours; and if, finally, having brought 
masses of men, counted by hundreds of thousands, 
face to face, you tear those masses to pieces with 
jagged shot, and leave the fragments of living crea- 
tures, countlessly beyond all help of surgery, to 
starve and parch, through days of torture, down 
into clots of clay what book of accounts shall 
record the cost of your work; what book of judg-

ment sentence the guilt of it? That, I say, is mod- 
ern war, scientific war, chemical and mechanic 
war, worse even than the savage's poisoned arrow." 
When one considers the hellish perfection to 
which " chemical and mechanic " war has been 
brought since Ruskin's time, one cannot but feel 
that even that supreme master of language would 
have been at a loss for words forcible and fiery 
enough to express his abhorrence of the " insensate 
devilry " of modern war. I, for one, cannot but 
believe that he would have preferred to see all the 
great cultural treasures of the past perish like the 
manuscripts of Louvain or the painted glass of 
Rheims rather than that Europe should be devas- 
tated and tortured and impoverished and brutalized 
as is being done to-day. RALPH BBONSON .

WHEN IS A NOVEL NOT A NOVEL? 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Having been occupied with the reviewing of 
novels for some thirty years past, I may claim a 
certain acquaintance with the subject-matter of the 
above query. A circulating library called the 
" New Fiction Library," having branches in many 
cities, publicly advertises its readiness to supply its 
customers in the following language: "Any book 
of new fiction not in stock will be secured on the 
following day." For several weeks now I have 
been asking to be supplied with Nexo's " Pelle the 
Conqueror," and have been refused. At last comes 
a letter from the New York headquarters of the 
concern, stating as the reason for refusal that 
" Pelle " is not a work of fiction. This assertion is 
not only a ridiculous falsehood, but it comes with 
comical effect from a concern which supplies its 
customers with " Jean-Christophe " and " The Re- 
volt of the Angels." A second reason adduced (as 
in the old story of the stolen kettle), is that 
" Pelle " is in two volumes, " which in itself would 
bar it from being placed in our library." But how 
about " Jean-Christophe," in three volumes ? Last 
of all, the real reason for the refusal is given: 
" Pelle is not a popular book of fiction, and would 
only be read once or twice." But this does not seem 
to be in accordance with the advertised promise, as 
above quoted. -^ ^ p

DID MILTON NOD? 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In the tenth book of " Paradise Lost " there occurs 
a textual difficulty to which I have never seen atten- 
tion called. It is in the account of Satan's second 
interview with Sin and Death, and has to do with 
the cosmic locality in which the poet would have his 
reader picture the parties. At the moment of the 
meeting Satan is represented as " now returned to 
hell," 1. 346; and as being "near the foot" of 
the upright structure just completed by Sin and 
Death, 1. 348. His location, therefore, as at or 
near Hell-gate, seems doubly indicated : (1) he has 
returned from Earth to his own abode; and (2) 
he is at the foot of a structure which rises from 



Hell to a point hard by the gate of Heaven. But 
in spite of this, some lines further on, as Satan is 
closing his speech, he is evidently not at the bottom, 
but at the top of the new viaduct. On it he pro- 
poses to descend to Hell, 1. 394; on it he does 
descend to Hell-gate, 1. 414; furthermore to reach 
the terrestrial paradise Sin and Death must de- 
scend, 1. 398 ; all three of them are " near Heav- 
en's door " 1. 389. Has the poet in closing the 
scene forgotten where he began it? That seems 
incredible. Have we then just here evidence of 
inadvertence on the part of some amanuensis'? 
This also seems incredible, for there is no one word 
or phrase failure to catch which would account for 
the inconsistency. 

This passage (330ff.) is of the greater impor- 
tance because of its bearing upon the problem of 
the correct location of the head of " the new won- 
drous pontifice." Dr. Stopford A. Brooke, in his 
" Milton Primer," p. 87, makes the structure ter- 
minate at " the base " of the newly created cosmos, 
while Professor Masson and Dr. Orchard carry it 
higher, even to the summit, hard by the foot of the 
Golden Heaven-stair. The parallelism in function 
between the celestial stair and the infernal bridge 
favors Dr. Brooke's interpretation, but the passage 
before us is clearly against it. If any reader of 
THE DIAL will harmonize the data of this problem, 
he will surely place many students under obliga- 
tion. Even a conjecture should be of value.

IMPEEIAL JAPANESE POETRY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
The late Emperor, Meiji Tenno, as he is posthu- 
mously known, and the late Empress, were both 
proficient and prolific in the production of the 
famous Japanese short poem. The present Em- 
peror and Empress seem to be following in the 
footsteps of their predecessors. The following 
translations of some of their recent poems will 
indicate how their minds are occupied at the pres- 
ent time. The first three are by the Emperor; the 
remaining two by the Empress. 

" If life, for country's sake men give, 
How shall dependent loved ones live?" 

" The fortress hard to take ! 
Alas! the children, wives, 
Set mourning for the sake 
Of those who gave their lives! " 

" As monuments sublime war trophies stand. 
Their cost? The lives of men throughout the land." 

" See! Skilled of hand and brave of heart, 
Kind women into service press, 
From homes and little ones apart, 
The soldiers' ills to heal and bless." 

" The widowed ones, how shall they spend their years? 

Their keepsakes, soldiers' letters, stained with tears! " 

I might add that the work of translation and 
versification has been done by Mr. D. Miyake, of 
the Japanese Navy, and Professor Philip Henry 
Dodge. ERNEST W. CLEMENT.

ONE WHOM THE GODS TJOVEI>.* 



Not having a heart " dry as summer dust," 
Edward Rowland Sill was not one of those 
who are suffered to ' ' burn to the socket, ' ' but 
rather did he belong among those favorites of 
heaven to whom an early death is benign an tly 
granted. Five and forty years was his allotted 
span, and it sufficed him for such rare and 
exquisite self-expression in word and deed, in 
prose and verse and daily conduct, as will long 
be an inspiration to those qualified to appre- 
ciate what his too-short life and his too-modest 
contribution to literature stood for. Of these 
discerning few is his present biographer, Mr. 
William Belmont Parker, who is also the editor 
of his collected poems, and who, as he tells us, 
more than ten years ago, in a burst of enthu- 
siasm and admiration, entered upon this more 
important task now so happily completed. 
When half-way through his work as originally 
planned, the author came under the influence 
of that master-biographer, Leslie Stephen, and 
turned back to make his book as far as possible 
an autobiography of Sill, drawing largely 
upon the latter 's correspondence and other 
writings for the purpose. For it was a dictum 
of Stephen's that "nobody ever wrote a dull 
autobiography," and that though "the biog- 
rapher can never quite equal the autobiog- 
rapher," yet "with a sufficient supply of 
letters he may approach very closely to the 
same results." Thus, while no one can tell 
how good Mr. Parker's work as first con- 
ceived would have been, it is certain that the 
actual production, with its copious extracts 
from Sill's unpublished manuscripts, epis- 
tolary and other, gives a clear and vivid im- 
pression of what manner of human being here 
confronts us. 

"Like most American men of letters," 
the opening chapter begins, "the author of 
'Opportunity' and 'The Fool's Prayer' was a 
native of New England. ' ' Windsor, Connect- 
icut, was his birthplace; April 29, 1841, the 
date of his birth. He was a descendant of 
Presbyterian and Congregational ministers on 
his mother's side, of physicians and surgeons 
on his father's, and his ancestral tree is rich 
in Walcotts, Grants, Edwardses, Ellsworths, 
Rowlands, Allyns, and representatives of 
other good old New England families. Early 
left an orphan, Sill had no very permanent 
place of abode in all his life. An uncle 's house 
at Cuyahoga Falls in Ohio was always open to 
him. and it was there and at another uncle's

Belmont Parker. Illustrated. Boston : Houj?hton Mifflin Co. 



in Pennsylvania, and finally at Exeter, that he 
spent the years devoted to preparation for 
Yale, whence he was graduated at twenty. 
A voyage to California then followed, and half 
a dozen years of changing occupations in that 
new land, after which came marriage, a brief 
taste of theological study at the Harvard 
Divinity School, six weeks of journalism in 
New York, two years of high-school principal- 
ship and superintendency of schools at Cuya- 
hoga Falls, twelve of teaching in California, 
including nine years in the chair of English 
at the State University, and, finally, from 
1883 until his death in 1887, literary pursuits 
at Cuyahoga Falls with no daily grind of reci- 
tations and lectures. But from his college 
days to the end Sill was addicted to writing, 
with brilliant success in competition for aca- 
demic honors, biat apparently never with any 
consuming desire to see himself in print. On 
this point he said of himself in later life, in 
writing to an editor and friend : 

" I don't think other people feel the way I do 
about that. When a thing is written, they have a 
trembling hope, at least, that it is good, and any- 
how wish to have it used. But you should see the 
equanimity with which I write thing after thing 
both prose and verse and stow them away, never 
sending them anywhere, or thinking of printing any 
book of them, at present, if ever. Sometimes I do 
think I will leave a lot of stuff for some one to pick 
out a post-humorous volume from but more and 
more my sober judgment tells me that other people 
have seen or will see all that I have, and will state 
it better." 

This lack of eagerness for public fame both 
contributes to the charm he exerts over us and 
helps to account for the veil of anonymity he 
chose to throw over much of his best literary 
work. It was in the unpretentious ' ' Contribu- 
tors ' Club" of the magazine edited by his 
friend Aldrich that he most frequently ap- 
peared in his choice bits of unsigned prose, 
and it was in the same monthly periodical that 
he first came somewhat conspicuously into 
public view as a poet. Even as a poet of whose 
merit Aldrich delighted to regard himself as 
the discoverer, Sill would fain have remained 
unknown by name. He writes to the editor: 
" I like the anonymousness of the Contribu- 
tors' Club. Would you not as soon print 
poems for me unsigned ? ' ' Occasionally he was 
permitted to use a pen-name, partly to avoid 
any seeming excess of his verse in the maga- 
zine. On the subject of pseudonymity occurs 
this characteristic utterance in one of his let- 
ters to Aldrich : 

" It may be said but a man would be in danger 
of printing (or offering for print) things that he 
would have made better if his own name were to go 
with them. No, I think not. If he had a perma-

nent mask he would be more sensitive about this 
even than his own proper face, and would do his 
best for it." 

Significant of his modesty and of his un- 
willingness to bear the responsibility of any- 
thing short of the best possible in his art, is 
the fact that only one slight volume, "The 
Hermitage, and Other Poems," was given by 
him to the public ; what else we have from his 
pen in book form is of the posthumous sort 
which he wittily but not quite accurately chose 
to regard as "post-humorous." This anxious 
concern about the products of his pen appears 
again and again in his correspondence so 
often as possibly to arouse a suspicion of mock 
modesty, unjust though such a suspicion must 
be held by his admirers and it is found in 
an amusing form in a letter to Aldrich that is 
worth quoting, in part, at this point, largely 
because it shows how far the writer had 
strayed from the rigid orthodoxy of his Pres- 
byterian ancestors. He writes, under date of 
June 9, 1885 : 

" Do you want to do me a great favor? I don't 
know in the least what your proclivities (or declivi- 
ties) are in the way of religious matters, but I am 
going to assume that yours are not far away from 
mine enough to ask you, if you are naturally in 
the way of seeing manuscripts, submitted to the 
firm for publication, to look into an essay I sent 
them (with some others) entitled ' The XlXth Cen- 
tury ' along toward the end of it and purloin 
certain pages treating of the Christian Church as a 
nuisance and a fraud if it is likely, otherwise, to 
be read by some members of the firm (I don't in 
the least know who or what they are) some very 
conservative, elderly, religious, sensitive, choleric, 
old-fashioned gentleman with gold-spectacles and 
high collar, and a pew in church and gold-headed 
cane who hates George Sand and Herbert Spen- 
cer (by reputation) and loves Joseph Cook. Is 
there such a fearful catastrophe imminent as that 
such a man should read my essay and be made 
really ill by it?" 

Almost twenty years earlier the conviction 
had begun to force itself upon Sill that he 
could never be other than a non-conformist, 
that he must live his own life and think his 
own thoughts in entire independence. Hence, 
in part at least, the severing of his connection 
with the University of California, where in his 
day a free-thinker was not exactly a persona 
grata. Hence also, still earlier, his departure 
from Cambridge and his farewell to the study 
of theology. "There could be no pulpit for 
me after going through there," he says, "ex- 
cept as an independent, self -supported minis- 
ter, which of course is open to any one with a 
purse. I came reluctantly to that conclusion. 
Another person, even with my opinions in 
theology, might have judged differently. It 
is no sentimentalism with me it is simply a 



solemn conviction that a man must speak the 
truth as fast and as far as he knows it truth 
to him. I may be in error but what I 
believe is my sacred truth, and must not be 
diluted. When I get money enough to live on 
I mean to preach religion as I believe in it. 
Emerson could not preach, and now I under- 
stand why." Hence, once more, his inability, 
as a mere youth, to conduct himself as a model 
student at the hide-bound Yale College of his 
day ; and in the light of his subsequent devel- 
opment one is not surprised to find him chafing 
under meaningless restraint, breaking arbi- 
trary rules, and rusticated at the end of 
Freshman year for neglect of college exercises, 
which included perfunctory and undevotional 
chapel attendance sixteen times a week. 

Of Sill's variety and brilliancy of endow- 
ment we get a hint from the testimonies of 
classmates printed in the biography. Gov- 
ernor Baldwin, of Connecticut, finds written 
in his diary of those student days: "We 
haven't got much of a class, but Sill is some- 
what of a genius, to be sure." Before his first 
year of college was half completed this was 
the general verdict concerning him. Another 
classmate recalls that "despite his slight fig- 
ure, he had a beautiful rich bass voice; and 
he had, of course, as lyric poets must have, a 
genius for music. He could play on any in- 
strument he took a notion to, with very little 
practice. Yet I don't remember that he sang 
in the choir. Perhaps he would have been apt 
to refrain in those rebellious years, because of 
distaste for the service." It appears that at 
one time he thought seriously of training him- 
self to become an organist. That was in the 
first California period, when also he came 
within a little of adopting the stage as his 
profession, and when too he made trial of the 
law (or gave some thought thereto), of ranch- 
ing, of bank-clerking, of post-office work, for a 
season coquetted with the notion of studying 
medicine, and doubtless turned his eager and 
active mind in many other more or less prom- 
ising directions besides. As an actor or as a 
musician there is reason to believe he might 
have won distinction ; as an expounder of the 
' ' nice sharp quillets of the law ' ' he would have 
been a ludicrous misfit; and as a healer of 
the sick he would, despite his gentleness, his 
sympathy, and his tenderness, have rebelled 
against the monotony and the drudgery of the 
calling. 

As already intimated, the author has done 
well to let Sill tell most of his own story, and 
to withhold, so far as the present work is con- 
cerned, such excursions in "essay and criti- 
cism" as had been included in his first plan. 
The real Edward Rowland Sill was what his

lovers were waiting for, and this is what Mr. 
Parker's book, written with the sanction and 
help of Sill's relatives and friends, and well 
provided with portraits and other illustra- 
tions, now faithfully presents.

CLASSICS ox THE ART OF PLAY-MAKING.* 



When the new Hall of Philosophy at 
Columbia University was opened in 1911, two 
rooms were allotted to Professor Brander 
Matthews in which to house the dramatic 
museum it had long been his ambition to 
establish. The larger of these rooms now con- 
tains a dramatic library of several thousand 
volumes; a considerable proportion of which 
are the gift of Professor Matthews himself, 
while the smaller has been set apart for the 
exhibition of an historical series of models, 
illustrating the successive stages in the devel- 
opment of the drama from the days of the 
Greeks to the present time. Many of these 
models have already been installed; a few, 
such as the Palladian Theatre at Vicenza and 
the theatre built by Richelieu in the Palais- 
Cardinal, await a patron's bounty, all the 
models displayed being the gifts of individ- 
uals. Although still incomplete, this excep- 
tional museum contains in miniature the 
Athenian Theatre of Dionysus, a platform of 
a French mystery play, a pageant-wagon of 
an English mystery, a platform in a Tudor 
inn yard, a stage-set of the Italian comedy of 
Masks, a multiple-set at the Hotel de Bour- 
gogne and the Fortune Theatre, a fairly com- 
plete historical series with which to make 
plain to the student the development of the 
drama from the days of the Greeks to the time 
when Moliere, inspired by Italian mask com- 
edy, created the modern drama. 

No true student of the stage will gainsay 
the practicality of this museum. Indeed, as 
Professor Matthews says in his prefatory note 
to its catalogue': 

" In so far as the drama is within the limits of 
literature it can be studied in a library; but in so 
far as it is outside the limits of literature, it needs 
for its proper understanding a gallery and a 
museum, containing the graphic material which will 
help the student to reconstruct for himself the 
conditions under which the masterpieces of the 
great dramatists were originally performed the

conditions in conformity with which they were 
composed." 

With this pronouncement all those who really 
know the stage and its functions will agree; 
for although we may read dramatic master- 
pieces while sitting in a comfortable library 
chair, we should not forget that they were 
written to be seen, on the stage. In other 
words, unless we can visualize the size and 
arrangement of the theatres in which they 
were played, as well as the character of the 
audiences to which they made appeal, we can- 
not rightly estimate the work of such masters 
as Sophocles, Shakespeare, Moliere, and Gol- 
doni. As an aid to this necessary visualiza- 
tion, Professor Matthews 's museum stands 
unique. The Comedie Franchise possesses 
certain models illustrating plays it has pro- 
duced; while at the Clara-Ziegler Haus in 
Munich, there is a museum showing the his- 
tory of the German stage; yet neither of 
these chauvinistic collections, nor the Museo 
Teatrale in the Scala Theatre at Milan, shows 
the successive stages in the development of 
the drama throughout the world. 

To perform this latter function is the aim 
of the Dramatic Museum of Columbia Uni- 
versity, an institution which should right- 
fully have been called the Brander Matthews 
Museum, so entirely is it the creation of its 
founder. The Professor of Dramatic Litera- 
ture at Columbia has not been content, how- 
ever, to confine his efforts to those of the 
librarian or curator; the same reverence for 
professional stage-craft which led to the estab- 
lishment of his museum as a laboratory for 
his students having inspired the publication 
of several series of papers to be known as the 
Publications of the Dramatic Museum of 
Columbia University. The first of these, re- 
cently published by subscription in an edition 
of three hundred and thirty-three copies, con- 
sists of four neat little volumes on the art of 
play-making, comprising respectively: "The 
New Art of Making Plays," by Lope de Vega, 
translated by Professor William Tenney 
Brewster, with an introduction and notes by 
Professor Brander Matthews; "The Auto- 
biography of a Play," by Bronson Howard, 
with an introduction by Mr. Augustus 
Thomas; "The Law of the Theatre," by M. 
Ferdinand Brunetiere, translated by Mr. 
Philip M. Hayden, with an introduction by 
Mr. Henry Arthur Jones ; and ' ' Robert Louis 
Stevenson as a Dramatist," by Sir Arthur 
Wing Pinero, with an introduction and a 
bibliographical appendix by Mr. Clayton 
Hamilton. Although his name appears here 
solely as author of the introduction to one of 
these booklets. Professor Matthews is as en-

THE DIAL 



[ March 4 



tirely the originator and editor of these pub- 
lications as he is the founder and curator of 
a dramatic museum in the catalogue of which 
he is not recorded as functioning in any 
capacity whatsoever, a self-effacement nota- 
ble in an age when the rays of the lime-light 
are sought even by college professors. 

Turning from this exceptional modesty to 
the four enlightening volumes Professor Mat- 
thews has edited, it may be said forthwith 
that here is both solid shot and canister with 
which to rout the ardent enthusiasts whose 
self-imposed task is to "uplift" the drama. 
Indeed, with the exception of M. Brunetiere, 
the authors of these papers on play-making 
may be classed as commercial dramatists, who 
believe that the function of the theatre is to 
please and not to preach. As Mr. Henry 
Arthur Jones writes the introduction to this 
single exception to Professor Matthews 's rule 
that papers on play-making should be written 
by makers of plays, the voice of the practical 
man may be said to be raised even here. 
Moreover, Mr. Jones's scintillant introduction 
quite eclipses in interest M. Brunetiere 's 
didactic holding of his pet thesis that a play 
"is the spectacle of a will striving toward a 
goal, and conscious of the means which it 
employs." In contravention of this theory, 
Mr. William Archer has insisted that a play is 
a crisis not a conflict. But Mr. Jones frames 
a law of his own. "Drama arises," he says, 
"when any person or persons in a play are 
consciously or unconsciously 'up against' 
some antagonistic person, or circumstance, or 
fortune." 

Whether a drama be a conflict, a crisis, or 
a case of "up against it," is of minor impor- 
tance, the elusive art of play-making being to 
hold the interest of an audience. To place a 
person or persons in a play "up against" 
something that will get over the footlights is 
the problem that confronts the dramatist, and 
it matters little whether that something be 
defined as a conflict or a crisis, provided it be 
novel enough to excite interest or human 
enough to inspire sympathy. Moreover, the 
test of the box-office is also the test of time, 
since a play that does not appeal to its own age 
sufficiently to gain at least a respectable hear- 
ing will not live long enough for posterity to 
become aware of its existence. 

Knowing his contempt for the closet-drama, 
one suspects Professor Matthews of having 
published these instructive papers on play- 
making in order to confound the "high- 
brows," for the voice of the successful dra- 
matist inevitably conjures up the spectre of 
'Commercialism. Listen to Lope de Vega, as 
.commercial a dramatist as ever wrote : 



" True it is that I have sometimes written in 
accordance with the art which few know; but, no 
sooner do I see coming from some other source the 
monstrosities full of painted scenes where the 
crowd congregates and the women who canonize 
this sad business, than I return to that same bar- 
barous habit, and when I have to write a comedy 
I lock in the precepts with six keys, I banish Ter- 
ence and Plautus from my study that they may 
not cry out at me; for truth, even in dumb books, 
is wont to call aloud; and I write in accordance 
with that art which they devised who aspired to the 
applause of the crowd; for since the crowd pays 
for the comedies, it is fitting to talk foolishly to it 
to satisfy its taste." 

The authorship of some two thousand or more 
plays is attributed to this same Lope de Vega. 
yet his name spells Spanish drama. As Pro- 
fessor Matthews says, in his introduction to 
Lope 's ' ' New Art of Writing Plays, " "it was 
he who made the pattern that Calderon and 
all the rest were to employ. ' ' Here is the pat- 
tern drawn by this master craftsman : 

" Do not spend sententious thoughts and witty 
sayings on family trifles, . . . But when the char- 
acter who is introduced persuades, counsels, or dis- 
suades, then there should be gravity or wit . . . 
If the king should speak, imitate as much as possi- 
ble the gravity of a king; if the sage speak, 
observe a sententious modesty ; describe lovers with 
those passions which greatly move whoever listens 
to them . . . Let him [the playwright] be on his 
guard against impossible things, for it is of the 
chiefest importance that only the likeness of truth 
should be represented . . . 

" In the first act set forth the case. In the sec- 
ond weave together the events, in such wise that 
until the middle of the third act one may hardly 
guess the outcome. Always trick expectancy; and 
hence it may come to pass that something quite far 
from what is promised may be left to the under- 
standing." 

To study further the laws of dramatic con- 
struction, except in practice, is largely futile ; 
since, in the words of the late Bronson How- 
ard, "when all the mysteries of humanity 
have been solved, the laws of dramatic con- 
struction can be codified and clearly ex- 
plained; not until then." Yet this lamented 
American has himself framed a vital law of 
construction in his edifying "Autobiography 
of a Play." "A dramatist," he holds, 
"should deal so far as possible with subjects 
of universal interest, instead of with such as 
appeal strongly to a part of the public." 
Realizing, as have all successful dramatists, 
that a stage appeal must not be made to 
"hearts here and there," but to "a thousand 
hearts at once, ' ' he reaches the logical conclu- 
sion that ' ' love of the sexes is most interesting 
to that aggregation of human hearts we call 
the audience."

THE DIAL,

To Lope de Vega's epitome of the art of 
play-making and Bronson Howard's sane rule 
of selection should be added Sir Arthur Wing 
Pinero's definition of strategy as "the general 
laying out of a play," and tactics as "the art 
of getting the characters on and off the stage, 
of conveying information to the audience and 
so forth." To complete this vade-mecum for 
the playwright, it is necessary to turn to La 
Critique de I'ficole des Femmes, a dramatic 
polemic written by Moliere to confound the 
"high-brows" of his day. In scorn of their 
"rules made only to embarrass the ignorant 
and deafen the rest of us," Moliere thus 
frames the one universal law, not only of the 
drama, but of every art : 

" I should like to know whether the great rule 
of all rules is not to please, and if a play which has 
attained that end has not travelled a good road? 
Can the entire public be mistaken, and is not 
each one capable of judging of the pleasure he 
receives ? " 

The drama is the most democratic as well as 
the most contemporary of the arts ; its appeal 
being made not to people of the future but to 
those of the present, not to one class but to all. 
If a play pleases the public of its own time, 
has it not, as Moliere says, travelled a good 
road ? Moreover, can the entire public be mis- 
taken? This question is answered by Sir 
Arthur Wing Pinero in his paper on ' ' Robert 
Louis Stevenson as a Dramatist." "The in- 
stinct," he says, "by which the public feels 
that one form of drama, and not another, is 
what best satisfies its intellectual and spiritual 
needs, at this period or that, is a natural and 
justified instinct. ' ' 

A dramatist may rise to a moral plane as 
high as the ideals of his public, or debase his 
talents to the limit of police toleration; but 
he cannot disregard the instinct of which Sir 
Arthur speaks, without failure as the penalty. 
It should be apparent, therefore, that if in a 
particular age this instinct is either vicious or 
crass, the public, rather than the stage, needs 
"uplifting," a 'task for the accomplishment 
of which a cohesion of all the moral elements 
in the community, rather than the ardor of 
a few zealots, is required. 

Another pertinent lesson in stage-craft is 
taught by Sir Arthur Wing Pinero in his 
analysis of the failure as a dramatist of so 
dramatic a novelist as Robert Louis Stevenson. 
The prizes of the dramatist were to Steven- 
son's thinking "out of all proportion to the 
payment of the man of letters" ; therefore the 
theatre was "a gold mine," upon which to 
keep his commercial eye. However, he failed 
to secure its ingots, because, as Sir Arthur 
says, "he played at being a playwright." 



The art of play-making, which the eminent 
dramatist just quoted so aptly defines as 
"compressing life without falsification," is 
too serious an art to play with. Stevenson 
approached the dramatic gold mine believing 
he had only to scratch the earth in order to 
disclose the ingots. These, alas! lie far be- 
neath the surface. Only by infinite patience 
and skill may they be unearthed. 

To the novelists who share Stevenson's con- 
tempt for the drama, as well as to the enthu- 
siasts engaged in elevating it, the admirable 
booklets Professor Brander Matthews has 
modestly issued in the name of his pet achieve- 
ment are recommended as pertinent reading. 
Papers on the art of acting by Talma, Coque- 
lin, William Gillette, etc., are to be added in 
the autumn to these publications of the Dra- 
matic Museum of Columbia University. That 
they may prove as illuminating as the present 
group on play-making should be the wish of 
all who have the welfare of the drama at heart.

EUROPEAN TRAVEL, IN THE EIGHTEENTH 
CENTURY.* 



If not quite a pioneer in the rich field of 
early European travel, Professor Mead is one 
of the first to work systematically therein. 
Miss Howard's "English Travellers of the 
Renaissance," Mr. Bates 's "Touring in 
1600," and most other detailed studies have 
dealt mainly with the sixteenth and seven- 
teenth centuries. Babeau's "Les Voyageurs 
en France," though covering about three cen- 
turies, is limited to one country. Professor 
Mead has therefore limited himself to the 
eighteenth century, with an occasional glance 
backward and forward, and. in the nature of 
things, to those countries (France, Italy, Ger- 
many, and the Low Countries) which were 
generally included in the conventional grand 
tour. 

Foreign travel for the avowed purpose of 
education of becoming "the complete gen- 
tleman" may be said to have begun in 
Elizabethan times, and owing to the heavy 
expense involved was limited to the upper 
classes. With occasional interruptions due to 
war, the stream of Continental travel contin- 
ued, and in the eighteenth century travelling 
became, relatively, so easy that large numbers 
of young Englishmen were constantly to be 
found in the great centres of the countries 
chiefly visited. So numerous, indeed, did they 
become that it was not easy for a Briton to

flin Co.

get away from his countrymen for the pur- 
pose of acquiring the language. This, however, 
did not seriously trouble many Englishmen, 
who cared little about learning foreign lan- 
guages. The indifference of Englishmen to 
the Continental vernaculars has always been 
marked. 

It was of course a far different Europe that 
the eighteenth century tourist saw from that 
of to-day. It was the Europe of pre-Revolu- 
tionary days, before the social order had been 
transformed. France had not yet got away 
from the fatal centralizing policy of Louis 
XIV. Spain was "in full decadence." Italy 
was at the lowest ebb of her decline ; ' ' no man 
could take pride in the name of Italian." 
Germany was slowly recovering from the 
Thirty Years' "War, and was "inert and un- 
progressive, feudal in spirit and practice, and 
everywhere divided against itself. ' ' The Low 
Countries alone were on the whole free and 
prosperous; except Belgium, whose commer- 
cial expansion was blocked by Holland and 
England. 

The impression left by Professor Mead's 
chapters on Water Travel, Roads, Carriages, 
and Inns is that tourists were courageous to 
travel at all. The railways have completely 
revolutionized travel; by making it easy to 
get over the country they have vastly in- 
creased the number of travellers, and thus 
have forced an improvement in accommoda- 
tions and at least a partial change of 
heart on the part of innkeepers, who now real- 
ize how essential it is to make travellers 
comfortable. Before the advent of steam, how- 
ever, travel both by land and by water was 
"no unmixed delight." In 1787 Arthur 
Young spent fourteen hours between Dover 
and Calais. On the Continent travel by 
water was much more common than now. One 
could go from Paris to Lyons by water (ten 
days, thirty-five livres, or about $6.75) ; the 
water journey from Lyons to Avignon alone 
required three days. To avoid the Alps, many 
preferred the Mediterranean trip from Mar- 
seilles or Nice to Genoa, even with its possi- 
bility of sea-sickness and its danger of capture 
by the dreaded Barbary pirates. In Ger- 
many the Rhine, the Elbe, and the Danube 
were utilized as far as possible, and in the 
Low Countries water travel was well organ- 
ized. James Edward Smith says that the con- 
venience and pleasure of travel in Holland 
and Flanders "can hardly be conceived from 
description." 

Land travel was scarcely less difficult than 
in former times, and was vastly more tedious 
than now. French roads were better than 
Italian. Naples had practically no roads at 



all except that which led to Rome, and this 
was in winter so bad that "one ran great risk 
of being swallowed up in the mud-holes." 
German roads were notoriously bad ; improve- 
ments did not begin till 1753. In Nugent 's 
time (about 1756) post wagons made about 
eighteen miles a day. 'In Hanover, as late as 
1826, John Russell reports, scarcely outside 
the gates the wheels of the coach sank up to 
the axle-tree. 

Unless one could afford one's own vehicle, 
one travelled in the diligence a vehicle 
which grew in massiveness until those used by 
Fenimore Cooper were " as large as an ordi- 
nary load of hay, carried twenty or thirty 
passengers, and weighed five tons." Many 
preferred the post-chaise, which was more 
expensive. From Calais to Paris (thirty- two 
posts) a single post fare in 1756 cost about 
$21.75 ; two could do it for $31.50. Private 
coaches were very expensive. In Italy one 
could travel "with post-horses; with a vet- 
tura or hired coach or calash in which they 
do not change horses; and, finally, with a 
procaccio or stage-coach that undertakes to 
furnish passengers and necessary accommoda- 
tions on the road." The German post wagon 
was much more clumsy and unwieldy than the 
French, and went only about three miles an 
hour. 

The inns left much to be desired, and their 
wretched condition compelled travellers to 
take much more luggage (both linen and pro- 
visions) than is necessary to-day. Beds were 
likely to be damp and dirty ; there were only 
the most primitive sanitary arrangements. In 
Italy and Germany especially the food, except 
in the large towns, was often poor or ill 
cooked; and as Smollett remarks, a common 
prisoner in the Marshalsea or King's-Bench 
was more cleanly and commodiously lodged 
than travellers were in many places between 
Rome and Florence. 

Yet in spite of these drawbacks, the attrac- 
tions of travel proved too strong to be re- 
sisted. In the ' ' Letters Concerning the Present 
State of England" (1772) it is said that 
"where one Englishman travelled in the 
reigns of the first two Georges, ten now go on 
a grand tour." The number who travelled 
chiefly for the purpose of improving their 
minds and gaining} intelligence, however, 
does not seem to have been relatively very 
great. Few were well prepared to reap the 
maximum advantage from foreign travel. 
At the university a man "could not avoid 
picking up the rudiments of Latin and Greek 
and some bits of information about ancient 
Rome and a few other cities, but of the topog- 
raphy, the history, the government, the art,

the architecture, the social conditions of the 
countries he intended to visit, he was . . 
often disgracefully ignorant." Many still 
favored the plan of sending boys abroad in 
care of a tutor ; but the number of competent 
tutors was small indeed. 

Attempting some generalizations, Profes- 
sor Mead thinks that the average English 
tourist was incompetent to form a judgment 
of the people of the Continent. ' ' Perhaps the 
most striking characteristic of the ordinary 
run of English travellers was their insularity 
and their unreadiness to admit the excel- 
lence of anything that was unfamiliar." Yet 
Englishmen who chose to be popular on the 
Continent were often remarkably so. They 
"had a reputation for fair dealing, and for 
keeping their promises." 

Likewise Englishmen were unable to esti- 
mate fairly the art and architecture of the 
Middle Ages. "To many an Englishman 
Italy was interesting chiefly as a vast museum 
of antiquity which enabled him to vivify his 
recollections of the classics." Addison at 
once occurs to those familiar with his travels, 
as of this class. On such men the glories of 
mediaeval Gothic made no impression. 

The change of attitude which took place 
toward mountain scenery in the eighteenth 
century has been often commented upon. St. 
John's view, as late as 1787, is typical of 
many: 

" Far off lay the mountains of Switzerland, 
forming a most awful and tremendous amphithea- 
tre. When first I turned my glass upon them, if I 
may so express myself, and brought their terrors 
closer to my eye, I started with affright ! . . . Per- 
haps on approaching, and having them continually 
in view, they would not appear so dreadful as at 
first; but even yet at so great a distance, I could 
not behold them through a glass without terror." 
Gray was one of the first to admire mountain 
scenery, and there seem not to have been 
many who followed him, at least for a long 
time. The failure to appreciate the Alps, the 
Pyrenees, and -the Apennines was probably 
due to two things: first, men's preoccupa- 
tion with "the proper study of mankind"; 
and secondly, the difficulties experienced in 
traversing these barren and forbidding re- 
gions. As these difficulties gradually dimin- 
ished, Gray's delight in the sublimity of 
mountain scenery found an echo in many 
hearts. William Coxe wrote to his friend 
William Melmoth in August, 1776 : 

" I have now visited the sources of three great 
rivers in Switzerland, and traced their impetuous 
progress through a tract of country, in which 
nature has exhibited the grandest and most august 
of her works. But it is impossible adequately to 
describe these majestic and astonishing scenes ! In 



description they must all appear nearly the same; 
yet, in fact, every river, cataract, rock, mountain, 
precipice, are respectively distinguished by an infi- 
nite diversity of modifications, and by all the possi- 
ble forms of beauty, magnificence, sublimity, or 
horror. But these discriminating variations, though 
too visibly marked to escape even the least observ- 
ing eye, elude representation, and defy the strong- 
est powers of the pen and pencil." 

Yet with all his obtuseness and his inability 
to make the most out of his opportunities, the 
Englishman must have got more out of his 
travels than we generally give him credit for. 
We are accustomed, following Matthew Ar- 
nold and some others, to think of John Bull 
as a singularly obstinate and conservative 
person. Yet we shall have to admit that in 
Britain new ideas have made steady if slow 
progress. The most flexible of British minds 
Shakespeare, Burke, Arnold himself 
have been leaders of many. The success of 
British colonial policy in these latter days 
shows that Burke 's view has at length pre- 
vailed; and we cannot help thinking that 
something of this change of attitude is due to 
the observing British travellers who have 
penetrated to the ends of the earth. And if 
for a few years following the present war the 
English and the Germans could frankly ex- 
plore each other's country (forgetting all 
about spies), it is safe to say that there would 
never be a repetition of the crime that is now 
being perpetrated on the innocent bystanders 
of Europe. 

Professor Mead has succeeded in producing 
a volume which is both entertaining and of 
high scholarly value. Typographically the 
book leaves nothing to be desired; and the 
eleven illustrations have been well chosen. 
We dislike to have all the notes relegated to 
the back; nothing of importance is gained, 
and hunting for the notes where they are 
wastes too much time. There is an adequate 
bibliographical note (supplementing Pinker- 
ton) , and a good index.

CHARACTER-READING THROUGH THE 
FEATURES.* 



Since Aristotle's day, at least, men have 
diligently searched for a key with which to let 
themselves into the inner life of their fellows ; 
and no subject of study seems to have been so 
fascinating and at the same time so elusive as 
this one. The ancients sought to solve the 
great mystery by comparing the features of 
man with those of animals,' on the principle 
that likeness in features denoted similarity in

intellectual and temperamental traits. They 
assumed, for instance, that a man with a 
leonine brow must have a lion's characteris- 
tics, while a man with a canine brow must 
have the traits of a dog. This mode of ap- 
proach to the secrets of character has been the 
favorite one, though not the only one, all the 
way down to our own day. Mr. Fosbrooke's 
"Character Reading through Analysis of the 
Features" is based in part on this conception, 
and in part on the doctrine that a particular 
formation of features denotes a special sort of 
intellect and type of character. But the au- 
thor does not depend entirely on analysis of 
the features in a strictly anatomical sense. At 
times he bases his "reading" on the expres- 
sion of the features, rather than on their form, 
size, and relation. The frontispiece is a pic- 
ture of a woman, and bears the title, ' ' Con- 
centration." It is evident that the author 
intended the reader to get the idea of concen- 
tration from the expression of the woman's 
face, the lines of strain in the brow and 
about the eye, and from the attitude of her 
body ; and not from the size and shape of her 
nose, ears, or chin, the color of her eyes and 
hair, the construction of her lips, or any other 
anatomical characteristic. 

The sketches for the various types of each 
feature are unusually good. The impression 
which a hasty turning of the leaves makes 
upon one is that there will be some interesting 
secrets revealed in this book, and that stu- 
dents of human nature will get suggestions 
from it which they can utilize in classifying 
people. But the critical reader will be disap- 
pointed when he comes upon Plate I., for this 
is a reproduction of the conventional phreno- 
logical chart in which all the varied faculties 
of the soul are localized in the left hemisphere 
of the brain. What the right hemisphere is 
used for is a mystery about as profound as 
the other mysteries discussed in the book. 
A dozen or so of the faculties, such as "lan- 
guage," "form," "size," "weight," "color," 
"order," and "calculation," are located over 
the left frontal sinus and below the left eye. 
The author says that the "bump" theory in 
character-reading was exploded years ago; 
and yet he endorses this phrenological chart, 
and relies upon it in his analysis of concrete 
cases in the latter part of the book. It seems 
extraordinary that in the light of modern 
research on the brain anyone should locate 
"ideality," "sublimity," "hope," " spiritu- 
ality," "veneration," and "conscientious- 
ness" in the upper middle region of the left 
hemisphere. It has been shown literally hun- 
dreds of times that this is the general motor 
region which regulates the movements of the 



dextral half of the body. If one should be 
injured in the left hemisphere where the 
chart localizes ' ' spirituality, ' ' he would be 
paralyzed in the right leg. He probably 
would not have any more or any less spiritu- 
ality than he had before. If one should ex- 
pose this area and stimulate it, the right leg 
of the subject would respond; but there 
would be no spiritual demonstration whatever. 
But the most amazing feature of this phreno- 
logical chart is the location of the language 
faculty underneath the left eye. Modern 
research has shown that the vocal language 
centre is in the middle motor region of the 
left hemisphere. The visual language centre 
is in the occipital lobe. The graphic language 
centre is differentiated out of the general 
right-hand centre in the left hemisphere, and 
the auditory language centre is in the audi- 
tory region of the brain. How anyone in 
these times can continue to befuddle the lay- 
man by pretending to read linguistic ability 
from an examination of the topography of the 
region below the left eye is inconceivable. 

There are many conflicting statements in 
the book, although no more than in any 
book which attempts to delineate character on 
a physiognomical basis. One may read that a 
certain face shows in the forehead "reflective 
and perceptive formation, ability to reason 
from cause to effect, good comparative powers, 
natural knowledge of human nature, construc- 
tive and executive ability, reverence, firmness, 
and a love of approbation, a desire to learn, 
power of judgment as to size and weight, 
mental order well developed resulting in a 
good memory. Eyebrows show indications of 
irritability, the eye shows observation, pene- 
tration, and intellect. Upper eyelids show 
selfishness, self will, and self satisfaction. ' ' 

What little progress psychology has made 
in trying to differentiate the characteristics 
and powers of individuals has led to the view 
that the strongly reflective type of person, one 
who has marked ability in reasoning from 
cause to effect, is likely to be lacking in execu- 
tive ability. Again, the psychologist has been 
able to show that there are as many kinds of 
memory as there are kinds of perceptions and 
ideas, and to say that the forehead shows that 
one has a good memory is indeed humorous. 
Often in this book one reads that the forehead 
shows lack of concentration, while the nose 
shows just the opposite, the lips something 
else, and the chin still something different. 
What kind of a theory of mind can a person 
have who believes that mental characteristics 
are revealed in anatomical traits, when differ- 
ent traits suggest diametrically opposite 
abilities *

If those who are engaged in an attempt to 
develop a science of character-reading would 
take their cue from Darwin, they might in 
time give us something which would be of 
service ; but when they base their ' ' readings ' ' 
upon phrenology and physiognomy, they are 
certain to lead their followers into blind 
alleys. Darwin showed that the fundamental 
emotions are revealed in characteristic muscu- 
lar movements and adaptations of the body as 
a whole, and of the more mobile parts of the 
face, hands, etc. These muscular activities 
were once of service in the struggle for exist- 
ence, and they have persisted even down 
through human life in more or less modified 
and complicated forms. Darwin also showed 
that certain of the very general intellectual 
traits, such as attentiveness and concentra- 
tion, are revealed in specific muscular adapta- 
tions; and the frontispiece in Mr. Fosbrooke's 
volume illustrates this very well. But no man 
has ever shown any connection whatever be- 
tween the expression of the eyes, the lips, etc., 
and particular types of thinking, as in phys- 
ics, chemistry, psychology, philosophy, his- 
tory, etc. And still there are many persons 
who imagine that every intellectual activity is 
revealed in some kind of characteristic tension 
or adaptation of some or all of the features. 

A large proportion of American people 
have apparently not yet grown out of their 
superstitious feeling about the reading of 
character. They still think that someone has 
discovered the connection between every 
"attribute of the soul" and the construction 
and expression of the features. Superstitious 
people of this sort read the analyses of fea- 
tures such as appear in books like the one 
under review, in which a great multitude of 
the most general activities, abilities, and 
attributes are enumerated ; and they will feel 
that they are in the presence of a great revela- 
tion of subtle truth, when they are really only 
being plunged deeper and deeper into confu- 
sion. The author is probably not under as 
great an illusion as his readers will be, for in 
his chapters on "How to Read Faces" and 
"The Knowledge of Physiognomy and Its 
Uses" he does not make a definite statement 
applying his own principles, though he does 
this for the concrete types presented in the 
last chapters of the book. But how can any- 
one test the accuracy of his analyses when 
they concern only imaginary persons designed 
by the artist? 

It may be added that the artist has done 
his work admirably, and that the book is at- 
tractively made on the physical side. 

M. V. O'SHEA. 



A SKETCH OF THE ENGLISH DRAMA.* 



Professor Schelling is so well known as an 
authority on Elizabethan drama that one ap- 
proaches his treatment of that field with 
assurance, knowing that even if it were noth- 
ing more than a condensation of his large 
work on the subject it would be well worth 
while. The chief question concerns his treat- 
ment of the later periods, in which the whole 
subject of English drama is so much less at- 
tractive, and has been so much less put in 
order by scholarship, than in its greatest age. 
Here, also, it may be said at once, there is 
little but praise called forth either by Profes- 
sor Schelling 's judgments in themselves or by 
his frank but urbane manner of pronouncing 
them. In respect to the matter of proportion, 
however, some greater doubt may be felt. Ad- 
mitting the immensely preponderant interest 
of the Elizabethan and Jacobean periods, the 
dreariness of English drama in the neo- 
classical age, and the still tender youth of the 
fresh growth of the form in our own time, yet 
to give substantially two hundred pages out 
of 330 to the matter from Lyly to Davenant, 
and but forty to the entire eighteenth cen- 
tury, with some sixteen for the nineteenth, is 
open to question. The really large product 
of the eighteenth century in serious literary 
drama, while of course of no corresponding 
intrinsic excellence, leads the student to de- 
sire some careful consideration of it, if for no 
other reason than to explain its limitations. 

The great value of the important portion of 
the book, that dealing with what may be called 
Professor Schelling 's own period, is the topi- 
cal analysis of the rich material it affords, 
according to which the several types, such as 
romantic comedy, the "drama of everyday 
life," and the like, are separately accounted 
for with brevity and sureness. This is the 
method of the author's large work, "Eliza- 
bethan Drama," and in that instance it has 
sometimes been found troublesome because of 
the effect in separating rather widely matters 
chronologically akin; but in a book of the 
present compass there can be little question 
of its usefulness. And the writer has not 
permitted himself, even where so great con- 
densation was demanded, to make his chapters 
mere lists and summaries, without distinction 
and individuality of style. On the contrary 
his agreeable personality is almost always 
present. Witness such an obiter dictum as 
this: 

" In our own time the example of Everyman has 
begotten a progeny of contemporary plays, and 
created, even on the popular stage of England and

America, a wholesome diversion from the dismal 
problems and trivial improbabilities that for the 
most part rule there." 

Or this : 

" The pathos of Shylock is totally of 19th cen- 
tury manufacture, and as absurd as it is gratuitous. 
It is referable, like our modern shudder at the 
robust punishment meted out to the Jew, to our 
emasculated contemporary sentimentality that hab- 
itually meddles with clumsy hand to interpose 
between human acts of folly and criminality and 
their logical consequences." 
Another fine passage is on the relation be- 
tween Ford and that modern romanticism 
whose faith is "in the divine guidance of 
passion ' ' ; but there is the less need to quote 
this because it is found in substantially the 
same form in the earlier and larger work. 

Readers familiar with Professor Schelling's 
criticism will be prepared to guard themselves 
unless they be of the same school against 
his disposition to teach that Shakespeare 
could do no wrong. This is evidently not due 
to mere traditionalism, but to a truly devout 
and one must admit an intelligent faith 
in the methods of the great master 's art. Yet 
it sometimes leads to results dubious at best. 
If Professor Schelling, for instance, finds the 
conclusion of "Measure for Measure" ethi- 
cally satisfying (see page 100), he differs not 
only from Coleridge, who called it "a hate- 
ful work," but surely from very many of us. 
In ' ' Othello ' ' he seems to find a certain poetic 
justice of the old-fashioned sort (page 133), 
which again is at least questionable. And 
once more he refuses assent (page 186) to that 
view of Shakespeare's latest plays which 
recognizes a certain falling off in dramatic 
power, though this may now fairly be called 
the orthodox view, and to the present writer 
seems indisputable. 

The bibliographical material in this volume 
is by no means so rich as in the author's sim- 
ilar volume on the Lyric, in the corresponding 
American series; but this is due to no fault 
of his, but to the plan of the general editors. 
Despite this, he has managed to include, in a 
number of valuable footnotes, apparatus sure 
to be very useful to the serious reader. The 
index is of the wholly mechanical and almost 
wholly useless sort ; but this again is obviously 
the fault of the publishers. Nor is the proof- 
reading impeccable, though better than in 
Mr. Rhys's volume in the same series. Par- 
ticularly distressing is the punctuation, 
whether due to unusual theories on the part 
of author or printer one cannot say. 

When all is said of such details as these, 
whereon we critics thrive, this book remains a 
really notable achievement in the packing into 
small compass, by methods at once scholarly 



and humane, of much riches. Few living men 
doubtless no one else in America could 
have done this special task so well. And it 
may be observed that while certain of these 
type-subjects the lyric for instance, are 
rather ill adapted to consecutive historical 
treatment, in the manner of the present series, 
the drama is of just the opposite character. 
It thrives in some sense as an organism, 
rather than in isolated individuals. The 
study of causes, effects, and quasi-biological 
relations, is nowhere more significant. It 
would be well if we could have, one day, a 
new edition of this volume, including a study 
of the recent development of English drama 
made with the same care which has been be- 
stowed on the golden age of its youth.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Lincoln the Believing that ' ' we have had no 
apostle of life written of Abraham Lin- 

democracy. -, ,-, . , , , 

coin worthy of that great man, 
Miss Rose Strunsky courageously essays the 
task of worthily picturing to us the veritable 
Lincoln, the man of the people, "the apostle 
of true democracy," and of placing in a new 
and true historical perspective both the man 
and his time. "While it is beyond dispute that 
Lincoln is so great a man, so noble a figure in 
history, and from manifold points of view so 
attractive a personality, that we can hardly 
have too many faithful and well-written ac- 
counts of his life, it is also not to be denied 
that already more than one able pen has 
traced without serious distortion the features 
of this perennially interesting man and shown 
with some clearness his abiding significance in 
our national history. Although Miss Strun- 
sky declares that "the truth is we have not 
been taught how to tell of his life," many of 
us were of the impression that no ignoble 
attempt to achieve that end was to be found 
in the ten volumes of Nicolay and Hay 's great 
work, as well as in such less elaborate under- 
takings as Miss Tarbell's careful book, Mr. 
William E. Curtis 's account of "The True 
Abraham Lincoln," and, by no means least of 
all, the late Francis Fisher Browne's capti- 
vating volume, "The Every-Day Life of 
Abraham Lincoln." What Miss Strunsky 
would lay emphasis on, however and it is 
an aspect of the subject not to be overlooked 
is the moulding influence of his environ- 
ment and his time in the production of the 
leader demanded at that particular period 
and in those peculiar circumstances. "We 
cannot tell his life by speaking of his life 
alone," she truly says. "We were looking for

our old-time hero of the sagas, and here came 
along one who made the people hero," she 
further tells us, and again: "We speak of 
one who was no more or less than the execu- 
tive and administrator of the will of the peo- 
ple. Whatever were the ideals and desires and 
faults of the common people of his day were 
the ideals and desires and faults of Abraham 
Lincoln." This is paring down his native 
genius and force, his distinct individuality, 
rather unduly, and is making of Lincoln an 
opportunist and a time-server instead of a 
leader and the champion of a cause. The 
writer makes not slavery but "property in 
land" the real cause of the Civil War. Yet 
the southern plantation system would have 
been impossible without slavery, and thus the 
latter must still bear the responsibility com- 
monly ascribed to it. Speaking of what the 
present-day American is striving for, the au- 
thor closes her book with this reading of the 
signs of the times: "Behind the aegis of 
Lincoln he is advancing towards the new order 
of social control small capitalistic and 
closely-knit together." Is it so certain that 
the day of large industrial and financial 
operations is near its sunset? The book, in- 
telligently planned, agreeably written, and 
provided with half a dozen appropriate illus- 
trations, is a welcome though hardly an 
epoch-making addition to the literature of its 
inexhaustibly fertile theme. (Macmillan.) 



Humors of peculiarities of the Scottish 

the Scottish character show themselves no- 
where more unmistakably than 
in the clash of wits that takes place in a Scot- 
tish court of law. Hence the fund of amusing 
anecdote and character-sketch that such a 
book as "Some Old Scots Judges" (Button), 
by Mr. W. Forbes Gray, is likely to contain. 
It is not a work of laborious biographical re- 
search, but rather an entertaining compilation 
from such sources as Cockburn's "Memorials 
of his Time," Ramsay's "Scotland and Scots- 
men," Kay's "Edinburgh Portraits," and 
Knight's "Monboddo and his Contempora- 
ries," with such editorial touches as serve to 
set the several characters in their proper per- 
spective and give a sufficient unity and pro- 
portion to the volume. Here we have, for 
instance, the bluff, unpolished Lord Braxfield 
airing his broad humor and his broader dia- 
lect on the judicial bench. ' ' Hae ye ony coon- 
sel, man?" he asks of Maurice Margorot, 
brought before him on a charge of sedition. 
' ' No, ' ' was the laconic answer. ' ' Dae ye want 
to hae ony appointit?" he continues. "No," 
is the sarcastic rejoinder, "I only want an 
interpreter to make me understand what your 



lordship says." It was the same incorrigible 
Caledonian who said of young Francis Jeffrey, 
fresh from Oxford and beginning his profes- 
sional practice at the Scottish bar, ' ' The laddie 
has clean tint his Scotch and fund nae En- 
glish." To Jeffrey himself, in due time 
raised to the bench, the author devotes one of 
his most readable chapters. It is significant 
to find the man who, as first editor of the 
"Edinburgh Review," misjudged the poetic 
genius of others, equally at fault in estimating 
his own endowment as a writer of imperish- 
able verse. "I feel," he wrote to his sister, 
"I shall never be a great man unless it be as 
a poet. ' ' In addition to the celebrities already 
named, the book has sketches of Lords Kames, 
Monboddo, Gardenstone, Hailes, Eskgrove, 
Balmuto, Newton, Hermand, Eldin, and Cock- 
burn all of the later eighteenth and earlier 
nineteenth centuries. Portraits of all are pro- 
vided, and an unusually full index closes the 
book, which may be confidently commended to 
the lover of biographical anecdote and well- 
considered terse characterization. 



A study 
of musical 
psychology. 



In his clearly written and en- 
tertaining book, "The Musical 
Faculty" (Macmillan Co.). Mr. 
William Wallace endeavors to consider, in its 
abstractness as a part of the musician's inner 
equipment, the conscious activity which pro- 
duces music. The noun in the title indicates 
the point of view from which the book is writ- 
ten. We had supposed that this was a phase 
of speculation somewhat overworn. The iso- 
lating of a section of the consciousness, and 
the elaborate treatment of this abstraction, 
leads generally to rather shadowy results. 
We are inclined to believe that there is no such 
thing as a musical faculty ; but that the whole 
man, his entire development and achievement, 
all that he is and knows, go to the produc- 
tion of his aim, in this case, an expres- 
sion in sound of some profound insight or 
some overmastering experience. Nevertheless, 
this is a book full of interesting if not new 
analyses of various aspects of musical phe- 
nomena. Mr. Wallace maintains that the ear- 
lier composers had no individual development ; 
they showed no growth in their compositions ; 
their later works, like their earlier ones, were 
built upon the same model, and showed the 
same tonal characteristics. With Beethoven 
the break with the old was made; he aban- 
doned his forerunners, and set sail upon the 
unfathomed sea on which the argosies of the 
bold musicians of to-day are navigating, 
bound for ports never dreamed of before. The 
question appears in every art form to-day, and 
yet the orthodox sonata in Beethoven 's hands

was the medium of utterance for ideas not sur- 
passed by any of his successors. Mr. Wallace 
analyzes the intellectual equipment of the 
"wonder child" who seems to know every- 
thing in music when wholly immature in all 
other directions. He concludes that there is 
something occult here which as yet entirely 
exceeds our understanding. He describes the 
nervous apparatus at the basis of music; he 
deals with the mental hearing of music, as in 
the case of a deaf musician ; the extraordinary 
power of inhibition or concentration required 
of the musician; the character of musical 
memory ; and the vast command of multitudi- 
nous resources demanded of the modern leader 
of the orchestra. He discusses at length the 
problem of musical heredity, and has small 
respect for the theories usually advanced on 
the subject. He considers the great musician 
as a representative person at the highest point 
of human development, and combats the no- 
tion that the so-called "genius" invariably 
possesses a diseased consciousness and is al- 
ways an abnormality. The book is provided 
with a useful bibliography, a satisfactory in- 
dex, and contains a great deal of material that 
is valuable. 

A score of great names are 
. selected by Professor Edwin 

"Watts Chubb, in his "Masters 
of English Literature" (McClurg), to repre- 
sent seven of the eight periods into which he 
conveniently divides that literature. Those 
periods are: the Anglo-Saxon or Early En- 
glish, the Middle English, the Elizabethan, 
the Puritan, the Restoration, the Age of 
Classicism, the Age of Romanticism, and the 
Victorian Age. The Anglo-Saxon period he 
leaves unrepresented, for obvious reasons, in 
a popular treatise such as he has prepared; 
to illustrate the others we have Chaucer, 
Shakespeare (whose name Professor Chubb 
prefers to write in almost its briefest possible 
form), Milton, Dryden, Swift, Pope, Johnson, 
Burns, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Wordsworth, 
Scott, Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, Car- 
lyle, Ruskin, Tennyson, and Browning. A 
brief biographical sketch and a generously 
appreciative rather than severely critical 
account of his works are given under each 
writer's name, the whole being preceded by a 
brief Preface and an introductory outline of 
English literature as divided into the fore- 
going periods, and interspersed with frequent 
short quoted passages, while bibliographical 
references at the end of each chapter point 
the student to more extended sources of in- 
formation. George Eliot, the one woman 
writer on the list, has a compliment paid to 
her apophthegmatic quality which is not paid 



even to Johnson or Carlyle; that is, a selec- 
tion of pithy sayings beginning with, 
"Blessed is the man who, having nothing to 
say, refrains from calling attention to the 
fact" is made from her books and ap- 
pended to the section headed by her name. 
In his opening paragraph the scholarly author 
allows himself a little indulgence in what 
seems not exactly like scholarly restraint, the 
scholar's preference for understatement, when 
he says that "one could collect several hun- 
dred definitions of literature or religion." It 
would be a task for most of us to collect a 
dozen of each. What one likes most in this 
attractive book from an ardent lover of "the 
best that has been said and thought in the 
world" is the contagion of enthusiasm for 
that "best" which its pages spread.

penetrable obscurity enveloping the origin and 
early history of the Mexican aborigines is 
acknowledged at the outset by this sixty-years 
student of the subject, and he claims little 
that is new for his opening section on the pre- 
Spanish period of Mexican history. The re- 
maining five sections of the work deal with the 
Spanish conquest, the viceregal or colonial 
period, the war for independence, the period 
of national existence to the downfall of Maxi- 
milian, and the later course of events to the 
abdication of Huerta, with a concluding chap- 
ter on the country's general conditions and 
natural resources. Not wanting in contemp- 
tuous sarcasm is the historian's treatment of 
recent American policy toward Mexico, but he 
formulates no alternative course as a remedy 
for existing ills, though he does say toward 
the close : ' ' Out of the predicament there ap- 
pears for the United States one of two courses : 
open, inglorious retreat, or conquest, protec- 
tion, and dismemberment." The latter mode 
of cure, however, he hardly seems to favor 
when he says, a little earlier : ' ' Three special 
years of infamous treatment they had had at 
the hands of their own countrymen, and now 
the foreign invader is at their door to bring 
them happiness in the form of thirty years 
more of war and bloodshed, for without this 
and more the promised pacification will never 
come to pass." It would have added to the 
book's value as a handy work of reference, and 
would have made its substance easier of mas- 
tery, if dates had been given in the table of 
contents, or in the chapter-headings or page-

headings, or occasionally in the margin 
year dates, we mean, as some avoidable uncer- 
tainty arises from too frequent mention of 
months and days of the month in the text, 
with no year at the top of the page or else- 
where for ready reference. This fault, it 
should be added, is partly corrected by the 
appending of a "chronological table of the 
rulers of Mexico, and dates upon which they 
assumed office." Maps and illustrations 
abound, and in general the work is very ser- 
viceable and also agreeably readable. 



impressions ^ selection of M. Pierre Loti's 
of things out of slighter sketches, of various 
dates, appears in excellent trans- 
lation under the title "On Life's By-ways" 
(Macmillan). The book presents in pleasing 
form the French naval officer's impressions of 
things seen in different parts of the world to 
which ' ' the exigencies of a seafaring life, ' ' as 
he expresses it, have at various times called 
him, together with a brief chapter on Alphonse 
Daudet as man and friend, and another on 
Michelet's book, "The Sea." With exquisite 
art the gifted Frenchman makes one expe- 
rience with him the varied and novel sensa- 
tions evoked by varied and novel sights and 
sounds in divers quarters of the globe in 
Senegal, on Easter Island, in the Basque coun- 
try, in Madrid, and under the shadow of the 
great Sphinx. Of unusual interest to an 
American are the pages written at the Spanish 
capital soon after the outbreak of our war for 
the liberation of Cuba, or, as this sympathizer 
with Spain phrases it, in "the early days of 
the American aggression." The charges of 
perfidy and atrocity there brought against us 
bear an interesting likeness to the charges now 
so vehemently urged against one or another of 
the belligerent nations by the opposite side. 
Warmly espousing the cause of his hospitable 
entertainers, the writer paints a touching pic- 
ture of the sad-eyed Queen Regent in those 
distressing days. Now and then, through the 
impressionism of these vividly descriptive 
chapters, one gets a glimpse of the author's 
philosophy of life, a philosophy not always so 
admirable as the style in which it is clothed. 
After witnessing, with proper loathing, the 
abhorrent spectacle of a Spanish bull-fight, 
the writer thus lightly dispels the shameful 
vision : ' ' Then, remembering that only what 
constitutes physical beauty, the charm and 
delight of the eye, does not prove deceptive, 
I turned my gaze away from the arena and 
looked up at the beautiful senora, dressed in 
light blue, and wearing on her head a white 
mantilla and in her breast a bunch of tea 
roses." A description of the barren dreari- 



ness of Easter Island, taken from a notebook 
of early youth, but subjected to some needed 
revision, is the most remarkably arresting 
piece of writing in the book. It alone would 
justify the volume's existence. The compe- 
tent translator of these well-selected sketches 
is Mr. Fred Rothwell, who also contributes a 
finely appreciative preface. 



Africa's largest island is a thou- 
in Madagascar, sand miles long, three hundred 

and more broad, and contains 
230,000 square miles somewhat larger than 
all the Atlantic States north of the Carolina 
line. ' ' A Naturalist in Madagascar : A Rec- 
ord of Observation, Experiences, and Impres- 
sions Made during a Period of over Fifty 
Years' Intimate Association with the Natives 
and Study of the Animal and Vegetable Life 
of the Island" (Lippincott) contains this in- 
formation, and a great deal more. It is the 
work of the Rev. James Sibree, F.R.G.S., a 
missionary who has written extensively about 
his theatre of operations. The book is in- 
tended rather to be enjoyed than to be studied, 
and is made up of informal accounts of a num- 
ber of journeys made in the island. Precise 
scientific terms are little insisted upon, native 
names are given wherever possible, numerous 
reproduced photographs heighten the interest 
of the text, and result in a substantial octavo 
packed with knowledge imparted cheerfully. 
As the principal haunt of the interesting 
lemurs and of most of the chameleons, with 
a fauna and flora sufficiently distinct from 
that of the mainland to heighten investiga- 
tion, as well as being the home of several sorts 
of humankind, apparently compounded in 
various degrees of Melanesians and Negroes, 
the island is abundantly worth the time and 
space here devoted to it, and is rapidly assum- 
ing importance since its conquest by the 
French nearly twenty years ago. Told as it 
is in an intimate and gossiping manner, the 
volume makes excellent reading, and conveys 
the idea that the author has led a long, happy, 
and interesting life, crowded with strenuous 
duties cheerfully performed.

alarm, that the contagiousness or infectious- 
ness of cancer is far from proved, that danger 
of its accidental acquirement is slight, and 
that care and attention to diet and hygienic 
surroundings are of utmost importance; that 
cancer is local in its beginning, and when 
accessible it may in its beginning be removed 
so perfectly by radical surgical operation that 
the chances are overwhelmingly in favor of its 
non-recurrence. The book is abundantly illus- 
trated, has an extensive bibliography, and 
holds a mine of technical information on the 
theories as to the cause of cancer, the course of 
the various types of the disease, and the 
various methods of treatment and so-called 
"cures." There is also a plea for scientific) 
statistics and a campaign of public education 
to protect sufferers from the dread disease by 
prompt surgical treatment. We note the 
omission of Boveri 's very important contribu- 
tion (possibly too recent for inclusion) to the 
etiology of cancer derived from the study of 
abnormal cell divisions. Dr. Bainbridge's vol- 
ume is a standard reference work, for both the 
practitioner and the patient, concerning all 
the more general relations of this paramount 
medical problem. 



The bible of 
Renaissance 
architects. 



Professor Morris Hickey Mor- 
gan's posthumous translation of 
Vitruvius (Harvard University 
Press) hardly calls for comment on the origi- 
nalthe bible of the architects of the 
Renaissance, which still profoundly influ- 
ences our classical architecture. Besides sev- 
eral score of Latin editions and translations 
into foreign languages, there have been three 
previous translations into English, those of 
Newton, 1791, of Wilkins, 1813 (three books 
only), and of Gwilt, 1826. None of these, 
naturally, can show the ripeness of classical 
scholarship or the benefits of modern archseo- 
logical research which the present version 
enjoys through Professor Morgan, through 
the editor (Professor A. A. Howard), and 
through Professor Warren, who has prepared 
the illustrations. These advantages, together 
with the picturesque and characteristic En- 
glish in which Professor Morgan has managed 
to preserve the flavor of the original, make it 
doubtless the definitive translation. The illus- 
trations show a comparison of the prescrip- 
tions of Vitruvius with actual classic exam- 
ples, usually those which correspond most 
nearly to them. The notes which Professor 
Morgan had intended, both textual and ex- 
planatory, he did not live to supply, but the 
translation and illustrations by themselves are 
sufficient to be of very great interest both to 
architects and to scholars.

His first novel, " Home/' was published about a 
year and a half ago. 

Mr. Arthur Waugh has a little volume of essays 
in the press, under the title of " Reticence in Lit-

ranging from Crashaw to George Gissing. 

A collection of Cowley's " Essays and Other 
Prose Writings," edited by Dr. Alfred B. Gough,

An official guide book for scientific travellers in 
the West is being prepared under the auspices of 
the Pacific Coast Committee of the American Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Science, and will 
be published this month by Messrs. Paul Elder & 
Co., of San Francisco. The articles, popular in 
form but written with scientific precision, will

edited by Professor I. Gollancz. 

Samuel T. Pickard, biographer and literary 
executor of John Greenleaf Whittier, died last 
month at the Whittier homestead in Amesbury, 
Mass., at the age of eighty-seven. He was editor 
and proprietor of the Portland (Maine) " Tran- 
script " from 1852 to 1894. In addition to numer- 



ous monographs, reviews, and literary articles, he 
wrote "Hawthorne's First Diary," "Whittier 
Land," and "Life and Letters of John Greenleaf 
Whittier." 

Mr. G. H. Perris is writing a narrative of " The 
Campaign of 1914 in France and Belgium," which 
Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton hope to have ready 
next month. The author was in Brussels at the 
outbreak of the war, and, leaving there with other 
refugees for Paris, afterwards acted as special 
correspondent of the " Daily Chronicle." The first 
book on the war by a Belgian officer is coming from 
the same publishers "Fighting with King 
Albert," by Capitaine Gabriel de Libert de 
Flemalle. 

A Danish correspondent to the London "Nation" 
writes that the war is leaving its mark on interna- 
tional publishing. After mentioning that, before 
the war, Germany had shown an almost insatiable 
appetite for translations of foreign books, he adds 
that a leading German publisher has just an- 
nounced that he has done with Gabriele d'Annun- 
zio. According to this publisher, d'Annunzio has 
attacked Germany merely out of hatred, and he has 
not even the excuse that his country has suffered 
through the war. 

A new publishing house has been incorporated in 
New York City, under the name of Robert Apple- 
ton, Inc., by Mr. Robert Appleton, grandson of the 
founder of the house of Messrs. D. Appleton & Co. 
The first work announced is " Intercollegiate Ath- 
letics in America," a chronicle of collegiate sport 
in the United States to be completed in five vol- 
umes. Among the contributors will be Messrs. 
Samuel Crowther, Parke H. Davis, Romeyn Barry, 
Harry A. Fisher, Raymond D. Little, James A. 
Babbitt, and Richard M. Gummere. 

Lord Cromer has written a supplementary vol- 
ume to his "Modern Egypt," which will be pub- 
lished this month by Messrs. Macmillan. It is 
called "Abbas II.," and it covers the fifteen years 
between the death of Tewfik Pasha, in 1892, and 
Lord Cromer's departure from Egypt in 1907. 
Lord Cromer's view of Abbas's character was 
obtained at close range, and was quite as unfavor- 
able as its subject deserved. Lord Cromer and 
Abbas never " got on," for, indeed, it was hard to 
respect the ex-Khedive either as a man or as a 
ruler. 

The work of Stijn Streuvels, the Low-Dutch 
author who is regarded both in Belgium and Hol- 
land as among the most distinguished writers of 
our time, is to be introduced to English readers by 
Mr. A. Teixeira de Mattos in a volume of sketches 
and stories which he has translated from the West- 
Flemish dialect under the title of "The Web of 
Life." Stijn Streuvels's real name is Frank 
Lateur. Until ten years ago his home was at Avel- 
ghem, close to Courtrai and the Lys, where he 
earned his living as a baker. " The Web of Life " 
belongs to that period. 

Mr. H. Noel Williams has already a considerable 
number of biographies of famous Frenchwomen to 
his credit. He is about to add to the number by 
" The Life of Margaret d'Angouleme." This time,

THE DIAL, 



[ March 4 



at least, Mr. Williams has chosen a subject that 
abounds in literary interest. Margaret was not 
only the author of the " Heptameron " but the 
patroness of a group of men of letters that included 
Rabelais, Clement Marot, and Bonaventure des 
Periers, and the influence of her Court makes one 
of the most fascinating chapters in the history of 
the Renaissance in France. 

If any of the friends of John Muir have missed 
his Alaskan dog story, " Stickeen," they should by 
all means look it up. Its general circulation would 
go a long way in reducing the residuum of cruelty to 
animals which man seems to have brought down 
with him from primitive savagery. Since its origi- 
nal publication, a few years ago, the Houghton 
Mifflin Co. have included it in their " Riverside 
Literature Series," printed in large type and neatly 
bound in cloth, for only twenty-five cents. It is a 
story which children and grown-ups alike will read 
with intense interest, and all friends of dumb ani- 
mals ought to assist in promoting its circulation. 

Professor Gilbert Murray, in addition to his new 
verse translation of the "Alcestis " of Euripides, 
has in preparation a revised edition of " Carlyon 
Sahib," the play which, originally written in 1893, 
was first produced by Mrs. Patrick Campbell in 
the summer of 1899, and published in book form 
in the following year. " ' Carlyon Sahib ' and 
'Andromache,' " writes the author, " were really 
companion studies of two views of life, the two that 
we now associate with the names of Nietzsche and 
Tolstoy respectively, although at that time I do not 
think I had heard of Nietzsche. 'Andromache' 
shows a Tolstoyan heroine living and eventually 
prevailing in a primitive society based upon re- 
venge and force ; ' Carlyon ' a kind of superman 
hero trying, and eventually failing, to find scope in 
modern civilization." 

" Like many other readers," says a writer in the 
London " Nation," " I have been trying to keep up 
with the deluge of books about the war, or at any 
rate, to miss nothing of importance which would 
help to a better knowledge of the greatest event in 
contemporary history. But a glance through 
Messrs. Lange & Berry's annotated bibliography, 
' Books on the Great War,' just published by 
Messrs. Grafton, has almost driven me to give 
up the attempt. I find that, excluding reprints, 
pamphlets, poetry, sermons, and so forth, more 
than a hundred and eighty books on the struggle, 
all of them with some claims to attention, have been 
published since the beginning of August. And if a 
reader had gone through all these, he would still be 
faced by the heading ' Poetry, Songs, and Plays,' 
with nearly fifty entries ; ' Religion, Sermons, 
Prayers, and Hymns,' with more than seventy; 
and ' Humor,' with a score, to say nothing of the 
mountain of pamphlets. If the output continues 
at this rate and it shows no signs of slackening 
future historians who take account of all the mate- 
rial will need to be long-lived men. Historians, by 
the way, have lost no time. More than a score of 
histories are chronicled by Messrs. Lange & Berry, 
the most important being M. Gabriel Hanotaux's 
' Histoire Illustree de la Guerre de 1914,' which is 
appearing in monthly parts."

A New Novel for Discriminating Readers 
by the Author of "Old Mole" 

Young Earnest 

By GILBERT CANNAN 

Mr. Cannan's new novel will scarcely 
appeal to the average reader, for it is not an 
average novel. But the intelligent reader 
will find it wonderfully interesting and 
intellectually stimulating. It is a remark- 
able characterization of a young man whose 
ideals are just beginning to crystallize, and 
his groping search for perfect happiness in 
love and work. It is the kind of book one 
likes to read slowly, for every page is full of 
charm, insight, and wisdom. 

" It is far the best novel that Mr. Cannan has yet 
written an admirable piece of work." Pall Mall 
Gazette. 

"Mr. Cannan is a master in the art of dissecting 
human emotions." New York Times. 

"A fine imaginative insight and an honest facing 
of reality and its problems combine to give unusual 
distinction to Young Earnest. "-^-Chicago Evening Post. 

"Full of admirable observation, clearness of vision, 
subtle interpretation. A work women should read, for 
they will learn much about the other sex, reputed 
easy to understand." The English Review.

magazines and papers for you so that you would always 
know in advance of prize contests, changes in editorial 
policies, suspensions, changes of address, requirements of 
new publications, film manufacturers, etc. Your imagina- 
tion goes no further. A friend of this admirable type would

FOOTINGS FOR FAITH 

By WILLIAM PIERSON MERRILL, Pastor of the 
Brick Presbyterian Church. 

The writing of this volume was prompted 
by the various influences, mostly produced by 
modern science, which have brought such con- 
fusion and such doubt into the minds, especially 
of the younger people of to-day. This doubt it 
aims to dispel by recognizing religion and con- 
temporary scientific thought.

TWO IMPORTANT BOOKS 

JUST PUBLISHED 



Heredity and Environment 
in the Development of Men 

By EDWIN GRANT CONKLIN 

PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY IN PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 

"One of the ablest discussions of the problem 
that we have yet seen. ... In addition 
to being one of the American authorities on this 
subject, Dr. Conklin has the happy faculty of 
being able to make the intricacies of science 
interesting to the layman." Publisher's Weekly. 

"There is no higher type of scientific research 
than that which applies to the origin of man and 
the agencies which operate for his development 
to the highest type, and Prof. Conklin has done 
a great work in this direction in these lectures." 
Wilmington Every Evening.

at Northwestern University.

The Scotch- Irish in 
America 

By HENRY JONES FORD 

PROFESSOR OF POLITICS IN PRINCETON UNIVERSITY 

"The 'plantation' of the north of Ireland, 
principally by Scottish settlers; the formation of 
the 'Scotch-Irish' 'breed,' the emigration of a 
host of its members to America and their influ- 
ence in shaping early American history and insti- 
tutions form a historical sequence so logically 
complete that it is a wonder the representatives 
of that interesting, energetic and cohesive 
element in the American racial composite have 
so long permitted their history to rest in widely 
dispersed and not easily accessible documents, 
records and fragmentary essays. Professor 
Ford's painstaking research leaves little material 
available for aftercomers, and his compact, 
straightforward presentation leaves nothing to be 
desired in respect of literary dress. " N. Y. Sun.

The Modern Study of Literature. By RICHARD GREEN MOULTON, 

Head of the Department of General Literature in the University of Chicago. 

An introduction to literary theory and interpretation by the Head of the Depart- 
ment of General Literature in the University of Chicago. The purpose of this work is 
to discuss the Study of Literature : what it must become if it is to maintain its place in 
the foremost ranks of modern studies. The author's previous well-known books on 
literary criticism and his long and successful experience in the public presentation of 
literature have especially fitted him for the authoritative discussion of this great problem 
of modern education. i2mo, cloth; $2. 50, postage extra. 

Senescence and Rejuvenescence. By CHARLES MANNING CHILD, 

Associate Professor of Zoology in the University of Chicago. 

This book presents as the results of certain experimental methods of investigation 
some definite knowledge concerning the processes of senescence and rejuvenescence in 
the lower animals. The most important result of the investigation is the demonstration 
of the occurrence of rejuvenescence quite independently of sexual reproduction. The 
book differs from most previous studies of senescence in that it attempts to show that 
in the organic world in general rejuvenescence is just as fundamental and important a 
process as senescence. 8vo, cloth; $3.00, postage extra. 

University Of Chicago Sermons. By Members of the University Faculties. 
This book contains eighteen sermons delivered by as many leading men from the 
faculties of the University of Chicago. In each sermon appears the best thought of 
a well-known scholar on a particular phase of religious life. The contributors include 
representatives not only of the biblical and theological departments of the University, 
but also of education, sociology, and philosophy. A combination of modern scholarship 
and pulpit power that makes a volume of religious inspiration for both minister and 
layman. I2mo, cloth; $1.^0, postage extra. 

Religious Education in the Family. (Constructive Studies, Ethical 

Group.) By HENRY F. COPE, General Secretary of the Religious Education Association. 

The author deals with the real meaning of religious education in and through the 
home and its significance to society. He interprets past customs and recommends 
many new and definite practices for the direction of the child's religious ideals and 
activities. To the sane discussion of family worship, church-going, the Bible in the 
home, and Sunday occupations, the author adds illuminating chapters on the family 
table, stories and reading, week-day activities, the school, moral crises, and other vital 
topics. A book especially valuable for parents' associations and classes, and all indi- 
viduals and organizations interested in child welfare and the promotion of a Christian 
type of home. I2mo, cloth; $1.25, postage extra. 

The City Institute for Religious Teachers. (Principles and Methods 

of Religious Education.) By WALTER S. ATHEARN, Professor of Religious Education 

in Drake University. 

A city institute is the result of the application of the common-sense business principle 
of combination of effort and resources to the problem of training Sunday-school teachers. 
It unites Christian people in the support of the work of religious education as they are 
united in the work of upholding the common schools. The author of this book, Pro- 
fessor Athearn, of Drake University, has ably demonstrated the practicability of the 
institute plan in the city of Des Moines, Iowa, where more than thirty churches have 
for several years combined their forces in a teacher-training institute. A book that 
shows Sunday-school workers a unique yet thoroughly 'tested plan for gaining efficiency 
in teaching. i6mo, cloth; 75 cents, postage extra.

THE DARKENED FOREGROUND. 



In the Altman collection of the Metropolitan 
Museum in New York there is a magnificent 
specimen of the work of the great landscape 
painter Ruysdael. In the foreground of the 
painting, where in Nature (for it is mid-day 
or thereabouts) everything would be the clear- 
est and most distinct, Euysdael has thrust a 
broad wedge of night. There is a road, there 
are some fallen trees, a few figures; but 
scarcely anything can be distinguished. Why 
did the artist do this ? Well, on either side of 
this darkened space slope rye fields which we 
feel we could wade through if we could reach 
them; in the rear is a farmstead with trees 
peaceful and alluring and absolutely true in 
tone and scale ; and back of all is the real dome 
of the sky, with rising clouds as magnificent as 
have ever been drawn by man. By falsifying 
his foreground, Ruysdael secured all the other 
truths of his picture. 

In an art so various as painting it is foolish 
to generalize. It is possible in depicting inte- 
riors, those builded by either nature or man, to 
plunge the foreground objects into light and 
get some sort of distance by means of lurking 
shadows behind. It is possible to throw a veil 
over everything, and thus shirk the presenta- 
tion of strong light and shade. It is possible to 
paint decoratively with harmonies of colors 
which have little relation to reality. There 
are new schools in painting which reject the 
imitation of nature altogether. But in the 
main the method which Ruysdael so boldly dis- 
plays in this picture is the method of painting. 
Compared with the infinite variety of nature's 
illumination, an artist's pigments are so dull 
that if he puts the real hues in the front of his 
picture he will have exhausted all his grada- 
tions of tint before he reaches his middle dis- 
tance, and will have nothing at all left for his 
background or sky. So he "fakes" his fore- 
ground, and lies about the nearest and dis- 
tinctest visibilities. 

Painting is confined, or ought to be confined, 
to one moment and one division of space. Lit- 
erature introduces duration and a multiplica- 
tion of spaces, and is therefore immensely more 
complex. But we think that there is in the 



192 



THE DIAL 



[ March 18 



best literary art something analogous to the 
painter's principle of darkening the fore- 
ground. Literature's poverty of resource as 
compared with life is even more apparent than 
that of painting. There are something like 
thirty million seconds in a year, and each one 
of them may be productive of an emotion or a 
situation. Every personage in a piece of lit- 
erature must pass through innumerable 
scenes; but only a few of these scenes can be 
given. To get proportion, vividness, reality, 
the writer must select his moments and his 
locations properly. To get distance, large- 
ness, vision, he must more or less obscure his 
foregrounds. 

That a vast deal of modern literature has 
followed an exactly opposite principle, has 
dealt only with the near and the new, is 
nothing to the purpose. A vast deal of mod- 
ern literature, judged by the work which has 
lasted, is wrong. Take, for example, Tolstoi's 
enormous novel, "War and Peace." It has 
been called an epic; but it precisely contra- 
venes every epic law. It is all foreground. 
Each figure in it is painted as distinctly as 
every other. When we try to call it up in 
memory we can only think of a confused med- 
ley, with no one figure or scene emerging dis- 
tinctly. It is a wonderful work of genius in 
detail; but a bound volume of a newspaper 
would have almost as much claim to be called 
a work of art. 

The sooner we recognize that life and litera- 
ture are separate businesses the sooner we 
shall begin to produce something worth while 
in the latter field. Life is huge, confused, hap- 
hazard. Accident, sickness, death, the peril of 
the elements, thrust into it. The contradic- 
tory and the unexpected make up a large part 
of its happenings. Unless there is some ob- 
scure law of evolution guiding it, there seems 
to be no direction and no purpose except the 
very definite determinations to live, to work, to 
strive, to enjoy, to exhaust itself. A piece of 
literature is small, ordered, disciplined. It 
bears the law of its maker's nature. It bor- 
rows its material from life, and of course it 
may react enormously on life. It is its mak- 
er's report of some part of the vast phantas- 
magoria of life, his judgment upon it, and 
perhaps his vision of something different from 
it. The main point is that it subjects the med- 
ley of life to a certain discipline. 

At first blush it might seem that comedy is 
an exception to the rule of art's separation 



from life and from the principle of the dark- 
ened foreground. Comedy is, though not 
essentially yet in usual practice, a contempo- 
rary creation. It steps right off from the 
street. Yet take the greatest comedy the last 
century produced, that of Dickens. The 
grime, the gloom, the squalor of London, are 
used to set off his gigantic figures of fun. The 
principle of contrast is invoked, and out of 
their almost unbearable conditions Micawber. 
Sairey Gamp, Dick Swiveller, the Wellers, and 
a hundred more rise in a riot of animal spirits 
ten times more living than life. The light, 
bright comedy of Meredith is weak and unsub- 
stantial in comparison. It may be objected 
that the gloom and squalor of London existed, 
and that Dickens merely painted what he saw. 
But he undoubtedly put more of them in his 
prescription than life's recipe would call for. 
And he might have ignored them altogether, 
as did Meredith and most of the rather watery 
humorists and novelists who have followed 
him. But he exaggerated, as all great artists 
have done. The hostess of the inn which was 
the supposed scene of Burns 's "Jolly Beg- 
gars" protested that hers was a perfectly 
respectable house and that no such crew of 
tatterdemalions had ever gathered there. The 
lady suffragists of Athens probably hated 
Aristophanes for his three woman comedies, 
and the priesthood of France certainly hated 
Rabelais. Comedy at its greatest is an upset- 
ting and irreverent thing, and uses a great deal 
of lampblack. Even in the ideal comedy of 
Shakespeare there is plenty of shadow, and the 
principle of contrast is maintained. The 
tempest and the wreck precede Ariel and 
Miranda and the voices of the island. The 
Jew sharpening his knife comes before the 
moonlight scene at Belmont. The unjust 
brother, the jealous Duke, and the wrestling- 
match are a prelude to the forest loves and 
friendships of Arden. 

Tragedy in literature, if it is to be effective, 
must of course be removed and separated from 
ordinary life. In its thrilling moments on the 
stage they darken the house to bring out the 
full effect. We should probably laugh at a 
great deal of tragedy if it was not carefully 
prepared for, and solemnized by its surround- 
ings. How little the tragedies of life, of 
course barring our own, impress us! Every 
morning newspaper has a score, a hundred of 
them to report. We glance at the head-lines, 
yawn and toss the sheet aside. It takes an

earthquake, a holocaust, to move us a little. 
Yet an artist can take one of the least incidents 
in the news and by properly subordinating 
other things to it can win us to sympathy and 
tears. A certain remoteness and loftiness are 
necessary to the greatest tragic effects. Make 
your hero a king, said Aristotle, and then peo- 
ple will sympathize. Either we do not feel 
that ordinary life is good enough for tragic 
trappings, or we secretly believe that we are 
princes and princesses who have been changed 
in the cradle and so only sympathize with our 
kin. Here, too, of course, the modern spirit 
has tried to nullify the teaching of ages. 
Democracy has wanted to be tragic, as it has 
wanted all other good things. Mr. James and 
Mr. Howells have shown us the plots and per- 
plexities that attend the lives of the great 
suburban class. Dostoieffsky has revealed to 
us the fortunes and fates of criminals. Mr. 
Hardy has tried to lift up those trodden 
flowers of the world, Tess and Jude. But we 
are entirely unconvinced that these creations, 
charming or powerful as they may be, will per- 
manently or even for a time usurp the places 
of the kings and captains and great ladies 
of Shakespeare or Scott. The human instinct 
for believing the best of itself is against them. 
Even in contemporary popularity, their mak- 
ers are beaten out of the field by novelists like 
Mrs. Ward and Miss Corelli, who do, in a way, 
put their trust in princes. 

Poetry, absolute poetry, must be more or 
less removed from life, it must keep its dis- 
tance. It does keep its distance by means of a 
special language, a special movement and 
ordering of words, an atmosphere of its own. 
With its purple robes, its round of gold about 
its brow, its inspired air, it becomes ridiculous 
when it steps down into the forum or the 
drawing-room, -among men clad in tweeds or 
women in Paris fashions. The vulgar cannot 
understand it ; they would indeed have to be 
born again to enter its heaven. It is for the 
young and unspoiled, for the solitary enthusi- 
asts, for the dreamers brooding over the secrets 
of the universe. That is the reason why politi- 
cal poetry is such a doubtful good, and why 
humorous poetry is almost a contradiction in 
terms. The best poetry, too, has its foreground 
shadow. There is a good deal to be said for 
Poe's theory that melancholy is the highest 
poetic motive. Joy may be, and indeed almost 
always is, vulgarized, but sadness can never 
be vulgarized. 



We have now gone the round, and may get 
back to Ruysdael's picture, which we hope we 
have shown has a lesson in it not only for 
painters but for literary artists. Nay, it is not 
without a bearing on morality. The Delecta- 
ble Mountains and the fair skies are generally 
separated from us by a bar of shadow, strug- 
gle, suffering. "Can you have all this and 
heaven too?" said Lyman Beecher's rustic 
parishioner, as to his shocked eyes were re- 
vealed the horsehair sofa, the marble-topped 
table, and the plush-covered album of the min- 
ister's parlor. Modern life and art and litera- 
ture, womanized, have tried to put light and 
joy into the foreground. But it won't do! 
We must work through shadow into glory ; we 
must earn our kisses by kicks; we must run 
the gauntlet before being acclaimed a warrior.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE LATE LIBRARIAN OF THE HISPANIC SO- 

CIETY, Winfred Robert Martin, whose recent 
death has called forth glowing tributes to his 
virtues and talents, was evidently the strong- 
est possible contrast to the typical book- 
custodian of olden times. But how could he 
have failed to be, sprung from a father of such 
varied and unusual gifts as those possessed 
by the Rev. William Alexander Martin, who 
survives his son? The elder Martin's mis- 
sionary and diplomatic services in China, and 
his published works in English and Chinese 
for he both speaks and writes the latter diffi- 
cult language have won for him a more than 
local distinction. A similar or even wider 
range of interests and aptitudes is to be noted 
in the son, whose skeleton biography in 
"Who's Who" shows him to have been a 
Princeton graduate, of the class of 1872; a 
bachelor of law, New York University ; a doc- 
tor of philosophy, Tubingen ; a doctor of laws, 
Trinity College; professor of oriental lan- 
guages at Trinity from 1888 to 1907 ; instruc- 
tor in Sanskrit at the Hartford Theological 
Seminary from 1902 to 1907 ; librarian of the 
Hispanic Society of America from 1907 until 
his death; and member of various American 
and foreign learned societies. But first and 
last he seems to have been preeminently a 
teacher, a kindler of zeal for knowledge in the 
breasts of others, as is plain from the testi- 
mony of his former pupils and of those who 
came into inspiring contact with him else- 
where than in the classroom. In the sixth 
chapter of Professor William Lyon Phelps's 
"Teaching in School and College" occurs this 



194 



[ March 18 



attesting passage : ' ' The teacher must not be 
a mere hearer of recitations. He should not 
exclusively confine himself to discovering 
whether or not the pupils have made sufficient 
preparation. In many of our recitations at 
school and college we never expected to learn 
anything ; never did, anyhow : we simply an- 
swered formal questions. So fixed was this 
idea in our minds, that our first interview with 
a new instructor in the Hartford High School, 
Mr. "Winfred R. Martin, one of the greatest 
teachers I ever knew, was not only disastrous 
to us, but we nearly broke out into open rebel- 
lion. He asked us things that were not in the 
notes! Later we found him a constant and 
powerful inspiration. Even at that early age 
we obtained from him a notion of the meaning 
of true scholarship. He was and is a profound 
and original scholar, a man of varied and 
amazing learning, and we respected him for 

it." 



UNDERDONE ENGLISH might be a good term 
to apply to those alien words that elbow their 
way into our speech without showing any like- 
lihood of ever becoming naturalized in spell- 
ing or pronunciation. Ennui, for instance, 
will never be thoroughly English, and as long 
as we have tedium and boredom it will not be 
needed. Wanderlust, which we still write 
with an initial capital, in the German manner, 
and usually pronounce as the Germans do, if 
we are able, might well enough be unreservedly 
adopted, and written and spoken as good 
English, which indeed it is. As Professor 
Brander Matthews sensibly remarks, in a cur- 
rent magazine article on pure English, "if a 
word is now English, whatever its earlier 
origin, then it ought to be treated as English, 
deprived of its foreign accents, and forced to 
take an English plural. ' ' He continues : "No 
one doubts for a moment that cherub and 
criterion, medium and index can claim good 
standing in our English vocabulary, yet we 
find a pedant now and then who still bestows 
upon these helpless words the plurals they had 
to use in their native tongues, and who there- 
fore writes cherubim and criteria, media and 
indices, violating the grammatical purity of 
English." Many will have noted the pitfalls 
laid for the unwary and the uneducated in 
these foreign plurals: the use of data as a 
singular noun is now so common that presently 
we shall have the lexicographers bending to 
popular custom, and stamina already receives 
from them a sort of half -recognition as a singu- 
lar noun. The height of absurdity is attained 
in cherubims, which is not unknown in the 
speech of the uneducated. Another absurdity 
is met with in the lavish use of the French 



feminine adjective to designate brands of 
cigarettes, confectionery, and other merchan- 
dise. Thus we have "Egyptienne cigarettes" 
(not cigarettes egyptiennes) and "Premiere 
chocolates." At some restaurants the guests 
are treated to "spaghetti Italienne," as well 
as to "bullion soup," "consomme" (unac- 
cented), and other philologically wonderful 
dishes. Of course the French expression in 
full, of which the feminine adjective is often 
the surviving remnant, is familiar enough; 
but that does not make good English or fault- 
less French of "string beans Parisienne" or 
' ' lamb chops with Hollandaise sauce. ' ' Those 
who are interested in the preservation of our 
tongue in its purity will enjoy reading the 
aforementioned article in the March issue of 
"Harper's Magazine." 



BOOKS FOR SPECIALISTS are among the most 
costly works known to the book trade. They 
may be out of print, rare, and all but unob- 
tainable ; or, if current publications, they may 
represent such an excess of labor and expense 
in their preparation, compared with the lim- 
ited demand they are likely to meet, as to ren- 
der their purchase an impossibility for most 
individual students and for all but the largest 
libraries. Hence the importance, to special- 
ists, of knowing just what great public collec- 
tions of books are strong in their particular 
fields. Among American libraries noted for 
their resources in these special departments, 
the Newberry Library of Chicago enjoys a 
deserved repute. Its librarian 's latest Report 
has some pages of interesting reading that 
illustrate the zeal and intelligence constantly 
devoted to the strengthening of the various 
special collections in the library. That this 
effort is not wasted becomes evident from the 
testimony of the call slips. "It is a note- 
worthy fact, ' ' records the librarian, ' ' that the 
most highly specialized divisions of the library 
are the ones whose books show a steadily 
increasing use. The casual visitor or person 
unfamiliar with the materials of research 
usually picks out just these divisions in which 
to ask the invariable question, 'But does any- 
one ever call for or need such books as these ? ' 
And the necessarily affirmative reply evokes 
with equal invariability a politely skeptical 
smile." But the facts speak for themselves. 
' ' For example, the Prince Louis Lucien Bona- 
parte Library consists of some 18,000 volumes, 
chiefly relating to the various languages, dia- 
lects, and patois known to have been spoken or 
employed as a medium of literary communica- 
tion in Europe during the past two thousand 
years. Few persons are able to make intelli- 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



195 



gent use of these works except trained philolo- 
gists and advanced students of literary and 
linguistic origins. And yet, well over 3,000 
volumes were drawn from this collection for 
reading or consultation during 1914, while 
during the five-year period, 1910-14, nearly 
15,000 volumes have been put at the service of 
readers. The case is the same with the Edward 
E. Ayer Collection of Americana, an ex- 
tremely specialized library of original sources 
printed, manuscript, and graphic." It is 
a theory of librarians, which library expe- 
rience tends to confirm, that there is no book 
in any library that will not, sooner or later, 
find its reader. 



THE PERIODICITY OF ANECDOTES can hardly 
equal in regularity the recurrence of the 
spring and neap tides, or the successive re- 
turns of Encke's Comet, but there is no ques- 
tion that the same popular story has a way of 
taking repeatedly new forms and enjoying 
fresh favor. It is not improbable that some 
neat situation, having tickled some one's fancy 
either in real life or as an invention of the 
imagination, may again independently present 
itself in fact or fancy a half-century or so 
later; just as the man in Ohio re-invented the 
screw-propeller a generation or more after it 
had been successfully applied to ship-propul- 
sion. Or the same good story may have simul- 
taneous birth in two distant places, after the 
manner of the Adams and Leverrier coinci- 
dence in astronomy. Mark Twain's "Jump- 
ing Frog" is one of those unfailingly popular 
stories that might, without violence to proba- 
bility, have moved to laughter a knot of idlers 
on the banks of the Nile five thousand years 
ago, or a group of loungers on the strand at 
Aulis, at a somewhat later date. In fact, its 
occurrence, in Greek form, in the pages of 
Professor Henry Sidgwick's "Greek Prose 
Composition" gave rise to the belief that the 
tale was of Athenian origin, and even its 
author was deceived until the translator ac- 
knowledged his deed. Familiar to observant 
readers is the frequent recurrence, with or 
without change of form, of the greater part of 
our best jokes and anecdotes. The humorous 
department of a justly-esteemed American 
magazine prints this month the supposed 
answer of a schoolboy to the question, What 
is the backbone ? The definition is hoary with 
age : ' ' The backbone is a long, straight bone. 
Your head sits on one end, and you sit on the 
other." Three months ago we retold (with 
due credit given) Miss Effie L. Power's story, 
from "How the Children of a Great Library 
Get Their Books, ' ' of the small boy who begged 
the librarian to extend the time on his book 



because he did not dare go home and get it for 
fear of being made to take a bath. Soon 
afterward one of our English exchanges repro- 
duced as new this St. Louis story with a Lon- 
don setting ; and so it promoted the gaiety of 
at least two nations within two months. 


A MAN OF INFINITE VARIETY, which age can- 
not wither nor custom stale, is he whose recent 
pamphlet, "Commonsense about the War," 
shocked and alienated so many of his former 
admirers and set the world at large to dis- 
cussing with renewed curiosity this Protean 
and perplexing personality. Whether one 
considers him a genius or a mountebank, a 
seer or a charlatan, a philosopher or a mad- 
man, a constructive reformer or a ruthless 
iconoclast, Mr. George Bernard Shaw remains 
a perennially interesting, even fascinating, 
member of the human race. To him who in 
the love of Mr. Shaw holds communion with 
his visible forms he speaks a various language ; 
for his gayer hours he certainly has a voice of 
gladness and a smile, though he may not ex- 
actly glide into his darker musings with a mild 
and healing sympathy. Proof of something 
like universality in his genius is found in the 
rather amusing assurance with which one after 
another of those that have studied him venture 
to affirm that they alone really understand 
him and can interpret him to the world. Mr. 
Chesterton has expounded the real Bernard 
Shaw an exposition in which the subject 
utterly failed to recognize himself, and Mr. 
Archibald Henderson has laboriously pre- 
sented another real Mr. Shaw ; and Mr. Shaw 
himself has all the while, naturally enough, 
maintained that he himself was his only trust- 
worthy interpreter, and that the innumerable 
current opinions and impressions of him were 
all, or mostly, wrong; and, finally, we have 
another self-confident expositor, Mr. John 
Palmer, demolishing (in the pages of the cur- 
rent "Century") all the hitherto accepted 
notions of Mr. Shaw's character and explain- 
ing him anew to a mistaken world. Reduced 
to the conciseness of an algebraic formula, 
here is the latest solution of the "G. B. S." 
puzzle : ' ' The ideas of Bernard Shaw == the 
commonplaces of his time. The ideas of Ber- 
nard Shaw -f- his way of presenting them = 

G. B. S." 



SUGAR-COATING THE PILL OF REJECTION will 
never greatly lessen its bitterness, and many 
there are who prefer to take their pill, if take 
it they must, undisguised by this thin layer 
of saccharine deception. A certain editor of 
our acquaintance used to publish a soothingly 
plausible statement that there were no rejec-

tions in his office, but that after such literary 
offerings as best met existing needs had been 
selected the rest were restored with appro- 
priate thanks to their obliging senders. In 
somewhat the same spirit the head of the Bos- 
ton Public Library smilingly explains, if the 
reporter has not misinterpreted him, that "in 
the purchase of fiction no books are ' censored, ' 
as that term is generally understood. We 
choose books, and that implies that some will 
be bought and others not bought. No doubt 
many books are not taken which are as good as, 
even better than, some that are taken. But, in 
choosing, various elements must be considered 
besides literary merit; for example, adap- 
tability to uncultivated readers, human inter- 
est, unquestioned moral tone, and the fitness 
of the book for circulation, practically without 
formality, upon open shelves, free to readers 
of all ages." As to the somewhat celebrated 
volunteer board of fiction-tasters that so faith- 
fully serves the library, Mr. "Wadlin adds: 
"The volunteer committee which reads new 
fiction simply gives its opinion of the books, 
the way in which each strikes a reader of aver- 
age attainments; it is not intended to give a 
literary judgment only, though that point is 
not overlooked, and what a reader says about 
a book is never conclusive as to its purchase. ' ' 
Some books, though approved by this com- 
mittee, are not bought, and others, though not 
approved, are bought. "That a book is not 
bought simply means that in the exercise of 
choice some other book was thought preferable, 
all things considered." After this the free 
advertisement given to a novel by its rejection 
on the part of the Boston Public Library ought 
to lose some of its commercial value. 



ENCOURAGING TO BOOK-DEALERS of the pres- 
ent are certain episodes in the book-trade of 
the past. Mr. James Milne writes, in the 
course of a recent "London Letter" to "The 
Book Monthly": "We have to recognise, in 
the first place, that it is going to be a long 
war, possibly a very long war. It cannot, in 
the nature of things, be as long as the Napo- 
leonic wars of a century ago; but as a cata- 
clysm it may be compared to these, and 
perhaps we may derive some encouraging les- 
sons from them. If you remember, ' Waverley, ' 
the first herald of Sir Walter Scott's genius, 
was published in the year before Waterloo. 
His other stories began almost immediately to 
pour out ; and generally, while Pitt was fight- 
ing Napoleon, English literature was not 
merely not quiescent, but remarkably produc- 
tive. If this was possible then, why should it 
be different now when the field of authorship, 
if it be not so great in masters, is very much 



larger in area? If 'eighteen hundred and 
war-time' was more than a passably good 
period for English authorship, is there any 
reason why 'nineteen hundred and war- time' 
should not also see good work and plenty of it 
in English literature?" Yet it should be 
borne in mind that warfare a century ago was 
not the tremendous and exhausting perform- 
ance that it is now. Also, as the writer admits, 
we have not, or are not conscious of having, 
any Walter Scott at present producing Waver- 
leys for the entertainment and delight of the 

reading public. 



A FORGOTTEN CARLYLE MANUSCRIPT, never 

published, and, except to a few bibliophiles, 
not known to be in existence, has come to light 
among the literary treasures of a collector at 
Norfolk, Virginia, and at the present writing 
is about to pass to the highest bidder at the 
Henkels auction rooms in Philadelphia. It is 
entitled ' ' The Guises, ' ' and is said to be forty- 
six folio pages in length, closely written in the 
familiar crabbed penmanship of its author, 
and to contain about twenty thousand words. 
Its date is given as 1855. As its title indi- 
cates, it gives the history of the house of Guise 
from the first duke of that name. As it has 
to do with a part of Europe where history is 
just now violently in the making, let us quote 
a characteristic fragment from the opening 
page. "Lorraine, Lotharingen, fell, not to the 
first Lothar, who was Charlemagne's grand- 
son, but to a 2d Lothar (who married that 
one's daughter), but whose pedigree, relation- 
ships to men and things, and general bio- 
graphic physiognomy in this world remains, 
as is usual with these poor people, irretriev- 
ably dark to me, weltering in endless im- 
broglios of Carlovingian ramifications and 
disjecta membra; unknown now I do believe 
to all the living; for how can you know it? 
Riddle it out for yourself, with much dis- 
gusting conscientious labour, you straightway 
proceed to forget it again: thrice over that 
has been our experience." 



READING IN THE TRENCHES varies the deadly 
monotony of killing and being killed. In Ger- 
many the call for books to be distributed in 
the field and in military hospitals is said to 
be such as to have caused a remarkable de- 
velopment of the travelling-library system, if 
that is the right term to apply to the mech- 
anism whereby literature is supplied to the 
soldiers of the fatherland. The Royal Library 
at Berlin, acting as a receiving and distribut- 
ing centre in this good work, sends out four 
thousand volumes daily to the front and to

hospitals. A Berlin publishing house, that of 
Ulstein & Co., has subscribed a large sum for 
the crating and packing of these books, and 
two express companies carry the boxes without 
charge. A Hamburg agency reports the re- 
ceipt of two hundred and three hundred books 
a day for distribution, and many other coop- 
erating agencies are similarly active. Both 
individual donors and publishing houses are 
contributing the reading matter that through 
these various channels flows to quench the 
book-thirst of the soldiers. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 



WAB AND POETEY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The interesting article under the above caption 
in your issue of March 4 has suggested this ques- 
tion in my mind: Is it not the violently partisan 
spirit pervading most of the verse of the present 
war which is chiefly responsible for its failure to 
measure up to high poetical standards? The good 
poet is not necessarily a good patriot, love of 
humanity is with him a far more vital and com- 
pelling impulse than love of country; and he sees 
too deeply and widely into the great complex of 
life ever to believe that in war, as in any other 
form of conflicting human relations, it is always a 
clear case of the devils against the angels. There is 
infinite poetical material in this European drama; 
but it lies leagues beneath the surface aspects dealt 
with by the "patriotic" bards, with their hack- 
neyed variations on the chords of vituperation and 
self-righteousness. It lies in the tragedy of the 
individual soul, whether English, French, Ger- 
man, Russian, or what not; it is to be found in 
the experiences of almost countless men and women 
who have made every sacrifice and suffered every 
agony of which humanity is capable and for a 
cause of which not one in ten thousand could give 
a coherent or plausible explanation. 

To me the most striking poem yet evoked by 
the war is Mr. W. N. Ewer's " Five Souls," pub- 
lished in the London " Nation " last autumn. As 
it has never been reprinted in this country, so far 
as I know, perhaps you may be willing to let me 
share it with your readers. 

" FIRST SOUL. 
" I was a peasant of the Polish plain ; 

I left my plough because the message ran : 
Russia, in danger, needed every man 
To save her from the Teuton ; and was slain. 
7 gave my life for freedom This I know : 
For those who bade me fight had told me so. 

SECOND SOUL. 

" I was a Tyrolese, a mountaineer ; 
I gladly left my mountain home to fight 
Against the brutal, treacherous Muscovite; 
And died in Poland on a Cossack spear. 
I gave my life for freedom This I know: 
For those who bade me fight had told me so. 



THIRD SOUL. 

I worked in Lyons at my weaver's loom, 
When suddenly the Prussian despot hurled 
His felon blow at France and at the world ; 
Then I went forth to Belgium and my doom. 
I gave my life for freedom This I know : 
For those who bade me fight had told me so. 

FOURTH SOUL. 

I owned a vineyard by the wooded Main, 
Until the Fatherland, begirt by foes 
Lusting her downfall, called me, and I rose 
Swift to the call and died in fair Lorraine. 
/ gave my life for freedom This I know: 
For those who bade me fight had told me so. 

FIFTH SOUL. 

" I worked in a great shipyard by the Clyde. 
There came a sudden word of wars declared, 
Of Belgium, peaceful, helpless, unprepared, 
Asking our aid : I joined the ranks, and died. 
I gave my life for freedom This I know : 
For those who bade me fight had told me so." 

This may not be great poetry in form, but is not 
its truth and power as " a criticism of life " beyond 
question? The essential folly and tragedy of war, 
the blind devotion to leaders, the beauty of self- 
sacrifice, all this and much more glows through 
these simple lines, and makes the poem worth (to 
me, at least) a ton of the " mad Kaiser " and " per- 
fidious Albion " sort of thing with which we have 
for months been deluged. RALPH BRONSON.

A TEXTUAL DIFFICULTY IN MILTON. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

If I may be permitted to offer my conjecture on 
the textual difficulty in the tenth book of Milton's 
" Paradise Lost," suggested by the communication 
in your issue of March 4, I should like to venture 
the following. 

The whole situation, briefly stated, seems to be 
this : Sin and Death had just completed the giant 
causeway, and " now descried their way to earth, 
first tending to Paradise" (1. 325), when the meet- 
ing with Satan, which is under consideration, took 
place. Now the question arises, Where shall we 
locate these three spirits of evil? 

It appears to me that this may be done quite 
satisfactorily by first gathering together the most 
important visualizing data of this structure, and 
of the flight of Satan returning to his palace in 
Hell. That great " pontifice " was evidently " high 
arched" (1. 301), to begin with, a fact we must 
not lose sight of, if we wish to follow Milton's 
description of this path through Chaos. A little 
further on we learn that Satan, while " steering 
his zenith betwixt Centaur and the Scorpion " 
(1. 328), or somewhere near what we might per- 
haps coldly term the limits of our solar system, 
"met who to meet him came" (1. 349), namely, 
the aforesaid Sin and Death. Here, I think, we 
should bear in mind that he is returning, not has 
returned, to Hell, as your correspondent apparently 
conceived him to have done; he was on his way, 



198 



THE DIAL 



[ March 18 



but not yet arrived there. All the text gives us is, 
that after Eve was " seduced," " to Hell he now 
returned" (11. 332-346); "returned" being here, 
according to the general context, a simple narrative 
imperative, not a participle, as our original inquiry 
seems to suggest in the expression : " At the mo- 
ment of meeting Satan is represented as l now 
returned to Hell/ 1. 346." 

This contention being taken for granted, we 
may claim that Satan only came upon the first 
incline of the unsuspected highway, when he met 
his fellow-spirits. He was only " steering his 
zenith," after having risen from Paradise, and 
reached the bounds of our atmospheric sea, wing- 
ing his way as an angle of light (1. 327), and 
apparently unconscious of " a passage broad, 
smooth, easy, inoffensive" (1. 305), and obligingly 
prepared by his children. Espying the latter, he 
no doubt descended or "lighted from his wing," 
" and at sight of that stupendous bridge his joy 
increased," and he stood long admiring (1. 350). 
And the part of the bridge where he would be most 
likely to stop and praise, as he soon did, would be 
right here, rather than at the door of Hell, or at 
the end of his flight. 

Approximating, then, the view from this ethereal 
spot, or trying to do so, we ought not to do vio- 
lence to the imagination in undertaking to fix it too 
rigidly, and with too strict a localism. Neverthe- 
less, for a scientific age there is perhaps nothing 
so agreeable here as at least a half-way probable 
mathematical precision in the location of this 
meeting-point. This could be done by thinking of 
this whole magnitude of space as a great cosmic 
spherical triangle, with Hell and Paradise at the 
lower apexes and the point in question at the top; 
and the " stupendous bridge," or " the three several 
ways in sight, to each of these three places " (1. 
323), as the bi-sectors of the three angles of this 
imaginary triangle. Then the bi-sector of the Para- 
dise-angle would curve downward to Earth, the 
bi-sector of the Hell-angle would curve down to 
Hell-gates, and the bi-sector of the upper angle 
would incline "near to Heaven's door" (1. 389). 
Thus the intersection of all three bi-sectors would 
be the point of meeting in our discussion. 

But inasmuch as Satan was only between " Cen- 
taur and the Scorpion," not yet out of reach of our 
solar system, he was at the " brink of Chaos " (L 
347), "near the foot of this new wondrous ponti- 
fice." If then we consider that this monstrous 
structure was curved and " high arched," and that 
the segment reaching to earth was probably shorter 
than the one running down to Hell (11. 320-323), 
Sin and Death could easily descend to Paradise 
and Satan likewise descend " down to Hell." 

And yet, after all, the imaginative freedom of 
poetry almost revolts at such a matter-of-fact ex- 
planation! Suffice it to say that Milton here 
neither " nodded," nor gave an amanuensis cause to 
commit a blunder at once fatal to true poetry and 
vexatious to her conscientious student. The won- 
derful constructive imagination of the master mind 
simply took such a magnificent flight that ours of 
the lesser wing was at first unable to follow.

SOME ANTI-GERMAN MISCONCEPTIONS 
CORRECTED. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Mr. Wallace Rice's communication in your issue 
of February 16 contains a few errors of fact which 
you may wish to correct. 

1. The representatives of Alsace-Lorraine in the 
Reichstag are elected by universal suffrage; and 
this suffrage is conceded to be as free and un- 
hampered as any in the world. Alsace-Lorraine 
has fifteen representatives, and at the last elec- 
tion two of these represented the French party, 
while thirteen represented the various German 
parties. 

2. With the exception of Mecklenburg, all Ger- 
man states have different constitutions than they 
had before 1848. 

3. The Constitution of the German Empire of 
1871 is a liberal document, and should not be over- 
looked by those who wish to discuss German Con- 
stitutions. 

4. Most Germans who emigrated to America did 
not do so because " life was unendurable to them 
in the Fatherland," but because they believed that 
America offered opportunities which none of the 
European countries could afford to encourage. To 
draw conclusions unfavorable to Germany from 
the presence of many millions of people of Ger- 
man stock in this country is erroneous unless one 
wishes to draw similar conclusions as to the other 
countries whose sons have settled here. The aver- 
age emigration from England for the past ten 
years has been over 200,000, while the emigration 
from Germany has practically ceased. 

5. Nobody who knows modern Germany can be- 
lieve that the Bourbon maxim, " Everything for 
the people, nothing by the people," is effective in 
Germany to-day. One glance at the German con- 
stitution, as well as familiarity with the workings 
of the Reichstag, will disprove this assertion with- 
out question. 

6. England has more " frightful slaughters on 
her mind " than any other nation, perhaps because 
the extension and maintenance of her world empire 
amid less civilized people has made greater de- 
mands on her. The suppression of the Indian 
mutinies, the Egyptian River War described by 
Mr. Churchill, the Boer War with its concentra- 
tion camps and Lord Roberts's proclamation issued 
from Pretoria, and finally the oppression of Ire- 
land, prove this. 

7. During the Civil War almost 200,000 Ameri- 
cans of German descent fought for the Union; 
while " the Germans in this country," as Mr. Theo- 
dore Roosevelt says, " were largely responsible for 
keeping Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri in the 
Union." Nobody thought any the less of these 
people at that time; nor did any one doubt their 
loyalty because they were proud of their German 
descent. 

It is very unfortunate if the natural difference 
of opinion prevalent as to the right or wrong in 
the European War induces the Anglo-Saxon ma- 
jority or the Teuton minority to doubt each other's 
loyalty to their joint country.

THE NEW MOVEMENT IN DRAMATIC 
PRESENTATION.* 



A "new movement" in art or in anything 
else generally goes through three stages. 
First, an idea is conceived by some genius, or 
by a few people of genius sometimes working 
together, sometimes separately, and is appre- 
ciated by a few people who are apt nowadays 
to be scattered about all over the world. Next, 
it begins to come to public notice and is found 
so interesting that people write, first articles 
then books about it or the people concerned 
with it. Every one begins to know something 
about it or the people concerned with it, and 
it has for a time a popularity which is often 
enough factitious and short-lived. Later* 
everybody knows about it, takes it as a matter 
of course, and then its true power begins to 
tell widely, if there be enough in it, because 
the people at large are familiar enough with 
it to be able to get at its true spirit. This has 
happened with all sort of things, and not in 
matters of art alone. 

The "new movement" in the theatre is still, 
in America at least, in the second stage. For 
ten or twenty years there have been innova- 
tions in stage presentation, Greek plays, 
Shakespearean settings, out-of-door plays, 
"Yellow Jackets," and the like. And for as 
many years there have been people here and 
there who understood and appreciated them, 
sometimes many, sometimes few. Now, how- 
ever, after a good many articles, criticisms, 
magazines, and what not, there are appearing 
books which offer a general account of the 
matter. "We are beginning to wake up to the 
idea that here is something important. Just 
how important, people might not agree. Mr. 
Archibald Henderson, in his chapter on newer 
tendencies in "The Changing Drama," calls 
it ' ' this art of the future which stands out as 
the most significant tendency of the contem- 
porary drama." Mr. Henderson is (among 
other things) one of the most widely read 
dramatic critics of our day ; few know as well 
as he what is "up" in the dramatic world, 
what are the currents of present-day thought, 
what people are thinking, dreaming, doing, or 
trying to do. He views as most significant 
this effort to give form and body to the play. 
Most significant or not, good or bad, here is a 
lear enough case; everybody knows some- 
thing about it. We have now two books, each

THE THEATRE OF MAX REINHARDT. By Huntly Carter. 
Illustrated. New York : Mitchell Kennerley. 



of which gives something of a broad treatment 
of the subject ; one the general account of the 
conditions of the theatre by Mr. Moderwell, 
the other Mr. Huntly Carter's book on Max 
Reinhardt. This latter book makes the well- 
known producer of the Deutsches Theater the 
basis of a general treatment. Mr. Moderwell 
gives a more generally planned account of the 
matter, but is more especially interested in the 
work of Mr. Gordon Craig. As is commonly 
known, these two men have for some years 
been the leading innovators in the new Art of 
the Theatre. 

If I had to choose between the two I should 
choose Mr. Moderwell 's book, and that not 
because I agree with him in his admiration 
for Mr. Craig, although I do, but because he 
gives a well-ordered and well-worked-out gen- 
eral treatment of the whole subject. He 
would appear to have a more systematic mind 
than Mr. Huntly Carter, who, when he gave 
a while ago an aper^u of the whole field, got 
his material together in a form which must 
have stood in the way of many who would 
have liked to know something about the subject 
he was presenting. Nor does Mr. Moderwell 
seem to me less appreciative and under- 
standing because he is more systematic. He 
has by no means the arid idea of the pure stu- 
dent and investigator. In fact, his mind 
appears to act in much the same way as other 
men's, which is a great advantage when one 
tries to explain matters to one's fellows. The 
reader will find in his book general ideas and 
principles, as well as particular details and 
events ; he can get the general view and also 
learn facts, dates, and so on. 

Mr. Huntly Carter views the New Theatre 
through the medium, as we may say, of Max 
Eeinhardt, the director of the Deutsches 
Theater. It is a good thing that he has done 
so, for there is no other thorough treatment of 
Reinhardt 's work in English. He does not, 
however, give a definite biography ; in fact the 
title of his book shows that it is the dramatic 
or theatrical art that is of interest to him 
rather than the personal development. And 
in this matter Mr. Huntly Carter is known to 
have much information and knowledge. Max 
Reinhardt is the man who has actually done 
most in the new art of dramatic presentation. 
For ten or twelve years now he has given plays 
in Berlin, plays of all kinds: "Salome" by 
Oscar Wilde, "The Lower Depths" by Gorky, 
"Pelleas and Melisande" by Maeterlinck, 
"Electra" by Hofmannsthal, "Candida" by 
Shaw, "Rosmersholm" by Ibsen, as well as the 
staid old plays of Shakespeare, Moliere, and 
Goethe. He has naturally put on the stage the 
plays of others, many of whom had no idea at 



200 



THE DIAL 



[ March 18 



all of the kind of stage upon which their works 
were destined eventually to appear : Sophocles 
and Shakespeare wrote their plays for theatres 
very different from anything Reinhardt was 
likely to use. So in a lesser degree with 
Moliere and Goethe. The same thing was 
doubtless the case with many writers of our 
own day; Gorky and Maeterlinck probably 
took little account of the possibilities of the 
modern stage, whatever we may think of 
Hofmannsthal and Ibsen. Reinhardt seems to 
stand for an idea that Mr. Henderson gives 
us : "In the light of Croce's theories, I should 
like to stress the fact that in the presentation 
of a drama we have the most intricate and com- 
plex form of critical reproduction." Rein- 
hardt is, as one may say, a critic, interpreting 
the works of the great dramatists of any and 
all time, just as .Wilhelm Meister interpreted 
"Hamlet," putting them so that people in 
general will really get at them. 

There is, however, another way of doing 
things in this dramatic movement, namely, 
that which is generally associated with the 
name of Mr. Gordon Craig. Similar as his 
work is in many ways to that of Reinhardt, 
yet if we may judge from his writings it has a 
different spirit and motive power. Mr. Craig 
has been engaged in presenting the work of 
others : he has not been able to present many 
plays; he has no such imposing record of 
interpretations as Reinhardt; but the few 
things he has done have made an immense 
impression, his "Hamlet" and "The Blue 
Bird ' ' at Moscow, especially. To us in Amer- 
ica that matters less because we know these 
things chiefly by book, and Mr. Craig is most 
widely known by his writings. If we call Max 
Reinhardt critical, we may say that Gordon 
Craig is creative. He thinks of something 
other than simple presentation or interpreta- 
tion ; in his "Art of the Theatre" a few years 
ago he presented the idea of a creative artist 
using all the means of the drama and the thea- 
tre to embody his thought. THE DIAL has 
already printed some studies of his ideas 
apropos of his books. 

I have mentioned Mr. Moderwell's book as 
presenting the ideas of Mr. Craig. This gives 
only a slight idea of the book, which is an ex- 
cellent treatment of the whole matter of the 
theatrical art of to-day. The mechanical forces 
are described, the different innovations in the 
form of the stage, the revolving stage, the 
rolling stage, the sliding stage; the arrange- 
ments for scenery, like the cyclorama or the 
horizont; the different developments in light- 
ing. The matter is also considered more or 
less at length from the artistic standpoint, and 
also with reference to what is being done in 



this country. Design, color, light, three 
matters so fundamental in the newer ideas, 
are dealt with. The literary forces are con- 
sidered, namely, the dramatists now at work 
throughout the world. The book ends with a 
consideration of the social and economic 
forces; and in fact we have a very general, 
all-around treatment of the subject, not at all 
limited to any particular view or school. I do 
not, in fact, know of any other one book which 
gives a better introduction to the dramatic 
world to-day, unless it be that of Mr. Hender- 
son's already quoted, which takes the subject 
rather from the dramatic standpoint, the point 
of view of literature, as Mr. Moderwell views 
it from the theatrical standpoint, that of the 
stage. 

Mr. Moderwell's book is a good accompani- 
ment to those of Mr. Gordon Craig in giving 
an idea of the theatre, not so much as the 
means of interpreting the work of great 
dramatists, as a means whereby the artist may 
express himself. That is the new ' ' Art of the 
Theatre"; just as an artist may express him- 
self in painting, music, poetry, architecture, 
or in many other well-recognized ways, so he 
may express himself by the much more com- 
plex means of the theatre, which calls for the 
use of poetry, painting, music, architecture, as 
well as acting, dancing, pantomime, costume, 
and so on. "The drama as the culminating 
synthesis of all the arts" is Mr. Henderson's 
expression. The artist of the theatre is a 
creator rather than a critic. This is rather an 
art of the future: even Mr. Gordon Craig, 
who is very busy fashioning his instrument, 
has not yet played upon it, at least so far as 
the world in general is concerned. 

Although Mr. Huntly Carter seems some- 
thing of a partisan, I see no reason why one 
should think of any necessary antagonism be- 
tween the critical and the creative schools of 
presentation. Even though the creative view 
appeal to one most, as it does to me, there is 
no getting away from the other. Create as 
much as possible, there must always be the 
critical presentation, unless we are content to 
let all the great drama of the past sink into 
nothingness. There will always be the pre- 
sentation of Shakespeare, for instance, unless 
Mr. Shaw should succeed in his ill-concealed 
effort to make away with him in the public 
mind. It will never be possible to present 
Shakespeare in the way he was originally pre- 
sented, we can never produce just the im- 
pressions that he produced in the way he did ; 
if we could reconstitute the Elizabethan actor 
and the Elizabethan play-house we could never 
reconstitute the Elizabethan audience. So 
there must always be the modern presentation 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



201 



of Shakespeare and of the other great masters 
of the drama, and that, as a rule, by means of 
which they did not dream. Even the dram- 
atists of our day, unless devoted "men of 
the theatre, ' ' must often be in ignorance of the 
means whereby their imaginations will be real- 
ized; indeed, they must often see their own 
imaginations realized in ways better and more 
adequate than they had conceived themselves. 
The critical presentation will even be the most 
common. It is presumably easier, for one 
thing ; in the drama, as elsewhere, one will find 
many men of critical ability for one of any 
creative power. It is also more widely useful ; 
in learning the Art of the Theatre, as in learn- 
ing any other art, whether for creative pur- 
pose or merely for general culture, one must 
deal with the work of earlier masters. Great 
geniuses have developed without the training 
of schools and conservatories, and on the other 
hand the confining effect of traditional criti- 
cism has been long understood. Yet in the 
main, genius likes to view the work of genius. 
One cannot learn the Art of the Theatre out of 
one's head, nor are there many schools like Mr. 
Craig's at Florence; the young artists of the 
theatre must learn their art by seeing plays 
produced, and it will certainly be hard on 
them (as on the public) to see only the plays 
of their own time and generation and even 
moment, as might be the case if the creative 
artist of the theatre dominated the situation. 
There must always be critics of the theatre, 
like Max Reinhardt, who has never sought 
himself to create, save perhaps in a minor way. 
Yet the ideas of Mr. Craig are singularly sug- 
gestive. The practical man will doubtless 
think it improbable that we shall ever have 
many dramatic artists who can both conceive 
a dramatic idea and themselves bring it to 
presentation, even with the assistance of prop- 
erly subservient specialists in acting, lighting, 
music, and so on. It is probable that we shall 
never have very many, but certainly we shall 
have none at all unless a beginning is somehow 
made. And making once a good beginning we 
may find it not so impossible to continue as it 
may have once appeared. 

To me, if I may add a sort of obiter dictum, 
such matters appear most likely to be fruitful 
in a direction not often noticed, namely, in 
developing a dramatic audience. I know of 
nothing that makes one understand a play bet- 
ter than to try to present it. If you want to 
understand "Hamlet," get a company of your 
friends to act "Hamlet," even though you 
can get nobody to come and see you. The 
study you will have to give the play will give 
you an appreciation you never have had be- 
fore, especially if you can yourself assume the 



task of directing the performance. But more 
useful even than the presenting the works of 
others is the presenting plays of one's own 
upon no matter how small a scale provided it 
be done with any real consideration of the 
needs and necessities of the case. You may 
give your performance at one end of a parlor, 
on a High School stage, at a Club smoker, or in 
a garden, or anywhere else. Provided you 
realize your dramatic opportunities and use 
them in an artistic way, you are getting some- 
thing on the Art of the Theatre that you can- 
not get even by going to see other people act 
every night in the season and reading plays in 
books all the rest of the year. Only one must 
do the thing in the best way with the view of 
the artist of the theatre, not necessarily of 
Mr. Gordon Craig or any particular person. 
And a public made up of people who were 
accustomed to such matters, who took stage 
presentation as naturally as they did reading, 
would be one which would appreciate the work 
of the masters better than ours does now.

Two YEARS IN HURRICANE LAND.* 



After the thrill and exultation attending the 
conquest of, first, the North Pole and then, 
within a brief space, the South Pole, it might 
seem that further exploration of Arctic or 
Antarctic regions must partake of the nature 
of an anticlimax ; and in some sense this can- 
not but be true. No other pushing into the 
unknown can quite equal in excitement the 
pursuit of that infinitesimal point where all 
the meridians meet and there is no longer any 
East or any West. But just as the discovery 
of America did not exhaust the possibilities of 
occidental exploration and adventure, so the 
achievements of Captains Peary and Amund- 
sen have rather stimulated than deadened 
eagerness to learn more of the secrets of the 
frozen polar seas and undefined continents. 
Among those best equipped by nature and 
training to supplement the work of those 
earlier explorers, Sir Douglas Mawson, of Ade- 
laide University and a member of the Shackle- 
ton expedition of 1907-9, .is not the least 
conspicuous. His organization and leadership 
of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition of 
1911-14 placed him among the foremost of 
skilled and resourceful and intrepid adven- 
turers into the vast unknown of Antarctica, 
"the home of the blizzard," as he calls it in 
the title to his elaborate work descriptive of 
that expedition, now published in two hand-

some volumes, with every accompaniment of 
colored and uncolored illustration, of map and 
diagram and appendix, that the exigent reader 
could desire except that the more scientific 
or technical fruits of the undertaking are 
reserved for future presentation. 

As explained in the opening chapter, the 
design of the expedition was to land a party 
of five men on Macquarie Island, about half- 
way between Australia and the Antarctic con- 
tinent, this party to be equipped with wireless 
apparatus for communication with the ex- 
plorers southward and with Hobart to the 
north, and to carry on certain assigned investi- 
gations, while the rest of the company took in 
hand the more arduous and hazardous ex- 
ploration of the little-known regions lying 
within or near the Antarctic Circle between 
King George V Land on the east and Queen 
Mary Land on the west, or over a stretch of 
nearly sixty degrees of longitude. This latter 
work was to be done by several parties oper- 
ating separately but in pursuance of one well- 
considered scheme, which embraced researches 
in geography, oceanography, meteorology, 
glaciology, geology, biology, bacteriology, the 
study of tides, wireless and auroral observa- 
tions, and terrestrial magnetism. In addition 
to the chief's account of the expedition as a 
whole, and of his own activities as organizer 
and leader, as first in command at the "main 
base" in Adelie Land, and as engaged in a 
particularly toilsome and dangerous excur- 
sion to the eastward across King George V 
Land, the book contains subordinate and al- 
most equally interesting narratives from the 
pens of those who led forth other parties on 
their several more or less perilous quests. 

Even those who have had but slight expe- 
rience in roughing it with an outing party will 
appreciate what the author has to say on the 
extreme importance of care in selecting the 
men with whom one is to winter and summer 
in the wilderness. Mental and physical equip- 
ment for the work in prospect is not enough, 
though it is indispensable ; moral quality must 
also be insisted upon. 

" In no department can a leader spend time more 
profitably than in the selection of the men who are 
to accomplish the work. Even when the expedition 
has a scientific basis, academic distinction becomes 
secondary to the choice of men. Fiala, as a result 
of his Arctic experience, truly says, ' Many a man 
who is a jolly good fellow in congenial surround- 
ings will become impatient, selfish and mean when 
obliged to sacrifice his comfort, curb his desires 
and work hard in what seems a losing fight. The 
first consideration in the choice of men for a polar 
campaign should be the moral quality. Next should 
come mental and physical powers.' " 
Of interest, too, is this further specification of 



attributes essential to success in the peculiar 
task here under consideration : 

" For polar work the great desideratum is tem- 
pered youth. Although one man at the age of fifty 
may be as strong physically as another at the age 
of twenty, it is certain that the exceptional man of 
fifty was also an exceptional man at twenty. On 
the average, after about thirty years of age, the 
elasticity of the body to rise to the strain of 
emergency diminishes, and, when forty years is 
reached, a man, medically speaking, reaches his 
acme. After that, degeneration of the fabric of the 
body slowly and maybe imperceptibly sets in. As 
the difficulties of exploration in cold regions ap- 
proximate to the limit of human endurance and 
often enough exceed it, it is obvious that the above 
generalizations must receive due weight." 

The men selected with proper regard to this 
Oslerian age limit comprised a party of about 
forty, including the five ship's officers and 
several temporary members of the expedition, 
and all but one seem to have fulfilled expecta- 
tion in respect to physical hardihood. That 
one, Dr. Xavier Mertz, a Swiss of exceptional 
ability and promise, and not yet thirty years 
of age, succumbed to exposure and an insuffi- 
ciency of nutrition on the arduous expedition 
already mentioned which was led by Dr. Maw- 
son. The other member of this party, Lieuten- 
ant B. E. S. Ninnis, a youth of twenty- three, 
also lost his life on the way, falling with sledge 
and dogs through a crust of snow covering a 
crevasse. These two, it appears, were the only 
ones who failed to survive the rigors and 
perils of the enterprise. 

Most tragic and grimly impressive is the 
story of that ill-fated excursion from which 
only the leader, after indescribable sufferings 
and hair-breadth escapes, returned to the 
friendly shelter of winter quarters. That a 
month of lonely struggle and semi-starvation 
(the last dog had been sacrificed) in those icy 
solitudes should have left him with reason 
unimpaired and bodily powers not perma- 
nently weakened, is almost beyond belief, and 
speaks volumes for his virility. The tempta- 
tion to let go his grip, in more senses than one, 
evidently assailed him with increasing fre- 
quency as the margin of possible endurance 
became narrower. A passage from his diary 
illustrates that strange mingling of the awful 
and the trivial, the sublime and the ridiculous, 
that many a reader will have noted in his own 
experience at moments of exceptional trial or 
danger. 

" Going up a long, fairly steep slope, deeply 
covered with soft snow, broke through lid of 
crevasse but caught myself at thighs, got out, 
turned fifty yards to the north, then attempted to 
cross trend of crevasse, there being no indication of 
it; a few moments later found myself dangling 
fourteen feet below on end of rope in crevasse

sledge creeping to mouth had time to say to 
myself, ' so this is the end,' expecting the sledge 
every moment to crash on my head and all go to the 
unseen bottom then thought of the food uneaten 
on the sledge; but as the sledge pulled up without 
letting me down, thought of Providence giving me 
another chance." 

It was a small chance, but the edge of the 
crevasse was at last gained, when a second fall, 
to the full length of the rope, followed. The 
remainder of the incident must be told in the 
author's own words: 

" Exhausted, weak and chilled (for my hands 
were bare and pounds of snow had got inside my 
clothing) I hung with the firm conviction that all 
was over except the passing. Below was a black 
chasm; it would be but the work of a moment to 
slip from the harness, then all the pain and toil 
would be over. It was a rare situation, a rare 
temptation a chance to quit small things for 
great to pass from the petty exploration of a 
planet to the contemplation of vaster worlds be- 
yond. But there was all eternity for the last and, 
at its longest, the present would be but short. I 
felt better for the thought. My strength was fast 
ebbing; in a few minutes it would be too late. It 
was the occasion for a supreme effort. New powers 
seemed to come as I addressed myself to one last 
tremendous effort. The struggle occupied some 
time, but by a miracle I rose slowly to the surface. 
This time I emerged feet first, still holding on to 
the rope, and pushed myself out, extended at full 
length, on the snow on solid ground. Then came 
the reaction, and I could do nothing for quite an 
hour/' 

Though the author modestly ascribes to a 
friendly reviser any literary merit his chap- 
ters may possess, it is plain that the pre- 
requisite of having something to say before 
attempting to say it, is all his own, and that he 
can well afford to let his style take care of 
itself. Not unworthy of a place beside the last 
recorded words of the ill-fated Captain Scott 
is the terse account of that all but desperate 
struggle to regain the land of the living after 
death had claimed the two companions of the 
outward journey. Other parts that hold the 
attention are the detailed descriptions of land- 
ing, hut-building, dog-management, and all 
the ingenuities and contrivances evolved by 
the exigencies of the time and place. Recogni- 
tion also is due to the clear style, effective and 
unwasteful of words, in which the lesser con- 
tributors to the book tell their respective tales 
of more or less exciting adventure. A later 
work presenting the scientific results of these 
two years (and somewhat more) of manifold 
investigation in an almost virgin field is prom- 
ised. Here, then, let it suffice to register 
appreciation of the more generally narrative 
and descriptive volumes. Their appearance 
and workmanship, with the large, clear type 
of the Ballantyne Press, and with their many 



strikingly beautiful illustrations, including a 
number of unusually fine colored ones, and 
their generous provision of large folding maps, 
could not easily have been improved upon. In 
only one particular, hardly important enough 
to mention, has expectation been a little dis- 
appointed : the index references seem to lack 
that scrupulous accuracy which the reviewer 
if not the general reader likes to find in a 
work of so rich and varied contents as "The 
Home of the Blizzard. ' ' 

PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



THE QUALITY' OF GENIUS.* 



The first edition of Tiirck's "Man of 
Genius" was published in Germany in 1896, 
and was so well received that other editions, 
variously revised and enlarged, rapidly fol- 
lowed one another. In all, seven editions have 
been issued in Germany up to the present time. 
The English translation, now before us, was 
prepared and printed in Germany, though 
published in London. 

Dr. Tiirck's conception of genius is a quali- 
tative rather than a quantitative one. We are 
not to regard as a genius any man possessing 
extraordinary abilities, without reference to 
their nature. On the other hand, something of 
the quality of genius is universal : as Schopen- 
hauer said, ' ' really every child is to a certain 
extent a genius." We are to consider that 
genius is an inherent power, without reference 
to performance; thus it is easy to imagine a 
man potentially capable of producing works of 
genius, hindered by circumstances from doing 
anything of consequence. What, then, is the 
essential mark of genius? It is, according to 
Dr. Tiirck (following Schopenhauer), a capac- 
ity for love, using that word in the widest 
sense, an objective tendency, which seeks 
realization through contact with the external 
world, and puts aside selfish and subjective mo- 
tives. At the same time, appreciation or love 
being the motive force, reality is idealized, and 
the world is understood in its meaning, rather 
than in its imperfect expression. This, we 
must hold, is to get at the core of truth, the 
original version of which visible things are, as 
it were, an imperfect translation. Thus we 
glide into idealism, our own nature suffusing 
and transforming external reality. 

It may properly be objected, that Dr. Tiirck 
has selected the human quality which he most 
admires and values, and has labelled it genius. 
At the same time, he is not altogether without 
warrant in this, for according to the ordi- 
nary conception of the word, genius certainly 



* THE MAN OP GENIUS.

THE DIAL 



[ March 18 



implies increased capacity for understanding 
and appreciation. Think of any man to whom 
we ascribe this quality, is he not distin- 
guished by the breadth and depth of his 
relationship to reality, by the extent of his com- 
prehension of truth ? He cannot be wholly self- 
centred, if only for the reason that his field 
would remain altogether too narrow for the 
expression of his powers. So, as we think 
about it, the simple definition which our author 
gives, "genius is love," rather grows upon 
us, and seems less absurd than when we first 
read it. 

Then, as to the idealistic outcome: is it a 
final reaction from the severity of truth, a re- 
turn to the subjectivism from which we sup- 
posed we had escaped? Perhaps so, in part, 
but it is curious to recall a rather similar 
development in the innermost sanctum of the 
most modern science. Following the path first 
indicated by Mendel, we have explored the 
maze of heredity in directions he never knew, 
and find ourselves contemplating every living 
being as a compromise between what is and 
what ' ' might have been. ' ' Not at all as a mat- 
ter of idealism, but by calculations having 
almost the validity of mathematics, do we 
postulate the potential qualities of this or that 
descendant of known ancestors, and estimate 
the deviation from the fullest expression, due 
to this cause or that. Are we, then, to blame 
the philosophical idealist, who, looking beneath 
the surface of things, discerns often a half- 
expressed meaning, and values the outcome 
partly for the implied purpose ? Crass anthro- 
pomorphism, if you like, but we cannot do 
without it. Repeat a thousand times, things 
are what they are, and even in science we can 
never forget that they are also, in a genuine 
sense for us, what they are not. 

It is rather more difficult to follow our 
author in some other matters. Growing out 
of the idea of the disinterestedness of genius, 
there is developed the conception that the ac- 
tivity must be its own justification, rather than 
any particular end to be gained. In any 
intense work, it is certainly true that the mind 
is centred upon the activity itself, and the end 
to be gained may be quite nebulous or unreal- 
ized for the time being. Under such circum- 
stances the work is pleasurable; whereas if 
the end alone is in view, it becomes a burden. 
Dr. Tiirck goes so far as to assert that the high- 
est work, thus accomplished, is of the nature 
of play, and states in several passages that the 
genius is primarily interested in what he is 
doing, and cannot take the world and its needs 
very seriously. He thus dismisses the future, 
as it were ; he has neither hope nor fear ; in a 
word he is free from care. Here we think the 



extremes meet, and we find that our genius is 
after all in danger of landing in that very mire 
of selfishness from which he had escaped. We 
are confirmed in this opinion when we find the 
author lauding Napoleon as a man after his 
own heart. 

This breakdown of the whole theory, as it 
seems to us, is especially apparent in the ex- 
tremely interesting chapter on "Hamlet." 
The play is analyzed quite fully from Dr. 
Tiirck 's point of view; and whatever we may 
think of this, the boldness and originality of 
the treatment command admiration. The idea 
is, that Hamlet was a genius in the fullest 
sense of the word, capable of great ideas, of 
seeing things in the large, incapable of nar- 
rowness and selfishness. He grew up believing 
in the general goodness of men and things, 
supposing that the love of his mother and the 
respect of all men for his father were due to 
the latter 's good qualities alone. When he 
finds that the same respect and love are given 
to one who has indeed power, but is in all other 
respects unworthy, the whole fabric of his 
idealism collapses. He finds, too, that Ophelia 
has none of the high qualities which he sup- 
posed must go with so lovely a form. Conse- 
quently, although he is not wanting in courage 
and other manly qualities, he sees things in too 
large a way to care very much about mere 
revenge, about a deed which will not, can not, 
set the whole world right. It is not a matter 
of conscience, of moral uncertainty, but of 
lack of interest in a mere detail of the wretch- 
edness of things. Dr. Tiirck states that this 
explanation occurred to him one day when 
reflecting on the passage in the Gospel of 
Matthew, in which Christ asks "Who is my 
mother ? and who are my brethren ? And he 
stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, 
and said, Behold my mother and my breth- 
ren ! " It struck him that Hamlet, in like man- 
ner, had gone beyond the stage of feeling 
special responsibility in connection with his 
father as distinguished from other men. 

This ingenious hypothesis surely cannot 
represent Shakespeare's meaning. As it seems 
to the reviewer, the greatness of the tragedy 
of "Hamlet," as that of "Othello," lies in the 
internal rather than the external failure, the 
wreck of an essentially noble nature which 
could not rise to the occasion. It is for this 
reason that we are more moved by these plays 
than by "Julius Caesar." To represent Ham- 
let's attitude as laudable, and put the whole 
blame on the cheapness of his environment, is 
to emasculate the work. At the same time, no 
doubt, the quality which Dr. Tiirck calls 
genius, the breadth of understanding and ap- 
preciation, may at times deprive men of that 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



205 



simplicity of purpose which is necessary to 
action. Shakespeare appears to have under- 
stood at least this, that academic life and 
thought tended to inhibit action, and his lesson 
may not be without significance for us to-day. 

Other chapters take up Goethe's "Faust," 
Byron's "Manfred," Schopenhauer and Spi- 
noza, Christ and Buddha, Darwin and Lorn- 
broso, Stirner, Nietzsche, and Ibsen. The 
treatment of "Faust" is especially detailed 
and original, but we cannot take the space to 
outline it here. Stirner, Nietzsche, and Ibsen, 
together with Lombroso, are vigorously at- 
tacked, and called antisophers. It is perhaps 
hardly fair to class Ibsen with the others, but 
his work is discussed at length, and the au- 
thor's position is made clear. We may close 
with a quotation remarkable not only for its 
pungent sarcasm, but for a certain suggestive- 
ness in relation to the attitude taken by some 
learned men with reference to the happenings 
of to-day. After describing Nietzsche's theory 
of conduct, Dr. Turck exclaims : 

" Imagine, on these lines, a speech for the de- 
fence such as the following : ' Gentlemen of the 
jury, the accused pleads guilty to having com- 
mitted a murder: I request you, however, to con- 
sider how horribly beautiful his crime is. From 
a sheer passion for murder because, as our great 
Nietzsche sayc, " his soul wanted blood ... he 
thirsted for the happiness of the knife," he de- 
coyed a child to a lonely place, and slowly killed 
it with exquisite tortures. Neither the innocently 
terrified looks of the child, the little hands con- 
vulsively clasped in despair, the small body trem- 
bling and twitching with pain, nor the pitifully 
beseeching voice and the frightful cries of the 
little creature writhing in an agonizing death 
could touch this man's heart. What sternness of 
decision and character he here showed. To whom 
would it come easy to imitate him? Who would 
not rather commit suicide than inflict such terrible 
suffering on a poor little creature? Gentlemen of 
the jury, I pray you to admire this man's strength 
of mind, " the beautiful terribleness of the deed," 
as our famous antisopher calls it, and further beg 
you to consider what this man would have been 
able to accomplish, had he been born to a throne.' "

ENGLISH LJTERATITRE ix THE ROMANTIC 
PERIOD.* 



For the earlier volumes of "The Cambridge 
History of English Literature," the editors 
fortunately secured a number of contributions 
outside of Great Britain ; in the later ones the 
custom seems to be passing. The latest volume 
contains one chapter by a French scholar, who

by A. W. Ward and A. R. Waller. Volume XI., The Period 
of the French Revolution. Cambridge, England : University 
Press. New York : G. P. Putnam's Sons. 



is the sole representative of Continental learn- 
ing. The absence of any chapter from Amer- 
ica might be explained by the fact that a 
supplementary enterprise, "The Cambridge 
History of American Literature," which is 
now in preparation, has been entrusted to 
American hands it is, indeed, mainly an 
American venture. But, as in Volume X., the 
bibliographies here and there betray an inex- 
cusable ignorance of books and articles that 
have been published in this country. One has 
a feeling that some of our English cousins 
more readily tolerate American scholarship 
when it concerns itself with Old and Middle 
English, or with the Elizabethans and Milton, 
and are less complacent when we offer to inter- 
pret the modern poets. 

Of the sixteen chapters, eight are by persons 
whom we have come to recognize as steady 
contributors: Mr. Previte-Orton deals with 
"Political Writers and Speakers"; Professor 
Sorley with "Bentham and the Early Utilita- 
rians"; Mr. Child with Cowper and with 
Crabbe; Professor Saintsbury with Southey, 
with "The Prosody of the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury," and with "The Growth of the Later 
Novel"; and Mr. Harold Routh with "The 
Georgian Drama. ' ' Practice, and an ability to 
anticipate the plans and wishes of the editors, 
are sure to tell in a work of this sort; the 
chapter by Mr. Routh, for example, is a model 
in perspective and compression, without undue 
sacrifice of interest. Nor are the authors of 
the remaining chapters all new ; Mr. Aldis has 
appeared before, and so have Mr. Henderson, 
Mr. Yaughan, and Professor Grierson. 

It would be idle to repeat the table of con- 
tents. We must single out a few chapters for 
special mention. The first, that of Professor 
Grierson on Burke, opens with a laborious sen- 
tence containing ninety-nine words and a date. 
Once in motion, however, we are carried along 
easily on a stream that more than once reminds 
us of the tide in the eloquence of the master- 
orator himself. Professor Grierson, rising to 
the height of his great argument, has produced 
an essay (if one be allowed to predict) that 
will have a lasting place in the literature on 
Burke. It is clear ; it is orderly ; it is elevated 
in tone; it displays true philosophic insight. 
And it has memorable passages, such as this 
one on Burke 's temperament : 

" The sensitive, brooding imagination, which, 
coupled with a restless, speculative intellect, seek- 
ing ever to illuminate facts by principles, gives 
tone to Burke's speeches and pamphlets; for it is 
this temperament which imparts vividness and color 
to the dry details of historical and statistical 
knowledge, and it is this temperament which at 
once directs, keeps in check, and prescribes its 
limits to, that speculative, inquiring intellect."

THE DIAL 



[ March 18 



Again : 

" Of the three means by which Cicero, following 
the Greeks, declares that the orator achieves his 
end of winning over men's minds, docendo, con- 
ciliando, permovendo, tradition and the evidence 
of his works point to Burke's having failed chiefly 
in the second. He could delight, astound, and con- 
vince an audience. He did not easily conciliate 
and win them over. He lacked the first essential 
and index of the conciliatory speaker, lenitas 
vocis; his voice was harsh and unmusical, his 
gesture ungainly. The high qualities, artistic and 
intellectual, of his speeches are better appreciated 
by readers and students than by ' even the most 
illustrious of those who watched that tall gaunt 
figure with its whirling arms, and listened to the 
Niagara of words bursting and shrieking from 
those impetuous lips.' " 

And once more : 

" Burke's unique power as an orator lies in the 
peculiar interpenetration of thought and passion. 
Like the poet and the prophet, he thinks most pro- 
foundly when he thinks most passionately. When 
he is not deeply moved, his oratory verges toward 
the turgid; when he indulges feeling for its own 
sake, as in parts of Letters on a Regicide Peace, 
it becomes hysterical. But, in his greatest speeches 
and pamphlets, the passion of Burke's mind shows 
itself in the luminous thoughts which it emits, in 
the imagery which at once moves and teaches, 
throwing a flood of light not only on the point in 
question, but on the whole neighboring sphere of 
man's moral and political nature." 

This is not the only striking chapter in the 
volume. Professor Legouis of the Sorbonne, 
whose career began with a study of the 
French officer Beaupuy mentioned in "The 
Prelude/' and whose reputation was assured 
through a notable interpretation of that poem, 
now utters, as it were, his final judgment upon 
Wordsworth. In the interval, the skill of the 
critic has not diminished, but probably in- 
creased ; his sentences are packed with thought 
and solid information ; and his conception of 
Wordsworth as carrying on the tradition of 
Rousseau, with modifications from the philoso- 
phy of Burke, is subtly elaborated, and pre- 
sented with the grace and charm which we have 
come to expect from the school of Alexandre 
Beljame. And yet one reads this chapter with a 
sense of disillusionment. It is as if the author 
had lost something of his initial interest in the 
poet. His former knowledge, which chiefly 
bore upon the early life of Wordsworth, and 
upon the proximate origins of Wordsworthian 
ideas, is duly resuscitated ; but it would seem 
that for the poet's subsequent activity M. 
Legouis to some extent has been swayed by 
secondary sources of opinion, so that the views 
expressed, while far from being stereotyped, 
and reflecting conventional criticism only in a 
general way, can hardly be said to possess the 



freshness and independence of his work on 
''The Prelude." If his estimate is conven- 
tional, this appears in his treatment of "The 
Excursion," and, still more, of the "Ecclesi- 
astical Sonnets." Indeed, it is unsafe to ap- 
praise ' ' The Excursion " as a narrative poem, 
or, as many others do, to disparage it as not 
entirely composed in a lyrical or impassioned 
style; the style was not so intended, nor yet 
was it meant to be that of an epic. "The 
Excursion" is a dialogue, and must be judged 
according to the laws governing this form of 
art; one does well to read Plato (who is not 
always impassioned) before taking up a mod- 
ern Platonist or Neoplatonist ; and it may be 
said that the poem of Wordsworth endures 
comparison with other English dialogues. As 
for the "Ecclesiastical Sonnets," so few per- 
sons look at them, not to speak of studying 
them with care, that in the popular opinion 
they would seem to be negligible. M. Legouis 
says they are ' ' the Anglican counterpart, on a 
much narrower basis, of Chateaubriand's 
Genie du Christianisme." They are, how- 
ever, founded upon good authorities, such as 
Bede and Sharon Turner, and reveal a schol- 
arly method to which Chateaubriand was a 
stranger. Montalembert, saturated with the 
spirit of the Middle Ages, praised some of them 
at least very highly. If we view them in the 
lineage, not of Chateaubriand, but of Her- 
bert and Keble, if we find their place in the 
main course, not of Continental literature, but 
of religious poetry in England, we are more 
likely to appreciate their true significance. 
One hesitates to enter the lists against an 
interpreter so expert and so well-prepared; 
but M. Legouis, as it seems to the present 
writer, has considered the poetry of Words- 
worth too exclusively in the light of imme- 
diate circumstances, and of Revolutionary 
influences and French ideals, and too little sw6 
specie eternitatis. 

The remarks of Mr. Vaughan on Coleridge 
suffer in comparison. For one thing, his chap- 
ter is marred by censurable carelessness in 
matters of detail. For example, he says that 
the beginnings of the opium habit ' ' go back as 
far as 1797"; Coleridge certainly began to 
take laudanum before that. He speaks of an 
impalpable quality illustrated by the line 
" Enclosing sunny spots of greenery," 

where Coleridge wrote Enfolding. He speaks 
of "the ghastly colors which 'patched the 
bones' of Death in a verse which the subtle 
instinct of Coleridge led him subsequently to 
strike out." "Patched the bones" is a bad 
misquotation; and the criticism of friends, 
and of the reviewers, had much to do with the 
excision by Coleridge of grotesque and repul-

sive images from "The Rime of the Ancient 
Mariner." Again, there is slipshod work in 
the statement that Southey "pronounced the 
poem to be 'an attempt at the Dutch sub- 
lime.' " What Southey wrote was, "a Dutch 
attempt at German sublimity." Pie probably 
did not think ill of the thing attempted, since 
the supernatural was his own field, and he 
could himself learn from Burger ; he thought 
the attempt awkward. But the obvious errors 
are not the only ones in the chapter. Taking 
issue with the utterance of Coleridge himself, 
" ' I cannot write without a body of thought, ' ' 
Mr. Vaughan says of ' ' Kubla Khan " : ' ' While 
thought alone, however inspiring, is powerless 
to make poetry, pure imagery and pure music, 
even without thought (if such a thing be pos- 
sible), suffice, when working in absolute har- 
mony, to constitute what pedantry alone could 
deny to be a great poem. " If it be pedantry to 
desire depth of thought in poetry and music, 
as well as in criticism, the present writer can- 
not evade the impeachment ; holding, in fact, 
the opinion of Coleridge as elsewhere ex- 
pressed : ' ' Poetry is certainly something more 
than good sense ; but it must be good sense, at 
all events; just as a palace is more than a 
house, but it must be a house, at least." As 
for the sense of the criticism, if thought be- 
comes inspiring, will it not produce something 
artistic? But can thought exist without 
imagery that is, without organic sensation ? 
Psychologists, we believe, say it cannot. And 
what does our author mean by the words, "if 
such a thing be possible"? If imagery and 
music without thought are not possible, so 
much the better for the human mind and for 
human art ; in that case, there can be no such 
thing as "pure" imagery, and no poetry that 
is "pure" sound and fury, signifying nothing; 
though there can be intentional and uninten- 
tional nonsense in both poetry and prose. ' ' If 
such a thing be possible" implies that the con- 
text in which it is found may be nonsense; 
and that is. what we strongly suspect it is. 
Instead of assuming that " 'the body of 
thought' does not obtrude itself for the simple 
reason that there is no thought to obtrude," 
how much better would be the plan of trying 
to find out what the content of ' ' Kubla Khan ' ' 
really is! As the present writer pointed out 
some years ago, the poem, when attentively 
examined, takes its place among the many de- 
scriptions of the terrestrial paradise. There 
is a description of the Tartar paradise at the 
beginning, an allusion to the Abyssinian para- 
dise in the middle, and an apparent reference 
to the false paradise of the Persian necro- 
mancer Aladdin at the end; and there are 
various reminiscences from the fourth book 



of "Paradise Lost" and from Bartram's 
"Travels" (in Florida, Georgia, etc.) inter- 
mingled; the whole being drawn together by 
no inner bond of necessary sequence, but by 
casual association. The poem is not a great 
one; its unquestionable merits do not suffi- 
ciently outweigh the latent defects for that. 
It would be greater if, as in the fourth book 
of "Paradise Lost," or in the twenty-eighth 
canto of Dante's "Purgatorio," the sensuous 
element, the flesh, had a distinct form, so as to 
give unmistakable significance to the whole. 
And beautiful and melodious as the parts may 
be, where the heart should be there is some- 
thing repulsive: Coleridge suggests that the 
place is "holy" as being the scene of demoniac 
love 

"A savage place! as holy and enchanted 
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted 
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!" 

That reminds one of the essential indelicacy of 
" Christabel, " and of other passages in which 
the poet has utilized repulsive ideas, from 
works on demonology, which may not be clear 
to the uninstructed reader, but which must be 
reckoned with in studying the genius of Cole- 
ridge. We must discover where the poet is 
laudable, and where he is open to censure. 
Mr. Vaughan praises without discrimination. 
Thus he says of "The Rime of the Ancient 
Mariner" that "the story shapes itself in a 
succession of images unsurpassed for poetic 
power and aptness": whereas Hawthorne 
called attention to the absurdity of a seaman 
going about his nautical tasks when there was 
hanging upon his neck a bird with wings meas- 
uring thirteen feet across. This is not to 
minimize the loveliness of Coleridge at his 
best ; the aim is to show the want of precision 
in an unwary critic in one who does not 
verify his references, and who has the corre- 
sponding habit of careless generalization. As 
Mr. Vaughan has previously worked in the 
field of literary criticism, it may be well to 
touch upon one matter there. In the passage 
commonly referred to ("Ars Poetica" 333-4). 
Horace does not say that "the object of poetry 
is to instruct" (p. 148). He describes what 
poets actually wish to do, dividing them into 
three classes : 

"Aut prodesse volunt aut delectare poetee 
Aut simul et iucunda et idonea dicere vitee." 

They wish either to profit, or to delight, or to 
do both in one. It is not a question of what 
they ought to do, but of characteristic desires ; 
and it is true to the facts. 

Of the chapters hitherto unmentioned, that 
of Mr. Wallis on Blake deserves high com- 
mendation. There is nothing better on the 
subject. Chapter XIV., on "Book Produc-

tion and Distribution, 1625-1800," by Mr. 
H. G. Aldis, gives a very interesting picture of 
the relations between author and publisher in 
the seventeenth century, of the activities of 
Tonson, Lintot, Dodsley, and Miller in the 
eighteenth, and of the circumstances which 
gave rise to such collections of the English 
poets as those of Bell and Johnson. Mrs. 
Aldis also does well with "The Bluestock- 
ings," and Mr. Darton with "Children's 
Books," beginning with the earliest specimens. 
The bibliography appended to this final chap- 
ter fills about seventeen pages, and is an 
achievement in itself; it should attract the 
notice of parents and teachers, who will not 
elsewhere find so excellent a guide. The 
author of the chapter is evidently responsible 
for the list. 

For several other lists the case is different, 
and the results are not always happy. In the 
Bibliography of Wordsworth, Knight's Ev- 
ersley Edition (1896) should not have been 
made a mere adjunct to his earlier and infe- 
rior Edinburgh Edition ; Mr. No well C. Smith 
should not be disguised as "Smith, C. N."; 
negligible anthologies like that of A. J. George 
should have been omitted ; and under ' ' Biog- 
raphy and Criticism," there should be more 
entries from American scholarly periodicals. 
On p. 455 the page-heading properly changes 
to "Coleridge" ; but on pp. 457, 459, reappears 
"William Wordsworth"' a confusing over- 
sight. The list of books on Coleridge mentions 
the recent bibliography of T. J. Wise, but not 
that of J. L. Haney (Philadelphia, 1903), 
which, with its entries of books and articles on 
the poet, is indispensable to students. Under 
"Biography and Criticism," Lucas's "Life of 
Charles Lamb" ought by all means to have 
been included ; it would be easy to add a dozen 
other important titles. 

In the work as a whole there is a certain 
awkwardness of arrangement. Why should 
Blake (1757-1827) precede Burns (1759- 
1796), and both follow Wordsworth (1770- 
1850) and Coleridge (1772-1834) ? 

But we must not quarrel with the volume. 
The chapters on Burke, Wordsworth, and 
Blake, which are not the only significant ones, 
would be enough to redeem it from defects far 
more serious than any we have noted. 

LANE COOPER. 



Mr. Stanley Leathes, one of the editors of " The 
Cambridge Modern History," has written a " His-

The first volume, which will be issued this spring,

the period down to the time of the general applica-

EYE-WITNESSES AT THE SHAMBLES.* 



Mr. Irvin S. Cobb's "Paths of Glory" 
easily deserves first place among recent books 
about the war. Mr. Cobb has an unusual 
talent for description, and his pages disclose 
a character typically American. He saw the 
war largely through German eyes and under 
German auspices, and he retained throughout 
something closely approximating a judicial 
poise; certainly there is always the manifest 
intention to be just and an almost meticulous 
adherence to fact. Nevertheless, the very per- 
fection of the machine, the subordination of 
the individual to the orders of an admitted 
superior, leave a sense of outraged American- 
ism behind, as in such an innocent instance as 
this: 

" The turf was scarred with hoof prints and 
strewed with hay; and there was a row of small 
trenches in which the Germans had built their fires 
to do their cooking. The sod, which had been 
removed to make these trenches, was piled in neat 
little terraces, ready to be put back; and care 
plainly had been taken by the troopers to avoid 
damaging the bark on the trunks of the ash and elm 
trees. 

" There it was the German system of warfare ! 
These Germans might carry on their war after the 
most scientifically deadly plan the world has ever 
known; they might deal out their peculiarly fatal 
brand of drumhead justice to all civilians who 
crossed their paths bearing arms ; they might burn 
and waste for punishment; they might lay on a 
captured city and a whipped province a tribute of 
foodstuffs and an indemnity of money heavier than 
any civilized race has ever demanded of the cowed 
and conquered might do all these things and more 
besides but their common troopers saved the 
sods of the greensward for replanting and spared 
the boles of the young shade trees ! " 

None of the reproduced photographs which 
accompanied the serial publication of Mr. 
Cobb's narrative have been used in his book, 
but there is no need for them, so pictorial are 
his words and so interpretative his attitude 
toward what he saw. Above all, perhaps, is 
the sincere American attitude he preserves 
from cover to cover of his interesting volume. 
He detested the thought of war before ever 
he saw it or its consequences; and when he 
was brought face to face with these he abomi- 
nated it and the spirit which calls men to

slaughter. His hatred for the wickedness of 
what he saw and sympathy with those who 
suffer from this wickedness has produced a 
work of literature, a profoundly sad criti- 
cism of life. 

Mr. Richard Harding Davis, like most of 
his countrymen, probably admired Germany 
but did not like it before he met it in war; 
since that time he has had reason for a more 
active sentiment of dislike, which he sets forth 
in his "With the Allies," recounting his expe- 
riences in Belgium from shortly after the 
German invasion of that peaceful country un- 
til the fall of Antwerp. He fell into the hands 
of German officers and for more than a day 
was under condemnation to die as a spy, in 
spite of his possession of a passport signed by 
the American minister, Mr. Brand Whitlock. 
His long experience as a war correspondent, 
almost always with regular soldiers, had not 
prepossessed him with conscript armies to 
begin with, and certain unpleasant Prussian 
habits, such as threatening civilians with a 
drawn revolver, did not change his opinions. 
His judgment of the German army is worth 
quoting, as follows : 

" It is, perhaps, the most efficient organization of 
modem times; and its purpose only is death. 
Those who cast it loose upon Europe are military- 
mad. And they are only a very small part of the 
German people. But to preserve their class they 
have in their own image created this terrible engine 
of destruction. For the present it is their servant. 
But, ' though the mills of God grind slowly, yet 
they grind exceeding small.' And, like Franken- 
stein's monster, this monster, to which they gave 
life, may turn and rend them." 

At the close of his book Mr. Davis has an inter- 
esting discussion about the war correspondent 
and the attitude of the European war offices 
toward him. It goes to bear out the general 
impression in the United States that war is so 
essentially stupid that its votaries become in- 
capacitated from seeing the rest of life in true 
proportion. 

The contents of Mr. E. Alexander Powell's 
book, "Fighting in Flanders," have all ap- 
peared in a number of American daily news- 
papers. So rapidly do the events of the war 
march, in spite of the stalemate at present, 
that the volume fails of interest through no 
fault of its own; certainly the events it de- 
scribes are of the first consequence. The most 
famous passage in it is that relating the inter- 
view between Mr. Powell and General von 
Boehn, commanding one of the armies of 
invasion, in which the American cited to him 
specific instances of atrocious conduct on the 
part of his soldiers. The German replied : 

" Such things are horrible if true. Of course, 
our soldiers, like soldiers in all armies, sometimes 



get out of hand and do tilings which we would never 
tolerate if we knew it. At Louvain, for example, I 
sentenced two soldiers to twelve years' penal servi- 
tude each for assaulting a woman." 
It is in this book that the adventures of Mr. 
Donald Thompson, the photographer from 
Kansas, are related, and they make an inter- 
esting chapter in the study of American na- 
tional character. Mr. Powell's observations 
are as follows : 

" In all the annals of modern war I do not 
believe there is a parallel to this little Kansas pho- 
tographer halting, with, peremptory hand, an ad- 
vancing army and photographing it, regiment by 
regiment, and then having a field-gun of the Impe- 
rial Guard go into action solely to gratify his 
curiosity." 

Mr. Thompson 's photographs are used to illus- 
trate the book, and bear out the conclusions of 
the text, which will probably be accepted as 
true by everybody in the world except the 
Germans. 

The "Paris War Days" of Mr. Charles 
Inman Barnard can scarcely be said to be a 
book at all, its contents comprising nothing 
more than the notes of a newspaper correspon- 
dent long resident in Paris, with occasional 
conclusions arrived at from his knowledge 
of the life there. But the author is none 
the less right in holding that even this slender 
information will be welcomed by the Ameri- 
can public as adding to the general fund of 
knowledge which has made our people, except 
such of them as refuse to read the American 
and English books and papers, by far the best 
informed in the world. Among the various 
episodes which the German government has 
not yet succeeded in explaining away is the 
reason given for declaring war, thus: 

"August 3 ... Germany officially declared war 
upon France at five forty-five this evening. The 
notification was made by Baron von Schoen, the 
German Ambassador to France, when he called at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask for his pass- 
ports. Baron von Schoen declared that his Govern- 
ment had instructed him to inform the Government 
of the Republic that French aviators had flown 
over Belgium and that other French aviators had 
flown over Germany and dropped bombs as far as 
Nuremburg. He added that this constituted an act 
of aggression and violation of German territory. 
M. Viviani listened in silence to Baron von Schoen's 
statement, and when the German Ambassador had 
finished, replied that it was absolutely false that 
French aviators had flown over Belgium and Ger- 
many and had dropped bombs." 
As a result of a conversation with M. Jules 
Cambon on his return to Paris from the 
Embassy to Germany, eked out by interviews 
with those accompanying him, Mr. Barnard 
says: 

" M. Cambon drew an important distinction be- 
tween German diplomacy and the German military

clique. The former were willing only to go so far 
as risking a war, while the latter seized the oppor- 
tunity to bring on the war and attack France. The 
discussion lasted two or three days, and the mili- 
tary caste, receiving the strong personal encourage- 
ment and support of Emperor William, became 
omnipotent, and from that moment war was in- 
evitable. In regard to France, Germany constantly 
repeated the formula : ' Put strong pressure upon 
Russia, your ally, to prevent her from helping the 
Servians ! ' To this France replied : ' Very good, 
but you yourself should put strong pressure upon 
Austria, your ally, to prevent her from provoking 
a catastrophe! " To this Germany rejoined : 'Ah ! 
But that is not the same thing ! ' Thus it was in 
that cercle vicieux that the diplomatic conversation 
continued, which, under the circumstances, and 
especially owing to the attitude of Emperor Wil- 
liam, could end in nothing else but war." 

The book is dedicated to Mr. Ogden Mills Reid 
in memory of his father, the late Whitelaw 
Reid, under whose editorship the author be- 
gan his career as a foreign correspondent. It 
bears just tribute to the value of the services 
of our ambassador, Mr. Myron Herrick. 

It was a good idea of Mr. James A. Kilpat- 
rick's to embody into permanent form the 
numerous narratives of interest that were pub- 
lished from time to time in the British and 
Irish newspapers and give it the self-explana- 
tory title of ' ' Tommy Atkins at War as Told 
in His Own Letters. ' ' By dividing the letters 
into chapters, ' ' Off to the Front, " ' ' Humor in 
the Trenches," "The Intrepid Irish," "The 
War in the Air," and so on, to the number of 
thirteen, a consecutive series of pictures is 
presented, which constitute the most vivid 
impressions imaginable. One sups so full of 
horrors day by day since the beginning of this 
most awful of all wars that strong meat in- 
deed is required to jolt the jaded appetite, but 
this book will do it. One therefore reads with 
entire accord the compiler's statement that 
"In spite of the hatreds this war has engen- 
dered there is still room for passages of fine 
sympathy and chivalry. ' ' He goes on to say : 

" One young French lieutenant distinguished 
himself by carrying a wounded Uhlan to a place of 
safety under heavy German fire, English soldiers 
have shown equal generosity and kindness to in- 
jured captives, and the tributes to heroic and 
patient nurses shine forth in letters of gold upon 
the dark pages of this tragic history." 

Even more welcome, perhaps, because it finds 
a partial excuse for an oft-repeated tale of 
violations of the laws of war by the enemy is 
contained in the following paragraph : 

" Stories of German treachery are abundant, and 
official reports have dealt with such shameful prac- 
tices as driving prisoners and refugees in front of 
them when attacking, abusing the protection of the 
White Flag, and wearing Red Cross brassards in 



action. The men have their own stories to tell. An 
Irish Guardsman records a white flag incident dur- 
ing the fighting on the Aisne : ' Coldstreamers, 
Connaughts, Grenadiers, and Irish Guards were all 
in this affair, and the fight was going on well. Sud- 
denly the Germans in front of us raised the White 
Flag, and we ceased firing and went up to take our 
prisoners. The moment we got into the open, fierce 
fire from concealed artillery was turned on us, and 
the surrendered Germans picked up their rifles and 
pelted us with their fire. It was horrible. They 
trapped us completely, and very few escaped.' 
The German defense of these white flag incidents 
was given to Trooper G. Douglas by a prisoner who 
declared that the men were quite innocent of inten- 
tion to deceive, but that whenever their officers saw 
the White Flag they hauled it down, and compelled 
them to fight." 

In some senses the most interesting of all 
these books is the one that deals least with 
actual fighting, relating the adventures of 
Millicent Duchess of Sutherland during "Six 
Weeks at the War." The Duchess left En- 
gland on August 8 to join a branch of the 
French Red Cross, and, after seeing what 
could be done that would be useful, sent back 
to her home and procured a surgeon and 
eight trained nurses and the funds needed for 
the "Millicent Sutherland Ambulance," to be 
stationed at Namur and eventually to find 
their duties at the convent of the Sisters of 
Notre-Dame there. The German occupation 
forced the English party to return about the 
seventh of September, and they did their best 
to get into France, there to continue their 
work of mercy. But it was found impossible, 
and they returned to Brussels and through 
the efforts of the American Legation soon 
reached Holland, taking ship for England on 
September 18. So remote from any custom- 
ary experience were the adventures of the 
Duchess and so far removed from the sanity 
and common sense of every-day living was the 
treatment accorded her by those she met that 
the rational mind finds almost as much sheer 
nonsense in her calm and entertaining recital 
of events as in "Alice in Wonderland." The 
English mind and the German never seemed 
quite to meet, and as the results never went 
further than to cause inconveniences sensibly 
borne, there is an element of true humor in the 
narrative. When, for example, the Duchess 
reached Brussels on her way home, she found 
herself a prisoner in her hotel with guards 
stationed at her door. She sent a note to the 
American Minister, Mr. Brand Whitloek. and 
what follows is best told by herself : 

" He most kindly came, but at my door the sen- 
tries refused to let him in. He told me afterward 
that he went to the Kommandantur and ' raised 
! ' The result was very successful. An offi- 
cer came round with him, cursed the sentries as

if it was their fault and they were removed. 
The American Minister, Mr. Brand Whitlock, is a 
very agreeable man. He had been appointed by 
President Wilson as Minister to Brussels for a rest 
cure! . . . Unfortunately for him destiny has 
checkmated his rest cure, but I am quite sure that 
this man of peace was in a great many ways check- 
mating the Germans." 

It is to be said that, though the Duchess is in 
no sense of the word a professional writer, 
she has so fully developed the faculty often 
found in women of the world of saying what 
she thinks and conveying in words how she 
feels that many a trained writer would give an 
eye for it. WALLACE RICE. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

A surprisingly good novel by Mr. Ernest 
Poole (a new writer, as far as we are in- 
formed) , is entitled ' ' The Harbor. ' ' It offers 
an epitome of American life at the present 
time, taking the harbor of New York as a 
symbol. Dante's famous description of the 
Sacred Poem might be taken as Mr. Poole 's 
text. ''The meaning of this work is not sim- 
ple, but rather can be said to be of many sig- 
nifications, that is, of several meanings; for 
there is one meaning that is derived from the 
letter, and another that is derived from the 
things indicated by the letter. The first is 
called literal, but the second allegorical or 
mystical. ' ' The author himself puts the mat- 
ter more bluntly when he makes his hero say, 
near the end of the book : "I have seen three 
harbors: my father's harbor which is now 
dead, Dillon's harbor of big companies which 
is very much alive, and Joe Kramer's harbor 
which is struggling to be born. It's an inter- 
esting age to live in. I should like to write the 
truth as I see it about each kind of harbor." 
Of the first two harbors we should say that 
Mr. Poole had written the truth ; of the third, 
we are far from certain. The transition which 
has taken place, within a generation, from the 
age of competitive individual enterprise to the 
age of organized efficiency, is clearly set before 
us. The teller of the story, which is auto- 
biographical in form, is the son of an old ship- 
master and dock-owner, whose prime has seen 
the great age of American shipping, and who, 
in his declining years, has watched its disap- 
pearance from the seas, and felt what seem to 
be the foundations of life crumble beneath his 
feet. As the boy grows up. he comes under the

spell of Dillon, an engineer whose daughter he 
marries, and who has a splendid vision of the 
city beautiful, based upon a glorified harbor 
and the most enlightened organization of its 
ancillary industries. To the boy, the harbor 
has seemed repellantly ugly, but to the young 
man, learning to know it intimately, and 
studying its various aspects under the enthusi- 
astic guidance of his chief (and father-in-law) 
it grows to be a thing of awful beauty with 
amazing possibilities for the redemption of 
social life. But working all the time counter 
to Dillon's influence is the influence of Joe 
Kramer, a college friend, a modern of the 
moderns, who scorns their college teaching as 
"news from the graveyard," and develops 
into a wild-eyed socialist, bent only upon the 
upsetting of the comfortable order of society, 
and seeing in the harbor only a vast capital- 
istic engine for the crushing of human lives. 
There is nothing constructive about Kramer's 
ideals, but only a fierce conviction that any- 
thing would be better than the existing state 
of affairs, and an absolute inability to partici- 
pate in Dillon's vision of social amelioration 
through enhanced efficiency and the applica- 
tion of directive intelligence to industrial 
affairs. The hero, whose part in the drama is 
that of a professional writer for newspapers 
and magazines, gradually finds doubts creep- 
ing into his mind, and becomes more and more 
swayed by sympathy with Kramer's material- 
istic aims and aspirations. To our mind there 
is no doubt as to the ascendancy and ultimate 
triumph of Dillon 's ideals, because they mean 
the victory of intellectualism over emotional- 
ism in human affairs, and it is something of a 
disappointment that the hero should come to 
waver between the two views. When we take 
leave of him, he is struggling with a confused 
sense that there is something big and unappre- 
hended in the cause of which Kramer has been 
the protagonist, and for which, as the ring- 
leader of a riot of striking dockers, he has very 
nearly forfeited his life to the law. The char- 
acterization in the novel is fine, although the 
two women (the hero's wife and sister) do not 
quite take hold of our sympathies as we wish 
they might ; but the hero, his father, and the 
two men who most influence him, are genuine 
creations. In style and temper, this book re- 
minds us strongly of the two novels of Mr. 
Albert Edwards, to say nothing of its being 
concerned with the same sort of subject- 
matter. 

Turning from this vivid piece of modern 
realism to Mr. James Lane Allen's "The 
Sword of Youth," we are plunged into the 
very different atmosphere of sentimental ro- 
mance, tinged with psychological subtlety, and

delighting in word-painting for its own sake. 
The story is of the slightest, but, considering 
the nature of some of Mr. Allen's recent per- 
formances, we may be glad that the book he 
now gives us has any story at all. Here is an 
episode of the Civil War, the story of a Ken- 
tucky boy who, on his seventeenth birthday, 
determines to join the Confederate cause for 
which his father and four brothers have al- 
ready sacrificed their lives. To do this, he 
must forsake his sweetheart, and leave his 
mother to struggle alone with the difficulties 
of an impoverished farm. Two years then 
elapse, and the boy, now a veteran soldier, is 
with the Army of Northern Virginia, the for- 
lorn last hope of the Confederacy, on the eve 
of the fall of Kichmond and the end of all 
things. A letter gets through to him with the 
information that his mother is dying, and an 
appeal to come to her before it is too late. He 
at once deserts, and reaches his Kentucky 
home only to find that it is too late. Then he 
goes back to Lee's camp, makes his confession, 
and is pardoned. The end of the tale leaves 
him in the arms of his betrothed. This is all 
of the story ; it is eked out to novelistic volume 
by what we should call padding were it not 
the writing of so artistic a stylist and sugges- 
tive an intelligence as those of Mr. Allen. A 
minor but irritating inaccuracy is the spelling 
11 Clarke" for the name of the explorer; a 
more serious lapse is the implication that 
slavery no longer existed in Kentucky in the 
autumn of 1863. Of course, the Declaration 
had no application to the slave states that re- 
mained in the Union, and it was not until the 
adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment that 
the Kentucky slaves were legally emancipated. 
Miss Clothilde Graves, who writes under the 
pen-name of "Richard Dehan," has added to 
"The Dop Doctor" and "Between Two 
Thieves," a third novel of similar dimensions. 
"The Man of Iron," with Bismarck for its 
central figure, treats of the Franco-Prussian 
War with the methods employed by "Between 
Two Thieves" for the Crimean War. The 
book has taken over two years to write (as well 
it might!), according to the preface, which 
thus magniloquently states this simple fact: 
"For the second time, since this book's begin- 
ning, the rose of June had flamed into splen- 
did bloom. I drew breath, for my task 
approached its ending, and looked up from the 
yellowed newspaper records of a great War 
waged forty-four years ago." What she saw 
the world knows only too well. But, beholding 

it, she further says : 

" I see no cause to blot. a line that I have written. 
For the Germany of 1870 was not the Germany 
of 1914. The New Spirit of Teutonism had not 



shown itself in those dead days I have tried to 
testify. . . . Could the relentless exponent of 
the fierce gospel of blood and iron have foreseen 
the imminent, approaching disintegration of his 
colossal life-work, under the hands of his suc- 
cessors could he have known what Dead Sea 
fruit of ashes and bitterness his fatal creed, 
grafted upon the oak of Germany, was fated to 
bring forth he would have drunk ere death of 
the crimson lees of the Cup of Judgment; he 
would have seen in the shape of his pupil the gro- 
tesque, distorted image of himself." 

Both this prophecy and this psychological 
judgment are probably true; and, although 
the author claims to have blotted no line of 
her story in the light of recent happenings, 
we may venture to assert that the last words 
of the heroine to the Iron Chancellor have 
been penned since the fatal first of August 
of last year. 

" You are not a good man, Monseigneur . . . 
Hard, subtle, arrogant, cruel, and unscrupulous, 
God made you to be the Fate of France. One day 
she will lift up her face from the mire into which 
you have trodden it, and the star will be burning 
unquenched upon her forehead. We may both he 
dead before that day dawns. But rest assured 
that when your armies cross the Rhine they will 
not gain an easy victory! We shall be prepared 
and ready, Monseigneur, when the Germans come 
again !" 

These words come at the very close, when the 
heroine, after having cherished the ambition 
to become a second Charlotte Corday, has 
heeded the scriptural injunction "Ven- 
geance is mine; I will repay" and has been 
stirred by compassion to save Bismarck's life 
instead of destroying it, takes her leave of the 
sinister Man of Iron. The heroine is a French 
girl, noble and pure-souled, the daughter of a 
French officer slain on the battle-field, and of 
a wicked mother, who has trafficked in both 
personal and patriotic honor, and who has 
even sought to drag her own child into the 
maelstrom of corruption. The mother has just 
met a richly-merited fate, and the daughter is 
on the way to England with the young Irish 
journalist who has been her faithful lover 
from the time when he first saw her, and to 
whom she has given her heart in gladness. 
This Irishman, P. C. Breagh by name, is the 
hero of the story on its private and romantic 
side, and plays his part acceptably to the 
reader, if not much more than that. He is a 
free-lance war correspondent, driven into that 
calling by the accident of having been swin- 
dled out of his inheritance by a rascally trus- 
tee. To make smooth his future, we are given 
to understand that the inheritance is eventu- 
ally to be recovered. On the historical side, 
the novel gives us vital characterizations of 
Bismarck and Moltke, of the pathetic Prince

Imperial and of his tinsel emperor-father con- 
cerning whom these burning words are writ- 
ten : ' ' He had made France his mistress and 
his slave, and now her fetters were to be 
hacked apart by the merciless sword of the 
invader. Through losses, privations, and hu- 
miliations; through an ordeal of suffering 
unparalleled in the world's history, through 
an orgy of vice and an era of infidelity, 
through fresh oceans of blood shed from the 
veins of her bravest, she was to pass before she 
found herself and God again." This concep- 
tion of the Terrible Year as a divine judgment 
upon a beloved but sinning nation is the key- 
note of the work, which is infused throughout 
(we need hardly say) by the deepest of relig- 
ious feeling. Its war pictures are vivid tran- 
scripts of reality, its human figures have the 
stamp of life upon them, and its decorative 
features are the embodiment of minute and 
comprehensive knowledge. It is all over- 
wrought, and this lack of restraint in both 
style and feeling is its chief defect. We think 
it somewhat less impressive than "Between 
Two Thieves," but we would not willingly 
have missed reading it.

microscope have marvellously 
enhanced man's knowledge of, and his mas- 
tery over, the forces of nature, enlarged his 
understanding of his own structure and func- 
tions, and filled his quiver with new weapons 
against foes seen and unseen. Nature is no 
longer a sealed book, and superstitious fear 
of her has forever been banished by men. In- 
deed, he scans the creeping caterpillar and 
turns it at will by his knowledge of its reac- 
tions to stimuli, and straightway proclaims 
mechanism as the all-sufficient and complete 
explanation of the mystery of life. Those who 
find the mechanistic conception of life satisfy- 
ing, as well as those who question the adequacy 
of its foundations and conclusions, will find in 
Professor J. Arthur Thomson's "The Wonder 
of Life" (Holt) much food for rumination. 
It is a series of glimpses into the structures, 
functions, activities, habits, and instincts 
which characterize living things, and distin- 
guish them from the non-living world which 
does not trade with time and transmit its gains 
to its descendants. This is admirably shown 
hy the marvellous story of the fresh-water eel 
which migrates from the Vistula to the deep 
ea off Ireland for the purpose of spawning, 
and by the unique transformation of its trans- 



parent ribbon-like larvae into the still smaller 
black elvers which make their way back by 
some secret homing instinct from the open sea 
to the streams and lakes of the centre of the 
continent. To the mechanist this is no more 
than the intricate unravelment of chemical 
reaction, provided only he endows the fleeting 
and ever-changing molecules of the eel, as they 
come into and then forever leave its changing 
body, with all the fundamental properties that 
the race of eels have accumulated in the ages 
of their long evolution. Professor Thomson 
is a Neo-vitalist of an undogmatic sort, and he 
has set forth an inviting array of problems for 
his many materialistic confreres to consider. 
Anything from his pen is sure to be interest- 
ing, to be marked by lucidity, by a spirit of 
candor, and by a clearly defined progress to 
definite conclusions, or at least to a clear state- 
ment of the problem. Although deeply im- 
bued with the philosophic significance of the 
fact related, the work is not written in the 
philosophic tone nor does it employ the phil- 
osophic vocabulary. It is a charming series of 
natural history word pictures, painted for the 
most part in newly explored lands, and 
sketched with a trained hand. These countless 
illustrations of life's wonders are grouped 
about seven main themes: the drama of life 
with its primal impulses of hunger and love; 
the haunts of life, or the story of exploitation 
of the earth to its remotest nooks and corners ; 
the insurgence of life, or the circumvention of 
space and the conquest of time by produc- 
tivity, by adaptation to difficult conditions, by 
tenacity and plasticity, and by the mysterious 
instinct of migration that guides the inexpe- 
rienced fledgling across trackless wastes of 
land and sea. Behavior of animals, or the 
ways of life, are illustrated by the complex 
instincts of birds and insects, and the web of 
life by the intricate interrelations of flowers 
and insects, of parasites and their hosts, by 
the story of pearls, and by the complex adapta- 
tions of the cuckoo, who foists her domestic 
cares upon other birds. The cycle of life is 
illustrated by the various types of develop- 
ment under normal and experimental condi- 
tions, and includes a discussion of parental 
instincts, and of death. The closing chapter, 
on the wonder of life, is one of unusual inter- 
est which sums up and elaborates the distin- 
guishing characteristics of organisms. It 
ranges over a great variety of topics, from 
anaphallaxis and chemical individuality to 
sleep and phosphorescence, protective colora- 
tion, mimicry, and transmission of acquired 
characters, and closes with an illuminating, if 
not wholly conclusive, discussion of vitalism 
as opposed to mechanism.

This is an elementary book, 

The atom of ,, T r T> \J L 

the French says Mr. H. P. Adams in the 
preface to his brief sketch of the 
French Revolution (McClurg). " It aims, 
above all, at making the story clear. Its other 
purpose, no less important, is to indicate the 
present state of the chief problems associated 
with the great Revolution." A book which 
should really do what Mr. Adams aims to do, 
within the space which he has allowed him- 
self, would be a notable event; it would be 
such a book as might be written by a man 
possessed of the learning of Aulard, the in- 
sight of Carlyle, and the constructive and 
literary talent of, let us say, Mignet. In lieu 
of first-hand knowledge, Mr. Adams has read 
"Acton, Sorel, Aulard, Kropotkin, Belloc, and 
the writers of the Cambridge Modern His- 
tory." These are all very well in their \vay, 
but they are so little agreed in their concep- 
tions of the Revolution that however intelli- 
gently one may read them (and Mr. Adams 
appears to have read them attentively enough) 
a sketch of the subject "based mainly" on 
them is almost sure to lack precisely that merit 
which Mr. Adams seeks to attain, namely, 
clearness. Certainly one must have not only a 
pretty good first-hand knowledge of the Revo- 
lution, but a considerable appreciation of the 
influences that have given us such varied inter- 
pretations of it, before it is possible to recon- 
cile Aulard, Kropotkin, and the "writers of 
the Cambridge Modern History." To two 
parts of Kropotkin, Mr. Adams has apparently 
added one part of Aulard and one of what col- 
lege students know best as ' ' Mr. Cambridge. ' ' 
The mixture has been well stirred, and spiced 
with certain generalizations of the author's 
own brewing. But the trouble is that the 
ingredients do not combine, and the result is 
far from clear. Fortunately, it is no crime to 
write an unsatisfactory book about the French 
Revolution ; and if ' ' the readers for whom 
[the book] is intended" are such as like to 
read about the Revolution without going be- 
yond text books and brief manuals, they will 
find here, as the author expresses a hope that 
they may, "something essentially differing 
from what they can get from the excellent 
hand books of similar size that exist. ' ' 



The late John Hays Gardiner's 
Jd ement v lume on Harvard in the 

"American Colleges and Uni- 
versities Series" (Oxford Press) is not a con- 
ventional history ; it is an impressive account 
of the institution that was practically created 
by President Eliot during the forty years of 
his administration. Some of the items that 
stick in memory after the book has been read 



are: Germany's major part in the develop- 
ment of Harvard, the way the college attends 
to the intimate needs of its students, the illus- 
trious names that have been connected with it, 
and the inimitableness of its collections. 
There could not be a more inspiring chapter 
in American education than the one in this 
book treating the origin, development, and 
present status of Harvard's libraries. And 
the story of the other collections (including 
that of the glass flowers) does not lag in sug- 
gestiveness. It is good for the soul to read of 
the equipment for research with which Har- 
vard is endowed. The social life of the stu- 
dents, as it revolves around athletics and 
clubs, is set forth in a most enlightening way. 
There is nothing apologetic or patronizing in 
this connection ; the physical activities seem 
to prevent dyspepsia and the social ones offish- 
ness, so that all are pleased. The fact that 
from one-half to two-thirds of the students 
work their way, partly at least, through Har- 
vard is viewed optimistically. Could not the 
impecunious do a little far-sighted borrow- 
ing while in college? The time is at most 
short, and during this brief space Sauls are 
supposed to be metamorphosed into Pauls. 
But students have a way the country over of 
answering this and similar questions to their 
own apparent satisfaction, and it is their 
affair. If the author of this book thinks that 
students at Harvard act wisely, the reader is 
almost forced to agree, for he sees that Har- 
vard did well by him. The volume was writ- 
ten with care and love. It contains a great 
mass of detailed information presented in the 
orthodox Harvard tone: dignified, measured, 
truth-bearing, unhumorous. Arranged as the 
chapters are, there is an occasional repetition ; 
the traditional Harvard use of the fine-tooth 
comb as a searching instrument occurs (it 
reminds one too much of Murillo) ; and there 
is at least one slip : on page 19 Harvard Hall 
is said to have burned down on February 2, 
1764, while on page 237 the same disaster is 
reported to have taken place on January 24, 
1764. But these are trivialities which the 
author would indubitably have attended to 
had he lived to revise his manuscript. All in 
all, this is at once an inspiring and an instruc- 
tive account of the way in which America's 
best-known university makes men out of boys 
and scholars out of men.

and being also Professor of Surgery in the 
University of Buffalo and Surgeon-in- Chief to 
the Buffalo General Hospital, as well as an 
acknowledged leader in his profession, he was 
naturally called upon to minister to the dis- 
tinguished visitor. His absence from the city, 
however, made it necessary that another hand 
should perform the immediate operation de- 
manded by the exigencies of the case. His 
subsequent endeavors to save the patient's life 
and his disappointment and distress at failure 
are matters of history. It is to his pen that we 
owe the " Selected Papers, Surgical and Scien- 
tific," chosen for publication by two of his 
colleagues, and issued to subscribers. One of 
these colleagues, Dr. Charles G. Stockton, has 
prepared a memoir of Dr. Park, with which 
the volume opens, and the surgeon 's son Julian 
contributes a brief preface and otherwise coop- 
erates in the editorship of the volume. From 
papers on cancer, a subject of special study, to 
an inquiry into the ultimate substance or 
force composing the universe, the writer 
shows a wide range of interests and attain- 
ments; and the clearness and simplicity with 
which, even to a layman, he succeeds in con- 
veying his meaning render his writings attrac- 
tive beyond the circle of those to whom most of 
them are primarily addressed. The picture of 
the man himself, in Dr. Stockton's memoir, 
is by no means the least interesting feature of 
the volume. A portrait of a more literal sort 
than this literary one faces the title-page. 



England in 
the later 
Middle Ages. 



Macaulay found but one fault in 
his favorite Thucydides, a too 
close adherence to narrative. 
Since Macaulay 's day experiments in histori- 
cal writing have been tried in which the con- 
secutive statement of particular events has 
been broken for purposes of exposition, or 
philosophy, or what not. For the serious stu- 
dent of history such an excursus, breaking the 
narrative, is less enlightening than might be 
expected. "England in the Later Middle 
Ages," by Professor Kenneth H. Vickers, of 
the University of Durham, has been criticized 
as lacking in such "philosophical" passages. 
From this criticism we dissent; there was a 
noticeable need of a book covering the period 
from 1272 to 1485 in narrative form, and ad- 
hering as closely as possible to the sources. 
Such a book the third volume of "A History 
of England" (Putnam) in seven volumes un- 
der the general editorship of Professor Oman 
turns out to be. Sources only recently avail- 
able are referred to constantly. It is no easy 
matter to satisfy the specialist and the gen- 
eral reader in the treatment of these two cen- 
turies; in the adoption of his style Professor 



Vickers has had the specialist as well as the 
reader in mind. Certainly the decorations of 
history, dramatic and picturesque details, he 
has employed with economy. One may read 
well into the narrative of Agincourt without 
realizing it; but one is bound to admit that 
the casual account is probably better history 
than eloquence or dramatic writing after the 
event. Nil admirari and personal detachment 
mark the book; and if few will sit down to 
read the work through, leisure permitting, 
others will find themselves coming back to it 
for what is, on the whole, the best narrative of 
the period yet put together from confused and 
often contradictory masses of record. Par- 
ticularly to be commended are the maps of 
campaigns at the end of the volume. 



America's 
foremost 
art museum. 



In form and appearance befit- 
ting its subject, "A History of 
the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art" (Duffield), by Miss Winifred E. Howe, 
presents in considerable detail, and with a 
preliminary chapter on the early art institu- 
tions of New York, a chronological account of 
the now splendid collection started nearly half 
a century ago through the activity of a group 
of New York art-lovers, notably enriched some 
decades later by the discriminating generosity 
of the late J. Pierpont Morgan, fourth presi- 
dent of the Museum and most zealous and 
intelligent promoter of its fortunes, and, since 
1910, under the able directorship of Mr. 
Edward Robinson, in succession to Sir Caspar 
Purdon Clarke. A preface of more than a 
perfunctory character is contributed by Mr. 
Robert W. De Forest, who for more than a 
quarter of a century has been a trustee of the 
Museum and has served it in various capaci- 
ties. The preliminary account of the city's 
early institutions of art is a notable contribu- 
tion to local history, filling a third of the 
volume. Prepared before the publication of 
the recent biography of Samuel F. B. Morse, 
first president of the National Academy of 
Design and otherwise prominent in New 
York's early endeavors to become an art 
centre, the chapter could not avail itself of the 
considerable relevant material that excellent 
biography contains; but it appears to be a 
thorough and trustworthy piece of work 
within the limits of its design. Many por- 
traits and other illustrations suitably enrich 
the volume. 

war and ^ n "War an< ^ Insurance" (Mac-

affairs. The dyadic relations of man to man he 
considers unstable and fraught with danger:

THE DIAL 



[March 18 



"A pair of men is what I may call an essen- 
tially dangerous community. " He sp eaks of it 
as a law that this dual relation produces fric- 
tion, and that this friction tends to increase; 
and goes on to say that the deepest reason why 
war is so persistent is that nations, thus far in 
history, are related chiefly in pairs. This would 
be altered by triads, which, like the normal 
family father, mother, and child, consist 
of a group of three parties. In the family 
triad, the winning and common care for the 
child may charm away many of the influences 
that threaten to wreck the unity of the home. 
Similarly in any triadic group the interme- 
diary, corresponding to the child in the fam- 
ily, transforms the dangerous pair into a 
harmonious triad, and gives stability and 
peace. Such a group of three Professor 
Royce calls a ' ' community of interpretation. ' ' 
Besides the family we have such communities 
of interpretation in the judicial triad (com- 
plainant, defendant, judge) , the banking triad 
(investor, borrower, banker), and the insur- 
ance triad (adventurer, beneficiary, insurer). 
Of all relations and practical communities yet 
devised, the insurance relations and communi- 
ties most tend to bring peace on earth. No 
adequate effort has been made to further 
peace through an application of the insurer's 
community to international business. This 
Professor Royce advocates, and he believes, 
notwithstanding the difficulties discussed in 
his introduction, that the proposal is practical.

How well French scholarship

might teach America to unite 

^ pQwer Q learning with the 

forces of daily life has often enough been 
shown; yet seldom more clearly than when 
M. Joseph Bedier, now foremost among au- 
thorities on the mediaeval romances, con- 
structed from several versions a story of 
Tristan and Iseult which is essentially faithful 
to tradition, and yet suited to the demands of 
modern taste, and to the likings of the modern 
reader. Le Roman de Tristan et Iseut, as 
adapted by this eminent scholar, having been 
crowned by the French Academy, has since 
attracted the services of skilful translators, 
one of them Mr. Hilaire Belloc, whose version 
is published in this country by Messrs. Dodd, 
Mead & Co. The English translation has in 
some quarters been even more highly praised 
in point of style than M. Bedier 's adaptation, 
though his skill in French is great. If the 
praise be too high, it nevertheless serves as a 
vigorous recommendation of a fascinating 
book. May the volume come into the hands 
of everyone who knows the tale of Tristan 
only through the medium of Wagner ! 






In ' ' The English Parish 
iaeval church Church" (Scribner) Mr. J. 

Charles Cox has written, out of 
fulness of knowledge, an admirable brief 
manual for the amateur. It is, as the sub- 
title proclaims, "an account of the chief 
building types and their materials during nine 
centuries," broadly considering the church 
fabric as a whole rather than individual 
forms of detail. It is in this respect that it 
contrasts with the more minute treatments of 
Mr. Bond, whereas it supplements Mr. Cram's 
portfolio of views through its enlightening 
text. Especially vital is the chapter on the 
gradual growth of church plans. The illus- 
trations, though small, are many and unhack- 
neyed, selected with a knowledge of the 
buildings and of the literature which is aston- 
ishingly wide. It is the parish church rather 
than the cathedral which is the flower of En- 
glish mediaeval church architecture. To the 
tourist and the student this little volume will 
prove an excellent guide. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The "Useful Reference Series" published by 
the Boston Book Company has two unquestionably 
useful recent additions in Mr. Axel Moth's 
" Glossary of Library Terms : English, Danish, 
Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Swed- 
ish," and Miss Katharine H. Wead's "List of 
Series and Sequels for Juvenile Readers." These 
are in pamphlet form and constitute numbers ten 
and eleven, respectively, of the series. 

Technicalities remote and obscure, slang expres- 
sions, archaic terms, and unusual phrases of all 
sorts are contained in the index to Mr. Ralph 
Durand's "Handbook to the Poetry of Rudyard 
Kipling" (Doubleday). The index alone should 
convince anyone that a Kipling handbook satisfies 
a real need. The book itself further justifies the 
assumption. It is more than a mere glossary of 
terms: it is brimful of information about the 
unheard-of things with which Mr. Kipling whets 
the curiosity of his readers just the information, 
in fact, that every Kipling enthusiast wants. 

The well-known Stedman-Woodberry edition of 
the Works of Edgar Allan Poe, first published in 
1895 in ten volumes, is now re-issued by Messrs. 
Scribner in their "Library of Modern Authors." 
It has been reset in larger type and printed from 
new plates on paper bearing the author's initials 
in water-mark ; the bibliography has been brought 
down to date, the matter pertaining to the por- 
traits rearranged, and the text, re-examined by 
Professor Woodberry, has been revised in the few 
immaterial points where it has been found wanting. 
The scholarly critical notes, subjected to the same 
careful re-examination, have been retained. Ex- 
cellent in every detail of book manufacture, this 
becomes without question the definitive edition of 
Poe.

ker gives intimate accounts of the fundamental 
features of New York as seen by artist and critic. 

In "James Russell Lowell as a Critic," which 
Messrs. Putnam will publish immediately, Mr. 
Joseph J. Reilly raises the question whether or not 
Lowell can be called a critic and answers it in the 
negative. 

Augustus Be Morgan's " Budget of Paradoxes " 
has been edited and revised by Mr. Bavid Eugene 
Smith and is announced for spring publication in 
two large octavo volumes by the Open Court Pub- 
lishing Co. 

Among the March novels announced by Messrs. 
Scribner are Mr. Maurice Hewlett's "A Lover's 
Tale," Mr. Gouverneur Morris's " The Seven Bar- 
lings," and "August First," by Mrs. Mary Ray- 
mond Shipman Andrews and Mr. Roy Irving 
Murray. 

Buring the spring two new volumes will be added 
to the " National Social Science Series," which 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. are publishing. They 
are " The Cost of Living," by Mr. Walter E. Clark, 
and " Trusts and Competition," by Mr. John F. 
Crowell. 

Br. William Healy Ball has prepared a biog- 
raphy of one of America's most prominent nat- 
uralists, Spencer Fullerton Baird, which will also 
contain selections from his correspondence with 
Audubon, Agassiz, Bana, and others. Messrs. J. B. 
Lippincott Co. are the publishers. 



When M. Berger's Life of William Blake ap- 
peared in France several years ago, Swinburne 
hastened to acclaim it as the " last word " on the 
poet and mystic. The work has now been trans- 
lated into English and will be published this 
month by Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. 

Professor Joseph Jastrow's studies in experi- 
mental and comparative psychology, embodying his 
findings on the development of the individual and 
social nature, will appear this spring under the 
title of " Character and Temperament," with the 
imprint of Messrs. B. Appleton & Co. 

" Hellenic Civilization," by Br. G. W. Botsford 
and Br. E. G. Sihler, is the first volume of a new 
series of sources and studies covering the entire 
history of western civilization. The series will be 
entitled " Records of Civilization," and will be 
issued by the Columbia University Press. 

In " The Modern Study of Literature," which 
will come from the University of Chicago Press, 
the author, Br. Richard Green Moulton, offers an 
introduction to literary theory and interpretation, 
aiming to show how literature may maintain its 
place in the foremost ranks of modern study. 

Buring the spring two volumes of plays will be 
added to Mr. Mitchell Kennerley's " Modern 
Brama Series." They are " The Lonely Way : 
Interlude: Countess Mizzi," from the German of 
Arthur Schnitzler, and " Lovers : The Free 
Woman: They," from the French of Maurice 
Bonnay. 

An English version is soon to be published of 
one of Maeterlinck's earlier and less familiar 
works, " Serres Chaudes." The poems have been 
translated in their original metres by Mr. Bernard 
Miall, who has also contributed a preface on their 
place in contemporary letters in Maeterlinck's own 
literary career. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett is at work on the com- 
pleting volume of the trilogy which he began in 
1910 with " Clayhanger," and continued in 1911 
with " Hilda Lessways " ; and he hopes to publish 
it next autumn. Meantime his English publishers 
are bringing out a new edition of his romance of 
the divorce problem, " Whom God Hath Joined " 
originally published in 1906. 

The publishing business of Messrs. Browne & 
Howell Co., Chicago, has been taken over by Mr. 
Frank L. Howell, long associated with the old com- 
pany, and will be conducted under the name of The 
Howell Co. (not inc.), with general offices at 608 
South Bearborn St., Chicago. It will be the aim of 
the new company to maintain the high standard of 
publishing set by the older concern. New publica- 
tions for the spring will shortly be announced. 

Two books of special interest to come from the 
Oxford University Press are " Mark Rutherford's " 
"Last Pages from a Journal," which has been 
prepared for the press by Mrs. Hale White, and 
the late Mr. W. P. Courtney's " Bibliography of 
Samuel Johnson." Mr. Courtney spent an im- 
mense amount of labor on this task, which he did 
not live to finish, but his manuscript has had the 
benefit of revision at the hands of Mr. B. Nicol 
Smith.

THE DIAL 



[ March 18 



" Writers of the Day " is a new series announced 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. the aim of which is 
to present brief yet comprehensive estimates of au- 
thors while they are yet alive. To the first group 
of titles now in preparation belong Mr. J. D. 
Beresford's " H. G. Wells," Mr. Hugh Walpole's 
" Joseph Conrad," Mr. W. L. George's "Anatole 
France," Miss Sheila Kaye-Smith's " John Gals- 
worthy," and Mr. Stephen Gwynn's " Mrs. 
Humphry Ward." 

The forthcoming translation of Treitschke's 
" History of Germany in the Nineteenth Century " 
recently announced in these columns is the joint 
undertaking of Messrs. McBride, Nast & Co. of 
New York and Messrs. Jarrold & Sons of London. 
The translator is Dr. M. E. Paul, and the editor 
is Mr. William H. Dawson, author of " The Evo- 
lution of Modern Germany." Mr. Dawson will 
write the supplementary volume of the series, 
which is to be issued in seven volumes. 

The posthumous book by the late Sister Nivedita, 
which Messrs. Longmans will have ready imme- 
diately under the title of " Footfalls of Indian His- 
tory," deals with the re-interpretation of the great 
ages of the past of India, especially in relation to 
the social and religious consciousness of the people. 
It will be illustrated in color from water-colors 
by Abanindra Nath Tagore, and two other members 
of the School of Indian Painters which has grown 
up under his inspiration at Calcutta. 

Russian literature figures prominently in the 
spring announcements of English publishers. We 
note in particular a new edition of Gogol's " Dead 
Souls," with a preface by Mr. Stephen Graham. 
Another of the great Russian realist novels, " The 
Golovleffs," by Shchedrin (Saltikov), is to appear 
for the first time in an English translation. Other 
announcements include a translation by J. E. 
Hogarth of Andreiev's play, " The Life of Man," 
which enjoyed a long run at the Arts Theatre in 
Moscow. 

The next batch of volumes to appear in Messrs. 
Holt's " Home University Library " will comprise 
a study of Milton, by Mr. John Bailey, whose 
" Johnson and his Circle " is already among the 
most successful volumes in the library ; a " History 
of Philosophy," by Mr. Clement C. J. Webb; 
" Political Thought in England, from Herbert 
Spencer to the Present Day," by Mr. Ernest 
Barker; and "Belgium," by Mr. R. C. K. Ensor, 
who deals with his subject both from the historical 
and the descriptive standpoint, with maps illus- 
trating past and present campaigns. 

Short and carefully-considered lists of note- 
worthy books in various departments of literature 
are compiled and issued at short intervals by the 
New York Public Library, the works named being 
selected from its own resources. For instance, 
there have lately appeared little paper book bibli- 
ographies of " Stories of Romance and Imagina- 
tion," "Stories of the Sea" (romance and fact), 
" Plays of Thirteen Countries." " Favorite Stories 
of the Library Reading Clubs," and, finally, of 
books dealing mostly with real life, but " as inter- 
esting as a novel," which much-used phrase is 
utilized as title. 



"A History of Travel in America," by Mr. 
Seymour Dunbar, is announced for immediate 
publication by Messrs. Bobbs-Merrill Co. It is 
primarily a story of pioneer conditions, the story 
of the wilderness road, prairie schooner, dog-sled, 
and pack-train; but it is more than that, for in 
tracing the development of travel to the highly 
organized railway systems of to-day it becomes a 
study of the nation's social and economic evolu- 
tion involved in the process. To the large mass of 
detailed information are added numerous photo- 
graphic reproductions of rare early prints, broad- 
sides, and obscure documents and manuscripts. The 
work will comprise four large volumes. 

New light is thrown on the business world of 
early Babylonia in a book about to be published 
in the " Columbia University Oriental Studies," 
entitled " Sumerian Records from Drehem," by Dr. 
W. M. Nesbit. The work contains a collection of 
inscribed clay tablets recovered from Drehem, near 
the city of Nippur, where expeditions from the 
University of Pennsylvania have carried on exca- 
vations since 1888. These particular tablets, how- 
ever, with others, were discovered at Drehem by 
Arabs and surreptitiously removed before the 
Turkish authorities could claim them for the 
Constantinople Museum. They were afterwards dis- 
tributed among various private collectors, the col- 
lection now dealt with being eventually secured for 
Dr. Nesbit by Professor Gottheil, of Columbia Uni- 
versity. 

Dr. Georg Brandes has finished his great biog- 
raphy of Goethe, and the work is announced for 
publication this spring. It is now nearly thirty 
years since the Danish critic gave his first series of 
lectures on Goethe, so that the coming biography 
will contain the results of a study that has lasted 
almost for a generation. In an interview, Dr. 
Brandes stated that his book has been written from 
a European rather than a German point of view, 
and that its plan differs as much from all existing 
biographies of Goethe as Goethe's own system of 
botany does from that of Linnaeus. He does not 
expect that his book will be well received in Ger- 
many, and he is afraid that the bitterness caused 
by the war will prevent it from having any great 
success in England or France. He has hopes, how- 
ever, that it will find readers in America. 

" I have often thought," says a writer in the 
London " Nation," " that an interesting parallel 
could be drawn between contemporary Belgian lit- 
erature and that of Ireland. Both owe a good deal 
to a more or less self-conscious movement started 
by a few men in the 'eighties and 'nineties of the 
last century. In both cases there are the two 
languages, each modifying and influencing the 
literature produced in the other, and if neither 
Irish nor Flemish has produced a writer who can 
compel attention, the Belgian writers of French 
and the Irish writers of English are deeply in- 
debted to the other tongue. And against the 
realist, and sometimes brutal, Camille Lemonnier. 
Ireland can place Mr. George Moore, while the 
weight of critical opinion would undoubtedly class 
M. Verhaeren and Mr. W. B. Yeats as the two 
greatest living poets."

The first book published here or in Europe on 
Austria-Hungary and the war. 

LUDWIG'S 

AUSTRIA-HUNGARY 
AND THE WAR 

By ERNEST LUDWIG, 

I. & R. Consul for Austria-Hungary, in Cleveland, Ohio, 

with preface by his excellency 

DR. KONSTANTIN THEODOR DUMBA, 

Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to the United States. 

It gives detailed particulars of the Sarajevo trial in which 
the assassination of the Crown Prince and his consort is 
proved to have been committed by members of the notorious 
"Narodna Odbrana" society of Servia, with the guilty fore- 
knowledge and complicity of the Servian government and 
tells why Servia's equivocal note regarding this was not 
acceptable, making necessary the declaration of war against 
Servia which brought on the present European conflict. 

" Mr. Ludwig's account of the intricacies, the duplicities, 
the irreconcilable interests of near-Eastern politics is as clear 
as it is circumstantial. He offers the best defense yet made 
of Austria-Hungary's note to Servia, by quoting a precedent. 
. . . A most informing book, written with a laudable 
moderation." New York Tribune. 

"A book of unusual value, giving, as it does, a side from 
which, since the conflict was begun, little has been heard." 
Indianapolis News. 

All royalties from the sale of this book have been do- 
nated to the Austro-Hungarian and German Widows and 
Orphans Funds.

Harvard Economic Books 

ESSAYS IN SOCIAL JUSTICE. 

By THOMAS NIXON CARVER, Ph.D., L.L.D., David A. 
Wells Professor of Political Economy in Harvard Uni- 
versity. 8vo. Cloth. 430 pages. $2.00 net. 
An attempt to define the principles of human conflict 
and social justice from the point of view of economic com- 
petition. It seeks to answer two questions. What ought 
the State to do with respect to the various conflicts in 
human interest? and How ought it to do it? This it seeks 
to accomplish by reference to external economic fact, 
rather than by internal criterions, such as the "senti- 
mental morality" that has hitherto influenced thought. 

SOME ASPECTS OF THE TARIFF QUESTION. 

By FRANK WILLIAM TAUSSIG, Ph.D., L.L.B., Litt.D., 
Henry Lee Professor of Economics in Harvard University. 
8vo. Cloth. Maps and Charts. $2.00 net. 
Questions of principle in the tariff controversy are con- 
sidered by the leading historian of the American tariff. 
The discussion of such phases as the relation of duties, 
imports and prices, of protection, and of the theory of 
comparative cost, is followed by a detailed examination 
of industries which illustrate these problems the sugar, 
iron, steel and textile industries.

UNITED STATES. 

By ELIOT JONES, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Economics 
in the State University of Iowa. 8vo. Cloth. 261 
pages. $1.30 net. 

More than the usual complexity of the trust problem is 
involved in this history and study of the anthracite 
industry. The effect of railroad control upon prices, the 
legal problems raised by government suits, the rights and 
limitations of carriers, and public ownership of natural 
resources are among the subjects treated.

"A first-class American novel." New York Tribune. 
"A distinctive addition to the role of American authors." New York Times. 

BLUE BLOOD AND RED 

By GEOFFREY CORSON 

The New York Times further says: "A keen and interesting study of 
the interaction in an old American community (Staten Island) of the 
forces of aristocracy and democracy. Primarily it is a love story. The 
reader's interest will center around Neal and Patricia, with their 
ardent desires for the best and finest things of life. Because of them 
and the large tolerant understanding of life which the book shows, its 
fine literary quality, and the richness of its pages, which teem with wise 
and true and often humorous observations upon life and character/Blue 
Blood and Red' must be placed among the truly successful American 
novels of recent months."

A Story of the Great War 

LITTLE COMRADE 

By BURTON E. STEVENSON 

Author of "The Marathon Mystery," "The Mystery of the Boule Cabinet," etc. 

A tale of mystery, love and international intrigue set in the first weeks 
of the great war. 

A young American surgeon leaving the Congress of surgeons at Vienna 
finds himself caught in the net of suspicion incident to German mobil- 
ization. At the Belgian border the situation is as "ticklish" as can well 
be imagined. How his "little comrade" joins him and how they are 
caught in the maelstrom of the Belgian campaign furnishes the starting- 
point of a remarkably stirring story.

HILLSBORO PEOPLE 

By DOROTHY CANFIELD 

With occasional Vermont verse by SARAH N. CLEGHORN. A volume of stories of a Vermont village. 

Hillsboro has its traditions from Colonial times, and its tales of pio- 
neers and the Revolution. It had firm convictions during the Civil 
War and has them yet about the church, the school and taxes. In 
recent years it has come closer to the great world not only through 
the railroads, newspapers, summer boarders and automobiles, but 
more poignantly through the scattering of the home-grown young folks 
and the influx of the foreign-born.

concise, comprehensive form, a very practical work.

"The writer has personally enjoyed reading the works and con- 
gratulates you upon the thoroughness with which you have covered 
the subject." 

"Students, apprentices and novices who are interested in the 
different branches of bookbinding will find it a very simple matter 
to learn and perfect themselves from these volumes, full of illus- 
trated examples. The printer and librarian will find it valuable 
beyond their expectations." 

"They are thorough and lucidly-written text- books, which will 
benefit the more expert workmen as well as learners. * * * *

The Teaching Of History JAEGER by H. j. CHAYTOR 

For fifty years a teacher of history in the schools of Germany, the author explains the well-planned 
system of his country. Contrasted with the inferior methods of England and the United States, this 
system, by its superiority, warrants earnest study and emulation. Dr. Jaeger writes in an illuminating 
and unusually interesting way, describing the work, as it is carried on in the nine forms, or grades, by 
illustrations of the methods used in the German school. The book will prove of great value to teachers 
as a help in whatever systems they may be using. 12mo.

this his latest work. The origin of the song is suggested, and its development in all nations is studied; 
its power and mission are emphasized, while chapters are given to songs of war, love, sentiment, the sea, 
negro minstrelsy, and patriotism. Sacred songs receive generous space. A feature of special interest 
is the introduction of the songs used by the soldiers of the nations now at war, many of them, like 
"Tipperary," "Deutschland iiber alles, the Austrian, Servian, and others, being given in full. A list 
of the old familiar songs in English is added. Frontispiece. 12mo.

Six Weeks at the 'War By MILLICENT, DUCHESS OF SUTHERLAND 

Written in the midst of the destruction and terror attending the invasion of Belgium, this account 
gives a startlingly vivid picture of the conditions which prevailed and which now attend the war. The 
Duchess organized an ambulance corps of eight nurses and a surgeon, with herself as chief, to serve at 
Brussels. Going on to Namur, the party did its work during the siege and occupation, after which it 
was obliged to leave. The insight into conditions, characterizations of officers, stories of the soldiers, 
and descriptions of the results of battle form a narrative which, uncensored, has peculiar intensity and 
unusual value. Illustrated. 16mo.

IN all the annals of history it has been the powerful writ- 
ing of some man that has stirred the populace. Homer, 
Marc Antony, Peter the Hermit, Martin Luther and 
Zwingli, and, in later times, James Otis, Patrick Henry 
and Lincoln have all by their virile words moulded and 
directed the temperaments of great nations. 

General Friedrich von Bernhardi 

soldier, statesman and writer, now gives his first book since

MR. WELLS AND RECONSTRUCTION. 



Almost everybody had one experience at 
the outbreak of the war, for it gave a sudden 
check to many forms of thought and action. 
It seemed as if nothing were so theoretical or 
so remote as to be unaffected. In politics, 
business, philanthropy, even in education, 
philosophy, art, and many another form of 
interest, the war interposed a bar even to 
thought. People have not got over that feel- 
ing. There is a sort of indifference, such as 
comes of the continuance of anything which 
one cannot influence in any way. The daily 
work of life must be done, and it is better ta 
do it with undivided mind. Still it is not easy 
to get back to the old line of thought. There 
is a tendency to jump the gap, come to the 
end of the war, and begin anew. 

On this subject there are all sorts of ideas. 
Some people are most gloomy in their fore- 
bodings ; they predict an intolerable England 
or a predominant Pan-Slavism or an over- 
powering militarism, or even a new epoch of 
more tremendous wars. Others have a very 
different view: they see signs of a renais- 
sance of righteousness ; they believe that peo- 
ple will get together for a re-assertion of the 
spiritual in life; they feel that somehow 
civilization will draw good out of so great evil. 

No one has thought more on just this sub- 
ject than Mr. H. Gr. Wells. For twenty years 
he has been constantly turning over in his 
mind the question of world organization and 
re-organization. Whatever one's opinion of 
the value of his thoughts or of his ideas, there 
is no question as to the abundance of them. 
Mr. Henry James (who in some ways can 
hardly be supposed to admire Mr. Wells) 
thinks of him as showering his ideas upon 
mankind ''as from a high window ever open." 
Mr. Wells has sometimes dealt with just this 
question, as in ''The War in the Air," the 
more recent "The World Set Free," or even 
such a book as "In the Days of the Comet," 
in which we have reconstruction not after 
war, it is true, but after another form of 
cataclysm. Sometimes he has dealt with the 
general question of ideal society, as in "An- 
ticipations," "Mankind in the Making," "A 



248 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



Modern Utopia." Sometimes he has pre- 
sented not thought on this subject, but peo- 
ple thinking, as in "The New Macchiavelli " 
and other such novels. Of late he has pub- 
lished a good deal of particular consideration 
of the immediate future. 

With Mr. Wells 's past ideas of what war 
would be or his present ideas of how current 
circumstances may best be managed, we 
would not deal at the moment. As to the 
anticipations of the past, we need not sup- 
pose that they could have been exactly 
realized, for the present war occurs under 
circumstances very different from those 
which Mr. Wells postulated. As to his ideas 
about the present crisis, we may suppose that 
Mr. Wells has opportunities very different 
from ours, so that our criticism would not be 
illuminating. It may be interesting, how- 
ever, to say a word upon what seem to be 
Mr. Wells 's controlling ideas, as we see them, 
let us not say in all his books, but at least as 
they appear in one place or another, seeming 
to make on the whole rather a consistent sys- 
tem. Such main ideas have been before the 
public for a good while. 

Implicit in much of Mr. Wells 's thinking 
on this subject is the idea of a new temper, a 
new disposition, in mankind. We may not 
think this a very probable condition; in an 
earlier book, "In the Days of the Comet," 
the new disposition was the result of the Great 
Change caused by the nitrogenous gas dif- 
fused by the comet. After that people were 
different, and indeed as one read it seemed 
most natural that they should be different. 
In "The World Set Free" Mr. Wells relied 
on no such unlikely circumstance ; simply the 
war brought about such horrible destruction 
that existence itself was hardly possible for 
multitudes, and the new order of things made 
"an appeal to elements in the nature of man 
that had hitherto been suppressed." "The 
World Set Free" is said to have exhausted 
the reviewers' stock of adjectives. It was 
pronounced daring, stimulating, apocalyptic, 
masterly, and so on, as well as timely. All 
this it doubtless was and much more, among 
other things very plausible. And in nothing 
was it more plausible than in the way in which 
the world was seen to acquiesce in the assump- 
tion of authority by those who set themselves 
the task of reconstruction. The conference 
governed by right of being able to govern; 
it obviated interference by allowing any out- 



sider, who wanted to help, to do his share of 
the. work. And, government being a chance 
to work for those who could work instead of 
a chance to draw pay for those who had a 
"pull," affairs went better than nowadays. 

We may have our doubts as to such a plan ; 
but even so, it appears that Mr. Wells is 
basing this part of his plan upon a really 
existing disposition. When a number of 
prominent men in any city get together now- 
adays to consider some immediate question, 
such as unemployment at home or want 
abroad, everyone feels that it is the proper 
thing, and they carry through their plan with- 
out anyone wanting to interfere with them, 
because there is an obvious thing to be done 
and they can obviously do it. Mr. Wells 
develops this idea, common enough in every- 
one's experience, upon a large scale. 

With or without such a change in general 
disposition, the fundamental idea of Mr. 
Wells 's reconstruction is usually a world- 
order based upon scientific coordination and 
cooperation. "Science," said the abdicating 
King of Italy, in the book, "is the new king 
of the world. ... It is the mind of the race. ' ' 
As we see the process in "The World Set 
Free" the first tasks of the administration 
were, almost of necessity, scientific. Here 
was the population of the world in need of 
food and shelter. It was natural to go about 
relief in a scientific way; and if one begins 
scientifically why not go on? If it is best to 
have a world-planning committee, why not 
have city-planning committees? And if one 
is going to arrange the cities in the best pos- 
sible way, why not the houses, and so on ? 

Of course in the United States we have a 
general feeling against such universal man- 
agement. We are too near the frontiersman 
to be willing to do away with the all-around 
man', who can turn his mind to any problem, 
in favor of the specialist. But there is an- 
other objection suggested (in earlier works) 
by Mr. Wells himself, namely, the fact that 
extreme specialization would have its disad- 
vantages. In "When the Sleeper Wakes," a 
story of two hundred years ahead, we have 
two clearly distinguished classes, the workers 
and the players; in "The Time Machine" 
two hundred centuries or so ahead the division 
has become much more marked and we have 
two distinct species. That is Mr. Wells 's view 
of what our haphazard specialization will re- 
sult in . But in " The First Men in the Moon ' ' 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



249 



he shows us scientific system, and the result 
is worse. The Selenites were the definite re- 
sult of systematic selection : those who had 
to do physical work were all hands or all 
whatever they had to work Avith. So it was 
with mental work: one man could remember, 
one could solve problems. The Grand Lunar, 
their king, w r as (characteristically) all brain. 
This specialization seemed painful to the visi- 
tor from the earth ; though as Mr. Wells then 
remarked, it was really more humane to have 
people grow up into machines than to let them 
grow up into human beings and then make 
machines out of them. Still that last, of 
course, was only satire, better have them not 
machines at all. 

Another point about the scientific coopera- 
tion which makes such a figure in Mr. Wells 's 
system is its efficiency. Now efficiency is 
rather under a cloud at present, and people 
who look ahead are inclined to desire not a 
more efficient civilization but a more spiritual 
civilization. Mr. Wells 's civilization is spir- 
itual in some senses ; it is certainly not mate- 
rial or mechanical. In "A Modern Utopia" 
we have a civilization far less material than 
our own and far less bound by the ties of 
mechanical literalism. So also in the little 
picture at the end of "The World Set Free" 
of the life at the hospital ; indeed, Mr. Wells 
is always full of ideas which in the simple 
sense of being not material, not bound by 
legalism, are spiritual. If, however, we imply 
by "spiritual," as most people do, some rela- 
tion to a spirit not our own, then it is pretty 
clear that we are thinking of something out 
of Mr. Wells 's usual sphere. As one watches 
the unfolding of his ideal world one is struck 
more and more by the fact that it has nothing 
about it answering to the usual idea of relig- 
ion. It will be remembered that most of the 
men one hesitates to say heroes in Mr. 
Wells 's books are men who have parted from 
traditional religion and do not have any 
obvious substitute for it. In some cases Mr. 
Wells tells how this came about. Mr. Lew- 
isham, for instance, read his Butler's "Anal- 
ogy" and some other books, had doubts, and 
called upon God for ' ' Faith ' ' in the silence of 
the night, "Faith to be delivered immedi- 
ately if Mr. Lewisham's patronage was valued, 
and which nevertheless was not so deliv- 
ered." Mr. Lewisham was an early figure, 
but his followers had equally slight expe- 
riences, which is perhaps rather like life. 



One would not expect in Mr. Wells 's think- 
ing to find much consideration of traditional 
religion. We do, however, curiously enough, 
have something slightly of the sort: in "The 
World Set Free" is an interesting quotation 
from the general memorandum to teachers 
which was ' ' the keynote of the modern educa- 
tional system." It begins with the familiar 
words, ' ' Whosoever will save his life shall lose 
it," and ends with this singular sentence: 
"Philosophy, discovery, art, every sort of 
skill, every sort of service, love, these are the 
means of salvation from that narrow loneli- 
ness of desire, that brooding preoccupation 
with self and egotistical relationships, which 
is hell for the individual, treason to the race, 
and exile from God." These last words must 
come to many readers of the book with some 
astonishment as the first appearance of God 
on the scene. He is not otherwise mentioned, 
except once, and that in connection with the 
past. Yet it would appear that He was some- 
how in the minds of the world-managers. 

There is another interesting matter which 
seems to bear on this point. ' ' The World Set 
Free" ends with a fine account of the last 
days of Karenin, the great educational genius 
and organizer whose words have just been 
quoted. He was incurably crippled and de- 
formed and had to undergo an operation 
which killed him. As he talks with the direc- 
tors and doctors and nurses in the great hos- 
pital in the Himalayas, he asks whether he 
could not be patched up somehow so as to last 
a bit longer. But that is not possible. 

"I suppose," says he, "the time is not far 
off when such bodies will no longer be born 
into the world. ' ' 

"You see," says the Doctor, "it is neces- 
sary that spirits such as yours should be born 
into the world. ' ' 

The spirit of Karenin, what could that 
have been ? Was it merely his wonderful see- 
ing and organizing mind? He said himself 
that science was "the awakening mind of the 
race"; would he have said "the awakening 
spirit of the race," or would that have been 
something different? Surely we gather that 
there was something more to Karenin than 
his remarkable mind, something more to his 
life and art than his remarkable penetration 
and organization. There certainly seems the 
implication of something which was perhaps 
in mind when Karenin wrote of being ' ' exiled 
from God." But just what that something

was Mr. Wells does not say nor does it have 
much to do with his ideas on a world-state. 

Such things seem worth noting about Mr. 
Wells and his thinking. You may wonder 
why, if one disagree with him on such funda- 
mental matters, one thinks it worth while to 
read his books or to write of them. But few 
would ask such a question who have felt the 
fascination of any great writer, or, we might 
say, of Mr. Wells in particular. As one reads 
his books, whether agreeing with his ideas or 
not and generally one cannot fully agree 
with him one is carried along by the inter- 
est and suggestion of there being so many 
ideas, or even of any ideas at all. It is not so 
much that he "makes one think" according to 
the stock phrase, but that he suggests so much 
that is different from one's ordinary way of 
looking at things and yet so plausible, that 
one is constantly agreeing and disagreeing 
and always in a state where one wants to talk 
either to him or about him. 

Yet in addition to all this, it may be said 
that even though facts have not substantiated 
some of Mr. Wells 's ante-bellum ideas, and 
though our fundamental conceptions may pre- 
vent our accepting all his ideas for recon- 
struction, yet it is something to find one who 
has definite ideas about reconstruction. We 
may at least agree with him in the idea that 
there ought to be some sort of reconstruction 
after the madness of the moment has come to 
an end and men's minds may undertake some 
better scheme of things.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



BY WAY OF PARENTHESIS let a f ew tentative 
observations here be offered on a minor ques- 
tion of literary style. Some writers there are 
who never fail to unfold their thought in so 
logical and natural and altogether convincing 
a manner that the reader has a delightful 
sense of being lifted and carried, without jolt 
or jar, to a predestined goal. No sudden halts 
for repairs, no spasmodic sprints to make up 
the time lost in such halts, no time-wasting 
zig-zag side-trips on the way, rack the pas- 
senger 's nerves and fret his soul. Of this sure 
and steady gait are such prose masters as 
Johnson and Macaulay, to read whom is a rest 
and a relief from the chaos of one's own less 
strictly disciplined mental processes. Others 
there are, of a quite different habit, whose 
mode of progression, if not exactly that of the 
"razzle-dazzle," familiar to sea-side pleasure- 



seekers, yet bears some resemblance to the 
meanderings of the "roller-coaster" track. 
Mazes and involutions, doublings and turn- 
ings, lingerings and loiterings and wide cir- 
cumambulations, are dear to this order of 
writers, and the elaborate pattern traced by 
the pen of a master in this labyrinthine style 
moves to ecstasies of admiration and despair. 
In this category belong, preeminently, Walter 
Pater and Mr. Henry James. Each of these 
two so opposite manners has, of course, the 
defects of its qualities, and each may win from 
an impartial reader an equal degree of ap- 
proval, or of disapproval. One test of style as 
a sure and effective vehicle of thought is found 
in its suitability or unsuitability for oral 
recital. Many a person in the habit of reading 
aloud to others must have noted the ease and 
satisfaction with which certain authors may 
be thus interpreted to the listening ear, while 
others, equally or even more richly gifted, are 
an irritation and a torture to both him who 
reads and him who listens. Excessive use of 
the parenthesis is a not uncommon hindrance 
to ready recitability ; and it is not a rash 
assertion that the woman writer is more given 
than the man to this parenthetical style, this 
habit of catching at the first thought or image 
that presents itself, and then breaking off for 
a moment, sometimes a long moment, to make 
a place for omissions, or, so to speak, to pick 
up the dropped stitches, before completing the 
sentence. This rather awkward procedure 
might be likened to the headlong haste of a 
boy who, in dressing, inadvertently snatches 
up his coat and begins to put it on before 
donning his vest, and then, perceiving his 
error, holds his coat in suspension with his 
teeth while wriggling into his vest, after which 
exhibition of misapplied energy he succeeds in 
adjusting the other garment. 



"SHAKESPEARE EVERY DAY/' the motto of 
the Henry Jewett Players at the Boston Opera 
House, evidently assumes that the greatest of 
the world's dramatic poets is not too bright or 
good for human nature's daily food; and that 
this is no rash assumption one would fain be- 
lieve, as in fact one is encouraged to believe by 
the report that the production, since the begin- 
ning of the year, of the five plays, "As You 
Like It," "The Merchant of Venice," "The 
Merry Wives of Windsor," "Julius Cassar," 
and "Romeo and Juliet," has met with "the 
hearty approval of the press and the enthusi- 
astic support of the public." Here would 
seem to be gratifying proof, if proof were 
needed, that the great mass of wholesome, 
hearty, unaffected, workaday people really 
prefer good drama to worthless if they are but

allowed a choice. For the purposes of ade- 
quate and not too costly presentation of a 
rather long list of Shakespeare plays, a good 
stock company like the above-named, striving 
to attain and maintain "balance, smoothness, 
coordination, and careful detail," is likely in 
the long run to produce better results, both on 
the stage and in the box-office, than can be 
expected of a single star indifferently sup- 
ported. Like Mr. Granville Barker in his 
praiseworthy endeavors to provide the New 
York public with something better than the 
theatres have hitherto been offering, the 
Jewett Players, if their prospectus speaks 
truly, are striving to confer upon Boston a 
benefit of no mean sort. With the innumera- 
ble moving-picture houses and other cheap 
resorts as rivals in the amusement field, the 
management still hopes to win the increasing 
favor of the great public. Here is the beatific 
vision that inspires the movement: "The 
ideal toward which the management is con- 
stantly looking is the establishment of a per- 
manent repertory theatre in Boston, a theatre 
for all the people who love the drama, and not 
merely for habitual playgoers. ... To pro- 
vide the best in drama, presented by the best 
players obtainable, in the most beautiful play- 
house in America, and at the most reasonable 
of ' popular ' prices : this is the means whereby 
the management hopes to bring about that 
long-cherished dream of a theatre that shall 
be to Boston much the sort of institutional 
influence that the Comedie Francaise is to 

Paris." 



A GET-RICH-QUICK CULTURE naturally has its 
attractions for many in this stirring age and 
generation ; but it was this sort of crude cul- 
ture, or pseudo-culture, that received a sharp 
rap of condemnation from the president of 
Hamilton College at a recent teachers ' confer- 
ence held at the seat of that institution of 
learning. Urging a rally to the cause of the 
classics, and deprecating the increasing ten- 
dency to short-cuts through school and college, 
the speaker said : "If this practical and mer- 
cenary attitude continues, not only will the 
classics disappear from our curricula, but 
higher mathematics and the more advanced 
work in literature will also go." How much 
more than mere "polite literature" may be 
meant by a broadly based classical culture was 
long ago made clear by Matthew Arnold in 
reply to some of Huxley's depreciatory re- 
marks on Arnold's educational ideals. The 
scientist had averred that his distinguished 
contemporary referred only to belles lettres 
when he spoke of the need of knowing the best 
that has been thought and said by the modern 



nations ; to which Arnold replied in one of his 
American lectures (that on "Literature and 
Science") : "But as I do not mean, by know- 
ing ancient Rome, knowing merely more or 
less of Latin belles lettres, and taking no ac- 
count of Rome's military, and political, and 
legal, and administrative work in the world; 
and as, by knowing ancient Greece, I under- 
stand knowing her as the giver of Greek art, 
and the guide to a free and right use of reason 
and to scientific method, and the founder of 
our mathematics and physics and astronomy 
and biology, I understand knowing her as all 
this, and not merely knowing certain Greek 
poems, and histories, and treatises, and 
speeches, so as to the knowledge of modern 
nations also. By knowing modern nations, I 
mean not merely knowing their belles lettres, 
but knowing also what has been done by such 
men as Copernicus, Galileo, Newton, Darwin." 
It is safe to say that no system of get-rich- 
quick culture will give the world either any 
Arnolds or any Huxleys. 


A FOLLOWER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF CLARK 

RUSSELL, like him going to sea at a tender age, 
but continuing much longer this life on the 
ocean wave, like him turning to later literary 
account his salt-water experiences, though 
with somewhat less abundant productivity, 
and like him enjoying in his lifetime a gratify- 
ing degree of popular success, the late Frank 
Thomas Bullen (he died last month at 
Madeira) might well be called, so far as there 
is any meaning in the term, a self-made author. 
Born in London April 5, 1857, he received no 
school education after nine years of age, when 
he became an errand boy and began to make 
his own way in the world. At seventeen he 
turned sailor, and for fourteen years he was a 
sea-rover, visiting all parts of the world and 
rising to the position of chief mate, after which 
he accepted a junior clerkship in the Meteoro- 
logical Office, where he remained until 1890, 
making meanwhile occasional and not unsuc- 
cessful trial of his pen as a story-teller. In- 
deed, such encouragement did he receive from 
editors and readers of these tales of the sea 
that he decided to devote himself unreservedly 
to their composition. His whaling story, ' ' The 
Cruise of the 'Cachalot,' " in emulation of the 
work of a greater than he, the gifted author 
of "Moby Dick," is perhaps the best-known as 
it is among the most readable of his numerous 
romances of sea-faring, which include, among 
others, "A Whaleman's Wife," "Cut off 
from the World," "Creatures of the Sea," 
"A Son of the Sea," and "Sea- wrack." 
Somewhat different from these, and yet begot- 
ten of the same sort of activity and observa-

tion, are his "religious autobiography," 
"With Christ at Sea," and his book entitled 
' ' Sea Puritans. ' ' Though not a Herman Mel- 
ville or a Clark Russell or, still less, a Joseph 
Conrad, Bullen had won for himself an inti- 
mate knowledge of things maritime, and he 
wrote from the fulness of personal experience. 
Significant of his industry as a writer is the 
brief entry under the head of recreations in 
' ' Who 's Who. ' ' One word sufficed, ' ' none. ' ' 



A FAMOUS POLITICAL PAMPHLET, ' ' The Fight 

in Dame Europa's School," with appropriate 
and amusing illustrations by Thomas Nast, 
who was just beginning to achieve fame when 
the pamphlet was written, will bear a re- 
reading at this time, if one is so fortunate as 
to have access to a copy of the forty-four- 
year-old publication or any later reproduction 
of it. The satirical author begins in the fol- 
lowing pleasant vein, as some older readers 
may remember: "Mrs. Europa kept a dame 
school, where boys were well instructed in 
modern languages, fortification, and the use 
of the globes. Her connection and credit were 
good, for there was no other school where so 
sound and liberal an education could be ob- 
tained. . . . These lads at Mrs. Europa's were 
of all sorts and sizes good boys and bad 
boys, sharp boys and slow boys, industrious 
boys and idle boys, peaceable boys and pugna- 
cious boys, well-behaved boys and vulgar boys ; 
and of course the good old dame could not 
manage them all. So, as she did not like the 
masters to be prying about the playground out 
of school, she chose from among the biggest 
and most trustworthy of her pupils five moni- 
tors, who had authority over the rest of the 
boys, and kept the unruly ones in order. 
These five, at the time of which we are writing, 
were Louis, William, Aleck, Joseph, and 
John." Then follows, of course, the story of 
the fierce quarrel between Louis and William, 
with the awkward part played by the other 
monitors in their attempts to preserve a digni- 
fied neutrality ; and it is John 's conduct that 
receives the satirist's sharpest stabs. Among 
the innumerable printed products that owe 
their origin to the present war, a new "Dame 
Europa's School," modelled after the old, was 
sure to find a place. 

NEW BOOKS FOR OLD might sound like a good 
bargain to an unwary Princess Badroulbou- 
dour, but if the Aladdin in the case were any- 
thing of a bibliophile he would not thank his 
fair spouse for lending an ear to the specious 
offers of the book-peddling magician. In the 
latest report of the New York State Library, 
Mr. Wyer, the Director, announces the acquisi- 



tion of three hundred thousand "pieces" 
(presumably books, pamphlets, manuscripts, 
etc.) in partial replacement of the valuable 
collection destroyed by fire two years before. 
Yet he asserts that these considerable acces- 
sions "do not remotely approach three-fifths 
of the gross value and effectiveness of the 
500,000 pieces burned." And he continues: 
"There are two chief reasons for this: the 
increased cost of books and the impossibility 
of reproducing by a tour de force the costly 
organization and bibliographic apparatus for 
administration which was established in the 
old library. Not only have currently pub- 
lished books shared substantially in that in- 
creased cost which has marked luxuries as well 
as necessaries during the past ten or fifteen 
years, but older books, those outside the trade 
and technically known as ' out of print, ' espe- 
cially of certain kinds, have multiplied in 
value often many hundred fold." Both the 
spread of public libraries and the increase in 
the number of wealthy private collectors have 
contributed to raise the price of out-of-print 
books. The multimillionaire collector is a for- 
midable competitor for even the richest library 
to bid against, and the only possible course in 
such circumstances is usually for the library 
to possess its purse in patience and wait for 
the multimillionaire's inevitable relinquish- 
ment of his treasures in the course of nature, 
when they may be again thrown on the mar- 
ket or perhaps bequeathed to the very library 
most desirous of obtaining them. In the book 
world all things have a tendency to come to 

him who waits. 



AN EDITOR WITH AN IDEAL that he succeeds 
to a notable degree in realizing is in one sense 
a creative author, and so deserves something 
of the honor paid to gifted authorship. This, 
of course, presupposes that the ideal is con- 
siderably higher than that symbolized by the 
letter S crossed by two perpendicular lines. 
Of this high quality was the standard set for 
himself by the late Samuel Bowles, fourth of 
that name and third in successive editorship 
of the Springfield "Republican." Though he 
was, by genius and training, much more of a 
business manager than a man of letters, yet 
he was heir to the journalistic traditions of 
his father and grandfather, and succeeded in 
perpetuating those traditions as embodied in 
the newspaper founded ninety-one years ago. 
As his father before him had added the daily 
to the weekly issue of the journal, so he ex- 
tended its field by creating the Sunday 
"Republican," perhaps the best, the most 
respectable, the most worthy of a careful read- 
ing from beginning to end, of all our Sunday 



1915] 



THE DIAL

journals. Some of the minor peculiarities of 
the "Republican" have acquired a fame al- 
most as wide as its reputation, for literary 
excellence and general sanity. Its scholarly 
restraint in the use of capitals is commend- 
able, even though carried to some excess. Its 
slight leanings toward spelling-reform are 
chiefly praiseworthy in that they go no fur- 
ther. Mr. Bowles, who was in his sixty-fourth 
year when he died (March 14), seems to be 
succeeded by no Samuel Bowles the fifth, in 
the control of his paper, though he does leave 
a son of that name in journalism in another 
city; yet it is to be hoped and confidently 
expected that the standard of the "Repub- 
lican" will suffer no depression from his 

death. 



THE BOUNDLESSNESS OF THE FIELD OF AU- 
THORSHIP is now and then brought forcibly to 
one's realization. Unsuspected domains of 
literary activity reveal themselves upon glanc- 
ing however cursorily over the catalogue of 
almost any considerable collection of books. 
A list of bibliographies, dry in itself as the 
proverbial "remainder biscuit after a voy- 
age," is nevertheless a good eye-opener to the 
vastness of the world of things written about. 
This splendid spaciousness of the literary 
realm ' ' literary ' ' is here used in its largest 
sense was brought home to us not long ago 
by the appearance of a "Bibliography of 
Bibliographies," and is now again made in 
some sort apprehensible to the intelligence by 
a perusal of the latest report of that triply 
based institution whose foundations were laid 
by John Jacob Astor, James Lenox, and Sam- 
uel J. Tilden. For instance, it appears that 
in the Technology Division of that library 
there was recently compiled and published a 
list of works on oxy-acetylene welding, and 
even in so limited and specialized a branch of 
technical study there were enough treatises to 
furnish a catalogue thirty-four pages in 
length. It is small wonder that the special 
libraries, whereof so little was heard and so 
small account was made in our youth, have 
now their proper organization and are fast 
growing in number and importance. 



A NEW VARIETY OF THE JOURNALIST'S ART 

appeals for recognition in the world of letters ; 
it is to be known as rural journalism, and its 
mysteries will be taught, appropriately 
enough, at the agricultural college. The trus- 
tees of the school of farming at Amherst 
(Mass.) have voted to establish a "major" 
course in this latest branch of journalism, un- 
der the direction of Professor Robert "W. Neal, 



who has urged the innovation on the ground 
of "the extreme importance of the farm jour- 
nal and the country newspaper to country 
life." Agricultural schools, it is argued, in 
order to treat effectively the subject of farm- 
ing in all its phases and ramifications, have 
found it necessary to concern themselves with 
the economic and social interests of country 
life. Hence the attention they pay to the 
churches and schools as important factors in 
rural affairs ; and hence, too, their recognition 
of the newspaper as a powerful influence in 
the life and work of the farming community. 
In all this the man of letters will be disposed 
to see an acknowledgment that the pen is 
mightier than the plough. 


A PLEASING PROSPECT IN BIOGRAPHY Opens 

before us in the announcement of two forth- 
coming books on that brilliant author and 
many-sided, lovable, and always interesting 
man, the late Father Hugh Benson, recently 
cut off in the early prime of his remarkable 
pow r ers. The more full and formal biography 
will be that prepared by Benson's friend, 
Father Martindale, who, a brilliant man him- 
self, is said to have understood his brilliant 
associate as well as to have loved him. There 
will also be the less elaborate but probably 
more touching tribute from the elder brother, 
Mr. Arthur Christopher Benson, under the 
title, "Hugh: The Memoir of a Brother." 
From such passages of biographical reminis- 
cence as have already come from his pen as 
in "The Leaves of the Tree" and in several of 
his volumes of miscellaneous essays one may 
safely assume that the promised fraternal 
sketch will be likely to take its place among 
the books that are not soon allowed to perish 
from memory. 



COMMUNICATION. 



A WOED OF EXPLANATION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of March 4 the statement is made 
that " a branch of the St. Louis Public Library 
was wiped out by fire." Although technically cor- 
rect, this statement is, I fear, apt to be misleading. 
The fire was that which destroyed the Missouri 
Building at the St. Louis World's Fair. In this 
building among other things was an exhibit of the 
American Library Association, which was operated 
as a temporary branch of the St. Louis Public 
Library. The building, like most of those at 
world's fairs, was of light temporary construction, 
and therefore easily burned. Our regular branches 
are all of fire-proof construction.

FROM CANOE TO AEROPLANE IN 
AMERICAN TRAVEL.* 



In no field of invention is the cumulative 
rapidity of progress more impressive than in 
the development of modern means of travel. 
Truism though it be that every fresh discovery 
of science makes possible a hundred additional 
discoveries and inventions, so that the rate of 
advance is represented by a geometrical pro- 
gression having a very large constant factor, 
the marvel of modern scientific and industrial 
progress never loses its power to impress and 
fairly to daze the imagination. Even the 
crudest conjecture of what astounding results 
may be possible to applied science in a single 
decade or half-decade of the twenty-first 
century, if already that brief space of time 
suffices for achievements exceeding the total of 
accomplishment witnessed by entire centuries, 
is enough to take away the breath. Confining 
himself to that department of applied science 
which has to do with the means of locomotion, 
and also limiting his researches to our own 
country and, in the main, to the century end- 
ing with the completion of the first transcon- 
tinental railway, Mr. Seymour Dunbar has 
nevertheless found ample material, both docu- 
mentary and illustrative, for the filling of a 
four-volume work which is thus comprehen- 
sively designated on the title-page: "A His- 
tory of Travel in America. Showing the 
Development of Travel and Transportation 
from the Crude Methods of the Canoe and the 
Dog-Sled to the Highly Organized Railway 
Systems of the Present, Together with a Nar- 
rative of the Human Experiences and Chang- 
ing Social Conditions that Accompanied this 
Economic Conquest of the Continent." It is 
elaborately equipped "with maps and other 
illustrations reproduced from early engrav- 
ings, original contemporaneous drawings and 
broadsides." A final chapter gives a "sum- 
mary of present conditions" and briefly fore- 
shadows the wonders to come, including of 
course the still unimagined developments of 
aerial navigation. Then follow a hundred 
pages of appended matter, historical and sta- 
tistical, and an elaborate fifty-page index, the 
whole work attaining the rather formidable 
proportions of 1529 pages. So impressive a 
monument to a single person's industry and 
scholarship cannot fail to command admira- 
tion.

waterways and famous trails that our histo- 
rians and descriptive writers have of late pro- 
duced, much of the present work will be more 
or less familiar to many readers ; but its point 
of view, most of its details, and not a few of 
its illustrations, will probably be found to pos- 
sess a pleasing novelty, and their manner of 
presentation, by which is meant, not least of 
all, the sumptuous appearance of these well- 
made volumes, will not fail to attract. In his 
attitude toward his subject the author natu- 
rally and properly fails not, throughout, to 
uphold the dignity and importance and far- 
reaching significance of his theme. Modes of 
moving from place to place he considers indica- 
tive of the degree of development attained by 
the people using them; and a well-developed 
vehicular traffic is of course a potent instru- 
ment for the material and intellectual improve- 
ment of the society in which it is found. This 
philosophy of the matter, however pleasing 
and satisfying to the author and his readers, 
has nevertheless its weak points. If a people's 
method of travel is to serve as a criterion of its 
general enlightenment and progress, the 
Greeks of the time of Pericles ought to be 
accounted as little better than barbarians, and 
the subjects of King Cheops, notwithstanding 
the testimony of the Pyramids, could hardly 
be said to have emerged from savagery. But, 
granting the soundness of the author's theory 
in the main, let us allow him to set forth in his 
own words something of the plan and purpose 
of his work. In his opening chapter he says : 
" The subject to which these pages are devoted 
is the foundation whereon the country, considered 
as a social and industrial organization, has been 
built. A few years ago until as late a date as 
1806 the six or seven million people of America 
were contentedly visiting their friends, or moving 
about on business, in flatboats, dog-sleds, stage- 
coaches, strange wagons or canoes. Those were the 
only vehicles of travel, and when they were not 
available, as was very often the case, the traveller 
walked or else rode upon a horse. To go from the 
Atlantic seacoast to such remote regions as Cin- 
cinnati or St. Louis or Fort Dearborn now Chi- 
cago in those days meant a journey of many 
weary weeks, with possibly the loss of a scalp. 
Such a thing as a trip across the continent and 
back was not within the range of thought of the 
ordinary man. ... In this present realm of four- 
day ocean steamships, of trains that dive beneath 
rivers or plunge through a thousand miles in 
twenty hours, of subways, motor-cars, submarine 
boats, and with the flying machine just beginning 
to dot the sky, we are privileged to remember, if 
we choose, that once upon a time the express boats 
on the canals maintained a speed of three miles an 
hour for day after day, and that the Pioneer Fast 
Line advertised it would rush its passengers 
through from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh in four 
days and often nearly kept its word."

In its wealth of contents, the book first sur- 
veys the general condition and appearance of 
our country in its infancy, pointing out the 
all but insuperable difficulties of travel 
through the dense forests, and giving some 
account of the early Indian trails ; then traces 
the gradual growth of improved means of com- 
munication as influenced and accelerated by 
the condition and needs of the people, and 
argues that it was universal transportation 
facilities, rather than politics or war, that 
acted as the compelling force for real national 
unity; brings forward much new material in 
illustration of social conditions and modes of 
travel in the middle and far "West, with 
glimpses of pioneer life and details concerning 
the government's dealings with our native 
tribes ; and, in its later chapters, exhibits the 
on-rush of our population into the vast west- 
ern domain made at last accessible to all by the 
road of iron. With a "summary of present 
conditions," as already stated, the fascinating 
narrative comes to a close. As a sample of its 
quality, a passage describing the old-fashioned 
tavern breakfast will here serve as well as 
another : 

" Then came the breakfast ceremonial. The host 
marched to the front door, lifted a cow's horn to 
his lips and sent forth the resounding blast that 
summoned all hands to the table. Some landlords 
preferred a big bell rather than a horn, and filled 
the air with a clangor heard for a mile around. A 
meal at one of the early taverns was nearly always 
a bountiful repast, and usually ended, whether at 
breakfast, dinner or supper, with two or more 
kinds of pie. Everything was put on the big table 
at once, and everybody ate until he reluctantly 
made up his mind to stop. In those days a meal 
meant all a man wanted to eat. The price re- 
mained the same. A slice of bread was visible 
even when the edge of it was held toward the eye. 
the butter could be safely attributed to the cow, 
and a third cup of tea or glass of milk was as 
smilingly produced, if called for, as the first. In 
short, the deplorable deficiency in varieties of 
knives and forks, and in different species of spoons 
as measured by modern requirements was 
made up by a plenitude of things that could be 
eaten instead of looked at." 

The beginning of certain reprehensible 
practices in railroad finance that are now only 
too well known to us of a later generation is 
traced back to about the middle of last cen- 
tury, or, more definitely, to the year 1848, and 
is thus noticed by the author in connection 
with the general railway development of the 
period : 

" At about this time, however, there likewise 
appeared the first outwai'd symptoms of an un- 
fortunate condition that was destined to become 
much more prominent as the years went on, and 
that has injuriously affected the railway system of 



the country since the period mentioned. Although 
the people as a whole had cast out their mania and 
viewed the subjects of railroad construction and 
administration with saner eyes, a small but influ- 
ential portion of the population did not follow 
their example. Those avaricious men who repre- 
sented, in the economic and political affairs of 
their day. the influences which these later times 
have come to define as ' predatory wealth ' and 
' special privilege,' were beginning to recognize the 
opportunities that would lie within their grasp if 
they could control so vital a portion 'of the nation's; 
industrial fabric as the railways were obviously 
destined to become. They caught glimpses of the 
power that would be theirs if they built, operated 
and manipulated railways as gigantic weapons, 
rather than as agencies of public benefit which 
would methodically aid in the creation of new 
wealth through the operation of those processes 
they were primarily designed to perform. To 
characters so warped, and to able minds so inclined, 
the lure was irresistible and the result was sure. 
Thus began the extensive practice of building rail- 
ways with the object of acquiring money through 
their construction rather than by their later efficient 
operation." 

Then is described in outline the nefarious 
scheme w r hereby, with occasional differences in 
detail but with a wearisome sameness in essen- 
tial rascality, the too-trusting investor of the 
last half-century or more has been plundered 
by the unprincipled and avaricious railroad- 
promoter and railroad-wrecker. 

A noteworthy chapter of the concluding 
volume is devoted to the history of the great 
Mormon overland pilgrimage of 1846-8, re- 
lating the events that led up to it, the expul- 
sion of the Church of Latter-day Saints from 
Nauvoo, the sufferings of the migrating party, 
the discovery of the Great Salt Lake Valley, 
and the final settlement of the wandering host 
in the new land of promise after two and a 
half years of vagrancy. 

Mr. Dunbar has spared no pains to make his 
book all that the promise of its title-page leads 
one to expect. His diligence is beyond praise, 
his range of research amazing. Libraries and 
historical societies, antiquaries and special 
authorities, have been called upon, not in vain, 
to swell the riches and perfect the historical 
accuracy of his stately volumes. If a reviewer 
were to presume, from the lesser resources of 
his own equipment, to offer any general criti- 
cism as he closes with hearty commendation 
this absorbing story of a great movement in 
American civilization, it would perhaps take 
the form of a regret that the greatness of the 
theme is not always matched by an equal 
greatness of style in the writer. A certain 
unfailing niceness in the choice of words, a 
true sense of the literary possibilities and im- 
possibilities of a subject or a situation, a

scholarly avoidance of excesses of any sort, 
are not among the outstanding merits of the 
author's style as displayed in this book. He 
makes, too, the rather frequent mistake of 
crediting his readers with too little rather than 
too much intelligence. On one page, for in- 
stance, he takes the trouble to explain what a 
railway "turnout" is, and at the foot of 
another he thinks it necessary to add a note to 
the effect that ' ' a public house was also called 
an ordinary. * ' Probably it is better, all things 
considered, to overestimate than to underesti- 
mate a reader's mental equipment; at any 
rate, it is a Coleridgian axiom that an uneluci- 
dated obscurity is a compliment to the reader 's 
acuteness. 

Four hundred illustrations, colored and un- 
colored, with two folding maps, add no little to 
the book's attractiveness and interest. The 
quality of its typography and press-work is in 
accord with the other excellences of the work.

THE ARCH-PRIEST OF GERMAN 
IMPERIALISM.* 



One of the "literary" results of the Euro- 
pean war has been the resuscitation of a group 
of writers of German birth or affiliations who 
had been largely forgotten or who were 
formerly known only to a small number of 
scholars. Among these may be mentioned the 
military writers, Clausewitz and Bernhardi, 
the philosopher Nietzsche, and the historian 
Treitschke. This result has been the work 
chiefly of Englishmen who believe they have 
found in the teachings of these writers all the 
abominable doctrines of imperialism, mili- 
tarism, the supremacy of force, the blind 
idolatry of the State, and other ideas of the 
kind which now reign in Germany. 

Treitschke 's \vritings in particular have 
been translated, edited, and republished in 
numerous editions, and are now being widely 
read by the English and American public. 
Three of the most recent of these publications 
are Mr. Joseph McCabe's "Treitschke and the 
Great War," Mr. H. W. C. Davis 's "The 
Political Thought of Heinrich von Treitschke, ' ' 
and the collection of translated essays entitled 
"Germany, France, Russia, and Islam." The 
first mentioned is a commentary on Treitschke 's 
political theories, and an estimate of their in- 
fluence upon the thought and national life of 
the Germans. As such it is a very interesting

contribution; but unfortunately it is marred 
by evidences of strong prejudice and at times 
of unfairness. 

The work of Mr. Davis is less a commentary 
or analysis, and more of a collection of ex- 
tracts from Treitschke 's historical and po- 
litical writings, especially his Politik, which 
consists of two volumes of lectures delivered 
at the University of Berlin. Happily, there 
is here less evidence of bias than in the first 
mentioned work. For this and other reasons 
it is a more trustworthy and useful book for 
English and American students of Treitschke 's 
political philosophy. 

The third book is a collection of Treitschke 's 
essays dealing with questions of German for- 
eign politics. They are unaccompanied by 
any comment or criticism except a brief prefa- 
tory analysis by Mr. George Haven Putnam. 
They include papers on German relations 
with other powers. Turkey and the great 
nations, Germany and the oriental question, 
what Germany demands of France, the German 
Empire, and other essays. The ideas which 
run through them all are characteristic of 
Treitschke 's political thought: the doctrine 
of imperialism, Germany's mission as a world 
power, the rule of force, etc. 

Treitschke 's was a unique personality in 
many respects. He was a Saxon by birth, but 
of Czech ancestry. His father was a general 
in the army, and the son would doubtless have 
chosen a military career had an accident not 
deprived him of his hearing. He studied and 
taught in various German universities, but in 
1874 he was called to the University of Berlin, 
where he remained until his death in 1896. 
He was distinguished by his historical scholar- 
ship and his eloquence as a lecturer, and prob- 
ably no German professor ever lectured to 
larger audiences or more completely capti- 
vated his hearers. He started out as a liberal, 
but after his removal to Berlin he became an 
ultra-conservative and an ardent supporter of 
Bismarck, an enemy to the Social Democrats, 
and a glorifier of the Hohenzollern dynasty. 
He became a member of the Reichstag in 1871, 
where he sat continuously until 1888, when he 
resigned largely out of disgust because of 
the increasing influence of the Social Demo- 
crats. 

His political philosophy may be summed up 
in the following ideas: The essence of the 
State is power, and it is to be found in a well- 
equipped and well-drilled army; it is not a 
mere academy of arts or sciences. The State 
belies its own nature when it neglects the 
army, therefore the organization of the army 
is one of the first constitutional questions for 
the consideration of the State; the army is

THE DIAL

the foundation of political freedom, so that 
we need not waste pity on states that have a 
powerful and well-drilled army. The State 
exists over and apart from the individuals 
who compose it; and it is entitled to their 
utmost sacrifices, in short, they exist for it 
rather than the State for them. 

Treitschke has been much reproached for 
his views regarding the binding force of 
treaties; and the responsibility for the "scrap 
of paper" theory of which we have heard so 
much lately is attributed to him. His views 
upon this point are substantially as follows: 
The State is subject to no human superior; 
any restrictions upon its sovereignty are mere 
voluntary and self-imposed limitations; all 
treaty obligations are subject to the rule of 
rebus sic stantibus, and therefore treaties 
which have outlived their usefulness may be 
denounced and replaced by new ones which 
correspond to the new conditions. Every 
State, therefore, is the final judge of its obli- 
gations, and the duty of self-preservation may 
require it to repudiate treaties which are in- 
consistent with its own progress and existence. 
There is no reputable writer on international 
law to-day who would contest the soundness 
of this view; yet Treitschke 's disciples have 
employed his doctrine of rebus sic stantibus 
in a sense which he apparently did not intend 
it to be understood, and his critics have like- 
wise attributed to him the responsibility for, 
the view, now apparently held by some Ger- 
mans, that treaties may be denounced and 
rejected upon mere grounds of inconvenience. 

The deification of war runs through the 
whole of Treitschke 's historical and political 
writings. Again and again he speaks of the 
"moral majesty," the "moral grandeur," and 
the "moral sublimity" of war. In his Politik 
he says: "War is political science par ex- 
cellence. Over .and over again has it been 
proved that it is only in war that a people 
becomes indeed a people. It is only in the 
common performance of heroic deeds for the 
sake of the Fatherland that a nation becomes 
truly and spiritually united." "The second 
important function of the State," we are told, 
"is warfare. That men have so long refused 
to recognize this fact proves how emasculated 
political science has become in the hands of 
civilians." "If it had not been for war, there 
would be no States. It is to war that all the 
States we know of owe their existence. The 
protection of its citizens by strength of arms 
is the first and foremost duty of the State. 
Therefore wars must continue to the end of 
history as long as there is a plurality of 
States. Neither logic nor human nature re- 
veal any probability that it could ever be 



otherwise. The blind votaries of perpetual 
peace fall into error of either mentally iso- 
lating the individual State, or else of imag- 
ining a World-State, which we have already 
shown to be an absurdity." 

Again he says : ' ' Any one with a knowledge 
of history realises that to expel war from the 
universe would be to mutilate human nature. 
There can be no freedom unless there can be a 
warlike force, prepared to sacrifice itself for 
freedom. We must repeat that scholars, in con- 
sidering this question, are apt to argue from 
the quiet assumption that the State is merely 
intended to be an Academy of the Fine Arts 
and Sciences. That is one of its functions, 
but not the most important. If a State 
neglects its physical in favor of its intellectual 
energies, it falls into decay. ' ' 

Time and again he dwells upon the glories 
of war, the duty of men to sacrifice not only 
their lives but the "natural and deep-rooted 
feelings of the human soul for a great patri- 
otic idea," the impossibility of liberty without 
war, and the self -stultification of those who 
think that warfare can be eliminated from the 
world. War is the only remedy for sick na- 
tions ; without war all progress will disappear 
from history; it has always been the ex- 
hausted, spiritless, enervated ages that have 
played with the dream of universal peace. 

Treitschke had no admiration for England 
or the English. On the contrary, his feeling 
toward them was largely one of contempt. 
More than any one else, he is held responsible 
by the English for the anti-English sentiment 
which blazed out during the Boer War, and 
which has since reigned in German society 
and in the press. For this reason English 
historians and editors of his writings have not 
always interpreted his political theories fairly 
or correctly. 

Finally, it may be seriously doubted whether 
Treitschke 's teachings have ever exerted any- 
thing like the influence on the thought and life 
of the German people that the English now 
attribute to them. He was primarily a uni- 
versity professor; and while he lectured to 
large audiences of students, the number of 
persons who were directly affected by his doc- 
trines was probably comparatively small. At 
the time, his views, now so much detested by 
Englishmen, attracted little attention; and 
had it not been for the present war they would 
have remained unknown to the great mass of 
mankind. JAMES W. GARNER. 

Mr. Ludwig Lewisohn has made a critical resume 
of the dramatic literature of the last three decades 
which will be published by Mr. B. W. Huebsch 
under the title of " The Modern Drama : An Essay 
in Interpretation."

BROWNING'S WOMEN.* 



The stream of Browning books continues. 
If they were all of one type, that of uncritical 
praise and adulation, we might heartily wish 
the habit would die out; but fortunately we 
have now and then a book or essay from one 
who is not altogether a Browningite, and who 
endeavors to see Browning's work not through 
colored or distorting glasses but as it really is. 
Of such a character is Miss Mayne's volume 
on "Browning's Heroines," and we welcome 
it as on the whole a contribution of importance 
to the discussion of Browning's artistry. 

We must first say one or two things about 
the style of the book. It gives us constantly 
the impression of effort to be vivacious; this 
it generally is, but, with its superabundance 
of short sentences, its rows of periods indi- 
cating omissions, its questions, it is also jerky 
and suggestive of a lack of poise. It is far 
from the simple, effective style which would 
carry far greater weight, and over which men 
have no monopoly. One specimen will suffice. 
The author is describing Pippa's reflections at 
the close of her one day : 

"But gradually the atmosphere of her mind 
seems restored; the fogs of envy and curiosity 
begin to clear off she goes over the game of 
make-believe, how she was in turn each of the 
Pour . . . but no! the miasma is still in the air, 
and she's ' tired of fooling/ and New Year's Day 
is over, and ill or well, she must be content. . . . 
Even her lily's asleep, but she will wake it up, and 
show it the friend she has plucked for it the 
flower she gathered as she passed the house on the 
hill. . . . Alas! even the flower seems infected. 
She compares it, ' this pampered thing,' this double 
heartsease of the garden, with the wild growth, 
and once more Zanze comes to mind isn't she 
like the pampered blossom 1 ? And if there were a 
king of the flowers, ' and a girl-show held in his 
bowers,' which would he like best, the Zanze or the 
Pippa? . . . [all these periods are in the text]. 
No; nothing will conquer her dejection; fancies 
will not do, awakening sleepy lilies will not do," 
etc., etc. 

This is of course indirect discourse ; but does 
it quite fit? 

While the book is interesting, it cannot be 
said that all parts are of equal value. In the 
case of some heroines no new point of view is 
presented; the character is merely described 
as we are already familiar with her. This is 
true, for example, of much of what is said 
about Pompilia, about the Countess Gismond, 
even about Pippa. Was it worth while to go 
over the story of each of the poems at such 
length? Except for a certain class of imma- 
ture or indolent readers, we doubt it. Too

frontispiece and decorations by Maxwell Armfield. New 
York: James Pott & Co. 



much of the book is taken up with the retelling 
of the stories, with copious though well chosen 
quotations. 

But other parts of the book are important. 
For example, we may take the treatment of 
Mildred Tresham. Miss Mayne thinks Brown- 
ing did not understand her, and therefore did 
not succeed in his portrayal of her ; and Miss 
Mayne is right. 

" What a girl he might have given us in Mildred, 
had he listened only to himself! But, not yet in 
full possession of that self, he set up as an ideal 
the ideal of others, trying dutifully to see it as 
they see it, denying dutifully his deepest instinct; 
and, thus apostate, piled insincerity on insincerity, 
until at last no truth is anywhere, and we read on 
with growing alienation as each figure loses all of 
such reality as it ever had, and even Gwendolen, 
the ' golden creature ' his own dauntless, indi- 
vidual woman, seeing and feeling truly through 
every fibre of her being is lost amid the fog." 

Likewise she is right in what she says of 
Pompilia : 

" Pompilia is a living soul, not a puppet of the 
theatre. Yet even here the same strange errors 
recur. She has words indeed that reach the inmost 
heart poignant, overpowering in tenderness and 
pathos; but she has, also, words that cause the 
brows to draw together, the mind to pause un- 
easily, then to cry l Not so ! ' Of such is the analysis 
of her own blank ignorance with regard to the 
marriage-state." 

Was the Lady of the Glove wrong? Miss 
Mayne thinks so. 

" And so the Lady thought right and did wrong : 
'twas not love set that task to humanity. Even 
Browning cannot win her our full pardon." 

Miss Mayne will not allow that the age was 
different from ours : 

" Women's hearts were the same ; and a woman's 
heart, when it loves truly, will make no test for 
very pride-in-love's dear sake. It scorns tests 
too much scorns them, it may be." 

But has she not already conceded that the age 
was different when she says above that for 
these great gifts 

"the endless descriptions of death 
He would brave when my lip formed a breath, 

the lady "must give in return her love, as 
love was understood at the court of King 
Francis"? Is it not true that love in its rela- 
tion to marriage was differently conceived in 
those days, and that we are not to judge of 
that age by standards which apply only (so 
far as we know} to our own ? In fact, is it not 
paradoxical to say that she thought right and 
did wrong? If her act was the logical result 
of right thinking, how can it be maintained to 
have been a wrong act ? 

One remark which the author makes about 
Phene is, it seems to us. merely fanciful: 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



259 



" In this Passing of Pippa, silence and song 
have met and mingled into one another, for Phene 
is silence, as Pippa is song. Phene will speak 
more when Jules and she are in their isle together 
but never will she speak much : she is silence." 

How do we know all this about Phene? "We 
never see her normal self in the poem. 

And when the author repeats, apparently 
with approval, Mr. Chesterton's comment, 
that having made Pippa Monsignor 's niece, 
"Browning might just as well have made 
Sebald her long-lost brother, and Luigi a hus- 
band to whom she was secretly married," we 
must protest. Surely Browning had the same 
right to represent Monsignor as Pippa 's uncle 
that he had to cause the Happiest Four in 
Asolo to hear Pippa 's song at the precise mo- 
ment when it would influence each of them as 
it does; and who are we that we should dis- 
pute him? "We suppose that the point at- 
tempted in the above quotation is that making 
Monsignor Pippa 's uncle renders the situation 
too melodramatic; but even if one were to 
concede this, is melodrama necessarily un- 
truthful? In that world of poetry of which, 
after all, Pippa is a denizen, we must take 
things as we find them. 

In spite of these adverse comments, how- 
ever, it is our opinion that the volume con- 
tains much that is good. Miss Mayne has read 
her Browning carefully and with open eyes. 
Of her contention that Browning has been in- 
jured by the blind worship of some of his 
followers there is no doubt. And her book 
will assuredly help to set forth the great poet 
in a truer light. CLARK S. NORTHUP. 



How NAPOLEON ORGANIZED VICTORY.* 



The group of books which any publishing 
season adds to the already astonishing mass 
of Napoleonic literature gives evidence at least 
of the heterogeneous interest which the great 
man's career still provokes. The particular 
kind of interest seems occasionally beneath 
the level of decent historical investigation. 
Why devote a volume to Count Leon, the vic- 
tim in other words, the offspring of one 
of Napoleon 's most fugitive amours ? All that

is worth saying about this pitiful existence 
could be put in a single sketch. Fortunately, 
few authors err in such a choice of subject. 
Fortunately, also, in nearly every group of 
books two or three are found which distinctly 
advance the serious study of Napoleon's 
achievements, and do this without committing 
the blunder of being dull. The most recent 
examples of this latter type are Mr. Edward 
Foord 's "Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 
1812" and Colonel Vachee 's "Napoleon at 
Work, ' ' published in Paris a little over a year 
ago and now translated. 

Colonel Vachee had a definite pedagogical 
purpose in preparing his book. He desired 
to set forth in the person of the greatest of 
modern military leaders the characteristics of 
successful leadership. He had in mind the 
"future wars" in which France might be 
obliged to take a part, wars which within 
six months ceased to be future, and became 
tragically present. His method is not didactic 
but descriptive. He shows how Napoleon 
reached his decisions, and the exact manner 
in which at every stage of the proceedings 
the execution of his plan was secured. This 
necessitates a careful description of the im- 
perial staff and of the functions of each prin- 
cipal officer. Colonel Vachee includes also two 
chapters upon Napoleon's "Rewards and 
Penalties," which were designed to secure the 
fidelity of soldiers as well as officers, and were 
suggested by a Machiavellian shrewdness. The 
last two chapters of the book deal with "Na- 
poleon on the Battlefield." The material for 
this study is drawn from official records and 
correspondence, and from the recollections of 
those brought into intimate contact with Na- 
poleon during his campaigns. One of the 
most valuable witnesses is Baron Fain, long 
Napoleon's trusted private secretary. 

The secret of Napoleon's successes lay in 
Colonel Vachee 's opinion, not merely in his 
skill as a strategist, but chiefly in the energy 
and rapidity with which he drove his orders 
through to fulfilment. On a campaign he 
was accustomed to go to sleep at eight and to 
get up at twelve. The orders for the next day 
were drawn up and despatched between mid- 
night and morning. A single illustration will 
show how time, so vital in moving large bodies 
of troops, was saved. Two or three days be- 
fore the battle of Jena, when his headquarters 
were at Auma, the orders sent to all six corps 
and the cavalry were despatched between three 
and four-thirty in the morning. The order 
to Bernadotte, who was then eighteen miles 
away, was received in three hours and fifteen 
minutes. Bernadotte 's corps, of more than 
20,000 men, was on the march within an hour 



260 



THE DIAL 



[April 1 



and three-quarters, and at the close of the day 
had marched seventeen miles. 

Napoleon's camp was always an agitated 
scene. Neither his private secretaries nor his 
aids knew when they would be called upon 
for service, day or night. He would wake up 
suddenly and ask for his maps and his secre- 
taries. When the work was done, his next 
exclamation might be, "The carriage!" or 
"To horse!" Horses were kept saddled and 
bridled, and held by attendants. He had a 
campaign carriage, which could be driven in a 
few hours over the distance covered by the 
army in a day. On the night before a battle 
he usually reconnoitered the enemy's position 
personally in order that his final directions to 
his generals might take account of the latest 
changes in the situation. At Jena he was so 
venturesome that upon his return to his lines 
he was nearly shot by one of his own outposts. 

Colonel Vachee regards the organization of 
Napoleon's staff as defective. Indeed, it was 
so complex that even the lucid account of it in 
this volume leaves the mind of the reader 
sadly confused. The machinery for recording 
and transmitting orders seems to have been 
efficient, principally because it operated im- 
mediately under the eyes of the master and 
of Berthier, his chief of staff. Napoleon was 
not accustomed to explain to his corps com- 
manders, even when a great battle was immi- 
nent, what his plan was. He did this to 
certain favorite generals, while to the others 
he gave specific orders, leaving them quite in 
the dark upon the general scheme. Sometimes 
the consequences of such a method were un- 
fortunate. This is the explanation, for ex- 
ample, of Bernadotte 's inaction on October 14, 
1806, taking part neither in the battle of Jena 
nor going to the assistance of Davout in his 
struggle with the Prussians at Auerstadt. The 
most fatal consequences came when Napoleon 's 
own energy was diminished, and when this 
lack was not made up by the initiative of his 
subordinates. 

Two or three of the minor personages of 
Napoleon's staff are well described by Colonel 
Vachee. One was D'Albe, the topographical 
secretary, who had served Napoleon for seven- 
teen years. He would stick colored pins into 
the maps of the region to represent the exact 
position of the different corps, as this was 
indicated in the latest reports. The same 
would be done for the position of the enemy's 
army, so far as it was known. In the night 
time the map was surrounded by twenty 
candles. If a despatch came, the conclusions 
from it were entered on the map; and Na- 
poleon, compass in hand, would bend over it 
measuring the distances. Sometimes the map 



was so large that both Napoleon and D'Albe 
would lie flat upon it, discussing the situations 
and distances. Occasionally in their excite- 
ment their heads came together violently. 
D ' Albe 's knowledge was so indispensable that 
Napoleon treated him more confidentially than 
any other officer in the army. He, if any one, 
knew what steps the master's mind was fol- 
lowing in arriving at a plan of the decisive 
manoeuvre. 

Another confidential officer, D'Ideville, was 
both interpreter and statistician of foreign 
armies. Napoleon in military affairs as in 
civil administration was systematic in obtain- 
ing and recording useful information. The 
strength of foreign armies naturally interested 
him. His officers and even ambassadors and 
other diplomatic agents had orders to send to 
Paris every scrap of information about the 
strength, position, and movements of foreign, 
armies. All this was carefully sifted and sum- 
marized, so that Napoleon often knew as 
much about foreign armies as about his own. 
On a campaign D'Ideville was always with 
him, and if a prisoner was brought in D'Ide- 
ville questioned him in his own language, and 
the information was classified with the rest. 
Napoleon occasionally amused himself in 
times of peace by telling ambassadors about 
movements of their armies of which they had 
not been advised and requesting an explana- 
tion. 

It is satisfactory to note that although 
Colonel Vachee sees much to admire in Na- 
poleon as a military leader, he is not blind to 
Napoleon's defects as a man and a statesman. 
Indeed, the selfishness of the Emperor, his 
egoism (to use the favorite word of French 
writers) , receives quite sufficient emphasis. It 
is a question whether the author does not 
overstep the limits of his task in stating how 
the baser imperial appetites were provided for 
through the solicitude of such distinguished 
panders as Talleyrand, Berthier, Murat, and 
Duroc. 

Mr. Foord 's volume shows how Napoleon in 
1812 instead of organizing victory sent his 
greatest army to final defeat and ruin, mainly 
through failure to estimate adequately the 
climatic and geographical conditions of a cam- 
paign in Russia. His transport system broke 
down before the army reached Vilna, fifty 
miles from the frontier. For one thing, the 
wagons proved to be too heavy for the Polish 
roads, which were turned into a quagmire by 
five or six days of rain. In several of Na- 
poleon's decisions during the campaign the 
author sees not merely natural miscalculation 
but a decline of that mental alertness and 
power of imagination which had accounted for 



1915]

so many victorious campaigns. One of the 
most striking instances is the order given at 
Orsha on the retreat to destroy the reserve 
bridge train of sixty pontoons. Mr. Foord 
says that Baron Eble, chief of the bridge 
trains, "alive to the danger, pressed to be 
allowed to keep fifteen pontoons, but in vain, 
and he could save only 2 field forges, 2 wag- 
gons of charcoal and 6 of implements." And 
this happened when the passage of the Bere- 
zina was imminent. The special qualities of 
Mr. Foord 's treatment are his careful atten- 
tion to details of food, clothing, discipline, 
and morale at various stages of the campaign. 
He writes with full appreciation of Welling- 
ton's dictum that an army "moves on its 
belly," and if that is empty the fate of the 
army is sealed. The crowning disasters of the 
retreat he attributes to the lack of discipline, 
due in part to a month of pillage in Moscow 
and to the large number of non-combatants, 
including many women, by whom the army 
was accompanied. Equally illuminating is 
the author's handling of the military prob- 
lems, the question of Bagration's escape 
from King Jerome, the fiasco of the Drissa 
camp, the refusal of Napoleon to put in the 
Imperial Guard at Borodino, and others. 

The handsome volume which is devoted to 
the vicissitudes of "An Unknown Son of Na- 
poleon (Count Leon) " comes very close in its 
early chapters to the bounds of pornographic 
literature. After it leaves the story of the 
father and mother and takes up that of the 
son, it deals with melodrama, often that 
which is on the edge of the gutter. Every 
folly of the son is, however, another blot on 
the memory of such a father. One must pro- 
test, furthermore, against the wrong of 
dragging out into the light of notoriety the 
descendants of the mother or those of the 
child. This is cruelty which can hide behind 
no shred of reason. 

A much pleasanter book is Montagu's "Na- 
poleon and His Adopted Son." No figure in 
the Napoleonic gallery is more attractive than 
that of Eugene, Viceroy of Italy. As ruler of 
Napoleon's Italian kingdom he deserves a 
place among the makers of modern Italy. He 
was not a great statesman, and he was too 
subservient to his step-father's will; and yet 
during his reign Italy took certain steps in 
administrative and military reorganization 
which were not wholly retraced when the 
Grand Empire fell. This work deals almost 
exclusively with Eugene's personal and mili- 
tary career. One will consult it in vain for 
any adequate account of the Napoleonic re- 
gime in the Italian kingdom. The book is 
not free from inadvertencies, as, for example, 



when Eugene at Marengo is said to have 
helped by "his repeated charges to drive the 
Italian troops back into Milan." 

"The Story-Life of Napoleon," by Mr. 
Wayne Whipple, is a selection of anecdotes 
in regard to each succeeding incident or phase 
of Napoleon's career, so arranged as to form 
a biography. There is evidently room for such 
a book, and the only question concerns the 
method by which it is constructed. If the 
reader should inquire what reason he has to 
suppose any particular story to be true, the 
editor offers him no assistance, for the stories 
are quoted indiscriminately from memoirs and 
secondary works of all sorts, some of which 
have no other merit than a readable style. 
The collection would have been far more help- 
ful if the editor had traced the stories back 
to the original sources. They could still have 
been given in the most attractive English form 
available. A story may be worth telling, al- 
though apocryphal, as, for example, the 
story of Napoleon's smashing the porcelain 
vase during his negotiations with Cobenzl 
prior to the Peace of Campo Formio. This is 
still told as historical by so distinguished a 
historian as Fournier. The author quotes 
from Madame Junot's Memoirs the tale that 
at his coronation Napoleon seized the crown 
to prevent the pope from placing it on his 
head. This tale is disposed of by Frederick 
Masson in his recent work on the Coronation. 
The legend of the drowning of the Russians 
at Austerlitz is quoted from Emerson 's ' ' Rep- 
resentative Men ' ' ! 

In this group of books are two biographies 
of Napoleon, one a new edition of Viscount 
Wolseley's "Decline and Fall of Napoleon," 
published first in 1895, the other a "Life of 
Napoleon" by Major Arthur Griffiths. Wolse- 
ley's narrative opens with the campaign of 
1812, and is professedly a piece of military 
historical writing, especially interesting be- 
cause of its author's competence upon the 
questions involved. The biography by Major 
Griffiths deals with Napoleon's whole career. 
It is written in a vigorous style, interspersed 
with wholesome English denunciations of Na- 
poleon's conduct. It makes no compromise 
with the "New History," giving hardly more 
than allusions to the great constructive 
achievements of the Consulate and the Em- 
pire. The narrative is mainly concerned with 
political intrigue, diplomacy, and wars. It is 
brief, running only to the length of eighty 
thousand words. There are certain errors of 
statement which should be corrected. Young 
Napoleon Bonaparte did not "beat the streets 
of Paris" from May until October, 1792, 
hoping for reinstatement in the army. He

was reinstated with the rank of Captain on 
July 10, and his promotion was dated back to 
the preceding February. On his return from 
Egypt, Napoleon could not have "tried the 
Jacobin Club, ' ' because this had been closed by 
Fouche. Furthermore it is not true that the 
financial successes of the early Consulate were 
due mainly to exactions similar to those which 
characterized Napoleon's first Italian cam- 
paign. After all, these are minor blemishes; 
the chief question is the distribution of in- 
terest. The significance of Napoleon's career 
for France and for Europe is missed.

A HALF-FORGOTTEN AMERICAN 
PRESIDENT.* 



One would have expected an authorized 
biography of Rutherford B. Hayes long ago, 
as it is now twenty-two years since his death. 
His friend William Henry Smith had in fact 
begun such a work, but it was interrupted by 
the hand of death, in 1896. Mr. Smith's plan 
was an extended history of the time, woven 
about the life of Hayes. A part of his ma- 
terial was published some years after his 
death in the form of two large volumes on 
" The Political History of Slavery." On his 
death bed he had requested his son-in-law, 
Mr. Charles Richard Williams, to finish the 
task. Mr. Williams did not immediately find 
the time to fulfil this commission, but brought 
out the volumes on Slavery as a separate work, 
leaving the biography to be taken up by itself 
when opportunity should offer. Finding it 
possible to withdraw from other labor a few 
years ago, he set himself seriously at work 
upon the biography, which we now have be- 
fore us. 

It is safe to say that this change from Mr. 
Smith's original plan means a much wider 
reading for the biography. Indeed, the com- 
pression of the subject into a single volume 
would have had a decided advantage in this 
respect, but anyone who is aware of the em- 
barras des richesses which the author had at 
his disposal in the old Hayes mansion in Fre- 
mont will wonder only that he could have had 
the heart to practice a rigorous enough ex- 
clusion to keep within the limits of the two 
volumes here presented. Perhaps the Hayes 
Diary, drawn upon constantly for this work, 
may some day be published in its entirety. 
The Western Reserve Historical Society might 
find a useful field of endeavor here.

Frith of Tay, according to Holinshed, the 
Scots were hard beset and about to give way. 
Suddenly there appeared upon the scene a 
farmer named Haie, with his two sons. They 
had observed the plight of their countrymen 
from the field where they were at work, and 
grasping plough-beams in their hands they 
rushed upon the foe with such lusty vigor as 
to turn defeat into victory. "And the King 
gave them armes, three scutcheons gules in a 
field of silver, a plowbeame added thereunto 
which he used instead of a battell axe, when 
he fought so valiantlie in defense of his owne 
countrie. " Of this family President Hayes 
is said to have been a descendant. We know 
of no reason to doubt the connection, but it 
would have been of interest to the general 
reader to have had the evidence of it more 
fully stated. 

A third of a century has passed since the 
administration of President Hayes closed, des- 
tined to have its sharper features suddenly 
blurred in the public eye and dulled in the 
public consciousness by the shot of the assassin 
of his successor. That time has justified those 
features of his policy which brought the im- 
mediate wrath of a large section of his own 
party heavily upon his head is now the opinion 
of most students of the period whose views 
are worth considering. Few Americans would 
now tolerate the thought of bolstering up by 
federal bayonets a state government wholly 
unable to command the support or respect of 
any considerable portion of the educated and 
responsible citizenship of the state, as had 
been done in parts of the South for some years 
before Hayes entered upon his high office. 
The difficulty grew not out of the extension 
of the suffrage to the enfranchised negroes in 
itself, but out of the fact that the Republican 
Party of the time had not risen high enough 
to refrain from the temptation to organize this 
immense new body of ignorant and inexperi- 
enced voters into a solid partisan tool to be 
used by party manipulators against the 
southern whites. Hayes keenly realized the 
abhorrent conditions to which this unwisdom 
had led, and had the courage to withdraw the 
federal troops, which were the sole support of 
a number of wholly corrupt and inefficient 
Republican state "governments," in spite of 
the fact that this action was sure to be con- 
strued by many as impeaching his own title 
to the Presidency. For the same returning 
boards upon whose action his own title rested 
had declared these Republican state officers 
duly elected. 

In the opinion of the reviewer, the author's 
very extended account of the contested elec- 
tion is the least profitable part of his work. 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



263 



Much more readily than could have been ex- 
pected, the country settled down to the ac- 
ceptance of the verdict of the Electoral 
Commission as giving Hayes a legally unim- 
peachable title to the Presidency. The country 
realized that a certain amount of discretion 
had to be lodged in this Commission, and at 
no time was there the slightest danger of any 
forcible uprising against its decision. Of 
course it was only to be expected that thou- 
sands would feel that this discretion had not 
been rightly used, and that some would feel 
that it had been corruptly used. Thirty-eight 
years have passed; those most intensely in- 
terested have largely left the stage of life, and 
but little of the deep feeling of 1877 lingers. 
What good can there be in laboriously trying 
the whole question over again, attempting to 
prove what everybody knows, that there was 
Democratic intimidation of colored voters in 
the South; slurring over what is equally 
known, that there was wholesale Republican 
corruption in the same quarter; accusing 
Tilden of guilty knowledge of an attempt to 
secure an electoral vote by bribery, of which 
there is neither convincing proof nor inherent 
probability ; defending Hayes against the now 
forgotten charge of paying for electoral votes 
by appointment of certain election officers to 
federal positions, of which there is equally 
neither valid evidence nor inherent proba- 
bility! All this is only stirring up a smudge 
which tends to conceal the real greatness of a 
really great and good President, and was 
wholly unnecessary to the completeness of the 
work, except in the briefest epitome. 

President Hayes had many lovable traits of 
character. In the thick of the Civil War, with 
southern bullets flying about him and oc- 
casionally into him, he could write home to 
his wife deprecating untrue aspersions against 
the men of the South. His fundamental sense 
of right revolted against unnecessary destruc- 
tion of property in war, and the soldiers under 
him applied the torch only when he himself 
was constrained by written orders from su- 
perior authority. The later years of his life 
were marked by untiring devotion to Prison 
Reform and other philanthropic activities. 
His beautiful Fremont home was a centre of 
refined culture and high moral ideals, where 
men and women of the highest types of Ameri- 
can citizenship loved to gather. Our political 
evolutionists will perhaps tell us that he be- 
longs to a type irrevocably past; but it re- 
mains true that the politics of the day would 
lose nothing by a liberal infusion of some of 
his most prominent characteristics. And all 
this can be said, and should have been said by 
Mr. Williams, without casting any slur upon 



the ability and character of his opponent, 
Samuel J. Tilden, whose services to New York 
were those of a great and upright statesman 
and philanthropist. W. H. JOHNSON. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



The anonymity of so remarkable a novel as 
"Home," published about a year ago, could 
not long be preserved. It soon transpired that 
the author was Mr. George Agnew Chamber- 
lain, the occupant of a consular post in South 
America. This accounted for the exotic graft 
upon the homely New England stock which 
made the work of such enticing interest. Mr. 
Chamberlain's success has encouraged him to 
further production, in consequence whereof we 
now have "Through Stained Glass," a novel 
which fairly matches "Home" in charm and 
depth of human revelation. Here also, we 
skip somewhat breathlessly about the globe, 
from Virginia to South America, thence to 
London and Paris, and finally to New England. 
A Leighton of Virginia, after fighting for the 
Confederacy, seeks a new home for his family, 
and finds it in Brazil. Presently, a boy Leigh- 
ton of the northern branch is consigned to his 
care, and grows up in happy childish compan- 
ionship with his cousin Natalie. As he ap- 
proaches manhood, his father, who has been a 
wanderer over the face of the earth since the 
death of his wife in childbirth, seeks the boy 
out, and carries him off to Europe to make of 
him an artist and a gentleman. The boy is a 
perfect illustration of the way in which breed- 
ing will tell, for he fits into the ways of civiliza- 
tion without an effort, and knows by instinct 
how to do and say the right thing. For years 
the father and the son live in beautiful and 
devoted companionship, the former supplying 
the worldly wisdom of his sophisticated intel- 
lect illuminating life for the boy as 
"through stained glass" the son repaying 
this solicitude with affection, and preserving 
his own purity of soul while realizing his artis- 
tic self. He needs no curb to keep him from 
going astray, except in the one case of his 
infatuation for Miss Folly Delaires of the 
chorus, and here the father's persuasive tact 
scores a triumph. There is no blustering about 
it, or declared opposition, but simply a little 
subtle manceuvering to bring the boy to his 
senses, and just the touch of cynicism that is 
needed to open his eyes. In the end, there is 
Natalie, who has found a home in New En- 
gland, and has never ceased to hope for her

cousin-playmate's return. The love story is 
very tenderly and delicately managed; it 
leaves far more to the imagination than it ex- 
presses, which is the way of all true art. The 
action of this novel extends so widely over 
time and space that it is perforce swift, and 
its jerky movement hurries us on where we 
would gladly linger, but it tingles with vitality 
and glows with beauty on well-nigh every 
page. 

"The Secret of the Reef," the latest novel 
by Mr. Harold Bindloss, is written upon the 
stereotyped model with which his readers are 
familiar. There is an energetic and courage- 
ous hero, down on his luck, a heroine toward 
whom he aspires, and a villain who endeavors 
to thwart him in his efforts to win love and 
fortune. This villain is none other than the 
heroine's father, which provides material for 
a conflict between romantic and filial love on 
the part of a high-souled maiden. There is 
never any doubt as to which love will come out 
ahead. The story is concerned with the sal- 
vage of a wrecked treasure ship, sunk on a reef 
in the Alaskan far north. The author has 
abundant knowledge of his material, but there 
is little of either imagination or literary grace 
in the telling of his story. 

Time was when a novel by the Castles con- 
noted joyous adventure and the very spring- 
tide poetry of romance. But to " The Haunted 
Heart" we can ascribe no such qualities. The 
delicate sentiment that we used to find in their 
work has become coarse and treacly; the col- 
oring is garish, and emotion is strained to the 
breaking point. In the slang of a bygone gen- 
eration, this is a novel for which ' ' too utterly 
utter" offers the only adequate description. 
Moreover, it makes a frank bid for cheap popu- 
larity by depicting the smart set in London 
society with the pencil of the caricaturist, 
much as Mr. Chambers describes the corre- 
sponding abscess in our American social 
organism. The heart which is here haunted is 
that of the Master of Stronaven, whose wife, 
after fifteen years of devotion, discovers an 
early lapse from virtue on the part of her hus- 
band, and runs away from him with an Italian 
artist. After cooling his rage by smashing the 
furniture, the deserted husband goes lion- 
shooting in Africa, and returns to England a 
few months later with the fixed intention of 
marrying the first attractive girl he meets, in 
order to show the errant divorced wife that he 
does n 't care. The match is soon found in the 
person of an heiress, the daughter of an un- 
speakably vulgar and snobbish parvenue from 
the Argentine, and Ian weds her, while love for 
the vanished Morna is still gnawing at his 
heart. The spooks prove too much for this 



heart, which breaks down after a few months 
of re-wedded life, and the former sharer of his 
couch comes post haste from her Italian villa 
just in time to apprise him before his death 
that she is sorry for her precipitate desertion, 
and that she has been his in spirit all the time. 
His brother, the Catholic priest, although 
overmuch given to moralizing, is the most sym- 
pathetic figure in this hectic work of fiction. 
WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

It is a pleasant story that Mr. W. Pett Ridge 
has written in "The Happy Recruit" (Doran), 
which tells of a small German boy in London, 
orphaned and left with a baby sister while still in 
school. He grows to manhood and a wished-for 
marriage in the progress of the narrative; and 
his career, from its humble beginnings as a waiter 
and boy-of -all-work in a cheap hotel to the propri- 
etorship of a successful eating-house, really tells 
the well-to-do and prosperous how the other half 
becomes so. That a German should be given so 
affectionate a history by an Englishman is doubly 
grateful in these days of international hatreds. 
The book has abundant humor. 

The biography of a woman is set forth in much 
detail by Mrs. Alice Birkhead in " Destiny's 
Daughter " (Lane) . The heroine inherits ability 
and an unusual type of good looks with nothing 
else. Sacrificing a good match for the sake of a 
younger sister, she is compelled to earn her living. 
Failing as a schoolmistress, she becomes private 
secretary to a self-made manufacturer with par- 
liamentary aspirations, a widower with grown chil- 
dren. His proposal drives her to the stage, for 
which she had early shown aptitude, and the slow 
path to success is courageously climbed. The end 
of the story is a surprise, almost a shock; but the 
foundation for it has been well laid nevertheless. 

To be able to write a story with sound historic 
foundations that reads far better than any of the 
dreadful trash which passes current among many 
boys, is an achievement to be proud of. Mr. Zane 
Grey has done this in " The Lone Star Ranger " 
(Harper), which is dedicated to the gallant body 
of men whose bravery and usefulness it records. 
Half the stirring tale is devoted to the manner in 
which Buckley Duane is driven by inheritance and 
environment into outlawry; the other half deals 
with his rehabilitation under the law as a Texas 
Ranger. Except for a chapter or two near the 
denouement, the record is as limpid as the story 
itself is turbulent, making a glorified and respect- 
able " dime novel." 

Philadelphia society, assuredly not at its best, 
figures exclusively in Mrs. Therese Tyler's " The 
Dusty Road" (Lippincott). The heroine is an 
ambitious girl, brought up in genteel poverty by a 
mother whose life is spent in maintaining her 
social position in the face of huge discouragements. 
The girl is not socially ambitious, but longs for 
better things. In the progress of the story she has 
several lovers. One she treats with youthful in- 



1915]

tolerance. Another she dallies with until the reader 
almost loses sympathy for her, so much of a brute 
is he. At the end she finds her mate, rather to 
everybody's surprise his, her own, and also the 
reader's. The work is styled realistic, here syno- 
nymous with disagreeable. It certainly upsets the 
prevalent idea that Philadelphia is u slow." 

Miss Elsie Singmaster has again dealt with the 
Pennsylvania Germans whom she knows and loves 
so well, in "Katy Gaumer" (Houghton), a simple 
tale of a young girl who finds her heart's desire 
after long wandering. Under the love story lies an 
even more absorbing current, based on the silence 
of a good man who has been led by one crime into 
making a blunder; and who allows an innocent 
man's life to be ruined under accusation of crime. 
The book is truly an interpretation of a people 
who are a real part of American life, yet have kept 
old-country ways and habits of thought through 
generations of residence among us. With the 
knowledge given of them in such books as this, 
even this strangeness is bound to disappear. 

The Philippines have produced an unusual novel 
in Mr. Walter Elwood's " Guimo " (ReiUy & Brit- 
ton), which deals with the misfortunes of a young 
half-caste, the illegitimate son of a Spanish priest 
and a native woman, who lends his name to the 
book. There is much local color, laid on with a 
palette knife by the use on every page of native 
terms and native legends and superstitions; but 
the writer seems really to have penetrated below 
the surface of an inexorably alien people and to 
disclose something of their thoughts and aspira- 
tions. Tragedy runs through the narrative to its 
close. Such a book, could it obtain wide circula- 
tion, would have a beneficent effect upon the people 
of the United States, and might interest them a 
little in their far Eastern possessions. 

The title of Mr. E. F. Benson's new novel, 
" Arundel " (Doran), is the name of the country 
place inhabited by two of his characters, a widowed 
mother and a marriageable daughter. Next door 
lives an eligible young man, a broker by occupa- 
tion, but with a sincere love for and appreciation 
of music, poor performer though he is. The story 
opens in India, where the greatly loved daughter 
of an army officer, is about to leave him and her 
step -mother, to visit his sister, the lady of Arun- 
del. She, too, is a musician, and such a performer 
as the young man wishes himself to be. When she 
arrives her cousin and the broker are already be- 
trothed, one of those calm engagements based 
upon propinquity rather than passion. Music 
opens new vistas, and brings about a tense situa- 
tion which is only to be solved by the rather 
awkward expedient of death. The narrative is 
unusually well written, but others of Mr. Benson's 
stories have been better contrived. 

" Mrs. Martin's Man " (Macmillan) is the skil- 
ful work of Mr. St. John G. Ervine, who will be 
remembered for several plays produced in this 
country by the Irish Players. His novel, like these 
plays, has its scene near and in the Ulster metrop- 
olis of Belfast, and deals with Irish Protestants. 
Before the tale closes he places his protagonist, 
Mrs. Martin, in as difficult a position as can well 
be imagined either for sister, wife, or mother. 



Without much schooling, with no help from kins- 
folk, relying little upon religion, she nevertheless 
wins her peace and solves her intricate problems 
by the exercise of common sense and a pragmatic 
philosophy which leave nothing to be desired. The 
character drawing is minute and striking; the 
entire conception is dramatic and powerful; and 
the leading character affords an example of human- 
ness which may well be emulated. Social problems 
disappear in the face of an individuality as well 
balanced as Mrs. Martin's. 

Dartmoor is beloved of English novelists, and 
few have touched it without commending it to their 
readers. Mr. John Trevena is one of the best 
known of these fiction writers, and his latest story 
of the hills and moors, " Sleeping Waters " (Ken- 
nerley), is a work of unusual fascination, as re- 
mote from the affairs of every-day living as poetry 
and imagination can make it. A Roman priest, 
stricken in health, is sent by a wealthy parishioner 
to the home of his ancestors, after having been 
regaled with local and family superstitions and 
traditions. He drinks of the waters of a spring 
which brings forgetfulness, apparently when fully 
convalescent, in reality while still in a sub-species 
of delirium. What follows is melodramatic, almost 
medisevally so, in the telling. A beautiful maiden, 
the spirit of the moors incarnate, wins him from 
his priestly vows, and in his attempt to gain her 
he fights all sorts of queer persons, a scoundrelly 
lawyer, a tool of a physician, a crazed and drunken 
mother, an ignorant tenantry steeped in its folly, 
and the elements themselves. The close of the 
book makes all sound and well again, though the 
priest renounces his church to gain a real love, 
shadowed at the book's opening. 

Mr. Booth Tarkington has written a vital criti- 
cism of American life in its bustling cities, and has 
called it, aptly enough, " The Turmoil" (Harper). 
Where others have attacked moral, political, eco- 
nomic, and racial problems, he has taken aBsthetic 
ground, and has objected to our national quest for 
Bigness and its ensuing consequences as being in 
bad taste. He takes a family of father, mother, 
sister, and three brothers, every one of whom 
has lived with little knowledge of the amenities, 
either at home or abroad. But they would 
not be American if they had not some aspira- 
tions. The father has made his fortune, built him 
a mansion in a somewhat fashionable neighbor- 
hood, and the family looks about for social con- 
nections. Next their new house live people of 
better position than themselves, but now reduced 
to grinding poverty; and the only child of the 
house, a daughter, conceives it to be her duty to 
her parents to marry one of the unmarried sons 
of the rich neighbors. The repellent sordidness 
of her procedure, baffled once by accidental death 
and an awakening of conscience, is reconciled with 
decency at the end of the book. Mr. Tarkington 
succeeds in making the story not only eminently 
readable and a model of constructive ability, but 
he keeps his readers in sympathy with all his char- 
acters, so humanly are they depicted and devel- 
oped. But it is curious to note how carefully the 
moral element is eliminated in the process. Its 
lesson is given by indirection.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



That Mr. John Jay Chapman 
Miscellanies deserves to be called a humanist, 

of a humanist. . . 

not in the restricted Petrarchian 
sense of the term, nor indeed in the peculiar 
meaning attached to the word by Professor 
Schiller, but with the larger connotations it 
carries with it in current speech, is abun- 
dantly proved, if proof were needed, by his 
latest book, "Memories and Milestones" (Mof- 
fat, Yard & Co.), which is issued in the 
conviction that the putting forth of such col- 
lections of personal reminiscence and more or 
less ripe reflection "helps the general atmos- 
phere of thought and enriches everyone a 
little." "With brief but carefully considered 
and always scholarly talks on art and ethical 
culture, on modern drama and the negro ques- 
tion, on William James and Horace Howard 
Furness and Julia "Ward Howe, he both re- 
veals the range of his own interests and sympa- 
thies and opens to the reader many new and 
inviting vistas of speculation and inquiry. 
Like William James, whose portrait serves 
as frontispiece to the book, and whose person- 
ality inspires one of its most readable chapters, 
Mr. Chapman is perhaps even more suggestive 
than expressive ; but he seems not quite to have 
done justice to James's genius in asserting 
of him that "he had not the gift of expression, 
but rather the gift of suggestion." Nearer 
the truth would it be to say of that master of 
apt and original epithet, of brilliantly illumi- 
nating phrase or idiom, that he had both the 
gift of expression and, in a still greater degree, 
the gift of suggestion. A chapter on Har- 
vard's distinguished and still active ex-presi- 
dent uses throughout the obituary past tense. 
Was the article "released" prematurely? 
Certainly its very opening sentence, ' ' For half 
a century President Eliot was one of the great 
personal figures in American life," with all 
that follows, carries implications that fortu- 
nately are not yet true. In his discussion of 
"Shaw and the Modern Drama" the author 
shows himself fair-minded and not unappre- 
ciative of Mr. Shaw's undeniable genius, but 
a little severe in his opinion that ' ' Shaw wants 
merely to get heard of and to make money ' ' 
as if such a purpose were not sure, in the very 
nature of things, to defeat its own ends. 
Bather, one might venture to say, Mr. Shaw is 
immensely interested in his own ideas, in the 
kaleidoscopic oddity of aspect that the world 
presents to him ; after that the money and the 
fame are probably not unwelcome. But Mr. 
Chapman wins assent when he continues: 
"You cannot say he is a man without heart: 
he is the kindliest of men. But he is a man 
without taste or reverence. He does not know 



that there are things which cannot be made 
funny. He is a man in whose composition 
something is left out. You cannot blame him, 
any more than you can blame the color-blind. 
He is beauty-blind, and amuses himself with 
seeing what grotesques he can pick out of the 
carpet of life. ' ' The author takes occasion to 
say a good word, and a needed word, for the 
study of the classics, more particularly of 
Greek, "as a pleasure," both in school and 
after school; but he errs in calling Caesar's 
"Commentaries" the "dullest book in Latin." 
That is the schoolboy's natural misconception. 
There are many Latin books, especially of 
post-classical authorship, that far exceed 
Cassar in dulness, if Caesar be dull. Now and 
then a misspelled foreign word, as Zeitgheist 
and the unpluralized first element in morceau 
choisis, disfigures Mr. Chapman's scholarly 
page. Portraits of Dr. Furness, Mrs. Howe, 
and Charles Eliot Norton, to the last-named 
of whom he devotes one of his best chapters of 
mingled reminiscence and characterization 
and suggestive observation, find appropriate 
place in the volume, in addition to the portrait 
of James already mentioned. The book is the 
best of its sort that has yet come from its 
author's pen. 



Defects and mos t recent of Mr. Frederic 

possibilities of C. Howe 's three or four books 

the modern city. Qn municipa l affairg bearg the 

ambitious and alluring title, "The Modern 
City and its Problems" (Scribner). In an 
earlier volume of the series Mr. Howe has 
developed with much ingenuity the thesis that 
in the city lies the hope of democratic institu- 
tions, and in another book he has described 
concretely the conduct of municipal activities 
in Great Britain and Germany. In the pres- 
ent work he traverses ground considerably 
more extended. Almost every Division of the 
subject, historical and descriptive, which re- 
ceives attention in the text-books is accorded 
a chapter, and the more recently developed 
problems of municipal administration, such as 
city planning, housing, and recreation, are 
dealt with in considerable detail. Both Ameri- 
can and European cities come within the scope 
of the survey. Mr. Howe is ready enough to 
admit, as most people are, that the American 
city "lags behind the work it should properly 
perform, ' ' that it is " negative in its functions 
rather than positive in its services," and that 
"it has so little concern for its people that 
they in turn have little concern for it. ' ' And 
his views concerning the cause of this state of 
affairs and its remedy are rather out of the 
ordinary. The difficulty, he believes, is not 
to be sought in the character of the American 



1915]

people, or in their supposed neglectful atti- 
tude toward politics and their tolerance of 
evil. It is only an assumption, he maintains, 
that they have willingly abdicated their re- 
sponsibilities and turned the city over to the 
professional politician as an easy escape from 
the burdens which its management imposes. 
The conditions of neglect, partisanship, and 
tolerance of evil which exist are declared to 
be traceable back to legal institutions, to con- 
stitutional and political limitations under 
which the people are compelled to work in 
municipal affairs. The remedy lies in less 
rather than more restraint, greater rather 
than less municipal activity. "These condi- 
tions can only be corrected by a programme of 
city building, of city service, through com- 
pulsory co-operation, or socialization. To this 
co-operation there are no set limits. For many 
years to come the city will continue to increase 
its activities and enlarge its services. This is 
the lesson of the past ; it is the promise of the 
future." Mr. Howe writes, as he remarks, 
from the inside of the city. From the time 
when, a good many years ago, he saw active 
service in the city council and on the finance 
commission of Cleveland until his recent ap- 
pointment as commissioner of immigration at 
New York, his tasks have fallen where the 
problems of the city loom largest. Whatever 
he writes bears the stamp of experience and 
of conviction, and is, in addition, eminently 
readable. Inevitably one who writes so frankly 
for the casual reader falls into errors of gen- 
eralization. Thus, Mr. Howe is led to make 
the somewhat astonishing remark that even 
to-day civilization in the rural districts "does 
not progress beyond its simplest forms." But 
the fault is one which can be overlooked by 
any one who cares for fresh, vigorous, and 
stimulating writing on a subject of vital 
present-day importance. 



About one-third of the 333 
tSS, P a ges of Mr. Willard Hunting- 
ton "Wright's "What Nietzsche 
Taught" (Huebsch) is devoted to the life of 
the philosopher and the genesis of his works, 
and the rest to excerpts from the works. It 
is a helpful book for the beginner who ap- 
proaches Nietzsche with the query that will 
not down : What did he say ? It is not a 
criticism, but a presentation ; and as such it is 
excellent, despite a few inaccuracies. Fr. W. 
Ritschl did not "found the science of his- 
torical literary criticism as we know it to- 
day" (page 27), but the Schlegels; though 
Nietzsche meant the Fall of Wagner by his 
"Der Fall Wagner," it is altogether wrong to 
translate the title in this way (page 38) ; 



Nietzsche's friend was Malvidavon Meysenbug 
not "Mysenburg" (page 41) ; Vauvenargues 
would not recognize himself as "Vanergues" 
(page 45) ; Nietzsche's etymologies of bonus 
and bellum have not been unreservedly ac- 
cepted (page 207) ; and Mr. H. L. Mencken, 
to whom the volume is dedicated, has not 
been "the critic who has given the greatest 
impetus to the study of Nietzsche in this coun- 
try," that was done by the separate intro- 
ductions to the various translations published 
in this country by Messrs. Macmillan, and by 
the works of Halevy, Kennedy, and Miigge. 
There are three contentions, on the other 
hand, that are irrefutable : to know Nietzsche 
in part he must be studied as a whole ; there 
are no important contradictions in his philoso- 
phy; and he has had, next to Kant, the 
greatest influence on the development of mod- 
ern thought. It is difficult to think to-day 
apart from Nietzsche; he expressed himself 
on every subject. What he says may not be 
pleasant ; it does not lull to ease, but arouses 
to action. On this account a careful selection 
of his commitments on burning questions is 
valuable. We may look in vain for some of 
our most cherished apothegms, and we may 
find others that strike us as negligible: but 
on the whole, we find enough to make us 
think, and that is a vast deal. Just as one 
should begin the study of Nietzsche's works 
with "Human, All too Human," so could one 
most advantageously undertake the study of 
Nietzsche with Mr. Wright's volume. Besides 
containing the essential facts of the great 
Yea-Say er's life, it contains also the greatest 
truths he expressed during his life. Each of 
the former may be a blind alley that leads 
nowhere ; but each of the latter has a horizon- 
widening quality that is most invigorating. 
"The symbol of the modern soul," Nietzsche 
says, "is the labyrinth." True, and he has 
thrown out a number of life-lines by which 
we may work our way through it. The 
strongest of these are contained in this book, 
which has also a bibliography compiled with 
common-sense. 

Mr. Chesterton 's opinion of Ger-

is no secret to the world at large, 
and the vehement expression of that opinion 
as contained in the little book entitled "The 
Appetite of Tyranny" (Dodd) will give no 
shock of surprise to anyone who has been for 
the past few months even a hasty reader of 
the daily hodge-podge of intelligence and mis- 
intelligence printed by the newspaper press 
concerning the great war. It is his "Barbar- 
ism of Berlin" and "Letters to an Old Gari- 
baldian" that are brought within the covers

THE DIAL 



[ April 1 



of the above-named book, which shows its bril- 
liant author in highly characteristic vein 
as, indeed, what writing from his pen does 
not? and inevitably reveals some of the 
faults inseparable from such astonishing clev- 
erness of intellect and enviable facility of 
expression. The excellence of the book lies 
in its forceful and original and convincing 
demonstration of that quality of German mili- 
tarism (and in fact of all militarism, though 
the limitation is not removed) which Mr. 
Chesterton chooses to call barbarism, and 
which indicates, not an insufficiency of twen- 
tieth-century civilization, such as, with some 
reason, may be urged in dispraise of the 
Russians, but a ruthless disregard of certain 
fundamental principles that cannot be sacri- 
ficed without plunging us all back into chaos 
and black night. The less praiseworthy fea- 
ture of the book is found in its unsparing 
vehemence of invective, in its author's allow- 
ing himself to be carried away by his own 
momentum, as when he writes : "So strongly 
do the instincts of the Prussian drive against 
liberty, that he would rather oppress other 
people's subjects than think of anybody going 
without the benefits of oppression. He is a 
sort of disinterested despot. He is as disinter- 
ested as the devil who is ready to do any one's 
dirty work." In further illustration of the 
books tone, let this be added: "Wherever 
the most miserable remnant of our race, astray 
and dried up in deserts, or buried forever 
under the fall of bad civilizations, has some 
feeble memory that men are men, that bar- 
gains are bargains, that there are two sides to 
a question, or even that it takes two to make a 
quarrel that remnant has the right to resist 
the New Culture, to the knife and club and 
splintered stone. For the Prussian begins all 
his culture by that act which is the destruction 
of all creative thought and constructive action. 
He breaks that mirror in the mind, in which a 
man can see the face of his friend or foe." 
The two parts of the book are essentially one in 
purpose and manner, and both are eminently 
and brilliantly Chestertonian. 



Some new 
memorials of 
the Brownings. 



The announcement of a volume 
of "New Poems by Robert 
Browning and Elizabeth Bar- 
rett Browning" (Macmillan) must have been 
hailed with joyful anticipation by thousands 
of Browning lovers. Something of the old 
thrill many of us recall upon the appearance 
of "Ferishtah's Fancies," "Asolando," or 
"Aurora Leigh" stirred again, together with 
a vague hope that by some good fortune 
something equally momentous might have 
been unearthed even at this late day. Let us 



not be too ungrateful, even though this some- 
what unreasonable hope has not been fulfilled ; 
let us be glad that we can add twenty-nine 
poems to our "complete editions" of Robert 
Browning and six to those of Mrs. Browning. 
There will be a difference of opinion as to the 
righteousness of these addenda, a doubt 
whether it is just to a poet to rake his desk, 
after he has gone, for what he has himself 
discarded. Seldom indeed does his poetical 
reputation gain by such a proceeding; never- 
theless when these discarded works are put 
up for sale at public auction, as many of the 
present collections were two years ago, it 
seems only decently respectful to beloved 
memories to rescue them from almost certain 
loss or annihilation. In the present volume 
notes have been added by such competent 
hands as those of Messrs. Frederic G. Kenyon. 
Bertram Dobell, and Edmund Gosse, telling 
all that is known of the literary or biblio- 
graphical history of the poems. Perhaps the 
chief interest, however, will be found in some 
thirty-five pages of criticisms written by 
Elizabeth Barrett to her future husband on 
his submitting to her in manuscript certain 
of his poems. "Saul" and "Luria" are two 
of the poems which seem to have received her 
special care, and one has only to compare the 
lines as first written with their present form 
to realize how much they gain by the sensitive 
and sensible suggestions. We discover some- 
thing quite contradictory to the accepted tra- 
dition that each worked entirely independent 
of the other. A reproduction of the earliest 
known portrait of Browning, made from an 
old daguerreotype, and one of Elizabeth Bar- 
rett from a miniature painting, are the sole 
illustrations. 



An optimist 
in the 
Far East. 



A travel-book which shows un- 
usual sympathy and insight is 
Mr. Clayton Sedgwick Cooper's 
"The Modernizing of the Orient" (McBride, 
Nast & Co.). It is the result of two world- 
journeyings, and its chapters deal with condi- 
tions in North Africa, Egypt, India, Burma, 
China, the Philippines, and Japan. Descrip- 
tive passages are not infrequent, but Mr. 
Cooper was most interested in the social, edu- 
cational, and religious "modernizing" which 
is now in process throughout the once "un- 
changing East. ' ' In gathering his information 
he was catholic and judicious, so that he is 
able to present not only the views of Western 
officials and missionaries, but also of thought- 
ful natives. The chapters on educational 
progress in Egypt, India, China, and Japan, 
on religious transformation in India and 
Burma, and on social changes in India, are 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



269 



very suggestive. A prevailing note is that of 
optimism. Although he visited China just 
before the ill-starred counter-revolution, yet 
he believes the Chinese "will bring victory 
out of defeat in accordance with their im- 
memorial habit of stumbling along through 
chaos to order, accomplishing often the seem- 
ingly impossible." And a sympathetic ap- 
preciation of the good points of the eastern 
peoples is constantly manifest, the Filipinos 
alone proving a disappointment, but then the 
chapter on the Philippines is in itself dis- 
appointing. In matters of opinion, although 
Mr. Cooper will not have all the authorities on 
his side, yet he will find very general support 
for his statements. Errors in fact are sur- 
prisingly few : ' ' five hundred lakhs ' ' are con- 
siderably more than "one-half million," and 
a new definition would be necessary in order 
to show that ninety per cent of the people of 
India are agricultural. There are, also, a few 
typographical errors, such as Banio, Morro, 
Mindano, for Baguio, Moro, and Mindanao. 



The play 
that won 
$10,000. 



Apple-trees and larkspur and 
lilacs in bloom, shimmering 
gowns and rose-trimmed bonnets 
of an older time, sap mounting and everything 
breaking bounds because of springtime and 
love in New England, all this adds charm 
to the graceful manner in which Miss Alice 
Brown has presented her theme in the play, 
' ' Children of Earth ' ' (Macmillan) . The story 
is that of Mary Ellen, whom Peter Hale per- 
suades that nothing else matters but love 
not even Jane, the drunken gypsy wife who 
has long been to him as one that is dead. 
Resolved to live their own lives, the two steal 
away; unexpectedly Jane's grief at their 
going clouds their radiant and belated day of 
spring. They return to do what is "right," 
the three resuming their neighborly duties as 
though the incident had never been. This is 
beautiful, perhaps; but it is not life. Did 
Miss Brown's idealism cause her to forget at 
the end that her characters are children of 
earth? What if Jane's nature is still unsub- 
dued? Or if Peter wavers some day when 
impulse and passion catch noble resolve on 
the rebound ? Or if Mary Ellen herself either 
revolts, in a moment of wild abandon, against 
the instinct of imprisoning her emotions for- 
ever, or else lives to witness the slow and 
sordid death, for want of expression, of what 
she believed was love ? The days to come will 
bring forth the real struggle, a struggle 
poignant, intense; not even the restriction of 
the sub-title, "a play of New England," con- 
vinces of the contrary. This struggle, together 
with a solution, whatever it may be, the author 



has evaded and has missed thereby the oppor- 
tunity for a powerful dramatic appeal, with- 
out which the crux of the story is merely an 
episode requiring one act for its presentation 
instead of four. The conventional ending 
would show Mary Ellen going away. Since 
she stays, we demand another glimpse of these 
strong characters to reveal whether they stand 
or bend or break. There are promises here of 
a something which justifies Mr. Winthrop 
Ames in the belief that his ten-thousand dollar 
prize was wisely awarded. As it is, however, 
the play is incomplete. It does not satisfy. 
And, after all, should not all art, as George 
Gissing suggested, be "an expression, satisfy- 
ing and abiding, of the zest of life"? 



BRIEFERJKENTION. 

Nothing new by way of praise or dispraise can 
be said of the English "Who's Who" for 1915 
(Macmillan) which carries the volume to the sixty- 
seventh year of issue and usefulness. There are 
now 250,000 biographies included, together with 
additional current information, within its 2500 
pages. And still the dimensions remain prac- 
ticable. 

The issue in attractive form and pocket size of 
" Woman and War," a chapter reprinted from Mrs. 
Olive Schreiner's " Woman and Labor," deserves 
mention, even amid the present deluge of war lit- 
erature. While much that is produced to-day is 
ephemeral, this essay, written a dozen odd years 
ago, still stands among the most distinctive and 
forceful condemnations of war of our day. Messrs. 
Stokes are the publishers. 

"The Elements of the Short Story," by Pro- 
fessor Edward Everett Hale, Jr., and Mr. Fred- 
erick T. Dawson, is an eminently sane and useful 
book. While most editors of recent collections of 
short stories have striven for novelties in the way 
of translations and selections from recent magazine 
literature, Messrs. Hale and Dawson have had the 
courage to confine themselves to the best and best- 
known work of a half-dozen American authors 
whose reputations have been tried by time. The 
illustrations of various types of story are well 
chosen; and the editorial matter, while slight in 
amount, is pointed and suggestive. (Holt.) 

Dr. Frederick Tupper and Dr. James W. Tup- 
per have chosen a dozen plays for the volume 
whose title explains their selection, " Represen- 
tative English Dramas from Dryden to Sheridan " 
(Oxford Press). The inclusion of " She Stoops to 
Conquer," "The Rivals," and "The School for 
Scandal" is necessary no doubt, on the score of 
completeness; although these plays can be ob- 
tained in numerous satisfactory editions for a mere 
two-pence. By restricting the period covered, the 
editors might instead have used the space for some 
of the more inaccessible plays, in fact, those 
from the very authors whose omission is referred 
to with regret in the introductory note. The 
bibliography and the notes at the end of the vol- 
ume are excellent in every way.

NOTES. 



" The Chronicles of the Imp " is the title of Mr. 
Jeffery Farnol's forthcoming novel. 

Mrs. Mary Roberts Rinehart's new novel, " K," 
will be published in the summer by the Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

" Fidelity " by Miss Susan Glaspell is a novel 
which Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. have in train 
for publication this month. 

Mr. Frank Swinnerton's critical study of Robert 
Louis Stevenson is ready and will be issued imme- 
diately by Mr. Mitchell Kennerley. 

M. Emile Verhaeren has written a new book of 
verse, " La Belgique Sanglante," inspired by the 
part Belgium has played in the war. 

An appreciation of Mr. Edward Carpenter and 
his teaching, from the pen of an intimate frien'd, 
Mr. Edward Lewis, will appear immediately. 

The first book General Friedrich von Bernhardi 
has written since the war broke out is " Germany 
and England," which will be published before long 
by Messrs. G. W. Dillinghain Co. 

Mr. John Masefield has written a book called 
" John M. Synge : A Few Personal Recollections, 
with Biographical Notes," which will be published 
in May by the Cuala Press, of Dublin. 

" The Invisible Event," the final volume of Mr. 
J. D. Beresford's trilogy of novels dealing with the 
life of Jacob Stahl, has just been published in 
England and will undoubtedly be issued in this 
country before long. 

Among forthcoming additions to the " Oxford 
Standard Authors " will be " The Arabian Nights : 
A Selection," with illustrations by Millais, Hough- 
ton, Pin well, and others ; and Kingsley's " Hypa- 
tia," illustrated by Mr. By am Shaw. 

A volume of verse by Lord Curzon of Kedleston, 
entitled " War Songs and other Translations," is 
announced by the John Lane Co. This house will 
also publish shortly, " Ventures in Thought," a vol- 
ume of essays by Mr. Francis Coutts. 

Readers of the brilliant essays contributed to 
THE DIAL for many years past by Mr. Charles 
Leonard Moore will be glad to know that a selec- 
tion of these will appear during the early autumn 
in a volume to be published by Messrs. Putnam. 

Mr. H. S. Souttar, one of the surgeons in charge 
of the British Field Hospital, describes his recent 
experiences in Malines, Termonde, and Ypres in a 
volume entitled "A Surgeon in Belgium," which 
will be issued immediately by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green & Co. 

As American agents for the Cambridge Univer- 
sity Press, Messrs. Putnam will shortly publish an 
essay on " Alexander Scott, Montgomerie, and 
Drummond of Hawthornden as Lyric Poets," by 
Catharine M. Maclean. The essay gained the Lord 
Rector's Prize in Edinburgh University in 1911-12. 

The novels of Godwin, Holcroft, and their circle 
as source-books on the life and thought of their 
time are discussed in a volume entitled " The 
French Revolution and the English Novel," by 
Allene Gregory, which Messrs. Putnam have nearly 



ready. The author contrasts the works in question 
with anti-Revolutionary fiction in England at the 
same period, also devoting a chapter to the novels 
expressing the early feminism of Mary Wollstone- 
craft. 

The English and American rights in Sir Sven 
Hedin's " With the German Armies in the West " 
have been acquired by Mr. John Lane, and the 
volume will appear within the next month or two. 
The author had unusual opportunities for seeing 
things behind the German lines and writes from the 
German point of view. 

Mr. Edward Hutton has written a study, based 
on contemporary authorities, of the attack of Attila 
upon civilization in the fifth century, and its de- 
feat on the plain of Chalons, as well as its relation 
to the Great War of the present day. The book 
will be published during the spring under the title 
of "Attila and the Huns." 

Professor George M. Wrong, of the University 
of Toronto, has written a series of papers on " The 
War Spirit of Germany," which the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press is bringing out immediately as a 
pamphlet. Mr. Edward Carpenter's essays on the 
war, under the title of " The Healing of Nations," 
announced some weeks ago, are expected almost 
immediately. 

New Rochelle's new library building has now 
seen a year of use, and the librarian reports an 
encouraging activity in the various departments 
of the institution. Here is a significant scrap from 
her annual record: "A review of the year's work 
shows a marked tendency toward sociological study 
and investigation. Several people have been aided 
in the production of books, and in one case the 
location of an obscure town in England was the 
means of establishing communication with the 
beneficiary of a will, an instance of the practical 
value of reference work." 

A new language, that of the Esquimaux, has just 
gained a place in the world of books through the 
medium of a volume called " Singnagtugag " in 
English, " The Dream," written by an Esquimau 
clergyman, and published in Greenland in his na- 
tive tongue. The author, Mathias Storch, is the 
son of a seal-hunter in the far North, and his book 
records incidents and impressions .of his boyhood 
which throw much fresh light on the customs of the 
Esquimaux. A Danish correspondent of the Lon- 
don " Nation," who has examined the book, states 
that it has a distinct ironic vein which finds ex- 
pression in the conclusion a dream of a self - 
governed Greenland two hundred years hence. 

Dr. Charles R. Henderson, professor of sociology 
in the University of Chicago, criminologist, author, 
lecturer, and for many years past a valued con- 
tributor to THE DIAL, died at Charleston, S. C., on 
March 29. He was born in 1848, at Covington, 
Ind. Ordained a minister in 1873, he accepted the 
pastorate of the Baptist Church first in Terre 
Haute, then in Detroit, and in 1892 became chap- 
lain of the University of Chicago. At the time of 
his death he was head of the department of prac- 
tical sociology in the University, associate editor 
of the "American Journal of Sociology," and pres- 
ident of the United Charities of Chicago. His

first-hand investigations and work in behalf of the 
oppressed and unemployed in Chicago and else- 
where established for him an international reputa- 
tion as a sympathetic student of humanity. His 
writings reveal a rare scholarship and cover a wide 
range in the field of sociology, dealing, more specif- 
ically, with the study of crime, treatment of delin- 
quent and defective classes, prisons and prison 
reform, and modern methods of charity. 

" The Nations' Histories " is the title of a new 
series of historical manuals which will be launched 
during the present season. The volumes will differ 
from other histories in the attention given to phys- 
ical and topographical features in determining the 
development of the different European nations, and 
to the archaeological and architectural remains 
which are the standing monuments of past achieve- 
ment. Each volume will contain an appendix giv- 
ing the present state of the country in full detail. 
The first three to be published are as follows: 
"Russia" by Dr. Harold W. Williams, "Ger- 
many " by Mr. W. T. Waugh, and " Poland " by 
Mr. G. E. Slocombe. 

A book of whimsical philosophy and banter, 
" with an ambiguous introduction by H. G. Wells," 
will shortly be published in England under the title 
of " Boon, the Mind of the Race, the Last Asses of 
the Devil, and the Last Trump," described as being 
" the table-talk of a deceased literary man, with 
some fragments of his unpublished works," com- 
piled by his executor, Reginald Bliss. George 
Boon, " the author of irreproachable novels of 
world-wide fame," is apparently not so much dead 
as missing. These literary remains of the vanished 
author are published as a sort of satirical com- 
jnentary upon the times, and especially upon the 
book world of to-day. 

Twenty-one new volumes are to be added at once 
to " Everyman's Library " by Messrs. Dutton. 
Among them are Professor Dowden's " Life of 
Robert Browning," the second volume of Froude's 
" Short Studies," Dostoevsky's " ' Poor Folk ' and 
' The Gambler,' " translated by Mr. C. J. Hogarth, 
whose translation of Erckmann-Chatrian's " Story 
of a Peasant," in two volumes, is also added to the 
department of fiction ; Mignet's " History of the 
French Revolution," with an introduction by Mr. 
L. Cecil Jane; Josephus's "Wars of the Jews," 
with an introduction by Dr. Jacob Hart; Emer- 
son's Poems, with an introduction by Professor 
Bakewell, of Yale ; Ibsen's " Brand " translated by 
Mr. F. E. Garrett; and an "Anthology of British 
Historical Speeches and Orations," compiled by 
Mr. Ernest Rhys. 

Walter Crane, the English artist, author, and 
lecturer, died on March 15, at the age of seventy. 
His first illustrated book, " The New Forest," ap- 
peared in 1863. During his long career he has won 
many high honors, including membership in several 
of the principal academies in England and on the 
Continent. His published writings include "An 
Artist's Reminiscences," " India Impressions," and 
" William Morris and Whistler." Of his work in 
illustration, through which he was most widely 
known, the sumptuous edition of Spenser's " Faerie 
Queene " is doubtless the best example. His famous 



" toy-books " are known to children everywhere. 
The type of gift-book represented by his " Flower 
Wedding," "A Masque of Days," " Flowers from 
Shakespeare's Garden," etc., and several others, 
was extremely popular with an older generation. 

" Studies in Philology " will hereafter be pub- 
lished by the University of North Carolina in the 
form of a quarterly journal. The first number, 
bearing the date January, 1915, contains a critical 
edition by Professor James H. Hanford of " Wine, 
Beere, Ale, and Tobacco, Contending for Su- 
periority," a curious debate play, hitherto acces- 
sible only in a rare reprint. Besides being of value 
because of its numerous contemporary allusions, 
relating particularly to the manners and customs 
of the tavern, this text has special interest for the 
student of Elizabethan drama as a survival of the 
interlude and as a specimen of the minor entertain- 
ments in vogue at the universities. In his intro- 
duction Professor Hanford has discussed the 
sources of the material and shown the close con- 
nection existing between this piece and several 
well-known Cambridge University plays. The first, 
second, and third editions have been collated for 
the first time, and the text has been fully illustrated 
in notes. In form, the new quarterly is eminently 
attractive. 

Charles Francis Adams, historian and publicist, 
direct descendant of two United States presidents, 
son of one of our most distinguished diplomats, 
and otherwise claiming the regard and remem- 
brance of posterity, died at his winter home in 
Washington, March 20. Born in Boston, May 27, 
1835, and graduated from Harvard in 1856, he 
studied law in the office of Richard Henry Dana, 
author of " Two Years before the Mast," and was 
admitted to the bar, but had hardly entered upon 
the practice of his profession before the outbreak 
of the war claimed his energies, and its close found 
him more interested in railway management, in 
various public questions, and in historical and other 
studies, than in the calling which he had at first 
chosen. In the field of letters and learning he is 
to be remembered for his epoch-making Phi Beta 
Kappa oration at Cambridge in 1883, when he 
delivered himself of sundry opinions concerning 
"A College Fetich" (classical studies) that are 
thought to have turned the tide at Harvard and 
beyond in favor of the sciences in education, for 
his biography of Richard Henry Dana, his " Three 
Episodes of Massachusetts History," " Massa- 
chusetts, its Historians and its History," the life 
of his father in the "American Statesmen " series, 
and several volumes of miscellanies on historical, 
diplomatic, and military themes. Two years ago 
he delivered at Oxford a course of lectures on 
American history. His long connection with the 
Massachusetts Historical Society, his repeated re- 
election to the Harvard Board of Overseers, his 
many appointments to public positions of im- 
portance, and the learned degrees and other honors 
conferred upon him, bore witness to the high esteem 
in which he was held. A clear and ready writer, 
with aptitude for historical research, he made 
notable contributions to the history of his native 
State, and wrote also with mastery of other sub- 
jects.

Can You Imagine 

a friend, interested as you are in all kinds of 
literary work, who would come to you fort- 
nightly to discuss your writing in frank, 
common-sense fashion? 

This friend would not talk too much at each visit. He 
would not keep you top long from your new story or essay 
or poem. His friendships among other writers successful 
and aspiring to be successful and among editors would 
be such that he would refine for you, in preparation for 
each visit, practical, helpful advice from these folk that 
would send you to your desk with a new outlook on your 
work and new inspiration to make it more successful. 
This friend would look carefully over about 1 ,000 magazines 
each month to discover for you news that would enaole you 
to keep abreast of the manuscript requirements of editors. 
He would find correspondents who would glean 2,000 more 
magazines and papers for you so that you would always 
know in advance of prize contests, changes in editorial 
policies, suspensions, changes of address, requirements of 
new publications, film manufacturers, etc. Your imagina- 
tion goes no further. A friend of this admirable type would 
have to be superhuman. 

There is such a friend it's a very human, kindly 
little magazine THE EDITOR, which makles 
profitable and pleasant fortnightly visits to the elect 
of the writing fraternity. Be one of the elect one 
of those who elect to leave nothing undone that will 
contribute to success. The fee is $2.00 it pays 
for 26 fortnightly numbers of THE EDITOR for 
one year. (Single copy ten cents.)

What "Every Column Clean" 
Means in 

Detroit Saturday Night 

IT is the approved standard of journalism 
that maintains the same supervision over 
the advertising columns as is maintained 
over the editorial columns. It is the stand- 
ard which makes it possible for the publisher 
to guarantee every representation of the 
advertiser. Consequently the reader of such 
a journal has a degree of confidence in the 
advertising columns which does not prevail 
in the publication which permits the adver- 
tiser to mislead and defraud its readers. 
This should be a standard invaluable to the 
book publisher and the book advertiser. 
Detroit Saturday Night has the confidence 
of the book readers of Detroit and Michigan . 
Its readers will buy the books that are adver- 
tised in this publication's columns because 
they have confidence in Detroit Saturday 
Night's judgment in the acceptance of 
advertisements. That is the sort of publi- 
cation you ought to make your announce- 
ments in, Mr. Publisher.

"VICTORY" 

By 

Joseph Conrad 

" Victory " tells the romance 
of Axel Heyst and Lena, the 
girl from a traveling Ladies' 
Orchestra, and their strange 
life on the deserted South Sea 
Island of Samburan. 

Cut off from civilization ex- 
cept for the monthly passing of 
a trading vessel, they live there 
undisturbed until the sinister 
descent upon the island of those 
ill-omened messengers of the 
outside world, " plain Mr. 
Jones " and Ricardo. Then 
for the first time the tender- 
ness and pathos of this strange 
romance is unveiled to the 
reader. 

The appeal in " Victory " is 
universal. It is the story of a 
woman's love, superb in its 
faith and triumph, told in a 
simple, direct style that is the 
antithesis of his last novel, 
" Chance." 

Just out. Net, $1.35 

Two Editions Before Publication 

Doubleday, Page & Co. 
Garden City New York 



"A narrative that gets under way on 
the very first page, and proceeds unin- 
terruptedly to a sforzando and melo- 
dramatic close. Conrad applies to the 
unfolding of it all the resources of his 
extraordinary art, and particularly all 
his gift for the dark, the threatening, 
the sinister. 

"From the moment that Jones and 
Ricardo reach the crazy island jetty, 
sun -blistered, purple -faced, half dead 
of thirst from this moment to the last 
scene of all, there is no halting or turn- 
ing aside. 

"Put upon paper by a lesser man it 
would become a mere penny-dreadful. 
But as it is told by Conrad it takes on 
the Homeric proportions of an epic, a 
saga. Told in a straightforward, almost 
bald manner, with no apparent effort 
to build up effects, it yet leaves upon the 
mind a picture almost as vivid and as 
haunting as that left by Heart of Dark- 
ness. It is closer to the conventional 
novel than anything else he has done, 
and yet it is full of his characteristic 
touches. ''

BRACTON: DE LEGIBUS ET CONSUETUDINIBUS ANGLIAE. 

Edited by GEORGE E. WOODBINE, Assistant Professor of History in Yale College. (Yale Historical 
Publications. Series II.) 

The names of Bracton and Blackstone are the greatest in the history of English legal writing. Yet Bracton's 
DE LEGIBUS ET CONSUETUDINIBUS ANGLIAE, the most important legal work of the Middle Ages, has never before 
been edited with adequate care. 

Professor Woodbine 's work is based upon a thorough study of all the extant manuscripts of the treatise in accordance 
with the tenets of modern historical criticism. His extensive research shows that many passages in former printed editions 
have no rightful place in Bracton's book. Nothing has been left undone to make as perfect as possible this edition, which 
will, without doubt, prove to be the final one of this great work. It is to be issued in six volumes, of which the first is now 
ready. Vol. I. Imperial 8vo. Board Binding. 422 pages. Price, $3.00 net, carriage extra. (Circular upon request.) 



THE DIVINE COMEDY. Trans- 
lated by HENRY JOHNSON, Director of the 
Bowdoin Museum of Fine Arts. 

Professor Johnson has availed himself of the freedom 
of blank verse to make his work flexible and therefore 
easily read and understood. He has succeeded remark- 
ably in his attempt to render Dante's meaning as def- 
initely as possible. 

I2tno. Cloth binding. 436 pages. Price, $2.50 net, 
postpaid. 



FAIRYLAND. 



By BRIAN HOOKER, M.A. 

This, the book of the opera, is full of a meaning and 
charm which proves it worthy of its name and of the 
honor which has been awarded it. 

Mr. Hooker has created a grown-up's fairyland 
which is as charming as those which children imagine 
to themselves.

CRITICAL ESSAYS of THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY, 1700-1725. 

Edited by WILLARD H. DURHAM, Ph.D., Instructor in English in the Sheffield Scientific School, 
Yale University. 

The first quarter of the eighteenth century witnessed the publication of a number of valuable literary criticisms, 
which have since become so rare as to be inaccessible save in one or two large libraries. It has remained for Dr. Durham 
to assemble them from their remote shelyes and to group them in the present volume, with enough of those better known to 
represent fairly the various types of English critical thought current at that time. Taken together thus, the essays shed new 
light on the period and lead to new deductions which make necessary a reconsideration of many generalizations which have 
heretofore been commonly received. 8vo. Cloth binding. 445 pages. Price, $1.75 net, postpaid. 



THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS 
OF NUTRITION. By GRAHAM 

LUSK, M.D., Professor of Physiology, Cornell 
University Medical College, and Scientific Direc- 
tor of the Russell Sage Institute of Pathology. 

"Patients and laymen often ask for simple books 
on the theory of diet, and to such inquirers this brochure 
can be entirely recommended. The position and rep- 
utation of Professor Lusk are sufficient guarantee of the 
scientific accuracy and value 9f the matter presented, 
though the presentation is so simple that every one can 
follow it. Persons who cannot realize the importance 
of a knowledge of calories 'must be reasoned with and 
persuaded to listen.' They cannot do better than begin 
with these lectures." The Lancet (England).

SCIENCE AND RELIGION: 

THE RATIONAL AND THE SUPER- 
RATIONAL. An address delivered before the Phi 
Beta Kappa Association in the City of New York 
by Professor Cassius J. Keyser, Adrian Professor 
of Mathematics at Columbia University. 

"We have here an original and striking application 
of geometric processes to problems of religion. President 
Hibben in expressing his admiration for this little volume 
casually remarked to the present reviewer that he wished 

every alumnus of Princeton might read it This bare 

abstract can give no idea of the distinction of Professor 
Keyser 's style, the subtlety of his logic, the aptness of 
his illustrations and the subdued fervor of his thinking. 
The little essay thrills with the amor intellectualis of the 
great mystics." 

J. Duncan Spaeth in The Princeton Alumni Weekly.

POEMS. By BRIAN HOOKER, M.A. 

This first volume of Brian Hooker 's verse will realize^ the reading public 's high expectation of his talent, based on 
his fugitive pieces as well as on his success in the opera field. His poetry is marked by a surety of touch, a sincerity of purpose 
and a felicity of expression as rare in contemporary verse as it is welcome. While it covers a wide range of feeling and is 
expressed in several lyric forms, not once is there a surrender in the poet 's lofty conception of his task nor the eager upright- 
ness of his philosophy. izmo. Cloth binding. 146 pages. Price, $1.00 net, postpaid. 

CONSERVATION OF WATER BY STORAGE. By GEORGE FILLMORE 

SWAIN, LL.D., GORDON McKAY Professor of Civil Engineering, Harvard University. (Chester S. 
Lyman Lectures, delivered at the Sheffield Scientific School, Yale University.) 

Professor Swain acted as chairman of the Water Power Committee of the Fourth Conservation Congress and, both 
before and since, he has investigated the subject of Water Conservation and given it his very careful consideration. 

The volume opens with a chapter on the general subject of conservation, which is followed by a discussion of the 
relation of the conservation of water to that of other resources. The author then considers the question of federal control 
of water power, summarizing his conclusions after mature consideration. Ninety-one beautiful illustrations add greatly 
to the value and interest of the book. 8vo. Cloth binding. 376 pages. 91 illustrations. Index. Price, $3.00 net, postpaid.

PLAT OR PAMPHLET? 



After the debauch of wit in the Restoration 
Comedy and Jeremy Collier's triumph over 
the stage, audiences became virtuous, and play 
providers gave them what they wanted in 
tragedies which would turn them to repen- 
tance and comedies which would make them 
cry. The French called the new species of 
drama la comedie larmoyante. Diderot in 
France, Steele in England, and even Lessing 
in Germany gave in to the fashion, though 
the latter soon recovered himself. When the 
real comic spirit rose again incarnate in Gold- 
smith he had great difficulty in getting a 
hearing. His "Good Natured Man" was de- 
nounced as "low," and the scene with the 
Bailiffs was hissed. ' ' She Stoops to Conquer ' ' 
was rejected by one manager, and held by 
another for a year. 

Literary fashions, like those of women's 
clothes, recur in cycles, and for a good while 
we have had a surfeit of what may be called 
the preaching mania on the stage. Where do 
all the wild-eyed faddists come from who in 
their multitude have burst into the theatre 
with plays of every conceivable kind except 
plays of amusement, of poetic exaltation, of 
creative power? Every reform, or what fan- 
tastic minds conceive to be a reform, must have 
its play. We have had plays of sexology, of 
education, of hygiene, and what not. The 
plays on hygiene seem to predominate. We 
suppose we shall next have a play on the negro 
theory that you should cut your corns in the 
dark of the moon. This would be harmless 
compared with the dramatization of medical 
treatises with which we have been regaled of 
late. 

This pamphleteering drama seems to have 
had its origin with Ibsen. Now Ibsen was a 
playwright of the first water, and in his early 
romantic dramas and in his long dramatic 
poems a genuine poet. There are gleams of 
humor and of common sense in his comedies. 
But his formula for a comedy seems to have 
been this: Find some sore spot in humanity 
and make a play of it. And his lugubrious 
dramas and their progeny have filled the thea- 
tres of Europe and America.

[April 15 



Particularly is America favorable soil for 
this pamphleteering seed. If anybody neglects 
an opportunity to preach in this country, he 
is suspect. Our public men go around like 
Joseph Surface, with his eternal "the man 
who." The didactic instinct is rooted in us, 
and has been strong enough to stifle any genu- 
ine creative impulse, except in the case of a 
few who have dared to "see life steadily and 
see it whole." That this didactic turn in us is 
accompanied by any greater average goodness 
than among other peoples may be questioned. 
Thomas Wentworth Higginson once rebuked 
the present writer for using the stock phrase, 
' ' the New England conscience. ' ' He thought 
it a bugbear, and had lived more than four- 
score years among such consciences without 
finding any excess of them. But that the 
moralizing strain outweighed the artistic one 
among his neighbors is only too patent. 

That art should be immoral or even unmoral 
is nonsense. In the drama, more than any 
other form of art, there is a clash of opposites, 
of good and evil, of the beautiful and the ugly, 
of the graceful and the grotesque. That any 
sane dramatist should prefer the inferior 
qualities or things is practically impossible. 
But he ought to have full liberty to set them 
forth in all their power and repulsiveness. 
He ought to be fair to the energy, intellect, 
and share of goodness in the personages in 
whom are embodied the lower principles. His 
heroes cannot be all white, or his villains all 
black. The 'a<>.apria of Aristotle was that 
fatal weakness in the central character from 
which the catastrophe arose. Besides, there is 
no fixed system of morality. Is war right or 
wrong? Is divorce right or wrong? Must 
one, as Kant maintained, always tell the truth, 
even to a murderer seeking his victim? Is 
it criminal for a starving man to steal food? 
Is it murder or patriotism to kill a despot? 
These and many other questions have always 
been debated. Whole shoals of plays have 
been based on views of morality now obsolete 
or partially so. The dramatist has wide lati- 
tude. If he communicates the shock of vital 
strength to us, or permeates us with a sense of 
beauty, it is as much as we have a right to 
expect. But the pamphleteering dramatist 
takes some abstract question of morality, or 
some concrete custom, and argues it out by the 
means of puppets to whom no fair play is 
allowed, who are merely punching-bags for his 
intellectual exercise. 



The play with a purpose was preceded by 
the novel with a purpose. Dickens had 
usually some direct utilitarian or charitable 
end to carry out. But it was always so 
swamped by the overwhelming humor and 
creative force of his work that it gives readers 
of to-day no concern. Victor Hugo, too, in his 
greatest novel tilted against all the wrongs and 
injustices of the world; but here, also, the 
interest of the narrative and the flood of 
poetry sweep us along and make us forget that 
we are witnessing a social insurrection. It is 
perhaps too soon to criticize the purpose plays, 
but we doubt whether they are clothed with 
enough poetry and humor and created flesh to 
make us forget the grinning skeleton of their 
didacticism. We are inclined to think that 
they have less staying quality than even the 
despised Victorian drama. Such plays as 
"Richelieu," "The Lady of Lyons," "The 
Hunchback," "Masks and Faces," and 
' ' Caste ' ' have held the boards for a long time. 
Bulwer and Reade had probably as much intel- 
lectual force as the problem men, and they 
seem to have produced figures and scenes of 
permanent appeal to mankind. 

It is perhaps in order to say what should 
take the place of the purpose play. Well, 
there is the whole spectacle of life to choose 
from. There are a billion and a half people in 
the world, and something is happening to 
them every day. There is the whole recorded 
past to furnish subjects. And the mind of 
man can invent, and can at least make an at- 
tempt to pierce into the realm of death and the 
unknown. The Moving Picture shows, what- 
ever may be their shortcomings, can at least 
give us a hint of what is wanted. We believe 
the managers of these entertainments have 
tried a few problem subjects, but that they did 
not in the least succeed. Stories of adven- 
ture, of romantic love and domestic devotion, 
of great crimes, of moving accidents by land 
and sea, of uproarious fun, these take best. 
Shilling shockers like the "Agamemnon," 
"Macbeth," or "Faust" are really what the 
world craves in the way of excitement: hero- 
ism and pure love and undying devotion al- 
ways appeal to it. The taste of the public is 
always sound, only it is not educated up 
to the adequate literary presentation of its 
favorite themes. When we consider that the 
Athenian public, with its wonderfully trained 
intelligence, banished ^Eschylus and preferred 
Euripides to Sophocles we can hardly expect 



1915] 



THE DIAL

perfect critical judgment from our own motley 
population. 

To be more specific, we think the drama 
should confine itself more strictly to its various 
kinds. A tragedy ought to be a tragedy, and 
a comedy a comedy. Mixing of distinct breeds 
rarely brings good results. It would be pretty 
hard to classify some of the plays of Ibsen or 
Strindberg. Comedy ought to recover its 
gaiety and shed its weeds of woe. Signs are 
not wanting that the purpose-problem-pam- 
phlet style of play is going out of fashion. 
There have been produced in New York this 
past winter a considerable number of plays 
calculated to amuse intelligent people. If to 
these could be added some dramas of poetic 
exaltation, some tragedies that plumb the 
depths, we should have the beginning of a 
serious theatre in this country. 

The question of a drama poetic not only 
in intent but in form is an interesting one. 
There is no real reason except a stupid preju- 
dice why verse should not be used again upon 
the stage. It is a pity to banish it, for it is to 
a play something like what a frame is to a 
picture. It separates the play from the world, 
and concentrates its effects. But we believe 
that blank verse, which is the most flexible and 
natural of metres, is impossible, simply be- 
cause it has been preempted. A modern blank 
verse play inevitably seems a faded copy of a 
Shakespearean original. The best poets and 
metrists of recent times Shelley, Tennyson, 
Browning, Swinburne have tried to galvan- 
ize this form into life, all to little purpose. 
But there are plenty of other metrical forms. 
The heroic couplet reigned for a considerable 
time on the English stage, and it might be 
revived. The lyric choruses of the Greek 
drama lightened up the grave iambic verse. 
The Spanish drama used a great variety of 
metres and forms, huddling together asso- 
nant verse, redondillas, canzonets, and son- 
nets in a single play. There is something like 
this variety in the early plays of Shake- 
speare "Love's Labour's Lost," for in- 
stance. Verse of some kind we ought to have, 
for we can never get with prose the concen- 
tration or the atmosphere requisite for the 
greatest dramatic effects. 

The purpose-problem play came into being 
mainly from one cause, the unrest of women 
and their desire to have their wrongs and 
rights expounded on the stage. Possibly this 
has been sufficiently done, and now men may 



demand their innings; or, rather, men and 
women together may recur to the elemental 
things of life, loves, hates, heroisms, sacri- 
fices, and demand these from the stage. They 
are demanding them from the Moving Picture 
shows, and the speaking theatre is surely a 
more satisfactory thing. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

FRENCH APPRECIATION OF ENGLISH LITERA- 
TURE, so far as that appreciation is manifested 
by scholars and writers, has in recent times 
been greatly in contrast with earlier ignorance 
of and contempt for the writings of those 
benighted beings so unfortunate as to have 
been born outside of France. Flippant dis- 
praise of Shakespeare is no longer considered 
smart in the literary circles of Paris. Of 
course Taine is the conspicuous modern in- 
stance of French appreciation of the writers 
of England, but for one such sympathetic stu- 
dent of those writers half a century ago there 
are now a dozen or more in the France of 
to-day. Professor Emile Legouis, who holds 
the chair of English language and literature at 
the Sorbonne, and is widely known for his 
published works in his department, naturally 
comes to mind in this connection. A notable 
article from his pen appears in the current 
issue of ' ' The Yale Review, ' ' under the head- 
ing, ''English Literature in France." His 
opening sentence is significant. He says: 
"The opinion now prevailing in England, and 
beginning to spread in America, seems to be, 
if I am well informed, that, outside of the 
English-speaking countries themselves, France 
is as distinctly ahead of other nations in En- 
glish literary criticism, properly so called, as 
Germany has long been and still remains in 
English philology." A little later, in consid- 
ering the "erudite (historical, objective, scien- 
tific) mode" of studying English literature, 
he has this to say in tribute to American schol- 
arship : "In some directions, it is true, and 
particularly in the field of research that we 
are now concerned with, I wonder whether 
America has not actually outstripped Ger- 
many herself, after having been her disciple. 
As I was some time ago getting up a small 
popular book on Chaucer and had to acquaint 
myself with the most recent critical works on 
his life and poetry, I was struck by the pre- 
dominance of Americans in the list of the 
latest discoverers. Foremost in the catalogue 
were the names of Professors Kittredge, Scho- 
field, Tatlock, Root, Lowes, Young, and others, 
nearly dispossessing the country of Ten 



290

Brink of her former supremacy." In closing 
he emphasizes his impression of a prevalent 
"admiration and reverence for English litera- 
ture" on the part of its students in France. 



A PROMISING PROFESSION FOR BOOK-LOVERS 

who would like to be book-writers, but who 
somehow, in spite of undeniable skill in the 
manipulation of pen or typewriter, cannot 
exactly hit it off when it comes to original 
literary production, has long been found in 
the pleasant task of handling, for the benefit 
of other book-lovers, the works of those envied 
beings who have succeeded in becoming book- 
producers. There is always the possibility, 
too, that in this close contact with the best that 
has been thought and said in the world, the 
contagion of authorship will in some myste- 
rious manner be caught, with ultimately grati- 
fying results in renown and royalties. Was 
not the celebrated author of the world-famous 
"Critique of Pure Reason" once employed in 
this very task of handling the books of others 
in the Royal Library at Konigsberg? And 
was there not a certain librarian of the Boston 
Public Library, and later head of the Harvard 
University Library, who is now even better 
known for his learned contributions to histori- 
cal literature than for his noteworthy services 
to librarianship ? Let us then, we who love 
books and would fain write them also, embrace 
the librarian's calling and see what will hap- 
pen. But is it so easy to get a position as libra- 
rian ? Hear what they say about it at one of 
our largest library schools. "For several 
years," it is reported from Madison, "the 
number graduating from the Library School 
of the University [of Wisconsin] exceeded 
the number graduated from any other simi- 
lar school in the country," but with all this 
annual output "there never has been the 
slightest difficulty in obtaining positions for 
the graduates of the school. In 1913 out of 
31 who were graduated 29 had positions at 
the time of graduation. In 1914 out of 29 who 
were to graduate 26 had received appoint- 
ments at graduation." Could there be any- 
thing more alluring than the pleasant path 
leading through this semi-literary profession 
to all sorts of delightful possibilities in a pro- 
fession that is wholly literary and supremely 

soul-satisfying ? 



READING IN IRELAND, especially in western 
Ireland, appears to be a pastime not much in- 
dulged in by people generally, though there is 
an immense respect for books and those who 
write them, a respect inversely proportional 
to the intimacy of acquaintance with things 
literary. Familiarity breeds contempt, as the 



proverb assures us. In "Castle Rackrent," 
though the mistress of the castle reads "The 
Sorrows of Werther, " her lord and master is 
far more interested in his own multiplying 
troubles and difficulties; and at the present 
day the Irishman who digs and delves for his 
livelihood has little time or inclination to go 
deeply into books. A shelf of ancient and 
well-thumbed volumes is likely to be found 
in the farmhouse, but the family reading is 
chiefly confined to "Old Moore's Almanack" 
and either "The Irish Weekly Independent" 
or "The Weekly Freeman." "Old Moore," 
by the way, in his last year's almanac pre- 
dicted "grave trouble in Europe about this 
time." A writer in the current number of 
"The Book Monthly," Mr. Thomas Kelly, to 
whom acknowledgment is due for various 
items here noted, reveals the rather surprising 
fact, if it be a fact, that in the land of their 
nativity "Lever and Lover are very rarely 
seen, though 'Handy Andy' is to be met with 
occasionally" another illustration of the rule 
respecting prophets in their own country. 
Even Canon Hannay (better known as 
"George A. Birmingham") is rather roughly 
handled by those who pretend to be competent 
critics. But among the common people of lit- 
tle book-learning, as already intimated, au- 
thors and their works are more likely than not 
to be held in reverence. Mr. Kelly relates an 
amusing incident in this connection. "I re- 
member seeing in one house a booklet whose 
author I knew. He lived in the neighbouring 
town, and I mentioned this fact to 'the man 
of the house. ' ' Is it a man that could write a 
book,' he queried in no slight surprise, 'to be 
livin' in the town o' Drumdallagh 'ithin ten 
mile o' where I stand? Man, oh man, do ye 
tell me that? Where now would his house be 
in the town, for I'll go an' have a look at the 
outside o' it the next day I'm in at the 
market. ' ' 



INDEXERS' IDIOSYNCRASIES are often amiable 
and harmless, and sometimes unamiable and 
injurious to the interests of index-users. A pas- 
sion for fulness of entry in the case of personal 
names may cause more consumption of time 
than is worth while, but no harm is done unless 
other more important duties are neglected in 
consequence. On the other hand, the scrupu- 
lous substitution of a little-known real name 
for a universally-known popular designation 
may give rise to vexation and bewilderment 
and smothered (if not eruptive) profanity. 
Thomas Jonathan Jackson, for example, is 
known to students of American history as 
identical with "Stonewall" Jackson, but to 
the great American public the sturdy general

is "Stonewall," and not Thomas Jonathan, 
and it has a right to expect the nickname to 
appear in the index or catalogue, as in truth it 
often though not always does. Mr. Rossiter 
Johnson, in a protest published in the March 
"Library Journal," complains of the misdi- 
rected scrupulosity of some professional index- 
ers, and takes occasion to point out a common 
and rather unwise practice on the part of 
book-indexers, who for some reason think it 
necessary to enter in the index the general sub- 
ject of the book. He refers especially to biog- 
raphies, and cites a real or supposed life of 
General Putnam, the index to which contains 
such entries as this: "Putnam, Israel, his en- 
counter with a wolf, ' ' which should have been : 
' ' Wolf, Putnam 's encounter with a. ' ' And he 
speaks of a recent admirable biography of a 
famous American that devotes ten solid col- 
umns of its index to the subject of the book, 
as if any mortal reader would have the pa- 
tience to search for a needle in that haystack ! 
He might have instanced an even more 
flagrant recent example: the admirable biog- 
raphy of Mark Twain by his authorized biog- 
rapher gives almost thirteen columns of its 
excellent index to the entry, "Twain, Mark." 


THE CREATOR OF COLONEL CARTER OF CAR- 
TERSVILLE was fifty-three years old when this 
product of his invention placed h.im in the 
front rank of those who have delineated the 
Old South felicitously in fiction. Francis 
Hopkinson Smith, a descendant of that gifted 
Francis Hopkinson who immortalized himself 
by affixing his signature to the Declaration of 
Independence, was born October 23, 1838, in 
Baltimore, and died April 7, 1915, in New 
York. Early reverses in the family fortunes 
forced him to shift for himself with little of 
the educational equipment accounted neces- 
sary for a fair start in life. A clerkship in his 
brother's iron works was cut short by the fail- 
ure of the business, after which came engineer- 
ing studies in New York and the opening of an 
office as contractor. Much constructive work 
jetties, breakwaters, lighthouses, sea-walls, 
etc. was undertaken for the government, 
and a permanent and conspicuous reminder of 
this phase of Mr. Smith 's varied activity is the 
foundation of the Bartholdi Statue of Liberty, 
as also the Race Rock Lighthouse, off New Lon- 
don, of which its builder was especially proud. 
His vacations meanwhile were largely given to 
sketching in the White Mountains, Cuba, Mex- 
ico, and later in Venice, Constantinople, and 
Holland. He had drawn and painted from 
boyhood, being chiefly self-taught in this form 
of art. At about forty years of age he began 
to discover his genius in literature, in slight 



sketches of travel and observation, and later in 
stories and novels. Best known among his long 
list of books are such favorites as "Colonel 
Carter of Cartersville, " "Caleb West," "Oli- 
ver Horn, " " Peter, ' ' and ' ' Kennedy Square. ' ' 
Wholesome and hearty are these and other 
romances of his, a little obvious and old- 
fashioned in their construction, perhaps, but 
for that very reason, in part, of unfailing 
acceptability with the great novel-reading pub- 
lic. A more variously gifted novelist it would 
be hard to name, and his death is more than a 
grievous loss to literature. 


HEAVY READING in more senses than one was 
the famous collection of all extant cuneiform 
literature in the royal library of Asurbanipal, 
king of Assyria. Baked clay took the place of 
paper in that formidable assemblage of books, 
and the total tonnage of the library must have 
been tremendous. But it represented the 
golden age of Assyrian literature, and so must 
have possessed other virtues besides mere 
weight. A similar collection, though of much 
smaller proportions, is that which now has its 
abode in a room of the New York Public 
Library under the careful guardianship of 
Mr. Victor Hugo Paltsits, known of old to 
many obliged readers as the assistant librarian 
of the now vanished Lenox Library in upper 
Fifth Avenue. In a recent number of the 
"Library Bulletin" Mr. Paltsits gives some 
description of the precious collection in his 
keeping. "The earliest records in the Li- 
brary, ' ' he says, ' ' are baked-clay tablets, cylin- 
ders, slabs, etc., in the Sumerian language, 
dating from the time of Naram-Sin, son of 
Sargon, about 2600 B. c. ; Gimil-Sin, King of 
Ur, about 2200 B. c., and other reigns in Baby- 
lonia. There are also cuneiform inscriptions 
in the Assyrian language of the reign of 
Ashur-nasir-pal, King of Assyria, 885-860 
B.C., and of Nebuchadressar II., King of 
Babylon, 604-561 B.C., in the Babylonian 
language." m . . 

AN EXILED REVIEW, sharing courageously the 
lot of many of its former writers and readers, 
will presently resume its activities under the 
protection of the University of Cambridge. 
"Le Museon," a long-established quarterly 
publication devoted to Oriental studies, edited 
of late by Professor Philippe Colin et of Lou- 
vain University and Professor L. de la Vallee 
Poussin of Ghent University, and published 
by the former institution, has been taken in 
charge by the Syndics of the Cambridge Uni- 
versity Press, which is about to issue the de- 
layed first number of the current year. Both 
Cambridge and Oxford have shown generous 



292

hospitality to the expatriated academicians of 
devastated Belgium, so that this fortunate 
rescue of the "Museon" from extinction or 
indefinite suspension is but an extension of 
previous good offices. Whether the future con- 
tinuation of the review will be possible must 
depend upon those who give their interest and 
support to its department of learning. Among 
the announced contributors to the next two 
issues are such recognized authorities in their 
several departments as Professor J. B. Bury, 
Professor James Hope Moulton, Professor 
E. G. Browne, Dr. F. W. Thomas, Librarian 
to the India Office, Dr. Reynold A. Nicholson, 
Lecturer in Persian at Cambridge, and Mr. 
A. A. Bevan, Lady Almoner's Reader in 
Arabic at the same university. 


CANADA'S CONTRIBUTION TO POLITE LITERA- 
TURE is greater than is commonly suspected 
outside of Canada, or perhaps inside. The 
Department of Education of the Province of 
Ontario issues quarterly "A Selected List of 
Books Recommended by the Ontario Library 
Association for Purchase by the Public Libra- 
ries of the Province, ' ' and the current number 
contains bibliographies, not aiming at com- 
pleteness but nevertheless impressive, of Cana- 
dian fiction, poetry, and biography, with a list 
of Canadian magazines. These bibliographies, 
in which "titles have been chosen chiefly on 
the grounds of availability and value," fill 
twenty-two large pages, and are of a nature 
to commend themselves as aids to librarians 
beyond as well as within the borders of the 
Dominion. The pamphlet is obtainable from 
Mr. "Walter R. Nursey, Inspector of Public 
Libraries, Toronto, though to what extent and 
on what terms it will be supplied to applicants 
outside of Ontario, we cannot say. 



A RENAISSANCE IN YIDDISH LITERATURE 

to be taking place in the Ghetto of New York. 
Present hard conditions in Europe have 
caused a sort of Jewish exodus that may be 
found to have some points of resemblance, 
however remote, to the emigration of the 
Moors from Spain in the sixteenth century, 
and of the Huguenots from France in the sev- 
enteenth. At any rate, the sum of literary 
and artistic talent on the Continent has been 
diminished by the self-expatriation of not a 
few men and women unusually gifted and 
accomplished, and of these there are some 
marked instances now attracting attention 
among the Semitic population of our chief 
city. This incoming tide of talent includes 
such names, real or pseudonymous, as Scholem 
Ash, Abraham Raisin, Scholem Aleichem, and 
Perez Hirschbein. Of the "Yiddish Mark 



Twain" (Scholem Aleichem) appreciative 
mention has already been made in these col- 
umns, and the others here enumerated have 
shown themselves no less skilled in their sev- 
eral departments of prose and verse, of fiction 
and drama and well-turned poem. Increased 
means of approach to their readers have been 
provided for these and other new writers by 
the starting of additional magazines and other 
periodical publications in the Yiddish tongue, 
together with a monthly magazine in English 
for the publishing of translations from these 
Jewish authors. One of the most interesting 
figures in this new school of Yiddish writers is 
Mr. Perez Hirschbein, the "poet-wanderer," 
as he has been styled, whose unmetrical me- 
dium of expression seems well adapted to his 
thought, and ought not to be summarily dis- 
missed with the ridicule so often visited upon 
this form of literature. On the whole, it ap- 
pears not unlikely that in the accession here 
noted of fresh talent, perhaps even genius, 
among our writing folk, it may turn out that 
American literature has been appreciably the 
gainer, and European literature correspond- 
ingly the loser. 

AFTER FORTY YEARS OF NOVEL- WRITING, or 
nearly that, with a record, according to her 
own account, of sixty novels to her credit, Mrs. 
Amelia E. Barr passes into her eighty-fifth 
year with feelings of calm content as she looks 
back upon the road her feet have travelled. It 
was not until after the death of her husband 
and three sons from yellow fever at Galveston, 
in 1867, that she, with three daughters depen- 
dent on her, turned her energies to literature 
as a means of support. Those thirty-six years 
of her earlier life had certainly not been lack- 
ing in variety of experience on which to draw 
in the writing of fiction. Born in Lancashire, 
marrying early, and emigrating to this coun- 
try with her husband, Robert Barr, she gained 
an acquaintance with the ups and downs, the 
comedy and the tragedy of existence, such as 
can be claimed by few of our romancers. Two 
years ago, in her notable autobiographic vol- 
ume, "All the Days of My Life," she said 
of herself, what she would doubtless now re- 
peat with no change except in the statement of 
her age : "I have lived, I have loved, I have 
worked, and at eighty-two I only ask that the 
love and the work continue while I live. What 
I must do, I will love to do. It is a noble chem- 
istry that turns necessity into pleasure."

Illinois with no public library, and fifty-two 
cities, of two thousand or more inhabitants, 
also lacking in this important respect. 



COMMUNICATION. 

"THE DOCTOR" AND "TRISTRAM SHANDY." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

On opening the first volume of Southey's 
" Doctor," and noticing the delta with lines from 
the three angles meeting at the centre (it is pre- 
sented later in the text), one may or may not think 
of the astonishing illustrations to Sterne's " Tris- 
tram Shandy." But as soon as the reader finds 
that the first seven chapters run backwards, he can- 
not but remember how the chapters of the Opinions 
of Tristram were continually losimg ground as his 
life progressed. Next comes a belated preface, 
though not so long belated as was Sterne's. Then 
after the eighth forward-moving chapter there is 
one of a new sort, the heading of which, " Inter- 
chapter I.," is given only at the end; and this 
recalls the oddity of Sterne's chapters, e. g., the 
empty ones. Nor does the mechanical resemblance 
end here, for (to pass by Southey's various liberties 
in pointing) on page 28 a secret is offered to us in 
a series of groups of stars ; it needs not to mention 
the use of this device in the early life of Tristram. 

But to pass from these mechanical resemblances 
to the similarity of style. The account which the 
author of " The Doctor " gives of the conception 
of his book shows him to be a direct descendant of 
Mr. Shandy : there is the same nonchalant descrip- 
tion, the same scrappiness of conversation. But 
really the best way to illustrate is to quote the first 
paragraph : 

" I was in the fourth night of the story of the 
Doctor and his horse, and had broken it off, not like 
Scheherezade because it was time to get up, but 
because it was time to go to bed. It was at thirty- 
five minutes after ten o'clock, on the 20th of July in 
the year of our Lord 1813. I finished my glass of 
punch, tinkled the spoon against its side, as if making 
music to my meditations, and having my eyes fixed 
upon the Bhow Begum, who was sitting opposite to 
me at the head of her own table, I said, ' It ought to 
be written in a Book! ' " 

And Sterne's style in addressing his reader, best 
remembered from his charge to the reader to go 
back and re-read so as to pick up a lost point, has 
also been caught by the author of " The Doctor," 
at first, it must be remembered, an anonymous 
author. He says, almost at the end of the first 
volume : " Reader, you may skip this preliminary 
account if you please, but it will be to your loss 
if you do ! " 



In the material used, the two books resemble one 
another unmistakably. " The Doctor " is as full of 
quotations as "Tristram Shandy," quotations 
from the most surprising sources; but of course 
all the quotations are attributed to their authors, 
and so when Burton is used in the later work 
(vi., 227) his name is given with high praise. Yet 
no one could find in Southey that clever use of the 
material which seems to justify Sterne's unac- 
knowledged appropriation: Southey's product is 
a pretty heavy one. But, it may be asked, what 
about those incidents of Sterne's which have been 
the subject of so much reproach and so much 

apology ? Surely Southey could not ! Two 

of the incidents in " The Doctor " would shock the 
present taste quite as much as most of those in 
" Tristram Shandy." Both of them are neatly im- 
plied, full preliminary description and then 
clever hints. The author shows his relish for them, 
however, in a more honest way than his earlier 
model. After the first, an adventure of the Doctor's 
boyhood, the author in a conversation with Miss 
Graveairs (chap, xix.) justifies his previous chap- 
ter: she may banish Tristram Shandy as well as 
Smollett, Fielding, and Richardson, but she must 
not banish the Doctor ! The other notable incident 
is of the origin of Nobs, the Doctor's horse, told 
with a capital comical-serious air. But when we 
are half way through the next volume, we are given 
a " Chapter Extraordinary," in which we are told 
that a certain club has excised a chapter in vol- 
ume four, and that the author is accused of " lese 
delicatesse " or " tum-ti-tee." The author's defence 
is remarkably amusing, not least so in the introduc- 
tion of the name of Southey, a common trick 
throughout the book. 

One reference to Sterne has already been given, 
and there are several others. The bohemian con- 
versation between my Uncle Toby and Corporal 
Trim is quoted (iv., 376) and later referred to 
(v., 313). Here is a frank confession of the 
author's taste (v., 163) : " I will tell thee however, 
good reader, that the word itself, apart from all 
considerations of its mystical meaning, serves me 
for the same purpose to which the old tune of Lilli- 
burlero was applied by our dear Uncle Toby, our 
dear Uncle I say, for is he not your Uncle Toby, 
gentle Reader? yours as well as mine, if you are 
worthy to hold him in such relationship ; and so by 
that relationship, you and I are Cousins." Our 
Uncle's tune is mentioned once again (vi., 361). 
In another place Southey says he agrees with Mr. 
Shandy in disliking short noses (v., 231. cf. vii., 
489) ; why does he not mention him again in the 
consideration of Onomantia and Arithemomantia 
(vi., 86) or that of Christian names (vii., 249) ? 
A quotation from Sterne's Sermons (vi., 247, 
also vii., 181), and a criticism of his carrying his 
secular style into the pulpit, will serve to show how 
much more steady Southey's judgment was than 
Sterne's. Thus are we brought around to notice 
the vigorous and stable views of life which make up 
a large part of " The Doctor"; while such 'views 
are not to be found in " Tristram Shandy."

FRIENDLY JJETTERS OF A WANDERING 
NATURALIST.* 



John Muir's autobiography, brief and in- 
complete though it unfortunately is, has 
traced for us in delightful fashion the gifted 
Scottish lad's development under the dis- 
cipline of a harsh but salutary schooling, and 
no reader of that book can have failed to 
hunger for further chapters in continuation 
of its fascinating story. Those chapters can 
now never be written by the same hand that 
penned the earlier ones, but a partial substi- 
tute for them is offered in a collection of 
"Letters to a Friend" covering the years 
1866-79. But it is incorrect to speak of these 
letters as covering the thirteen and a half 
years over which they are scattered. The 
writer was too much interested in the won- 
ders of the world he roamed so extensively to 
spare time for describing his travels in any 
detail. It is, however, this very impatience of 
the drudgery of writing that causes him to 
pack into what he does write as much signifi- 
cance as the words can well convey. Poverty 
of thought is the last fault that will be 
charged against him. Hence the unusual 
readability, not to say charm, of these brief 
letters, filling in all not quite two hundred 
uncrowded pages. 

They were written in the impressionable 
years of early manhood, soon after their 
writer had completed his four years of unpre- 
scribed studies at the University of Wiscon- 
sin and had, as he picturesquely expresses it 
in his autobiography, "wandered away on a 
glorious botanical and geological excursion, 
which has lasted nearly fifty years and is not 
yet completed, always happy and free, poor 
and rich, without thought of a diploma or of 
making a name, urged on and on through 
endless, inspiring, Godful beauty." As to 
the fortunate receiver of these random letters 
by the way, the reader is informed in a brief 
prefatory note that "when John Muir was a 
student in the University of Wisconsin he 
was a frequent caller at the house of Dr. 
Ezra S. Carr. The kindness shown him there, 
and especially the sympathy which Mrs. Carr, 
as a botanist and a lover of nature, felt in the 
young man's interests and aims, led to the 
formation of a lasting friendship. He re- 
garded Mrs. Carr, indeed, as his 'spiritual 
mother,' and his letters to her in later years 
are the outpourings of a sensitive spirit to one

1866-1879. By John Muir. (Limited edition.) Boston:

who he felt thoroughly understood and sym- 
pathized with him. These letters are therefore 
peculiarly revealing of their writer's person- 
ality. Most of them were written from the 
Yosemite Valley, and they give a good notion 
of the life Muir led there, sheep-herding, 
guiding, and tending a sawmill at intervals 
to earn his daily bread, but devoting his real 
self to an ardent scientific study of glacial 
geology and a joyous and reverent communion 
with Nature." 

It is not surprising to find that one who as 
a boy had so wonderful a knack at inventing 
"machines for keeping time and getting up 
in the morning, and so forth," was not lack- 
ing, when it came to letter-writing, in the 
literary devices that impart liveliness and 
character to the written word as will ap- 
pear from such selections as available space 
will here allow the reviewer to reproduce. As 
a continuation of what we already know from 
Muir's own story of his native skill in devis- 
ing and fashioning all sorts of strange and 
more or less useful mechanical contrivances, 
the very first letter in the book, showing the 
young man as a factory hand somewhere in 
western Canada, is of interest. He writes: 

" I have been very busy of late making practical 
machinery. I like my work exceedingly, but would 
prefer inventions which would require some artis- 
tic as well as mechanical skill. I invented and put 
in operation a few days ago an attachment for a 
self-acting lathe, which has increased its capacity 
at least one third. We are now using it to turn 
broom-handles, and as these useful articles may 
now be made cheaper, and as cleanliness is one of 
the cardinal virtues, I congratulate myself in hav- 
ing done something like a true philanthropist for 
the real good of mankind in general. What say 
you? I have also invented a machine for making 
rake-teeth, and another for boring for them and 
driving them, and still another for making the 
bows, still another used in making the handles, 
still another for bending them, so that rakes may 
now be made nearly as fast again. Farmers will 
be able to produce grain at a lower rate, the poor 
get more bread to eat. Here is more philan- 
thropy; is it not? I sometimes feel as though I 
was losing time here, but I am at least receiving 
my first lessons in practical mechanics, and as one 
of the firm here is a millwright, and as I am per- 
mitted to make as many machines as I please and 
to remodel those now in use, the school is a pretty 
good one." 

From Canada to Indiana, thence to Wis- 
consin, thence again to Florida and Cuba and 
Panama and elsewhere in the South, and 
finally to California and the beloved home of 
mountains and glaciers and other manifesta- 
tions of untamed nature, we follow the eager 
and adventurous young scientist, finding him 
more nearly stationary for a considerable

period in the Yosemite than at any previous 
stage in his journeyings. As exhibiting 
powers both of observation and of description, 
as well as a fine artistic sense, the following 
from this paradise of scenic delights is note- 
worthy : 

" ' The Spirit ' has again led me into the wilder- 
ness, in opposition to all counter attractions, and 
I am once more in the glory of the Yosemite. . . . 
I wish you could have seen the edge of the snow- 
cloud which hovered, oh, so soothingly, down to 
the grand Pilot Peak brows, discharging its 
heaven-begotten snows with such unmistakable 
gentleness and moving perhaps with conscious 
love from pine to pine as if bestowing separate 
and independent blessings upon each. In a few 
hours we climbed under and into this glorious 
storm-cloud. What a harvest of crystal flowers 
and what wind songs were gathered from the 
spiry firs and the long fringy arms of the Lam- 
bert pine! . . . After making a fire with some 
cedar rails, I went out to watch the coming-on of 
the darkness, which was most impressively sub- 
lime. Next morning was every way the purest 
creation I ever beheld. The little flat, spot-like in 
the massive spiring woods, was in splendid vesture 
of universal white, upon which the grand forest- 
edge was minutely repeated and covered with a 
close sheet of snow flowers." 

Though lacking metre, this is as good as 
Lowell's poem, "The First Snow-Fail," and 
in the next paragraph the writer surpasses 
Lowell in originality (though not always in 
beauty) of imagery when he adds: "The 
common snow flowers belong to the sky and in 
storms are blown about like ripe petals in an 
orchard. They settle on the ground, the bot- 
tom of the atmospheric sea, like mud or leaves 
in a lake, and upon this soil, this field of 
broken sky flowers, grows a luxuriant carpet 
of crystal vegetation complete and ripe in a 
single night." But such scenes as these 
beguiled him into no merely passive contem- 
plation of their charms. The lure of the moun- 
tains beckoned him forth, and he went with 
alacrity. In another letter from the same 
region we read : 

" I have climbed more than twenty-four thou- 
sand -feet in these ten days, three times to the top 
of the glacieret of Mt. Hoffman, and once to Mts. 
Lyell and McClure. I have bagged a quantity of 
Tuolumne rocks sufficient to build a dozen 
Yosemites; stripes of cascades longer than ever, 
lacy or smooth and white as pressed snow; a 
glacier basin with ten glassy lakes set all near 
together like eggs in a nest; then El Capitan and 
a couple of Tissiacks, canons glorious with yellows 
and reds of mountain maple and aspen and honey- 
suckle and ash and new indescribable music im- 
measurable from strange waters and winds, and 
glaciers, too, flowing and grinding, alive as any on 
earth. Shall I pull you out some? Here is a 
clean, white-skinned glacier from the back of 
McClure with glassy emerald flesh and singing 



crystal blood all bright and pure as a sky, yet 
handling mud and stones like a navvy, building 
moraines like a plodding Irishman. Here is a cas- 
cade two hundred feet wide, half a mile long, 
glancing this way and that, filled with bounce and 
dance and joyous hurrah, yet earnest as tempest, 
and singing like angels loose on a frolic from 
heaven; and here are more cascades and more, 
broad and flat like clouds and fringed like flowing 
hair, with occasional falls erect as pines, and lakes 
like glowing eyes; and here are visions and 
dreams, and a splendid set of ghosts, too many for 
ink and narrow paper." 

Pathetic is the earlier record of an accident 
that threatened to incapacitate its victim for 
seeing with full enjoyment such sights as 
those just described. An injury to the right 
eye in those days of work with machines gave 
Mr. Muir what must have been in every sense 
a gloomy month or two; and one is left to 
infer that the impairment of vision was never 
fully made good, though Mrs. Carr's corre- 
spondent was the last person to waste time and 
energy in making moan over the irremediable. 

One closes the letters with a desire for 
more, for later and still richer records of 
varying experience, for intimate interchange 
of thought and personal history with such 
sympathetic friends and co-workers in na- 
ture's laboratory as, for instance, that other 
John of equal fame and kindred tastes, the 
"John of the birds" about whom Dr. Clara 
Barrus has recently written with so much of 
understanding and interpretative skill. Is it 
too much to hope that some such collection of 
later letters may ere long be published? 
Meantime we thank Mrs. Carr for sharing 
with us this feast of good things spread by 
the hand of her gifted friend.

PRAISE OF WAR.* 



Professor Cramb's book on "Germany and 
England," published last fall, aroused such 
interest that it has been deemed worth while 
to reprint a course of lectures he delivered in 
1900, under the stimulus of the Boer war. The 
style and general purpose so closely resemble 
those of the other book, that much of what we 
said in THE DIAL of October 16 last is equally 
applicable here. We are, in fact, impressed 
with the idea that Professor Cramb's intellec- 
tual activities revolved around a single great 
central postulate, which for all practical pur- 
poses he treated as an axiom. A close student 
of recorded history, with all its distortion of 
the true facts of human development, he had 
come to see in Empire the consummation of

man 's destiny, and in war the means whereby 
the highest good might be attained. Thus he 
viewed the modern world through ancient 
spectacles, and interpreted it according to his 
vision. As an extraordinarily able exposition 
of his particular point of view, one which is 
widely shared and is very largely responsible 
for the present war, the work is highly signifi- 
cant. As a revelation of truth or a contribu- 
tion to progress, it appears to have only a 
negative value. 

It would be altogether unjust to Professor 
Cramb to fail to recognize that he was essen- 
tially an idealist, and therefore far removed 
from those who would extend the bounds of 
Empire or wage war for mere material gain. 
After vehemently declaring that the South 
African war was being waged for ideal ends, 
for the good indeed of those to be conquered, 
he refers to another theory in these terms : 

" To assemble a host from all the quarters of this 
wide Empire, to make Africa, as it were, the ren- 
dezvous of the earth, for the sake of a few gold, a 
few diamond mines, what language can equal a 
design thus base, ambition thus sordid? ... No 
man can believe that ; no man, save him whose soul 
faction has sealed in impenetrable night! The 
imagination recoils revolted, terror-struck. Great 
enterprises have ever attracted some base adher- 
ents, and these by their very presence seem to sully 
every achievement recorded of nations or cities. 
But to arraign the fountain and the end of the high 
action because of this baser alloy? To impeach on 
this account all the valour, all the wisdom long 
approved ? Reply is impossible ; the thing simply 
is not British." 

On the positive side, the eloquent descrip- 
tion of Britain 's mission as a world ruler, with 
its acceptance of responsibility for the good of 
the ruled, can hardly fail to awaken some sym- 
pathetic response: 

" But a greater task awaits Britain. Among the 
races of the earth whose fate is already dependent, 
or within a brief period will be dependent upon 
Europe, what empire is to aid them, moving with 
nature, to attain that harmony which Dante dis- 
cerned? What empire, disregarding the mediaeval 
ideal, the effort to impose upon them systems, rites, 
institutions, creeds, to which they are by nature, by 
their history, by inherited pride in the traditions of 
the past, hostile or invincibly opposed, will adven- 
ture the new, the loftier enterprise of development 
[developing?] all that is permanent and divine 
within their own civilizations, institutions, rites and 
creeds? Nature and the dead shall lend their un- 
seen but mighty alliance to such purpose! Thus 
will Britain turn to the uses of humanity the valour 
or the fortune which has brought the religions of 
India and the power of Islam beneath her sway. 
. . . With us, let me repeat, the decision rests, with 
us and with this generation. Never since on Sinai 
God spoke in thunder has mandate more imperative 
been issued to any race, city, or nation than now to 
this nation and to this people. And, again, if we 



should hesitate, or if we should decide wrongly, it 
is not the loss of prestige, it is not the narrower 
bounds we have to fear, it is the judgment of the 
dead and the despair of the living, of the inarticu- 
late myriads who have trusted to us, it is the 
arraigning eyes of the unborn." 

On the other hand : 

" The earthly Paradise of the social reformer, a 
Saint Simon or a Fourier, of a world free from 
war and devoted to agriculture and commerce, or 
of the philosophic evolutionist of a world peopled 
by myriads of happy altruists bounding from bath 
to breakfast-room, illumined and illumining by 
their healthy and mutual smiles, differs from the 
earlier fancies of Asgard and the Isles of the Blest, 
not in heightened nobility and reasonableness, but 
in diminished beauty and poetry." 

Thus the tables are turned upon us, and we 
find ourselves appearing as the apostles of 
material good, ease, or inanity; while Mars 
stands out as the great idealist, and he who 
will not kill may not himself possess life in 
any true sense. It is the art of the conjurer, 
of the skilled lawyer, eagerly presenting that 
part of the case to which the jury must assent, 
then passing rapidly to a conclusion, ignoring 
the non sequitur, and skilfully fooling the 
untrained audience, not nimble-minded enough 
to detect the break in the chain. In the case 
of Professor Cramb, however, the deception is 
doubtless unconscious, and the author of the 
trick has succeeded in deceiving himself. 

What are the actual facts in the case ? It is 
true, in a large sense, that the British Empire 
has been and is in a multitude of ways a benefi- 
cent institution; largely because it has put 
down war and the petty struggle for dominion 
within its boundaries.* Most of us believe, and 
have constantly in our minds at the present 
time, that the ideals of the existing Anglo- 
Saxon race are the best, the most workable, yet 
evolved by any people in the world. We recog- 
nize, of course, that still better ideals lie in the 
lap of the future, inform the minds of the 
most progressive, and tinge the thought of 
multitudes who do not consciously hold them. 
Even these, however, seem to spring out of the 
civilization we have, though they may imply 
great changes in some of our major activities. 
Each one of us, then, is in a sense the soldier of 
an empire of thought which we desire to see 
dominate the world. In many respects, we 
are more aggressive, less modest, than Profes- 
sor Cramb. Humbug is humbug, and error is 
error, and bacteria are no respecters of ancient 
religion. We propose to ourselves nothing 

* A few years ago the reviewer was conversing with an 
educated Hindu, a fervent apostle of " India for the Indians." 
The point was presented, that in pre-British days the people 
of India continually struggled together, and altogether suf- 
fered greatly. Said the Hindu : " Were the British to go, we 
should not be so well governed, but we should prefer to govern 
ourselves, even at the expense of loss of efficiency." This man, 
however, represented a governing class. 



1915] 



THE DIAL

less than the genuine enlightenment of the 
world as to the facts of nature and the ascer- 
tainable natural laws which govern the affairs 
of man. We propose even more than this, 
namely, such reformation of customs and of 
conduct as shall meet the requirements of these 
laws. 

We believe in the struggle for progress; it 
seems to us, as it did to Professor Cramb, that 
if it were ever to come to pass that mankind 
had attained everything worth striving for, 
Nirvana would be the best consummation . The 
postulate is, however, absurd, contrary to all 
experience and reasonable expectation. The 
very fact that a new generation is constantly 
appearing on the stage is an eternal guarantee 
against staleness. The extraordinary expan- 
sion of experience due to modern science does 
but reveal untold vistas ahead. Thus the 
black bogy of the militarists is as unreal as 
any with which nurse ever frightened child. 

Then, as to ideals: we may as well frankly 
recognize that we have an eye on the practical 
thing, even on the bread-and-butter aspect. 
The revolt in philosophy known as pragmatism 
must have its parallel in practical affairs. 
The fallacy that all high emotion, all inflation 
of soul, has some adequate relation to any sort 
of utility must be abandoned. It is the work 
of the genuinely modern idealist to test all 
things, to see the consequences of this or that, 
and act accordingly. Thus the man with the 
microscope and the test-tube, not the man with 
the gun, has the real power to determine 
human fate. 

It is not necessary to declare all war wrong. 
Any one of us can imagine a situation in 
which he would kill a man without hesitation 
and with little regret. Forcible resistance to 
aggression, and the forcible suppression of 
dangerous characters, remain as necessary as 
ever. This, however, is a totally different 
thing from that proposed by Professor Cramb, 
namely, the expansion of Empire through 
war, and a succession of wars to determine 
which of rival Empires is the most alive. That 
is the ancient fallacy, founded in a classical 
education and the distorted presentations of 
historians, which we must do\vn before any 
real democracy is possible. The root of the 
trouble, as we said before, is educational, and 
the question now is whether the modern 
teacher can rise to meet the need and the 
opportunity. At present, on the whole, his 
efforts seem quite inadequate. 

As for the British Empire, everything indi- 
cates that it is going forward along a true 
path of progress, of free cooperation, governed 
by like ideals, not by force. This means 
political disintegration, increasing local au- 



tonomy, and special developments suited to 
local conditions. The United States, by lan- 
guage and by customs, is necessarily part of 
the whole great plan. We quite agree with 
Professor Cramb that a momentous decision 
awaits our race ; but it is not, we hope, to be 
made in the sense he desired. The real ques- 
tion is whether we can develop individuals 
and groups of individuals to the best expres- 
sion of their peculiar powers, without in- 
fringement on the rights of other like persons 
and groups. Can we exercise that eternal 
vigilance, in this case principally over our- 
selves, which is the price of liberty ? If this 
is possible, we need no longer ask ourselves 
whether England or Germany, the United 
States or Canada, Australia, Japan, or China 
is to rule the world in the days to come.

FANTASTIC SOLUTIONS OF SOME 
SHAKESPEAREAN CRUXES.* 



Having read, in the publishers' advertise- 
ment, of Mr. Charles D. Stewart's "astound- 
ing success" in clearing up "the famous 
cruxes which have remained unsolved in 
Shakespeare's plays," "forty of the most 
perplexing passages which have heretofore 
baffled all attempts at explanation," we 
turned eagerly though with misgivings be- 
gotten by the overloud thunderings in the 
index and by recollections of former expe- 
riences to Mr. Stewart's volume and de- 
voured the first chapter, dealing with the 
notorious "runaway's eyes" in "Romeo and 
Juliet. ' ' Our disappointment was greater than 
we had anticipated. But undeterred by the 
author's wholly unwarranted cocksureness, 
contempt for his predecessors, longwinded- 
ness, and other characteristics of juvenility, 
we faithfully and hungeringly read on. 
Disappointment grew keener and keener as 
we read, and steadily the conviction shaped 
itself that here was one of those books that 
had no other excuse for existence than the 
gratification of the author's vanity ("ambi- 
tious ignorance," Mr. Stewart calls it some- 
where) and, perhaps, the ill-advised flattery 
of his friends. 

Mr. Stewart's book is intended, and can be 
intended, only for professed Shakespeare 
scholars; to others the discussion of some of 
the most vexatious and probably corrupt pas- 
sages in Shakespeare's text is of absolutely no 
interest. Only a Shakespeare scholar is com- 
petent to deal with such questions; for the 
discussion of these problems involves a special

and thorough knowledge of the text, not only 
as it is but how it came to be so, of the plays 
as a whole, of psychology, of Elizabethan 
English, and of kindred subjects. Mr. Stew- 
art, we regret to say, not only lacks these 
qualifications but is obsessed with a desire to 
prove that all his predecessors lacked common 
sense and that he alone of all of Shakespeare 's 
readers possesses the ability "to follow 
Shakespeare in his dealings with the deeper 
currents of human nature." But if there is 
any one particular vice of which this latest 
elucidator of Shakespeare's text is guilty it is 
an almost mad desire to vindicate, at all costs, 
the readings of the First Folio, a task that 
has led him into almost as many absurdities 
as the number of difficult passages with which 
he deals. To justify this condemnation of 
Mr. Stewart's methods and results, let us here 
epitomize and analyze a few of his readings 
and interpretations. 

In the first scene of "Antony and Cleo- 
patra" a messenger enters the presence of 
the lovers and this colloquy ensues : 

"Mess. News, my good lord, from Rome. 
Ant. Grates me: the sum. 

Cleo. Nay, hear them, Antony." 

Almost all readers of Shakespeare understand 
from this that Antony is irritated at the ar- 
rival of news from Csesar and Fulvia, and 
that he does not want the messenger to go 
into details but to give a concise summary of 
his message. But this interpretation is too 
easy for Mr. Stewart. He says : 

" Antony's words, ' the sum,' are in answer to 
Cleopatra's foregoing inquiry as to how much he 
loves her. . . . [He] is beginning to expatiate 
upon that pleasant theme, [when] the messenger 

arrives and interrupts him. . . . ' The sum ,' 

he begins, but is again interrupted. The line 
should be printed with a dash after it to indicate 
that he has begun a sentence which is broken off." 

Mr. Stewart's arguments for his emendation 
of the accepted text are that the messenger 
does not immediately answer, that Antony 
seems Kot inclined to listen to him, and that 
Cleopatra enjoins her lover to "hear them." 
But all this shows a complete failure on the 
part of Mr. Stewart to understand this simple 
passage, or to enter into the feelings of the 
characters. Antony, conscious of guilt and 
apprehending the nature of the news, and 
knowing that he must hear it, wants the dis- 
agreeable matter disposed of as quickly as 
possible. Besides, he does not want to show 
Cleopatra that he is afraid to hear the news 
from Rome in her presence. Impatiently and 
f rowningly he asks for the news in a nutshell ; 
whereupen Cleopatra, womanlike, knowing 
what is passing through his mind, finds here 



an excellent opportunity to test the true 
quality of his love and, pretending to be un- 
concerned, she says in effect : ' ' Nay, give 
heedful ear to the messenger." And thus 
this woman of infinite variety, whose mere 
presence is a challenge to her lover to hear his 
wife's message, taunts him into not hearing 
it. Much of this would have been clear to 
Mr. Stewart had he remembered, or known, 
that "to hear" was often employed by the 
Elizabethans in the sense of "to listen pa- 
tiently and attentively." Besides, would 
Shakespeare ever have been guilty of making 
Antony do anything so superfluous and so 
commonplace as to attempt "to tell the 
amount of his love" just after he had said 
"there's beggary in the love that can be 
reckon 'd"? 

Hamlet, meeting a Norwegian Captain at 
the head of some troops marching through 
Denmark, inquires whether these extensive 
and fatal preparations had for their object 
the conquest of Poland, and is told 

" We go to gain a little patch of ground 
That hath in it no profit but the name. 
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it." 

Mr. Stewart objects to the punctuation of the 
last verse. He says that according "to the 
generally accepted interpretation the Captain 
is supposed to be saying that he would not 
undertake to farm it to make a total profit of 
five ducats, and to be repeating the 'five' sim- 
ply to impress that amount on Hamlet's 
mind. But this is to miss the whole sense and 
spirit of the line." After some platitudinous 
comments on the nature of capital, he comes 
to the conclusion that the line should be 
printed "to pay five ducats five," because 
"an investment with no result but to pay 
five ducats five would be the reductlo ab- 
surdum [sic] of investment." In other 
words, it would be absurd to invest five ducats 
if the venture did not result in a profit. A 
better illustration of a simple passage dis- 
torted beyond recognition we could not find 
in a summer's day, or a better example of the 
author's perverse method of studying Shake- 
speare, of his unfair dealing with his prede- 
cessors, of his utter inability to shed light on 
Shakespeare, and of his skill in smelling out 
cruxes where no one else ever suspected that 
any lurked. We challenge Mr. Stewart to 
name a single editor, critic, or commentator 
who gives the above-quoted paraphrase of the 
Captain's words. To every ordinary intelli- 
gence the Captain says exactly what the situa- 
tion demands, viz., that the patch of ground 
for which they are going to fight and for 
which so many valiant men are ready to lay 
down their lives is so insignificant per se that

he would not pay five ducats, not even five, a 
year for the privilege of farming it and taking 
the revenue from it. The "five" is repeated 
to emphasize his contempt for it. 

Let us now turn our attention to a passage 
which does really present some difficulties to 
the critics, although it is not generally classed 
among the cruxes. After the fortune-hunting 
Bassanio had luckily chosen the prize casket, 
Gratiano asks his consent to be married too. 
"With all my heart," says the happy Bas- 
sanio, "so thou canst get a wife." Gratiano 
replies : 

" I thank your lordship, you have got me one. 
My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours : 
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid ; 
You loved, I loved ; for intermission 
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you." 

Most modern scholarly editions of "The Mer- 
chant of Venice" print this passage as we 
have here given it. Mr. Stewart, however, 
with a few modern editors, proposes to read 
the last two verses as follows : 
" You loved, I loved for intermission. 
No more pertains to me, my lord, than you." 

His interpretation of the passage is unique. 
After a long discussion he comes to this con- 
clusion (p. 177) : 

" What Gratiano means by this last line must be 
evident enough. It is simply his way of saying, 
by way of graceful compliment [Gratiano graceful 
and complimentary!], that he has not gone outside 
of Bassanio's household for a wife. When Bas- 
sanio won Portia, her household was annexed to 
his own, and this included the maid Nerissa 
[Nerrissa a maid!] ; thus the one who pertains in 
so momentous a relation to Gratiano also pertains 
to Bassanio. Gratiano is allowing Bassanio to 
guess the truth while he approaches it with these 
general statements ; and in his large point of view 
' no more pertains to me than you,' there is the 
fine implication that it has always been thus 
between them. Even in his marriage he has not 
gone outside of his master's [ !] circle of interests; 
they are now bound by a further tie." 
To our thinking, if there was any such stuff 
in Gratiano 's mind it would require not only 
the astuteness of the proverbial Philadelphia 
lawyer but of the whole Philadelphia bar to 
find it in the words quoted. Staunton, whose 
reading is that championed by our author, 
gives a far more satisfactory interpretation 
of the last line, viz. : " I owe my wife as much 
to you as to my own efforts. ' ' 

Satisfied that the words "No more pertains 
to me," etc., may stand as an independent 
sentence, and that it therefore does so, and 
that it is "in strict keeping with the speaker's 
character," Mr. Stewart concludes (he is 
nothing if not logical) that "the preceding 
line is a statement by itself with a full stop 



after 'intermission.' ' And this is how he 
interprets "I loved for intermission": 

" Here Gratiano gracefully acknowledges that 
his own love affair is quite secondary, in impor- 
tance, to that of his master. It is figuratively 
referred to as a mere time-filling or stop-gap per- 
formance, ... a mere side-issue, quite subordi- 
nate to the main event. . . . And this is quite in 
keeping with the self-sacrificing [!] and devoted 
[ !] character which he upholds." 
And this is the interpretation which Mr. 
Stewart modestly claims "settles the mean- 
ing so positively that there can be no more 
doubt in the matter"! And, quite true to 
himself, he again falsifies the interpretations 
of former commentators. He says: "Those 
who render the passage so that it reads 'for 
intermission no more pertains to me than you' 
explain it as meaning that Bassanio was in- 
cessant in love-making, and that Gratiano 
was the same, . . . that Bassanio was always 
at it and that his man Gratiano was just like 
him always at it. ' ' This is a complete mis- 
representation of Theobald's, Furness's, and 
others' interpretation. Theobald said that 
"intermission" means "standing idle," and 
all readers of Shakespeare Mr. Stewart only 
excepted understand Gratiano to say "that 
he could not be idle, that he had to be doing 
something, and that as he had nothing else to 
do he made love to Nerrissa." And this is 
certainly preferable to having Gratiano, a 
gentleman and an intimate friend of Bas- 
sanio 's, say before Nerrissa, who is a lady as 
well born and as well bred as Portia, that his 
love was only a time-filling performance. 
Besides, with Mr. Stewart's punctuation and 
definition of "intermission," Gratiano is 
really made to say (to ordinary intelligences) 
that he and his friend loved only as a pas- 
time, that sincerity in love pertains to him no 
more than to Bassanio. With the generally 
accepted text Gratiano says, in effect: "You 
came and saw and wooed, and so did I; my 
eyes can look as swift as yours, and I am not 
a bit 'slower' than you are." 

It must not be inferred from what has pre- 
ceded that Mr. Stewart's interpretations are 
always wrong. Now and then he is quite 
right, as, for instance, in the explanation of 
the word "ringlets" in the beautiful verse in 
the "Midsummer Night's Dream" in which 
Titania speaks of the fairies dancing their 
ringlets to the whistling wind. Curiously 
enough, both Wright and Furness failed mis- 
erably in their understanding of this line. 
Wright said "ringlets" meant the little cir- 
cular plots of grass known as "fairy rings." 
To this interpretation Dr. Furness objected, 
because fairy rings do not grow "in the 
beached margent of the sea"; in his opinion 



300 



THE DIAL 



[April 15 



Titania meant only that the fairies dance to 
the accompaniment of the whistling wind 
which meanwhile blows through their curly 
locks. And now Mr. Stewart assures us that 
Titania means no more than that the fairies 
danced in tiny circles. The only trouble with 
this interpretation is that it comes too late. 
Had Mr. Stewart looked no further than into 
''The Century Dictionary" he would have 
found this very passage quoted in illustration 
of the definition "circles" for "ringlets." 
Dr. Chambers, in the "Arden" edition of the 
"Midsummer Night's Dream," dismisses the 
whole thing in less than a line, thus : ' ' ring- 
lets, not curls, but dances in a ring"; whereas 
Mr. Stewart devotes considerably more than 
two pages to this bit of old news. 

A better example of Mr. Stewart's fantas- 
tic and supersubtle method of dealing with 
Shakespeare's text than the following can 
scarcely be found anywhere. That celebrated 
quartet, Jackson, Seymour, Chedworth, and 
Becket, whose tamperings with Shakespeare 
are living monuments of misingenuity and 
wasted energy, never perpetrated anything 
more impossible than Mr. Stewart in his dis- 
cussion of this passage in the "All's "Well" : 

" you leaden messengers, 
That ride upon the violent speed of fire, 
Fly with false aim : move the still-piecing air 
That sings with piercing." (A. W., iii, 2, 111-114.) 
"Still-piecing," meaning "ever-closing, clos- 
ing immediately," is Malone's generally ac- 
cepted substitute for "still-peering" of the 
First Folio. This almost certain emendation 
is supported by several passages in Shake- 
speare which speak of the air as being wound- 
less, invulnerable, intrenchant, etc., as well as 
by the words "the still-closing waters" in 
"The Tempest." And Verplanck quotes as 
a very apt illustration of the passage, and as 
a possible "source" for it, the following from 
the apocryphal book of "The Wisdom of 
Solomon " : "As when an arrow is shot at a 
mark, it parteth the air which immediately 
cometh together again, so that a man cannot 
know where it cometh through." Besides, 
"peering" is a very likely misprint or mis- 
reading for "peecing," an Elizabethan va- 
riant for ' ' piecing. ' ' This is how Mr. Stewart 
wrings a meaning out of the Folio text : 

"Peering, as here used, is a verb form of the 
noun peer, meaning an equal. In war (the present 
connection) a man's peer would be one whom he 
could not overcome. Still-peering air means that 
the air, despite the leaden missiles that pierce it, 
is ever unconquered, always unvanquished in- 
vulnerable. . . . And so ' still-peering air ' regards 
the atmosphere as always and ever the equal of 
these leaden missiles of war, inconquerable, in- 
vulnerable." 



And this is the explanation that, po Mr. 
Stewart tells us, makes the passage ' ' as open 
to sense as any the commonest and plainest 
English that Shakespeare ever wrote"! It is 
a pity that our author has omitted to specify 
to an admiring world in what respect a bullet 
or leaden messenger of death is invulnerable 
and unconquerable. 

Hamlet, as we know, is one great crux. It 
might therefore be confidently predicted that 
one so gifted with a genius for making cruxes, 
big and little, vanish into thin air as is Mr. 
Stewart would surely contribute his mite to 
the solution of the Hamlet mystery. And so 
he does. But he is not content with throwing, 
a little light on the vexatious questions which 
we associate with the melancholy Prince; in 
a short chapter of twenty-six duodecimo pages 
printed in large type, he removes Hamlet 
wholly and for ever from the sphere of the 
problematical. The occupation of the Ham- 
let commentator is gone ! We shall quote only 
a few sentences from this chapter, leaving it 
to the curious to read more in the original : 

" Strange ' inconsistencies ' arise to puzzle the 
commentators. All these are easily explainable. 
We cannot, however, make the least progress in 
the understanding of the true inwardness of the 
play until we have realized that Hamlet is a man 
who has been incapacitated to have emotion. . . . . 
To witness a display of emotion upon the part of 
others was a torture to him because it reminded 
him of the faculty which he had lost. It made him 
feel poignantly the difference between himself and 
other men, a terrible state of isolation; and not 
only that, it confronted him continually with a 
live contrast between his former self and the man 
he had now become. . . . He makes a grand effort 
at passionate feeling. . . . Hamlet lives in the 
cold light of reason, bereft of all other relief, 
[and] is quite at home in a deep, canny piece of 
detective work. . . . The most tragic phase of his 
situation in life to be a dead self. . . . His emo- 
tions are but a memory. . . . The whole world 
outfaced Hamlet because his insights had placed 
him in a terrible isolation; he was a man apart 
from the race. . . . Hamlet was haunted by his 
dead self. . . . Hamlet is not a mystery." 

Had Mr. Stewart devoted himself to the 
study of Shakespeare, English grammar, and 
psychology, with half the zeal that he has 
devoted to discovering cruxes and to distort- 
ing Shakespeare's meaning, he would not have 
been guilty of many of the lesser errors that 
mar his book. There is no excuse for speak- 
ing of Gratiano as Bassanio's "man," of 
Nerrissa as a "maid" ( Gratiano 's "maid" 
differs in meaning from Mr. Stewart's), of 
Bassanio as Gratiano 's "master." And one 
has read his "Romeo and Juliet" very super- 
ficially who speaks of the masked ball in Act 
i., Scene 5, as a "wedding feast." The obso-

lete expression "insight of," which occurs 
frequently in this book, sounds very harsh to 
a modern ear. In one place (p. 219) we read 
of a "terrible [sic] deep insight of the hypoc- 
risy of mankind," and in another (p. 166) 
we find this sentence: "The human mind is 
just that superstitious." In the statement 
(p. 148) that "we only hope in a case of 
doubt" the psychology is worse than the 
English. 

Whatever this book is, it is not helpful to 
the Shakespeare student. 

SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM. 



OLD MAGIC IN A XEW CEXTURY.* 



It is not uncommonly remarked that the 
new magic of a scientific age transcends the 
wonder of the old magic of a time outworn. 
The miracles of wireless telegraphy and radio- 
activity, though fast becoming commonplaces 
of efficiency, still retain a place of honor among 
amateurs. The assumption, however, that the 
Old Magic has actually passed, that it has 
utterly faded out before the new sun, is de- 
cidedly unwarranted by the facts, especially 
the bibliography of the last few years. 

The activities of the Psychical Research So- 
ciety do not so much constitute a new science 
as they aim to investigate some of the material 
of ancient magic. The Spiritualist Societies, 
Christian Science, Theosophy, Swedenborgian- 
ism, all these have more than a trace of 
sorcery in them. The revival of Buddhism is 
significant. M. Maeterlinck, ultra-modern 
though he is in " Our Eternity, ' ' exhibits him- 
self as a spiritual atavist in "The Unknown 
Guest." Such books as Bayley's "Lost Lan- 
guage of Symbolism," Jacks 's "All Men Are 
Ghosts," and Rohmer 's "Romance of Sor- 
cery" speak eloquently of the vitality of the 
Old Magic. Indeed we are not sure but that 
Pragmatism has been quietly insinuating a 
kind of philosophical apology for the pre- 
sumably unscientific. 

"The Romance of Sorcery" is written not 
for the adept, not even for the student, but 
for Everyman, the aim being "to bring out 
the red blood of the subject." This the author 
has succeeded in doing, despite the difficulties 
in his path. The enormous mass of erudition 
that he must have investigated is appalling, 
and it is therefore not surprising that the 
book leaves the impression of a scrappy his- 
tory of palaeontology, with vast ages unrepre- 
sented. The author's attitude toward his 
task, as also his conception of his work, has 
undeniably the defects of its virtues. Be-

lieving that enough serious essays and his- 
tories and enough lives of great magicians 
have been written, he aims at romance, the 
dramatic, the pathetic, even the humorous. 
Not himself an adept, he is thoroughly recep- 
tive to the facts of sorcery, and sympathetic 
toward all the characters he presents. Though 
he tries hard to be fair, and speaks in a re- 
strained and guarded tone which at times is 
exceedingly effective, the absence of direct 
citation of authority, especially in the earlier 
chapters dealing with the birth of sorcery, 
"ginns," "sibyls," " elementals, " oriental 
oracles, and so forth, cannot fail to arouse 
suspicion in the mind of a reader with the 
slightest critical turn. References are always 
of the most general nature ; there are no foot- 
notes, no citation of chapters or pages. Some- 
times he tells us, sometimes he leaves us to 
guess, the name of the author upon whom he 
relies; Philostratus presumably provides the 
information concerning Apollonius of Tyana, 
but it would be more satisfactory to know just 
where to look for confirmation of the story of 
the raising of the Roman maid from her 
funeral bier. Historical romances have been 
commonly condemned as neither good history 
nor good fiction, and in like manner Mr. 
Rohmer may tread on his own toes. His pur- 
pose is not solely or even largely entertain- 
ment; he aims to persuade. And persuasion 
rests upon conviction. 

In the first chapter, "Sorcery and the Sor- 
cerers," there is much curious information 
concerning Eliphas Levi, who "may justly be 
called the last of the sorcerers," and his 
"Magical Ritual"; also the famous "Magus 
or Celestial Intelligencer" by Francis Barrett. 
Of Apollonius of Tyana the author says: 
"There is so much of the marvellous in the 
life of the man of Tyana, that if I am to 
begin by doubting the possession by Apol- 
lonius of supernatural powers, I can see no 
end to my doubts other than that of doubting 
that he ever existed at all." Certainly this 
august Pythagorean philosopher, whose re- 
corded life presents so many analogies to that 
of Socrates and Jesus, makes a worthy study. 

Michel de Notre Dame, called Nostradamus, 
represents the magic of the sixteenth century. 
Since there is no life in English of this great 
wonder-working physician (1503-1566), the 
author devotes considerable space to him in 
this book. The evidence here is more satis- 
factory, and shows Nostradamus to have been 
a remarkable divinator. His "Centuries," in 
rhymed quatrains, published in 1555, contain 
many predictions more or less verifiable. In 
1792 there was to be a "revision of cen- 
turies," followed by various reforms by the

people. This may have been merely a happy 
guess, but not often is a guess so accurate two 
and a half centuries in advance. The death 
of Henry II., the advent of Henry IV., and 
the execution "by the senate of London" of 
Charles I. are all foretold in fairly unequivocal 
terms. 

The chequered career of Dr. John Dee 
(1527-1608), Fellow of Cambridge and Lou- 
vain, and intimate of Queen Elizabeth, is 
handled sympathetically, though with an air 
of tolerant condescension, for the author 
thinks Dr. Dee was very much the dupe of 
Edward Kelly, "the most sinister figure in 
the annals of alchemistical philosophy," the 
man who claimed to have found the ivory 
caskets of St. Dunstan, containing the red and 
white powders necessary to the composition 
of the Philosopher's Stone. 

Cagliostro appears in entertaining but fairly 
authentic guise as a man of great accomplish- 
ments, if lacking the genuineness of Nostrada- 
mus. The opinion of Lavater, the physiog- 
nomist, is cited in conclusion : "I believe that 
Nature produces a form like his only once in 
a century, and I could weep blood to think 
that so rare a production of nature should, by 
the many objections he has furnished against 
himself, be partly so much misconceived, and 
partly, by so many harshnesses and cruelties, 
have given just cause for offence." Lorenza, 
the "Countess," moves through the account 
with a tragic beauty she may not have actually 
possessed. 

For associating Madame Blavatsky with 
sorcerers the author says he has already been 
taken to task. His answer is that many phe- 
nomena (a term which he singularly uses in 
the sense of "strange occurrences") con- 
nected with her career are legitimately in the 
realms of sorcery. Here, of course, we have 
purely a question of phraseology. Soldau, in 
his "History of Witchcraft," says: "Sorcery 
is illegal miracle, and miracle legitimate sor- 
cery." Ennemoser says in the preface to his 
"History of Magic," still excellent even if 
archaic : ' ' The Fathers of the Church looked 
upon the heathen oracles, and the heathens on 
the Christian miracles, as sorcery. ' ' 

Mr. Bohmer chooses to make "sorcery" 
cover the entire field of mystical and super- 
natural : ' ' By sorcery I understand, and in- 
tend to convey, all those doctrines concerning 
the nature and power of angels and spirits; 
the methods of evoking shades of departed 
persons ; the conjuration of elementary spirits 
and of demons ; the production of any kind of 
supernormal phenomena ; the making of talis- 
mans, potions, wands, etc. ; divination and 
chrystallomancy ; and Cabalistic and cere- ! 



monial rites. " It is evident from this that all 
of what Ennemoser calls true mysticism, "the 
direct relation of the human mind to God, ' ' as 
well as lower and superficial manifestations, 
true knowledge or vision adulterated with 
cunning and greed, are considered together as 
having a common essence. 

This unification of all these phenomena 
seems to be justified. It is the amalgam of 
false and true, of vision and cunning, of 
White and Black Art, that makes the whole 
subject such a mass of contradictions and 
anomalies. For this very reason, also, it is 
surviving in an age of scientific curiosity.

THE CASE AGAINST GERMANY.* 



It can scarcely be doubted that the most 
trustworthy and informing books on the pres- 
ent war have come from the neutral countries, 
especially from America. Where passion is 
not engaged, discernment is inevitably clearer. 
Thus, the keenest studies of the diplomatic 
preliminaries are from the American writer, 
Beck, and the Italian, Ferrero. If these men 
unite in finding a verdict of "aggression" 
against Germany and Austria, we may be sure 
it is not owing to national prejudice but sim- 
ply because the facts are so. Indeed, so far 
as the immediate occasion of the war is con- 
cerned, the case may be said to be virtually 
closed. Even German newspapers and public 
speakers are now frequently referring to the 
struggle as a " preventive war, ' ' waged by the 
Fatherland to forestall a possible future at- 
tack by the Entente powers. 

Among recent American books dealing with 
Germany's part in the great struggle, Mr. 
Oswald Garrison Villard's "Germany Embat- 
tled" is the weightiest, not merely because of 
its grave tone and solemnly drawn conclusions, 
but also because it is a unique blending of 
sympathy for the German people and their 
aspirations with unqualified reprobation of the 
motives and methods of the German govern- 
ment in precipitating the war. The son of a 
German mother, an officer of the Deutscher 
Verein in his Harvard days, Mr. Villard has 
for many years been a close student of German 
conditions. He summarizes admirably the Ger-

man point of view in the introductory pages 
of his book, and then coldly demonstrates the 
impossibility of American approval. The fail- 
ure of the insistent propaganda in this country 
is emphasized and the desirability of our re- 
torting by a campaign of enlightenment in 
Germany is suggested. It would be well if 
this education might begin at home, and if 
those German- Americans who have fed them- 
selves since the war began with the offerings 
of the "Staats-Zeitung" and its colleagues 
could be induced to read this book. But that 
is perhaps a too fond hope. 

Mr. Villard finds that the menace of Ger- 
many to modern civilization proceeds from 
autocracy and militarism. His chapter on 
" Militarism -and Democracy" is the clearest 
exposition we have seen of the way the soldier 
dominates the civilian in Prussianized Ger- 
many. Militarism as a result of autocracy is 
the text of Mr. William Harbutt Dawson's 
* ' What Is Wrong with Germany ? ' ' The writ- 
er 's answer to his own question may be stated 
succinctly thus : Germany is out of harmony 
with the rest of the world because, owing to 
the lack of popular control in her parliament, 
the government is in the hands of a military 
clique. The author has no difficulty in show- 
ing that Germany has only the semblance of a 
parliamentary government, that the Reichs- 
tag is a mere "hall of echoes," and that the 
real driving force is the Federal Council, ap- 
pointed by the princes of the various states. 
Mr. Dawson is perhaps the best-informed man 
now writing in English on matters pertaining 
to certain aspects of German economics and 
administration. In his new book there is some 
threshing over of old straw, with talk of 
Treitschke, Bernhardi, and Nietzsche; but 
there is also a vast amount of new information, 
well documented, concerning the growth of 
Pan-Germanism as reflected in press and par- 
liament. Not the least interesting chapter 
contains a list of the bellicose utterances of the 
Kaiser, which cumulatively constitute a for- 
midable refutation of the claim that he has 
T)een a man of peace. 

In comparison with Mr. Dawson 's book, the 
slender volume entitled "Germany and 
Europe, ' ' by Mr. J. W. Allen of the University 
of London, seems commonplace. It appears to 
have been written in the early stages of the 
war, and offers nothing new. Only its equable 
temper may be commended. 

Mr. John Jay Chapman's little book, 
^'Deutschland iiber Alles," is a collection of 
the utterances of representative Germans in 
defence of the policies of their country since 
it went to war. It is the compiler 's belief that 
Germany is suffering from an obsession, a 



collective madness combined of persecution 
mania and the folie des grandeurs. This 
theory, which is more suggestive than con- 
vincing, would possess greater cogency if the 
quoted utterances had not all been made in the 
heat of passion after the conflict was kindled. 
Certain spokesmen of all the belligerents have 
said things which they will doubtless regret 
when calmer days come. The late Dr. Emil 
Reich, an anglicized Austrian, wrote a book a 
few years ago to show that Germany was suf- 
fering from megalomania. His numerous 
quotations from books, speeches, etc., carry 
some weight precisely because they were not 
words uttered in haste or fury but were pre- 
sumably intended at their face value. For the 
same reason, "Germany's War Mania," a 
compilation made in England, possesses inter- 
est as a collection of ante-bellum documents. 
In addition to writers usually quoted, General 
von der Goltz and Professor Delbriick are here 
put on record in defence of militarism. The 
evolution of the Crown Prince from an innocu- 
ous nondescript into a rather objectionable 
jingo is also concisely traced. 

Dr. Edmund von Mach has rendered the 
American public a service by translating Paul 
Rohrbach's "Der deutsche Gedanke in der 
Welt," which first appeared in 1912 and has 
since gone through many editions. The trans- 
lation bears the title, "German World Poli- 
cies," and though somewhat "edited" for 
American consumption, reproduces substan- 
tially the original. Rohrbach may be de- 
scribed as a moderate imperialist. Fearing 
that the world is becoming predominantly 
Anglo-Saxon, he calls upon his people reso- 
lutely to assert themselves so that they may 
not be left out of the reckoning. The motive, 
it is to be observed, is not economic but politi- 
cal. Germany's resources are sufficient, he 
thinks, to support a population much larger 
than her present, her trade ought to continue 
to expand as heretofore, her emigration is 
negligible, she is even obliged each year to 
import labor. There is, then, no urgent eco- 
nomic need of expansion. But the task to 
which Germany must address herself is that 
of spreading her language, her civilization and 
its influences, her Kultur (to use a word that 
has lately been soiled by all ignoble use), to 
the ends of the world. The author holds this 
to be a cardinal necessity if Germany is not to 
be recreant to her native strength. And for 
this high destiny colonies and spheres of influ- 
ence are essential. With many of these aspira- 
tions a neutral may readily sympathize, 
especially as Rohrbach, unlike Bernhardi, does 
not advocate aggressive warfare. He has even a 
keen eye for German faults. Speaking of the

failure of his country to placate Poles, Danes, 
and Alsatians, lie remarks upon the German 
"inability to make moral conquests" for 
which ' ' the North German character is most to 
blame. ' ' There can be no doubt that Rohrbach 
rather than Bernhardi represented the feel- 
ings of the majority of Germans before the 
outbreak of the war. All the more pity that 
the government chose the Pan-Germanic path.

RECENT FICTION.* 



Ho for the Spanish Main in the brave days 
of the buccaneers ! The ringing call comes to 
our ears with "The Gentleman Adventurer," 
by Mr. H. C. Bailey, a romancer who has 
proved his quality on several previous occa- 
sions. Here is a pirate story calculated to 
quicken the most jaded sense and to stir the 
most sluggish blood. It tells of Peter Hayle, 
implicated out of good nature in a plot against 
the life of Dutch William in 1695, and making 
a hasty exit from England to save his neck. 
He is shanghaied in London, taken to the West 
Indies and sold as a slave, and there, escaping 
from servitude in the company of a burly 
ruffian named Luke Veal, captures a ship, runs 
up the Jolly Roger, and carves out for himself 
piratical fame. He is a considerate buccaneer, 
who never scuttles a ship for the fun of the 
thing, and his chief exploit is the putting out 
of business of Estevan, a pirate of the most 
reprehensible sort, whose villainies make 
Peter 's gorge rise and inspire him with loath- 
ing. Estevan is ruler of a private pirate king- 
dom on the coast of Honduras, and his store of 
treasure suffices to set Peter up for life when 
he returns to England and his erstwhile hon- 
est existence. The tale is romantic in the 
extreme ; the French maiden whom Peter res- 
cues is taken home as his wife, while the 
serpent- woman, the mistress of Peter and Luke 
in their days of slavery, kidnapped by them 
and wedded to Luke, seeks to betray her lord 
and master to Estevan, and is properly slain 
in the ensuing fight, another woman having 
already appeared upon the scene to fill the 
place thus made vacant. The book has an 
ingenious fertility of invention, and a raciness 
of style that is a constant delight. 

"Bealby" is the best fun that Mr. H. G. 
Wells has given us since "Ann Veronica," and 
it is sheer unadulterated fun beyond anything 
that could be claimed for that startling por-

traiture of the New Young Woman. In fact, 
the genuine creative talent of Mr. Wells is bet- 
ter exhibited by his studies of "life among the 
lowly" by his Lewisham, Polly, and Kipps 
than by all his sociological vaticinations and 
his monotonous criticism of the way in which 
the world chooses at present to conduct its 
affairs. Bealby is just a small boy of twelve 
or so, a gardener's stepson put out to service 
in the household of a local magnate. He goes 
unwillingly to the scene of his labors, and 
things begin to happen as soon as he gets there. 
It is something to plunge a toasting-fork into 
the face of an under-butler. but this deed pales 
into insignificance when the boy, in his pre- 
cipitate flight from the wrath otherwise to 
come, upsets the Lord Chancellor (at that 
moment a week-end guest), and forces from 
the latter 's lips a word euphemistically de- 
scribed as ' ' one brief topographical cry. ' ' The 
Lord Chancellor has had a rasping experience 
already, and is not in the best of tempers ; the 
encounter with Bealby is the last camel we 
mean the last straw and hastens his depar- 
ture from that hospitable roof with anathema 
in his heart. Bealby also thinks it wise to 
depart, naturally with the utmost secrecy, and 
thus enters upon a veritable odyssey of adven- 
ture. He attaches himself for a few days to a 
party of three ladies engaged in a care-free 
tour of the countryside in a caravan; then, 
getting into further trouble, takes a new flight 
and sets by the ears the population of a neigh- 
boring town already posted with bills offering 
a reward for his capture. He is finally seized 
and taken to the Lord Chancellor to explain 
the innocent cause of the original offending, 
but his lordship does not believe a word of the 
confession, and sputters anew the conviction 
that he has been made the victim of a damna- 
ble conspiracy. Finally, Bealby, much chas- 
tened, returns to the step-parental roof, and 
begs to be allowed another chance. This rol- 
licking story has many other elements of 
interest the romance of the officer and the 
actress-lady of the caravan, the tramp with 
whom the boy consorts and eventually "does," 
and Lord Chickney, who tries to figure as deus 
ex machina, and distinctly does not succeed in 
straightening out the tangle. It is all broadly 
farcical, of course, but it keeps the interest 
sharpened at every juncture, and the author 
resists measurably the temptation to digress 
into social homiletics. 

It was a safe prediction that many months 
would not pass before Mr. Will Levington 
Comfort seized the occasion offered by the 
world-war for a novel upon that engrossing 
theme. "Red Fleece" is not the big work 
that he might have written had he taken longer

about it, or that he probably will give us in the 
future, but as an impressionistic preliminary 
sketch it is very acceptable. Its hero is an 
American newspaper correspondent, and its 
action is upon the Austrian frontier. Its bat- 
tle-pictures suggest to us those of "The Red 
Badge of Courage," although they are not 
evolved, as Crane's were, from the inner con- 
sciousness of the writer, for Mr. Comfort has 
seen war at first hand, and knows all its 
ghastliness. Since this knoAvledge is combined 
with an intense missionary zeal in behalf of 
human brotherhood, and deep sympathy for 
the hapless lives reared only to become 
Kanonenf utter, Mr. Comfort's message is de- 
livered with poignancy and force, and his 
didacticism is hardly of the censurable sort. 
The habitual mysticism of his treatment of 
woman is once more exemplified in this novel, 
and Berthe Wyndham is a worthy addition to 
his gallery of consecrated souls. Our old 
friend Fallows of "Down Among Men" reap- 
pears in these pages, and preaches his good old 
gospel of the cause of the People. As a stylist, 
Mr. Comfort has never done better work. 
* l His clothing smelled of death ; and one morn- 
ing before the smoke fell, he watched the sun 
shining upon the pine-clad hills. That mo- 
ment the thought held him that the pine trees 
were immortal, and men just the dung of the 
earth. " It is not given to many men to write 
such English as that. 

If Mr. Willem de Veer, the Dutch author 
of "An Emperor in the Dock," were to set 
foot on German soil, we tremble at the thought 
of what would happen to him. The ordinary 
penalties for lese-majeste would clearly be 
inadequate, and "something lingering" would 
have to be devised for his special case. The 
title of this book arouses pleasurable anticipa- 
tions, which are, however, not realized, as the 
author is evidently an amateur, and his yarn 
is badly written, and devoid of all probability. 
Such as it is. we may recount it in brief out- 
line. Two Englishmen are fishing in Norway 
when the war breaks out, and accept the invi- 
tation of a Dutch yachtsman to be his guests 
on th'e homeward voyage. One of the boat's 
officers is a German spy, who does his best to 
cripple the yacht on its way back. Presently 
it encounters a German cruiser, which gives 
chase, but soon comes to grief when its career 
is ended by a mine. The yacht speeds to the 
rescue of the survivors, and picks up two 
drowning men, who are taken aboard. One of 
them is discovered to be "The Disturber of 
the "World's Peace in propria persona"; the 
other is his devoted attache. The distin- 
guished visitors are locked up, but contrive to 
break loose from their cabin, and, with the aid 



of the German spy already mentioned, seek to 
gain command of the yacht, incidentally com- 
mitting murder in the attempt. An im- 
promptu court is organized for the trial of 
the imperial offender, who is obliged to listen 
to some very plain speaking about his own 
character, and who, "with an expression on 
his face of mingled prussic acid and disdain," 
replies to his accusers with what one of the 
children in "The Golden Age" calls "horrid 
implications." When the subject of his con- 
duct has been thoroughly inquired into by the 
court, the decision as to whether he shall be 
set free or hanged as a pirate is decided in 
favor of clemency, and he is landed at a Dutch 
port. The treatment of this highly dramatic 
material is meant to be serious, but it hardly 
escapes being burlesque. The dock in which 
the case of this Exalted Person is eventually 
adjudicated will, we imagine, prove an entirely 
different affair. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

Given a good-looking man of New England up- 
bringing, who is afraid of women to the point of 
avoidance of them, and has no just notion of what 
to do with them when he has passed the point of 
avoidance, and " A Reluctant Adam " (Houghton) 
stands forth in Mr. Sidney Williams's novel of that 
name. It is a recital of the rather pawky hero's 
love affairs, from adolescent spooning down to a 
suddenly acquired and as suddenly dismissed 
grande passion which comes to nothing whatever. 
Though there remains a feeling that it serves him 
right, so brief a time and space are allotted this 
latter episode in the narrative that a sense of dis- 
appointment remains. The protagonist seems to 
be a man without either respect for womankind or 
the code of a gentleman to keep him out of mis- 
chief, and he deserves to have his punishment made 
more explicit. 

"Barbara's Marriages" (Harper), by Mrs. 
Maude Eadford Warren, has been written with the 
earnest desire to cast light upon the vast problem 
of love, in and out of marriage. The heroine is of 
an excellent Virginia family that has somewhat 
gone to seed. Her first lover is much her elder, and 
is killed so soon after marriage that she may be 
said not to have been married at all. Her second 
lover is as disagreeable a cad as one is likely to 
meet, who exhibits a supermannish selfishness in 
his love that makes one wonder why he should have 
consented to a secret marriage. He is duly divorced ; 
but there is a child to come, of which he is igno- 
rant. The third matrimonial engagement is with 
a gentleman of Barbara's own class, a lifelong 
friend. The interest of the book is in the second 
affair, the last being rather carelessly developed. 

The Union of South Africa is intimately treated 
in Mr. F. E. Mills Young's " Valley of a Thousand 
Hills" (Lane). A young Englishman seeking a 



306

new career as manager of a cattle-growing estate, 
and a daughter of the Boers with more education 
than her parents, play the leading parts. Much of 
the laxity of living which crops out where widely 
differing civilizations meet and mingle on frontiers 
is written into the narrative. The disagreeable 
part in the story is taken by a young native of 
English blood who is weak rather than vicious, the 
hero supplanting him in the affections of the beauti- 
ful Dutch girl. The dramatic climax comes with 
the uprising of the Hindu coolies in Natal, which 
permits discussion of the racial difficulties almost 
certain to appear when Asiatics are admitted to 
Caucasian communities in numbers. The book is 
admirably put together. 

A rare figure is the protagonist of Mrs. Eleanor 
Atkinson's "Johnny Appleseed" (Harper). That 
the American wilderness a hundred years ago 
should have given birth to lives of fine self-sacrifice 
was to be expected; but here was a man with a 
sense of social service such as the world is still more 
than a hundred years away from. Jonathan Chap- 
man was, and must have been, a New Englander. 
He conceived the idea of going about through the 
new settlements of the central west and planting 
appleseeds, that the children of the pioneers might 
have the joy of orchards. He devoted a life to it, 
and few lives have been better or more profitably 
spent. Mrs. Atkinson's pages show much research, 
and bring to life a figure and a time which should 
never be forgotten. 

In America, such a title as Mr. Oliver Onions 
has given his new book, "Mushroom Town" 
(Doran), would mean something in the oil regions, 
or mining regions, or other newly opened terri- 
tory, which had grown up in a day, as Okla- 
homa City did, for example. In more leisurely 
Wales, with all the assistance England can afford, 
it takes thirty years or thereabouts to turn the 
sleepy village of Llanyglo into a lively and popu- 
lar seaside resort. How it was done, and what 
was the effect upon both early inhabitants and pro- 
moters, is told with vivacity and discernment. 
Incidentally one learns a good deal about the 
Welsh people, who have played an astonishingly 
small part in English fiction hitherto. 

When out of sorts with the world, especially 
with the world of city-life, such a book as Mr. 
Walter Prichard Eaton's " The Idyl of Twin Fires " 
(Doubleday) may be taken as both a sedative 
and an alterative. " Twin Fires " is the name 
n weary instructor in English, escaped to a New 
England hillside farm, gives to his place on the 
suggestion of a girl doctor of philology who comes 
to a neighboring boarding-house. How the old 
house is made better and lovelier than new, how the 
landscape is made beautiful, the garden glorified, 
and the farm made reasonably productive, consti- 
tutes half the idyl; the feminine doctor of philol- 
ogy provides the better half. 

Given a young American girl of good stock and 
rustic training and allow an elderly maiden lady 
of strong will, large means, and excellent social 
position to take her in tow from purely selfish rea- 
sons, and " The Diary of a Beauty " (Lippincott) 
is likely to come out much as Mrs. Molly Elliot 



Seawell records it. Her lovely creature had one 
bad time, but that was when she temporarily lost 
her good looks; the world was at her feet the rest 
of the time, except when she most needed it to be, 
and then it flatly failed her. Beauty, we learn, is 
more highly prized in Europe than in America, 
because of its greater rarity over there. 

As a title, "August First" (Scribner) suggests 
the war; but there is nothing about war in its 
pages, except the war of a soul with itself. It is 
the joint work of Mrs. Mary Raymond Shipman 
Andrews and Mr. Roy Irving Murray, and its chief 
characters are an anglican curate and an unhappy 
rich girl. The latter has nearly every trouble that 
can come with wealth, and the former has the cure 
of her soul through circumstance. A difficult prob- 
lem is permitted to solve itself through details not 
inherent in the problem itself, and it all ends pret- 
tily. The book gives curates another valid reason 
for existing. 

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Handbooks on The new series entitled "The 
the art and Art and Craft of Letters" 
(Doran) promises to be, for the 
most part, authoritative in text, as it is inex- 
pensive and attractive in form. Four little 
volumes have already been issued : ' ' Satire, ' ' 
by Mr. Gilbert Cannan; "History," by Mr. 
R. H. Gretton; "The Epic," by Mr. Lascelles 
Abercrombie; and "Comedy," by Mr. John 
Palmer. Of these the first is the least satisfac- 
tory. Though often happy in its obiter dicta, 
as most critical books are these days, it is too 
offhand, too slight, too vague, and suggests a 
lack of background. Much of it is merely 
celebration of the author of "Erewhon," 
whose service to English life and letters may 
be "not less great than that of Boileau to the 
French." Mr. Abercrombie's study of the 
epic is much better in all respects : it is closely 
reasoned, interesting, and sound. Regarding 
epics "primarily as stages of one continuous 
development," the author discusses the na- 
ture of the epic from the hoary beginnings to 
our own day. He questions "whether it is 
really justifiable or profitable to divide epic 
poetry into the two contrasted departments of 
'authentic' and 'literary.' ' Avoiding rigid 
definition, he indicates the nature of the epic 
by noting that "It must be a story, and the 
story must be told well and greatly; and, 
whether in the story itself or in the telling of 
it, significance must be implied." To the 
process of epic poetry the "Nibelungenlied" 
contributed "plot in narrative"; the "Argo- 
nautica" contributed analytic psychology, 
and love as one of the primary values of life ; 
Virgil, besides heightening old aims and 
effects, contributed the expression of "social 
consciousness" by celebrating the Roman Em- 
pire. "In 'Paradise Lost.' the development 



1915] 



307 



of epic poetry culminates, as far as it has yet 
gone." "'After Milton, it seems likely that 
there is nothing more to be done with objective 
epic. But Hugo's method, of a connected 
sequence of separate poems, instead of one 
continuous poem, may come in here." Mr. 
Palmer's essay on comedy, though less bril- 
liant than Meredith's, has wider vision. He 
makes much of the varying sources of laugh- 
ter. "We laugh," he says, "in different lan- 
guages." The essay by M. Bergson that has 
attained such a vogue is ' ' based almost entirely 
upon the comedies of Moliere." These are 
comedies of "social gesture." They are come- 
dies of "la parfaite raison." But they are 
not of the same type as English comedy. The 
Englishman "is incapable of seeing things 
critically, as a being of simple intelligence, for 
five minutes together. His feelings intrude." 
His is the comedy of humor. Shakespeare's 
"Troilus" and "All's Well" are between the 
two. Falstaff is representative of English 
comedy; "Falstaff is not judged: he is ac- 
cepted. . . . We are asked to become part of 
his folly." "A national English comedy 
might conceivably have grown out of Jonson, 
humanized by Fletcher. But Congreve killed 
the comedy of 'humours' and the pastoral 
comedy of pretty feeling, putting in their 
place something the English have never un- 
derstood and were unable to continue, ' ' the 
comedy of manners. For the present and the 
future, Mr. Palmer would have English comic 
writers put aside purely intellectual comedy 
as alien to their spirit, and, instead, recreate 
the comedy of humor. Let their model "be 
Shakespeare's way with Hermia and Rosalind, 
not Moliere 's way with the 'Precieuses Ridi- 
cules. ' ' This is sound advice, and it is 
needed. 

A capable presentation of the 
The fallacies of view that military force insures 

preparedness. .-!/, i ,-, 

against defeat in war and there- 
fore against having war at all, is contained 
in the volume entitled "Peace Insurance" 
(McClurg), by Mr. Richard Stockton, Jr. Of 
course the writer's fundamental contention is 
that the United States ought to take out more 
insurance of this kind than it has done; 
though he offers no explanation as to why 
Europe, which has long carried very heavy 
insurance of this sort, has now so destructive 
a war upon its hands. The book contends that 
the Army and Navy are not a burden during 
peace, and may if properly managed become 
paying business institutions; that however 
desirable, arbitration, disarmament, or finan- 
cial pressure offer no prospect of relief from 
national rivalries; that the cost of war in 



lives, misery, and money has been exagger- 
ated; that there are many compensations for 
the horrors of war, and that more has been 
gained than lost in many wars; that the sol- 
dier and sailor are often slandered ; that mili- 
tary force is not opposed to the interests of 
the average man ; that our past wars show the 
need for a definite military policy; that the 
recommendations of the General Staff and of 
the Naval Board are reasonable and wise. 
Mr. Stockton deserves praise for the usually 
dispassionate tenor of his work. He shows 
considerable respect for Mr. Norman Angell, 
whom he pronounces "the most practical of 
pacificists." He has less patience with Dr. 
Jordan, whom he considers "a dreamer" who 
is "apparently better acquainted with the 
military possibilities of the various nations 
than are the men who, as professional soldiers, 
make these matters their life study. ' ' Follow- 
ing up this thought of professionalism, Mr. 
Stockton declares it unfortunate that civilian 
bodies (which must mean the President, the 
Secretary of War, and Congress, representing 
the people) should control our military estab- 
lishments. But he is not at all satisfied with 
America's military past. He deplores the 
impression given by our histories that our 
soldiers in past wars have shown superiority 
to the enemy. The unhappy result of this 
teaching is that the nation continues to rely 
upon volunteers, when the facts of war show 
that trained troops alone are equal to modern 
campaigning. Our own past military history, 
says Mr. Stockton, proves this most conspicu- 
ously. "Throughout the entire Revolution, 
the militia continued to run, desert, mutiny, 
and generally imperil the welfare of the Thir- 
teen Colonies." And witness Bull Run, in 
which the volunteer Union army took flight; 
whereas an army of trained troops might have 
crushed its opponents and ended the war. 
That the victorious Confederate army at Bull 
Run also consisted of volunteers seems to 
have escaped the writer's notice. But if Mr. 
Stockton is not satisfied with our military 
past, he is able to secure much comfort and 
moral support for his cause from utterances 
by former Presidents (some of them civilians, 
by the way), especially Washington. This 
dependence upon the past is one of the chief 
points in which those who strive to avert war 
differ from the militarists. The latter see 
only war in the past; the civilist (as the anti- 
militarist chooses to be called) sees a continu- 
ous development of law and order and a 
corresponding objection to war. The militarist 
finds his warrant in what has been ; the civil- 
ist in what ought to be and can be if- man will 
but determine to have it so.

THE DIAL 



[April 15 



Both knowledge and wisdom, 
both book-learning and acquain- 
tance with life, speak in the 
pages of Mr. Horace J. Bridget's ethical and 
philosophic and speculative essays grouped 
under the general title, "Criticisms of Life: 
Studies in Faith, Hope, and Despair" 
(Houghton). Mr. Bridges, English by birth 
and breeding, but now "a candidate for the 
citizenship of this Kepublic," as he declares 
himself, is the leader of the Ethical Society in 
Chicago, and his book is to be taken as an 
earnest endeavor to apply the principles of the 
Ethical Movement to the several problems, 
religious and social and moral, which the vol- 
ume discusses ; or, in his own words, " it is in 
the light of these two principles the princi- 
ple of Idealistic Naturalism and the principle 
of the Supremacy of Ethics that I have re- 
examined the special problems dealt with by 
the writers and thinkers whose works I have 
used as texts." Lest the occurrence of the 
word "despair" in his sub-title should mis- 
lead, the author explains at the outset that in 
adducing illustrations of that state of mind 
"the purpose has been not merely to criticize 
the doctrines rejected, but to justify faith and 
hope by destroying the grounds of their op- 
posites." After this and other preliminary 
remarks the book opens with a study in relig- 
ious experience, with Francis Thompson's 
poem, "The Hound of Heaven," as a text, 
re-enforced by an abundance of apt illustra- 
tion. Then follow a sharp attack on Mr. 
Chesterton as a theologian, a scorching criti- 
cism of Professor Haeckel's philosophy of the 
universe, a calmly rational consideration of 
Sir Oliver Lodge's famous Presidential Ad- 
dress, of two years ago, before the British 
Association for the Advancement of Science, 
a critical review of "The Inside of the Cup," | 
a strong protest against the "new morality" 
advocated in the writings of Miss Ellen Key 
and Mr. Bernard Shaw, an arraignment of 
M. Maeterlinck and Colonel Ingersoll for \ 
daring to maintain the justifiability of sui- 
cide in certain circumstances, a panegyric on 
Captain Scott, and a brief epilogue on the 
European war. Notable amid other pro- ; 
nounced features of the book is the author's | 
disapproval of Mr. Chesterton as an argumen- 
tative writer; he is "the supreme genius of 
inaccuracy," as we are assured more than 
once, in varying terms, both in the chapter 
devoted to him and elsewhere. But, by a sort 
of nemesis familiar to those who have studied 
the habits of that two-edged sword called criti- 
cism, the critic himself falls into the trap of 
inaccuracy and exaggeration in the very act 
of accusing the other of those failings. For 



instance, he speaks of Mr. Chesterton's aston- 
ishing and not always admirable productivity 
thus : ' ' We find him every week in the ' Illus- 
trated London News' and the London 'Daily 
Herald' . . . and almost every month in al- 
most every magazine" which is obviously 
untrue as well as impossible even in the case 
of that inexhaustible genius. In general, how- 
ever, Mr. Bridges is temperate as well as 
agreeably readable; his sanity and sweet rea- 
sonableness are qualities of which we cannot 
have too much in these days; and it is to be 
hoped his book will have the wide reading it so 
richly deserves. 

Disraeli durin g The revival of interest in the 
the decade problems ot the British Lmpire, 

which came in the last quarter of 
the nineteenth century and which has been 
especially prominent in English politics since 
the great struggle with the Boers, has natu- 
rally turned the thoughts of Englishmen back 
to the statesman who more than any other 
Prime Minister strove to enlarge the domin- 
ions of England over the seas. It was found 
to the regret of many that no adequate biog- 
raphy had been written of Benjamin Disraeli, 
that no author had ever attempted to trace the 
development of the seemingly contradictory 
principles of his political philosophy. A few 
years ago Mr. Murray, the English publisher, 
undertook to bring out such a work, the writ- 
ing of which was to be done by Mr. W. F. 
Monypenny, a young journalist who had 
achieved great distinction in his profession. 
Two volumes appeared in due time, carrying 
the narrative down to 1846. "When Mr. 
Monypenny was completing for the press the 
second volume of this biography his health 
was rapidly failing, and he died ten days after 
its publication." Mr. George Earle Buckle, 
at one time editor of the London "Times," 
assisted the author in putting his last volume 
through the press, and to him the publishers 
have assigned the task of completing the biog- 
raphy. Volume III., which has recently ap- 
peared, is therefore almost entirely Mr. 
Buckle 's work ; Mr. Monypenny had collected 
and sifted a large amount of materials, but he 
left only one chapter completely written an 
analysis of Disraeli's novel "Tancred." Mr. 
Buckle has followed faithfully the plan origi- 
nally adopted; to a large extent the docu- 
ments, as in the earlier volumes, are allowed to 
tell their own story; but on the whole, Mr. 
Buckle maintains a better proportion between 
documents and narrative. Like his predeces- 
sor, he writes from a Tory viewpoint. The 
new volume covers the period from 1846 to 
1855, the period of Disraeli's rise to leadership 



1915

among the protectionist Tories and of his suc- 
cessful effort to reshape Toryism along 
broader conservative lines. The most notable 
feature of Mr. Buckle's study, aside from a 
detailed history of protectionism in its de- 
cline, is his defence of Disraeli against the 
charge that he was insincere when he came 
forward as the champion of the corn laws. 
The author believes that he was thoroughly 
honest in his support of the agrarian interests, 
but that he regarded protection as an expe- 
dient, not a principle, and that he abandoned 
it because he realized that England was done 
with corn laws. Lord Derby, who was Dis- 
raeli's chief, is treated with some severity; 
Mr. Buckle finds him lacking in foresight and 
especially in political courage. The volume 
contains some discussion of personal matters, 
but on the whole it is chiefly a history of Dis- 
raeli's activities in parliament and of English 
politics generally during the period under re- 
view. The original plan was to complete the 
biography in three volumes; three have now 
appeared, and Disraeli has scarcely been 
launched upon his great career. Unless some 
different plan is adopted for the remainder of 
the work, we may look for at least three vol- 
umes more. (Macmillan.) 



In his book entitled "Wild Life 
ofwiidii?e tion Conservation in Theory and 

Practice" (Yale University 
Press) Dr. William T. Hornaday has brought 
together the substance of a series of lectures 
delivered in 1914 before the Forest School of 
Yale University. Mr. Frederic C. Walcott has 
added a chapter on private game preserves as 
factors in conservation, and a useful bibliog- 
raphy of the more recent works on wild birds 
with special reference to game preserves and 
the protection and propagation of game. Dr. 
Hornaday, in his noble fight on behalf of the 
wild life of America, has realized the impor- 
tance of awakening the interest of the univer- 
sities. ' ' What is needed, ' ' he says, ' ' and now 
demanded of professors and teachers in all our 
universities, colleges, normal schools, and high 
schools, is vigorous and persistent teaching of 
the ways and means that can successfully be 
employed in the wholesale manufacture of 
public sentiment in behalf of the rational and 
effective protection of wild life." In empha- 
sizing the vital importance of conservation, 
from an economic even more than from a 
sentimental standpoint, Dr. Hornaday offers 
encouragement to further effort by setting 
forth what has already been accomplished by 
a comparatively small body of earnest-minded 
men and women. This work may be summar- 
ized as follows: (1) seventy per cent of the 



killing of non-game-birds has been stopped; 
(2) the killing of game has been restricted to 
open seasons, which have steadily been made 
shorter; (3) long close seasons, usually for 
five years, have been extended to a very few 
species threatened with local extinction; (4) 
the sale of game has been prohibited in seven- 
teen states ; (5) the importation of wild birds' 
plumage for millinery and the use of native 
birds as hat ornaments have been completely 
suppressed; (6) the creation of a large num- 
ber of national and state game-preserves and 
bird refuges has been brought about; (7) a 
partial suppression of the use of extra-deadly 
firearms in killing birds has been effected ; (8) 
the enactment of a law placing all our 610 
species of migratory birds under the protec- 
tion of the federal government has been se- 
cured. Dr. Hornaday 's book should do much 
to widen and deepen the interest in the protec- 
tion of our wild life, and particularly the 
saving from imminent extermination of sev- 
eral important species. 



Confessions 
of Frederick 
the Great. 



A timely publication is Messrs. 
Putnam's reprint 0f "The 
Confessions of Frederick the 
Great," edited by Mr. Douglas Sladen, with 
a "Foreword" by Mr. George Haven Put- 
nam, and a translation of Treitschke's "Life 
of Frederick the Great" appended. If to- 
day's interpretation of the "Confessions" is 
different from that which historical criticism 
would have accorded it a year ago, this dif- 
ference shows how even criticism must bear 
its burdens in the face of upsetting facts. 
Mr. Sladen explains that Carlyle's "million 
words" are too many for the curious of these 
days : a smaller book about Frederick has its 
place. The text of the "Confessions" 5s 
taken from an eighteenth century translation, 
and one regrets that Mr. Sladen did not tell 
us about the text of Frederick's original, 
whether it is included in the Berlin edition of 
his works, and what those editors said of it. 
No one can hope to write of Frederick with 
authority who has not made himself familiar 
with that remarkable set of books. That Mr. 
Sladen is not ignorant of the collected edition 
is evident in his criticism of Treitschke's 
praise of Frederick's " Anti-Machiavell, " as 
indicating views long held by Frederick, pre- 
sumably after he came to the throne. Mr. 
Sladen might have added that the "Anti- 
Machiavell" was written before the invasion 
of Silesia gave the lie to all that was genu- 
inely noble in the earlier writings of the 
Crown Prince. It would be unfair to satisfy 
curiosity by quoting from the "Confessions"; 
they are worth reading, and one may duti-

fully record a sense of loathing at the doc- 
trines they reveal. Mr. Putnam's "Fore- 
word" prepares the reader for the political 
purpose of the ' ' Life of Frederick the Great ' ' 
by Treitschke. This is the work of what one 
may call the Historian-Laureate of the 
Hohenzollerns. It is small wonder, after the 
testimony of such foreigners as Macaulay and 
Carlyle, that a scholar of the Court should 
try to outdo the hero-worship of Frederick. 
But nothing in Treitschke reaches the level 
of Macaulay 's paragraph describing Freder- 
ick's unification of the Germans. One may 
indeed acquit the Germans of having origi- 
nated the Prussian epic : the stuff of Prus- 
sian history was first made eloquent for all 
time by these masters of English prose. And 
it is significant that no complete collection of 
Frederick's writings was made until some 
years after the appearance of Macaulay 's 
brilliant essay. 

Lesser-knovn Mr Theodore P. Shonts SOWed, 

builders of the and Colonel George W. Goethals 
^ reaped; the Second Isthmian 
Commission labored, and the Third Isthmian 
Commission entered into its labors. Such, in 
brief, is the burden of Mr. W. Leon Pepper- 
man's argument in "Who Built the Panama 
Canal?" (Button), the story of the big ditch 
as told by the Chief of Office of Administration 
of the Second Isthmian Canal Commission. 
Naturally enough the hero of the Panama 
Canal is, to most of us, he who carried the 
great engineering enterprise to a triumphant 
termination; and almost without exception 
the published accounts of that undertaking 
ascribe the glory to the present Governor of 
the Canal Zone, whom in this season of na- 
tional rejoicing over the completion of the 
mammoth task all are eager to honor with the 
recognition he unquestionably deserves. Hence 
there is room, and to spare, in the book-world 
for a volume calling attention to the man who, 
as one of the engineers expressed it in speak- 
ing of Mr. Shonts and those under him, ' ' built 
the machine and started it going, and then 
gave the handle to Goethals, who turned the 
crank and ground out the results. ' ' Mr. John 
F. Stevens, Chief Engineer under Mr. Shonts, 
is also duly honored in Mr. Pepperman's 
pages, and, still further to discharge a 
neglected duty, the abortive efforts of the 
French to cut the western continent in two 
are made to appear of vast though commonly 
unrecognized importance. In fact, the author 
contends that "the three controlling factors in 
the final construction of the waterway across 
the Isthmus of Panama were the French, Theo- 
dore Roosevelt, and the railroad men," the 



chief of the last-named being, of course, Mr. 
Shonts. Noteworthy on its artistic side are 
the book's reproductions of Mr. Joseph Pen- 
nell's deservedly famous pictures of Panama 
Canal scenes. To these are added good por- 
traits of the chief architects of the great work. 
Mr. Pepperman's book was needed to help 
round out the story of the big canal. 

There is a lilt and rush of mel- 

Mr. Markham'a . 

latest volume ody in much 01 the recent verse 
of Mr. Edwin Markham, now 
collected under the title of "The Shoes of 
Happiness, and Other Poems" (Doubleday), 
which make the worm-eaten lines of the 
"new" poets seem shabby by contrast. Wit- 
ness this from ' ' Virgilia" : 
" What was I back in the world's first wonder? 

An elf -child found on an ocean reef, 
A sea-child nursed by the surge and thunder 

And marked for the lyric grief." 

Or this from its sequel, "The Crowning 

Hour": 

" We are caught in the coil of a God's romances 

We come from old worlds and we go afar : 
I have missed you again in the Earth's wild 

chances 
Now to another star ! " 

The poet is represented in various moods. 
Best of the narrative verse is "The Juggler of 
Touraine," the juggler being described as a 
jolly punchinello trotting out on tipsy stilts 
from a strange old medieval legend of the 
Madonna. The title poem is rich in imagery ; 
it is otherwise adequate in the main, but it 
leaves the suggestion that the search for the 
blue flower, the blue bird, the shoes of the 
shoeless beggar, or whatever the symbol, is 
not the theme, for Mr. Markham at least, that 
will most nobly "shake the soul and let the 
glory out." Nor do the songs of war and 
peace, of social vision, of religion, strike depths 
as unerringly as do those of love and youth. 
Of unusual distinction is "Villon: He Still 
Complaineth of His Piteous Plight, ' ' for there 
is more than the cynic's philosophy about the 
vagaries of fortune in the recurring last line 
of each stanza of the poem, which begins as 
follows : 

" Here am I now in a piteous plight, 

Doused and dour in a hell, you see; 
For I slipt and fell in the mortal fight ; 

I was one, but the fates were three ! " 

A pity it is that those who would

and fair-minded reading of Dr. 
Joseph H. Crocker's book, "Shall I Drink?"

and other competent authority, against the 
use of alcoholic liquors are so obvious as well 
as unanswerable that the only wonder is they 
should have to be stated at all. But it has 
long been a self-evident truth that men are 
governed, not by their reason, but by their 
feelings; and hence it is that all the world 
does not eagerly accept and profit by such 
convincing demonstrations of its folly as this 
from Dr. Crooker. Without fanaticism he 
urges the desirability, from almost every 
point of view, of having nothing to do with 
alcoholic drinks, marshalling his facts and 
figures and other instruments of persuasion, 
or dissuasion, in ten well-considered chapters, 
beginning with the ancient origin of what he 
calls "the drink superstition," proceeding 
with a calm examination of all that can be 
said in favor of a more or less restricted indul- 
gence in intoxicants, exposing the failure of 
even the famous Gothenburg system and show- 
ing that "liquor selling and liquor drinking 
can no more be made harmless than gambling 
and leprosy, ' ' and concluding with an encour- 
aging survey of present "signs of promise." 
Sixteen copyrighted charts of the Scientific 
Temperance Federation are inserted by per- 
mission as a graphic aid to the enforcement of 
the argument against drink. 



Tke most ^ su ^ject of natural history 

interesting of offers a more fascinating field 
for study than the life-history 
of the American beaver. The beaver has 
probably been the subject of more pure fiction 
than any other known animal; yet when one 
has read such a book as Mr. A. Radclyff e Dug- 
more 's "Romance of the Beaver" (Lippin- 
cott), in which every statement is supported 
by indisputable evidence, generally the result 
of the author's own painstaking observations, 
one is left with the feeling that the true life 
of the beaver is quite as wonderful as the 
fictitious exploits with which the industrious 
little animal is credited in some of our early 
narratives. Mr. Dugmore makes no more am- 
bitious claim for his book than that he has 
tried to keep the subject free from exaggera- 
tion and technicalities. He has done that, and 
a good deal more. He has brought together 
an extraordinary mass of material relating to 
the life, habits, and wonderful engineering 
feats of the beaver ; he has presented this ma- 
terial in a most attractive and convincing way, 
and he has illustrated every point with a 
photograph or an original drawing. Inci- 
dentally he makes a strong plea for the pro- 
tection of ' ' the most interesting animal to-day 
extant." The book makes a welcome addition 
to the scanty literature on the beaver. 



NOTES. 



" The Socialist and the War," by Mr. William 
English Walling, is a volume announced for April 
issue by Messrs. Holt. 

Two novels scheduled for publication this month 
by Messrs. Putnam are Miss Ethel M. Dell's " The 
Keeper of the Door " and Miss Leslie Moore's " The 
Jester." 

Mr. Ernest Rhys has prepared a biographical 
sketch of Rabindranath Tagore, his ideals, achieve- 
ments, and ambitions, which Messrs. Macmillan will 
publish. 

Baron de Kusel (Bey), formerly controller gen- 
eral of Egyptian customs, has written a volume of 
reminiscences which will be issued by Messrs. John 
Lane Co. 

A book on " Methods and Aims in the Study of 
Literature," by Professor Lane Cooper of Cornell 
University, is soon to appear with Messrs. Ginn & 
Co.'s imprint. 

" The Little Man, and Other Satires," studies of 
various phases and types of modern society by 
Mr. John Galsworthy, is promised for early issue 
by Messrs. Scribner. 

M. Pierre Berger's study of "William Blake: 
His Mysticism and Poetry," which has attracted 
much attention in France, is soon to appear in an 
English translation made by Mr. D. H. Conner. 

In his forthcoming volume on "Arms and the 
Race," Professor R. M. Johnston shows the diffi- 
culties in the way of disarmament and considers, 
as a matter of history, the effect of war upon 
nations. 

The first book dealing with the author of 
" Erewhon " is soon to appear in Mr. Gilbert Can- 
nan's "Samuel Butler: A Critical Study." It 
would be edifying to have Butler's own comments 
on this enterprise. 

A new volume of Mr. L. P. Jacks's stimulating 
essays is soon to be published under the title, 
" Urgent Themes." Mr. Jacks is editor of " The 
Hibbert Journal," and the author of several pre- 
viously published books. 

During the month Colonel S. B. Steele's " Forty 
Years in Canada," the record of a frontiersman and 
soldier, will be issued by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 
The Rt. Hon. Lord Strathcona has written an intro- 
duction for the volume. 

Mr. A. C. Benson's memoir of his brother, Mon- 
signor Benson, soon to be published under the title 
" Hugh," is not intended as a formal and finished 
biography. It was only written " to fix scenes 
and memories before they suffered from any dim 
obliteration of time." 

Mrs. Hugh Fraser, whose several volumes of 
" Reminiscences of a Diplomatist's Wife " have 
been widely read and enjoyed, will give us some 
additional chapters of autobiography in a book 
entitled " Seven Years on the Pacific Slope," to 
appear during the spring. 

The first volumes to appear in the " New Poetry 
Series," announced by the Houghton Mifflin Co., 
are the following : " Irradiations," by Mr. John 



THE DIAL 



[April 15- 



Gould Fletcher; "Japanese Lyrics," by Lafcadio 
Hearn ; " The Winnowing Fan," by Mr. Lawrence 
Binyon ; and an anthology, "Some Imagiste Poets." 
An autobiographical " Revery on My Childhood 
and Youth," by Mr. W. B. Yeats, is likely to prove 
one of the most interesting publications of the 
season. The volume will bear the imprint of the 
Cuala Press of Dublin. We note also the announce- 
ment of an impending critical study of Mr. Yeats, 
from the pen of Mr. Forrest Reid. 

Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine is preparing to com- 
pile a collection of Mark Twain's letters, which 
Messrs. Harper will publish. In his recent biog- 
raphy he was forced to restrict the inclusion of any 
correspondence of Twain to such letters as illumi- 
nated the text, but now his aim is to print all the 
available correspondence which will come into his 
hands. 

Professor Gilbert Murray's " The Stoic Philoso- 
phy," to be published this month, is the sixth of the 
memorial lectures founded in memory of Moncure 
D. Conway, and delivered annually at South Place 
Institute. The five preceding lecturers were Mr. 
J. M. Robertson, Mr. Norman Angell, Mr. H. W. 
Nevinson, Mr. William Archer, and Mr. John 
Russell. 

Still another series (the third) of monographs 
on prominent writers of the day is announced by a 
London publisher. It will bear the general title, 
" Studies of Living Authors," and in the first three 
volumes to appear Mr. H. G. Wells will be dealt 
with by Mr. R. W. Talbot Cox, Mr. Arnold Bennett 
by Professor J. R. Skemp, and M. Anatole France 
by Mr. Geoffrey Cookson. The books will be full- 
length studies, rather than brief outlines. 

A ten-volume translation of the most important 
works of Martin Luther, from the Ninety-five The- 
ses of 1517 until his death, is announced by Messrs. 
A. J. Holman Co., of Philadelphia. Each volume 
will be provided with an introduction and explana- 
tory notes. The translation has been done by schol- 
ars who have devoted the past five years to a study 
of Luther's treatises, and the work aims to reveal 
the reformer in all his many-sided activity. The 
first volume of the set wili appear this month. 

Indiana librarians, as is announced in the " Li- 
brary Occurrent" of the Public Library Commis- 
sion of Indiana, are advocating the passage, by 
their State legislature, of a librarians' licensing 
bill authorizing the appointment, by the Commis- 
sion, of a board of library examiners " whose duty 
it shall be to establish grades, hold examinations, 
and accredit library schools." The examiners are 
to be four in number and to serve, after the system 
is well started, four years each, without pay, and 
with one vacancy to fill every year. 

For the volume entitled " Bronte Poems : Selec- 
tions from the Poetry of Charlotte, Emily, Anne, 
and Branwell Bronte, including Some Poems Hith- 
erto Unprinted," which is now nearly ready for 
publication, the editor, Mr. A. C. Benson, has laid 
under contribution all the poems hitherto printed. 
The object has been to make accessible for the first 
time in one volume all the best poetical work of the 
Bronte familv. Each of the sisters is included in 



the pieces now first published. Reproductions of 
the recently discovered portraits of the sisters and 
facsimile MSS. are also included. 

The "Reminiscences and Letters of Sir Robert 
Ball," edited by his son, Mr. W. Valentine Ball,, 
will appear at once in England. The reminiscences 
were begun by Sir Robert Ball some years before 
his death toward the end of 1913, but failing health 
prevented him from completing the work. In 
revising and editing the material at his father's 
request, Mr. Ball has interwoven letters to and 
from many distinguished correspondents, and added 
the personal recollections, among others, of hia 
uncle, Sir Charles Ball, and Sir Joseph Larmor; 
while Professor E. T. Whittaker has contributed 
an appendix dealing with Sir Robert's mathe- 
matical work. 

One of our most noted English scholars, Profes- 
sor Thomas R. Lounsbury of Yale, died April 9 at 
New Haven. Born at Ovid, N. Y., January 1, 1838 r 
he was graduated in 1859 from the college to which 
he gave the best of his energies and talents for 
nearly the rest of his life. Literary work of a hum- 
ble sort occupied the two years following his gradu- 
ation ; then came three years of military service in 
the Civil War; five years after its close he became 
instructor in English at the Sheffield Scientific 
School of Yale University, and from 1871 we find 
him holding a professorship of the English Lan- 
guage and Literature. He was librarian of the 
Sheffield Scientific School from 1873 to 1906, and 
had been Professor Emeritus after the latter date. 
His membership in the American Academy of Arts 
and Letters, and in other learned societies, bore 
witness to his scholarship and repute. Apart from 
his well-known Chaucerian and Shakespearean and 
linguistic writings, which hardly need to be enumer- 
ated here, he made not many contributions to litera- 
ture, but will be remembered for his biography of 
James Fenimore Cooper in the "American Men of 
Letters " series ; and not very long before he died 
he published some lectures on " The Early Literary 
Career of Robert Browning." He had also edited 
the complete works of Charles Dudley Warner, with 
biographical introduction. Vigor and independence 
distinguished his work as a writer even to the 
point of espousing the spelling-reform heresy.

Will be issued April 17

The New Republic is different from the usual

The Supplement will open with an editorial 
survey of the more fundamental tendencies of 
the Spring season. Each group of books war, 
fiction, economics will then be treated gener- 
ally by a competent authority with individual ref- 
erence to the more vital books in each field. Spe- 
ial critiques will follow on such distinguished 
contemporary authors as Theodore Dreiser, 
Joseph Conrad, Hugh Walpole, Arthur Bullard, 
James Stephens, Frank Harris. Space usually 
given to a bewildering maze of perfunctory re- 
views will be devoted to a classified list of recom- 
mended books and special articles by Francis 
Hackett, Philip Littell and Walter Lippmann.

What "Every Column Clean" 
Means in 

Detroit Saturday Night 

IT is the approved standard of journalism 
that maintains the same supervision over 
the advertising columns as is maintained 
over the editorial columns. It is the stand- 
ard which makes it possible for the publisher 
to guarantee every representation of the 
advertiser. Consequently the reader of such 
a journal has a degree of confidence in the 
advertising columns which does not prevail 
in the publication which permits the adver- 
tiser to mislead and defraud its readers. 
This should be a standard invaluable to the 
book publisher and the book advertiser. 
Detroit Saturday Night has the confidence 
of the book readers of Detroit and Michigan . 
Its readers will buy the books that are adver- 
tised in this publication's columns because 
they have confidence in Detroit Saturday 
Night's judgment in the acceptance of 
advertisements. That is the sort of publi- 
cation you ought to make your announce- 
ments in, Mr. Publisher.

Philadelphia Record: "There are thrills in the story that surpass any that 
fictionists can create, and it is a tribute to strong men who went forth to meet perils 
and even death itself that the world might know something of the long unknown 
and almost forbidden land. " 

London Saturday Review: "One of the world's greatest stories of adventure; 
there is not a moment's doubt about this." 

Of the Work Accomplished 
Boston Transcript: " A treasure house of facts. " 

London Athenaeum: " No Polar book ever written has surpassed these volumes 
either in sustained interest or in the variety of the subject-matter." 

Of the Illustrations 

A. Radclyffe Dugmore, the Noted Camera Naturalist, says. "It would 
indeed be difficult to imagine any more perfect. I have never seen any that sur- 
pass them, both in beauty and interest."

HOW BELGIUM SAVED EUROPE 

By Dr. CHARLES SAROLEA, the Eminent Belgian Scholar 

A thrilling, moving chronicle, as intensely interesting as the greatest fiction. 
An epic tale of Belgium's heroic defense against great odds by one who was there. 
It explains many things that you can not learn from newspaper or magazine ac- 
counts. Dr. Sarolea is unbiased, and presents the facts in a new light. $1.00 net. 
James L. Ford, in the New York Hera Id." The literature of the war is more 
remarkable for quantity than quality. One book, however, deserves serious atten- 
tion, and that is 'How Belgium Saved Europe.' . . . It is a long time since 
I have read a book that sets forth so briefly and convincingly the story of the part 
played by this gallant little kingdom as the saviour of Europe if not of our own 
country."

"Better than Queed 



ANGELA'S BUSINESS 

By Henry Sydnor Harrison 




New York Times 

" Mr. Harrison has written with 
serious intent a novel far-reaching in its 
issues and full of thought; but, to the 
joy of his readers, he can no more help 
seeing the humorous side of things and 
writing with a twinkle in his eye than 
he can help breathing. One with 
Bernard Shaw as to the pursuing 
female, he portrays to the life her 
engaging wiles, and gives mirth-pro- 
voking pictures of her methods of 
capture, of which that triumphal car, 
the 'Fordette,' is chief. . . . The 
strongest and most satisfying of Mr. 
Harrison's remarkable trio of novels." 



New York Tribune 

"It is a delightful book, as thor- 
oughly enjoyable as its two predecessors 
(' Queed' and 'V. V. 's Eyes'), as full 
of human kindliness as they, but of far 
deeper understanding of the prelude to 
life. . . . The best of the three 
Mr. Harrison has written thus far." 

New York Globe 

" The first feminist novel of any 
importance written in America. . 

Aside from being an interesting and 
sane contribution to the woman ques- 
tion, it is a delightful love story, the 
kind we all like." 

Boston Herald 

"The most genial and philosophic 
of the notable trio Mr. Harrison has 
produced." 



The Outlook 

"No question ever presented for 
solution has needed the sanity and 
saving grace of humor more than the 
suffrage, and few discussions have so 
generally missed it. 'Angela's Busi- 
ness' barely touches suffrage, but what 
is crudely called the ' woman question ' 
is fundamentally involved in the story. 
'Angela's Business' is a 
wholesome story for those men who 
understand neither women nor the 
immense extension of women's activi- 
ties in the modern world. It is a whole- 
some story also for those who belong to 
the 'lunatic fringe of reform,' the 
extreme feminists and the radical 
disciples of the Newness. . . . It 
is sane, normal, wholesome, light in 
manner but serious in temper, lacking 
neither wisdom, wit nor humor. It 
shows a great advance in simplicity and 
soundness of style over 'V. V.'s Eyes. ' "

BRUNEL'S TOWER 



By EDEN PHILLPOTTS 



The Boston Transcript says of "Brunei's Tower:" 

"Through alternations of every aspect of life the story of BRUNEL'S TOWER pro- 
gresses. It touches lightly upon love, upon the pathos of old age, upon the 
workman's passion for his work, upon the artist's worship of his art, upon 
an infinite variety of human ways and moods, and it is filled to its 

depths with reflections upon life that arc very near to life itself.

"Of exceptional in- \^ searched their souls, and that he shows us their 
terest, both for its N. innermost selves as well as their physical be- 
racy character drawing \ in S" -. It is Mr. Phillpotts at his 

characteristic best." 



and its ingenious web of 
incident. . . . Here is the old 
intimate style vividly illumi- 
nating with humor and human- 
ity, the ordinary affairs of daily 
life. The folk whose lives are 
mirrored in its pages have the 
vitality and reality which dis- 
tinguish the work of Mr. Phill- 
potts at his best. . . . Told 
easily and naturally, yet with 
genuine art." 



The New York Herald says: 

" Mr. Phillpotts's new novel 
is both readable and instruc- 
tive. ... An interesting 
work with a vast amount 
of information. 
BRUNEL'S 
TOWER 
is genuinely 
pleasing." 



Brunei's Tower 

is magnificently written, . . . 
The daily bread of life is in this 
book. . . . Absorbingly interest- 
ing, and holds that element 
of surprise which is never lack- 
ing in the work of the true story

be frankly grateful, for it holds

ment." NEW YORK TIMES. 



Mr. Phillpotts 
has written no 
story of finer fiber than 
BRUNEL'S TOWER." 



The New York Globe says: 

" In the prime of his life, 
Eden Phillpotts is doing the 
best work of his career. . . . 
Mr. Phillpotts has written 
more thrilling stories than 
BRUNEL'S TOWER, but 
none more artistic, appealing, 
and true. . . . Decidedly a 
novel worth reading." 



Philadelphia 
North- American says: 

'A novel that is varied in 

The New Republic says: \ incident and color, and 

"Are you by any chance looking for a text \ has . ^ brightness and

Phillpotts's controlling imagination has given the one tone, the 
one color he wanted it to have. . . . BRUNEL'S TOWER is a 
record of fine pleasure in fine things, a novel quite admirable in com- 
position, and written with distinction and charm." 

The Springfield Republican says: 

'One of those more serious studies of character at which Phillpotts is in reality one. of tlfe 
masters of the time though his work, certainly in this country, is too little appreciated. . . 
BRUNEL'S TOWER must be placed among the better of the many novels he has written."

A COMMODITY OF GOOD NAMES. 



Language is all names. Nouns, of course, 
are the names of persons or things ; adjectives 
and adverbs are the names of qualities ; verbs 
the names of actions. If you say " John ran a 
mile briskly " you are simply naming first the 
person, second the kind of action he indulged 
in, third the division of space he covered, and 
fourth the way in which he did it. Pronouns 
are simply signs substituted for names to obvi- 
ate their repetition. Thus we say: "John 
went to his house " instead of " John went to 
John's house." The articles, conjunctions, and 
prepositions are more abstract, but they are 
merely a thin cement to hold together the 
name-bricks of language. 

To name is the poet's trade ; but collective 
humanity has been at work at it from the be- 
ginning, naming and re-naming, forming airy 
symbols for the realities of the world. All the 
languages and dialects are its attempts at 
piecing together images so they can be passed 
from mind to mind. And the vast web so 
fabricated is ready to the hand of the still 
more definitely purposed poet or prose writer 
to cut up into garments for the creations of his 
imagination. Language is the exercise of the 
world before it becomes the skill of one or a 
score or a hundred ; just as myriads of minute 
insects contribute to the building of a coral 
reef before palms and cocoanut trees can wave 
their fronds above the sea. 

As far as permanency is concerned, the 
anonymous haphazard naming of the multi- 
tude may outlast most of the labored work of 
the poet. It does not write on paper or parch- 
ment, but on the face of the earth on places, 
houses, waters, woods. A good percentage of 
territorial names must have been originally 
the work of fancy; they were appellations 
which had a meaning of honor, irony, con- 
tempt. In a desert island story, when the ship- 
wrecked people have mapped out their domain, 
they proceed to give names to the various 
places, such as Cape Fear, Bay of Good Hope, 
Snug Harbor, and so forth. This has probably 
been the method of the world in general. The 
nomenclature reflects the mood of the discov- 
erers, as in Bret Harte's country with its Dead 



326 



THE DIAL 



[ April 29 



Man's Gulch and Roaring Camp and the like. 
In earlier days the territorial appellations be- 
came the names of the persons who dwelt in 
such places ; so people were called Ford, Field, 
Wood, and innumerable other name words. In 
fact, though that collective poet, the world, is 
continually at work at language or naming, its 
efforts in personal nomenclature display a cer- 
tain poverty of invention. There are said to 
be only three names to-day in Wales, which 
we suppose are Jones, Lloyd, and Llewellyn. 
China has proportionally even fewer sur- 
names ; and most modern races betray the same 
narrowing of this kind of nomenclature, as 
though humanity had grown weary of mark- 
ing out its innumerable children. 

One of the ways in which humanity has par- 
ticularly exercised its naming faculty is in the 
designations given to homes, and more espe- 
cially inns. The inn names throughout En- 
gland are a delight to the student of the 
grotesque, the bizarre, the unexpected. A list 
ought to be compiled of them as a work of 
national humor. Excluding the various 
"Arms" and "King's Heads" and "Saracen 
Heads," there are a multitude of inn signs 
ranging from the quaint to the inexplicably 
queer. Pretty nearly all the animals, existent 
or imaginary, have lent their names and 
painted semblances to these signs. There is 
or was " The Mermaid," " The Griffin," " The 
Elephant," " The White Hart," " The Boar's 
Head," "The Three Cranes in the Vintry." 
There are a great many trios, " The Three 
Angels," "The Three Tuns," "The Three 
Nuns," "The Three Cups," and so forth. 
" The Goose and the Gridiron " is understand- 
able; and "The Bull and the Gate" is sup- 
posed to be a corruption of Boulogne Gate. 
But what does " The Salutation and the Cat " 
mean, or the "The Cock and the Bottle"? 
Our American inns have rarely such pictur- 
esque names as the English, though we know 
of one in Jersey called " The Blazing Rag." 

Speaking of the supposed monotony of no- 
menclature in Wales to-day, we are reminded 
of Matthew Arnold's remarks about the lofty 
and penetrating beauty of the ancient Welsh 
and Cornish names, Tintagel, Caernarvon, 
and others. We used to think that there was 
something of this "large utterance" in the 
American Indian names; Pocahontas, Pow- 
hatan, Manhattan, Mohawk, Pawnee, have a 
high order of style about them. But too many 
Indian names are composed of grunts and gut- 



turals. There is a place in Pennsylvania called 
Wapwallopen ; translated, this means War- 
rior's Rest, which is pretty enough. Then there 
are Mauch Chunk, Manuka Chunk, Tamenend, 
Wissahickon none of which would seem to 
be conceived in the style of great poetry. 

It is a sign of genius when a writer is as 
much concerned in the selection of his names 
as in the ordering of other words. Just what 
makes the names appropriate or beautiful 
would be difficult to say. Euphony counts for 
much, association for much. But after all, it 
is more or less of a mystery why Pembroke 
should be a beautiful name and Hodgins an 
ugly one; why Beatrice should be noble and 
graceful, and Sophronisba a trifle ridiculous. 
The taste of the best judges decides, and the 
world comes around to their opinion. There 
are three great divisions of names in fiction, 
and the appropriate and beautiful form the 
first. These, perhaps, give a writer the least 
trouble. He has simply to select from the 
large stock which use has approved. How 
much of the effect of Horace's Odes is due to 
the lovely Greek and Latin female names 
which they enshrine! We must brighten up 
our page with some of them, Lydia, Lalage, 
Myrtale, Phryne, Glycera, Terentia, Cynara, 
Chloe, Pyrrha, Leuconoe, Tyndaris, Barine, 
Asteria. Such names have the perfection of 
the classic world. They sound like fountains 
rippling over marble; they gleam like moon- 
light in old gardens. The names of Shake- 
speare's girls are far more richly colored, are 
wilder, more full of romance. Rosalind, Juliet, 
Viola, Miranda, Perdita, Portia, Beatrice, 
Imogen, these are double roses compared 
with the Latin poet's simpler flowers. Shake- 
speare was equally fortunate in his men's 
names. In his historic plays he came into the 
inheritance of the Norman-English nomencla- 
ture, than which there has never been anything 
more impressive. In his other plays an almost 
infallible taste guided him in his selection of 
names. Sometimes, indeed, we think he picked 
out stories for the sake of the names. His first 
child, born before he left Stratford, was named 
Hamnet. Was he already brooding over the 
Danish Prince, or did he choose that subject 
because of his son? Scott, also, came into a 
commodity of good names: Waverley (who 
almost gave his name to an epoch), Redgaunt- 
let, Montrose, Douglas, Marmion. Surely 
names were more splendid in those old days 
! than now, they were like banners flung upon 



1915]

the air. The old lady who thrilled at the 
sound of the blessed name Mesopotamia was 
certainly not alone in her love for lofty appel- 
lations. And when names are concatenated in 
poetry, as they are in passages of Milton, Mar- 
lowe, Scott, they can move most readers still 
by their inspiring harmony. To the English 
lyric poets, names are almost the captain jew- 
els in their carcanets of words. Lovelace, 
Burns, Shelley, Tennyson, all lift up single 
names until they glow like stars. Lander's 
immortality is perhaps best assured by the 
eight lines which exhale the fragrance of that 
perfect name, Rose Aylmer. 

The second division of fiction names is that 
of the perfectly characteristic; and here the 
writer has to labor terribly. We are told how 
Balzac used to ride around Paris studying the 
shop signs, in search of a name for some char- 
acter he had in mind. Dickens turned and 
twisted his names, until by some subtle instinct 
he recognized that he had the right one. When 
this did arrive it was a stroke of genius; it 
was half the battle. It was like adding the 
necessary chemical to a solution, the char- 
acter was the precipitate. Would it be possi- 
ble to imagine Sairey Gamp, Dick Swiveller, 
the Wellers, Micawber, or Pecksniff under 
other names? It is hardly necessary to read 
the novels to have some idea of these person- 
ages. At their very best, such names become 
proverbial. Don Quixote's name has been 
made into a noun and an adjective. Shandy- 
ism is the label of a certain quality of humor. 
The Pickwickian sense excuses everything. 
Here, again, the reason for the fitness of the 
cognomen is a mystery. Why should Quilp be 
the pre-ordained name for Dickens's funniest 
fiend? Why should "My Uncle Toby" ex- 
press so much of simplicity and good nature? 

The third species of names in fiction are 
those exploited in the "comedy of humor." 
Compared with the perfectly characteristic 
ones, they are like a ready-made suit of clothes 
beside one made to order. They are created 
by simply labelling your personage with the 
name of a certain quality. He is introduced as 
the embodiment of an abstract idea. It is an 
easy way to give a character a start in life; 
and if he or she wakes up and becomes a real 
human being, there is no great harm in it. The 
great successes in the characteristic nomencla- 
ture are comparatively few ; in the nomencla- 
ture of humor, they are many. For they not 
only pervade the old comedy from Ben Jonson 



down to Sheridan, but Shakespeare, the great 
essayists, and the novelists are full of them. 
In Shakespeare, side by side with such char- 
acteristic cognomens as Falstaff, Caliban, Mrs. 
Quickly, we have Pistol, Sir Toby Belch, Shal- 
low, and Slender. A vast number of the people 
in Scott, Dickens, and the lesser novelists have 
artificial names of this kind. 

It may be objected that we are making a 
great deal out of nothings, that names are 
mere airy breath and have no reality or fitness 
or prophecy in them. The Neo-Platonists 
made the Logos, the word, the beginning of 
everything. The hero of Poe's story, " The 
Power of Words," breathes a new star into 
words simply by naming it. We think there 
is hardly any reform which would work more 
good in the world than one by which the whole 
race would gradually come to possess appropri- 
ately beautiful or majestic names. However, 
there is always a danger that the christening 
may come to naught. Miss Mitford tells a 
story of a couple named Rose. They had a 
daughter whom they thought it would be poeti- 
cal to name Wild. This did very well until 
she grew up and married a man named Bull.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

ONE WHO LIVED THE LIFE OP A POET, faithful 

in thought and word and deed to a poet's 
ideals, has lately passed from among us with 
little public demonstration of grief at his go- 
ing. Those who have read Mrs. John Albee's 
"Mountain Playmates" will retain pleasant 
memories of the poet and nature-lover whose 
name, with that of his wife, has made Pequa- 
ket, in the New Hampshire hills, a place of 
peculiar interest and charm on the map of 
New England ; for here has been the Albees' 
summer home, as also at times their winter 
home, and here both books and Abnakee rugs 
have been called into being in a memorable 
manner, concerning which there will be found 
some notable chapters in " The Gleam," from 
Mrs. Albee's pen. Mr. Albee's books include 
"Literary Art," "Poems," "Newcastle, His- 
toric and Picturesque," " Prose Idylls," " Re- 
membrances of Emerson," "Lake Chocorua,"" 
"Confessions of Boyhood," and a life of 
Henry Dexter, the sculptor. He was born at 
Bellingham, Mass., April 3, 1833, was edu- 
cated at Phillips Academy, Andover, and the 
Harvard Divinity School, and preached for a 
short time long enough to discover that he 
had greater aptitude for poetry than for pul-

pit-pounding after which he lived for many 
years at Newcastle, an island settlement off 
the coast of New Hampshire near Portsmouth ; 
and it is this little place that he has celebrated 
in one of the most attractive of town histories, 
a work which his friend Mr. Sanborn, of Con- 
cord, speaks of as "more resembling Hesiod's 
recollections of Ascra than Felt's 'Annals of 
Salem.' " His debt to Emerson, a kindred 
soul who like himself had found the pulpit 
untenable, may be partly learned from the 
fifth book in the foregoing list. The poet's 
later years were years of painful illness, cheer- 
fully borne, of enforced seclusion, submitted 
to with contentment, though the recluse en- 
joyed society and was fitted to be its orna- 
ment, of failure to reap any adequate fruits 
from his literary industry, but of no depar- 
ture, through it all, from the modest dignity 
of bearing becoming one who was, in the best 
sense of that term, the captain of his soul. 



THE FOUNT OF FICTIVE TEARS, in which the 
sane and sensible Katie Willows was not wont 
to dabble, has nevertheless a certain unde- 
niable charm for many other equally normal 
and healthy representatives of young girl- 
hood. Juvenile readers take their fiction in 
tremendous earnest, and rather resent than 
enjoy any appeal to their still undeveloped 
sense of humor. Those who have had expe- 
rience in reading or telling stories to children 
will appreciate an article in the current 
" Library Journal " on " The Foreign Child 
and the Book," by Miss Aniela Poray, who 
evidently knows whereof she writes. "Both 
boys and girls," she has observed, " care very 
little for humor in their reading, for it hardly 
comes in their scheme of life. A common 
request from girls is for weepy stories. They 
like ' Sara Crewe ' for many reasons, but the 
fact that it is sad and pathetic is the greatest 
attraction. When books of appealing human 
sympathies can be found which combine also 
literary merit, all is well ; but when this crav- 
ing for weepiness seeks satisfaction in such 
lollipop books as those of Nina Rhoades, the 
librarian has a hard task before her. It is not 
easy to persuade and convince the little girl 
that not having Nina Rhoades there may be 
something else that she would like as well. 
With apologies to Dickens, I found him an 
excellent alternate for Nina Rhoades and oth- 
ers of her kind. The stories of little Paul 
Dombey, David Copperfield, Oliver Twist, and 
Little Nell are pathetic, and the strange En- 
glish setting is forgotten in the meeting of a 
familiar type." With both boys and girls of 
foreign extraction this authority has found 
Lincoln to be a prime favorite in biography. 



" They have reverence akin to awe for Wash- 
ington, they admire the military prowess of 
Dewey or Grant, but Lincoln they love." 
There is certainly no morbid craving for the 
lachrymose in the small boy's eagerness for a 
new book about Lincoln, which when he has 
found and read with approval he recommends 
to the other boys with a " Gee, it's great! " 



GERMANY'S APPRECIATION OF SHAKESPEARE 
seems not to have suffered very much from her 
present rupture with Shakespeare's country. 
When the "Tageblatt" of Berlin not long ago 
solicited the opinion of German scholars and 
men of letters as to what books were best 
adapted to current tastes and needs, the au- 
thor to receive the most votes was found to be 
Shakespeare. His "Henry V." led the list, 
and it is worth noting that it was immediately 
followed by three other English works, Sir 
Sidney Lee's "Life of Edward VII.," Seeley's 
account of "The Expansion of England," 
and McCarthy 's ' ' History of Our Own Times. ' ' 
German interest, naturally a somewhat ma- 
levolent interest just now, in the three last- 
named works is not hard to understand ; but in 
German admiration for the spirited historical 
drama mentioned above one sees something 
very different. In the Bishop of Ely's ex- 
hortation to the young monarch beginning, 

" Awake remembrance of these valiant dead 
And with your puissant arm renew their feats : 
You are their heir ; you sit upon their throne/' 

it is not difficult to shift the scene and imagine 
the apostrophe addressed to the heir of the 
Great Elector, of Frederick II., and of Will- 
iam I., especially as the purpose of the appeal 
is to arouse the king to war against France. 
As was declared by Professor Brandl of the 
University of Berlin, this play is an inspir- 
iting thing to read when there comes the call 
to arms. He is further reported as saying: 
"All that Shakespeare says of his Henry is 
applicable to our Kaiser, and the aggressive 
humor with which he treats the French does 
particular good in these days. ' ' German schol- 
arship has spent itself so unsparingly on 
Shakespeare study that no one can fairly be- 
grudge the Germans such comfort as they can 
in present trials derive from his pages. It 
even appeals to the sense of humor to find 
them turning to their own use against En- 
gland the greatest of England's poets. 



THE READING OF SCHOOL CHILDREN tends to 

become, in these opening days of the ever- 
inviting outdoor season, a negligible quantity ; 
and this is in great part as it should be. Still 
the problem of how to bring together at the 
psychological moment the child and the book

he most needs loses none of its importance 
with the shifting of the seasons. At the 
Library School in Albany, as explained in the 
current record of things accomplished there 
during the past year, added attention is given 
to this question in a newly established "li- 
brary institute open only to district superin- 
tendents of schools." This is one branch 
merely of the regular summer activity of the 
New York State Library School, and the ses- 
sions were attended by thirty-one superin- 
tendents, who took an energetic part in the 
discussions and showed a genuine interest in 
the topics discussed. What aid the State 
gives toward the furnishing of small school 
libraries was learned in detail by those attend- 
ing; and, further, as we are informed, "an 
important feature was an exhibit, classified 
by grades, of several hundred books suitable 
for the first eight school grades. The prac- 
tical character of this exhibit was shown by 
the fact that a number of those in attendance 
used it as a partial basis for books to be recom- 
mended for purchase during the coming year." 
Among the lectures delivered are to be noted 
several on such generally interesting themes as 
"What is Education and Who are Educated ?" 
" The School Library in Agricultural Educa- 
tion," and " Selection of Historical Material 
for Schools," while to those who delight in 
technicalities were offered instructive talks 
on " Some Essentials of Cataloguing," " Clas- 
sification of School Libraries," and kindred 
subjects. ... 

THE IMPROBABILITIES AND IMPOSSIBILITIES OF 

FICTION surely need not be so numerous and so 
glaring as they are. Creative authorship is 
not incompatible with some degree of critical 
sagacity even in regard to one's own inspira- 
tions. Why should Trollope, to cite an old and 
familiar instance, allow himself such absurdi- 
ties as are encountered in his description of 
the pecuniary embarrassments of the hero of 
"Ralph the Heir"? Ralph Newton, a young 
man of twenty-seven, has but recently run 
through the greater part of a considerable for- 
tune, and is reduced to the necessity of asking 
credit from the tradesmen with whom he deals. 
To his boot-maker he is represented to be in 
debt to the extent of two hundred and seven- 
teen pounds a thousand dollars, approxi- 
mately, for boots within perhaps two years! 
And for leather riding breeches his debt to 
Neefit of Conduit Street is equally absurd. 
There is no excuse for this straining of the 
reader's credulity. Sheer carelessness, or 
wantonness, on the author's part, it must be 
called. Of course it is a small matter; but 
why wreck the verisimilitude of a good story 
in this needless fashion? Again, 'to take an 



example from current fiction, in "The Awak- 
ening," by Henry Bordeaux (if that be the 
author's real name), we read in the third 
chapter about a certain "telegraphed letter" 
which in very explicit terms is distinguished 
from ordinary mail correspondence ; yet only 
two pages later a person to whom the mes- 
sage is handed for perusal is made to recog- 
nize the sender's handwriting, "although it 
was stiffer, firmer, with sudden flourishes and 
unfinished letters." Apparently this com- 
munication, so painstakingly impressed upon 
us as a telegram, changes its character in a 
twinkling and becomes an autograph docu- 
ment. We have here to do with an old com- 
plaint of novel-readers against novel-writers, 
as old as novels themselves, no doubt ; but the 
fact remains that it is just such disconcerting 
tricks, or lapses, as this that make the judi- 
cious novel-reader grieve. 
... 

ONE YEAR'S WORK OF OUR LARGEST PUBLIC 
LIBRARY, epitomized in statistical form, makes 
a showing that is, to say the least, impressive. 
In the twelve months ending last December 
the New York Public Library lent 9,516,482 
books for home use, opened four new branch 
libraries, added 201,805 volumes, supplied 
83,319 books by inter-branch loans, served 
1,267,879 readers in adults' reading-rooms, 
lent 26,224 embossed books to blind readers, 
lent 973,856 books by travelling libraries, lent 
4,114,515 books to children, served 1,502,185 
readers in the children's reading-rooms, con- 
ducted 48 reading clubs for children, supplied 
rooms for hundreds of public meetings, gave 
away 300,000 copies of the "Branch Library 
News," lent 649,727 books in 26 foreign lan- 
guages; the Reference Department of the main 
library served 711,122 readers, supplied for 
reference use 2,127,328 books, added to its 
collection 41,727 books and 2,320 pamphlets, 
opened a Manuscript Division, held exhibitions 
of etchings, prints, books, and manuscripts, 
and answered thousands of questions by word 
of mouth, by letter, or by telephone, through 
the Information Division. The Municipal 
Reference Library in the Municipal Building 
was also taken in charge. With pardonable 
pride New York now turns to the other great 
cities of the world with the classic interroga- 
tion, " Can you beat it ? " 

A PRINTER WITH THE SPIRIT OF AN ARTIST 

may raise typography almost to a fine art, if 
not quite. As long as the world reads books it 
will be interested in the Elzevirs and Aldine-; 
and De Vinnes of the printing craft. The 
famous English printer, John Baskerville, has 
recently been made the subject of a rather

notable study from the pen of Josiah Henry 
Benton, LL.D., but the fact that the book 
is privately printed will debar it from the 
wider circulation it might otherwise have been 
expected to attain. This Birmingham writing- 
master and improver of the process of japan- 
ning turned his manual dexterity to good 
account, toward the middle of his fifth decade, 
in designing and cutting type, and it was only 
after becoming a type-founder that he devoted 
himself to the allied industry of printing. The 
story of his famous editions of Virgil and Hor- 
ace and Milton and Addison, and many others, 
is too long to tell here even in outline; but 
from the concluding paragraph of Dr. Benton's 
book a brief passage can be given. " What is 
it," he asks, " that makes the life and work of 
this middle-aged, vain, and silly Birmingham 
Englishman interesting to us? Why do we 
collect his imprints, and why do we talk about 
him? I think it is because he had the true 
artistic vision and courage. He conceived the 
idea of a perfect book, such as had not been 
printed in England. . . . He conceived the 
book as an artist conceives a statue before he 
strikes a blow with his chisel into the marble." 
Baskerville made or supervised the making of 
everything that went into his books ; he printed 
of course on a hand press, and there was noth- 
ing of the roar and rush of a modern printing 
establishment in his little office, which was but 
a room in his dwelling-house. Thoroughly an 
artist in his chosen calling, he touched nothing 
that he did not adorn in the field of printing 
and book-manufacture. 



GREEDY READERS give less offence than do 
gluttonous eaters. Still it is an unpleasing 
spectacle to behold a person in a public read- 
ing-room sitting on a half-dozen of his favorite 
magazines and holding as many more under 
the periodical he happens to be reading at the 
time. The unpleasantness is intensified when 
perchance one has urgent need or compelling 
desire to consult one of the pre-empted pub- 
lications. At one of the branches of the Enoch 
Pratt Free Library of Baltimore the younger 
readers have developed a most astonishing in- 
genuity in hiding their favorite books for 
future use. From the current Report pre- 
pared by Dr. Steiner a rather notably inter- 
esting contribution to this special department 
of literature we quote an incident as related 
by the assistant to whose knowledge it came. 
"One little girl," she writes, "came to me at 
the close of the first day [after the opening of 
the branch] and very proudly told me she had 
put away enough good books to last her a week. 
I tried to explain to her why this should not 
be done, but she evidently did not view things 



in the same light, because, when I was arrang- 
ing the books the next morning, I found seven 
copies of our most attractive fairy tales packed 
very neatly behind a row of the Expositor's 
Bible. ' ' By what precocity of shrewdness did 
that child know that of all books the Bible was 
the least likely to be disturbed ? 


A WASHINGTON IRVING ANECDOTE, by no 
means new, but perhaps all the better for its 
seasoned quality, was appreciatively received 
the other day by the students of the Hackley 
School at Tarrytown, to whom Mr. George 
Haven Putnam, son of Irving's publisher and 
close friend, was relating some reminiscences 
of the famous author. In his infancy Irving 
had enjoyed the honor, or at least submitted 
to it, of receiving the blessing of the great 
man after whom he was named. "But you 
cannot see the place where his sacred hands 
touched my head," the one thus honored used 
to add in his later years when he recounted 
the incident; and the reason of this invisi- 
bility was such a puzzle to the boy Putnam 
that he questioned his father on the subject. 
The answer, if not already known, will sug- 
gest itself easily enough to anyone familiar 
with Irving's portrait and the artist's rather 
obvious indication of the distinguished au- 
thor's indebtedness to his perruquier. This 
story, recalling the quasi-godfatherly relation 
of our first president to our first writer of more 
than domestic repute, prompts the renewed 
query why Irving should have habitually sup- 
pressed the first element of his baptismal 
name and not taken pride in calling himself 
George Washington Irving. A letter of his, 
written in Spain, is said to have recently come 
to light with this full signature appended, in 
proof that he had a good right thereto. 


WHETTING THE READER'S APPETITE with 
tempting titbits from an author's works may 
seem inexpedient to most makers of library 
catalogues, who naturally account it a suffi- 
cient task to record fully and accurately a 
book's author, title, place of publication, and 
date, with any important peculiarities in its 
mechanical make-up. Not so, however, does 
the matter present itself to the compiler of the 
monthly book-lists in the New York Public 
Library's "Branch Library News," a late 
number of which devotes a section to "Poets 
of To-day" and not only names their chief 
works but spares sufficient space to quote, in 
most instances, an illustrative bit of verse 
from those works. Moreover, the fair page of 
this inviting catalogue is undeformed by any 
Dewey or Cutter or other cabalistic symbol 
denoting the book's place in the ranks of its

fellows, so that one may the more sensibly feel 
that one is reading, not a "finding-list," not a 
mere inventory of goods, but an anthology. 
Sixty-one contemporary poets are honored 
with a place in this florilegium. The follow- 
ing lines are from Mr. W. H. Davies's " Songs 
of Joy " : 

" Sing out my soul, thy songs of joy ; 

Such as a happy bird will sing 
Beneath a Rainbow's lovely arch 
In early spring." 


FROM GOWN TO KHAKI has of late been so 
generally the rule at the English universities 
that probably not a third of the customary 
number of students are now in attendance at 
Oxford and Cambridge, and those that still 
pursue the pleasant paths of letters and learn- 
ing at these seats of culture are said to be 
chiefly our own Rhodes scholars or other 
American students, East Indian seekers after 
knowledge, and invalids very manifestly in- 
capacitated for military service. An able- 
bodied young Englishman would naturally 
shrink from showing himself in academic at- 
tire at this time; the training camp or the 
battle-field is, unfortunately, likely to be the 
scene of his activities for some months to 
come. Amid the general economic waste of 
the war must be reckoned the enforced idleness, 
partial or entire, not only of workshops and 
factories, but also of educational "plants" rep- 
resenting incalculable investments of money 
and talent and noble endeavor. "With English, 
German, French, Belgian, Russian, Serbian, 
and Austrian higher institutions of learning 
thus reduced to more or less complete inactiv- 
ity, who can any longer have a good word to 
say for the " educational " influence of war ? 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

A CORRECTION AND SOME OTHER MATTERS. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Perhaps I owe THE DIAL and its readers an apol- 
ogy for a certain annoying slip of the pen which 
occurred in my communication published in your 
issue of March 18. In that number (page 198, line 
5) the word " imperative " should have given way 
to " imperfect." The error certainly escaped my 
notice until it appeared in cold print; but the 
reader who is sufficiently interested may make the 
correction in his own copy, as I have done, and may 
perhaps be charitable enough to ascribe it to such 
a pre-occupation with the poetic subject that sub- 
consciously I could not resist the temptation to 
rhyme upon " narrative " the erratic " imperative." 

Let me take this occasion for expressing my 
agreement with Mr. Ralph Bronson, in the state- 
ment contained in his communication on " War and 
Poetry" in the above-mentioned issue, that "the 
violently partisan spirit pervading most of the 
verse of the present war is chiefly responsible for 



its failure to measure up to high poetic standards." 
The war verse appearing in " The Poetry Review " 
of London, for instance, I think is largely of this 
nature. Why elaborate in metre and rhyme, some- 
times even in the most ambitious forms, what the 
large generality of history may most likely over- 
shadow, or prove untrue, within perhaps the next 
generation? Poetry is the twin-Muse of history, 
if not her elder sister, and scarcely lends herself 
readily to argumentation and debate. Mr. W. N. 
Ewer's poem, " Five Souls," although on the whole 
a step in the right direction, to my mind gives forth 
a certain cynical breath, which in true lyric poetry 
is rather disturbing than agreeable, especially if 
such lines strike us as being inclined to preach " the 
essential folly of war." War is, or has so far been, 
a permanent and indisputable fact of life, and we 
have no assurance that it will not be as recurrent in 
the future as it has been in the past. War cannot 
so easily be spirited away out of human history, 
and for that reason has almost as much right to be 
considered and recognized as a fixity as has peace. 
Anyone convinced of this cannot in the reading of 
anti-bellum verse, feel the pure and unalloyed pleas- 
ure which true poetry ought always to give. 

Finally, I feel constrained to take friendly excep- 
tion to the attitude expressed in this sentence from 
your leading article, in the same issue : " The 
sooner we recognize that life and literature are 
separate businesses the sooner we shall begin to 
produce something worth while in the latter field." 
While I believe that the main principle here set 
forth is indisputably sound, namely, that litera- 
ture, especially " absolute poetry," " must be more 
or less removed from life," it might be well not to 
emphasize this axiom too strongly in that form just 
at the present tune, when the unstable transition 
period through which modern poetry is passing 
would seem to demand that we show the close con- 
nection between the " special language, movement, 
ordering of words and atmosphere " of poetry. 
Certain influential modern poets have already been 
so thoroughly overwhelmed by the idea of the essen- 
tial separateness between poetry and life, that they 
are dangerously near to " prosifying " the classic 
Muse of metre and rhyme. It would therefore seem 
to be more feasible to demonstrate, if possible, the 
close connection between poetry and the facts of 
life: between the movements of life and those of 
rhythm and metre; between the changing aspects 
of life, and the heart and the soul, and the varied 
order of words, of cadences, rhymes, and even 
speech-sounds, in true poetry, as long as the latter 
bears the unmistakable ear-marks of really being 
such. Restrained freedom is the law of beautiful 
living, of nature in her most pleasurable aspects, 
and consequently also of true poetry. True poetry 
is in itself a restraint on the " huge, confused, and 
haphazard " mass of life's facts, and the supreme 
task of the critic of poetry is the establishment of 
some standard by which the fine balance between 
the comparatively lawless freedom of life and its 
often cruel restraints might be judged with some 
accuracy, as well as sufficient flexibility; and not 
only this, but the constant advocacy of the princi- 
ple, that this free-restrained, beautiful balance of 
life-facts be made more and more permanent, and

kept inviolable, in the preservative pages of true 
poetry. If our critic of the future could be great 
enough even to approximate such a working crite- 
rion of judgment, he might conclusively and con- 
vincingly demonstrate the intimacy between life 
and true poetry ; then he might really weigh in this 
delicate balance all verse that came within his ken, 
and cast aside what is found wanting ; and then he 
might be an agent in preserving the purity of true 
poetry unto the generations to come.

LITERARY RECIPROCITY WITH THE LATIN 
AMERICAS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
It seems singular that we who are embarked on 
these two Western continents should be separated 
by idea-proof bulkheads. The lanes of intellectual 
communication all run east and west. Now that the 
great war, like an iron curtain dropping to cut off 
the conflagration on the stage from the audience in 
the theatre, has measurably interrupted our com- 
munications with Europe, perhaps we neighbors 
will begin to pay some attention to each other. 

I am moved to these remarks by a communication 
from Senor Arturo R. de Carricarte, who has been 
the most persevering friend American literature 
has had in the countries south of us. In a review 
first established at Vera Cruz and continued in 
Cuba in the pages of the Havana " Figaro," and 
more lately in the " Heraldo de Cuba," he has for 
years reviewed and exploited American literature. 
He has tried to break down the prejudices, literary 
and political, of his countrymen and kin. He writes 
that it is incredible how many books and articles 
appear in the Latin Americas directed against the 
United States. All the reactionaries in religion or 
politics, and most of those who claim descent from 
Spain or Portugal, are more or less inimical to us. 
He thinks the present is a good time to break down 
this hostility and inaugurate an intellectual confed- 
eration between the Anglo-Saxon and Latin races 
of America. I think he is right. Perhaps now that 
Europe is closed to our globe-trotters and sight- 
seers, the tide of travel may turn southward, and 
people of culture may satisfy themselves as to the 
interest of the Latin American countries and the 
culture, courtesy, and charm of life to be found 
there. 

In this connection I have a suggestion to make in 
regard to the name of our own country. We are 
all Americans, North or South, as all the inhabi- 
tants of Europe are Europeans. Over there, how- 
ever, they make no account of this vague geograph- 
ical title, but pin all their pride and patriotism on 
their national names. It seems to us a case of 
poverty, not a cause for pride, that we have no 
national name. Our official appellation, " United 
States of North America," is formidable enough, 
but poetry is appalled at it and it must take up a 
good deal of room on a passport. Nobody could 
possibly use it affectionately or intimately. Why 
should we not take the initial letters of this title 
and turn it into a name Usona. This would be 
brief and musical, as are most of the great geo- 



graphical and national names Asia, Africa, Italy, 
England, Spain, etc. And it would not be an inno- 
vation, but merely an abbreviation of the old title. 
We could call ourselves Usonians, which would be 
a mellifluous and mouth-filling appellation. The 
idea is a new one, at least, I have never heard of 
it before ; and it really seems worthy of considera- 
tion, c. L. M.

A QUOTATION FROM SOPHOCLES IN 
MEREDITH'S LETTERS. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
In a letter from Box Hill, Dorking, 1901, to Lady 
Ulrica Duncombe, George Meredith quotes lines 
94-5 of Sophocles's " Trachiniae " (Roman letters). 
They read as follows ("Letters of George Mere- 
dith," Vol. II., p. 519) : 

" Ou arola n&x enargomSna 
Tiktei kateunasoi te phlogesomenai." 

They should read thus (Jebb's text) : 
" 'on aiola mix enarizomdna 

tiktei kateunazei te phlogiz6menon." 

Thus it will be seen that, in Meredith's version, 
seven out of eight words contain errors. 

These errors are due, however, not to Meredith's 
ignorance of Greek; for Mr. S. S. McClure says in 
his autobiography that Meredith recited long pas- 
sages of the " Iliad " to him. They must be attribu- 
ted, rather, to his obscure handwriting, of which 
Mr. B. W. Matz has written in " George Meredith 
as Publisher's Reader" ("Fortnightly Review," 
N. S. 86, p. 283, 1909). 

The lines are translated in " The Nation's " re- 
view of the "Letters" (December 5, 1912), as 
follows : 

" Whom spangled night, as she dies away, 
Brings forth, and again lulls to sleep." 

The last word of the quotation is therefore omitted, 
and no comment on the incorrectness of the Greek 
is offered. Other reviewers, as far as I can dis- 
cover, take no notice of the passage.

JEFFERSON'S ARCHITECTURAL WORK. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The writer, having been entrusted by the heirs 
of the late Thomas Jefferson Coolidge, Jr., with 
the publication of the architectural drawings of 
Thomas Jefferson collected by him, and of an ac- 
companying essay on Jefferson's architectural work, 
is desirous of knowing of other drawings by Jeffer- 
son which may be in other hands, and which he 
might be given an opportunity to consult. He 
would also be glad to know of relevant letters and 
memoranda existing outside of the principal public 
repositories of Jeffersoniana, and to secure photo- 
graphs of buildings, locally believed to have been 
designed by Jefferson, which may help to identify 
studies for unknown buildings existing among 
Jefferson's drawings. FISKE KIMBALL.

OUR PAINTER OF THE SEA AND THE 
SHORE.* 

Everything that really adds to our knowl- 
edge of American painting and our love and 
appreciation of it is good, and especially 
when it comes in such form as the essay by 
Mr. Kenyon Cox in a now well-known series of 
monographs on American painters. We have 
spoken of these monographs several times and 
of the excellence of their production, their 
printing, and their pictures. The earlier vol- 
umes have been on George Inness, Homer 
Martin, and Ralph Blakelock, and there have 
been additional numbers with more pictures 
by Inness and by Martin. It is a pity that 
these very useful books should be so expen- 
sive, for the knowledge of American painting 
should be as wide-spread as possible. But one 
can hardly have a quarrel with the publishers 
on that score, unless one should be willing to 
guarantee (if in thought only) the disposal 
of a popular edition. We should like to have 
the public able to have and see the material 
to be found in these handsome books, even in 
less elegant form ; but it is doubtful whether 
the public would back that desire in any sub- 
stantial way. THE DIAL has also in previous 
reviews expressed regret that these volumes 
should not be furnished with some matters 
that would be useful to the student, such as a 
bibliography or a list of the artist's paintings. 
But criticisms like these may be made (and 
have been) on the whole series, and need not 
be repeated now. The interest in the present 
work lies in its presentation and estimate of 
the work of Winslow Homer. 

During the last years of his life, and since 
his death in 1910, Winslow Homer has con- 
stantly risen in general estimation. One of 
the great figures of what may be called the 
second period of American painting, he did 
not come to artistic maturity until the end of 
the last century. But when he did get to 
the power of actual self-expression, he had 
reached so strong and so original an artistic 
personality that he became almost at once a 
figure of the first rank. He was born in the 
same decade as Whistler, Homer Martin, and 
Wyant, and only a dozen years or so after 
Inness, Fuller, and Hunt. But Homer did 
not come to that power of expression by 
which he is really known until he was fifty 
years old. He was recognized early ; he was 
elected to the National Academy before any 
of those just named, who might be considered

his contemporaries. But the work that is now 
deemed his best came later than the chief 
work of those others, indeed after the death 
of several. Homer was one of an earlier gen- 
eration lasting on into our own time, not with 
decreasing power and impaired vigor, but 
with a power and vigor that enabled him to 
do his best work. And this is certainly a 
noteworthy thing. In a generation of all sorts 
of new ideas in artistic aim and technique, the 
fame of so great a man as George Inness 
varies; people who once admired him above 
all will be found to be cold to his art. Homer 
Martin was never popular in his life- time; 
and if I can judge at all, he is not popular 
now. Hunt and Fuller are not well known 
by the average picture lover of to-day. But 
Winslow Homer, who cared nothing for popu- 
larity, and in his later years was apt to say 
he cared nothing even for painting, would 
seem to be growing in public estimation. 
More of his pictures are seen in the great 
collections; more is said and written of him. 
There are, for instance, eight pictures by 
Homer in the Metropolitan Museum of New 
York, which is more than there are of any 
of the other artists just named, beside a dozen 
remarkable water-colors. I would give them 
all for my pick of the Innesses and the Homer 
Martins; but that personal view has nothing 
to do with the general interest that with little 
doubt now holds Winslow Homer to be one of 
the three greatest of our later American 
painters (not living), the other two being 
Whistler and Inness. 

Such a position naturally offers reason for 
such an estimate as that of Mr. Kenyon Cox's, 
and for especial interest in it. How was it 
that this painter who did nothing so wonder- 
ful before 1885, say, should at a time when 
his contemporaries were beginning to cease 
production, be able to create work which 
should gain for him a greater interest than 
that of any of the others, and should do so at 
a time full of new ideas in painting, both as 
regards the thing painted and the way of 
painting it? 

Mr. Cox's essay is an estimate of Homer's 
quality as a painter. He does not attempt a 
study of Homer's life, but accepts the results 
of the work of W. H. Downes, which appeared 
shortly after the death of the painter. What 
is of chief interest in his view, to my mind, is 
that we have here the view of one painter by 
another, put simply and in language that the 
ordinary person can understand. Generally 
when you talk with a painter about art or 
artists he aids his explanation by gesture or 
by painter's phrases, which give his criticism 
a character, but make it hard to understand 



334 



THE DIAL 



[April 29 



except by others of the craft. Here is a view 
of a wholly competent observer, expressed 
with ease and force. 

Winslow Homer was a man noteworthy in 
his generation for the force and singleness of 
aim with which he went about his business. 
He saw much of American life ; in a country 
town as well as in New York, in war as well 
as in peace, in the great woods as well as on 
the New England sea-shore. But he had 
especially, or perhaps finally, a definite per- 
ception such as no other American artist had 
of the greatness and beauty of the sea and of 
the lives lived on or near it. Other things he 
painted too, but this was the thing he loved 
and observed and studied and knew best. He 
was something like Millet. Mr. Cox says: 
" To paint a simple, every-day occurrence, a 
part of the routine of life, and by one's treat- 
ment of it to reveal its deeper implications and 
make manifest the dignity and the romance of 
the life of which it forms a part that is 
what Millet did for the tillers of the soil and 
what Homer does for the fisherman and the 
sailor." 

And with this fully American aim and in- 
terest Homer had such powers as enabled him 
to paint fine pictures. He was direct; care- 
less of convention, of talk, of considerations; 
he wanted the real thing. Further (and here 
Mr. Cox's professional testimony is of great 
value) he was a remarkable master of observa- 
tion, and saw things that no one else saw, and 
painted things that no one else had painted. 
So when he had settled with himself what he 
wanted, and it took him a good while to do 
so, he was apt to render it very truly, or at 
least with a truth that people could appre- 
ciate. Besides which he would make any 
effort to render what he saw and indeed was 
inclined to feel that his " art " consisted 
merely in resolutely confining his painting to 
what he saw. But however that was, he 
desired his painting to grow out of his own 
experience, for he studied with no one. And 
here we need especially what Mr. Cox can 
give us; for here the artist sees easily that 
Homer had certain artistic gifts of which per- 
sonally he was inclined to make slight ac- 
count, chiefly the great gift or sense of design 
and composition, so that he naturally painted 
and selected in such a way as to give the. 
things he painted the sense of life and move- 
ment that is so remarkable in them. 

Something like this is Mr. Cox's estimate of 
Homer, and one can see that it makes him at 
once an interesting man. We would not so 
much comment upon the judgment, as present 
it and call attention to it. Homer had a very 
interesting and even a very American subject, 



and he had a certain definite and exceptional 
power. So now his pictures may stand clear 
in our mind; he is a definite personality, 
more so, I take it, than William M. Hunt, 
who was a greater influence, or than George 
Fuller, who to many is more delightful. Mr. 
Cox, in looking over his contemporaries, thinks 
of no personalities more striking than his, 
except, as we have said, Whistler and Inness. 
I should like to add Homer Martin, and would 
be content to leave the four as representative 
of painting in America in the generation be- 
fore our own. I do not know who else ought 
to be mentioned; Wyant, Tryon, Vedder, 
Blakelock, La Farge, we might think of one 
or another for a moment, but they hardly 
seem to me to belong with the four who have 
been named. Of these four, much has been 
written and printed on Whistler; this series 
of monographs has presented worthy consid- 
eration of the others. We shall watch with 
interest to see who will be the next selection. 
It may add to the value of these considera- 
tions if I add that perhaps owing to the 
lack of them I have never been able to care 
much for the pictures of Winslow Homer. 
Perhaps if I had been better instructed, if I 
had had in mind the finer points of design, of 
composition here spoken of, I might not be so 
impressed as I am with some other things 
that I feel in Winslow Homer's pictures. A 
stray remark made about the " High Cliff " 
when the Evans Collection was exhibited some 
years ago, at the Union League Club I think, 
gives opportunity for some explanation. The 
critic noted "the actual quality of foamy 
water, the soft yielding of it, the invertebrate 
yet unconquerable weight that is its own." 
If a sea-painter could render just those things 
all would be impressed. But in those expres- 
sions (excepting that about the weight of the 
water) the critic seems to me to have picked 
out just the qualities that Winslow Homer's 
pictures do not have. His water to my eye 
has by no means the actual quality of foamy 
water, it is not soft or yielding; and if it is 
invertebrate, it is more like the turtle than the 
jelly-fish. But this feeling of mine that 
Winslow Homer is singularly stiff and solid 
for a great painter seems quite opposed to 
the general opinion, and is certainly very 
different from that of Mr. Cox. I shall not 
pretend to a finer feeling than most, and I 
shall certainly confess to smaller opportuni- 
ties. But I cannot refrain from stating the 
way it appears to me. And I urge anyone 
who thinks I am wrong to go to the Metro- 
politan Museum (or any other place where 
there is a like opportunity; best would be 
the National Gallery, Washington, where is

the picture in question) and look at the sea- 
pictures by Homer. Then if he has ever seen 
the masses of the sea come thundering in 
upon the rocks, he can form his own opinion. 
Whichever way he decides, it is not probable 
that Winslow Homer will care much. He felt 
deeply the beauty and force and greatness of 
the sea and the shore, and he rendered it with 
all the power of his genius, and was content 
to let it go at that. I would not say a word 
which would prevent another seeing that 
great spectacle as he saw it. And Mr. Cox 
has said much that will help. 

EDWARD E. HALE. 



ELIZABETHAN TRAGIC TECHNIQUE.* 

The study of dramatic technique which has 
become so general of late has its unfortunate 
side. It has been perverted. "We are well 
enough pleased that courses of instruction 
should be given, and books written, to pry into 
the advantages and disadvantages of such mat- 
ters as having the hero's cigar go out or the 
phial shown suggestively three times over in 
preparation for the drinking of the fatal 
potion. We realize the need of good technical 
workmanship and of the skilful use of theatri- 
cal devices. But play writing has its strategy 
as well as its tactics. Or, to put the distinction 
in other words, the trivialities so often taken 
for the whole of technique are only a part of 
it ; necessary of course, but subsidiary, auxil- 
iary; not the essential stuff of which great 
plays are made. There is a mental as well as 
a mechanical aspect of drama : an artist's prob- 
lem as well as a juggler's problem ; a work for 
creative imagination as well as a work for con- 
triving judgment. Against the notion that 
' ' technique ' ' is drama we positively rebel. As 
well say that a sleight of hand mastery of allit- 
eration, assonance, variety of pitch and pause, 
can produce unaided an "Eve of St. Agnes"; 
or that an observance of the thou shalt's and 
thou shalt not's of argumentation can produce 
a "Reply to Hayne." 

At a time of so much lecturing and writing 
by those shrewd wits and little souls who fancy 
that, since the tricks of the trade are necessary 
to drama, drama is to be measured solely by its 
employment of the tricks of the trade, it is 
refreshing to find a painstaking study of the 
technique of a great period in tragedy that 
does not stop with external things. Dr. 
Fansler's study, made under the direction of 
Professor Thorndike, is not mindless of the- 
atrical details ; neither is it tied down by them,

glish, University of the Philippines. Chicago : Row, Peterson 
& Co. 



like Gulliver by the cables of Lilliput. It is 
a record and investigation of the successive 
problems that confronted, not the mere crafts- 
men, but the artists of varying greatness, who 
wrought in Elizabethan days. 

With fresh illustrations and orderly pro- 
cedure, Dr. Fansler traces the evolution of the 
elements in the dramatic heritage which fell 
to Shakespeare. The religious drama was 
formless, but it had good situations ; it was rich 
in "acted scenes presenting a not inconsider- 
able amount of realistic spectacle and making 
a strong emotional appeal." Curious par- 
allels are shown between some of these scenes 
and scenes in Shakespeare. The religious 
drama may also in part, through the promi- 
nence it gave to the crucifixion, have caused 
English tragedy, in much more nearly a uni- 
versal way than Greek or Latin, to associate 
death with the catastrophe. The Senecan 
drama furnished a clear dramatic motive, usu- 
ally the motive of revenge. Marlowe showed 
the importance of the protagonist. The first 
distinct mark of Shakespearean technique was 
the development of the antagonist, who was 
vested with individuality and an equal impor- 
tance with the protagonist in the catastrophe 
of "Richard III." 

By far the greater portion of the book is 
devoted to Shakespeare himself. His tech- 
nique is presented as an evolution ; the trage- 
dies are examined seriatim with reference to 
large problems of dramatic art. Thus ' ' Julius 
Cassar" is treated under the caption of "The 
Rise and the Crisis-Emphasis, Including the 
Tragic Incident. ' ' This somewhat formidable 
title loses its terrors when we perceive certain 
things. Brutus, though in part sharing with 
Cassius, is regarded as the protagonist, and 
the play is held to be " the first of our extant 
tragedies in which we see the protagonist defi- 
nitely and steadily rise to a single crisis deed, 
willed by him, expected by the audience, and 
elaborately executed in a well-organized scene 
or scene-group, unpreceded by violent and dis- 
tracting incidents." Hence the word "Rise" 
in the chapter-title. The term "Crisis- 
Emphasis ' ' is equally justified. ' ' Shakespeare 
meant to set Antony forth as a retributive 
antagonist of Brutus, not a contestant from 
the beginning as Hereford with Richard, but 
as one roused to action by a deed. . . . ' Julius 
Caesar' is the first of Shakespeare's extant 
tragedies in which there is clear evidence of a 
consciousness of the crisis-emphasis as a func- 
tional point of structure. ' ' 

There is the obvious risk that intentions will 
be detected which were never in Shakespeare's 
mind. Dr. Fansler obviates this in part by 
warning us that artistic processes are not al- 



336 



[April 29 



ways conscious. There is the possibility like- 
wise that the validity of an idea depends upon 
the point of view. Thus Freytag is attacked 
for censuring Shakespeare because the scene 
is not given wherein Antony decides to return 
to Cleopatra. But were not two possible 
effects open to Shakespeare, one through a 
scene of decision, the other through the undi- 
vided emotion of the catastrophe; and shall 
we either praise or condemn absolutely, since 
a choice was necessary and the emphasis had 
to go one way or the other ? Finally, there is 
the danger that aspects of a problem will be 
overlooked. "The introduction of 'Macbeth' 
is therefore so far better than that of 'Lear, ' ' 
says Dr. Fansler, " as it shows the protagonist 
before the crisis in a rise long enough to assure 
the spectator that the doer of the deed appre- 
ciates his own act. . . . We see Macbeth rise 
from thought to deed." In so far as this 
statement commends the introduction of 
"Macbeth," it will hold. But in so far as it 
implies that the rash act of Lear should be 
made deliberate, it is entirely at fault. Shake- 
speare here had to do with stubborn material ; 
with an act which was indispensable if the 
play was to go on at all, and which yet was 
unbelievable. The more he could inveigle his 
audience into accepting it as a postulate, the 
more he could turn attention from its inherent 
improbability, the better the play would fare 
and the surer sympathy the old king would 
evoke. The introduction of "Lear" shows a 
dexterous lessening of insuperable difficulties. 
Many objections like this might be raised, 
but in the majority of cases no definite conclu- 
sion can be reached; tastes and interpreta- 
tions will continue to vary. Dr. Fansler 's 
study is a helpful one. Its opinions are not al- 
ways new, but they are well-considered. Here 
is its summary of Shakespeare's contribution : 

"What, then, is a Shakespearean tragedy? Is 
it a story ? Yes ; in the sense of ' a body of facts 
of special significance.' All Elizabethan dramas 
were stories. But a Shakespearean tragedy is not 
primarily narrative. Its action is not narrative, 
and herein is Shakespeare's distinction from all 
predecessors. The action of a Shakespearean trag- 
edy is the presentation through stage devices of the 
issuing of events out of character and the issuing 
of catastrophe for that character out of those 
events. . . . Character-action is Shakespeare's con- 
tribution to the world's dramatic literature. Char- 
acter-action is Elizabethan tragic technic at its 
supreme evolution. In a large sense it might be 
said, for contrast, that Greek drama presents the 
struggle of man with events super-beings create; 
Senecan, the struggle of man with events fellow 
beings create ; but Elizabethan, the struggle of man 
with events his own being creates."

AMERICAN EXPAXSIOX ix THE FAR 
WEST.* 



It is not an easy matter to tell the story of 
the annexation of Texas and the conquest of 
New Mexico and California with full enthusi- 
asm and endorsement, especially when one is 
consciously supplementing the work of the 
inimitable Roosevelt. Yet both these tasks 
Professor McElroy has set himself in the four 
hundred pages of his "Winning of the Far 
West." 

How far he has succeeded may be left to the 
reader. But the important events and move- 
ments which have a bearing on the far west- 
ward expansion during the period of 1829 to 
1867 are interestingly dealt with. Andrew 
Jackson and Henry Clay are duly praised, 
though the two leaders were diametrically 
opposed to each other all their lives. That 
Jackson was right in counselling and even in- 
triguing for the annexation of Texas, and that 
Clay was also right in opposing and intriguing 
against the same movement, Professor McEl- 
roy does not attempt to prove; though some 
readers might think he had actually done this. 
Sam Houston is another "hero" depicted as 
doing pioneer service in the great cause of 
American expansion as if the expansion of 
the United States were the most natural and 
righteous things in the world. There is a bit 
of chauvinism that reminds one of French- 
German phraseology in the terms "crowning 
glory" (p. 292) and "glorious conquest" (p. 
297) with which the author describes 'the move- 
ments of the American " army of invasion," as 
though the very term invasion were not sug- 
gestive of a wide departure from the national 
professions. 

Still one may not cavil at an author for 
doing what everyone regards as lawful and 
proper : writing anew an oft-told tale ; and in 
general these chapters present in good form 
and brief space what one finds more elabo- 
rately in H. H. Bancroft's books, or more scien- 
tifically (if one may use an awkward term) in 
Professor Garrison's volume in the "American 
Nation Series." Professor McElroy does not 
attempt to be exhaustive or final, and hence 
one must not apply the standards which might 
be applied to more ambitious writers. His aim 
is to re-present the subject, and to add to the 
national interest in and admiration for the 
leaders who brought such princely domains 
under the ample folds of the American flag. 
Of penetrating analysis or keen criticism of 
the materials used there is little ; nor is there 
anything " new."

THE DIAL 



An opportunity for adding something to the 
store of our present knowledge of the far west- 
ward movement was offered in the unrecog- 
nized leadership of Robert Walker, and in the 
amazing intrigues of the American diplomats 
in Mexico during the period just preceding the 
great war between the States. And there were 
certain features of the Mexican War which a 
more ambitious hand might have essayed to 
describe, though the author's story of Nicholas 
Trist and General Scott is interesting and 
trustworthy. 

The following exchange of compliments be- 
tween General Scott and Nicholas Trist, the 
envoy of the Government, makes amusing 
reading now, though it must have been exas- 
perating indeed to the President, who would 
not punish either party. Scott : " I see that 
the Secretary of War proposes to degrade me, 
by requiring that I, commander of this army, 
shall defer to you, the chief clerk of the De- 
partment of State, the question of continuing 
or discontinuing hostilities." Trist: "You 
will now, Sir, I trust, understand that greatly 
deficient in wisdom as the present (and indeed 
any democratic) administration of the govern- 
ment must necessarily be, it has not fallen into 
so egregious a blunder as to make the trans- 
mission and delivery of that communication 
[a message to the Mexican Minister of Foreign 
Affairs] dependent upon the amiable affabil- 
ity and gracious condescension of General 
Winfield Scott." Few presidents of the United 
States ever contended with so many recalci- 
trant or unruly spirits as did James K. Polk. 
One recalls Scott, who openly snubbed the 
chief executive more than once; Senator 
Benton, who demanded of him almost impos- 
sible things; and Commodore Stockton, who 
declared in public addresses that nothing less 
than the annexation of all Mexico would sat- 
isfy any sensible man. Polk could not remove 
Scott, lest Benton, a civilian without military 
experience, should force his own nomination to 
the vacancy; nor could he punish naval and 
army officers who clamored in public addresses 
for governmental action wholly inconsistent 
with the President's policy. Eeally we have 
fallen upon better times. 

A most interesting subject is this of the win- 
ning of the far west; but only a philosopher 
or an historian without national or sectional 
bias could possibly treat it aright. Think of 
Colonel Roosevelt describing the fall of the 
Alamo or the storming of Chapultepec, the 
" imbecility of Polk," or the " asinine stupid- 
ity " of those who defeated the plan for United 
States control of the Panama canal zone in 
1846 ! Of course, Professor McElroy does not 
attempt the finality of Roosevelt, and conse- 



quently he leaves the reader in doubt now and 
then as to whether it was " manifest destiny " 
or something worse that dictated the course of 
our national evolution. To say that the story 
of the period still remains to be told is not to 
say that this book is a bad one; on the con- 
trary, it is a handy and a reasonably accurate 
work - WILLIAM E. DODD. 



AMERICA AND THE GREAT WAR.* 



As the stream of books pertaining to the 
war flows from the presses of Europe and 
America it brings at intervals a volume which 
by reason of the vigor of its thought and the 
force of its language stands some chance of 
retaining a place in the literature of the sub- 
ject a decade hence. Unquestionably, one such 
book is Mr. Roosevelt's "America and the 
World War." Not that what the ex-President 
has written will commend itself to all classes 
of people. The " peace prattlers," as the paci- 
vists are contemptuously denominated, will 
find small comfort in it ; and the defenders of 
the foreign policy of the Wilson Administra- 
tion will not enjoy the flaying which is admin- 
istered to them. The book may be admitted 
at once to be partisan in tone and at some 
points distinctly unfair. Nevertheless, as a 
straight-from-the-shoulder exposition of the 
elements of strength and weakness in the pres- 
ent position of the United States, by a writer 
whose opportunities to acquire knowledge of 
the subject have been unsurpassed, Mr. Roose- 
| velt's volume must be regarded as one which 
j challenges the attention of every serious- 
| minded citizen. It is a book which, at the 
least, should be provocative of thought and of 
discussion. The course of the author's argu- 
ment can be indicated in a few words. The 
United States should be equally friendly to all 
European peoples "while they behave well," 
and should be considerate of the rights of each 
of them. Peace is ardently to be desired, but 
only as the handmaid of righteousness. The 
peace congresses, and the other activities of the

" ultra-pacivists " during a generation past, 
have amounted to " precisely and exactly 
nothing in advancing the cause of peace." 
All-inclusive arbitration treaties of the kind 
hitherto proposed and enacted are utterly 
worthless, are hostile to righteousness and 
detrimental to peace. " From the international 
standpoint the essential thing to do is effec- 
tively to put the combined power of civiliza- 
tion back of the collective purpose of civiliza- 
tion to secure justice. This can be achieved 
only by a world league for the peace of right- 
eousness, which would guarantee to enforce by 
the combined strength of all the nations the 
decrees of a competent and impartial court 
against any recalcitrant and offending nation. 
Only in this way will treaties become serious 
documents." Such a world league for peace 
is not now in prospect. Until it can be brought 
about, the prime necessity for every free and 
liberty-loving nation is to keep itself in a state 
of preparedness such as to be able to defend 
by its own strength both its honor and its vital 
interest. " The most important lesson for the 
United States to learn from the present war 
is the vital need that it shall at once take steps 
thus to prepare." The preparation which 
the author advocates includes the immediate 
strengthening of the navy, the enlargement of 
the regular army and the establishment of 
a reserve, and the inauguration of a certain 
amount of military training for all the young 
men of the country, after the manner prac- 
ticed in Switzerland. 

A more temperate plea on the same lines is 
contained in General Greene's " Present Mili- 
tary Situation in the United States." This 
little book consists principally of an address 
delivered some months ago in Portland, Maine, 
at the request of the Economic Club of that 
city. In it the author recognizes that the hab- 
itual indisposition of the American people to 
think seriously upon the question of national 
defense has been both natural and inevitable. 
The chances of war have ever been, as they 
have been deemed, remote, and social and eco- 
nomic problems without number have usually 
seemed much more pressing. Within the past 
months, however, as was true in 1898, our peo- 
ple have had their eyes opened to the fact, not 
only that war is not obsolete, but that the 
United States may well be less immune from 
its ravages than had been supposed. General 
Greene asks simply that the occasion be taken 
advantage of to reckon up the facts of the 
existing situation and to derive any lessons 
that may be contained in them. " There is no 
need," he says, "of excitement about it, no 
cause for hysteria. We do not need and will 
not have in this country an army of 700,000 



men, as some ill-balanced enthusiasts demand ; 
we are not compelled to, and we will not, enter 
the battleship race of England and Germany. 
England must run this race or die. We are 
not so situated, and it would be supreme folly 
for us to waste our resources or our thoughts 
in any such contest." It is the judgment of 
the author that, notwithstanding the happen- 
ings of recent months, and barring a clash 
with Mexico, which would amount to little 
more than the exercise of police duty by our 
present forces, the possibility of a war in 
which the United States should be engaged is 
still remote. From Japan there is, he believes, 
very little danger; at any rate, if war with 
that country comes, it will be " made in Amer- 
ica." Still, there is a possibility of a Japanese 
clash, even as there is an insignificant chance 
of a conflict with one or both of the other two 
nations "whose attack would be serious" 
Germany and Great Britain. Arbitration has 
been proved to be not a cure-all. And, despite 
present appearances, we must yet believe that 
military preparedness, up to a certain point, 
does in the long run operate to prevent war. 
The conclusion at which the author arrives is 
that Congress, supported by the sentiment of 
the country, should accede to the requests con- 
tained in the last annual report of Secretary 
Garrison by increasing the mobile forces to 
50,000 men and by taking the first steps 
toward the creation of a reserve. To any per- 
son desiring a temperate and well-informed 
presentation of our actual military status, such 
as can be read and pondered over at a sitting, 
this book can be commended. 

A volume traversing similar ground, but in 
a sketchy and somewhat frivolous manner, is 
Mr. Howard D. Wheeler's "Are We Ready? " 
The contents may have served some purpose 
when printed as a series of articles in 
"Harper's Weekly," but they were hardly 
worth reproducing in book form. If one cares 
for an imaginative record of an attack on New 
York by "the enemy," lent vividness by a 
lurid picture of Madison Square " after an 
aerial raid," one will find it here. 

The writers of the volumes thus far men- 
tioned agree that at some time, and from some 
source, the United States may be involved in 
a great war. Professor Usher assumes more 
confidently the role of the prophet and boldly 
givesi his newest book the sub-title, "A Forecast 
of the Inevitable Clash between the United 
States and Europe's Victor." The United 
States, he tells us, is now facing a crisis with- 
out parallel in her history since the signing of 
the Declaration of Independence. It is not 
the causes of the European war that concern 
us. It is the ending of it ; for, " whatever the

339 



result of this war may be, whoever wins it, 
whenever it ends, the victor will be able to 
threaten the United States, and, if he chooses, 
to challenge our supremacy in the Western 
Hemisphere." The decision which the United 
States makes in relation to the questions thus 
suddenly thrust upon her is to be big with 
consequences. These questions, we are told, 
cannot be evaded. There was a time when the 
country was defended by its isolation rather 
than by armies, and when we had little or no 
motive for interfering in international poli- 
tics. That day is past. Distance has been 
annihilated, and with the extension of our 
economic interests so that they cover the entire 
world the pursuit of firm and even aggressive 
policies has become a possibility, if not a 
necessity. The United States has been drawn 
into the broad current of international affairs, 
and cannot expect longer to enjoy the advan- 
tages of aloofness. The great bone of conten- 
tion is to be Latin America. Of the two 
powers which alone, so far as America is 
concerned, can be victors in the war, Great 
Britain and Germany, both are known to be de- 
sirous of monopolizing Latin American trade ; 
and both, in the event of triumph in the pres- 
ent conflict, may be expected to be greedy for 
political dominion south of Panama. With 
the victor the United States will inevitably be 
brought into conflict, and if there shall not be 
war there will be, at the least, grave danger 
of it. To have war it will not be necessary for 
the United States to become an aggressor ; she 
will need only to seek to maintain her present 
policy of trade extension and political hege- 
mony. The question of what, precisely, the 
United States should do in the emergency that 
now confronts her is propounded forcefully 
and discussed at much length but not fully 
answered. At least, it is answered negatively. 
We are told that "we need not conclude of 
necessity that armament is our true recourse " ; 
although the whole drift of the author's argu- 
ment leads to the conclusion that the defense 
of the nation's economic interests means a 
readiness to use force, and force means arma- 
ment. Another suggested course is the organiz- 
ing of a close Pan-American Confederation to 
protect the Western Hemisphere against Eu- 
rope's aggressor ; yet in a succession of chap- 
ters which form the most carefully considered 
portion of the book there is demonstrated in 
convincing manner (if it required demonstra- 
tion) the fact that differences of race, man- 
ners, and temperament are so fundamental as 
to preclude entirely the practicability of this 
plan. Of criticisms which suggest themselves 
to the reader, the most important relates to 
Professor Usher's propensity for strong, and 



even startling, statements. It is true that 
assertions hardly less startling made in an 
i earlier book have been verified beyond all rea- 
j sonable expectation by the recent course of 
{ events; also that in an appendix to the pres- 
ent work Mr. Usher acknowledges freely the 
necessary tentativeness of much of that which 
is said in the discussion of contemporary 
affairs. Nevertheless, in many portions of the 
text the fault of incautious statement appears. 
Issue may be taken with many specific asser- 
tions made. In respect to the methods by 
which her territorial dominion has been built 
i up, the United States is given a bill which is 
i too clean to be true. And in relation to the 
| major premise of the book one may query 
whether, after all, the war is likely to " destroy 
that close balance of power in Europe upon 
which our past immunity from European in- 
terference has in large measure rested"; in 
other words, whether there will arise from the 
conflict any one "victor" so supremely tri- 
umphant as to be disposed to cast about at 
once, or soon, for a fresh field of conquest. 
There would seem to be a considerable chance 
that the ultimate outcome of the war will be 
so inconclusive that the American situation 
will not be greatly affected by it. 

Among books written by Americans upon 
the war in its more purely European aspects, 
one of rather unique character is Mr. James 
M. Beck's " The Evidence in the Case." Mr. 
Beck is a lawyer, and he was a short while ago 
Assistant Attorney-General of the United 
States. In the present book he has brought to 
bear his legal temperament and talent upon 
the much discussed question of the moral re- 
sponsibility for the war. He enumerates his 
roster of witnesses the sovereigns, diplo- 
matic representatives, ministers, and other 
official spokesmen of the various belligerent 
nations. He then presents the record in the 
case, that is, the White Books, Yellow Books, 
Gray Books, etc., and takes some account of 
the question of suppressed evidence. Finally, 
he examines critically the evidence and ar- 
rives at conclusions concerning all of the im- 
portant episodes and interchanges of the weeks 
in which the war was started. The judgment 
rendered is wholly adverse to Germany and 
Austria, and doubtless by the partisans of 
those powers it will be pronounced unsup- 
ported and unjustifiable. It may be agreed 
that it bears an appearance of conclusiveness 
which neither Mr. Beck nor any other man can 
really attain at the present juncture. Years, 
and probably decades, will elapse before all 
the evidence will be available and before the 
" supreme court of civilization " will render 
its final verdict upon the issues involved.

THE DIAL 



[April 29 



There have been published several other 
American books less judicial in tone and simi- 
larly anti-German. One is Mr. Frederick W. 
Whitridge's "One American's Opinion of the 
European War," which is taken up chiefly with 
an explanation of the failure of the German ap- 
peals for American sympathy. Another is the 
anonymous volume, " Can Germany "Win ? " 
The author of it, we are told, is an American 
citizen who has " constantly been back and 
forth to Germany since the beginning of the 
war." The answer given to the question raised 
in the title is that, while Germany can win, and 
while she has unsuspected strength, the Allies 
also can win, provided England shall nerve 
herself to bear the brunt of the struggle. The 
author predicts that the war will be prolonged 
that before it ends "there will have to be 
put in the field armies which are as yet unre- 
cruited and guns the designs for which have 
not yet been made." 

In his book entitled " The War and Amer- 
ica," published last autumn, Professor Miin- 
sterberg gave expression to his well-known 
views concerning the righteousness of the 
cause of his native land in the conflict now in 
progress. In a volume just off the press, 
" The Peace and America," he returns to the 
subject and renews his plea for a change of 
attitude on the part of Americans toward 
German statecraft, and especially toward the 
German Emperor. Intention or desire to be 
scholarly is specifically disclaimed, and only a 
purpose to be sincere is affirmed. Of sincerity 
the book bears satisfactory evidence. But the 
fact remains that it is simply a piece of special 
pleading, and that it can hardly be expected to 
change the opinions of any thinking person. 
It exhibits an irrepressible tendency to glorify 
Germany and everything German ; while non- 
German nations and peoples come off with 
mention only of their shortcomings. Such 
writing can have little interest save as a dem- 
onstration of how unscientific a scientific man, 
upon occasion, can be ; and demonstrations of 
this sort of thing have grown so numerous 
within the past six months that they may be 
supposed to have lost their power to cause 
surprise or comment. 

Finally may be mentioned a book of very 
different character, Mr. Elbert F. Baldwin's 
" The World War." Mr. Baldwin was in Eu- 
rope at the outbreak of the war, and his book 
comprises virtually a record of the occurrences 
that came under his observation as he moved 
from place to place, first on the Continent and 
later in England. Many chapters of the vol- 
ume were published in " The Outlook " shortly 
after the events which they recount took place. 
To one who desires a light sketch, in diary 



form, of the earlier stages of the conflict, the 
book may be commended. It comprises, not at 
all a history, but an interesting record of the 
impressions which Europe assembling in arms 
made upon a well-informed and conscientious 
American observer.

SOME VARIED CONTRIBUTIONS TO 
PSYCHOLOGY.* 



The accumulations upon a reviewer's table, 
with their chance conjunctions and opposi- 
tions, may at a favorable moment reflect the 
active trends and movements in the selected 
sphere of knowledge, and in so far be pro- 
phetic of its future development. In psychol- 
ogy, the salient impression is one of diversity 
a symptom of fertility. The psychological 
spirit is permeating inquiry in domains out- 
side the psychological territory, and is assum- 
ing new forms within it. In the technical field, 
more critically conducted, more elaborately 
equipped, and more ambitiously conceived 
projects are under way. Applications to edu- 
cation and to vocational pursuits are promi- 
nent, while the amplification of the first aids 
and the more advanced guides to the psycho- 
logically inquisitive proceeds with the multi- 
plication of chairs and students. 

The most notable recent contribution is Mr. 
Shand's book, "The Foundations of Charac- 
ter: A Study of the Tendencies of the Emo- 
tions and the Sentiments." Those familiar 
with this writer's able papers in the English 
philosophical journals will realize the value of 
the systematic statement of his illuminating 
conceptions. The position implied by several 
psychologists, and nearly articulate in James, 
was first distinctly enunciated by Mr. Shand 
and disseminated by its incorporation into 
Mr. MacDougall's " Social Psychology." The 
principle is that the emotions and the instincts 
of response form a mutually illuminating and 
unitary system of expression and direction.

Fear is emotionally the flight (or other pro- 
tective) response instinctively ; anger emotion- 
ally is in terms of impulse a harder and more 
determined assault. With this clue the emo- 
tional nature finds its map in the organized 
impulses. But the boundaries, though largely 
natural features, are promptly rearranged by 
the acquired affiliations of the psychological 
realm. The wealth of impulses is their embar- 
rassment and their redemption. Fusion and 
competitions enter with increasing levels of 
complication. Most distinctively the emotions 
are played upon by intellectual elements and 
the products of their elaboration. Emotions 
thus mature as sentiments, and in that expan- 
sion find an outlet and the direction of their 
growth. Here and here alone, as the founda- 
tion of the psychical life, is established also the 
foundation of character, its only authentic 
psychological basis. Character is the total 
aspect of the organization of the endowment, 
and its focus is in the emotional life. A cen- 
tral point in the elaboration of this position is 
the clustering tendency of emotions and im- 
pulses, the manifold outlets and interactions 
of psychic trends. Such organization produces 
the system of the emotions and the system of 
the sentiments. Emotions are primary as they 
stand close to the definite regulation of vital 
responses or participate in their regulation, 
while about this original centre develop the 
supporting trends in ever-enlarging spheres of 
influence. In the secondary field lie the nice- 
ties of psychological issues and the actual arena 
of human qualities. With this admirable pro- 
gramme, Mr. Shand has formulated a strong 
statement. Yet the source of its strength is 
also in a measure a hindrance, in that the fer- 
tility of the theme has produced an expansion 
of the material quite legitimate and interest- 
ing but confusing. The book is really three in 
one : a statement of the psychological develop- 
ment of character and its central emotional 
basis ; a descriptive and analytical account of 
the varieties of emotional functioning; and a 
diagnostic elaboration of the finer " aesthetic " 
responsiveness of the sophisticated, particu- 
larly the moral agent. Each of these interests 
is well sustained, yet the singleness of purpose 
suffers. Keen diagnosis and suggestive dis- 
tinctions abound, and illustrations that really 
illustrate support an argument that is always 
adroitly handled. Yet so many principles are 
formulated, so many excursions (some of them 
discursive: hence a volume of five hundred 
pages) are undertaken that the trail is readily 
lost unless the reader is as keen in following as 
the writer in leading. The value of the volume 
lies in its psychological contribution to the 
analysis of the emotional life as a support of 



character on the basis of an illuminating, 
clear, and definite analysis. Its place in the 
standard literature of psychology is assured. 

Professor Watson's volume sounds the 
" Behaviorist " note as a challenge to the con- 
servative psychologist. It also presents the 
results of careful research on animal responses, 
and a review of the present status of compara- 
tive psychology. To the behaviorist, the stone 
which the builders rejected has indeed become 
the corner-stone of the temple. If psychology 
will realize that consciousness is as dispensable 
as the soul, and if psychologists will experi- 
ment upon men as the behaviorists do upon 
animals, some practical results will be availa- 
ble and the lessons of psychology be respected. 
In the experimental field the series of re- 
searches reviewed, digested, and interpreted 
show more convincingly than has yet been done 
how rigid must be the conditions upon which 
sound conclusions may be drawn, especially 
when the object is to determine not alone how 
animals behave but upon what orders and 
varieties of distinctions their distinctive be- 
havior is founded. The technique involved in 
determining the color-perceptions of animals, 
and in registering the manner of their learn- 
ing their way through a maze, is an admirable 
example of the logical rigor of modern psychol- 
ogy. Professor Watson is an equally trust- 
worthy guide in interpretation. His account 
of the highest forms of training yet reached in 
the animal mind is highly to be commended. 
It includes consideration of the marvellous 
horses whose performances are recorded in 
weighty volumes, the trained dogs that find 
equally enthusiastic champions, and the en- 
gaging chimpanzee whose anthropoid manners 
are quite deceptive. Yet all these stories carry 
a wholly different flavor and bearing when 
analyzed by the critical psychologist than 
when told by the proud trainer. The source 
of the satisfaction in believing that one's own 
dog or horse or chimpanzee can do what no 
other horse or dog or chimpanzee can do, is 
itself a psychological trait worthy of explana- 
tion. If one contrasts this masterly study of 
Professor Watson's with such books equally 
representative in their day as those of Bo- 
manes, one appreciates the important advances 
which this phase of the study of mind (or, to 
satisfy the behaviorists, conduct) has made in 
recent years. 

No more striking contrast to the direct ob- 
jectivism of the behaviorists could be found 
than the involved subjectivism of the Freudian 
tendency in psychology. Dr. Freud's thesis 
has become a common topic of informal as well 
as informed conversation, while the practice of 
psycho-analysis caters to the interests of those 



342 



THE DIAL 



[ April 29 



fond of viewing personal details in an engag- 
ing light. The thesis holds that trifles are 
significant because uncensored, and that the 
mind is a maze of suppressed and distorted 
motives ; that lapses are not accidents but re- 
pressions, usually with a sex clue; that dis- 
agreeable things are put out of the mind to 
hide the trace of our guilt, though it will out 
when the psycho-analyst gets you. Dr. Freud's 
" Psychopathology of Everyday Life " is now 
accessible in a good translation made by Dr. 
A. A. Brill of New York, a prominent repre- 
sentative of the Freudian practitioners. The 
volume carries the thesis to such common inci- 
dents as forgetting a name, a foreign word, an 
impression ; as mis-speaking and mis- writing ; 
as doing things unintentionally, or other types 
of lapses, faults, and habits. In all these there 
is method in one's momentary madness, the 
secret of which lies in the unconscious and 
unsuspected if not disowned past, which is 
retired in the interests of the present. The 
thesis is attractive, though the details are often 
tedious ; some parts of the book read like the 
inflated notes of an ingenious mind. But is 
this the true picture of the normal course of 
the mind's daily habit ; and are we deceivers 
ever, for lack of better subjects deceiving our- 
selves? Doubtless privacy is essential to psy- 
chical complexity, and reticence grows even to 
an obsession in an ingrown mind. But to ban- 
ish the casual from psychology is to deny it 
small talk and vacations, and to make recrea- 
tion a misnomer. A jest, it is true, often masks 
a deeper purpose; and yet the spirit of it is 
for the most part just fun. If sleep were 
always a sojourn in a chamber of Freudian 
dreams, it might be more restful to remain 
awake; while with the best of intentions and 
an adequate psychological insight many a psy- 
chologist can find in his own errors and slips 
and gaucheries nothing but stupidity, defec- 
tive observation, brain wandering, and the 
idlest of fancies. That a slight tinge of abnor- 
mality may readily give the mind a Freudian 
twist, or that an intellectual over-introspec- 
tiveness not quite adequately supported by 
critical control may do the same, is a plausible 
view. But that such an occasional interlude 
dominates or does anything but intrude seems 
questionable. To certain temperaments, be- 
tween the dark and the daylight of health or 
mood there comes a lull in the mind's occupa- 
tion that is known as the Freudian hour. 

As painstaking as the studies of animal be- 
havior are the records of the feeble-minded 
contained in Dr. Henry H. Goddard's authori- 
tative volume. The conspicuous lesson of the 
three hundred and more cases of mental defect 
here recorded is the inevitably hereditary char- 



acter of the taint, and to a remarkable degree 
(considering the complexity of the data) their 
conformity to the requirements of Mendelian 
heredity. The defect is of many degrees, and 
is best expressed by the mental age as revealed 
by special tests and general conduct. The idiot 
has the mentality of a three-year old or even of 
a less mature child ; imbecility carries on the 
development to six or seven years; while the 
lighter grades of defect and the moron show an 
irregular capacity comparable in many re- 
spects to that of a normal child of nine, ten, or 
eleven years. Here development stops, though 
physical growth (itself at times stunted) con- 
tinues. Some cases deceive even the expert 
teacher, and encourage him to look for a nearly 
normal issue, when progress sets in ; but there 
is always disappointment in the end. The 
story stops and the limitations of heredity are 
final. The moral of the silk purse and the 
sow's ear remains. This lesson is an unwel- 
come one to an optimistic democracy, to which 
opportunity is a solvent or a magic potion, 
and native ability a disturbing intrusion into 
a well-ordered society of unobtrusive equals. 
The lesson may be extended: for it implies 
that for every score of high-grade defectives, 
there must be hundreds of just higher endow- 
ment who form the great armies of the dull 
and dense to whom the work of the world must 
be adjusted. It is the poor in intelligence that 
we shall always have with us. The problem of 
incompetence is scarcely as serious to the social 
philanthropist as the problem of crime, so 
much of which is due to mental defect. A 
high-grade defective leads a safe life in the 
sheltered environment of the Vineland School ; 
the environment of a city dooms him utterly ; 
and society pays the bill in the cost of crime 
and institutional care. In this field the eu- 
genic argument is convincing ; if we cannot as 
yet secure the best parentage, we can cut off 
the worst. Dr. Goddard's tables are illumi- 
nating, as are in general his interpretations of 
the several conditions which aggravate the 
menace of mental defect. The modern note 
dominates the volume, giving it the flavor of a 
laboratory study, a case record, or a field 
report. 

Dr. Goddard has also reported upon the pro- 
visions for " The School Training of Defective 
Children," and the means to be taken for their 
recognition and special consideration in the 
public schools. Dr. Wallace Wallin's volume on 
" The Mental Health of the School Child " con- 
tains a series of careful studies (reprinted 
from the technical magazines) dealing with 
special aspects of the educational and the psy- 
chological questions that arise in the care and 
study of the mentally defective. Special at-

tention is directed to the hereditary aspects of 
the problems (eugenics), and to the corrective 
measures (euthenics), that promise the relief 
of these unfortunate conditions inherent in the 
distribution of human quality. 

The very title of Mrs. Burr's book, " Relig- 
ious Confessions and Confessants," seems a 
refutal of the Freudian principles of suppres- 
sion, yet it is actually its complement. For the 
relief which the psycho-analyst releases is by 
way of confession, by way of a verbal ex- 
plicitness which, like the flow of tears, finds a 
vent for pent-up tension. Nature and religion 
are sympathetic psychologists. Mrs. Burr's 
essay is an able venture in a difficult field. It 
requires a comprehensive historical grasp of 
the moving centuries and the setting which 
they give to the documents in the case, and a 
psychological grasp of the underlying affinities 
of expression and mood, despite the local color 
and the imposed limitations of their origin. 
The result is a contribution of sterling value. 
The written confession is a phase of the auto- 
biographical intention (the subject of an ear- 
lier volume by Mrs. Burr) which, if carried out 
with Dantesque singleness of purpose, would 
approach the inviolable sanctity of the psycho- 
analytic moment. The tenuous duplicity is 
involved in the intention to be read, in the 
extreme reaching Heine's satirical view of 
feminine writers who are described as having 
one eye on the manuscript and the other on a 
man. The religious confessant has least temp- 
tation to be a poseur; for despite the protean 
type, he or she has the courage of self-knowl- 
edge that divides between the lure of introspec- 
tion and the shriving self-communion. The 
most naive or candid or healthy-minded (as 
James would say) of the confessants are the 
Gurneys (one of the many Quaker records 
which Mrs. Burr has incorporated in her re- 
searches), for whom meditating and journal- 
izing were the family dogmas ; the young ladies 
of the family intermingle reflection upon God 
and a future state with attention to very 
worldly and innocent pleasures. The central 
portion of the volume is inductive, and pre- 
sents an array of data the interpretation of 
which, despite the contrasting setting of time 
and place and religious affiliation, results in 
an orderly set of conclusions. The correlation 
of feeble health with introspective intensity is 
clear, as is also the special relation of periods 
of decline in physical vigor with moments of 
conversion. The encouragement of the environ- 
ment, the strong hereditary trend, the precipi- 
tation of the crisis by gripping experiences, 
the vestigial character of the manifestations, 
the influence of the group contagion, all these 
play a part in the genesis of the varieties of 



religious experience of which the confessions 
are an expression. The trends that lead to 
mysticism, to introspective indulgence, to an 
ascetic self-castigation, as well as those illus- 
trating the abnormal hazards of the mind 
(such as the witchcraft confessions and accusa- 
tions) , further extend the scope of the inquiry. 
By a discerning combination of the inductive 
method so variously fruitful in modern psy- 
chology with a sympathetic insight into the 
significance of very complex phases of the 
inner life conferred by a well-trained histori- 
cal sense, Mrs. Burr has made a valuable con- 
tribution to the psychology of the religious 
life. 

The strong if not dominant sociological 
trend in recent psychology is well represented 
by Mr. Graham Wallas's " The Great Society," 
which he properly terms "A Psychological 
Analysis." The " great society " is the result 
of the radical reconstruction of the forces of 
social control brought about by the extension 
of mechanical aids and economic development 
and the insight into the forces responsible 
for human progress. Conscious evolution has 
replaced subconscious strivings and groping 
subjection to forces beyond control because 
beyond the ken of attained comprehension. 
What remains permanent is the dominance of 
the fundamental psychological trends which 
have brought mankind slowly to the present 
stage. Habit, fear, pleasure and pain, the so- 
cial impulses leading to love and hatred, and 
the trend of thought intertwining weakly 
among them and in later stages supporting the 
total growth, these were and are the actual 
forces competing in society for expression and 
organization. As one or another of these origi- 
nal trends is made central, there arise " habit " 
societies and a " habit " psychology among the 
students of human affairs ; similarly a " fear " 
society and a " fear " psychology ; a " sympa- 
thy" society and a "sympathy" psychology; 
a " thought " society and a " thought " psychol- 
ogy. Mr. Wallas's volume is a popular one, 
and the theme is reduced to the sharp contrasts 
alone possible when a coarse brush is used. The 
effect is impressionistic but strong. It is signifi- 
cant that a student of society finds it essential 
to present his views on the basis of a careful 
psychological analysis of the motive sources of 
human conduct; though it must be admitted 
that his strong interest in social trends of the 
day make his transitions from principle to con- 
clusion somewhat violent or detached. We all 
look upon the tendencies operative here and 
now through the powerful microscope of prac- 
tical interest ; the corrective of the large evolu- 
tionary distance is indispensable. Mr. Wallas's 
practical motive is to influence opinion in the 



344

organization of thought and will. The sociolo- 
gist often runs away with the psychologist. It 
is important that a book of this type shall be 
available, because so many persons are busy 
with one or another aspect of the problem of 
social control, and these require a presenta- 
tion suitable to their needs and habits of com- 
prehension. In the . psychological view, the 
European catastrophe (which, by the way, is 
foreshadowed by Mr. Wallas with a startling 
prophetic insight) is far less a battle of arma- 
ments than a contest of ideals. The decision at 
stake is the perspective of importance to be 
assigned to the directive trends of human na- 
ture in the socially matured system under 
which life must proceed. 

For the making of texts in psychology, 
classes and publishers are largely responsible, 

unless the inadequacy of professors' salary 
is the efficient cause. Such texts must usually 
be reviewed from the pedagogical aspect : Will 
the student mind accept them and profit by 
their use ? It is safe to predict that whatever 
Professor Miinsterberg writes will reflect the 
fertility of his versatile endowment and the 
comprehensiveness of his command of the sub- 
ject. To the teacher of psychology his latest 
text-book will be distinctly helpful. It is a 
well-sustained presentation, and differs from 
many texts in its inclusion of applied psychol- 
ogy in a readable survey of education, law, 
medicine, industry, and culture, as they em- 
body psychological principles and their work- 
ings. What is ordinarily incidentally noted in 
connection with analysis is here brought to a 
systematic presentation. As for the adapta- 
bility of the text to the student, one man's view 
or guess is doubtless no better than another's. 
It seems to the present reviewer that the stu- 
dent's reaction to this type of text will be 
either neutral or belligerent. It seems pecu- 
liarly neglectful of the psychology of the stu- 
dent's mind ; and it errs in one essential respect 

an error almost scholastic in its temper: 
namely, the insistence upon "methodology." 
The division of "causal psychology" and 
" purposive psychology," the contrast of " the 
two psychologies," is the very basis of the book. 
This is precisely what the student should not 
be troubled with ; it is the teacher's business to 
conceal the fact that he is troubled by it him- 
self. It is in despite of the plan of the volume, 
rather than by virtue of it, that the result is 
valuable. 

Professor Ogden writes his " Introduction to 
General Psychology " with the literal purpose 
of surveying the essentials of the field in the 
briefest possible compass. This involves a sum- 
mary manner throughout, even to the sugges- 
tion of the replacement of the notes which a 



brilliant student might adapt to his own pur- 
poses. With the purpose so definitely con- 
ceived, and the position (approximately that 
of the Wiirzburg movement in psychology) 
equally pronounced, the execution follows the 
perspective of importance which the several 
topics are assigned in the instructor's mind. 
The divisions are clear : an analytical review ; 
a synthetic construction ; an applicational sur- 
vey. All this has been done with skill, patience, 
discretion. 

A survey, like the present review, which in- 
cludes in one sheaf the psychology of charac- 
ter, of obscure moments in every-day life, of 
religious experience in autobiographical data, 
of the defective classes, of the social move- 
ments of the day and generation, is sufficient 
to indicate the perplexities of the writer of 
texts who wishes to present the established 
doctrines and to reflect the current trends of 
interest. JOSEPH JASTROW. 



RECENT FICTION.* 

Mr. Harrison has scored again with "An- 
gela's Business," although not quite as effec- 
tively as with its two predecessors. The hero 
lives in some idyllic town where it is possible 
for him to earn, as a private tutor, not merely 
a living, but the means of providing for a 
luxurious apartment, and the services of a 
private secretary. He is also by way of being 
a writer of novels and short stories, but as 
these effusions are almost invariably returned 
to him with complimentary regrets by unap- 
preciative editors and publishers, they do not 
contribute materially to the elucidation of the 
economic mystery of his existence. The chief 
subject of his researches as a fictionist is 
Woman, which he thinks he understands in all 
its manifestations, and he jots down felicitous 
epigrams about it as they occur to him. He 
eventually discovers that his psychology has 
been superficial, and that intimate emotional 
relations with individual specimens of the sex 
must enter into a novelist's equipment before 
he is really qualified to write about it. His 
chief personal contacts are with the two speci- 
mens Angela and Mary. The latter is a some- 
what strenuous creature of the type commonly 
known as "advanced," a teacher in the local 
high school, whose chief ambition is to secure 
the secretaryship of a national educational 
organization. She is not presented in a very 
alluring light, whereas Angela is charmingly

feminine and appealing. Her " business," un- 
blushingly avowed, is that of being a " home- 
maker," which means that she is primarily bent 
upon ensnaring a suitable male with whose aid 
to construct the home of her imaginings. It 
looks as if the hero were destined to become 
her prey, but Mary is the one who finally car- 
ries him off, a success to which we are not alto- 
gether reconciled. The author brings this 
about by a series of deft moves whereby Mary 
grows upon us and Angela grows away from 
us, the former developing hitherto unsuspected 
qualities of womanliness, while the latter is 
revealed as the embodiment of selfish calcula- 
tion and insincerity. She does not exactly 
appear in the character of a minx or a cat, but 
her development is obviously tending in that 
direction at the time when the hero discovers 
that Mary is the realization of his ideals, and 
informs her of the conclusion that he has 
reached. The manner in which this story is 
related is sparkling and whimsical; it is far 
from being a remarkable novel in any serious 
sense, but it is undeniably an entertaining one. 

" Ruggles of Red Gap," by Mr. Harry Leon 
Wilson, is the story of an English valet trans- 
planted to the wilds of western America. His 
master, the Honorable George (surname unin- 
dicated) , enticed into a game of " drawing 
poker " by some Americans visiting in London, 
stakes Ruggles and loses him, which means 
that the valet must depart with his new master 
for Red Gap, which seems to be a metropolis 
situated among the Rocky Mountains. The 
saying that men change their skies but not 
their souls is measurably illustrated by Rug- 
gles's career in his new surroundings, but he 
finds himself, despite his efforts to keep his 
place, elevated by circumstance into a social 
position of some consequence in Red Gap, and 
when we take leave of him, he is by way of 
developing into a passable imitation of an 
American citizen. His experiences are sur- 
prising, and often farcical, but he remains un- 
perturbed by a rise in the world of which he 
could not have dreamed in the early days be- 
fore he became the arbiter elegantiarum of 
Red Gap society. The story abounds in a 
species of humor of which the following is a 
typical specimen : 

u I gathered at once that the Americans have 
actually named one of our colonies ' Washington ' 
after the rebel George Washington, though one 
would have thought that the indelicacy of this 
would have been only too apparent. But, then, I 
recalled as well the city where their so-called par- 
liament assembles, Washington, D. C. Doubtless 
the initials indicate that it was named in ' honour ' 
of another member of this notorious family. I 
could not but reflect how shocked our King would 
be to learn of this effrontery." 



A little of this sort of thing goes a long way, 
and such humor rather palls when supplied in 
the generous measure with which Mr. Wilson 
bestows it upon us. 

It will be a long time before we get the real 
fiction of the great war such work, for ex- 
ample, as " Richard Dehan " and Mr. Frederick 
Palmer have it in them to write. Meanwhile, 
those among our novelists whose aim is pri- 
marily entertainment are rapidly seizing the 
new opportunity, and giving us episodical tales 
of essentially private and sentimental interest, 
having the war as a decorative background. 
Such stories are the "Who Goes There!" of 
Mr. Chambers and the "Little Comrade" of 
Mr. Stevenson. The former is the more serious 
and full-bodied of the two, but we expect 
something much better of the writer to whom 
we owe the series based upon the Franco- 
Prussian War and the American Revolution. 
Mr. Chambers puts his historical judgments of 
the war into three prefatory pages of prose 
and verse, leaving them otherwise to be in- 
ferred from the action of the romance that 
follows. His verse yields such a picture as 
this of martyred Belgium : 
" Withered the magic gardens which were mine ; 
Eden, in embers, blackens in the sun ; 

Rooting amid crushed roses the Wild Swine 
Still root, and spare not one." 

In his prose he gives a succinct statement of 
the reasons why America can have no sym- 
pathy for the German cause, concluding with 
these words: "We know that the cause of 
Imperial Germany is wrong; her civilization 
is founded on propositions impossible for any 
American to accept ; her aims, ambitions, and 
ideals are antagonistic to the progress of com- 
munal and individual liberty as we understand 
the terms. And that settles the matter for us." 
The hero of " Who Goes There ! " is an Amer- 
ican of Belgian descent, who is about to take 
his place in the Belgian army when the coun- 
try of his ancestry is violated by the barbarian. 
Taken prisoner by General Baron von Reiter, 
he is reprieved on the condition that he will go 
to England and rescue the General's ward, and 
escort her to his Luxembourg estate. Failing 
this, he promises, like Regulus, to come back 
and be shot. He finds the young woman, and 
sets out with her for the Continent. But she is 
already under suspicion of being a German 
spy, and has, in fact, certain important' papers 
revealing the whereabouts of the English fleet 
and other matters. Every step of the journey 
is dogged, and there are many exciting escapes 
from arrest. As for the compromising papers, 
the hero gains possession of them, and thus 
prevents them from falling into the hands of 
the enemy. The General, who has hoped to 



346 



THE DIAL 



[April 29 



wed the young woman, finds, when they meet, 
that the American has stolen her heart, and, in 
a hand-to-hand encounter, is badly wounded. 
Thereupon, with incredible magnanimity, he 
relinquishes his suit, and provides the lovers 
with every facility for going over the lines 
into Belgium. The expected happy romantic 
ending is inferred rather than portrayed. The 
story has an excess of the conversational pad- 
ding at which Mr. Chambers is an adept, but 
it has also much dramatic action and a quan- 
tum satis of sentimental interest. 

Mr. Stevenson's story is of the thinnest tex- 
ture, and is also concerned with the romance 
of an American hero and a beautiful spy. 
This girl is from Strasbourg, and has in her 
possession some plans of the fortifications at 
Metz, which she hopes to place in the hands of 
General Joffre. The police are on her track, 
and she flings herself into the arms of the 
American hero, a surgeon on his way home 
from Vienna, and caught in Aachen at the out- 
break of the war. A deft manipulation of his 
passport adds to his name the words " accom- 
panied by his wife," and upon this pretence, 
she persuades him to extend to her his protec- 
tion. The pair have a lively time in getting 
across the Belgian frontier, and have to hide 
in wheat-fields and gullies, make forced 
marches by night, and swim the Meuse. They 
are both wounded, but evade capture, and the 
hero takes the plans to the French camp, where 
the invisible ink is made to yield up its secrets. 
We leave the heroine in a German hospital, 
where she is being nursed back to health with- 
out any suspicion of her real character on the 
part of the authorities, and we are left to 
imagine the reunion with the man to whom she 
owes her safety. She makes a very charming 
and resourceful heroine, and the ingenuity 
with which she extricates herself from difficult 
situations excites our deepest admiration. 
What the author thinks about the whole busi- 
ness of the war is made fairly evident by his 
hero's comments upon the invasion of Bel- 
gium, and by his offer of his professional 
services to the French army.

NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

Something of Frank Stockton's delightful irre- 
sponsibility and inconsecutiveness appear in Miss 
Ellenor Stoothoff's "The Nightingale" (Hough- 
ton), which tells of a New England wife and mother 
who flies from home and family to effect her own 
cure from a serious attack of nerves by rambling 
unprotected through Europe. In Italy she takes 
on a young girl as maid, and adopts two lambs. 
These latter ail slightly, -so she embarks for the 
spot where Southdown mutton comes from, as 



possessing the climate necessary for their well- 
being. It has been understood between her and her 
complaisant husband that she will return when she 
hears a nightingale sing. He, after what he regards 
as a sufficient deprivation, arrives in Paris, where 
he buys what he is told is a nightingale, and takes 
it over to her in England that she may hear its song 
and justify his arrival. She, meanwhile, has been 
acting the part of a beneficent fate for various lov- 
ers, one of them a plumber and the other a chauf- 
feur. It is all pleasantly plausible and amusing. 

What an intelligent husband and wife can do in 
avoiding divorce by removing the causes for sepa- 
ration is set forth by M. Henry Bordeaux in " The 
Awakening" (Dutton), which has been translated 
by Miss Ruth Helen Davis from the ninety-fifth 
edition in French. A brilliant writer marries a 
charming girl, who, having borne him a son and 
daughter, is quite content to rest on her ante- 
marital laurels so far as charm is concerned. An- 
other woman, brilliantly intellectual, crosses the 
writer's path after years of baffled hopes and an 
almost complete waning of mutual interests. The 
outraged wife returns to her people and begins a 
suit for separation, holding herself innocent of the 
collapse of their married life. A diary kept by 
him is placed in her hands, and her failure to meet 
his ambitions is made clear thereby. She sets 
about rehabilitating herself in her own eyes, thus 
opened; and in the course of years attains to her 
husband's standard of what a wife should be. The 
book deserves wide reading. 

Mrs. Edith Henrietta Fowler's latest romance, 
"Patricia" (Putnam), has a genuine, if somewhat 
worldly, piety running through its pages. Patricia 
is the only daughter of an eminent man of letters, 
widowed at her birth. His death sends her to an 
uncle, vicar of a rural parish, as earnest and gener- 
ous of self as he and his family are narrow. The 
girl's impressions of religion as a dull and rather 
sordid business are confirmed by the life her kins- 
folk lead, her agnostic training blinding her to the 
spiritual beauty beneath. She is awakened by her 
love for a clergyman of high rank, who takes her 
into a society even more cultivated than her father 
had thrown about her, and eventually brings her to 
the Light. Patricia is an excellent example of a 
witty simpleton, to say nothing worse of her; but 
her slightness of character detracts little from the 
interest of the story. 

In the death of Monsignor Hugh Benson, the 
Roman Catholic Church has lost the ablest novelist 
in her cause she has ever had in England ; and his 
posthumous story, "Loneliness" (Dodd), serves to 
confirm this fact. It deals with contemporary life, 
and its protagonist is a young Catholic English- 
woman who achieves a marked success on the oper- 
atic stage. This success so interests the scion of a 
recently ennobled house that he secretly affiances 
himself to her. Meanwhile her youthful devotion 
to religion grows pallid, until she determines to 
marry her Protestant lover regardless of churchly 
regulations. A slight surgical operation deprives 
her of her glorious voice; she turns to the old 
religion and dismisses her lover, now grown luke- 
warm, and the close suggests the cloister.

It is inevitable that the fascinating figure of the 
fourth Amen-hotep, self-named Akhenaton, should 
be connected with that of Moses, since the purity 
of the Pharoah's religion bears no slight resem- 
blance to that of the great Jewish lawgiver. Cer- 
tain chronological obstacles have not been allowed 
to stand in the way by Mr. Frederick Thurstan in 
"The Romances of Amosis Ra" (Lippincott), the 
hero of which is none other than Moses himself. 
Such portions of the Scripture as could be made to 
fit are utilized to the full, and a magical atmosphere 
is created, in the spirit of the miracles of the exo- 
dus. The romances are two, the first ending with 
the birth of the prophet, the second with his retire- 
ment to the land of Midian after his slaughter of 
the Egyptian. The author's earnestness and learn- 
ing are much in excess of his ability to write 
convincingly. 

" The Graves at Kilmorna : A Story of '67 " 
(Longmans) is an earnest tale of the abortive 
uprising of the Irish against British oppression in 
1867, when veterans of the American Civil War 
returned to their native land to assist in obtaining 
its independence. It is the work of the Very Rev. 
Canon P. A. Sheehan, D.D., and is a close and con- 
clusive picture of the times in which it begins, and 
a profound criticism of these later days. A youth- 
ful Irish idealist and freedom worshipper seeks 
death in the cause in order that his countrymen 
may gain the stimulus that he believes will follow 
this voluntary martyrdom. His life is spared, but 
he spends ten agonizing years in prison before he 
is pardoned. The end of the tale is tragic in every 
sense of the word. Few more sincere stories have 
been written of Irish Catholic life. 

Spain in the days of the weak and unfortunate 
Philip IV., with his prime minister, Olivares, as the 
leading figure, provides the scene for Miss Amelia 
Josephine Burr's "A Dealer in Empire " (Harper). 
A beautiful girl, niece to a celebrated actress and 
herself successful in her brief career upon the stage, 
furnishes the necessary appeal to the sensibilities. 
She is beloved by a young nobleman and by the 
King himself, but yields herself rather to the higher 
appeal made by the minister, to whom she bears a 
son. His ambitions take him from her, and place 
her in retirement. The conclusion is admirably 
worked out, in accordance with ideas of sentimental 
justice. Simple and easy in style, direct and com- 
pact in substance, this is an historical novel fully 
romanticized. 

Miss Mary Bride reappears with all her common- 
sensible charm in Mr. Edgar Jepson's " Happy 
Pollyooly" (Bobbs-Merrill Co.); as do also her 
small brother " The Lump," her employer the bar- 
rister, and nearly all the other personages of the 
story of which this is the sequel. Pollyooly is a 
most engaging young person who has the knack of 
coming safely out of all adventures, however com- 
plicated, and always with a substantial sum of 
money in her possession. There is a somewhat 
long-drawn-out episode having to do with a prince 
of the House of Hohenzollern which, vce fear, does 
injustice to that doughty line's conceptions of 
education.

BRIEFS ONJNEW BOOKS. 

At desolate Babylon, once mis- 
tress of Hither Asia, excavations 
by the Royal Museums of Berlin 
in conjunction with the Deutsche Orient- 
Gesellschaft have been in progress since 1899. 
An account of net results up to the spring of 
1912, written by Dr. Robert Koldewey, in 
charge of the work, and first published in 1913, 
has already reached its third German edition. 
The hoped-for English version is also now 
available in a volume entitled "The Excava- 
tions at Babylon" (Macmillan). Mrs. Agnes 
S. Johns has made a free and idiomatic trans- 
lation which well reproduces the effect of the 
original. Awkward sentences occur rarely, 
likewise minor discrepancies of fact. Suc- 
cessive discussions of the separate features of 
the city form the bulk of the volume ; a retro- 
spect sums up the career of Babylon as a 
whole. Its site was inhabited even in prehis- 
toric times (pp. 88, 261, 311). The water- 
level, however, higher now than in antiquity, 
prevents excavating below the stratum of 
Hammurabi (2123-2081 B.C.), the great law- 
giver of the Babylonian First Dynasty. The 
residence district of Merkes best reveals the 
course of Babylon's history, from the early 
state of Hammurabi down through the inglo- 
rious Kassite sway and the period of Assy- 
rian domination to the Chaldean empire of 
Nebuchadnezzar and beyond. For that empire 
succumbed to the Persians (538 B.C.), who 
in turn fell before Alexander (331 B.C.). 
The Greek period was followed by the Par- 
thian (139 B.C.), the latter by the Sassanide 
(A.D. 226). Scattered dwellings existed in 
Merkes far down into the Arabic period (be- 
gan in 636), perhaps as late as A.D. 1200. 
Since then, however, the whole site of the 
ancient city has been deserted. As the Assy- 
rian Sennacherib had razed Babylon in 689 
B.C., the most imposing remains discoverable 
begin with the brilliant reign of Nebuchadnez- 
zar (604-561 B.C.), when the rebuilt city was 
most populous. During the Persian period 
the Euphrates- occupied a new channel, thus 
producing the configuration known to Herodo- 
tus and Ctesias. The English publishers have 
included all the illustrations of the German 
volume. But they have used thicker and less 
highly calendered paper, so that the copious 
half-tone plates have lost decidedly in bril- 
liance. A reduction in size of page has neces- 
sitated folding the colored plate fig. 64, which 
has also been interchanged with fig. 80. The 
worst feature of the English volume is the 
fragile binding, which gives way upon first 
opening the book. On the other hand, one is 
glad to note the addition of running title and

index. The thirteen years' accomplishments 
summarized in "The Excavations at Baby- 
lon" represent about one half of the total 
task. Accounts of further progress are avail- 
able in German only, in the bulletins of the 
Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft. Even now the 
work continues, for in spite of the war Dr. 
Koldewey returned last November to his field. 
Whether the excavation of the city is ever to 
be finished can not now be foretold. Until 
that consummation is attained, the present 
volume will be indispensable to those who seek 
acquaintance with ancient Babylon. 



In the poetic opera, "Fairyland" 
A successful (y j University Press), Mr. 

American opera. JL . TT . - ' . ' ' 

Brian Hooker has given us an 
alluring text which demands at every point of 
its development a musical setting. If the book 
had not been written so that Mr. Horatio W. 
Parker might illuminate it with his mature 
and effective art, it would have solicited infal- 
libly the services of some other musician to 
accomplish what has been done by the master 
of orchestral investiture at Yale College. The 
fairyland presented in this drama is not the 
Shakespearean forest of the "Midsummer 
Night's Dream." Titania and Oberon have no 
part in it. The story and significance connect 
themselves more directly with Maeterlinck and 
his remarkable plays. There is the old anti- 
thesis of ecclesiastical domination on the one 
side and governmental tyranny on the other; 
between these two, human life is crushed as 
between the upper and nether millstones. 
Liberation is brought about through the eleva- 
tion of the great body of mankind, and the 
normal happiness of ennobled daily life is set 
above all artificial and oppressive distinctions. 
This theme is presented in a well conceived 
form, picturesque, simple, interesting. Mr. 
Hooker's " Fairyland " is the realm of human 
nature's daily experiences, in the regular proc- 
esses of the diurnal round, sincerely pursued 
for ends that are beneficent and purifying, the 
completeness of love and sacrifice. This does 
not mean that the book is a moral allegory. 
The sensuous appeal is there, the story and the 
pictures are sufficient, the characters awaken 
admiration and comment, the poetry is melo- 
dious, and the echoes of internal meaning sur- 
round it with a rich and luminous atmosphere. 
We have not had as yet the opportunity of see- 
ing the score, but the play seems well adapted 
to the general tendencies of Mr. Parker's work ; 
and this opera, the second by the same author 
and composer to win a notable prize, ought to 
find audiences that will rejoice in its romantic 
color and movement. If here is an exemplifi- 
cation of what America is to do in musical 



drama, we may look forward hopefully to the 
evolution of an art that will not need to hide 
its diminished head before the achievements of 
other lands and times. 



Even the most unemotional of 

A posthumous . . , 

volume by reviewers must admit that with 

Sister Nivedita. some ^QQ^ sympathy is the only 

exegete; and in Sister Nivedita's "Footfalls 
of Indian History" (Longmans) we have a 
striking instance. One cannot fail to note in 
the volume many out-and-out mistakes, and a 
still greater number of controverted points as- 
sumed as unquestioned truths ; yet one leaves 
the volume with the feeling that this gifted 
Irish woman, who became such a thorough- 
going convert to Hinduism, has given us gener- 
ous fare. At the same time it is difficult to 
say just what group of readers would care for 
the book as a whole. To most people a stronger 
appeal will be made by such papers as "A 
Study of Benares " and " The History of India 
and Its Study " than by the chapters on " The 
Ancient Abbey of Ajanta " or " The Cities of 
Buddhism"; but the latter type represents 
the genuinely valuable work of the author. 
Naturally, one must always make allowance 
for her preconceptions that Hinduism is trans- 
cendentally noble and that there is a national 
unity of India ; but when this has been done, 
the reader will find that her work is careful 
and conscientious, and based on a serious study 
alike of the monuments and of the standard 
authorities. The volume is illustrated by ex- 
cellent photographs and plans, as well as by 
six colored plates of real merit, reproducing 
water-colors from the brushes of Gaganendra 
Nath Tagore and Nanda Lai Bose. Inasmuch 
as Miss Noble's books are gradually reaching 
a wider circle, it would seem that the volume 
might have given us a brief account of her 
life and writings, and of her death some four 
years ago. In itself this would make most 
interesting reading, as well as being a real 
convenience for such readers as are gaining 
their first acquaintance with this remarkable 
woman. 

In a disinterested effort to save 
at least a little Latin from the 
engulfing flood of anti-classic- 
ism, Mr. E. Parmalee Prentice, who will be 
remembered for his prominence in the Am- 
herst movement against undue intrusion of the 
sciences into the field of academic culture, has 
followed up his last year's publication of 
Ruskin's "The King of the Golden River," in 
Dr. Arcadius Avellanus's Latin translation, 
with a second book of diverting fiction in the 
same tongue and from the same translator. 
This time choice has been made of the learned 



Modern fiction 
in Latin dress.

David-Leon Cahun's story of ancient mari- 
time adventure which bears, in the original, 
the following descriptive title: "Les aven- 
tures du Capitaine Magon, ou une exploration 
phenicienne mille ans avant 1'ere chretienne." 
In its classical dress, under the title, ' ' Pericla 
Navarchi Magonis," the work forms the first 
volume of a courageously projected series, 
"Mount Hope Classics," issued, says Mr. 
Prentice, primarily for his own children, but 
very gladly furnished by him to such pur- 
chasers as may take an interest in his laudable 
and by no means lucrative enterprise. The 
Latin is not exactly Ciceronian, but none the 
less serviceable for that reason, and perhaps 
even more readily intelligible; certainly it is 
not difficult, and the sensation of finding one- 
self actually drawn along, page after page, by 
the interest of the narrative will be novel to 
more than one who, in his time, has been 
moved to sighs and groans by the elegant 
Tully's formidable periods. Captain Mago's 
stirring adventures fill more than three hun- 
dred octavo pages, and are followed by twenty 
pages of author's and translator's notes, which 
need not, however, halt the progress of the 
reader enraptured with the brisk movement of 
the tale. A natural query will be prompted by 
the announcement on the title-page: "Opus 
Francice scripsit Leo Cahun, in Anglicum 
vertit Helena E. Frewer, Latine interpretatus 
est Arcadius Avellanus. ' ' Is the present ver- 
sion based on the English translation? If so, 
why? Surely there is no apparent reason for 
so circuitous a proceeding. Mr. Prentice's 
address is 37 Wall Street, New York. 



4 plea for -^ or tne ^ me being, Mr. Reginald 

Belgium by Wright Kauffman has aban- 
' ne88 - doned fiction, finding in the situ- 
ation of affairs in Belgium matter stranger 
than any novelist would dare venture to de- 
pict. "In a Moment of Time" (Moffat) is a 
plea for a people outraged, dispossessed, and 
slaughtered by the wickedest war waged in 
historic time. The author dedicates the profits 
from his book to funds for the amelioration 
(so far as irremediable wrongs can be bet- 
tered) of the situation he found there. This 
situation is described in such details as will 
bear printing, with suggestions of horror sur- 
passing the power of the pen looming ghastly 
in the background. Mr. Kauffman sums up his 
plea in a few vivid words : " Charity has no 
nationality and knows none. It is not a prod- 
uct of justice; it is justice. To stand with 
folded hands and watch another nation starve : 
that is not neutrality ; it is the last refinement 
of enmity. The duty of America, we have been 
told, is to be neutral ; then the duty of America 



is charity." Incidentally, by every dictate of 
civilization, the conquerors should be feeding 
the people they have disinherited. In making 
its contribution to these victims, America finds 
itself paying tribute to ruthlessness. It has to 
be done and it must be done, but it is not to 
be expected that America should forego its 
intelligence and not set the blame where it has 
been so devilishly earned. There are repro- 
duced photographs to support the text, but it 
needs no support. As we read we know that 
the fact is worse than the tale itself, and we 
bow our heads in shame at man's inhumanity 
to man. 

An Englishman's Considerably more than his own 
adventures fair share of unusual and some- 
on land and sea. ^ mes ex citing experiences seems 
to have fallen to the lot of Mr. Stanley Coxon, 
author of an anecdotal autobiography entitled 
"And That Reminds Me" (Lane), which 
shows us the writer encircling the globe eight 
times in sailing ships, continuing his mari- 
time activities under the swifter propulsion 
of steam, entering the government service as 
assistant district superintendent of police in 
Burma, where he helped to make a success of 
Prince Albert Victor's visit to that part of 
the British Empire, then returning home on 
sick furlough, next appointed to various posi- 
tions in India, and finally invalided from the 
service and left with sufficient leisure on his 
hands to write (with no thought of publica- 
tion, he assures us) the present story of his 
eventful life. Between times he has found it 
possible to engage in divers sorts of perilous 
undertakings and adventures, including matri- 
mony, and it is his partner in the last-named 
desperate deed who has persuaded him to 
make full confession of his dubious doings 
we borrow his own playful style without as- 
suming responsibility for any false inferences 
therefrom in order that she at least may 
have some adequate knowledge of his "awful 
past." Our thanks therefore are due pri- 
marily to Mrs. Coxon, and secondarily to the 
author, for what, in the frankly colloquial 
idiom of the book, may truthfully be called a 
rattling good story. Two score illustrations, 
and an additional one to make us acquainted 
with the writer's outward form and feature, 
embellish this diverting volume. 



Life in 
America a 
century ago. 



To the works upon the social 
history of our forebears, repre- 
sented by such books as those of 
Edward Eggleston, John Fiske, Alice Morse 
Earle, Sydney George Fisher, and others, a 
volume of great charm has been added by 
Dr. Gaillard Hunt, Chief of the Division of 
Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, in the

THE DIAL 



[ April 29 



book entitled " Life in America One Hundred 
Years Ago" (Harper). In his preface, Dr. 
Hunt sadly contrasts the origin of his book, 
a suggestion of the Committee of One Hun- 
dred to celebrate at the City of Washington 
one hundred years of peace between Great 
Britain and the United States, and the war 
now raging in Europe. The volume op ens with \ 
the story of the Peace of which the news came 
to Washington in 1815. The country and its I 
inhabitants, their ways and habits (viewed 
both from their own standpoint and through 
the eyes of foreign visitors), slavery, travel, 
dress, women, the theatre, music, religion, edu- 
cation, crime, poverty, medicine, cooking, 
these and similar topics Dr. Hunt, with ever 
delicate touch, passes in review. At the close, 
he turns to the political organization and to 
the problems which confronted the still young 
experiment of a democratic-republican federal 
state. The book is well illustrated, and is 
blessed with an index and a bibliography, in 
the latter of which, however, the proof-reading 
has left something to be desired. Throughout 
the body of the work the personal element is 
large, and is accompanied with frequent reve- 
lations of the quiet humor of the author. 
Many social historians write con amore, but 
with little critical skill ; the careful historians, 
alas, are often dull. It is Dr. Hunt's privilege 
to write both as a scholar and as one to the 

manner born.

about San Francisco are por- 
trayed by a true nature-lover's pen in Mr. 
W. E. Hutchinson's "By-ways around San 
Francisco Bay" (Abingdon Press). In this 
new land with its beautiful bay of a thousand 
moods, framed in sunlit hills of the Berkeley 
shore and distant Marin, dominated by the 
purpling slopes of Mount Tamalpais, and ever 
and anon wreathed in tumbling billows of fog, 
our author has caught his inspiration ; and in 
a few graceful lines he guides the spirit, rather 
than the feet, to the secrets of hill and valley, 
of field and forest, of brookside and ocean 
shore. Mr. Hutchinson knows the land he 
loves, and he gives us a glimpse of the joys he 
has found in exploring afoot and afield with 
rod and camera in the great out-of-doors which 
lies about the Golden Gate. Quaint bits of old 
Chinatown, the lateen sails of Fisherman's 
Wharf where swarthy Neapolitans foregather 
and where Robert Louis Stevenson was wont 
to seek inspiration, these and other gleams 
of local color are touched upon lightly but 
revealingly by the author. Lovers of nature 
will find this booklet a choice introduction to 
the picturesque about San Francisco.

A PERSONAL OPINION of 

The Yale Review 

' 'It is the equal of the best English quarterlies 
and continues to grow better with each issue, and 
the greatest literary enjoyment any man could 
desire would be that the Review be a monthly 
instead of a quarterly." 

Other readers, though perhaps none more 
gracefully, have requested more frequent publica- 
tion of The Yale Review. We believe, however, 
that as a rule the modern reader of periodical 
literature wants on the one hand frequent discus- 
sions of current events and books, and on the 
other, longer articles of a more reflective sort, 
published not too frequently. The next issues of 
the reading we wish to linger over should not come 
upon us too rapidly, and the articles they contain 
should be especially worth-while, with a freshness 
and significance especially long-lived. 

The Yale Re<vienv is designed for those thou- 
sands of intelligent readers who desire to under- 
stand as fully as may be the scope and significance 
of the burning questions of to-day and who wish 
at the same time to enjoy articles of permanent 
literary character. Its nearly one thousand annual 
pages are assembled in four numbers, printed in 
large attractive type OP imported Esparto feather- 
weight paper. The subscription price is $2. 50 a year. 

A specimen copy, a 1915 prospectus and a synopsis of 
the current (April) contents will gladly be sent upon 
the request of prospective friends and readers of 

THE YALE REVIEW, New Haven, Conn.

Miss Viola Rosehoro', to whom is credited the 
discovery of O. Henry and the acceptance of his 
first work, is now associated withTHE EDITOR , 
the fortnightly journal of information for literary 
workers, as critic and adviser. In his autobiogra- 
phy S. S. McClure says : "Miss Roseboro' seized 
upon the early stories of O. Henry, Jack London, 
Myra Kelly, Rex Beach and on the Emmy Lou 
stories with as much sureness of conviction as if 
she had known what the end was to be in each 
case, and exactly how popular each of these writers 
was to become." 

In return for moderate fees writers may have the 
benefit of Miss Roseboro's personal criticism of 
their manuscripts. 

Writers who wish a handy, complete, up-to-date 
directory to the markets for their manuscripts 
should have the new edition of 

"1,001 Places to Sell Manuscripts' 

(The American Writer's Year Book and Directory) 

which lists in classes, with indexes, cross-indexes 
and definite statements of the kinds of material in 
demand in each market, more than 5,000 pur- 
chasers of short stories, novels, essays, poems, 
articles, plays, vaudeville material, photoplays, 
jokes, photographs, post card sentiments, para- 
graphs, etc. If there are markets for a writer's 
manuscripts they are made available in this guide.

JOHN DEWEY

WILLIAM ENGLISH 
WALLING 

Author of 
"Socialism As It Is," etc. 



GERMAN PHILOSOPHY AND 
POLITICS 

Gives the unprofessional reader a succinct notion of the 
development of classic German philosophy from Kant to 
Hegel. 

Incidentally this book shows how German thought took 
shape in the struggle for German nationality against the 
Napoleonic menace, and how profoundly that crisis 
affected the philosophy of morals. It also makes clear how 
superficial is the current accounting for the contemporary at- 
titude of intellectual Germany by reference to Nietzsche, etc. 

Ready in May. Probable price, $1.25 net. 

THE SOCIALISTS AND THE WAR 

"The Red Book" would have served as a title for this 
book had not Austria pre-empted it, as three-fourths of it 
consists of documentary statements of Socialists of all 
Countries toward the war, with special reference to their 
peace policy. Mr. Walling's running editorial comment sets 
forth the conditions under which the Socialist statements were 
made and indicates why they are important. 

Ready in May. Probable price, $1.50 net. 



LOUIS T. MOORE

LIMITATIONS OF SCIENCE

[May 13 



Every Reader of the Dial 

Should Be Particularly Interested 
in Walter Elwood's Fine Novel 

Guimo 

If you happen to be one of those readers for 
whom this book is intended, if it grips you in the 
right way, then you will welcome it as nothing 
more nor less than a great adventure. 

Frederic Taker Cooper in The Bookman. 

The lively interest of the tale is one of the least 
of its merits. Far more important is the marvel- 
ous delineation of Guimo and almost equally val- 
uable is the panorama of the islands which unfolds 
before the reader under the magic of the story. 
Guimo is one of the most haunting characters of 
recent fiction, and only Kipling has made the 
Orient live more vividly than this author has done. 

Chicago Journal. 

Guimo is one of those books that, like the four- 
leafed clover, fills the finder with glee or secret 
joy. Both for infinite variety and quality of pris- 
tine purity this romance will live long in the minds 
of literary fiction lovers. Philadelphia Record.

CARRANZA 
and MEXICO 

By CARLO DE FORNARO 

A Graphic Portrayal of Mexico's 
New Leader 

"If the European war had not come along 
and swamped the headlines, Carlo de Fornaro's 
'Carranza and Mexico' would be one of the sensa- 
tions of the year. Even so, it is a story of vast 
interest to those who would learn the truth con- 
cerning the Mexican situation from a man who 
has supremely mastered it. The reading of it will 
give a vivid and intensely clear, if one-sided, 
view of the Mexican situation to date." 

Evening Sun, Ne-iv York 

"A very important contribution to a proper 
understanding of the torn, confused, chaotic con- 
dition of political affairs in Mexico to-day."

In "A FAR COUNTRY" Mr. Winston 
Churchill has written a novel that will

Mr. Churchill turns to another of our

THE PRESENT GENERATION. 

Every man of middle age must have looked 
back to the days of his youth and speculated a 
little on how different things were then ; there 
comes a time in the life of everyone when he 
realizes that he is no longer young and that the 
present generation is somehow different from 
the generation of his youth. Just what this 
difference is, is rarely obvious. It is no more 
obvious to-day than at other times. 

For myself, I am of necessity given to rather 
academic studies, and I often join such 
thoughts to speculations concerning the turn 
of the century that rise from a study of En- 
glish Literature. There we have, as has often 
been noted, the great age of Elizabeth, a period 
of freedom, and the great age of Anne, a 
period of discipline. The mind naturally runs 
on to the romantic period, about 1800, where 
again it was the time of liberty and imagina- 
tion and ideas; and then says, How about 
1900 ? "Was that to be a second period of dis- 
cipline, of correctness, of restraint? Has it 
been, is it such? 

Certainly we can hardly expect the regular 
recurrence of expansion and contraction, of 
systole and diastole, as my honored old teacher 
Professor Corson used to like to say. Even if 
it were a regular heart beating, or a pendulum 
swinging, we should hardly expect that; for 
though it might have come regularly in 1600, 
1700, 1800, there has been such disturbance 
of conditions that we could hardly expect just 
the same ebb and flow, or flow and ebb, coming 
to its point in 1900. Not to mention the great 
Victorian age, which perhaps was no greater 
interruption to the regularity of ideas than the 
Puritan revolution in the seventeenth century 
or the romantic revival in the eighteenth, 
there were other new conditions especially 
affecting letters. The utilitarian turn of the 
Victorian age was certainly making for an age 
of restraint, and indeed had made it, only 
sooner than one might have expected. No time 
has been so dead to anything that the Eliza- 
bethans or the romanticists would recognize as 
the time about 1880. The period of repression 
had come sooner, that was all, induced prob- 
ably by the immense increase of the read-

ing and writing public that came about from 
the mechanical advances in printing and the 
other arts that go to the making of books. 
I should say that the older generation the 
generation which came to maturity about '75, 
'80, or '85 showed not restraint but repres- 
sion to a considerable degree. It did nothing 
in poetry; to write ballades, villanelles, ron- 
deaus, rondels, triolets was its highest achieve- 
ment. It did something in prose ; but it was 
the prose of observation and document, the 
prose of Defoe two hundred years before, but 
generally without his genius. It was pretty 
hopeless in religion (here in America, at least) , 
and pretty hopeless in politics. Much may be 
learned from the attitude of the young. Thou- 
sands of men now getting on in middle life 
were then in college; they can say whether 
what was then called " Harvard indifference " 
was confined to Harvard. 

We need not fancy that 1900 was to have 
been another 1700. It very clearly was not. 
Whoever looked in 1900 for a modern Pope, a 
modern Addison, a modern Defoe, a modern 
Locke, would have been sadly disappointed. 
Rudyard Kipling and Bernard Shaw, Henri 
Bergson and William James, John Sargent 
and Claude Monet, Anatole France and Mau- 
rice Maeterlinck did not point in that direc- 
tion. It may not be clear just whither they* 
did point ; but it was not toward Law, as com- 
monly understood. Science and Logic and 
Realism had come to their zenith some years 
before. 

If we look back to those days thirty or forty 
years ago we who can remember them we 
shall feel instinctively that times were very 
different. And the difference will not be the 
usual difference between youth and middle 
age. It is not that we were then fresh, enthusi- 
astic, free, and that now we are confined, toned 
down, limited. That is the way one would 
expect an older man to look back to the days 
of his youth. But I will wager that with any 
man who has kept up with the times, the feel- 
ing is just the reverse, he will feel that in 
those days he was confined and had no chance 
to live or think, and that it is in these days 
that one is more free to do something. 

Take a few of the movements of the time 
that especially concern young men and young 
women. We might at the very first say that it 
is something that such things should now con- 
cern young women as well as young men ; but 
take that for granted. It was in 1888 that the 



Student Volunteer Movement was begun ; that 
is a type, only, of a movement for active relig- 
ion a hundred-fold greater. It was the indi- 
rect outcome, of course, of earlier influences, 
such as the preaching of Moody ; but the full 
fruition of Moody's work was slow. The 
Northfield Conference, the Student Volun- 
teers, the Christian Endeavorers, and many 
other forms of awakened Christianity, came in 
the last generation. 

In politics the change is equally marked. 
The recollections of any political worker of 
middle age, the life of any politician, should 
show that much. As I look back to my college 
days, I feel sure that the temptation to the 
young man to get out into political work was 
very slight. I often used to think of it: it* 
seemed as if the great causes had all been set- 
tled; civil service reform and the mugwump 
movement were almost the only things. Doubt- 
less there was far more than I saw in those- 
days, but I believe the main idea is correct. 

So also with social service. Charles Brace's; 
" The Dangerous Classes of New York " and 
Charles Booth's " Labor and Life in East 
London " were early and important books, and 
General Booth's Christian Mission as well as 
the Five-Points Mission in New York pointed 
a way. But the new era only began with 
Toynbee Hall in 1885 and Hull House in 1889. 
Social service to-day is a wholly different thing; 
from the philanthropy of 1880. 

This deals chiefly with America alone. I 
have not the broad outlook that could include 
the world ; but certainly the words Modernism; 
in religion, Socialism in politics, Social Ser- 
vice in philanthropy, seem to show much the 
same thing. In one case we can be more exact. 
In France a few years ago they were much 
impressed with just this interest of which I 
now speak, and a number of inquiries were 
made as to the difference in the thought of the 
young men of France in our own day and the 
young men of a generation ago. Of these in- 
quiries the one published under the name of 
"Agathon " was most widely known, and in 
spite of some adverse criticism its general 
tenor may probably be accepted as accurate. 
Agathon looks back to the eighties, and views 
the generation for which Paul Bourget wrote 
his " Psychologic Contemporaine." There are 
perhaps among those who read these lines some 
who remember those brilliant essays when they 
came out, those remarkable studies of the mas- 
ters of modern France, Taine, Renan, Bau- 



1915] 



THE DIAL

delaire. Agathon sees the generation of young 
France which came to manhood in the years 
following the war of '70-'71 to have been 
materialistic, sceptical, dilettante. Very dif- 
ferent the France of to-day, as Agathon por- 
trayed it and as the war found it, very 
different in religion, in politics, and in the life 
of service. 

We cannot be far wrong if we believe that 
the new century found the human spirit 
straining to get forward rather than holding 
back, looking out and not in, bent on action 
rather than doubting as to truth. So much 
probably would be news to few. 

Farther it might be hard to go. Was 1900 
merely looking to a repetition of 1800 or 1600, 
a repetition coming faster than might have 
been anticipated because ideas get about faster 
than they used and so men live faster than 
they used? Can we take the torch of Shake- 
speare and Bacon and Spenser, of Wordsworth 
and Byron and Shelley, and carry it farther ? 
Can we indeed (to drop the figure) even read 
Shakespeare and Wordsworth to-day and feel 
that they have anything to say to the modern 
man? Certain men of modern minds would 
doubtless say no. 

I would not discuss that. I would gladly, 
however, point out one new idea in the pres- 
ent course of events which may prove to be a 
general leaven to the life of our time. I have 
spoken of religion, politics, and social service ; 
now there is a word to be said of literature. 
The literature of the last generation has 
offered a curious commingling of the effort to 
see the environment of the life about us just 
as it is (which is sometimes called realism) and 
the effort to realize some other kind of life 
which we instinctively feel is better, which is 
sometimes called romance and sometimes ideal- 
ism and sometimes other things. Everyone 
will recognize this in the fiction of the last 
thirty years and in the drama. It may be seen 
also in poetry. Toward the end of the eighties 
appeared the work of Henley and of Yeats; 
in the nineties were Davidson and Phillips ; in 
the first years of our century came John Mase- 
field and Alfred Noyes. The first thing one 
would say about Henley, Davidson, Masefield 
(or at least the first thing that people did say) 
is, Here is realism. And of Yeats, Phillips, 
Noyes, we should say, Here is romance. Yet 
as soon as we begin to read either set we find 
that such a ticketing is not of much use. Each 
one may have his especial leading, but Henley, 



in spite of his " Hospital Sketches " and 
" London Voluntaries," is certainly romantic 
enough ; and Yeats, in spite of his wanderings 
with Oisin and Niamh, in spite of his old 
Celtic romance or his modern magic, keeps 
pretty well in touch with the plain every-day 
life of the modern Irish peasant. And so with 
the others ; there are preferences but there is 
not that sharp distinction between life as we 
know it and life as we wish it might be. 

There is a passage in Scott's " Waverley " 
that is very typical of its time, almost exactly 
a century ago. Toward the end of the book it 
is written of Waverley, left behind on the re- 
treat from Derby, that " he felt himself enti- 
tled to say firmly, though perhaps with a sigh, 
that the romance of his life was ended, and 
that its real history had commenced." 

But nobody believes in any such sharp con- 
trast now. The whole idea of modern religion, 
modern politics, modern social service is that 
one must go into them with such conviction, 
such enthusiasm, such life that their crudest 
realities fuse into a true romance. In fact, 
neo-realism and neo-romance are the same 
thing ; which is the reason why it is so hard to 
classify (in the old classification) people like 
Rudyard Kipling and Bernard Shaw. 

Of these two typical men I will merely offer 
two sayings which (to my mind) provide an 
explanation of the modern movement. Of Kip- 
ling we have an evidence, not from his own 
writing but from that of another, as to what 
he was to the rising generation. " He pro- 
vided phrases for just that desire for discipline 
and devotion." There is more in " The New 
Machiavelli," but that expresses what I see in 
Kipling, discipline become devotion, or just 
the other way if you will. That gets the two 
things together somehow, liberty and law; it 
fuses them. Of Bernard Shaw I will merely 
quote a chance expression, but a true one for 
all that. " Virtue," says he, " consists not in 
abstaining from vice, but in not desiring it." 
I don't know where he says it; but I would 
trust Dr. Archibald Henderson, from whom I 
quote it, on more than that. 

I have written so much already that I can- 
not now develop this idea into all its ramifica- 
tions in the life of our time. Perhaps some

For the moment it must be enough to say that 
the whole strength of the religious movements 
of the past generation lies in its emphasis on 
the power of Christ to-day to bring the human

will into harmony with himself and the pur- 
poses of God ; that the essence of modern poli- 
tics is that no system and no legislation im- 
posed from without can ever make our public 
life what it should be, but that reform must be 
renaissance and come from within, must begin 
with the individual citizen ; and that the heart 
of the social movement lies not in a sort of 
Lady Bountiful helping the poor, but in so 
much fellow-feeling with those who need help 
that one realizes that the needs and wants of 
one are needs and wants of all. The aim is 
(as it has always been) sincerity: the only 
way to make men good is to make them long 
to be good.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE LOST CLASSICS OF ANCIENT GREECE have 

for centuries been vaguely and longingly con- 
jectured to be awaiting disinterment whenever 
some conquering army of Christian Europe 
should recover Constantine's capital from the 
Moslem Turk. Hence the hopes of the learned 
world, perhaps even including the Teutonic 
world, in these days of reported naval and 
military activity in and about the Dardanelles 
and the Bosphorus. If at last the treasures of 
literature now supposed to be lurking in sun- 
dry crypts and lofts and mosque libraries of 
Constantinople shall be brought to light, what 
may they not include ? Even some of the best- 
known names in Greek poetry and drama are 
at present represented by but a small portion 
of the writings believed to have come from 
their respective authors' pens, ^Eschylus, 
known to us through seven cherished tragedies, 
is said to have written ten times that number ; 
Sophocles likewise survives in seven of his 
tragedies, while one hundred and thirty are 
ascribed to him ; and though the less-esteemed 
Euripides has come down to us in a score (less 
two) of his dramatic pieces, he exhibited plays 
for thirty-three years after first winning the 
grand prize in 441 B. c., and must have left 
behind him when he died in 406, at the age of 
seventy-five, a great many more than the 
eighteen extant tragedies bearing his name. 
Of other famous Greeks, known to the modern 
world by few of their works or by none at all, 
and thought to be awaiting a possible resurrec- 
tion when the day of doom shall dawn on the 
Turkish capital, there are, for example, Archi- 
lochus of Paros, Hipponax of Ephesus, Ana- 
creon and Sappho and Alcaeus, Stersichorus, 



Simonides of Amorgos, and that later Simon- 
ides, of Ceos, famous for his prize elegy on 
those who fell at Marathon, and for fifty-five 
other prize compositions; and Pindar, whose 
extant work is but a fragment, and Philetas of 
Cos, and Lycophron, and Callimachus, and 
Meleager, and who knows how many more. If 
all these should come into their own with the 
fall of Constantinople, what a renaissance of 
Greek literature would forever after be assor 
ciated with this the four hundred and sixty- 
second year after the taking of that city by 
the Ottomans! And if the recapture of the 
place from them should chance to fall on the 
twenty-ninth of this month for it was on 
May 29, 1453, that they took possession of the 
capital of the Eastern Empire what a mem- 
orable anniversary celebration that would be ! 



THE SHORT-STORY HARVEST OF 1914, so far 
as that harvest is garnered within the covers 
of eight leading American periodicals, has 
been winnowed and sifted by Mr. Edward J. 
O'Brien, who publishes the results of his self- 
imposed labor in the Boston " Transcript," in 
a form resembling that in which Mr. William 
Stanley Braithwaite has for some years been 
wont to present his findings in respect to the 
annual crop of magazine verse. Six hundred 
and one short stories were read by Mr. O'Brien, 
who pronounces 229 of them to be possessed 
of "distinction," and 86 marked by "very 
high distinction." Among those writers who 
have produced the best work in this depart- 
ment, according to Mr. O'Brien, are especially 
to be noted Mrs. Katharine Fullerton Gerould, 
Mr. Joseph Conrad, Mr. Melville Davisson 
Post, Mr. H. G. Dwight, Mr. James Hopper, 
Miss Elsie Singmaster, Mr. Francis Buzzell, 
Mr. John Luther Long, Mr. Conrad Richter, 
Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Mr. Gouver- 
neur Morris, Mr. Calvin Johnston, Mr. Armis- 
tead C. Gordon, Miss Mary Synon, Mrs. Edith 
Wharton, and Mr. John Galsworthy; and 
in his opinion the five best short stories of 
the year were, in the order of their merit, 
"Brothers of No Kin," by Mr. Richter (in 
"The Forum"), "Addie Erb and Her Girl 
Lottie," by Mr. Buzzell (in " The Century"), 
"A Simple Tale," by Mr. Galsworthy, " The 
Bravest Son," by Mary Synon, and " The Tri- 
umph of Night," by Mrs. Wharton (the three 
last-named in " Scribner's Magazine"). Mr. 
O'Brien's deductions and judgments are of 
undoubted interest; yet it is nevertheless 
probable that if ninety-nine other persons of 
equal critical capability were to present ap- 
praisals, based upon the same data, of the best 
short stories of the year, no two lists among 
the hundred would be found to correspond.

THE NEW HEAD OF THE JOHN CARTER BROWN 

LIBRARY, in succession to Mr. George Parker 
Winship, who goes to Harvard as librarian of 
the Harry Elkins Widener collection, is an- 
nounced to be Mr. Champlin Burrage, of the 
same stock as the Boston Burrages, though his 
present position as librarian of Manchester 
College, Oxford, may beget the erroneous in- 
ference that he is an Englishman. Portland, 
Maine, is his birthplace, Brown University his 
alma mater, and he is still on what may be 
called the upward slope of life, having been 
graduated from college as late as 1896. Two 
years of German university study, chiefly at 
Berlin, followed his graduation, and he has 
made a specialty of church history, particu- 
larly the history of the non-conformist move- 
ment in England, unearthing some important 
documents about Kobert Browne, founder of 
the Brownist sect, which later became known j 
as that of the Independents or Congregation- 
alists. Also new sources of knowledge relating 
to John Robinson, pastor of the Pilgrims in 
Holland, have been laid open by Mr. Burrage, 
who has published " The New Covenant Idea," 
" New Facts concerning Rev. John Robinson," 
and " The Early English Dissenters in the 
Light of Recent Research." He has taken the 
degree of bachelor of letters at Oxford, which 
has stood sponsor for his more important his- 
torical publications and has, through Profes- 
sor Firth and others, expressed its sense of his 
ability in research. A collector, for himself 
and others, and a bibliophile, as well as a stu- 
dent and writer, he comes to his new duties at 
Providence with ample equipment and every 
promise of success in continuing the useful- 
ness and the high repute of the famous his- 
torical library to which he is called. 


AN ADJUSTMENT OP COPYRIGHT DIFFERENCES 

between this country and England, as indeed 
between all the civilized nations of the earth, is 
one of the things to be hoped for and striven 
for in that better future to which mankind is 
ever looking eagerly forward. A recent step 
in the right direction has been taken by the 
British government in the issuance of an 
" order in council " not of a warlike com- 
plexion, but eminently pacificatory decree- 
ing that henceforth the unpublished literary, 
dramatic, musical, or artistic work of an Amer- 



ican author, playwright, composer, or artist 
shall enjoy the protection of British copyright 
equally with all such work of British origin. 
Thus the public performance of an American 
play in England will make its copyright there 
secure, without the publication heretofore re- 
quired for copyright purposes. Musical com- 
positions and art works will profit in like 
manner. All this should remind us, to our 
shame, that England has always been more 
liberal toward American authors in respect to 
copyright privileges than America has been 
toward English authors. Our absurd laws 
still require an. English author seeking Amer- 
ican copyright, to print his book in this coun- 
try from type set up or plates made in the 
United States, whereas England only asks for 
simultaneous publication in the two countries, 
with no silly specifications in regard to print- 
ing. In the realm of letters all things that 
savor of international jealousy or suspicion or 
unfriendliness are absurdly and lamentably 
out of place. 



ONE DAY'S ACTIVITIES IN A BUSY REFERENCE 
ROOM are too numerous and varied, and under 
too little supervision or control, to admit of 
anything like accurate record. Who can tell 
how many hundred different topics may be the 
subject of more or less thorough research at 
any one time, through the thousand or more 
general works of reference freely accessible to 
all comers in such public libraries as those of 
New York, Chicago, Cleveland, Boston, and 
St. Louis'? Within the working hours of one 
such literary laboratory, that at Brooklyn, the 
following subjects are " a few that came to the 
attention of the staff," as we learn from Mr. 
Calvin W. Foss, the reference librarian in 
charge of the department : "Assaying of dia- 
monds ; lubricating oils ; Platt Amendment to 
Act concerning Relations of United States 
with Cuba; criticisms of the writings of Seu- 
mas MacManus ; Norman influence on English 
literature; Franco-Spanish Treaty (1912) 
concerning Morocco; civil status of Ceuta, 
Morocco; Tissot paintings of Life of Christ; 
New York laws respecting Morgues ; foot and 
mouth disease; follicular mange; color pho- 
tography; laws governing charitable institu- 
tions of New York City; finger-ring design; 
Japanese embroidery; steam engineering; 
comparative value of clay lands in different 
states, and market prices of the clays ; archi- 
tecture and furnishings of colonial dining 
rooms." When it is borne in mind that on the 
following day as many more entirely different 
topics probably demanded investigation, and 
on the day after that still another list, and so

ble duplication of research, in the long- run, the 
practical usefulness of this part of a library's 
equipment becomes apparent. We need this 
reminder occasionally, in view of the unde- 
niable expense of this equipment. 

A POTENT POEM, the potency of which has 
shown itself in causing the withdrawal of 
Professor Kuno Meyer's candidacy for the ex- 
change professorship at Harvard next season, 
has enjoyed an unexpectedly wide publicity 
after its recent initial appearance in " The 
Harvard Advocate." Awarded by Dean Briggs 
and Professor Bliss Perry the prize offered by 
this student publication for the best poem on 
the European war, this piece of verse, from the 
pen of Mr. C. Huntington Jacobs, of the junior 
class, takes its place beside Hoffmann von 
Fallersleben's " Deutschland, Deutschland 
iiber Alles " as a generator of strife. It is 
entitled "Gott mit Uns," and is doubtless 
familiar to most readers by this time. That 
Euterpe or Polyhymnia or any other of the 
Muses should thus become involved with Mars 
in a quarrel so abhorrent, as one would sup- 
pose, to the Pierian Nine, must excite regret. 
The present incident, which has elicited an 
impassioned protest from our distinguished 
visitor, may perhaps serve a useful end in illus- 
trating how trivial a matter will evoke the 
most vehement demonstrations of wrath when 
the atmosphere is tense with such bitter ani- 
mosities as those of the present time. "We are 
living in a powder magazine, and must be 
careful with our matches. 


SECOND-HAND KNOWLEDGE OF BOOKS is very 
decidedly abundant, as compared with direct 
acquaintance. The hardest work in the world 
is to think independently ; therefore mankind 
in general is glad to be told what it ought to 
think about the great masters of literature, 
and what book-titles and other scraps of lit- 
erary information it ought to have at its 
tongue's end. Addison and Johnson, Mon- 
taigne and Yoltaire, Schiller and Goethe, 
Homer and Dante and even Shakespeare, are 
little more than names to many persons who 
have the reputation of being- well-read and 
perhaps actually think themselves to be so. 
This vague half -knowledge, or one-tenth- 
knowledge, however, is rarely made the object 
of deliberate commendation on the part of 
anyone whose opinion is of value. Yet some 
such praise seems to be bestowed by " The Bul- 
letin of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and 
Sciences " when in a recent well-deserved trib- 
ute to Professor Copeland of Harvard it says : 
"Many Harvard men owe their knowledge of 
eighteenth-century English, of Fielding and 



Smollett, of Goldsmith and Pope, directly to 
Mr. Copeland rather than to their readings in 
history or literature of that age." Might it not 
have been more complimentary to Professor 
Copeland, and also nearer the truth, to say 
that many Harvard men owe their knowledge 
of the authors named to their readings in those 
authors, prompted by their teacher, even more 
than to his personal instruction? Contact 
with a born educator does not convert the 
pupil into a sponge; he is rather fired with 
zeal for more positive intellectual activity than 
is implied in mere absorption. The assimila- 
tion of knowledge, like the assimilation of 
food, calls for a considerable amount of reac- 
tive energy. 



A DEFINITION OF GREAT LITERATURE, from Mr. 

Howells's pen, has gained considerable cur- 
rency of late, and its pithy brevity makes it 
worth committing to memory. It was after 
commending the unstudied effectiveness of 
Grant's style in his " Personal Memoirs " that 
he enunciated, in explanation of the book's 
recognized claim to greatness, the truth that 
" great literature is nothing more nor less than 
the clear expression of minds that have some- 
thing great in them, whether religion, or 
beauty, or deep experience." This helps to 
explain why, as Leslie Stephen was wont to 
affirm, the best biography is that which ap- 
proaches the nearest to autobiography ; and it 
was with some such truth in mind that Edward 
Rowland Sill used to declare the only thing a 
man was really competent to write about was 
himself. Hence, too, as has been more than 
once pointed out, the truly great novel is, in 
essentials, autobiographical, though it is by no 
means necessary that it should be written in 
the first person, and it does not at all follow 
that every work of fiction presented as auto- 
biography is possessed of greatness. Those 
novelists who hope to impart an otherwise un- 
attainable virtue to their productions by mak- 
ing them autobiographic in form, but not in 
substance, may deceive themselves, though 
they will never deceive a discerning reader. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

A SPURIOUS DERIVATION ATTRIBUTED 

TO LA SALLE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A story was set afloat some years ago concerning 
the derivation of the name of Chicago, which in the 
first instance was intended without doubt as a 
humorous sally by its originator. But as in at 
least two instances, it has deceived recent writers, 
who seem to have regarded it as authentic, it would 
appear to be necessary to examine the matter 
seriously. 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



371 



In Edwin 0. Gale's " Reminiscences of Early 
Chicago," published in 1902, there was printed 
what purported to be a letter by the explorer La 
Salle, said to have been written in 1682 from the j 
present site of Chicago, " to a friend in France." 
In this letter (as printed) La Salle describes the 
river, flowing into the lake with a feeble current, 
" which occupies the course that formerly the 
waters of these great lakes took as they flowed 
southward to the Mississippi river." La Salle is 
made to say in this letter that " the boundless 
regions of the West must send their products to the 
East through this point. This will be the gate of 
empire, this the seat of commerce," a truly 
remarkable prediction if he ever wrote it as alleged. 
" If I were to give this place a name," he continues, 
tl I would derive it from the nature of the place and 
the nature of the man who will occupy this place 
ago, I act; circum, all around; Circago." Gale 
comments as follows on this extraordinary deri- 
vation : " The recollections of this statement, 
imparted to an Indian chief, remained but indis- 
tinctly, and when the Americans who built Fort 
Dearborn came to these wilds they heard what they 
thought to be the legendary name of the place and 
pronounced it as did the Indians, Che-ca-go, instead 
of Circago as La Salle had named it." 

Gale was an inveterate joker, as anyone will read- 
ily perceive who reads his book; but his recollec- 
tions have a real value to the historical student 
notwithstanding the author's humorous proclivities, 
for he came at a very early time, having arrived 
with his parents at Chicago in 1835. Now this 
so-called letter of La Salle's was given a place in 
Gale's book apparently for a humorous purpose 
and nothing else. It is a surprising fact, however, 
that the letter has been taken quite seriously by 
later writers. In a volume entitled " Chicago, Past 
and Present," by S. R. Winehell, published in 1906 
(four years after the appearance of Gale's book), 
there is quoted the La Salle letter together with 
Gale's comments, as if with the author's approval 
of its authenticity. Likewise in the " City Manual 
of 1914," issued by the Chicago Bureau of Statis- 
tics, the letter is quoted on the reverse of the title- 
page, occupying the page by itself, apparently with 
the approval of the compiler. 

It is interesting to observe, however, that at least 
one writer was not deceived by the letter thus 
appearing for the first time in Gale's book. Mr. 
John F. Steward, in his work entitled " Lost Mara- 
mech and Earliest Chicago," published in 1903, 
notices the publication of the letter, and remarks: 
" I do not find anything like this in any of the 
writings of La Salle, and I believe that I have a 
copy of every scratch of La Salle's pen that did 
not perish with him." Other writers, however, 
have regarded the letter as a joke, which it undoubt- 
edly is and was intended to be, and have made no 
references to it whatever. 

One would have supposed that the general con- 
tents and style of the letter would have furnished 
sufficient evidence of its spurious character. The 
description of the region, for example, where the 
" course that formerly the waters of these great 
lakes took as they flowed southward to the Missis- 
sippi river/' is mentioned, could only have been 



based on knowledge that neither La Salle nor any 
of his contemporaries possessed, for such knowl- 
edge has been arrived at only by means of investi- 
gations into glacial action by scientific men within 
the last two generations. In regard to the sounding 
phrase that " this will be the gate of empire, this 
the seat of commerce," it is impossible to believe 
that La Salle ever used the language quoted, as it 
is foreign to his! own style and that of other writers 
of the time. 

Ingenious derivations of place names have been 
a favorite sort of humor in times past,! mostly con- 
fined to newspaper paragraphs; and persons hav- 
ing a taste for fantastic notions of the kind, often 
said by their inventors to be derived from tales of 
trappers or Indians, find immense enjoyment in 
their repetition. But this is probably the first 
instance where it has become necessary to enter a 
solemn refutation of nonsense of this character. 
However, if jokes must be labelled, let it be done in 
this case ; or, better still, let such trifling be excluded 
from text-books and manuals having a serious pur- 
pose in view. j. SEYMOUR CUERBT.

THE FALLACIES OF " PEACE INSUEANCE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Permit me to call your attention to some errors 
in your review of my book, " Peace Insurance," in 
your issue of April 15. 

You state that my volume " offers no explanation 
as to why Europe, which has long carried very 
heavy insurance of this sort [armament], has now 
so destructive a war upon its hands." While it is 
true that I did not attempt to cover the intricate 
and controversial causes of the war, I did explain 
the causes in general in some detail. Permit me to 
invite your attention to pages 4 and 5, and to quote 
therefrom, in part : 

" It is thus that military force, insuring against 
defeat in war, insures against any war at all. . . . 
We insure against loss by fire, theft, burglary, etc. 
... In addition we attempt to prevent loss by fire 
departments, police departments, etc. These forces, it 
is needless to say, do not prevent fires, nor crimes, but 
they lessen their frequency and afford the BEST 
MEANS OF PROTECTION YET KNOWN. Mili- 
tary force bears the same relation to conflicts between 
nations." 

The above is but a summary. In the book it is 
substantiated at some length. Your statement that 
I offer no explanation is, therefore, incorrect. 

It is also stated in your review that the fact 
" that the victorious Confederate army at Bull Run 
also consisted of volunteers seems to have escaped 
the writer's notice," this being a result of my 
claim that with an army of trained troops, instead 
of a mob of civilians, the North would have gained 
a decisive victory and probably ended the war. 
I hope that you do not always reason so lightly. 
It may be remarked that when armies meet in bat- 
tle, even with both sides untrained, it is not infre- 
quent for one side or the other to be victorious. 
However, when a trained army meets an untrained 
army of equal size, it is seldom that the untrained 
one wins. It was this fact which did come to my 
notice, and which caused me to say that a trained 
army on the side of the North would have changed 



372 



THE DIAL 



[ May 13 



the result and ended the war. Had the South a 
trained army I could not have made such a state- 
ment. Furthermore, on page 153 of my book you 
will find actual comment on the condition of the 
Confederate force. Hence your statement in this 
respect is also incorrect. 

Your closing sentences state that the anti-mili- 
tarist sees things as they ought to be and can be, 
while the militarist sees things as they were in the 
past alone. However, in " Peace Insurance," 
while a very proper advantage is taken of the 
lessons of the past, two complete chapters are 
taken up with a study of the present and the 
future, namely, the chapters on " The Likeli- 
hood of War To-day" and "Will War Ever Be 
Abolished ? " The fact is that my book does con- 
sider things as they are, and as they probably will 
be according to all natural laws ; while the pacifists 
confuse these facts with theory and things as they 
ought to be, but in our time cannot be. 

Of course, in my attempt to present the case for 
the so-called military party, I have failed to do it 
justice in many respects. In that respect the book 
is weak, and it contains the errors common to all 
such publications. Nevertheless, I have been grati- 
fied to note that in their adverse criticism, the 
pacifists, among whom your reviewer must be num- 
bered, are apparently compelled to evade the mat- 
ters considered, to misstate matters, or to select 
trivial errors which reflect only on the author and 
in no way on the correctness of his thesis. 

Your attention is invited especially to pages 157 
and 158 of my book. It is to be hoped that you 
will be fair enough to correct your misstatements.

[While we are glad to give space to the 
above, we do not consider that it impugns the 
validity of our reviewer's statements at any 
point. The quoted paragraph can scarcely be 
regarded as a satisfactory explanation of the 
break-down of the author's theory in the case 
of the present war. Nor is the analogy with 
insurance against fire, theft, etc., an accurate 
one. The function of our police departments 
is to detect and suppress crime ; the function 
of our fire departments is to extinguish con- 
flagrations. The function of an armed mili- 
tary force is to fight, and throughout the 
history of the world those countries with the 
largest armed forces have always been the 
aggressors in warfare. In the case of the 
Civil War, the author imagines that the pos- 
session of " an army of trained troops " by the 
North would have resulted in a victory at Bull 
Run and thus ended the war. But why did 
the Southern victory not end the war? And 
with an army of trained troops at her com- 
mand, would the South have been any the less 
reluctant to secede from the Union and thus 
provoke war ? Our reviewer does not say that 
" the militarist sees things as they were in the 



past alone." He says that "the militarist 
finds his warrant in what has been " rather 
than in what ought to be. The difference 
between militarist and anti-militarist is simi- 
lar to the difference between the bourbon 
slaveholder of ante bellum days and the aboli- 
tionist. To the former, slavery was an estab- 
lished institution, based on " natural laws," 
which had always existed and so always must 
exist : to the latter it was a menace to civiliza- 
tion that must be wiped out at any cost.

AN ANCIENT JOURNALISTIC JEST. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

It has long been the fashion of the Eastern press 
to make the word Chicago synonymous with pork, 
wheat, and wind, and to refuse to admit the possi- 
bility of culture. I have sometimes wondered how 
far this convention is due to the Chicago daily 
newspapers themselves. 

Recently a serious association of writers, the 
Society of Midland Authors, completed its organi- 
zation in this city. Its founders were Messrs. 
Hamlin Garland, H. C. Chatfield-Taylor, William 
Allen White, Emerson Hough, and others equally 
prominent, and its roll contains the names of nearly 
all the well-known writers in the Middle West. The 
morning after the meeting one of our leading dailies 
gave the new society a column with the heading, 
"Thrill Spillers Feast and Play: Stuff Selling 
Well." The article began with the ancient jest 
reclothed in the following form : " Chicago, the 
city of wheat corners and meat trusts, witnessed 
another naughty combine when twenty-six authors 
wiggled their fingers at the Sherman anti-trust law 
and corraled all of the divine afflatus," etc. 

Probably an article written in just this vein could 
not have appeared in a reputable newspaper of any 
other American city large enough to form the head- 
quarters of such an organization. It is not an 
isolated case, but has been repeated in one form or 
another in the news columns of nearly all of the 
Chicago dailies when the subject of authorship is 
approached. I do not refer to the review columns ; 
they are for the most part admirably managed, and 
are, on the whole, the equal of any in the country. 

It is not to be supposed that the authors them- 
selves take these good-natured slaps with great 
seriousness. They may smile rather wearily at the 
antiquity of the jest, and let it pass. But the news- 
papers that assume this attitude toward literature 
are giving color to the laugh that has always been 
raised in the East against Chicago culture. If the 
Chicago dailies are to be regarded as the makers 
of public opinion, they should take different ground 
than this ; if they are to be considered as the reflex 
of public opinion, they should have some regard for 
the increasingly large number of citizens who wish 
to see Chicago freed from its ancient stigma. 

There are some who hope that the time is coming 
when the men and women who write books will not 
be regarded by our city press as a subject only for 
merriment, WALTER TAYLOR FIELD.

SHAKESPEAREAN ACTORS.* 



To praise in formal terms at this late date

pre-eminent Shakespeare editor and scholar, 
the late Dr. Furness, wrote (in commending 
its initial volume), "Never before has there 
been, within the same compass, so much truth 
and wisdom uttered concerning the acting and 
interpretation of Shakespeare," would savor 
strongly of superfluity if not of absurdity. 
Some indication of the contents and main 
features of the second series of Mr. William 
Winter's " Shakespeare on the Stage " will 
sufficiently introduce the book to those inter- 
ested in this rich garnering of more than half 
a century's criticism and reflection in the field 
of Shakespearean stage presentation in En- 
gland and America. 

As in the opening volume, so in this, six plays 
are considered ; namely, " Twelfth Night," 
"Romeo and Juliet," "As You Like It," 
"King Lear," "The Taming of the Shrew," 
and "Julius Caesar." A brief history of the 
play, including some account of its early 
presentation, is first given, in each instance, 
and is followed by descriptions of subsequent 
memorable performances, these descriptions 
becoming more and more vivid and entertain- 
ing as the times are reached wherein the 
writer was old enough to have personal knowl- 
edge of that whereof he writes. Appraisements 
and comparisons of leading Sha.kespeare im- 
personators fill much of the space, and the 
numerous portraits of these actors and ac- 
tresses in stage costume heighten the effect of 
the author's descriptions. Cold must be the 
temperament of him who refuses to kindle 
with some reminiscent ardor over these recol- 
lections of the Shakespearean triumphs of 
Edwin Booth and John McCullough and 
Henry Irving, of Adelaide Neilson and Mary 
Anderson and Ada Rehan, with many others, 
some of whom will have entered into the play- 
going experience of the great majority of 
those who turn Mr. Winter's pages. His warm 
but always intelligent appreciation of good 
acting shows itself repeatedly, as for instance 
in his glowing accounts of that masterpiece of 
histrionic art, Adelaide Neilson's impersona- 
tion of Juliet. Here as elsewhere he lays 
emphasis on the importance of a well-con- 
ceived artistic purpose, of a certain detach- 
ment that forbids the player to lose himself in

Winter. Illustrated. New York : Moffat, Yard & Co. 



his part, however passionate may be the emo- 
tions he is called upon to portray. In Miss 
Neilson's acting, he says, " the mind, invaria- 
bly and rightly, controlled the feelings." And 
further, with a grace of diction and a critical 
penetration that will not be lost upon the 
appreciative reader, he continues : 

" Miss Neilson's Juliet was a being all truth, 
innocence, ardor, and loveliness, in whose aspect, 
nevertheless, there was something ominously sug- 
gestive of predestination to misery, herself mean- 
while being pathetically unconscious of her doom. 
It was not so much what the actress said and did 
as what she was that permeated her performance 
of Juliet with this strange, touching quality, which 
saddened even while it enthralled; it was the per- 
sonality of the woman, not only captivating the 
senses but powerfully affecting the imagination. 
All that she said and did, however, had been care- 
fully considered. Nothing had been left to chance. 
She knew what she intended to do, and she knew 
how to do it for which reason the personation 
was distinct, rounded, cumulative in effect, and 
free equally from tameness and extravagance. She 
had, as all actors of genius have, moments of sud- 
den insight and electrical impulse, in which fine 
things are unpremeditatedly done, but she was, 
intrinsically, an artist, and over all that she said 
and did and seemed to be there was a dominance 
of artistic purpose which, without sacrifice of the 
glamour of poetry, made the poetic ideal an actual, 
natural human being." 

There is more that one is tempted to quote, 
exquisite in delicate appreciation and vivid in 
apt selection of epithet and phrase; but the 
reader's full enjoyment of the book itself must 
not be unduly forestalled. Instead, and as an 
amusing illustration of Mr. Winter's other 
manner, of his command of sarcasm and his 
ability to voice in no uncertain tones his un- 
flattering opinion of an inferior and preten- 
tious performance, let us insert a few of his 
remarks on a quite different interpretation of 
the same favorite Shakespeare character: 

"... The tragedy was produced, for the pur- 
pose of ' starring ' Miss Mather, by Mr. James M. 
Hill, of Chicago, since deceased, a genial specula- 
tor in popular ' amusements/ who believed, with 
Bottom, that Tragedy should not be permitted to 
fright the ladies. 'A lion among ladies,' says the 
immortal weaver, 'is a most dreadful thing.' In 
Mr. Hill's production, accordingly, the play, 
arranged in six acts, sixteen scenes, and nine 
tableaux, was considerately invested with the 
accessories of decorum and soothing domesticity. 
In the scene of the secret marriage of Romeo and 
Juliet two monks, moved, apparently, by springs, 
suddenly came out of the wall of Friar Lawrence's 
Cell and placed hassocks for the bride and groom 
to kneel on, while the service was in progress. 
Juliet's Bed-room, the time of her nuptials being 
the middle of July, in a hot country, was thought- 
fully provided with a large fire of brightly blazing 
logs. On the morning appointed for her wedding

a numerous company of young women entered her 
chamber, to awaken her with cheerful song, but, 
finding her dead, those accommodating vocalists 
placidly ranged themselves about the apartment and 
sang an appropriate and moving dirge. Juliet's 
Tomb, a huge, gilded structure, shaped like a glove- 
box interiorly illuminated, was exteriorly flooded 
with ' moonlight,' shed from a glaring ' lime.' And 
at the last, as a decent, orderly, becoming close to 
the spectacle of affliction, many friars thronged 
into the graveyard and sang the ' Miserere,' 
seeming to imply that Borneo, when on his way to 
the Tomb, had heedfully paused at the Abbey and 
bespoken ecclesiastical participation in the forth- 
coming obsequies. To enhance the effect of these 
imposing novelties Mr. Hill furnished highly- 
colored scenery that shone like a brass coal-scuttle. 
As I viewed the spectacle I thought of an old play 
in which the comedian Burton was exceedingly 
droll, acting an ignorant parvenu, who, being asked 
whether, in the furnishing of his library, he wanted 
to have f all the old authors,' exclaims, ' No, not a 
damn' one of 'em! All new!'" 

In his chapter on " King Lear," the longest 
and perhaps the most noteworthy in the book, 
the author makes clear, incidentally, what his 
doctrine as elsewhere stated might seem to 
contradict, that art is not all-powerful on the 
stage, that even a great actor's intelligent con- 
ception of his part may be neutralized more 
or less by peculiarities or defects of tempera- 
ment. Concerning Edwin Forrest's acting of 
Lear, which the author witnessed many times, 
he has considerable to say, of which a part is 
here given. 

" Forrest was never indefinite. In all his acting 
clarity of design was conspicuous, and strength of 
person went hand in hand with strength of pur- 
pose. He knew his intention and he possessed 
absolute control of the means needful for its ful- 
filment. He was never weakened by self -distrust. 
He never wavered. Adamantine authority, inflexi- 
ble repose, explicit intent, directness of execution, 
and physical magnetism were his principal imple- 
ments, and he used them freely and finely. His 
figure was commanding, his voice copious and reso- 
nant. He was a man of prodigious individuality, 
an egotist of the most positive type. The beauties 
of his acting were much upon the surface; the 
defects of it were largely those of his character. 
In the vigorous maturity of his professional life 
his King Lear was little more than an exhibition 
of himself; an exceedingly strong and resolute 
man, assuming, not very convincingly, the appear- 
ance of being old, and imitating, cleverly but not 
pathetically, the condition of madness. In his later 
years he had become much changed. Thought, 
study, observation, experience, and the silent dis- 
cipline of time, had, in a measure, chastened his 
egotistical spirit and refined his art. Misfortune, 
sickness, and suffering had done their work on him, 
as they do on others. The last time I saw him as 
King Lear he played the part as it should be 
played, and was like the breaking and then broken 
old man that King Lear is." 



The natural tendency of a dramatic critic 
of Mr. Winter's age and experience to favor 
the old methods and distrust the new, appears 
by implication here and there, and explicitly 
in more or less positive utterances scattered 
through the book, notably in certain passages 
of his preface like the following : 

" No account has been attempted of the methods 
employed by such eccentric pretenders to origi- 
nality as Herr Max Reinhardt, Mr. Granville 
Barker, and Mr. Gordon Craig. Judgment as to 
their productions necessarily waits until they have 
been seen and studied. Their methods, if I can 
trust what I have read and heard about them, 
are, variously, degenerate, contemptible, and silly, 
in fact, an abomination." 

Mr. Ben Greet's attempt to give us Shake- 
speare somewhat in the Elizabethan manner 
fails to win the author's applause. In his 
opening chapter he takes occasion to say : 

" Mr. Greet is aware, and he has so signified in 
print, that the old mode of producing Shake- 
speare's plays ' can only be reflected to a limited 
extent/ in which case the reflection is, practi- 
cally, barren of ' educational ' value. This mana- 
ger's actual purpose, as distinguished from his 
pretended one, is commercial, and as such a purpose 
is honest it should not be associated with a sophis- 
tical and fatuous pretence, which smacks of hum- 
bug. To produce plays as, probably or certainly, 
they were produced three hundred years ago, before 
Science had made discoveries and Ingenuity had 
contrived inventions which Taste has employed to 
revolutionize all the old processes of industry and 
art, is only to do badly that which can be done 
well ; and to do this under the pretence of serving 
the cause of ' education ' is to be disingenuous." 
But may not half a loaf be better than no 
bread? Even a partial return from the dis- 
tracting elaboration of the modern Shake- 
spearean performance to something like the 
austere simplicity of Shakespeare's own time 
may have real value, even "educational" 
value, in spite of Mr. Winter's serious doubts. 

Four more volumes, the author announces, 
remain to be written in this series, so that it is 
not yet the time to point out any conspicuous 
omissions, any over-emphasis upon the old- 
time stars at the expense of their modern suc- 
cessors in the Shakespearean firmament. An 
occasional foreglimpse of what is to be ex- 
pected in those volumes is given in the present 
one, and the sustained interest of the completed 
work may be taken for granted. Announce- 
ment of half a dozen other prospective works, 
largely devoted to actors and acting, promises 
still further delights to Mr. Winter's readers. 
May they reach completion and fall nothing 
short of this volume in engaging quality, 
refining influence, and intellectual stimulus!

A CRITIC'S CREDO.* 

For all who have read Mr. "W. C. Brownell's 
few severely and serenely weighed volumes of 
criticism, and have come to know him as one 
of America's leading critics, an arbiter who 
may well challenge comparison with his best 
contemporaries in England, it is a pleasure to 
turn to the recent slender volume in which he 
formulates his critical credo. One finds noth- 
ing disappointing in these pages, with their 
characteristic tough-sinewed style, perhaps a 
little more gnarled than usual but bright with 
carefully distilled epigrams, cunning with 
logic, full of learned words sometimes almost 
queerly Johnsonian, but striding quite natu- 
rally in buskins. " Criticism itself is much 
criticized," says Mr. Brownell, "which logi- 
cally establishes its title." He answers those 
who say that " only artists should write about 
art " by observing that the artist has, in gen- 
eral, a point of view which is either merely 
"personal and not professional" or conven- 
tional ; in either case it is not likely to receive 
well the innovations or reactions of another 
artist. 

In considering the field and function "of 
criticism, Mr. Brownell first classifies "all 
artistic accomplishment " into the " moral and 
material." The critic needs a less elaborate 
knowledge of the material (technique) than 
the practitioner. Indeed, such knowledge in 
excess would tempt the critic "to exploit it 
rather than subordinate it," and thus lose the 
perfect poise upon which Arnold insisted. 
Hence the impatience of the artist, who often 
seeks in criticism "what it is the province of 
the studio to provide." Thus also it comes 
about that " artistic innovation meets nowhere 
with such illiberal hostility as it encounters in 
its own hierarchy, and less on temperamental 
than on technical grounds." "The proper 
judge of the tiller," moreover, " is not the car- 
penter but the helmsman." The material data 
are far less significant for the critic than the 
moral. No artist can achieve greatly without 
the moral attributes. But the artist-critic 
generally neglects these to gossip about mere 
craftsmanship, while the true critic signalizes 
these life-giving qualities. " The true objects 
of his contemplation are the multifarious ele- 
ments of truth, beauty, goodness, and their 
approximations and antipodes, underlying the 
various phenomena which express them, 
rather than the laws and rules peculiar to 
each form of phenomenal expression; which, 
beyond acquiring the familiarity needful for 
adequate appreciation, he may leave to the 
professional didacticism of each." 



* CRITICISM. By W. C. Brownell. 
Scribner's Sons. 



New York: Charles 



Let the critic remember that " no one knows 
his subject who knows his subject alone " and 
provide himself with a rich equipment. Since 
literature is a criticism of life, he must know 
life intimately, and he must have a philosophy 
of life in order that his " individuality " may 
" achieve outline." To Mr. Brownell, history 
seems to take first rank among the general 
departments of knowledge necessary for the 
critic's broader equipment. ^Esthetics, too, 
are very valuable, though their field is deemed 
more restricted than that of history. Let the 
literary critic know art, and the critic of art 
know letters. Cultivate divine philosophy, 
but sparingly ; "its peculiar peril is pedantry." 
As examples of critics who have profited by 
this "cognate calling," Mr. Brownell names 
Sainte-Beuve, Taine, and Scherer, and dis- 
cusses them (as indeed he comes later to 
discuss others) with deep penetration. 

" I know nothing of art," says the Philistine, 
" but I know what I like." For retort, let us 
recall Mr. Vedder's words : " So do the beasts 
of the field." Criticism must have a criterion. 
Impressionism may "be strictly defined as 
appetite": and though in its great practi- 
tioners it "has certainly nothing gross about 
it," it is limited by its habit of giving deci- 
sions without reasons and so cannot validate 
"its decisions for the acceptance of others." 
Impressionism rises, to be sure, from a fine 
sense of tolerance. But since there is no uni- 
versal taste, a critic "to be convincing must 
appeal to some accepted standard. And the 
aim of criticism is conviction." Yet one must 
beware of reacting against impressionism in 
the manner of Brunetiere. His destructive 
work was good. But constructively he could 
place against mere personal preference a cri- 
terion no better than "the classic canon" of 
the art of the seventeenth century, an art 
august, but forever departed. " Though he 
became a distinguished scholar, Brunetiere 
retained the temperament of schoolmaster" 
(a defect which may the reviewer interject 
it ? is equally fatal to a critic and a school- 
master). Let the true arbiter be humbler, 
and learn from impressionism at least this 
that even Euclidian proof demands postulates, 
that critical dogmas "rest finally upon in- 
stinct," and that "faith underlies reason." 
Moreover, the postulates of criticism are, un- 
like those of mathematics, " taken for granted 
rather than self-evident." and are often mere 
specious conventions "that depend on the 
sanction of universal agreement." Hence 
come the imperious but transitory conventions 
of romanticism, realism, symbolism, and so 
forth, setting fashions importunately only to 
stand out at last as but vaguely and imper- 



376

f ectly related to eternal principles. The really 
eternal postulates have varied little since the 
days of Aristotle. Let us then call upon the 
impressionist, who advances a new intuition, 
" to tell us why " since intuition does not go 
far without reason. We should ask : "Is your 
feeling the result of direct intuitive percep- 
tion, or of unconscious subscription to conven- 
tion " which the reason may winnow away as 
quasi-intuition, chaff, prejudice ? Impression- 
ism unsupported by intuition may well im- 
peach the reason, but let it remember that the 
reason is not to be dethroned. The critic must 
judge, not merely " testify and record." With 
the bright instrument of the reason he is no 
longer the old-fashioned judge, " the slave of 
schools," or the irresponsible impressionist, 
"the sponsor of whim." Reason alone can 
deal fairly with our great contemporary prob- 
lem of " realism," and show when " realism " 
becomes unreal, or where the opponent of 
realism confuses " the ideal with the fantas- 
tic." Finally, the rational criterion will serve 
better than all others to determine " the rela- 
tion of art and letters to the life that is their 
substance and their subject as well." 

And a rational criterion implies a construc- 
tive method. In itself, analysis reaches no 
conclusion, which is the end and aim of rea- 
son. Here Sainte-Beuve often fell short. We 
must, as critics, have a thesis quite as much as 
do those works of art which we criticize. Yet 
the constructive method tempts readily to ex- 
cess, a central conception often leads to the 
"partisanship of Carlyle, the inelasticity of 
Taine, the prescriptive formulary of Brune- 
tiere. The spirit of system stifles freedom of 
perception and distorts detail." As we ap- 
proach such criticism, either as readers or as 
practitioners, we must guard against untrust- 
worthiness, yet keep our minds open to the 
values of its artistry, its insight, its genuine 
instructiveness. The now popular historical 
method reveals most markedly the excess of 
the constructive method. Taine, for instance, 
was not a critic but a philosophical historian. 
But if he blurs individual traits he certainly 
illumines general perspectives. The rest may 
be left to pure criticism ; for though the his- 
torical method has rendered great constructive 
services, it tends to impose theory on the lit- 
erature and aesthetic facts rather than to reveal 
their essential character. Taine spent too 
much time on causes, too little on characteris- 
tics; he was content w r ith explanation, and 
unfortunately chose not to pass on to estima- 
tion. The true critic remembers that " theory 
means preconception," preconception which, 
"based as it perforce is upon some former 
crystallization of the diverse and undulating 



elements of artistic expression, is logically 
inapplicable at any given time except as it 
draws its authority from examples of perma- 
nent value and enduring appeal, in which case 
no one would think of calling it preconcep- 
tion at all." This does not mean that criticism 
must become ancillar3% concerned merely with 
collecting data for the synthesist. Sainte- 
Beuve's achievement is larger than Taine's 
and " Sainte-Beuve's work is itself markedly 
synthetic " in its special way, although it 
dwells on material examples and concrete 
ideas rather than on systems and theories. 
Such criticism may find unity through a 
proper consideration of the author under 
judgment. " For personality is the most 
concrete and consistent entity imaginable, 
mysteriously unifying the most varied and 
complicated attributes." 

" For beyond denial criticism is itself an art ; 
and, as many of its most successful products have 
been entitled ' portraits,' sustains a closer analogy 
at its best with plastic portraiture than with such 
pursuits as history and philosophy, which seek sys- 
tem through science. One of Sainte-Beuve's stud- 
ies is as definitely a portrait as one of Holbein's; 
and on the other hand a portrait by Sargent, for 
example, is only more obviously and not more 
really, a critical product than are the famous ' por- 
traits ' that have interpreted to us the generations 
of the great." 

But the critic, if wise, will "confine himself 
to portraiture and eschew the panorama." 
" His direct aim is truth even in dealing with 
beauty, forgetting which his criticism is menaced 
with transmutation into the kind of poetry that one 
' drops into ' rather than attains. . . . The end of 
our effort is a true estimate of the data encountered 
in the search for that beauty which from Plato to 
Keats has been virtually identified with truth, and 
the highest service of criticism is to secure that the 
true and the beautiful, and not the ugly and the 
false, may in wider and wider circles of apprecia- 
tion be esteemed to be the good." 

Many of Mr. Brownell's dicta for exam- 
ple, that " faith underlies reason " and that 
"theory means preconception," tempt his 
reader to believe that when he speaks of 
" reason," to which he rightly attaches such a 
vast importance, he has the deductive method 
in mind most of the time. As far as the de- 
ductive method goes, we may well agree that 
the position of faith is to underlie reason, 
to underlie it in the guise of a premise. But 
when we turn to the inductive method, may 
we not come nearer to precision by saying 
that since the inductive method never abso- 
lutely exhausts its data, the conclusion (now 
mingling perforce with some of our rigidly 
suppressed, nay completely forgotten, intui- 
tions) is a kind of faith that comes as a 
climax superimposed upon the honest and 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



377 



austere practice of rational investigation? 
Similarly, to the inductive reasoner, theory 
need not mean a preconceptioii that will para- 
lyze or even influence one's alertness for new 
facts and truths. An inductive critic may 
well begin with a childlike acceptance of the 
generalizations of his predecessor, examine the 
collected data, discover new instances (as a 
new age always permits him), and come at 
the end to his own theory, a theory which is 
almost sure to modify if not reject the conclu- 
sions of the earlier critic. I do not mean to 
say that Mr. Brownell neglects the inductive 
method. But he appears to turn with the 
greater readiness to syllogisms. In seeking 
for the One amidst the welter of the Many, in 
his quest for eternal principles, he becomes 
rather diffident, and would force too severe 
limitations on criticism. You must not be 
wanton, he realizes, in urging premises on your 
readers. For this reason he distrusts the old 
critic, " the slave of schools " ; and so he well 
may. Yet Mr. Brownell should turn again to 
the judgment of. Dame Nature at the close of 
the great debate for supremacy between Jove 
and Mutabilitie, the awful arbiter of the One 
and the terrible and beautiful titaness who 
swayed the Many: 
" I well consider all that ye have saycl, 
And find that all things stedfastnes doe hate 
And changed be : yet being rightly wayd, 
They are not changed from their first estate ; 
But by their change their being doe dilate : 
And turning to themselves at length againe, 
Doe worke their owne perfection so by fate : 
Then over them Change doth not rule and raigne, 
But they raigne over Change, and doe their states 

maintaine." 

The critic of to-day may well expect to find 
intimations of the One in even the pedantic 
theories of a Bossu on epic. He should not, 
with Coleridge, turn too impatiently from 
these. He will find amidst the chaff of Bossu 
intimations of the One, here and there an 
eternal principle, an eternal being in thought 
which has been not destroyed but dilated by 
the commingling, for all the strife and quali- 
fyings, of many restless and diverse opinions 
of later decades. Mr. Brownell is non-com- 
mittal about the rules. He appears ultimately 
to fall back upon the study and estimate of an 
individual as the only intimation of the One 
with which the critic can with absolute safety 
hope to deal. He warns the critic, for in- 
stance, against working with panorama. But 
this is just where Taine succeeded. Of indi- 
viduals he made warped portraits. But his 
Rubens-like panoramic criticism has a large 
element of soundness, as well as of visual 
splendor, that has placed his " History of 
English Literature," for all its preconcep- 



tions, among the greatest and most enduring 
memories of his century. 

Finally, I cannot accept Mr. Brownell's 
sharp antithesis between the beautiful and 
the ugly, and his assertion that art is con- 
cerned only with the beautiful. Such gen- 
eralizations, all too common, close the mind to 
many masterpieces, in all the arts, from men 
as far apart in time and place and nation as 
Rembrandt and Browning and (may I risk 
the name in such orthodox company?) Arnold 
Schoenberg in some of the most impressive 
parts of the second of his "Drei Klavier- 
Stuecke," Opus 11. I should think, rather, 
of the ugly and the lovely as antipodes, with 
the pretty as a debased version of the lovely 
and the grotesque as a whimsical variation, 
altogether admirable, of the ugly. I should 
add that the ugly contains often strength or 
firmness, massiveness or even sublimity, some 
quality or other lacking in the lovely. There- 
fore the ugly often appeals to us, partly be- 
cause we see therein qualities which when 
wedded with the lovely make that beauty 
which seldom appears in life or art, and even 
then is as evanescent as some fleeting expres- 
sion on the face of a beloved woman that is 
remembered long after death or evil chance 
has stolen away her whole image, remem- 
bered as a benignant siren to lure us on that 
endless quest in which lies the supreme stimu- 
lus of profound and enduring joy-in-life.

A DEFENCE OF SOCIALISM.* 



In " Socialism as the Sociological Ideal" we 
are presented with one more of those visions of 
a purified society which have in the past served 
so useful a purpose in stimulating the imagina- 
tion, and in keeping us alive to the vast imper- 
fections of the economic structure of the world. 
It is at all times good to feel in touch with a 
genuinely altruistic spirit, based upon a divine 
discontent with things as they are, and the 
more so when it takes the form of what Mr. 
H. G. Wells calls " the white passion of state- 
craft." From the lowering atmosphere of the 
well-fed man to whom this is the best of all 
possible worlds, or the hardly less depressing 
company of the philanthropist whose highest 
ideal of society seems to be that of a com- 
munity where one half of the people are con- 
stantly engaged in the endless task of holding 
the other half out of the gutter, it is a relief to 
turn to one who feels the fundamental wrong- 
ness in the present constitution of society and 
has some arguable remedy to offer. And when,

as in the book before us, the philosophy of 
Socialism is expounded in a spirit of sweet 
reasonableness, and without a trace of that 
bitterness which mars so much of such writing, 
one is the more disposed to lend an attentive 
ear and to weigh carefully the arguments ad- 
duced. It might hastily be concluded that all 
that can be said in defence of Socialism has 
long ago been said ; but against this contention 
it must be remembered that recent develop- 
ments in the conduct of industry, taking place 
as they do at a constantly accelerating pace, 
make much that has formerly been written 
inapplicable and out-of-date; and that conse- 
quently a re-statement of the case for a social- 
istic reorganization of industry, in full view 
of present-day phases in the relationship be- 
tween labor and capital, should be acceptable. 
It should also be said of this book, as cannot 
be affirmed of all such apologies for Socialism, 
that it is pervaded through and through by 
the higher idealism. It is the liberation of 
the human spirit from the fell clutch of cir- 
cumstance that the writer obviously aspires to. 
Socialism is advocated because of the recogni- 
tion that the higher life is conditioned on a 
sound physical and economic basis. In the 
author's own words, " Socialism is as wide as 
man's aspirations. Its aims must be those of 
our common humanity." 

With this preliminary testimony, given in 
all sincerity, to the readableness and useful- 
ness of the book as a provocative of thought, 
it remains to be said that it will be found un- 
convincing by the man whose mind is still 
open, and in our opinion will seem conclusive 
only to those whose judgments are already 
formed in the same direction. 

In the first place, Dr. Melvin makes the mis- 
take which characterizes the writings of most 
apostles of Socialism, the mistake of assum- 
ing, what still requires proof, that Socialism 
is necessary before economic justice can pre- 
vail in society. The assumption is implicit, 
from beginning to end of the book, that in the 
original structure of human relationships 
there is an inherent wayward tendency for 
things to go awry, and that it is normal or 
natural in an unregulated condition of human 
intercourse, or mutual exchange of services, 
for wealth to distribute itself with no regard 
to fairness and equity. Now this is just the 
point as to which many earnest and intelli- 
gent thinkers are still in doubt. There still 
stubbornly lingers the subconscious suspicion 
that if we understood properly the basic natu- 
ral laws which constitute the science of politi- 
cal economy, and conformed our actions to 
those laws, we should find that human affairs 
"have not this perverse tendency to go wrong, 



and that justice and not injustice is the natu- 
ral outcome of free or unregulated effort, when 
undeflected by monopoly or special privilege. 
Thtsre persist the aspiration for more light, 
and that faith in the constitution of the uni- 
verse, which find expression in the words of 
Milton, " What in me is dark, illumine ; that 
to the height of this great argument I may 
assert Eternal Providence and justify the 
ways of God to man." It is surely, then, an 
apposite question to ask and answer, whether 
the eternal order of things is such that it 
should be necessary for man to suspend the 
operation of natural law, and set up instead 
a system of artificial law which shall work out 
results more in conformity with his moral 
sense than natural law will yield. When a 
physician is diagnosing the case of a patient 
whose blood circulation is weak, whose heart 
and lungs are functioning irregularly, and all 
of whose organs are working more or less in- 
harmoniously with each other, he does not 
assume this disharmony to be normal but ab- 
normal, and seeks to trace the disorder to one 
disturbing cause, believing as he must that 
in the absence of such a cause there would have 
been no occasion for his interference. 

It is, we believe, because of the omission to 
make this preliminary inquiry that Dr. Mel- 
vin has fallen upon certain assumptions that 
seem to weaken or invalidate the superstruc- 
ture of conclusions to which he invites us. The 
antithesis, for example, between society con- 
ceived of as an organism and as an organiza- 
tion, is somewhat arbitrary and artificial. Is 
it true, we may ask, that in an organism " all 
significant individuality is denied to the con- 
stituent parts"? Notwithstanding that the 
authority of Herbert Spencer may be quoted 
in support of this postulate, and which indeed 
Spencer advances only as a modifying con- 
sideration to his elaborate argument that so- 
ciety is an organism, we submit that in the 
light of recent psycho-physiological researches 
the postulate may be questioned, and it may 
well be doubted whether we are yet on the 
threshold of a true understanding of the na- 
ture of the organic cell. It is always unsafe 
to argue from ignorance; and it may be, as 
seems now probable, that we cannot deny to 
the individual cell an incipient consciousness 
analogous to the imperfect civic consciousness 
which is all that can be found in most of the 
members of a community. On the other hand, 
in what the process of organization can differ 
from the natural organic process, by which 
certain cells are specialized and set apart to 
do the thinking and directing, is not apparent. 
The opposition then, between the ideas of 
organism and organization, on which Dr. Mel- 



1915]

vin appears to lay considerable weight, seems 
to lead nowhere in particular and to be of 
little value as an illuminative concept. 

Out of this distrust of natural processes, 
Dr. Melvin has obviously fallen into the as- 
sumption that the confessedly artificial system 
of human relationships which Socialism would 
set up may be identified with democracy. 
Democracy is one of those concepts the full 
content of which will probably reveal itself to 
the human mind only after much experience 
and many strenuous efforts in the art of liv- 
ing; and it may be doubted whether we are 
yet within sight of its true significance. None 
of the modern catch-words of liberalism ex- 
haust its deepest and most fundamental mean- 
ings. Mere majority-rule can surely never be 
mistaken for the last word in democracy? 
That fifty-one per cent should compel the other 
forty-nine into a certain way of living, may 
be expedient at a certain stage in the evolution 
of society, and be preferable to chaos, as the 
more reasonable of the minority may admit; 
but it is not democracy. Neither is " govern- 
ment of the people by the people and for the 
people " a full expression of democracy, so 
long as it takes no account of the man who 
wants -neither to govern nor to be governed but 
simply to be let alone to earn his own living 
and live his own life, subject only to the con- 
dition that he does not infringe upon the sim- 
ilar liberty of others. A socialist organization, 
therefore, that is not voluntary to the last 
and most insignificant unit composing the 
group is not a democracy, whatever argument 
of expediency may be adduced in its favor. 

To the same distrust of nature's methods, 
growing out of a very laudable revulsion from 
the Darwinian struggle-for-existence theory of 
life, we attribute Dr. Melvin's terror of compe- 
tition, and his identification of it as the mod- 
ern equivalent of exterminative warfare. In 
general it may be said that the mind with a 
pre-disposition towards Socialism has a rooted 
inability to imagine the current of competi- 
tion running in an opposite direction from 
that which it now takes. At present we see 
laborers competing against each other for the 
permission of the capitalists that they may 
earn their livings ; and we note the physical, 
moral, and aesthetic deterioration of character 
which results. But what if we conceive of a 
condition of things where capitalists should be 
competing with each other for the privilege of 
employing labor, and were compelled to offer, 
higher and still higher remuneration, and bet- 
ter and still better conditions as to hours and 
protection from danger, as the only means of 
obtaining workers ? That it should be difficult 
.to imagine such a relationship between labor 



and capital is only another instance of the 
tyranny of custom and tradition on our modes 
of thought. In the subconscious backgrounds 
of most open minds there persists the belief 
that in some discoverable condition of human 
freedom, such as we have never yet realized, 
this latter kind of competition would be the 
natural one. It is this unformulated belief 
that makes humane people defend labor-saving 
machinery, notwithstanding its very disastrous 
effects under present conditions in displacing 
workers and causing destitution. For we 
know instinctively that the invention of ma- 
chinery ought to save labor in a true sense, and 
not in the cruel sense to which we are accus- 
tomed. And it is because we trust our in- 
stincts, and distrust our arguments, that we 
hesitate to prefer what Dr. Melvin calls "the 
superstructure of man's purposive creation " 
to "the basic unpurposive natural order 
which seems to ignore the harmonies de- 
manded by man." (The italics are ours.) 

As to the problem of distribution again, 
Dr. Melvin thinks that the ultimate educa- 
tional ideal " can be set down as nothing less 
than to each according to his needs." But 
where shall we find the superman who is wise 
enough and good enough to determine the 
needs of each member of a community? 
"Needs" vary indefinitely in proportion to 
faculty. Nature, indeed, seems wisely to have 
decreed an exact relation between needs and 
the capacity for contributing to the communal 
stock of commodities and services. The man 
of small capacity for adding to the social 
wealth has few needs and desires, while the 
man of large capacity requires large supplies 
of leisure, books, scientific instruments, eas 
chairs, opportunities for travel, companion- 
ship, and many other aids to the full develop- 
ment of his faculties. Is one not justified in 
suspecting that under the free conditions we 
have tried to imagine (to the absence of which 
are probably due all the evils against which 
Socialism is directed) the apportionment "to 
each according to his needs " would take place 
with automatic and unerring accuracy ? 

If it does not savor of hyper-criticism we 
might remark that Dr. Melvin seems on page 
17 to cut away the plank on which he rests his 
argument for the socialization of industry. In 
opposing political individualism he says : 
"All prohibitive government is an enormity if it 
is less or more than a mere representation of the 
natural limitations arising from the mutually con- 
flicting desires of its subjects. The socialist is 
affirming no new or undiscovered principle in op- 
posing political individualism. Thus the socialist 
society as conceived by its advocates seeks to 
embody only those restrictions on the freedom of 
the individual that are naturally inevitable."

Does this not seem to point to just what Dr. 
Melvin repudiates, namely, the restriction of 
governmental function to that of preventing 
aggression of one citizen on another, or what 
Huxley described as "administrative nihilism" 
and some profane Spencerian critic called " a 
glorified police-office for the keeping of the 
peace " ? 

We conclude this imperfect review of a 
stimulating and suggestive book with the as- 
surance that those who wish to know the best 
that can be said for a philosophy that has 
captured the sympathy and enthusiasm of 
thousands, will find here what they require.

Two CANADIAN STATESMEN.* 

Just half a century ago there met in the city 
of Quebec a group of statesmen representing 
the principal colonies of British North Amer- 
ica. They had come together to bring about 
the union of these colonies. After long de- 
liberation they finally agreed upon the terms, 
and drafted a constitution which was ratified 
by each of the colonial legislatures, and finally, 
on July 1, 1867, passed by the imperial parlia- 
ment as the British North America Act. The 
men who thus created out of a group of weak 
and scattered colonies a powerful and ambi- 
tious commonwealth have since been known to 
Canadians as the " Fathers of Confederation." 
They are represented to-day by a single sur- 
vivor, the veteran statesman, Sir Charles 
Tupper, who in his ninety-third year has pub- 
lished a substantial volume of reminiscences, 
throwing a most interesting and valuable light 
upon the history of the confederation move- 
ment and the subsequent development of the 
Dominion. 

Sir Charles Tupper first entered public life 
in 1855, in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, 
having the assurance not only to run against 
the Liberal leader, Joseph Howe, but to defeat 
him. He became a member of the Nova Scotia 
government the following year, remaining 
until 1860. From 1864 to 1867 he was premier 
of the province. The latter year he was elected 
a member of the first Dominion parliament, 
but, although he had been largely instru- 
mental in bringing about confederation, he 
unselfishly stepped aside when John A. Mac- 
donald was forming his first cabinet, to make 
room for his old opponent, Joseph Howe. One 
finds in the "Recollections of Sixty Years" 
the confidential correspondence between Mac- 
donald and Tupper as a result of which Howe, 
who had fiercely opposed the confederation

movement, was finally induced to enter the 
first Dominion cabinet. In 1870 Tupper 
joined the Macdonald ministry as president 
of the council, and in this and succeeding 
administrations he filled the important offices 
of Minister of Inland Revenue, Minister of 
Customs, Minister of Public Works, Minister 
of Railways and Canals, and Minister of 
Finance. From 1884 to 1887, and again be- 
tween 1888 and 1896, he acted as High Com- 
missioner for Canada in England, and for his 
services to the country he was created a bar- 
onet. In 1896, when the Conservative admin- 
istration had fallen upon evil days, they sent 
for the old "War Horse of Cumberland," as 
he was called, to lead them in the approach- 
ing general election. In spite of his seventy- 
five years, the prospect of one more political 
battle was irresistible. He immediately re- 
signed his high commissionership, came back 
to Canada as prime minister, and led his party 
gallantly in what he knew must be a losing 
fight. For several years he led the opposition 
in the House of Commons, and finally in 1906, 
at the age of 85, retired from active political 
life. For over half a century Sir Charles 
Tupper served his country faithfully. He 
has seen Canada grow from weakness to 
strength; with the possible exception of Sir 
John Macdonald, no other man has done more 
as a constructive statesman to make the Do- 
minion what it is to-day. 

Apart from the chapters of Sir Charles's 
book which deal more particularly with po- 
litical events and movements, probably the 
most interesting portion is that which tells the 
story of his visit to the Red River Settlement 
in 1870 and his interview with the leader of 
the Half-Breed Rebellion, Louis Riel. Donald 
A. Smith (afterward Lord Strathcona) of the 
Hudson's Bay Company had told him that it 
would be as much as his life was worth to go 
to Fort Garry at that time, particularly as 
Riel and his followers knew the active part 
Tupper had taken in bringing about confed- 
eration, to which they assigned all their 
troubles. "I told him," says Tupper, "that 
I had promised Sir John A. Macdonald to get 
into Fort Garry, and that I intended to do 
so. ' ' And he did. Riel had seized the horses, 
wagons, and baggage of Captain Cameron, 
Tupper 's son-in-law, who had been sent to 
Fort Garry in an official capacity, and Tupper, 
as soon as he reached the fort, made his way 
to the council chamber of the rebel chiefs and, 
after telling Riel who he was, demanded the 
restoration of Cameron's belongings. Riel 
was apparently so taken by surprise that he 
not only permitted Tupper to return in safety, 
but actually restored the spoils of war. The

real object of the seemingly foolhardy visit 
was to get some idea of the situation at Fort 
Garry, and if possible to persuade the rebels 
that they were mad to defy the Dominion 
government, and could remedy their griev- 
ances by peaceful negotiation. Tupper realized 
at once that he could do nothing with Kiel, but 
talked the matter over with Pere Richot, one 
of his principal advisers. He found that the 
rebels were convinced that they could carry 
on a successful guerrilla warfare in the vast 
wilderness of the west, and that in the last 
resort they could annex the western country 
to the United States. He therefore had to 
leave them to their fate. 

Packed with interesting and valuable ma- 
terial to the student of Canadian history, the 
book is distinctly disappointing as a piece of 
composition. The material was evidently put 
by Sir Charles Tupper into the hands of some 
one who either through incompetence or 
through indolence failed to realize his oppor- 
tunity. As a result, what might have been 
an autobiography of the first importance is 
not much more than a scrap-book. 

Sir George Foster's "Canadian Addresses" 
brings together for the first time a selection of 
the principal speeches and public addresses 
in recent years of the Canadian Minister of 
Trade and Commerce, one of the ablest and 
most incisive speakers of the Dominion. Such 
topics are included as "Reciprocity with the 
United States," "The Imperial Conferences/' 
"The Naval Policy," "Problems of Empire," 
"The Call of the State," and "Claims of the 
Nation on the Individual." In an introduc- 
tory chapter, Sir George Foster gives us a 
rapid sketch of the Canada of to-day, from 
the point of view of one who is taking a lead- 
ing part in the moulding of her destiny. 
Coming from such a source, the following is 
of more than passing interest : 

" Canada has to face three problems its own 
internal development, its attitude toward outside 
peoples in respect to settlement within its boun- 
daries, and its relations to the Empire at large. 
As to the first, its policy has grown gradually, 
taken on year by year a firmer consistency, and 
may at the present time be considered as pretty 
definitely settled. It has gained, and will undoubt- 
edly maintain, complete autonomy of government 
and administration. It is now and must continue 
to be practically supreme within its territorial 
boundaries. Government follows the line of a sane 
and reasonable democracy, tempered with the re- 
straints and checks of its monarchial traditions. 
This latter does not greatly obtrude in forms, but 
it permeates with its influences and preserves from 
excess by its conservative tendencies. Manhood 
suffrage practically prevails, and woman suffrage 
is gradually emerging through the lesser gates of 



the municipal to the crowning power of national 
exercise. The protective principle, never since 
Confederation entirely absent from fiscal legisla- 
tion, became dominant in 1879, and has since so 
continued. Joined therewith later was the prin- 
ciple of preferential treatment of British Empire 
products, which now includes practically all the 
imperial possessions except Newfoundland and 
Australia. These will readily be included as soon 
as they find it possible to reciprocate in like de- 
gree. Protection is not high or oppressive, and is 
not likely ever to be raised beyond the point neces- 
sary to place Canadian producers in a position not 
to exclude, but to compete fairly with the nations 
more favoured by circumstances, skill and capital."

THREE BOOKS ON SOUTH AMERICA.* 

During the last few years a marked change 
has taken place in the character of the numer- 
ous books annually written on South America. 
The single volume which attempts to describe 
the whole continent, or rather the fringe of 
coast line ordinarily visited by the hurried 
tourist, has given place to carefully prepared 
works dealing with separate countries or even 
with portions of these countries. Moreover, 
the critical reader is no longer satisfied with 
superficial generalizations, however cleverly 
put; he is justified in demanding that the 
writer not only evince a thorough knowledge 
of the region he is describing, but also be able 
to offer an adequate interpretation of those 
subtler phases of a nation's life included in the 
elusive term civilization. Especially is this 
true at the present time, when one of the unex- 
pected results of the European war has been 
a quickened interest in all that relates to South 
America. 

Among recent offerings in this field it is 
safe to say that none exceeds in interest and 
permanent value the scholarly monograph by 
Mr. Bailey Willis on Northern Patagonia. At 
the invitation of Dr. Ramos-Mexia, the pro- 
gressive Argentine Minister of Public Works, 
Mr. Willis was placed in charge of the Comi- 
sion de Estudios Hidrologicos during the 
period from 1911 to 1913. This commission 
was entrusted with the important task of mak- 
ing an exhaustive topographic, geologic, and 
economic survey of the vast undeveloped and 
little known region of Northern Patagonia, an 
area approximately as large as the State of 
California and stretching from the Atlantic 
Ocean to the boundaries of Chile. The present

THE DIAL 



[ May 13 



monograph, in which are embodied the results 
of Mr. Willis's investigations, falls into two 
general divisions. The first is a detailed de- 
scription of the pampas of Northern Patago- 
nia. This region is generally regarded as a 
country of desert or steppe-like plains, but it 
is neither plain nor desert. Rather is it a 
region of semi-arid grassy plateaus, practically 
all of which is suitable for grazing and much 
of it adapted to agriculture through the use 
of dry farming or irrigation. It presents cer- 
tain analogies to the western territory of the 
United States forty years ago. Thanks to the 
energy of the Minister of Public Works, a 
railroad is being pushed through this region 
from Port San Antonio on the Atlantic to Lake 
Nahuel Huapi at the base of the Andes. The 
districts tributary to this new transconti- 
nental line districts of enormous potential 
value are described at length by Dr. Willis 
as regards soil, climate, rainfall, resources, 
and products. In the land where President 
Mitre's dictum, " to govern is to populate," 
still holds good the importance of Mr. Willis's 
investigation scarcely needs to be stressed. 

Of greater interest to the general reader is 
the second part of the monograph, containing 
a detailed account of the wonderful Andean 
region of Northern Patagonia. Here is a cor- 
ner of South America replete with surprises 
for even the most blase and jaded of globe 
trotters. Countless majestic peaks, forest 
clad and crowned with snow, rise from the 
dark green waters of fjord-like lakes. This 
Andean lake region, so thoroughly and de- 
lightfully described by Mr. Willis, is one of 
the most remarkable in the world, whether we 
consider its extent, the solemn grandeur of its 
mountain scenery, or the number and beauty 
of its lakes. Of these latter there are several 
score which compare with the lakes of Switzer- 
land and Italy, and several hundred which 
would be notable were they situated in the 
British Isles or in the United States, but in 
this little known section of South America 
they are unnamed and uncounted. The most 
beautiful as well as the most important of 
these lakes is thus described by Mr. Willis : 

"Lago Nahuel Huapi, although not one of the 
largest of the Andean lakes, is as long as Lake 
Geneva, but in form it more nearly resembles the 
wide-branching Lake Lucerne. Nowhere are its 
shores for any distance so low or habitable as the 
northern shore of Lac Leman from Geneva to 
Montreux; nor is the expanse of waters so wide 
as that seen in the view from the hills above Lau- 
sanne. Only the east end of Nahuel Huapi lies 
wide open to the sun. The farther reaches of the 
lake and its spreading arms sink deep into the Cor- 
dillera; branching about islands or beyond prom- 
ontories, they penetrate among 1 the highest ranges. 
Neither the magnitude nor the beauty of the lake 



can be grasped in the view from any one point. 
One must explore in launch or sailboat, sail in and 
out past woods and precipices, follow the dark- 
green waters around sharp turns into hidden bays, 
and linger there in the heart of nature's solitudes. 
The open lake is swept by fierce winds. The launch 
must be strong or the sailboat large and sturdy. 
Yet along the lake shores there are amphitheatres 
where the waters lie so deep beneath the high moun- 
tains that the calm of the mirror that reflects the 
overhanging trees is rarely broken. From such 
retreats the traveler may ascend through the jungles 
of graceful bamboo in the deep shade of the 
beech forest to the alpine meadows above tree line, 
or to the perpetual snows and glaciers of Mount 
Tronador." 

It is gratifying to learn that the government 
is planning to reserve the most beautiful por- 
tion of this region as a great national park for 
the pleasure and welfare of the people. But 
Mr. Willis is at pains to point out that this 
fascinating corner of Argentina is destined to 
be more than the playground of the nation. 
The wild mountain torrents descending from 
the Andean glaciers hold out possibilities of al- 
most unlimited industrial development. Care- 
ful investigation has convinced the author that 
the probable available energy which may be 
derived from these streams exceeds two million 
horsepower. When one considers that Argen- 
tina, with all her natural resources, is practi- 
cally without coal the significance of these 
figures is apparent. 

Too high praise cannot be bestowed on the 
large number of magnificent plates with which 
this monograph is illustrated. Never before 
has this Andean region been so adequately and 
artistically portrayed. A supplementary vol- 
ume of maps,, drawn on a large scale and de- 
signed to show not only the various physical 
features but also the resources of Northern 
Patagonia, greatly enhances the usefulness and 
scientific value of the monograph. 

Mr. Algot Lange, the well known Brazilian 
explorer, has added another important work to 
the growing literature on Amazonia. " The 
Lower Amazon " is a very readable account of 
explorations in the more remote regions of the 
State of Para, particularly the district drained 
by the lower Tocantins River. In a simple and 
straightforward way the author describes the 
daily life of the caboclos, or half-breed rubber- 
gatherers, and the manner in which the " black 
gold " of the Amazon Valley is collected and 
marketed; while his training as a student of 
natural history and botany has enabled him to 
bring the flora and fauna of the region vividly 
before the mind of the reader. Several chap- 
ters are devoted to an entertaining account of 
Mr. Lange's sojourn among a little-known 
tribe of Indians living some three hundred 
miles to the north of Para. Of even greater 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



383 



interest is the record of his archaeological in- 
vestigations on the Island of Marajo in the 
delta of the Amazon. Mr. Laiige was fortu- 
nate enough to discover an immense quantity 
of pottery, covered with delicate tracery and 
of remarkable freshness of color. Though he 
does not hazard any judgment as to the age of 
this pottery, he is inclined to believe that it is 
of comparatively recent date. 

Probably the most valuable chapters of the 
book are those containing the author's observa- 
tions on the population and general resources 
of the country. Mr. Lange attempts, frankly 
and fairly, to tell the truth about Amazonia. 
The picture he draws of the inhabitants of this 
region is not reassuring. Unfavorable climatic 
conditions, the exorbitant cost of living, un- 
suitable food, and wretched sanitation have in 
the opinion of the author seriously impaired 
the racial stamina of the North Brazilians. 
Moreover, the country at large is in a state of 
lamentable retrogression and universal pov- 
erty. Paradoxical as it may seem, this un- 
happy condition is due entirely to rubber. 
During a long period of inflated prices the 
inhabitants of Amazonia neglected all other 
sources of wealth ; and now with the competi- 
tion of the cheap plantation-grown rubber of 
the Orient, this good has indirectly turned to 
evil and left the people with no other means of 
subsistence. And yet, adds Mr. Lange : 
" It will be the happiest, luckiest thing that can 
happen to Amazonia in fact, the only thing that 
will prevent a complete relapse into total abandon- 
ment and barbarism, when the Orient captures the 
rubber market, because then Amazonia will be 
forced to wake up and prevent its people from 
starving to death ; indeed this awakening is already 
beginning. Amazonia is learning its greatest les- 
son that is, that it will have to work to cultivate 
its rich soil now that the mine of ' black gold ' 
rubber is rapidly disappearing." 

Mr. Lange dilates on the many resources of 
the country, for the most part still untouched 
and unexploited. Valuable cabinet woods, 
medicinal plants, tobacco, and a wide variety 
of fruits are among the products which may in 
course of time supplant rubber and make 
Amazonia one of the richest countries in the 
world. The book contains a wealth of excel- 
lent illustrations made from the author's own 
photographs. It is distinctly one of the best 
works on the Amazon Valley published in re- 
cent years. 

In " Peru : A Land of Contrasts," Miss 
Millicent Todd has written a book vivacious in 
style and delightful in content. Peru, we are 
told, is a paradox. Any statement regarding 
this country "implies a contrary statement 
equally valid. Contrast is its characteristic 
quality, true as to the general aspects of the 



country and ramifying through remote de- 
tails. It is the obvious point of view from 
which to study Peru." This attitude of the 
writer is consistently maintained throughout 
the book. The people are set over against the 
country ; the prosaic present is contrasted with 
the romantic past ; the dreary desert with the 
icy highland, and both with the inhospitable 
jungle. 

Those who are seeking concrete information 
or a detailed account of the Peru of the twen- 
tieth century may find Miss Todd's book some- 
what disappointing ; this despite the fact that 
it is the result of wide travel and patient in- 
vestigation. It is lacking in explicitness of 
statement, and is quite innocent of statistics ; 
moreover, the writer's fondness for paradoxes 
and antitheses tends to become a trifle palling. 
Yet for one in quest of the real spirit of Peru 
and her marvellous history the book is an open 
sesame. Miss Todd has intuitively caught the 
elusive charm of this land of the Incas and the 
Conquistadores, and in a series of wonderful 
word pictures has' succeeded in communicating 
much of this charm to the reader. As an un- 
usual book on an unusual country, the volume 
is to be heartily commended.

KECENT FICTION.* 



A map which accompanies Mr. Conrad's 
" Victory " is extremely interesting. It indi- 
cates the scenes of the author's long series of 
novels and shorter pieces, as well as the routes 
taken by the ships of his imagination. The 
globe is pretty well circled by these markings, 
and the geographical range of his inventions is 
something extraordinary. The scene of " Vic- 
tory " is the Pacific island of Samburan, a lit- 
tle to the northwest of Samoa, and due east of 
the scene of the story of "Almayer's Folly," in 
which Mr. Conrad's marvellous gift for por- 
traying the psychology of life in the tropics 
was first revealed. The new book is a char- 
acteristic Conrad tale, told with somewhat less 
of indirection than usual, and peopled with 
figures drawn from the flotsam and jetsam of 
humanity as found in the remote regions of 
the earth. A Swede named Heyst is the cen- 
tral figure, living upon an island which has 
been the scene of the operations of a collapsed 
coal company. He is something of a dreamer, 
and money-making is the least of his concerns. 
On a visit to Souraboya (which may be in 
Borneo) he puts up at a hotel kept by a Ger-

man ruffian named Schomberg, and there he 
is attracted by a girl violinist in the orchestra 
that provides entertainment for the disreputa- 
ble frequenters of the resort. She is evidently 
unhappy, and Heyst soon learns that she is 
driven to desperation by Schomberg's odious 
advances, whereupon he helps her to make her 
escape, and takes her to his island home. 
Presently, two of the most precious villains 
that even Mr. Conrad has ever imagined arrive 
at the hotel, and Schomberg determines to 
make them the instruments of his malignant 
revenge. He stuffs them with tales of the 
Swede in his solitary island, and of the treas- 
ure which is probably hoarded there. The 
prospect looks good to them, and they start off 
on the piratical venture. Now in any conven- 
tional story of this description, the villains 
would be thwarted, and their proposed victims 
would come out triumphant. Since we have to 
deal with Mr. Conrad, it is all the other way 
about, and the story ends in a welter of trag- 
edy which leaves none of the four alive. The 
enigmatic title of the romance is accounted for 
by the way in which the young woman meets 
the ordeal. Heyst has not been sure of her 
love, but at the tragic climax every doubt is 
swept from his mind, and the two die united 
in soul. The story is told with the author's 
grim strength, and has not a trace of the senti- 
mental palaver with which a lesser writer 
would beslobber its tense situations. Has any 
man ever known, as this one knows, the soul of 
the human derelict? 

Mr. Geoffrey Corson is a new writer, as far 
as our knowledge goes, and if " Blue Blood and 
Red " be indeed his first performance, it is a 
work of remarkable promise. In all the essen- 
tials of good fiction an interesting story, 
creative characterization, and style it is so 
far out of the ordinary as to stand as one of the 
half-dozen novels of the season's output that 
deserve to be reread and remembered. It is a 
story of purely private interest, with Staten 
Island for its scene, and with its chief figures 
taken from two contrasting elements of the 
local society the aristocratic Carmichaels 
who live on the hill, and the plebeian McCoys 
who live on the shore. Patricia McCoy is the 
heroine, and Neal Carmichael the hero of her 
romantic dreams; these two are predestined 
for one another, although life becomes a com- 
plicated coil for both of them before the con- 
summation of their union. Neal is engaged to 
Patricia early in the story, but the charms of 
Ada Fleming, a heartless aristocratic beauty, 
weaken his allegiance, and Patricia, realizing 
the situation, releases him from his bond. 
Nothing less than marriage with Ada, and liv- 
ing with her for some years, is effective in 



destroying his infatuation, and making him 
realize the utter vanity and selfishness of her 
nature. Meanwhile, Patricia pledges herself 
to an admirer of her own class, who has long 
pursued her with dog-like devotion. Ada's 
renewal of her flirtation with the Englishman 
to whom she had once been engaged provides 
Neal with adequate grounds for divorcing her, 
after which he renews his relations with Patri- 
cia, and, in a moment of passion, seduces her 
an episode which we wish had been spared 
us. This leads to Patricia's flight to hide her 
shame, to the birth of her child, to her even- 
tual discovery by Neal in the place of her 
concealment, and to the marriage which should 
have taken place long before, and which is a 
true union of hearts. The plot has vivacity 
and dramatic action, blending seriousness with 
humor, and giving us the final feeling that we 
have been living in the company of real human 
beings all the time that we have been following 
its involutions. The narrative abounds in 
passages of great beauty, for the author's re- 
sources as a stylist are equal to every emer- 
gency, and respond to all the varied demands 
of his web of invention. The jaded reviewer, 
working his way through the loads of mediocre 
rubbish that clog the yearly output of fiction, 
does not often come upon so rich a prize as this 
admirable novel. 

" La carriere ouverte aux talents " might be 
the motto of " The Ladder," by Mr. Philip 
Curtiss, as it is supposed, generally speaking, 
to be the watchword of life in this Land of 
Opportunity. Franklin Connor is, as the sub- 
title of the novel calls him, " a casual man." 
There is nothing outstanding in his character 
or ability, but he is an expert base-ball player, 
and this fact, after he runs away from Aunt 
Louise and domestic tyranny, stands him in 
such stead that the way is smoothed for him to 
go through college, although the honors he 
wins are anything but academic. Then he 
enlists as a soldier in the war with Spain, from 
which he emerges unscarred, but with an offi- 
cer's rank, which in turn brings him political 
honors at the hands of a grateful common- 
wealth. So he climbs the social ladder, rung 
by rung, without any apparent effort, becomes 
engaged to the wrong girl and eventually mar- 
ries the right one, and illustrates in his career 
the ease with which the average American of 
good physique and commonplace intelligence 
can overcome most of life's handicaps, and be- 
come a successful citizen of the republic. The 
story is typical of our social conditions, and 
for that very reason, without recourse to the 
sensational, and with only a sober and un- 
imaginative method of narration, contrives to 
make itself interesting in a prosaic way, and to

impose its optimistic mood upon the reader. 
The only thing in the hero's career which 
strains credulity is the fact that he is made to 
write, " off the bat," and without any technical 
training whatsoever, a play which proves an 
immediate success, and places his material for- 
tunes beyond the reach of envious fate. 

The "Lost Sheep" of Mr. Vere Shortt's 
tale are the men of the French Foreign Legion. 
Jim Lingard, an Englishman who has squan- 
dered a fortune in riotous living, finds him- 
self reduced to his last shilling, and enlists in 
the Legion as a desperate last resort. He has 
several years of adventurous service on the 
edge of the African desert, and barely escapes 
with his life from an uprising of the fanatical 
Senussi. The daughter of the rebel chief 
teaches him the meaning of romance, and the 
sacrifice of her life in saving his provides an 
element of poignant tragedy. The end of the 
story leaves Lingard, promoted for valor, quite 
satisfied with his career and evidently deter- 
mined to remain an officer of the Legion until 
the inevitable end overtakes him. The value 
of this book, aside from its quality of pictur- 
esque adventure, lies in its minute description 
of the life of the Foreign Legion a picture 
as different as possible from that given by 
"" Ouida " and other lady-novelists of both 
sexes, and evidently based upon an intimate 
acquaintance with the facts. The style is dull, 
and the invention anything but remarkable, 
but somehow a considerable degree of interest 
is sustained. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

Miss Fannie Caldwell Macaulay, who was known 
as Frances Little when she wrote " The Lady of 
the Decoration " and evidently prefers still to be 
called so, again adopts the Japan she knows so well 
for the scene of " The House of the Misty Star: A 
Romance of Youth and Hope and Love in Old 
Japan " ( Century Co. ) . The narrative is told by 
an old American school-teacher long resident near 
a minor Japanese city, and its title is the name of 
lier cottage. To her come a missionary blessed with 
a faith that circumstances justify wonderfully, a 
young man who had been so stricken with tropical 
fever that he imagined himself to be a criminal, and 
the daughter of a widowed native whose husband 
(the girl's father) was an American artist. Here 
is material for sentiment abundant and overflowing, 
and the author makes a great deal of it. The char- 
acters are drawn with a clearness that speaks well 
for Miss Little's literary future. 

Pots and potters have been beloved of literature 
ver since the primeval discovery that they could 
lend so many apt figures of speech to the writer's 
tale, and there is no sign of the lessening of their 
popularity to that end. The latest novel by Mr. 
Eden Phillpotts, "Brunei's Tower" (Macmillan), 
is the story of an English master-potter who moulds 



his work-people to his will quite as he moulds and 
shapes his vases and other wares. There comes to 
his factory a youthful fugitive from justice, in 
whom the master sees material for the making of a 
character valuable both to himself and to the world. 
The boy repays this kindness with single-minded 
devotion, even to the doing of wrong that his 
employer may profit. Reproved and driven out 
for his allowing the end to justify evil means, the 
lad comes to repay evil with good. While the 
tragic ending is not implicit in the story, all that 
precedes it is so ably written, and the background 
is so fully symbolic of the characters before it, 
that the book deserves high praise as a piece of 
literary artistry. 

The mountain people of North Carolina among 
whom Mrs. Payne Erskine has lived so many years 
furnish a beautiful flower-like creature for the pro- 
tagonist of "A Girl of the Blue Ridge" (Little, 
Brown & Co.), whose development from a wild and 
primitive savagery to beautiful wifehood and moth- 
erhood is the theme of a good story. Lury Bab, at 
the opening of the tale, is as wild and as beautiful 
in her youth as a rhododendron blossom, the child 
of a lovely and self-sacrificing mother and a father 
who lives by distilling illicit whiskey. Orphaned at 
the beginning of the book, she gives her love to a 
young man who is wrongfully accused of her 
father's murder. Benevolent sisters from the North 
come to live near by, and under their care she 
develops to fine things. It is a story of skilfully 
contrived plot and incident, written out of full 
knowledge. 

By a somewhat strained coincidence the daughter 
by adoption of a New York multimillionaire and a 
popular novelist find themselves teaching in the 
same school in Pennsylvania. She is seeking an 
independent career outside the fashionable world 
for herself; he is after material for a new Amer- 
ican novel. This is the basis for " Martha of the 
Mennonite Country" (Doubleday), the latest of 
Mrs. Helen R. Martin's novels dealing with an 
exotic civilization in the heart of one of the origi- 
nal colonies. The heroine of the story, however, is 
not the rich girl from the metropolis, but a sadly 
oppressed young woman, worked to death by a 
hateful stepmother. It is with this last disagreeable 
person that the novelist-teacher boards, and it is 
between the stepdaughter and him that the romance 
of the book works out, though the rich girl, after 
the manner of rich girls, does not go neglected. 

With something of the invincible spirit of her 
own Miss Abigail, Miss Dorothy Canfield brings her 
literary gifts to the celebration of the small town 
in the book which she calls " Hillsboro People " 
(Holt). To that end she marshals no fewer than 
eighteen incidents and episodes and essays, rein- 
forced by several poems on Vermont by Mrs. Sarah 
N. Cleghorn. The full flavor of New England is in 
them all, leaving the city dweller with a sense of 
impatience that he is denied intercourse with men 
and women, boys and girls, of so much personality 
and character. Most of us are only a generation or 
two removed from much such a life as is here 
painted in delicate colors, and the zest of it is still 
in our minds. This is an excellent collection of 
American stories.

[May 13 



Among recent novels which leave one the better 
at heart for having read them, " Contrary Mary " 
(Penn Publishing Co.), by Miss Temple Bailey, 
deserves honorable mention. The heroine is a young 
woman of ideas and determination, who is not 
afraid of admiring men for their manly qualities. 
Her family fortunes are at a low ebb so low that 
she welcomes into her household a widowed clerk in 
government employment who has lost heart in his 
struggle with the world. How she brings him to a 
realization of the need for fighting honorably for 
his real place among men, rejecting a most eligible 
suitor meanwhile, makes excellent reading. The 
scene is laid in Washington, with politics far in the 
background. 

Miss Alice Gerstenberg's novel, " The Conscience 
of Sarah Platt" (McClurg), is redolent of femin- 
ism and modern problems arising between the sexes 
so much so that it rather ceases to be a novel at 
times. It is the story of a timid woman who failed 
to gain the man she loved in youth, only to meet 
him and give him her heart when he returned to 
her, an ill-mated husband, twenty-five years later. 
Tragedy, when the conscience is developed, is inher- 
ent in the situation. The narrative is open to a 
lawyer's charge of multifariousness, and its mate- 
rial is imperfectly assimilated. But it holds out 
abundant promise for future success. 

It was hardly to be expected that the reader 
should be thrilled by "Allan and the Holy Flower " 
(Longmans) as he was years ago by Mr. H. Rider 
Haggard's early tales of Africa and Allan Quater- 
main. But nevertheless, this latest story of adven- 
ture shows no diminution of imagination. Interest 
here centres about a wonderful orchid, the father 
of all orchids, which is worshipped by a dwindling 
African tribe as a god. The story of how it was 
won through events teeming with peril, how it was 
lost in the moment of seeming success, and how the 
loss was eventually made good, makes an exciting 
tale. 

Taking the final campaign before Napoleon's 
exile to Elba and that following his return down 
through Waterloo, the Rev. Cyrus Townsend Brady 
makes a vivid and stirring romance, " The Eagle of 
the Empire " (Doran) , which is in keeping with the 
events of the age. The hero is an officer of the 
Fifth of the Line, the heroine a daughter of the 
noble house he and his family have served through 
generations. Young Marteau saves her from worse 
than death, to find a rival in a young English soldier 
of station. The romance threads the historical 
events with considerable skill, and the result is a 
story fully absorbing and workmanlike. 

A sequel to " Uncle Terry " has been written by 
Mr. Charles Clark Munn and called " The Heart of 
Uncle Terry " (Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co.). The 
discovery of a pocket of tourmalines on the prop- 
erty of the old lighthouseman brings success to a 
young man, deprived of most of his heritage by his 
step-mother, and lends interest to the winning of 
the old fellow's adopted daughter. It is a homely 
tale of New England, with the Yankee's desire to 
get the better of somebody rather too strongly 
insisted upon. 



BRIEFS ox XE\V BOOKS. 



Artists have painted the Golden 
State, naturalists have described 
the wonders of her mountains 
and forests, historians have wrought out the 
tales of her padres and argonauts, enterprising 
boomers have flooded the marts of the conti- 
nent with glowing accounts of her fertility and 
her charms ; but it has remained for the poet 
really to portray her inner secrets. This is 
accomplished by Mr. Edwin Markham, in his 
" California the Wonderful " (Hearst Co.) . It 
is no new tale of heroic endeavor or unflagging 
enterprise, no revelation of hitherto undiscov- 
ered resources, no unfrequented vista explored 
for the first time ; but rather, that greatest of 
all revelations, a human document portraying 
the subtile, conquering, compelling charm 
which California exerts over her adopted sons. 
Mr. Markham's book lives up to its sub-title. 
" her romantic history, her picturesque people, 
her wild shores, her desert mystery, her valley 
loveliness, her mountain glory, including her 
varied resources, her commercial greatness, 
her intellectual achievements, her expanding 
hopes, with glimpses of Oregon and Washing- 
ton, her northern neighbors." The work is 
very comprehensive ; Mr. Markham deals with 
the whole of the great state, not the south- 
land only, as do many tourist writers ; he goes 
far back into the gray antiquity of the creative 
fates for the drama of the " vast inf ramundane 
activity " which gave birth to the Sierras and 
the Mother Lode. He traces the entrance of 
the Spaniard, and the inauguration of his 
scheme of Divine Practicalism to redeem the 
slothful and backward Indian from damnation 
and degeneracy. He relates the mad rush of 
gold-seekers which forever wiped "maiiana" 
from the calendar, put the gringo in the saddle 
of the Spanish cavalier, and ended the pastoral 
era. His accounts of the overland trail and of 
the days of '49 are particularly vivid and real- 
istic, for his own boyhood days were a part of 
that great drama. The same intimate contact 
with the California of yesterday and to-day is 
revealed in his pages recounting the rapidly 
changing development of her industries and 
agriculture, the transformation of untilled. 
ranch into the orchard watered by mountain 
snows, the marvellously successful growth of 
cooperative enterprise, the redemption of the 
desert, the story of alfalfa, and the welding 
into one people of the most cosmopolitan group 
of American citizens. The author is at his best 
in his poetic but pithy description of the gray- 
draped city of St. Francis, a city which " has 
an individuality, a glamour that has stirred 
the imagination of the world, the ultimate out- 
post of the passion of progress." The book is

unique also in its comprehensive and critical 
estimate of intellectual California, in the gal- 
axy of which the author himself is no minor 
luminary. The poetic turns, the vivid and illu- 
minating imagery of the language, and the 
flowing rhythm of these pages are a worthy 
tribute to the beauty and romance of Cali- 
fornia. 

charter making In his "Municipal Charters: A 
for American Discussion of the Essentials 01 

municipalities. Forms or 



Models for Adoption" (Harvard University 
Press), Mr. Nathan Matthews has provided 
framers of municipal constitutions and stu- 
dents of municipal government with a con- 
venient and practical handbook of charter 
making. The author is an ex-mayor of Boston, 
past chairman of the Boston Finance Com- 
mission, and lecturer on municipal govern- 
ment in Harvard University. There are few 
men in the United States whose knowledge of 
the theory of municipal government is so 
abundantly supplemented and tempered by 
prolonged experience in city administration. 
The principal thesis of Mr. Matthews 's book, 
namely, that municipal charters in the United 
States are, as a rule, poorly drawn, and that 
good government in a city presupposes a 
charter of proper proportions and precision, 
is not difficult to maintain. The tendency has 
been very general to overload charters with 
details, although the principal defect in some 
instances is rather the lack of detail. Dis- 
proportionate space is often given to certain 
subjects, and more recent charters exhibit 
especially the fault of over-emphasis upon 
political machinery, while administrative 
methods receive inadequate attention. There 
is too much hasty re-enactment and copying 
of the provisions of earlier charters, or of the 
charters of other cities, whereby defects as 
well as virtues are perpetuated and spread. 
There is little uniformity of language or 
arrangement, and there is commonly an un- 
necessary amount of repetition. The two 
principles, chiefly, which it is insisted should 
govern in the making of city charters are (1) 
that all matters which affect citizens of the 
State as such, rather than as members of a 
particular city, should be left to be controlled 
through general legislation, rather than in the 
city charter; and (2) that the political fea- 
tures of a charter should not be permitted to 
overshadow, or imperil the operation of, the 
more important provisions relating to the 
administration of the city business. Hundreds 
of city charters, it is affirmed, have brought 
disappointment to their authors because their 
administrative provisions have been inade- 
quate. "Simplicity of political structure, 



accompanied by thoroughness in the admin- 
istrative details, must be the basis of charter 
reform." The volume closes with full drafts 
of city charters of two leading kinds, namely, 
the responsible executive type and the com- 
mission type. 



The future 
granary of 
the world. 



The latent and as yet scarcely 
developed resources of Russia's 
great Hinterland challenge the 
interest of the reader of Dr. Fridtjof Nan- 
sen's "Through Siberia: The Land of the 
Future" (Stokes), and lead him to speculate 
as to the possibilities of the influence of this 
storehouse of food for the civilized world 
when once transportation shall flood the mar- 
kets of the continent with its meat, fish, and 
grain. Already 140,000 tons of Siberian but- 
ter go annually to London and Paris. The 
aim of Dr. Nansen's tour across the Kara Sea 
and up the Yenesei was to test out the possi- 
bility of a steamship route in midsummer 
which would connect with river steamers on 
the Yenesei and thus afford an outlet to the 
markets of Europe for the produce of Sibe- 
rian farms. Russian colonization in Siberia 
since the Russo-Japanese War has been fos- 
tered by the Government, and has grown so 
rapidly that the question of transportation 
and markets is pressing for solution. The 
author advocates scientific surveys of the ad- 
jacent Arctic waters, the extension of the 
wireless services, and the use of aeroplanes to 
give prompt information of the opening of 
navigation, and of the location of ice lanes 
for the guidance of mariners who will use this 
sea route from Europe to the estuaries of the 
Obi and Yenesei, a route little used but long 
known to hardy Norse skippers. He contin- 
ued his journey along the Trans-Siberian 
Railway to the Pacific at Vladivostok, re- 
turning through the new Russian line in the 
Amur country. His book thus gives a bird's- 
eye view of "this boundless land, mighty as 
the ocean itself, with its infinite plains and 
mountains, its frozen Arctic coast, its free and 
desolate tundra, its deep, mysterious taiga, 
from the Ural to the Pacific, its grass grown 
rolling steppes, its purple wooded hills, and 
its little scattered patches of human life." 
The agricultural and mining possibilities, the 
political and social problems, the economic 
and industrial aspects of Siberia are here 
summed up by a trained scientific mind 
keenly alert to the significance of the passing 
landscape, the mushroom towns of the chang- 
ing frontier, and the invading yellow hordes 
of Coreans and Chinese increasing in the 
East, from sixteen to twenty-four per cent of 
total population in less than four years. The

author has no fear that the colonization of 
this inland empire will lead to the deteriora- 
tion of the Russian stock, as it did to that of 
Rome and Spain and now threatens that of 
Great Britain. The contiguity of the land, 
the great mass of the Russian population, and 
the easy transfer of the Russian culture intact 
to these new lands all seem to insure the in- 
tegrity of the Russian nation and people in 
this expansion to the East. Her mission here 
is, so this veteran explorer believes, to be the 
bulwark of Europe against the "Yellow 
Peril." Maps and a large number of excel- 
lent illustrations from photographs make even 
more real this illuminating picture of this 
future granary of the world. 

An iconoclastic Tt is difficult to understand the 
study of Lowell intellectual temper of a student 
of literature who devotes an 
entire volume to showing the deficiencies of an 
author ; it is more difficult still when he bases 
his attack on the denial of qualities which 
perhaps no discriminating reader ever imag- 
ined the author possessed. Yet this is what 
Dr. Joseph J. Reilly has done in " James Rus- 
sell Lowell as a Critic " (Putnam). It is true 
that Lowell, after his enthusiastic recognition 
in England, was sometimes over-praised, and 
sometimes praised for the wrong things. But 
his greatest admirers have always been those 
who felt the charm of his personality, and 
who read his critical essays as the personal 
comments of one who knew literature and 
knew life, and who was above all a charming 
and high-souled man. It needs no elaborate 
series of citations to inform these readers that 
the essays are often whimsical, discursive, and 
rambling, or that they abound in contradic- 
tions arising from the approach to a subject 
from different angles, or from the discussion 
of the same subject in different moods. In 
Lowell's life-time, indeed, these contradictions 
troubled critics to whom consistency was a 
hobgoblin, and several of those emphasized by 
Dr. Reilly are found in Wilkinson's list pub- 
lished more than forty years ago. Nor will 
the most grateful readers of Lowell deny Dr. 
Reilly's other chief theses that " his taste 
was intuitive," that " he lacked philosophical 
depth of mind," and that he did not evolve a 
critical method like that of Arnold and Sainte- 
Beuve. Dr. Reilly cites passages to show that 
Lowell himself was fully aware of most or all 
of these limitations. The conclusion that 
Lowell was not a critic begs the question with 
a definition, and can only mean that Lowell 
was not a sort of critic that he never claimed 
to be and that his closest readers never imag- 
ined him to be. The book is, throughout, un- 



sympathetic in tone, and sometimes seems 
unfair in its interpretation of Lowell's per- 
sonality; but the author takes such evident 
joy in demolishing his man of straw that not 
even Lowell's most enthusiastic friends could 
grudge him the pleasure.

The firSt fe . W P a ^ 6S f Mr> 

Harold Begbic's little book on 
Kitchener, Organizer of Vic- 
tory " (Houghton) may lead the reader to con- 
clude that it is merely a piece of laudatory 
writing with no substance or value as a biog- 
raphy. In part this is true: Mr. Begbie's 
book is in no sense a biography, it is a mere 
sketch of Kitchener's career, written appar- 
ently for the purpose of accounting for the 
great faith that Englishmen seem to have in 
the present occupant of the war-office. The 
sketch is not very laudatory, however, and the 
praise that Mr. Begbie does award his hero is 
of such a character that even a modest man 
like Lord Kitchener is not likely to be pleased 
with it. The author describes his hero as a 
slow, heavy, somewhat dull man, with great 
talents as an administrator, but otherwise not 
possessed of striking abilities. " Kitchener is 
by no means, for instance, a great general. 
Again, his statesmanship has never advanced 
out of gun range, because it is entirely without 
the genius that trusts humanity. In conse- 
quence he is something of a bungler, something 
of a blunderer." The general's present posi- 
tion is due to what Mr. Begbie calls the 
" Kitchener legend," to which he devotes a 
chapter. The Kitchener legend, he tells us, 
grew out of the work of a brilliant newspaper 
correspondent, who in a London paper " de- 
scribed the famous march to Khartoum, filling 
the grey commercial atmosphere of London 
with the rich colours of the East, with the 
exciting adventure of war, and with the still 
more exciting sensation of anxiety." It seems 
to be Mr. Begbie's opinion that this legendary 
character is far -more useful in the present 
crisis than the real Kitchener, as it gives the 
English public the confidence in the govern- 
ment that is needed above everything else. 
The volume is illustrated with eight photo- 
graphs of Lord Kitchener taken at various 
periods of life and in various costumes, civil, 
military, Oriental, and academic.

had a varied and valuable experience in the 
land about which he writes, but also brings to 
bear sound methods of investigation and pre- 
sentation, with the natural result that he has 
given us a thoughtful and useful volume. 
After a brief but serviceable historical out- 
line, he enters upon a discussion of the " Move- 
ments Favoring Vigorous Reform," such as the 
Brahma Samaj. Then he turns to "Reform 
Checked by Defence of the Old Faiths," and 
under this general caption he writes about the 
Arya Samaj, the Vedic Mission, and nine simi- 
lar movements. In the fourth chapter he treats 
of the " Full Defence of the Old Religions," 
with such subdivisions as Sectarian Move- 
ments in Hinduism, the Parsees, Sectarian 
Universities, and so forth. However, for most 
readers the two most attractive and suggestive 
chapters will prove to be those on " Religious 
Nationalism " and " Social Reform and Ser- 
vice," not because they are more carefully writ- 
ten than the others, but from the nature of 
their subjects. In these sections, and indeed 
in all, Mr. Farquhar insists that there has been 
a steady advance of the old faiths, and that 
all the reformation and revivification has been 
due essentially to Christianity: "While the 
shaping forces here, have been many, Chris- 
tianity has ruled the development through- 
out." (Italics in the text.) Naturally this is 
a large question, which we may not discuss; 
but it assuredly is one that every student of 
world history must find absorbingly interest- 
ing. We have just one serious complaint 
against our author, and that is for wasting so 
many pages on his circumstantial exposure of 
the frauds of Madame Blavatsky and some of 
the other Theosophists. Of course his arraign- 
ment is most convincing; but these vapid 
iniquities needed no further flaying for the 
class of readers to whom the present volume 
will appeal, and the space thus squandered 
might have been utilized for a more extended 
treatment of the " Servants of India Society/' 
for instance, or half a dozen other interest- 
ing and significant topics. The illustrations, 
chiefly portraits, are excellent. 



The story of 

Belgium's 

martyrdom. 



Dr. Charles Sarolea, who has for 
twelve years been Belgian con- 
sul in Edinburgh, has written 
movingly of the martyrdom of his native land 
in a book entitled, " How Belgium Saved Eu- 
rope " (Lippincott). Americans, to whom the 
German invasion of that busy and contented 
land is the great unforgettable and unforgiv- 
able fact of the war, will read with absorbed 
interest this plain unvarnished tale which 



needs neither exaggeration nor rhetoric to 
bring it home to men's bosoms. The author 
writes with restraint, though his indignation 
at times comes close to the surface. Having 
been himself an eye-witness of the first four 
weeks of the war, he is able to describe vividly 
those momentous operations around Liege, 
Malines, and Namur which had such a far- 
reaching effect on the whole Western cam- 
paign. It is his profound conviction that Bel- 
gium has fought in defence not only of her 
own independence but also of the liberties of 
Europe and the sanctity of international law. 
In strict honor she was not bound to resist to 
the bitter end. After the first defence had been 
broken down, she might well have concluded 
an armistice with the enemy and thereby have 
tried to save herself from the horrors of a Ger- 
man occupation. In so doing she would have 
fulfilled her treaty obligations and have satis- 
fied the dictates of honor. But with a lofty 
political idealism and a touch of that mystical 
temper which we see in her great writers 
Maeterlinck and Verhaeren, she chose to lay 
down her life for her friends. She did not 
even complain when the Allies failed to come 
to her aid in time. Dr. Sarolea is fully cog- 
nizant now of the reasons for that failure, 
the lack of preparation and the French tacti- 
cal blunder in attempting a premature thrust 
in Alsace ; but he points out that at the time 
the delay not only made the Belgians heart- 
sick with deferred hope but also seriously up- 
set their military plans. The author himself 
witnessed certain German atrocities, which he 
describes without comment, preferring to 
dwell on officially authorized instances of ter- 
rorism, such as the destruction of Louvain and 
Dinant. 

A satire and some Mr - Henry Arthur Jones, the 
one-act plays by veteran English playwright, has 
commemorated his last winter's 
visit to the United States by the publication 
of three one-act plays and a burlesque narra- 
tive, in a volume called " The Theatre of 
Ideas" (Doran). The little dramas have all 
the ready cleverness of technique that Mr. 
Jones's long practical experience with the 
stage has perfected. Their reader will not 
expect or find in them much stimulus in the 
way of thought, or much revelation of new 
methods in character study (although in the 
brief Cornish tragedy, " Grace Mary," there is 
real human feeling beneath the banal story) ; 
their author has lived through his experi- 
mental period, and shows himself here as an 
accomplished craftsman rather than as an un- 
wearied and growing artist. Indeed, in the 
burlesque which gives the book its title, he 
reveals himself quite definitely and intention-

ally as the good-naturedly cynical foe of the 
intensely self-conscious younger school of 
dramatists who study parliamentary Blue- 
Books to find material for their plays and who 
seem to Mr. Jones to be merely rocking ener- 
getically back and forth on a hobby Pegasus 
and hacking wildly with blunt wooden swords 
at whatever ancient convention or human tra- 
dition comes within reach of their arms. 
Universal suffrage, universal peace, universal 
panaceas of all sorts, he mocks in a serio- 
comic style, so much heavier than witty in its 
general effect that it hardly prepares one for 
the swift concluding explosion that wrecks 
the Theatre of Ideas, the School attached to 
it, and all its votaries. The ridicule is neither 
bitter nor pointed enough to leave a sting ; its 
neutral tone is perhaps but the inevitable re- 
flection of the American atmosphere in which 
Mr. Jones conceived and wrote it as a half- 
jesting expression of some of the follies he 
hopes to see destroyed by the Great War. 

studies in The volume of ' ' Canadian Essays 

Canadian politics and Addresses " (Longmans), by 

and education. T i T> j. j - /-* -11 

Principal Peterson of McGill 
University, Montreal, is divided into two 
broad sections: the first dealing with Canada's 
external relations, and the second devoted to 
educational questions. The addresses on Im- 
perialism, Canada's Naval Policy, her rela- 
tions with the rest of the Empire, and with 
the United States, have an immediate interest 
in this period of world-wide upheaval. Prin- 
cipal Peterson is an Imperialist, but not in 
any narrow sense. The federation of the 
British Empire he looks forward to is one that 
will make for mutual understanding and help- 
fulness among its scattered members, without 
the sacrifice of any essential principles of self- 
government. No intelligent onlooker can very 
well doubt that one of the better products of 
this disastrous war will be a readjustment of 
the relations between Canada and the other 
self-governing Dominions and the Mother 
Land. The part Canada, Australia, and New 
Zealand are taking in the war, and the sig- 
nificant utterances of responsible statesmen 
both in England and in the Overseas Do- 
minions, make it clear that some means will 
be found of giving the outlying portions of 
the British Empire a voice in all questions of 
foreign policy, and all matters affecting the 
Empire as a whole. In the second division of 
his book, Dr. Peterson discusses, from the 
point of view of a broad-minded and experi- 
enced educationalist, such vital questions as 
"National Education," "The Place of the 
University in the Commercial City," "Educa- 
tion and Business," and the "Claims of Clas- 
sical Studies in Modern Education." 



A roiling stone Autobiography anonymously 
that gathered written brings up some curious 
questions of psychology. The 
author must feel that his career is interesting 
to the general public, or he would not describe 
it; yet he seeks to avoid the fame his book 
might bring him, perhaps for the sake of 
greater freedom in telling the story of his life. 
" Getting a Wrong Start " (Macmillan) first 
appeared as a serial in the most popular of 
American weeklies a year ago. Then, as now, 
the author's name was not disclosed. But there 
is manifestly only one American writer whose 
life fits into the facts here revealed. That 
writer is Mr. Emerson Hough, whose biog- 
raphy in " Who's Who in America " checks up 
in detail with the present book. The title of 
the volume indicates that the writer believes 
himself to have begun life badly. The reader 
may differ from him with abundant justifica- 
tion. He tried a number of things, in our 
national manner, before he discovered his fit- 
ness for authorship, law and journalism 
among them. In this way he served his ap- 
prenticeship, working hard and intelligently. 
When he came to the age of forty he wrote his 
first fiction. Since that time and he is now 
in his fifty-eighth year his success has been 
marked; so marked indeed, that what he re- 
gards as a warning may well serve as an exam- 
ple. Especially interesting is his account of 
his marriage and wedded life ; this, too, seems 
to justify the wisdom of arriving at full matur- 
ity before plunging. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Two volumes recently added to the " Handy Vol- 
ume Classics" (Crowell) are "The Twelve Best 
Tales by English Writers," selected by Mr. Adam 
L. Gowans, and " The Best English and Scottish 
Ballads," selected by Mr. Edward A. Bryant. In 
both volumes the selections are discriminating ; and 
the titles are useful additions to a convenient and 
inexpensive series. 

For the busy teacher or mother, Dr. William 
Byron Forbush's " Manual of Play " (Jacobs) con- 
tains many practical suggestions for free play 
among children which will prove stimulating and 
helpful. Complete directions for a large number of 
games are included. Throughout the volume runs 
a note of faith in the value of keeping alive the 
play-spirit among the adults to whom is entrusted 
the guidance of the child. 

Mr. H. Addington Bruce lias put together a series 
of detached and superficial essays under the irrele- 
vant title of " Psychology and Parenthood " 
(Dodd) . Skimming along the " popular " waves of 
interest in defective or precocious children, in hys- 
teria and fear, in theories of laughter, of the sub- 
conscious, and of the genesis of genius, the book is 
made by culling- the most sensational aspects of the

unusual cases. It contains material useful and use- 
less, correct and false, pertinent and impertinent; 
it is uncritical in treatment and weak in motive. 
Such books may do some good by stimulating inter- 
est and more harm by satisfying it. 

In " Discoveries and Inventions of the Twentieth 
Century" (Button), Mr. Edward Cressy has pre- 
pared a useful companion volume to Routledge's 
popular manual covering the same field for the 
preceding century. So rapid has been the increase 
of scientific activity that considerations of space 
have led Mr. Cressy to modify in part the plan of 
the original and to select for his non-technical dis- 
cussions only the characteristic results of inventive 
enterprise during the last twenty-five years. While 
the book is adapted to the needs of the many rather 
than of the specialist, the author, with judicious 
discrimination, has given to each topic a far more 
comprehensive account than is usually found in 
handbooks prepared for the " average man." 

In "The True Ulysses S. Grant" (Lippincott) , 
General Charles King has undertaken to digest 
for the general reader the enormous amount of 
biographical literature devoted to the career of 
General Grant. The result is a very well-written 
biography, in which the narrative of military 
affairs is related in untechnical fashion and is 
wisely subordinated to the account of Grant's life 
taken as a whole. Throughout the book there runs 
a frank hero-worship, for which the critical reader 
must make kindly allowance. Especially will this 
consideration be demanded in that brief part of the 
work which treats of Grant's two terms as Prest 
dent, and in the chapter which tells of his relations 
with Andrew Johnson. The plan of the series in 
which the volume appears permits no footnotes, 
and there is no attempt at a bibliography ; but there 
is a good index, and the work is well illustrated. 

The perplexing allusion, such as one so often 
encounters in Lowell's learned page or Matthew 
Arnold's polished essay, will always be with us, or 
at least until writers choose to make their style as 
bald and unattractive as that of a textbook on 
arithmetic or geography. Hence the need of such 
books as Miss Florence M. Hopkins's " Allusions, 
Words, and Phrases that Should be Known, and 
Where to Find Them," a revised and improved 
edition of her earlier "Allusions Which Every 
High School Student Should Know." Nearly fifty 
pages of not uncommon though not too obvious 
allusions, with indications of easily accessible 
sources of information concerning them, have been 
carefully prepared, and each printed page is faced 
by a blank one for additional entries on the stu- 
dent's part. It is encouraging to learn from the 
author that she has been induced by the reception 
of her former work to prepare this second and 
more maturely considered treatise in the same field. 
Our younger writers betray their rawness (if that 
be not too harsh a term) in nothing so much as the 
thinness, the poverty, the unallusiveness of their 
style. Miss Hopkins is librarian of the Detroit 
Central High School, and her book may be had of 
the Willard Company, of that city. She has in 
preparation a work on " Reference Guides That 
Should be Known." 



Mr. Frank Harris's " Contemporary Portraits " 
will be published next month by Mr. Mitchell 
Kennerley. 

A play by Mr. Louis J. Block, entitled " The 
Judge," is soon to be published by The Gorham 
Press of Boston. 

" Michael O'Halloran " is the title of Mrs. Gene 
Stratton-Porter's new novel which will be issued in 
August by Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. 

A new edition of M. Maeterlinck's " Three Little 
Dramas for Marionettes " is promised for early 
publication. The volume has been out of print for 
several years. 

Sir Gilbert Parker has completed his book on the 
making and conduct of the war, and it will probably 
be ready next month under the title of " The World 
in the Crucible." 

Mr. J. A. Fuller-Maitland's new work, " The 
Consort of Music : A Study of Interpretation and 
Ensemble," will be published by the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press in a few weeks. 

" The Dawn," a play by the Belgian poet M. 
Emile Verhaeren, will appear this month in a spe- 
cial edition from the press of Messrs. Small, 
Maynard & Co. The volume will contain an intro- 
duction by Mr. Arthur Syrnons. 

Among the May publications of Messrs. Doran 
are " The Invisible Event," the concluding volume 
of the Jacob Stahl trilogy by Mr. J. D. Beresford, 
" The Rat-pit," by Mr. Patrick MacGill, and " The 
Lie," a one-act play by Mr. Henry Arthur Jones. 

Something of the warm attachment that existed 
between the two highly gifted brothers, Sidney and 
Clifford A. Lanier, is said to be revealed in a vol- 
ume of verse by the latter, which will be published 
under the title of " Sonnets to Sidney Lanier, and 
Other Lyrics." 

As a result of the welcome which M. Artziba- 
shef's novel " Sanine " has received in this country, 
Mr. B. W. Huebsch has arranged to bring out all 
of this author's fiction. The next volume to appear 
will be " The Millionaire," containing one short and 
two long stories. 

The sixth volume of the illustrated edition of 
Macaulay's "History of England," which Messrs. 
Macmillan will have ready this month, completes 
a work which has been appearing quarterly under 
the editorship of Professor C. H. Firth since 
November, 1913. 

It is impossible to foresee the influence of the 
great war on English literature in the future. Some 
of the precedents are dealt with by Professor E. 
de Selincourt in a volume of lectures about to be 
published by the Oxford University Press under the 
title of " English Poets and the National Ideal." 

Mr. Balfour's Gifford lectures on " Theism and 
Humanity " will be ready for publication shortly. 
Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton received the complete 
manuscript from Mr. Balfour a short time ago, and 
they anticipate that even in these stirring times the 
book will give rise to a good deal of discussion.

Immediately forthcoming volumes in the " Home 
University Library " are : " Belgium," by Mr. 
R. C. K. Ensor; "A History of Philosophy," by 
Mr. Clement C. J. Webb; "Political Thought: 
From Herbert Spencer to the Present Day," by 
Mr. Ernest Baker; " Milton," by Mr. John Bailey; 
and " The Negro," by Mr. W. E. B. Du Bois. 

Two noteworthy volumes of impressions and 
experiences of the European war are soon to be 
published in Mr. Will Irwin's " Men, Women, and 
War " and Mr. Frederick Palmer's " Personal 
Phases of the War." Mr. Irwin started for the 
war three days after it broke out, returning in 
November to organize the Commission for Relief 
in Belgium. 

More than two hundred confidential military 
dispatches to President Jefferson Davis from 
General Robert E. Lee, which historians feared 
were hopelessly lost but which have been brought 
to light by Mr. Wymberley Jones De Renne of 
Georgia, are to be issued this month by Messrs. 
Putnam. The volume is edited by Dr. Douglas 
Southall Freeman. 

Mr. and Mrs. Joseph PennelFs book on lithog- 
raphy, soon to be published, contains chapters on 
the history of the art by Mrs. Pennell, together with 
a description and technical explanations of modern 
artistic methods by Mr. Pennell, and is elaborately 
illustrated. The historical portion of the book is 
founded upon the volume by Mr. and Mrs. Pennell 
issued in 1898, and long out of print, but the book 
is new though based upon the old. 

A critical edition of " The Poetical Works of 
Robert Herrick," edited by Dr. F. W. Moorman, 
will shortly be added to the " Oxford English 
Texts" series. In the present edition Dr. Moor- 
man has been able to use the copy of " Hesperides " 
in the possession of Mr. G. C. Macaulay, which 
gives the text as revised by the poet in the printing 
office. Those poems by Herrick are also included 
which do not find a place in the 1648 volume. 

The need of fire-proof structures for valuable 
libraries received another lamentable illustration on 
the 26th of last month, when a lively blaze in the 
basement of the St. Paul Public Library caused the 
ruin, as is reported, of the large collection of books 
(100,000 volumes, valued at $150,000) sheltered by 
that building. Water, more than fire, did the actual 
damage, as is so often the case in similar instances. 
The total loss to the city is estimated at $300,000. 

In a prefatory note to his forthcoming English 
edition of Dr. Sven Hedin's "With the German 
Armies in the West," Mr. John Lane replies to his 
critics and states his reasons for publishing the 
work in England. The book, which is expected 
shortly, has already been parodied by Mr. E. V. 
Lucas in a little book entitled " In Gentlest Ger- 
many," with illustrations by Mr. George Morrow. 
This will appear shortly after the publication of 
Sven Hetlin's volume. 

Three forthcoming publications of Messrs. 
Houghton Mifflin Co. not previously announced 
are " Bronson Alcott's Fruitlands," a compilation 
by Clara Endicott Sears of all the writings on the 



subject of Bronson Alcott's community at Fruit- 
lands; "Whither?" the anonymous essay which 
attracted wide and earnest comment when it ap- 
peared in the March number of the "Atlantic";, 
and " Naval Occasions," by " Bartimeus," present- 
ing a series of vivid pictures of the life at sea of 
the officers and men of the British navy. 

Literary workers and peace advocates will be 
interested in a prize contest instituted by the 
Christian Women's Peace Movement, which enlists 
women of all denominations and claims a con- 
stituency of four millions. A prize of one hundred 
dollars is offered for a short story, not to exceed 
four thousand words in length, setting forth Chris- 
tian ideals of peace. The manuscript should be 
typewritten on one side of the sheet only, and must 
be in hand not later than June 15. Competitors, 
should address the Christian AVomen's Peace Move- 
ment, 705 Ford Building, Boston, enclosing stamps- 
for return of their manuscripts if found unavail- 
able. 

In a forthcoming book entitled " Shelley in En- 
gland," Mr. Roger Ingpen utilizes information re- 
vealed since the publication of Professor Dowden's 
biography of the poet as to Shelley's early life. 
More especially has the author availed himself of a 
mass of unpublished matter recently disclosed relat- 
ing to the poet and his family, including twenty- 
six new letters of Shelley. The volume contains a 
transcript of Shelley's manuscript note-book, which, 
water-stained and tattered, was recovered from the 
"Ariel," the boat in which he met his death. The 
illustrations include some family and other por- 
traits reproduced for the first time, as well as fac- 
similes from the manuscript note-book. 

Some unpublished letters of Charles Darwin, 
throwing many side-lights on the more intimate 
details of his life, are included in the memoirs of 
his wife, entitled " Emma Darwin : A Century of 
Family Letters, 1792-1896," edited by her daughter, 
Henrietta Litchfield, which will be published in two- 
illustrated volumes. The first volume chiefly con- 
sists of the letters written by Mrs. Darwin's mother^ 
Mrs. Josiah Wedgwood, and her sisters, now linked 
together and edited to complete a picture of the 
country life of an English family in the first half 
of the nineteenth century. The life and letters of 
Mrs. Darwin complete a work which was originally 
written for her grandchildren, and was privately 
printed in 1904. 

Mr. Allen Upward's new book, " Paradise 
Found," which Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. will' 
publish this month, is a critical extravaganza in 
dialogue form which is essentially a searching criti- 
cism of Mr. Bernard Shaw and his ideas. The plot 
of the piece is this: Shaw, through enchantment, 
is cast into a trance, and in this form is preserved 1 
by his followers as a sacred relic for two hundred 1 
years. At the expiration of two centuries, he is 
awakened by a kiss into a world administered* 
entirely on Shavian principles. The re-awakened 
Shaw's disgust with the practical operation of his- 
ideas is developed with much humor; but the 
reader finds when he is through that the Shavian 
philosophy has received a searching and at many 
points a destructive criticism.

"// is the equal of the bat English quarterlies 
and continues to grow better with each issue, and 
the greatest literary enjoyment any man could 
desire would be that the Review be a monthly 
instead of a quarterly." 

Other readers, though perhaps none more 
gracefully, have requested more frequent publica- 
tion of The Yale Review. We believe, however, 
that as a rule the modern reader of periodical 
literature wants on the one hand frequent discus- 
sions of current events and books, and on the 
other, longer articles of a more reflective sort, 
published not too frequently. The next issues of 
the reading we wish to linger over should not come 
upon us too rapidly, and the articles they contain 
should be especially worth-while, with a freshness 
and significance especially long-lived. 

The Yale Review is designed for those thou- 
sands of intelligent readers who desire to under- 
stand as fully as may be the scope and significance 
of the burning questions of to-day and who wish 
at the same time to enjoy articles of permanent 
literary character. Its nearly one thousand annual 
pages are assembled in four numbers, printed in 
large attractive type on imported Esparto feather- 
weight paper. The subscription price is $2.50 a year. 

A specimen copy, a 1915 prospectus and a synopsis of 
the current (April) contents will gladly be sent upon 
the request of prospective friends and readers of

Miss Viola Roseboro', to whom is credited the 
discovery of O. Henry and the acceptance of his 
first work, is now associated withTHE EDITOR, 
the fortnightly journal of information for literary 
workers, as critic and adviser. In his autobiogra- 
phy S. S. McClure says : "Miss Roseboro' seized 
upon the early stories of O. Henry, Jack London, 
Myra Kelly, Rex Beach and on the Emmy Lou 
stories with as much sureness of conviction as if 
she had known what the end was to be in each 
case, and exactly how popular each of these writers

The Only American Text- Book on the Subject 




and Its Auxiliary Branches 

THIS work, the first and only complete text-book in this country that covers 
the subject in all its phases, will prove of great interest and value to every one 
connected directly or indirectly with bookbinding. 

John J. Pleger, the author, is an advanced exponent of the art, and has given 
the trade, in concise, comprehensive form, the benefit of his broad knowledge. 

The smaller printer who has to do binding as a side line will find herein a 
mine of helpful information. 

It will be found invaluable by the larger binders when the time comes for 
purchasing additional or new equipment. 

To the involuntary specialist the man whose limitations have tied him to one 
operation it will prove a boon in widening his opportunities for better employ- 
ment and remuneration. 

Librarians and others intrusted with the "care" of books will find Mr. 
Pleger's offering well worth attention.

EXTRACTS FROM SOME OF THE LETTERS 
MR. PLEGER HAS RECEIVED: 

"The writer has personally enjoyed reading the works and 
congratulates you upon the thoroughness with which you 
have covered the subject." 

"Students, apprentices and novices who are interested in 
the different branches of bookbinding will find it a very 
simple matter to learn and perfect themselves from these 
volumes, full of illustrated examples. The printer and 
librarian will find it valuable beyond their expectations." 

"They are thorough 'and lucidly-written text-books, 
which will benefit the more expert workmen as well as 
learners. They will be of especial value to printers who 
operate binding departments and have to rely upon others 
for their management.. I know of no other text-book of 
binding which compares with Mr. Pleger's in instructive- 
ness. In publishing these books THE INLAND PRINTER 
adds another to its long list of incomparable services to 
the printing and allied industries."

Send in Your Order Early for 

The Diplomacy of the War of 1914 

The Beginnings of the War 

By ELLERY C. STOWELL 

This, the first of three volumes that will cover the entire diplomatic history of the war, will take 
its place as a work of permanent value. For the first time, all documents relating to the outbreak of 
the war have been analyzed and rearranged in one chronological narrative, making a complete and 
understandable, day-by-day account of the momentous negotiations preceding the outbreak of hos- 
tilities. The book contains, furthermore, a remarkably lucid study of the relations of the European 
States, and of the problems involved in the outbreak of hostilities. In short it covers the entire ground 
in a fresh, accurate, impartial, and intensely interesting way, and by means of the unique arrangement 
and masterly analysis of the material it makes the whole tangled web of diplomacy clear and under- 
standable. $5.00 net.

The Cost of Living 

By WALTER E. CLARK 
(NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE SERIES) 

No more familiar expression is heard than "the high 
cost of living." The condition is one which affects 
everyone. Why are foods in many cases seventy-six 
per cent above their average price for the year 1896? 
The various reasons assigned for the conditions are 
examined in this book one by one and the real reason 
is made clear. Also the benefits of the higher cost 
are stated, nearly one-half of our population being 
prospered thereby. It is all intensely interesting 
reading, as authoritative as it is clear and compre- 
hensive. l6mo. Price, net $.50. 


Aircraft in the 
Great War 

By GRAHAME WHITE 
and HARRY HARPER 

The importance of aircraft in the 

present war is recognized by everyone, but few 
understand the duties they perform and the 
influence they exert on the results of a battle. 
This book gives in detail the activities of 
war aircraft in scouting, range-finding, bomb- 
dropping, etc. The airman is constantly looking 
for important movements of the enemy, and 
his alertness prevents the hurling of large 
masses of troops at a weak spot. 
As a range-finder in modern warfare the air- 
craft is indispensable, as they are able to direct 
the artillery fire at most effective points. 
A most interesting feature is the description 
of battles between the various types of aircraft. 

Illustrated. 8vo. Net $2.00. 


Trusts and Competition 

By JOHN F. CROWELL 
(NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE SERIES) 

The main aspects of the issues involved in "Big 
Business" are brought out in clear relief. The origin 
and growth of Trusts are described, and the legislation 
which has been carried on, and its results, is inter- 
estingly told. 
The facts and conditions accompanying the great 
combinations of industries are analyzed, and the 
author points out the way along which material pro- 
gress and popular contentment may live together.

THE NEW LITERATURE OF THE 
OCCULT. 

Unlike the moon, with its fixed hemispheres 
of light and shadow, the orb of humanity rolls 
restlessly from bright to dark. In the eight- 
eenth century there was a rationalizing day- 
light that peered into every crevice and cranny 
of the human mind. The nineteenth century 
tried to secure this clear certainty for all time 
by a system of science which pushed the 
Unknowable aside and set its own outposts on 
the farthest confines of space. But a change 
is now upon us. Whether we want it or not, 
the Occult and the Unknown are rising to 
dominate our thoughts. As to Hyperion on 
his glowing throne in Keats's poem, "omens 
obtruded, images obscure," so flocks of books 
about the supernatural and the psychic are 
wheeling into the world to-day. It is pretty 
sure that these books will influence man's life 
sooner or later; though indeed, superstition 
is so rooted in humanity that it needs little 
encouragement from doctrinal treatises. Crys- 
tal-gazing, fortune-telling, palm-reading, as- 
trological predictions, esoteric philosophies, 
all are flourishing. Nearly everybody one talks 
to has had some experience of these things, and 
admits some touch of faith in them. 

The most remarkable fact about the new 
literature of the Occult is that it has been 
pioneered or backed up by trained men of 
science, men whose names stand high in their 
own specialties. M. Camille Flammarion in 
France, Sir William Crookes and Sir Oliver 
Lodge in England, have spoken with no uncer- 
tain tones. A dozen or so years ago, M. Flam- 
marion essayed to place the whole subject on a 
scientific or experimental basis. He cast a 
huge drag-net and gathered in hundreds of 
cases of psychic experience, cases of halluci- 
nation, telepathy, transmission of thought, 
mental suggestion, communication from a dis- 
tance, astral bodies, which he presented in 
his book, " The Unknown." His more recent 
work, "Mysterious Psychic Forces," deals 
mainly with Eusapia Palladino. His English 
compeers have dealt with the subject in scat- 
tered reviews, pamphlets, and addresses. A 
few years ago, Sir William Crookes, in an 



406 



THE DIAL 



[May 27 



address to the English Authors Club, stated 
unequivocally that " there is no matter." 

With the work of these famous scientists 
may be joined the books of other trained and 
competent observers. Among the latter are 
Mr. Henry Holt, whose recent large work " On 
the Cosmic Relations" essays to envisage the 
whole subject and to give it a definite ter- 
minology ; Mr. Hereward Carrington, with his 
" Personal Experiences in Spiritualism " ; and 
Mr. I. W. Heysinger, with his " Spirit and 
Matter before the Bar of Science." A book 
entitled " Death," published two or three years 
ago, which dealt with all the circumstances of 
the parting of the body and soul and particu- 
larly took a most unpleasant view of our 
chances for premature burial, is one of the 
most gruesome works we ever remember read- 
ing. And there has been an immense recent 
crop of ghost stories and records of super- 
natural happenings, English, Scotch, and 
Irish. Andrew Lang alone slew his thousands 
of bogies. These tales show upon their faces 
that they are not the unassisted inventions of 
their writers. They are human documents, 
and therefore in some measure evidential. 
But anyone who is at all familiar with law- 
suits will have slight respect for the ability 
of the average human being either to know or 
to tell the truth about anything. 

Allied with these scientific or semi-scientific 
presentations of the psychic case, there have 
lately been published a good many books which 
view the subject in its historic aspects. Highly 
poetic in form, but substantially based on 
facts, is Mr. Oliver Madox Hueffer's "The 
Book of Witches." "Werewolves" by Mr. 
Elliot O'Donnel, " Vampires and Vampirism " 
by Mr. Dudley Wright, and " The Romance of 
Sorcery" by Mr. Sax Rohmer exhaust their 
several subjects. "New Presbyter is but old 
Priest writ large " said Milton, and it seems to 
us that the new scientific treatment of mys- 
terious psychic forces does not reveal any- 
thing which is not in the popular or poetic 
creations of the past. All the powers appar- 
ently possessed by mediums of whatever kind 
to-day have been in use by thaumaturgists and 
miracle-workers from the beginning. And as 
this old magic has a certain poetic glamour, we 
shall begin with the slightest and most per- 
functory sketch of it. 

As the fertile land in Egypt is only a fringe 
to the Nile, an effluence of its waters, so to the 
ancient dwellers in that country human life 



seemed to be only something temporarily afloat 
on the great stream of death. They had their 
eternal pyramids as tombs for their kings, and 
their Cities of the Dead as real homes for the 
people. The Egyptians, indeed, seem to have 
lived only in order to be buried. At the most, 
life to them was a butterfly which flutters for 
a few days, while the mummy was the grub of 
permanent duration. They embodied their 
deepest thought in the figure of the Sphinx, 
half human, half animal. They projected the 
idea of the Veil which no one has lifted. In 
India, aside from its religions, mythologies, 
and philosophies, always changing and always 
mysterious, there have existed from the begin- 
ning vast systems of magic, sorcery, and mira- 
cle-working. One, the largest of the Vedas, is 
made up of spells, incantations, rituals of 
darkness. The Hindus seem to have consid- 
ered it quite as necessary to propitiate the 
demons as the gods. The Soona plant, the 
plant of intoxication, was worshipped by them ; 
it had its god and most obligatory ritual. The 
Buddhist system of penance, renunciation, and 
fasting has helped the Hindus to a clearness 
of thought, or an hallucination of mind, which- 
ever way one chooses to regard it, which has 
made their magic memorable. The ancient Per- 
sians were wonder-workers and wonder-believ- 
ers. Babylon had its Magi, Belshazzar his Wise 
Men, and the rod of Aaron swallowed up the 
serpents of the Persian priests. The more 
modern Moslem inhabitants of that part of 
Asia have been soaked in superstition. The 
great wings of the Djinns, E frits, and Genie 
hover over and rustle through the Arabian 
Nights, which is a collection of popular tales. 
To every human being was born a familiar, 
to the female a Ginn, to the male a Ginnee; 
these grew up with the person, and if the lat- 
ter died young he was supposed to have been 
killed by his familiar. 

The clear and bright Greek mind tried for a 
time to banish the Occult and Unknown from 
the circle of humanity. Its work still remains 
the most sane and purely human the world has 
known. But there were plenty of shadowy 
places in Greek life and thought. Dodona 
with its Sibyls was the central heart of the 
race ; and though we do not know much about 
the Eleusinian Mysteries, they were probably 
concerned with the problems of the hereafter. 
The story of Medea and the novel of "The 
Golden Ass" show us that witchcraft flour- 
ished in its darkest forms in Greece. As for

the Romans, they started in life with a charm- 
ing outfit of domestic deities, Lares and Lem- 
ures, and as they grew in age they accepted 
anything in the way of superstition that was 
offered them from abroad. They were eclectic 
in their choice of tutelary guardians, and will- 
ing to give any supernatural power a chance. 
From the Greeks down to the present time 
there runs a line of laurelled and sceptred 
figures, men who were really daring experi- 
menters in science, but who were popularly 
accounted dealers in magic. Pythagoras, 
Empedocles, Apollonius of Tyana, Nostrada- 
mus, Roger Bacon, Dr. Dee, and Cagliostro 
were some of these worshipped and feared and 
doubted personages. The Middle Ages placed 
even Virgil among the magicians. Madame 
Blavatsky is perhaps the most striking recent 
example of the ability of a wonder-worker to 
command attention. Both M. Flammarion 
and Sir William Crookes were more or less 
impressed by her. 

The popular superstitions of the Middle 
Ages and of more recent times were limited in 
type but endless in manifestations. The idea 
of possession by the Evil Spirit or his agents 
underlies most of them. "Wierus made a cen- 
sus of the demons, and counted up 7,405,925 
of them. So they were not easy to escape. 
There is a story of a nun who forgot to say her 
"benedicite" before she sat down to supper, 
and who in consequence swallowed a demon 
concealed in the leaves of lettuce. Heine's 
idea, possibly following Milton, was that the 
demons and evil spirits generally were " Gods 
in Exile." Deposed or degraded with their 
religions, they wandered about the world tak- 
ing up what odd jobs they could get or turning 
their powers upon mankind in revenge. Wie- 
land the smith, for instance, was what was left 
of the magnificent Thor. Some of the uncanny 
creatures of the Borderworld, however, must 
have had a different origin. Vampires and 
Were-wolves must have been bad from the 
start. There is a recipe given in one of our 
books for getting rid of a vampire. With a 
picture of a saint in your hand you pursue it 
until you have it cornered in a large bottle. 
You cork this and throw it on the fire, and 
that is the end of the vampire. Lycanthropy, 
hereditary in some families, could be acquired 
by performing certain rites of Black Magic. 
The experimenter went to some spot remote 
from the haunts of man, desert or wood or 
mountain top, on a night when the moon was 



new and strong. On a level piece of ground 
he marked a circle of seven feet in radius. In 
this he kindled a fire, and placed an iron 
tripod and an iron pot over it. .He boiled 
water into which he east handfuls of three of 
these substances: asafcetida, parsley, opium, 
burdock, henbane, saffron, aloe, and solanum. 
Repeating a rhymed charm, he took off his 
vest and shirt and smeared his chest with the 
fat of a newly killed cat. He then bound 
around his loins a wolfskin and kneeling down 
waited for the advent of the unknown, which 
when the fire grew dim and cold and terror 
froze his blood appeared in some monstrous 
shape, half man and half animal. We are 
particular to give this formula because it ap- 
pears to have been the regulation thing, not 
only for becoming a Were- wolf but for sum- 
moning the Master of Evil in almost any 
predicament. In the last scene of Bulwer Lyt- 
ton's "Strange Story" it is repeated pretty 
faithfully. 

Mr. Hueffer considers the Witch the femme 
incomprise of the world. He follows her 
through all the irregular routine of her life. 
One thing is certain she strikes root more 
firmly in fact and history than most of the 
phantasms of superstition. There were women, 
hordes of them, reputed to be witches, perse- 
cuted as witches, burned as witches. Mother 
Shipton, Mother Redcap, the Witch of Wap- 
ping, Mother Demdyke, our old friend Eliza- 
beth Sawyer, immortalized by Ainsworth, the 
Witch of Edmonton, who furnished Ford and 
Dekker with a play, all these were historic 
characters. Nay, Jeanne d'Arc was burned 
as a witch. In Sweden there was a mania 
about witch children: multitudes of them, 
though watched in their sleep, reported that 
they had been transported to Blockula, the 
Northern Brocken. 

But let us bid adieu to those dear old days, 
and turn to the present material times when, 
as one of our authorities asserts, spiritual 
manifestations are ninety-eight per cent 
fraudulent. Others make out a better case 
for them ; but still there is a general opinion 
that all the modern mediums, the Davenport 
brothers, Mr. Home, Lily Dale, Eusapia Pal- 
ladino, and Mrs. Piper, whatever powers 
they may have possessed, were never averse to 
eking these out by trickery. The range of 
their manifestations is considerable; but, as 
we said before, there is nothing very new about 
them, except where modern appliances have 



THE DIAL

placed new instruments in their hands. Spirit 
photography, for instance, could not have been 
exploited in past times. On the other hand, 
the "Poltergeist," a thing which rings bells, 
breaks crockery, and throws objects about, is 
only Robin Goodfellow come again. 

But there is a vast range of psychic expe- 
rience which does not depend upon mediums, 
and about which there is gathering a mass of 
evidence scarcely to be ignored. About the 
factual truth of hypnotism, mental sugges- 
tion, and telepathy there can be no question 
whatever. Distant communication, levitation, 
astral appearances, ghosts, are more open to 
doubt ; but there are crowds of honest people 
who are willing to swear to their reality. Cole- 
ridge said that he had seen too many ghosts to 
believe in them. The present writer has had 
a few creepy experiences of this kind, but they 
are too slight and too uncertain to be worth 
relating. Some other psychic conditions he 
has known may perhaps be of interest. When 
a very young man, he put in nearly two years 
in the South American jungle as one of the 
managers of a great railroad expedition. He 
was pretty constantly fever-stricken and al- 
most as constantly starved. He was shot, had 
to contend with many mutinies, pursue hostile 
Indians into the forest, and struggle with 
native creditors. As a result, upon his return 
home, he was conscious of some queer states of 
mind. For one thing, the immediate past was 
blotted out, or could only be recalled by an 
effort; but in its place was substituted an 
expedition entirely different and even more 
striking, which filled his waking mind with 
the vividness of reality. Another thing was 
this : he had at that time published nothing ; 
but the feeling was so strong in him that he 
had not only written but published a large 
dramatic poem, that he would frequently go 
over to the bookcase to pick out the volume. 
Another strong impression was that he pos- 
sessed the power of levitation, that he needed 
only to touch his toes to the ground occasion- 
ally to propel himself long distances through 
the air. He certainly never attempted to put 
this gift into practice, but the sense that he 
possessed it was a snug satisfaction to him. 
Of course these were hallucinations; the 
writer was temporarily a trifle cracked. But 
that raises the question as to how far dementia 
and inspiration are apart. The Indians held 
that the manifestations of insanity were 
sacred ; and Swedenborg and the mystics gen- 



erally, to judge by their lucubrations, must 
have been somewhat of this opinion. 

What is the good of it all ? As someone in 
one of the volumes we have mentioned says, 
"What good is a baby?" That the super- 
natural cannot be proved may be granted. 
What can be proved ? Newton said that gravi- 
tation, the attraction between distant bodies, 
was impossible; and Faraday urged cogent 
arguments against his own conservation of 
energy theory. The nebular hypothesis and 
the atomic theories must probably go to the 
scrap-heap. If the shadowy impressions of 
the unknown and the unseen, the belief in 
immortality, the sense of immaterial presences, 
are part and parcel of the human mind, as all 
but universal experience would indicate that 
they are, then they are as much a part of life 
as anything else which seems to us to exist. 
Our crass everyday life of work and play, eat- 
ing and drinking, dressing and going about, 
is not permanently satisfying to anyone. Hu- 
manity has always revolted against it, and 
demanded something more "filling." It has 
built temples, raised banners, created arts, in 
order to gratify its need for a better and 
worthier existence. The supernatural is really 
the initiative of most of these efforts ; and the 
more, in a reasonable way, we work with the 
supernatural the greater and nobler our arts, 
religions, and thoughts become. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

THE SPEECH-ACQUIRING YEARS, with most 
persons, are limited to the earlier years of 
their lives, ability to make any appreciable 
additions to one's vocabulary diminishing rap- 
idly after adolescence. Hence the importance, 
as a rule, of putting language studies early in 
the educational course. Some light on the 
vexed question of the range of words used by 
normal children, and the growth of their 
vocabulary, is thrown by a minutely attentive 
study of his own boy, up to the age of two 
years, by Professor Thomas Percival Beyer, 
whose researches, first published in the " Edu- 
cational Review," now appear in separate 
pamphlet form. With admirable curbing of 
parental pride, the writer claims no precocity 
or other unusual attribute for his child; he 
simply calls him " an actual child of normal 
antecedents (no jail-birds or geniuses for four 
generations back) ," and yet at one year of age 
his vocabulary numbered about twenty sym- 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



409 



bols, including perhaps ten veritable English 
words, and five months later this stock had 
grown to " 160 words, most of them English," 
while at the end of the twenty-fourth month 
the number was 771. This list is printed. 
Noteworthy is the increasingly rapid enlarge- 
ment of the child's vocabulary, and the fact 
that, like other children, he now, in his third 
year, shows a decided acceleration of speed in 
acquiring new words, so that at his next birth- 
day he is likely to command a vocabulary of 
2200, and possibly 2500 words. Compare 
this readiness of word-acquisition with the 
average college student's sluggishness in the 
same particular. Commenting on the correla- 
tion between thought and language, the writer 
asks : " Therefore shall it not become a shame- 
ful thing and not to be tolerated for college 
men and women to continue to do business 
upon the verbal capital inherited from their 
unconscious childhood, plus a few hundred 
words absorbed during their imperfectly con- 
scious school-days? Shall the teacher of En- 
glish not demand some conscious effort to 
augment the needs of the organ of thought? 
Tooting on the pipes of infancy continues 
childish music through adult life. It will be 
only by adding new avenues of intake and 
outgo that adult life and thinking can grow 
into the richness and variety and color that 
should be the personality." A notable discov- 
ery was made by Professor Beyer in the fact 
that his boy showed an early command of a 
great variety of vowel and consonant sounds 
not present in our language, so that selection 
seemed to play an even more important part 
than imitation in his speech. This chimes with 
the results of recent research in child-psy- 
chology. Although one suspects baby Beyer 
to be a rather exceptional infant, he gives us 
nevertheless matter for useful generalization. 


THE FIRST LIBRARY BUILDING FOR CHILDREN, 

and for children only, is Brooklyn's note- 
worthy contribution to recent library develop- 
ment. Brownsville is the fortunate section of 
the city to be favored with this useful and 
already much-used addition to the general 
library system. For the three months follow- 
ing its opening the children's building was 
visited by an average of 1,566 juvenile book- 
borrowers daily; and, further than that, re- 
ports the librarian, " the quality of the reading 
and the admirable order of the children de- 
serve notice far more than do mere figures of 
use." It is significant that the youngsters, who 
are from the primary and grammar grades 
only, make such demands for non-juvenile lit- 
erature that an ample equipment of " adult " 
books has been found necessary, and has been 



provided. A few more items of importance are 
to be noted. " Up to seven o'clock, daily, this 
whole library is given over to the circulation 
of books. From seven to nine P. M. the place 
changes to a reading and reference library, 
and all the seats in the beautiful main rooms 
are filled with reference workers and earnest 
readers. . . . Another departure of this year 
has been the opening of a training course for 
children's librarians. The experience of years 
in being unable to secure from the library 
schools enough trained workers for this de- 
partment has practically forced us into giving 
our own course of training." Conspicuous in 
the scheme of things bibliothecal has been the 
recent rapid increase in consideration enjoyed 
by the juvenile user of the public library, 
especially in this country. May the American 
child, already fairly well imbued with a sense 
of his own importance, be able to preserve 
some remnant of bashfulness and modesty 
under this indulgent treatment! 


A NOTABLE ESSAY COMPETITION, already re- 
ferred to by us as instituted by the Carnegie 
Church Peace Union, and brought to a close 
with the opening of the current calendar year, 
has resulted, so far as the highest honors are 
concerned, in the award of the first prize (one 
thousand dollars) to Rev. Gaius Glenn Atkins, 
D.D., pastor of the Central Congregational 
Church, Providence, B. I. Competition for 
this prize was restricted to pastors of churches 
in the United States. Three lesser prizes, 
offered to students in theological seminaries, 
have been bestowed upon Mr. E. W. Nelson, 
of Phillips University, East Enid, Oklahoma; 
Mr. P. V. Blanchard, Andover Theological 
Seminary; and Mr. R. Niebuhr, Yale School 
of Religion, Lincoln, Illinois. The ten prizes 
offered to church members were all won by 
men, which may cause some surprise in view 
of woman's pronounced interest in the cause 
of peace. Some phase of this question, it will 
be remembered, was the topic on which all 
competing essayists were to write. Dr. At- 
kins's essay, entitled " The Causes of War," 
parts of which have been quoted by the news- 
paper press, points out some of the notable 
steps in the progress of the race that he al- 
leges to have been effected through the instru- 
mentality of war, and then seeks to explain 
why the world at large is to-day so doubtful 
of the efficacy of pacific measures to accom- 
plish like results. " Evidently," he says in 
explanation, "because we have failed to see 
that the solution of any question on the very 
highest levels is an immensely more difficult 
and heroic thing than its solution on lower 
levels. We fight because fighting is easier than

keeping the peace ; war is not, as its apologists 
would tell us, a high and heroic way out of 
international difficulties; it is the low and 
cowardly way. It is easier to take arms against 
a neighboring people than to sit around a 
council table and work out in wisdom and 
brotherhood and self-restraint, the questions 
which the war involves. However we may 
differ as to the wisdom of turning the other 
cheek, we must agree that it takes a braver 
man to turn the other cheek when he does it 
as a matter of principle than to strike back." 
A second tournament of pacific essayists un- 
der the same auspices, and to close with the 
end of the year, is now in progress. 


THE PUBLISHER'S RISK IN CHEAP REPRINTS 
ought not to be lost sight of in contemplating 
the considerable profits on the most widely 
circulated of these promoters of popular cul- 
ture. The lower the price, other things being 
equal, the larger the sales; but unless there 
is a clear profit, however small, on each copy 
sold, the larger the sales the heavier the losses. 
A certain salesman in a mammoth department 
store was once asked how it was that his house 
could afford to sell at a price alleged to be 
below cost a certain article advertised among 
its bargains. "Why, you see, we make our- 
selves whole by selling such an enormous num- 
ber," was the salesman's glib rejoinder. The 
shilling copyright novel that seems to have 
established itself in the English book-trade, 
can only be produced in its present grade of 
mechanical excellence on the assurance of 
large sales, so that untried talent can hardly 
hope for a chance to appeal to the great pub- 
lic in shilling volumes. The whole cost of 
production has been, of necessity, reduced to 
an astonishingly low figure, and a royalty of 
one penny on each copy sold has to be reck- 
oned in before the dealer's profit can be deter- 
mined. The latter is said to be as much as 
fivepence per copy, divided perhaps between 
the wholesale and the retail handler of the 
book, so that to one examining the matter the 
marvel is that so good an article can be manu- 
factured and sold without bankrupting some- 
body. No wonder there is risk in the operation, 
and an imperative necessity of large and brisk 
sales. ... 

IN MEMORY OF EPHRAIM WILLIAMS, the gal- 
lant soldier who served with distinction in 
King George's War, built Fort Massachusetts, 
near Williamstown, commanded a Massachu- 
setts regiment in the French and Indian War, 
lost his life in the battle of Lake George, 
Sept. 8, 1755, and (his chief claim to immor- 
tality) founded at Williamstown the free 



school which afterward became Williams Col- 
lege, in memory of this brave soldier, ardent 
patriot, and true gentleman, some utterances 
on the occasion of the two-hundredth anniver- 
sary of his birth have of late found their way 
into print and are deserving of note, especially 
as it has not often been given to an American 
college to celebrate the bicentennial of its 
founder. From Professor John H. Hewitt's 
commemorative address let us quote a sentence 
or two. " That Colonel Williams was a man 
of superior native gifts which he had culti- 
vated is evidenced not only by his letters, 
whose directness and terseness remind one of 
some of the letters of General Grant written 
on the field of battle, but also by the list of 
books mentioned in his will, which books show 
that he was a man not only of wide reading 
for that time, but of good literary taste. . . I 
have sought in vain to find in his letters any 
expression of malice or ill-feeling toward any 
to whom, or concerning whom, he was writing. 
That he was a gentleman, in the widest sense 
of the term and with all that the word implies, 
is evident from the following statements of 
President Fitch, whose words undoubtedly 
express a reliable tradition : ' His address 
was easy, and his manner pleasing and con- 
ciliating. Affable and facetious, he could 
make himself agreeable in all companies ; and 
was very generally esteemed, respected, and 
beloved. His kind and obliging deportment, 
his generosity and condescension, greatly en- 
deared him to his soldiers. By them he was 
uncommonly beloved while he lived, and 

lamented when he died.' "

A RENOVATED AND ENNOBLED FRENCH PRESS 

forms the subject of a well-written though 
somewhat florid article by M. Alfred Capus, 
member of the French Academy, in the 
" Revue Hebdomadaire." After reviewing the 
important part thus far played by French 
journalism in the present crisis, the writer 
says, toward the end : " Despite all the blem- 
ishes in its history, the press deserves now our 
full confidence: in these tragic days it has 
discovered the extent of its influence on opin- 
ion and the importance of its role during the 
war. All the phases of the conflict are re- 
flected in its columns, as are all the emotions, 
all the hopes, of the French soul. It has be- 
come more narrowly entwined in the life of 
the country than it ever was ; it has inter- 
preted the sentiments of France, it has faith- 
fully represented France in action ; and this 
collaboration France can never forget." 
Strengthened and ennobled, affirms M. Capus, 
will be the French press that emerges from 
this national struggle, and finally : " On look- 



1915]

ing back it will perceive the risks that it once 
incurred, and how, at certain moments, it 
came near to forfeiting its good name by in- 
dustrialism and violence: and how, then, it 
recovered its balance and acquired morality, 
culture, and poise. The war of 1914 will 
prove to have been its supreme test. Far 
from having foundered, it has taken on an 
incomparable air of dignity. It has bathed 
itself anew in its true well-spring, and it has 
seen of what it was capable when it was de- 
fending the cause of the Fatherland. Its role 
during the war will have been the glorious 
prelude to its role after the war, when the 
country will have to be reconstituted and 
France set back upon the true course of her 
history." . . . 

A NEW RUSSIAN GENIUS makes his advent in 
our western world through a series of transla- 
tions that have been appearing with increasing 
frequency during the last few years. " Poet 
Lore " seems to have been among the first to 
discover the noteworthy quality of Leonid 
Andreieff s dramatic compositions, for as long 
ago as 1907 it printed an English version of 
" To the Stars," and four years later it admit- 
ted to its pages " King Hunger." "Anathema " 
was published in 1910 by the Macmillan Co., 
" Sawa " and " The Life of Man " by Mr. 
Mitchell Kennerley in 1914, " Karal " and 
" The Sabine Women " achieved publicity the 
same year, as also " Love of One's Neighbor," 
and the Scribners have this year issued " The 
Black Maskers," " The Life of Man," and " The 
Sabine Women." Duplications in the forego- 
ing list indicate different translations, and 
mark also a notable measure of popularity. In 
due time this new writer may become even bet- 
ter known to our theatre-goers than to our 
book-readers. Realism seems to be the charac- 
teristic of his earlier plays, as also of the stories 
he wrote when first essaying authorship as a 
means of support ; but idealism, the stuff that 
dreams are made of, found a place in his 
art not long afterward. The tragic intensity 
of the Russian temperament is not wanting 
in this writer, whose hard life at one time 
brought him to the verge of suicide. The fact 
that he has by turns plied the brush of a 
portrait-painter and carried the green bag of a 
lawyer, besides acting at times as private tutor, 
proves the versatility of his talents and helps 
to quicken our interest in his many-sided per- 
sonality. . . . 

RETROSPECTS OF A QUARTERLY REVIEWER 
agreeably fill some pages of one of our current 
magazines. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge con- 
tributes to " The North American Review " a 
reminiscent sketch of his early connection 



with that periodical when it was wont to 
appear only four times a year instead of 
twelve. It was in 1872, he tells us, that he 
became, to his great pride and delight, its 
assistant editor, a position that he held until 
1876. After contemplating the vicissitudes 
this centenarian has passed through, he thus 
concludes his pleasant memories : " Yet ' The 
North American Review ' survives, more fre- 
quent in publication than at the outset, but 
more vigorous than ever. Best of all, after 
many wanderings and in these days of haste 
and hurry, the restoration of the qualities 
which gave it its old position has been found 
possible, and the criticism of literature and the 
purely literary articles have returned to its 
pages, where they were once thought to be 
fatal to popularity and to sales. To those who 
are interested in American literature and let- 
ters, this is encouraging in a direction where 
encouragement is much needed, and should be 
a matter for congratulation to all who care to 
see serious subjects seriously and ably treated, 
whose intellectual appetites are not wholly sat- 
isfied by pictures, and who would not have 
literature forgotten in a great periodical re- 
view. It is an especial satisfaction to one who, 
like myself, has a personal affection for our 
century-old 'Review,' and who cannot even 
repeat the name without calling up some 
happy memories from a past which now seems 
very distant in this fast-moving if not always 
improving world." 

MARK TWAIN'S CONTRIBUTION TO BELGIAN 
RELIEF would have been no stinted one had his 
life been extended into these soul-harrowing 
times. That with tongue and pen he would 
have made some pertinent and memorable 
utterances concerning Belgium's part in re- 
cent history, there can be no doubt ; nor would 
other and more substantial evidence of his 
attitude have been wanting. What he cannot 
now do in person his literary executor, Mr. 
Albert Bigelow Paine, has attempted in some 
small measure to do for him by contributing 
to the recent auction sale of authors' manu- 
scripts in aid of Belgium an unpublished 
piece of writing from Mr. Clemens's pen enti- 
tled " The New War Scare," written in 1898 
and covering twenty-nine pages in the author's 
handwriting. This sale, instituted at Dr. Ros- 
siter Johnson's suggestion, and carried out 
under the auspices of the Authors' Club in 
New York, took place on the twentieth of this 
month at the Anderson Galleries, whose pro- 
prietors gave their services, in printing and 
distributing the catalogue and conducting the 
sale, as their contribution to the cause, while 
our Minister at the Hague, himself a member

of the club referred to, took upon himself the 
. distribution of the accruing fund. Long and 
impressive is the list of authors, American and 
English, whose manuscripts or other contribu- 
tions, such as volumes of their works with 
autograph accompaniments, went to swell this 
rather remarkable sale. Welcome and consid- 
erable as will be the fund placed in Dr. Van 
Dyke's hands for the relief of suffering, the 
significance of the event, in its several aspects, 
is far greater. . . , 

THE CHILDREN'S NEED OF SHAKESPEARE as 
an educative influence in their formative and 
impressionable years was wisely emphasized 
by Miss Ellen Terry in a parting utterance as 
she embarked for England a short time ago. 
"As for the Germans," she is quoted as saying, 
"one must acknowledge that they honor 
Shakespeare in the best of all possible ways, 
by the frequent performance of his dramas. 
I wish England and America would do even 
more, by building a theatre in his honor. You 
know, in Germany you can hardly go into a 
city without finding a performance of one of 
Shakespeare's plays, while here and in En- 
gland, of late, ' it is a custom more honoured 
in the breach than the observance.' And don't 
you know, I feel that this neglect of Shake- 
speare is akin to a crime. For what about the 
children who are growing up now? Are they 
to know nothing of the work of the greatest 
master of the English stage? Must they go 
through their lives without the wonderful in- 
spiration that the beauty and poetry of Shake- 
speare gave those of us who are older and had 
the opportunity to see his plays in the forma- 
tive period of our lives ? It is the children I 
am pleading for when I plead for Shake- 
speare." But it is possible, in the dearth of 
Shakespeare performances on the stage, for 
children to catch something of his magic 
charm from the printed page, from Charles 
and Mary Lamb's " Tales " if not immediately 
and in tender years from the plays themselves. 
One is reminded here of the late Dr. Furness's 
expression of " measureless content " whenever 
he heard of young readers being kindled to 
new zeal for Shakespeare study by any word 
of his. ... 

AN ADDITION TO THE EPHEMERAL LITERATURE 

OF THE WAR is promised in the near future in 
the form of " a real American newspaper," to 
be published in New York by certain German- 
American organizations of that city, and striv- 
ing to be " absolutely impartial, doing full 
justice to the German cause." A warrant for 
the attainment of the latter half of this pur- 
pose, if not of the first, may be found in the 
announcement that Professor Miinsterberg 



will act as head of the publication's advisory 
board ; and another noted scholar and writer 
of German extraction, Dr. Hugo Schweitzer, 
an industrial scientist who has written with au- 
thority on Germany's economic and industrial 
condition, will hold the office of president of 
the publishing association which is to put the 
new journal into circulation. The number of 
periodicals which the war has called into being, 
most of them in Europe, of course, is now 
beyond counting, as is also the multitude of 
smaller newspapers and magazines that have 
been forced by the same agency to suspend 
publication. The mark of militarism, in its 
present manifestation, is impressing itself in 
various unmistakable ways on the world of 
print, no less than on the world of politics, 
economics, commerce, agriculture, manufac- 
turing, social intercourse, and in fact nearly 
every other form of human activity.

A NOTABLE GIFT TO WILLIAMS COLLEGE 

LIBRARY is reported. The giver is Mr. Alfred 
C. Chapin, a graduate of the college in the 
class of 1869, and already known for his gift of 
Grace Hall, the beautiful auditorium that 
adorns the campus. This welcome addition to 
the library is a collection of rare and valuable 
old books, chief among them being a perfect 
copy of John Eliot's Indian Bible, a copy con- 
cerning which the assertion is made that no 
other now known to be in existence is in so 
good a state of preservation. A second folio 
Shakespeare, likewise in excellent condition; 
" Poems " by William Cullen Bryant, Cam- 
bridge, 1821 ; first editions of Pope's " Essay 
on Criticism," Bacon's "Advancement of 
Learning," Jeremy Taylor's " Liberty of 
Prophecy," and Milton's " Liberty of Unli- 
censed Printing " these are a few of the 
more important items in the collection. The 
Bryant volume finds a singularly appropriate 
resting-place (it is too precious to circulate) 
within the precincts familiar to the poet in his 
student days, now more than a century ago. 
By a fortunate coincidence, though there may 
be a causative relation in it, the college trus- 
tees have just voted an extensive addition to 
the congested library building, one that will 
provide much additional shelf room for the 
growing book-collection. 



NEGLECTED CENTENARIES seem to be very 
much the order of the day in these troubled 
times. The excellent Anthony Trollope's birth 
occurred one hundred years ago last month 
(April 24), but the centennial recurrence of 
that date caused hardly greater commotion in 
the world at large than did his first appearance 
on this mortal scene. Another English nov-

elist of nearly equal fame was the object of 
similar neglect when his centenary occurred 
last summer some weeks, too, before the 
fatal first of August. Charles Reade is prob- 
ably better known for a comparatively small 
amount of good work than Trollope for an 
unusual number of novels of well-sustained 
excellence. But neither " The Cloister and the 
Hearth " nor the Barchester series has proved 
potent in arousing any considerable centennial 
enthusiasm over their respective authors. In 
a few weeks there will fall another and even 
more important centenary, of a very different 
character, but for obvious reasons no uniting 
of the nations in celebration of the event is to 
be expected, albeit a sort of unpremeditated 
reproduction of that historic occurrence on the 
Belgian plain to the south of Brussels, when 
the eighteenth day of June next comes around, 
is not beyond the bounds of possibility. 



COMMUNICATIONS. 

IN PEAISE OF THOMASES. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Woodrow Wilson's literary reputation, once a 
liability, is no longer held against him. If he can 
explicate the Mexican complication, reduce the cost 
of living through tariff legislation, not only bust 
some trusts but subject the great offenders to com- 
plete combustion, and secure the approval of the 
trend of events on the Repeal of Canal Tolls Ex- 
emption, Regional Banks, and his refusal to bestow 
his name on his grandson, the nation may even be 
willing to forget that he once taught in a Methodist 
college and later, miserabile dictu, in a Presbyterian 
university. But what right-minded Thomases every- 
where can never forgive is that he deliberately con- 
ceals the source of his literary inspiration; he 
repudiates his " Thomas." 

This is inexplicable from every point of view 
except one which hints darkly of early ambitions 
for power. Europe never had an important King 
Thomas. There seems to be a shy, sturdy, inde- 
pendent quality in the name which renders it unfit 
for either a truckling adventurer or a conquering 
leader. So our President was willing to accept the 
hereditary benefactions of his name, so potent in 
literature; but fearful of its political threat, he 
has not acknowledged it in public. 

It may or may not be regarded as worth noting 
that America has had just two literary presidents, 
and they were both christened " Thomas." True, 
Abraham Lincoln committed to posterity some 
speeches acknowledged the greatest pieces of ora- 
tory in the nineteenth century; but he was not 
primarily a man of letters. Certain other presi- 
dents have committed themselves to paper; but 
they were not and are not even secondarily men of 
letters. It cannot be seriously questioned that we 
have had just two literary presidents, Thomas 
Jefferson and Thomas Woodrow Wilson. (Why 
they should both be Democrats I do not at this 



moment know, though I have no doubt one could 
in a short time evolve a very good reason.) 

Didymus, one of the twelve, the first historical 
Thomas, and the only one whose Didymic claims 
have the slightest plausibility, has enjoyed the usual 
notoriety of the scientific pioneer. But for all that, 
his doubt has proved of more service to the spread 
of his Master's good news than has the faith of 
Peter. The Middle Ages paid him tribute by 
naming three of its greatest men for him : Thomas 
Aquinas, scholar, Thomas a Kempis, saint, and 
Thomas a Becket, soldier-statesman-priest-martyr. 
What triumvirate of Johns or Williams or Georges 
in the Middle Ages can compare with these three? 
Possibly to the extraordinary popularity of the 
last-named is due the immense harvest of English 
Thomases that has followed. Do but notice the list, 
with the particular work or quality of each : 

Thomas Occleve The Regement of Princes. 

Sir Thomas Malory Morte d'Arthur. 

Thomas More Utopia. 

Thomas Nash Plays. 



Thomas Campion 



Songs. 

Religio Medici. 



Sir Thomas Browne 

Thomas Hobbes Leviathan. 

Thomas Parnell Contentment. 

Thomas Percy Reliques. 

Thomas Gray Elegy. 

Thomas Chatterton Rowley Ballads and a fleet- 
ing glimpse of the most startling genius ever 
known. 

Tom Moore Songs. 

Tom Hood Poems and courage. 

Thomas De Quincey Suspiria de Profundis. 

Thomas Babington Macaulay Essays and that 

cursed boon, the balanced sentence. 

Thomas Carlyle Sartor Resartus, the greatest 
spiritual dynamic of his century. 

Thomas Henry Huxley Essays and honesty. 

Thomas Arnold Rugby. 

Thomas Hardy The finest novels in English. 

Add to this array of services the Summa 
Theologica of Aquinas, the Imitation of Christ of 
a Kempis, and the Shrine at Canterbury of 
a Becket, and I challenge any other name in the 
scroll to show a commensurable gift to the world. 

The poets are not so great; Didymus was not a 
poet. But what a heaven of prose-men ! The nine- 
teenth century, the age of doubt and reconstruction, 
is very properly the Milky Way for the Thomases. 
Carlyle and Hardy ! There are none to stand above 
them. America, be it said, shows a difference. 
Thomas Paine, the keenest of sceptics as well as 
the stanchest of patriots, and Thomas Jefferson, 
shrewdly suspected of religious heterodoxy, too 
strongly favored the original Didymus, and careful 
American mothers avoided the possibility of con- 
tagion. Thomas B. Read, Thomas B. Aldrich, 
Thomas W. Higginson, and Tom Daly braved the 
issue, but W T oodrow Wilson dodged too late. 

A scrutiny of the Blessed is incomplete without 
a glance at the Damned. (How should one know 
the Blessed else?) Was there ever a damned 
Thomas? Was there ever a great villain who bore 
the name? In this field we feel the lack of a mod- 
ern Dante. The fact that no Thomas has yet been 
inducted to the Ananias Club is rather good nega- 
tive evidence that is, no one except the Presi- 
dent, who has forfeited his right of sanctuary.

THE DIAL 



[ May 27 



A bird's-eye view of history reveals no king or pope 
who has made the name infamous, and fails to 
bring to light a single great rogue Thomas. True, 
a few millionaires stumbled on the name somehow, 
but even among these there is leaven. One turned 
traitor to his class a few years ago, and justified his 
literary heritage in yellow journalism de luxe. 

Some un-Thomassed person may unkindly say 
this praise would come more acceptably from him- 
self, that a Thomas should have more modesty, 
that he should be ashamed of such conceit, and so 
on. I am ashamed, but not of my conceit. The 
obscure author must be the reverse of " cocky," for 
his facts are a condemnation of himself; the more 
factual they are, the more condemnatory. This, 
then, is an exercise in humiliation. But there is a 
word to be said in simple justice and extenuation. 
Unlike the President of the United States, who fled 
his name, the writer sought it in anguish of heart, 
for in his youth he was called " Percy." Let no 
thoughtless person gibe or permit himself the care- 
less luxury of persiflage !

SOME THOUGHTS ON THE PEESENT 

GENEKATION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 
Even at the risk of being called a Words- 
worthian, it may surely not be amiss to protest 
against Mr. Hale's suggestion, in his article on 
" The Present Generation " in your issue of May 13, 
that Wordsworth's message to us of to-day is per- 
haps negligible. The representatives of the modern 
movement fuse liberty and law; with them dis- 
cipline becomes devotion, devotion discipline. But 
did not Wordsworth say all that, and more, a 
century ago? Where, in the writings of Kipling, 
Wells, or Bernard Shaw, do we find anything on 
the subject rising to the heights of the following 
stanza from the " Ode to Duty " ? 
" Stern Lawgiver! yet them dost wear 

The Godhead's most benignant grace; 

Nor know we anything so fair 

As is the smile upon thy face: 

Flowers laugh before thee on their beds, 

And fragrance in thy footing treads; 

Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong; 

And the most ancient heavens, through thee, are 
fresh and strong." 

The novelists and dramatists and poets of to-day 
are for the most part very, very solemn. They 
take both themselves and their readers far too 
seriously. Wordsworth made joy " its own secur- 
ity." Though all else he has written go by the 
board, if that one ode contains no message for our 
time the misfortune is ours. 

What a boon it must have been merely to be alive 
in those memorable days of the year 1880, which 
Mr. Hale pictures so vividly, when men thought 
only about the mugwump movement and civil ser- 
vice reform ! Our generation is so hopelessly bent 
on doing things and getting them done, and wreak- 
ing misfortunes and wrongs for the purpose of find- 
ing more things to do and getting them done. No 
greater calamity could befall our busy age than the 
discovery that the slums had been cleaned up, that 



wars were at an end, and that there were no longer 
any brothers, or nations, crying out for their souls' 
keepers. No one now thinks of reading Coleridge's 
" Christabel " through twice; for the joy of the 
incomplete, the dreamy, the meaningless, is not our 
joy. We make religion practical, ignoring the 
splendid opportunities once afforded men for 
speculating on the vague, the unknowable, and the 
unknown. It grows monotonous and melancholy, 
this feigning that all is well. At the best, we are 
nothing but primitives plus the veneer of civiliza- 
tion, and why blink the fact? In philosophy, too, 
we are pragmatists : whatever goes as a working 
principle, goes. Thales, standing on the shores of 
the Mediterranean and determining on water as the 
first principle of life, is one of the most poetical 
figures the world has ever known ; but old Thales is 
forgotten. His thinking was of no use: it was 
something we could doubt. That is philosophy. 

It was Sylvester of Johns Hopkins, brilliant logi- 
cian and mathematician, lover of poetry and music, 
who is said to have spent months over a difficult 
problem, willing to forgo both food and sleep while 
remonstrating friends pointed out the folly of his 
unpractical task. He persisted, despite protests. 
When the problem was solved, all that he is reported 
to have exclaimed is, " Thank God, it's of no use ! " 
And Sylvester, too, is dead. A. 0.

WAE POETEY IN GEEMANY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

From a recent issue of the " Protestant Weekly 
Letter," which has come to me from Berlin, I copy 
verbatim et punctuatim the following as of pos- 
sible interest to the readers of THE DIAL : 

" The general uplift brought about by the war and 
most evident in the sphere of religious thought, finds 
expression also in a remarkable fact, which may be 
told in two lines but speaks volumes, more than many 
a long story: from the declaration of war until into 
the late fall of 1914 about 1^ million new patriotic 
songs were written and printed. . . . The unnumerable 
unprinted poems are not included. 

" It is impossible for me to even make an attempt 
in judging this enormous production of poetry as to 
its literary value, no one is capable of doing this, nor 
will any one ever be. The mere fact of this immense 
quantity may act as a guide in forming an opinion on 
the mental attitude of Germany's millions during this 
world-embracing conflict. Side by side with the well- 
known names of our national poets of the present age 
stand those of thousands of unknown, whose poetic 
vein was awakened by the unusual events of this gen- 
eral conflagration. Old and young and extremely 
young, men and women, farmers and business-men, 
ulans, artillerists and pioneers, seamen and pilots of 
air-craft, deaconesses, physicians, students and pupils, 
army generals and University professors compete with 
politicians and men of administrative ability. Judg- 
ing this mass of literature from a purely artistic 
standpoint, there is no doubt that much of it is murky, 
although well-meant, and worthless trash; but as a 
manifestation of the country's soul, it is, taken as a 
whole, something stirringly great, like a huge phe- 
nomenon in nature. The most intensive mental and 
spiritual life of the nation can only find expression in 
the pathos of poetry." ARTHUB HOWARD NOLL.

MISS MITFORD AS A IjETTER-AY r RITER.* 

Elegant ease and abundant leisure amid a 
charming rural environment, with all condi- 
tions favorable for an occasional exercise of 
her graceful pen, for pleasure only, of course, 
and never for pecuniary profit this, or 
something like it, might be the casual reader's 
general impression concerning the earthly lot 
of her who nearly a century ago entertained 
an applauding public with her delightful 
sketches of "Our Village." How far from 
the truth any such impression would be, 
becomes at once apparent on reviewing the 
main events of Miss Mitford's toilsome life, 
and especially so in reading the recent very 
agreeable volume prepared by Miss Elizabeth 
Lee and entitled, "Mary Russell Mitford: 
Correspondence with Charles Boner and John 
Ruskin." Newness to print can be claimed 
only for the Ruskin letters, which include 
some to John James Ruskin in addition to 
those addressed to his more famous son ; the 
other letters named were made public in 1871, 
in the first volume of Rosa Mackenzie Kettle's 
" Memoirs and Letters of Charles Boner." 

After cheerfully sacrificing the best of her 
years and far too much of her strength to the 
support of a father who had squandered his 
wife's fortune and otherwise proved his un- 
worthiness of the unceasing affection and even 
adulation lavished upon him by that wife and 
that daughter, Miss Mitford was still, in the 
closing decade of her industrious life, in a 
condition to write the breezy and buoyant 
letters that are now, with biographical intro- 
duction and useful interspersed matter, pre- 
sented to the reader. For the greater part of 
these ten years (1845-55) she continued to 
occupy the tumble-down little cottage that had 
been the family home since 1820, " a series 
of closets," she calls it, " the largest of which 
may be about eight feet square/' But in 
1851, after pleading in vain with the landlord 
for necessary repairs, and when, as she writes, 
"if we had stayed much longer we should 
have been buried in the ruins," she removed 
from Three Mile Cross ( for that was the name 
of "Our Village") to the neighboring village 
of Swallowfield. It w r as a wrench, a " heart- 
tug," to leave the old home so rich in fond 
associations. " There I had toiled and striven, 
and tasted as deeply of bitter anxiety, of fear, 
and of hope, as often falls to the lot of 
woman," are her pathetic words. " There in

Boner and John Ruskin. Edited by Elizabeth Lee. With

the fulness of age, I had lost those whose love 
had made my home sweet and precious. . . . 
Friends, many and kind, had come to that 
bright garden, and that garden room. The 
list would fill more pages than I have to give. 
There Mr. Justice Talfourd had brought the 
delightful gaiety of his brilliant youth, and 
poor Haydon had talked more vivid pictures 
than he ever painted. The illustrious of the 
last century Mrs. Opie, Jane Porter, Mr. 
Gary had mingled there with poets still in 
their earliest dawn." 

Charles Boner made Miss Mitford's ac- 
quaintance in 1845, when he was thirty years 
old and she nearly fifty-eight. He is best 
remembered now, perhaps, as the introducer 
of Hans Andersen to English readers, his ver- 
sions of the ever-popular tales being made 
from the German, and one volume of these 
translations bearing a dedication to Miss Mit- 
ford, whose writings he had long admired. 
For six years in his early life Boner was 
tutor to the artist Constable's two oldest sons, 
and he wrote the explanatory and descriptive 
matter accompanying " Constable's English 
Landscape," besides helping the painter in 
other ways with his pen. Twenty years of his 
life he gave to the service of Prince Thurn 
and Taxis at Ratisbon, as tutor to his chil- 
dren ; and, first and last, he made himself an 
intrepid mountain-climber and skilful cham- 
ois-hunter, as might be inferred from his book, 
" Chamois Hunting in the Mountains of 
Bavaria," to which his correspondent at Swal- 
lowfield frequently refers. It was the poet 
Wordsworth who, on receiving a visit from 
Boner at Rydal Mount, suggested that the 
young man seek the acquaintance of Miss 
Mitford, which he was evidently very glad to 
do ; and that the pleasure was not all on one 
side is proved by the lady's words in a letter 
of later date: "Mr. Boner is a most accom- 
plished man. He came to me eight or nine 
years ago from Mr. Wordsworth, and we have 
been fast friends ever since." 

As to the Ruskin friendship, to which the 
less bulky but perhaps not less valuable por- 
tion of the letters now presented is due, it 
began long before the two correspondents met 
in 1847. That Miss Mitford was highly 
pleased with the man from the very first of 
her acquaintance with his person, in January 
of that year, need surprise no one familiar 
with the many published tributes to Ruskin's 
ingratiating manner and abiding charm. 
Charles Eliot Norton wrote of him long after 
Miss Mitford's time, " He still remains one of 
the most interesting men in the \vorld." She 
herself, soon after meeting him, wrote to a 
friend : " Mr. Ruskin was here last week, and

is certainly the most charming person that I 
have ever known. . . . He is just what if one 
had a son one should have dreamt of his turn- 
ing out, in mind, manner, conversation, every- 
thing." Eleven of her letters to the son and 
two to the father have escaped the ravages of 
time, and are included in the volume. Recur- 
rent in Miss Mitford's letters are the names of 
such celebrities of her time, and more often 
than not of her personal acquaintance, as the 
Brownings, Miss Martineau, Henry Chorley, 
Dean Milman, James T. Fields, George Tick- 
nor, Charles Kingsley, Bishop Wilberforce, 
Mr. and Mrs. Cobden, Joanna Baillie, Maria 
Edgeworth, Mrs. Somerville, Leigh Hunt, and 
many others; so that her correspondence 
constitutes a sort of early Victorian picture 
gallery of notables and their manners and 
customs. 

Miss Mitford is not new to the world as a 
letter- writer, since Chorley's edition of "Let- 
ters of Mary Russell Mitford," in two vol- 
umes, has been accessible to readers for more 
than forty years, and L'Estrange's biography 
of her, in three volumes, contains many of her 
letters, as does also his later work, " The 
Friendships of Mary Russell Mitford." Nev- 
ertheless it is well to have these characteristic 
utterances of her later years brought together 
in convenient and attractive form. They 
show her at her ripest and best as a letter- 
writer, and though they cannot be expected to 
raise her .to the rank of a Madame de Sevigne 
in this department of polite literature, they 
establish her position, if it be not already 
fixed, in the company of those friendly and, 
in no malicious sense, gossipy, and wholly 
pleasing and entertaining correspondents of 
whom Edward FitzGerald and his friend 
Fanny Kemble are among the best examples. 
Of Miss Mitford's manner in letter- writing 
she herself has something significant to say in 
one of her last communications to Boner, 
wherein she alludes to her fondness for epis- 
tolary unrestraint, but seems to credit herself 
with rather more of formality in her copious 
letters to her "friend abroad" than is actu- 
ally discoverable in them, though they are less 
impulsive than those to Ruskin. She says : 

" Mrs. Browning 1 , to whom at one time (that is 
to say, for many years) I used to write two or 
three times a week, always preferred those letters, 
written in a far more complete abandonment than 
anything I should do in the way of autobiography, 
to any of my writings. Professor Tom Taylor 
meant (from the same impression) to have inserted 
all I would have permitted of my letters in Hay- 
don's correspondence, and John Ruskin, to whom 
I also write with the same laisser aller, professes 
the same opinion. You, to whom I have chiefly 
written as a sort of English correspondent to a 



friend abroad, can hardly, perhaps, judge of these 
frequent and habitual epistles where the pen plays 
any pranks it chooses." 

More than once Miss Mitford makes it plain 
that she heartily dislikes " the trade of author- 
ship," however willingly she may receive the 
substantial returns that successful writing 
brings to her not over-plethoric purse. What 
she thoroughly enjoyed was gardening and 
social intercourse and hours of uninterrupted 
reading in the best authors, preferably 
French, of her own or a little earlier day. In 
the single month of January, 1806, she ap- 
pears to have run through fifty-five volumes, 
and her speed as a reader must have increased 
with the maturing of her powers. One of her 
earlier letters to Boner reveals her lack of 
enthusiasm for the production of books for 
others to read. This is the vein in which she 
writes, with considerable untruth as to the 
number of her literary friends and acquain- 
tances : 

" I have to thank you for your most kind letter, 
and for your verses, which are full of power; and 
now you must summon all your indulgence and all 
your faith in the sincerity of my esteem and my 
goodwill, and allow me to entreat you to find some 
better literary agent than my poor self. I live in 
the country, going rarely, if ever, to London, and 
then to one house only. I have as few literary 
friends and acquaintances as is well possible, and 
of the race of Editors and Journalists I know abso- 
lutely nothing. Then if I write to proprietors of 
magazines, or newspapers, or periodicals of any 
sort, requesting them to insert a friend's poem, the 
reply is sure to be that they overflow with poetry, 
but that they want a prose story from me, and 
most likely they trump up a story of some pre- 
vious application, and dun with as much authority 
as if I really owed them the article, and they had 
paid for it. Now all this is not only supremely 
disagreeable to me, but makes me a most ineffective 
and useless mediator for you. You should have a 
man upon the spot for those things, and not an 
old woman at a distance, hating the trade of 
authorship, and keeping as much aloof as possible 
from all its tracasseries" 

One extract from the Ruskin correspon- 
dence must now be given, and it will show 
the intimacy, the warmth of affection, and the 
height of admiration, with which she was 
wont to address him. 

" If I love you all father, mother, and son 
so much better than I seem to have a right to do, 
calculating only our personal intercourse, and that 
only with one, remember, dear friends, that it is 
your own fault. Recollect that for a dozen years 
or more there has been no benefit so large that you 
have not conferred it no attention so little as to 
be omitted by either. Then to say nothing of books 
fuller of high and noble thoughts than any that 
have appeared since the great age of English 
thinkers over which Milton and Jeremy Taylor

shed their light, and to which Cowley and Izaak 
Walton lent their sweetness, I have received from 
both father and son such letters as could only be 
written by men whose minds and whose lives were 
filled with kindness and purity and holiness. Yes ! 
I have all the right to love you that such knowledge 
and an ardent gratitude can give and you will 
pardon an intrusion that springs from such a 
source." 

More of the heart than of the head do we 
have in such letters as this to Ruskin ; but 
both the heart and the head are shown, in the 
letters as a whole, to be those of a noble and 
loving woman, a woman unusually endowed 
both mentally and morally, and one worthy of 
the wide circle of distinguished friends who 
delighted to respond to an invitation to the 
little cottage at Three Mile Cross. The col- 
lection of letters telling so pleasantly and 
informally the story of the writer's closing 
years, and appropriately illustrated with por- 
traits and views, is a notable contribution to- 
early Victorian literary history.

THE EPIC or FREXCH EXPLORATION 
ix AMERICA.* 



It is seldom that there appears a book on 
just the plan and with the distinctive char- 
acter of Mr. John Finley's " The French in 
the Heart of America." In this country we 
are not now given to the production of histori- 
cal w r orks pitched in a key of high eloquence, 
and persistently maintained at that pitch. 
The Parkmans and the Bancrofts yield place 
to the McMasters and the Schoulers; oratori- 
cal passion surrenders to impassive literal 
exactitude. But in the case of the present 
work, we have a distinct reversion to the 
older type: Mr. Finley confessedly takes for 
his model the "Homeric Parkman." The 
" Epilogue " to this book is actually an essay 
on "Francis Parkman: The Historian of 
France in the New World." 

The first quality of Mr. Finley's work, then, 
is the quality of spoken eloquence, the subtle 
factitiousness which somehow seems to inhere 
in the production designed primarily to be 
heard, rather than read. It must, however, be 
pointed out that the eloquence here is not the 
eloquence of Parkman; it is really the elo- 
quence of Finley. And we may well believe that 
these speeches, here appearing as chapter divi- 
sions, were heard by attentive and fascinated 
ears " in the Amphitheatre Richelieu of the 
Sorbonne, in Paris, and in Lille, Nancy, Lyons, 
Grenoble, Montpellier, Toulouse, Bordeaux,

Poictiers, Rennes, and Caen." Despite the 
strain which comes from listening to one who 
habitually speaks in oratorical tones, one feels 
that the first half of this book is best treated 
that way ; the last half suffers disproportion- 
ately. It is not history that the author writes : 
he has little sense for real continuity and 
minor detail, the massing of which is so often 
indispensable for the creation of true historical 
perspective. He paints with a brush of massive 
dimensions; the canvas he covers with heroic 
figures, having length but little breadth or 
depth. Two qualities, deserving of singular 
commendation, in this impressionistic personal 
journal, are these: the author's individual 
passion for sensing origins through personal 
examination at the source ; and his constitu- 
tional devotion to the world of out-of-doors 
and the sport of exercise, which has carried 
him, on foot, over the grand routes of the 
French explorers, the sinuous courses of the 
forgotten portages, the hidden trails of the 
extinct coureurs de bois. 

After giving us, with bright tint and broad 
stroke, the historical background of the labors 
of those gallant and persevering Frenchmen, 
and a suggestion of the permanent survivors 
of that once dominant civilization, the au- 
thor has attempted the difficult task of show- 
ing the birth, grow r th, and development of 
present-day America out of that past, and 
moulded by it. The subject, we realize, is 
epic; and, true poet in instinct, the author 
has given it nothing less than the epic treat- 
ment, We feel it to be epic, vast as the 
vivid pictures pass us in brilliant array: 
Jacques Cartier in the dim middle vast of the 
continent; Champlain, at Quebec, heroically 
struggling for the permanence of his foothold ; 
the pious Maisonneuve at Montreal ; the Chris- 
tian spirits of Le Caron, Brebeuf , and Gamier, 
suffering peril, hardship, torture, and death, 
that the heathen may know God ; the winning 
of Marquette to the " Great Water " ; and the 
ultimate triumph of La Salle. The tone of the 
book may be caught in the following character- 
istic passage : 

"And, seeing and hearing all this again, we have 
seen a land as large as all Europe emerge from the 
unknown at the evocation of pioneers of France, 
who stood all, or nearly all, sooner or later within 
three or four kilometres of the very place in which 
I sit writing these words. Cartier gave to the 
world the St. Lawrence River as far as the Falls of 
Lachine; Champlain, his Recollect friars and 
Jesuit priests and heralds of the woods, added the 
upper lakes; and Marquette, Joliet, La Salle, 
Tonty, Hennepin, Radisson, Groseilliers, Iberville, 
Bienville, Le Soeur, La Harpe, the Verendrye 
father and sons and scores of other Frenchmen, 
many of forgotten names, added the valley of the

river of a hundred thousand streams, from where at 
the east the French creek begins a few miles from 
Lake Erie to flow toward the Ohio, even to the 
sources of the Missouri in the snows of the Rock- 
ies ' the most magnificent dwelling-place,' again 
to recall De Tocqueville, ' prepared by God for 
man's abode; the valley destined to give the world 
a field for a new experiment in democracy and to 
become the heart of America.' " 

The indifference to exactitude which the 
book seems to betray is particularly marked in 
the case of Mr. Finley's allusions to the ex- 
plorer whose name he bears. As if it were 
unimpeachable, he quotes the following pas- 
sage from " The Western World " : 

" That delightful country [Kentucky] from time 
immemorial had been the resort of wild beasts and 
of men only less savage, when in the year 1767 it 
was visited by John Finley and a few wandering 
white men from the British colony of North Caro- 
lina, allured by the love of hunting and the desire 
of barter with the Indians. The distance of this 
country from populous parts of the colonies, almost 
continuous wars, and the claims of the French had 
prevented all attempts at exploration." 

The author says that " he seized upon this " ; 
but care for accuracy might w r ell have re- 
strained him from being so precipitate. John 
Finley, the explorer, visited Kentucky as early 
as 1752, despite the figure given by the untrust- 
worthy and fanciful Filson. On this visit he 
was assuredly not accompanied by "wander- 
ing white men from the British colony of North 
Carolina." There is documentary evidence to 
show that John Finley sailed down the Ohio, 
and later, no doubt, the Mississippi; but we 
have no means of knowing where he stopped. 
It is highly probable that he stopped in the 
land visited fifteen years before, especially 
in view of the fact that only two years later he 
was piloting his comrade-in-arms of the Brad- 
dock campaign, Daniel Boone, from the valley 
of the Yadkin (Holman's Ford) through Cum- 
berland Gap to the heart of Kentucky. It was 
on this trip, in 1769, that Finley was accom- 
panied by " a few wandering white men from 
the British colony of North Carolina." These 
white men, five of them, with Finley as guide 
making the sixth, were not mere purposeless 
wanderers into a trackless wilderness. They 
w r ere sent on their journey of exploration by 
Colonel Richard Henderson, colonial judge, in 
behalf of the famous land company afterwards 
entitled the Transylvania Company. 

The absence of illustrations is a source of 
great regret. The interest of the original 
articles in " Scribner's Magazine" was won- 
derfully enhanced by an admirably chosen 
collection of pictures. A limited edition, with 
illustrations, should certainly be published.

WILLIAM II. OF GERMANY.* 



Ernest Renan a short time before his death 
expressed regret that he should not live to see 
the unfolding of the multiform personality of 
William II., then the " young Kaiser." In the 
last quarter of a century we have been privi- 
leged to behold what Renan has missed. Con- 
sidered as a spectacle of life it has been worth 
while. Emperor William has been the most 
influential, the most discussed, and in some 
ways the most interesting character in the 
world. This interest is of course due in great 
part to his position, but it is also to a consid- 
erable extent inherent in his personality. 
Until the record is closed any judgment passed 
upon him must necessarily be provisional. As 
matters stand no\v, consistency is the last 
quality that can be attributed to him. There 
are contradictions in his character and career 
that cannot be resolved, high seriousness of 
purpose coupled w r ith vanity and almost child- 
ish love of show, atavistic assertion of divine 
rights joined to a twentieth century modernity, 
the attitudes of a war-lord glorying in the 
"mailed fist" and "shining armor" (his own 
phrases) along with the pose of the sovereign 
"who kept the peace of Europe." The one 
thing which may be asserted of him without 
qualification is that he has always developed 
his restless activity in the public gaze. Unlike 
his royal cousin, George of England, he is a 
monarch in love with his job. His speeches, 
of which he has delivered upwards of a thou- 
sand, for the most part on military occasions, 
are in themselves evidence enough of his 
superabundant vitality and his determination 
to assert his own views, while the clear, terse, 
and at times eloquent style of these utter- 
ances testifies to an awakened intelligence and 
a sense of form, whatever one's verdict on the 
substance may be. 

Any attempt to read the riddle of the 
Kaiser's character without some historical 
guide is bound to be hopeless. As evidence we 
may take the little volume, " My Ideas and 
Ideals," in which several hundred utterances 
of the Kaiser are juxtaposed roughly accord- 
ing to subject, but without context or explana- 
tion and apparently also without chronological 
order. The result is simply bewildering, and 
leads nowhere. Professor Christian Gauss of

Princeton, on the other hand, has performed 
a useful service by arranging some of the most 
striking speeches under various headings, and 
by giving the setting and the necessary his- 
torical background in each case. It is possible 
by means of his book to follow certain lines of 
the imperial policy with fairly satisfactory 
clearness. The compiler's attitude, it should 
be added, seems to be thoroughly neutral. 

The handsome book entitled " The Kaiser " 
by Mr. Asa Don Dickinson contains numerous 
illustrations, and the text, though of a sketchy 
nature, is interspersed with much shrewd 
comment. A few slight mistakes should be 
corrected in another edition : the date of the 
founding of German South West Africa is 
wrongly given (p. 68) , the " Daily Telegraph " 
interview appears as the " Daily Mail " inter- 
view (p. 52), and the "November storm" is 
stated as occurring in 1909 instead of 1908 
(p. 161). 

The personal character of the Emperor as 
it is revealed in his domestic life is sympa- 
thetically described in " Memories of the 
Kaiser's Court " by Miss Anne Topham, who 
was for some years English governess to 
the Princess Victoria Louise. Though her 
sprightly, gossipy book is mainly devoted to 
the general life of the court, it gives many 
entertaining glimpses of the Emperor as he 
appears in his intimate circle, frank, gen- 
erous, open-hearted, and with a love of raillery 
if not a genuine sense of humor. It is also an 
ultra-masculine figure, after the German fash- 
ion, that is shown here. The following obser- 
vation of the author deserves to be quoted 
because it discloses something characteristic: 
" He can explain everything to everybody ; but 
there is one exception the suffragettes. He has 
never been able to explain them. They baffle him 
entirely. At first he thought they were just disap- 
pointed spinsters, but in view of the number of 
married women in their ranks he was obliged to 
abandon this idea. Since then he has been groping 
in vain after a satisfactory solution. . . It is of 
no use to explain to His Majesty the difference 
between militant and non-militant suffragists. . . 
' Women should stay at home and look after their 
children,' is his last word on the subject." 

But indeed, as Miss Topham remarks, the 
Emperor has for English politics as apart 
from English life, which he loves a per- 
plexed and irritated wonderment and con- 
tempt. 

The ablest discussion of the Emperor's poli- 
cies and the results they have achieved is to be 
found in the volume by Dr. Stanley Shaw of 
Trinity College, Dublin. This short book was 
written before the war, and can certainly not 
be accused of an unfavorable bias. Unfor- 
tunately a new chapter "by another hand," 



which has been added since the outbreak of 
hostilities, is much inferior in both ability and 
temper. Dr. Shaw has built his book mainly 
out of the recorded deeds and utterances of 
William II., but he has buttressed it liberally 
from the memoirs of Bismarck, Hohenlohe, 
and Billow. Doubtless the historian of the 
future will have to use much further mate- 
rial ; for the present these sources must suffice. 
In order to explain the persistent enigma of 
the Emperor's personality and career, must 
we have recourse to the rather desperate 
hypothesis of paranoia, or of some kindred 
mental derangement? Some alienists have 
pointed out as evidence his over-weening self- 
esteem, his belief in his divine mission, his 
impulsiveness and incalculability, noting at 
the same time that certain physical stigmata 
are not lacking. That is also the burden of 
a recent poem by Verhaeren, who sees in 
the devastation of Belgium the work of a 
madman. Let us attempt a simpler and more 
natural explanation. Much will be made 
clear if we assume that the Kaiser is com- 
pounded of two natures, one modern and 
materialistic, the other mediaeval and idealis- 
tic. William II. is modern only as far as the 
external world and the things of the senses 
are concerned. As a child of his time he has 
appreciated from the outset the fact that he is 
cast in an age of commerce and industry, of 
rapid transit and invention. He has gloried 
in the marvellous expansion of Germany's 
trade, in her triumphant industrial progress, 
in the formidable growth of army and navy. 
This is the William who has practised Macht- 
politik, cultivated the Krupps, and extolled 
Count Zeppelin as the greatest German of the 
twentieth century. But in the things of the 
intellect and the spirit, in ideas and ideals, he 
is faithful to his inheritance, and remains a 
romanticist and even a medievalist. This is 
pre-eminently true of his religion, the sincerity 
of which seems beyond cavil. He looks upon 
himself almost as a high priest; the name of 
God is constantly upon his lips, recently, 
because of the incongruous circumstances, to a 
positively offensive degree. But his God is 
"our great Ally," a German tribal deity, a 
sort of magnified and non-natural Hohenzol- 
lern. Of that modern Christianity which finds 
its highest expression in the Sermon on the 
Mount he has little appreciation, even though 
in a memorable speech he has referred to 
Jesus as "the most personal of all personali- 
ties." As in religion, so too in politics he has 
missed the spirit of the age, and his total 
failure even to comprehend the meaning of 
democracy will, unless the wheel of time is 
somehow miraculously reversed, indubitably 



420

wreck his ultimate reputation as a statesman. 
The claim to divine right, which was for a 
time regarded as an exuberant touch of youth- 
ful rhetoric, was unequivocally repeated at 
Konigsberg in 1910, and, according to current 
reports, was even more glaringly asserted at 
the outbreak of the present war. All this is 
not to say that he has been without solicitude 
for the common people. But he has never ad- 
vanced a particle beyond the paternalistic 
conception of a government from the top 
down, handing out favors with disciplinary 
care to a docile and unambitious proletariat. 
"Leave the Socialists to me," he said to Bis- 
marck very early in his reign, and attempted 
to win them by kindly admonitions. When 
they refused to respond to blandishments, he 
became exasperated and denounced them as 
traitors and enemies of religion. The result of 
this mingling of conciliation and abuse has 
been the growth of the Social-Democratic vote 
to the portentous total of four and a quarter 
millions. A similar lack of understanding has 
marked the imperial treatment of Alsatians 
and Poles in their struggle for autonomy. 
That aspiration for liberty which is so irre- 
pressible in the modern breast finds but scant 
recognition in the constitution of Germany, 
and none at all from "William II. 

In like manner he has failed to appreciate 
the modern spirit in literature and the arts. 
Writers like Ganghofer and the egregious 
Lauff have been taken to his bosom, while 
Hauptmann has been neglected or snubbed. 
The mortuary Siegesallee in Berlin represents 
what his patronage of sculpture has evoked. 

Since the Kaiser dropped the old pilot in 
1890, he has virtually been his own chancellor. 
The government has followed the lines of 
policy laid down by him. At most a more 
forceful chancellor like Billow ventured once 
or twice to check his imperial master, but gen- 
erally his ministers have been as acquiescent as 
the dull and pedantic Bethmann-Hollweg. It 
may be profitable to inquire for a moment 
whither the "new course" has led Germany. 
Bismarck's policy had been purely continental, 
and had aimed at making Germany secure and 
dominant in Europe. The policy of Germany 
under the Kaiser's personal rule has been, 
briefly, to establish a new world-power. 
Viewed from almost any angle, the result is 
not brilliant. It is an unescapable fact that 
whereas in 1890 Germany had only one enemy 
in Europe France, in July of 1914 she could 
count upon only one sure friend Austria. 
Beyond a doubt, indiscretions like the Kruger 
telegram and hob-nailed diplomacy such as 
precipitated the two Morocco crises account- 
for much of this estrangement. But the out- 



come was really almost inevitable. It is Ger- 
many's tragedy to have entered late into the 
race for empire and to have found the earth 
pre-empted. The alternative to reaching out 
and running foul of her neighbors would have 
been to cultivate contentment at home. Which 
was the part of wisdom ? In view of the pres- 
ent cataclysm, from which Germany can at 
best only emerge with even honors, the answer 
is scarcely doubtful. 

There remains the most interesting question 
of all. The Kaiser won the admiration of the 
pacifists because of the indisputable fact that 
for twenty-six years he kept the peace of 
Europe, often against strong pressure from 
within, and frequently proclaimed that to be 
his unswerving aim. But, up to the summer 
of 1914, did the net influence of William II. 
make for peace or war? It is here, as Mr. 
Dickinson points out, that the small cool voice 
of common-sense reasserts itself. During those 
years the Kaiser was sponsor for the navy, he 
was supreme representative of the army, in 
whose uniforms he almost invariably appeared 
and whose dominance within Germany he con- 
stantly maintained; he was the author of the 
most famous winged words of militarism, and 
the living embodiment of the doctrine si vis 
pacem, para bellum, the sophistry of which 
now seems manifest to everybody. Such is the 
Hohenzollern tradition; the fighting spirit 
was in his blood, even though for prudential 
reasons he long refrained from war. When 
we come to the present crisis, matters appear 
even worse. The issue of Europe's peace or 
war lay in his hands last July, and deliber- 
ately or reluctantly he chose war. A hint 
from him would have restrained his Austrian 
ally, a nod would have brought about the con- 
ference which Sir Edward Grey suggested, 
and he could have had it virtually on his own 
conditions of time and place, and hence with- 
out loss of dignity. Taking advantage of a 
favorable international conjuncture, he in- 
sisted upon pushing through his Balkan pro- 
gramme at all hazards; and so precipitately 
did his government press matters, so heedless 
was it of ordinary diplomatic manceuvering, 
that it cannot now even make a decent pre- 
tence of having tried to avoid war. It may be, 
as Mr. Andrew Carnegie, Dr. David Starr Jor- 
dan, and other pacifists have surmised, that 
when the Kaiser returned from Norway last 
July matters had already got almost beyond 
control and that in the end his hand was vir- 
tually forced by the military clique. Or it 
may be that he himself had gradually been 
won over to the view that war was inevitable 
and now realized that the opportune moment 
for Germany had finally come. This is the

view elaborated in the French Yellow Papers, 
and recently reaffirmed by Lord Haldane. 
Proof is lacking at present, but some color of 
plausibility is lent by such considerations as 
the popular resentment in Germany against 
the government for its humiliating backdown 
in 1911, the taunts of the nationalistic press, 
the stings of that gadfly among German jour- 
nalists, Maximilian Harden, and most of all 
the ever-present pressure from the chiefs of 
the General Staff by whom the Kaiser is con- 
stantly surrounded. But in either case the 
difference of responsibility is only one of 
degree. William II. will go down in history 
as the aggressor in the greatest war the world 
has ever seen. Yet, barring a supreme disas- 
ter, it is hardly likely that he will have many 
pangs of remorse. A chronic optimist by 
temperament, panoplied in his sense of divine 
guidance, he has always been proof against 
self-reproach. Scapegoats will be found, 
there are signs already that certain men are 
predestined victims. Chastened in mood the 
Emperor may be, and probably the soul- 
solitude brought by advancing years will in- 
crease upon him greatly; but, unless he 
forgoes his nature utterly, he will to the end 
manifest his tireless activity, ever ready, in 
the words of one of his favorite poems, 

" to fill the unforgiving minute 
With sixty seconds' work of distance run."

THE COSMIC SOUL.* 

Mr. Holt's book on the Cosmic Relations is 
an attempt to justify the ways of " spirits " to 
men. The author is, however, under no illu- 
sion as to the weight of his evidence, or as to 
the probability-coefficient attaching to his 
hypothesis of a Cosmic Soul. " I cannot envy 
the man," he insists, " who can write on these 
vague subjects without painfully mistrusting 
himself." Mr. Holt's method of presentation 
has left him, he assures us, "absolutely un- 
trammeled by any theory, except what has 
grown up during the work itself." Hence he 
claims for his results no finality. "Many of 
the facts presented are very nebulous, and the 
guesses are naturally more nebulous still." 
His hypothesis " admits no affiliation with the 
famous masses of guesswork which announce 
themselves as established truth." Conse- 
quently, " I don't propose to go to the stake for 
it, or send anybody else for denying it." 

What, then, are the facts which necessitate 
so apologetically expounded an hypothesis, and 

* ON THE COSMIC RELATIONS. By Henry Holt. In two vol- 
umes. Boston : Hourhton Mifflin Co. 



what is that hypothesis ? The facts are a mass 
of reports on " psychic phenomena " : telepa- 
thy, dreams, levitation, controls, spirits, me- 
diums and the inevitable and indefatigable 
Mrs. Piper. Under the challenging captions 
of " telekinesis," " autokinesis," " psychokine- 
sis," and " telepsychosis," Mr. Holt presents an 
array of data discouraging in its minuteness. 
If the 750 pages of " evidence " are meant to 
convince, compression as well as suppression 
would have served our author's purpose much 
more efficaciously. 

Mr. Holt, to be sure, is convinced con- 
vinced of Immortality and of a Cosmic Soul. 
He invites us to examine " a vast mass of pro- 
foundly interesting phenomena . . which can- 
not be accounted for by any form of telepathy 
or any cause justified by experience. On the 
surface, the phenomena are ostensibly caused 
by human intelligences surviving death. Re- 
ject that cause," we are disconsolately warned, 
" and (pace Drs. Tanner and Hall) there is no 
other in sight." The " whole thing," further- 
more, " readily comes under the hypothesis of 
the Cosmic Soul of ideas and impressions of 
all sorts floating about the universe picked 
up in all sorts of ways and in all sorts of com- 
binations, and remodeled into all sorts of new 
combinations." We must, accordingly, posit 
"back of all phenomena the Cosmic Soul, 
which is sometimes called God, which gener- 
ates and includes and manifests and inter- 
communicates all personalities that are, or 
have been, or are to be, and which, with them, 
dies not." Thus Mr. Holt, scientist of the 
Metapsychical. 

When we turn, however, from Mr. Holt's 
science to his comments and annotations which 
punctuate the multifold array of " facts," to 
his gentle humor and still gentler skepticism, 
to his light humanistic by-the-ways on general 
ethics, sex-morality, and happiness, inter- 
spersed with delightful gibes at current con- 
vention, not excluding his chatty and personal 
hints for a latter-day " mediumistically " dem- 
onstrated Theodicy, we are inclined to the 
belief that we shall discover the major value 
of the book not in its elucidation of one more 
hypothetical Universal All-including Soul, not 
in its pathetic albeit manfully sustained desire 
to establish the Newer Immortality, but rather 
in its human, supremely human, quality of 
"Apologia pro Optimismo Meo." 

Optimism romantic, mystic, rhapsodic 
alternates irrepressibly with pagefuls of argu- 
mentation. " I cannot remember," writes Mr. 
Holt, " when I did not have the rudiments [of 
the Cosmic Consciousness] before great scenery 
and great music, and it culminated in me ten 
years before the usual period. . . It came with 



t

the blaze of light, but the light was from the 
natural sunset." And to Mr. Holt, poet of the 
Cosmic Relations, " the powers of mystery are 
lovely as well as awful. The mists and moun- 
tains and dark shadows opposite me as I 
write, are both. I do not read their meaning, 
as I read the meaning of a 2 -f- 2ab -(- b 2 , but 
they lift and expand and deepen the soul as do 
no meanings that I can read ; and while they 
raise the most terrible questions, they answer 
them with : ' Peace ! Wait ! Work ! Earn the 
rest that you feel is in Us ! All will be well ! ' ' 

" Perchance," concedes the less romantic 
reader, " all will be well. Yes, 'tis very pretty 
rhapsody, but is it science ? " And this same 
matter-of-fact reader, deeply appreciative as 
he is of the utter lack of dogmatism on the 
part of the author in the exposition of his ten- 
tative hypothesis, fully recognizing the spirit 
not only of caution but even of skepticism 
pervading the work, is still haunted by a sus- 
picion, even a conviction, that not all is well 
if not demonstrably with the Universe, at 
least with the scientific procedure of Mr. Holt. 
"On seeing the MS. (or rather TS.) of this 
chapter," Mr. Holt confidingly relates, "my 
friend . . asks whether . . I do not, in treat- 
ing them [certain controls] in a spirit of lev- 
ity, show less confidence in the . . controls 
than I really feel. I wish somebody would tell 
me how much I really feel. And if he tells me 
on Sunday, I wish he would tell me again at 
the end of the week. Sometimes I feel a good 
deal, and sometimes I don't." This sounds 
perilously near to Spinoza's apocryphal little 
speech to his God: " Entre nous, je crois que 
vous n'existez pas." 

Of the precariousness of his position, Mr. 
Holt is all too well aware ; his insistence on the 
plausibility of his solution of the problems of 
spiritism and immortality is politeness itself. 
Lest, however, his scientific humility should 
seem to overreach itself, he is ever ready with 
a corrective an attenuated mysticism; nor 
is a tinge of satire wanting. "We, in our 
immeasurable wisdom, don't see how it [immor- 
tality] can work we don't see how a universe 
that we don't begin to know, which already has 
genius and beauty and love, and which seems 
to like to give us all it can birds, flowers, 
sunsets, stars, Vermont, the Himalayas, and 
Grand Canyon ; which, most of all, has given 
us the insatiable soul, can manage to give us 
immortality. Well ! Perhaps we ought not to 
be grasping ought to call all we know and 
have, enough, and be thankful." 

A scientist, however, who is so magnani- 
mously hesitant about his science will surely 
not fail, when hard pressed, to be equally non- 
belligerent about his romantic Universe and 



Cosmic Soul. For, is it not written by Mr. 
Holt himself : " If in solitude . . anywhere 
under the stars, you have not already felt that 
conception, you will probably find my efforts 
wasted"? HENRY M. SHEFFER. 



THE NEW SPIRIT ix SOUTHERN 
HISTORICAL, WRITING.* 



Of the fifteen essays contained in the Dun- 
ning testimonial volume of " Studies in South- 
ern History and Politics " all but two or three 
have for their subjects some phase of the Civil 
War and Reconstruction Period and the race 
question. This is natural, since most of the 
authors are of southern birth, and nearly 
every southern historian is primarily inter- 
ested in the Civil War and the questions which 
came into being as a result of it. 

The general editor of the volume is Profes- 
sor J. W. Garner of the Department of Politi- 
cal Science in the University of Illinois. He 
is also the author of the concluding essay, 
".Southern Politics since the Civil War." Pro- 
fessor Garner's main thesis in this essay is that 
the agitation of the negro question by political 
demagogues in the South has been of infinite 
harm to both races, and hence ought to come to 
an end. In fact, he is optimistic enough to 
believe that such agitation is now nearing its 
close, as the southern people are becoming 
heartily tired of it. Though one may well 
agree with this opinion, and hope that the 
elimination of the race question from southern 
politics is near at hand, there are those who 
by no means agree with Professor Garner in 
thinking that the resulting two-party system is 
essential to the normal and successful func- 
tioning of popular government, and that its 
absence tends to render the political life of a 
community stagnant and lacking in vitality. 
Undoubtedly the South has a number of things 
the matter with it, but certainly the absence 
of the two-party system is not one of them. 

The two most interesting essays in the vol- 
ume are those written by Professors Holland 
Thompson, of the College of the City of New 
York, and William K. Boyd, of Trinity Col- 
lege, North Carolina. In a sane, unemotional, 
and scholarly way these two essays deal re- 
spectively with " The New South, Economic 
and Social " and " Some Phases of Educational 
History in the South since 1865." In a concise 
but entirely illuminating manner, Professors 
Thompson and Boyd analyze the various fac- 
tors that have helped or hindered the progress

of the South along economic or educational 
lines. It is indeed refreshing to find at least 
two young southerners of undoubted talent 
and ability breaking away from the idea that 
everything of historical importance in their 
section concerns itself with the problems aris- 
ing out of slavery and its overthrow, and 
devoting themselves to matters of greater pres- 
ent-day importance. In saying this the re- 
viewer does not mean to disparage the other 
essays in the volume. It is certainly important 
and indeed necessary, both for the South and 
for the North, that the history of slavery and 
the Civil War should be rewritten by southern- 
ers trained in historical research as the authors 
of these essays have been trained. They have 
approached their subjects not as partisan 
southerners whose purpose it was to vindicate 
or defend, but rather with sympathy purged 
of bias and sectionalism; and in this spirit 
they have all succeeded in adding something of 
real scholarship to the body of southern his- 
torical literature. 

In the opening essay, on " Deportation and 
Colonization: An Attempted Solution of the 
Race Problem," Professor W. L. Fleming of 
Louisiana State University shows that though 
such a solution of the race problem has been 
advocated by people as prominent as Jefferson 
and Lincoln and a great many others since 
1770, the scheme has never had any sort of 
chance to succeed, due mainly to the opposition 
of white employers of negro labor. Undoubt- 
edly there is a great deal of truth in Professor 
Fleming's witty remark that " every white man 
would be glad to have the entire black race 
deported except his own laborers." 

In " The Literary Movement for Secession," 
Professor Ulrich B. Phillips of the University 
of Michigan maintains the thesis that "state 
rights, while often harped upon, were in the 
main not an object of devotion for their own 
sake; but as a means of securing southern 
rights. State sovereignty was used to give the 
insignia of legality to a stroke for national 
independence." Professor Phillips arrives at 
this conclusion from an exhaustive study of 
the southern pamphlet literature written dur- 
ing the ten or twelve years preceding secession, 
and thereby proves to be a fact what was often 
suspected as having been the case. 

Professor J. G. de R. Hamilton of North 
Carolina University, in " Southern Legislation 
in Respect to Freedmen, 1865-1866," states 
comprehensively and fairly for the first time 
the essence of all the southern " black codes," 
which, either from ignorance or crass partisan- 
ship, have been very much misrepresented and 
misunderstood. From the southern point of 
view, but with no attempt to excuse or extenu- 



ate obviously unjust and unnecessary restric- 
tions on the liberties of the negroes, Professor 
Hamilton shows that the legislation in respect 
to f reedmen during the two years following the 
close of the war was on the whole a sincere, and 
for the most part, an intelligent attempt to fix 
the legal and economic status of the four mil- 
lion ex-slaves, who from the very nature of the 
case were destined to continue for a time at 
least in a position of actual inferiority to the 
great body of white people about them. In 
conclusion, Professor Hamilton expresses the 
opinion that Blaine, in his " Twenty Years of 
Congress," and many other writers have either 
wilfully or ignorantly misrepresented the facts 
in giving as a reason for the radical recon- 
struction policy the prior enactment of the 
"black codes." He thinks that the radical 
policy had been determined upon before the 
" black codes " were passed, and consequently 
its shape was not much affected by these codes. 
However, by misrepresenting the codes and 
distorting them before the public as a rebel 
attempt to reenslave the negroes, the Radicals 
were thereby enabled to make a great deal of 
use of them in securing the success of their 
policy.

THE DIAL 



[ May 27 



RECENT FICTION.* 

Miss Ethel Dell, in "The Keeper of the 
Door," once more brings us into the compan- 
ionship of Nick Ratcliffe, whose Indian ex- 
ploits and rocky road of love held us breathless 
in " The Way of an Eagle." He is now living 
in England, a Member of Parliament, held in 
immense respect for his Indian record. The 
position of hero in the new story is not, how- 
ever, reserved for him, but is given to Max 
Wyndham, a young physician, to whom many 
of his characteristics are transferred, while 
his niece and pal, Olga Ratcliffe, provides the 
book with an adorable heroine. The story is a 
very long one made so by the wilderness of 
small talk which exasperatingly clogs its action 
and it is a long time before the narrative 
gets anywhere. About midway, the scene 
shifts from England to India, where it remains 
almost until the end, and where some exciting 
things happen. Nick is sent by the govern- 
ment to look after the affairs of a rebellious 
native state, and Olga goes with him. Still, 
the interest even there is one of personal psy- 
chology rather than of objective incident, al- 
though there is one episode of a tiger and 
another of a bomb. Max Wyndham is "the 
keeper of the door " in a symbolical sense ; that 
is, as a physician he has the power of life and 
death in his hands, and possesses the secret of 
a mysterious and potent drug referred to as 
" the pain-killer," which figures in the plot in 
a very critical way. Overwrought with grief 
for a girl-friend threatened with a hideous 
form of insanity, Olga gives her the relief 
which is death by an overdose of this medicine, 
and then falls into a delirious illness which 
obliterates from her mind all recollection of 
what has happened. Later, malicious tongues 
persuade her that her friend's life has been 
lost through the unprofessional conduct of 
Max, whereupon she breaks off her engage- 
ment with him. The truth is revealed to her 
when she revisits the scene of the girl's death, 
and the gap in her memory is suddenly re- 
paired. It is Max who triumphs in the end, 
although Olga has meanwhile given her heart 
to his very engaging brother Noel, whose suf- 
ferings in her service and eventual disappoint- 
ment in her loss make a heavy draft upon our 
sympathies. The novel has an overplus of 
sentiment, and is spun out to much too great 
a length, but its interest is cumulative, and it

grows more tense and exciting with every 
added chapter. 

A really ingenious detective story, which 
does not stretch the long arm of coincidence to 
a freakish length, and which does not contrive 
difficulties obviously insurmountable except by 
impossible devices, offers one of the best forms 
of entertainment. Such a story, supported by 
crisp telling and swift dramatic action, is 
found in Mr. Arthur Stringer's " The Hand of 
Peril." It tells of the tracking of a gang of 
counterfeiters and forgers to their secret quar- 
ters in Paris, Palermo, New York, and Rome, 
with their final discomfiture at the hands of a 
secret service agent of the federal government. 
The extraordinary success of these rascals is 
due to the fine artistic faculty of a young 
woman, whom they have trained from her 
youth as an expert with the brush, the pen, 
and the engraving needle. Her forged docu- 
ments and her plates are so carefully executed 
that they deceive all but the best qualified of 
experts, and constitute a grave international 
peril. She does the work because she is in the 
power of the arch-scoundrel, who poses as her 
father, and persuades her that she has been 
guilty of murder. She is an unwilling but 
faithful tool of this villainy until she learns 
how she has been deceived. When Kestner, the 
secret service man, gets on her trail, he discov- 
ers in her a woman to be loved, and in their 
first encounter she saves his life. After being 
baffled many times in many parts of the world, 
Kestner is at last successful in breaking up 
the gang and in winning the woman. He is 
a detective of superhuman cunning and re- 
sourcefulness, and has one hairbreadth escape 
after another. The story is one which gives 
comforting attention to the details which are 
so apt to be neglected in fiction of this descrip- 
tion, and the interest is absorbing. 

Mr. Warwick Deeping is an accomplished 
story-teller, but we could wish that he dealt 
more with modern life than with the artificial 
conditions imposed by scenes and actions 
placed in the remote past. In " Marriage by 
Conquest," we have no direct time-indications, 
but we learn, by gradual degrees, and from 
various suggestions of costume and custom and 
social manner, that it is a story of the eight- 
eenth century, in which the author has pre- 
viously shown himself to be very much at 
home. The scene is Sussex, and the leading 
characters are three in number. First, there is 
Stella Shenstone, the widowed chatelaine of 
Stonehill, young and beautiful, but hardened 
into cynicism by her experience of men. Then 
there is her ferocious and unscrupulous wooer, 
Sir Richard Heron of Rush Heath, who pur- 
sues her with insolent arrogance, and makes

himself a terror to all other men who seek her 
favor. Finally, there is John Flambard of 
Chevrons, a gentleman by instinct and a 
scholar by choice, who comes unexpectedly into 
his English inheritance, and is very much out 
of place in the society of the loutish Sussex 
gentry who are his neighbors. He wins the 
love of the fair Stella, who recovers through 
his companionship her lost faith in mankind, 
and he meets the bullying pretensions of his 
rival with a fine display of moral courage rein- 
forced by thews that make him a formidable 
antagonist. Sir Richard, who grows more and 
more loathsome as his character is revealed, is 
defeated in his machinations, and even the 
seeming success of his dastardly assault upon 
the hero is turned to the credit of the latter, 
when Stella rises magnificently to the occasion, 
and brings some stinging truths home to those 
who have abetted the persecution of her lover. 
The scene in which she confronts the men who 
have, at the malignant instance of the villain, 
conspired to compass the humiliation of the 
hero, is a fine example of vivid dramatic action. 
The whole story is conceived in the romantic 
spirit, and is related with both vigor and 
eloquence. 

The story of the Moors in Spain seemed to 
us the sum of all romance in the days when 
Washington Irving was a best-seller. Since 
his time, few romantic writers have ventured 
to intrude upon the domain which he made his 
own, and the book called " Daybreak," by Miss 
Elizabeth Miller (Mrs. Hack) comes to us 
almost as a novelty. That the glamour of 
those scenes and days has not faded beyond the 
power of revivification is made evident by this 
brilliant romance of the time of Ferdinand 
and Isabella and of the Genoese whose idee fixe 
opened a new epoch in the world's history. | 
These are the figures that emerge from the 
throngs that people the narrative, which is 
immediately concerned with the siege and fall 
of Granada. The private romance is supplied 
by the love of Don Beltran Ponce de Leon for 
a high-born damsel who is Ferdinand's ward, 
and who, for reasons of state, is to be forced 
into an unwilling marriage. But love laughs 
at locksmiths and all other persons who at- 
tempt to divert its course, and the close of 
"Daybreak" finds the lovers escaped from 
court and convent and Inquisition, the lady a 
refugee in Tangier, the hero a companion of 
Columbus on the Santa Maria. A brief final 
chapter brings them together in the Moorish 
city, and it is left to be surmised that the only 
vicissitudes yet in store for them are of the 
marital description which romantic novelists, 
as a rule, are prudent enough to avoid. 

WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

The Baroness von Heyking, who wrote " The Let- 
ters Which Never Reached Him," has given a most 
interesting picture of Prussian domestic and diplo- 
matic life in her newer novel, " Lovers in Exile " 
(Button). After a purely conventional marriage 
into a typical Junker family, the heroine meets and 
loves a young man in the ministry of foreign affairs. 
She has courage enough to divorce her disagreeable 
husband and marry according to the dictates of her 
heart. The vengeance of the Junkers follows him 
in his career; and at last, after he is compelled to 
bear the burden of an international blunder in what 
can be quite certainly identified as the Venezuelan 
incident, he is driven into obscurity. It is a 
well written story, and one of unusual interest 
to the many who are studying German national 
psychology. 

For " The Valley of Tear" (Doran) Sir Arthur 
Conan Doyle has taken the resuscitated Sherlock 
Holmes and given him a typical murder mystery 
to solve in the first half of the interesting story. 
For the latter half, he deals with the Molly 
Maguire atrocities of the 'seventies, the astute and 
fearless James McParlan of the Pinkerton de- 
tective agency figuring as the hero under an as- 
sumed name, the author evidently finding the 
horrid realities disclosed at the trial of the prin- 
cipals beyond any powers of invention he himself 
possesses. Indeed, to a generation ignorant of the 
facts, Dr. Doyle will be thought lacking in plausi- 
bility, so steeped in savagery were the Pennsyl- 
vania miners implicated and punished. 

Old fashioned in the treatment of its characters 
and its attitude toward life, Mrs. Amelia E. Barr's 
" The Winning of Lucia " ( Appleton) has been 
written quite evidently for that young person whom 
we had supposed was shocked out of existence sev- 
eral years ago. A young man " with enough of the 
devil in him to keep the devil out " loses Lucia to a 
somewhat mephistophelian nobleman, who turns out 
to be rather soft after great expectations had been 
aroused concerning his hardness. After a series of 
postponements, both of betrothal and marriage, the 
young man, having amassed a fortune in specula- 
tion, marries the fair Lucia, also enriched by the 
nobleman's selection of her as his heiress. It is a 
mild and uninjurious story. 

"Dr. Syn : A Smuggler Tale of Romney Marsh " 
(Doubleday) is a rollicking, murderous tale of the 
early years of the last century, in which the protag- 
onist, an old pirate disguised as a clergyman, 
matches his wits against those of a King's officer 
and is eventually worsted. There is nothing dis- 
tantly resembling a normal human being in the 
narrative, and there is little done that any normal 
being thinks could be done. The scene is as strange 
as the deeds set in it, the whole constituting a 
thorough-going melodrama of the most sensational 
sort. 

M. Henry Bordeaux's story of " Les Roquevil- 
lard " has been ably translated by Mr. Pitts Duffield 
and given the title of " The Will to Live " (Duf- 
field ) . It deals with the unity of an ancient family, 
dishonored by a youthful son of the house ; and the

collective grief of the kinsfolk is depicted with fine 
understanding and vigor. The disgrace comes from 
an elopement with a married woman, who takes the 
dowry her elderly doting husband has settled upon 
her. For revenge the deserted man accuses the 
youth of the theft. Eventually found not guilty 
through the father's eloquent plea in court, the 
whole circle of his relatives are compelled to suffer 
with him. The book will command both attention 
and respect. 

Quite typically American are the attributes given 
by Mr. Holworthy Hall to the collegians who figure 
in his "Pepper" (Century Co.). The hero of the 
undergraduate episodes at Harvard here recounted 
is from Chicago, which will perhaps account for his 
being so successful in making money, both for him- 
self in a moment of necessity and for others in their 
want. He does not need it, ordinarily speaking, 
for his father is rich ; but he has a wide fertility of 
resource which wins him the respect of his asso- 
ciates and generally the affection of those whom he 
so cleverly befriends. It is an entertaining work, 
bubbling over with the spirit of youth. 

As many bewildering incidents as can well be 
crowded into the pages of a single short book make 
Mr. John Selborne's "The Thousand Secrets" 
(Kennerley) rather bewildering reading. It begins 
with a mysterious murder, almost immediately com- 
plicated with international troubles between Great 
Britain, where the scene is variously laid, and two 
other nations, pseudonymously named. A puny 
love affair rather detracts from than adds to the 
interest of the book, which is written quite frankly 
for purposes of mere pastime. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



International 
perspective 
in criticism. 



To the rapidly increasing list of 
books dealing with what will in 
due time come to be recognized 
as a new genre in the fine art of literature, an 
admirable addition has lately been made in 
Mr. Gustav Pollak's "International Perspec- 
tive in Criticism" (Dodd). The volume is a 
well chosen compilation of extracts from 
Goethe, Grillparzer, Sainte-Beuve, and Lowell 
dealing with great figures in the literatures of 
England, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, with 
the literature of antiquity, with definitions of 
a " classic," and with philosophy and religion. 
For the most part these authors are allowed to 
speak for themselves. But Mr. Pollak has 
some good things to say about Goethe's inter- 
national sympathies. Grillparzer's relentless 
habit of severe self-scrutiny and steadfast 
belief in a drama of democracy, Sainte-Beuve's 
alert curiosity and wide-ranging sympathies, 
and Lowell's admirable reconciliation of what 
are opposites to the small mind, patriotism and 
cosmopolitanism. At the close, in a section 
called "Messages from the Masters," Mr. Pol- 
lak points out that in these men the " critical " 



faculty seems in no wise to have stunted their 
" creative " energy. He dwells on their " in- 
cessant and passionate endeavour to hold up 
to their countrymen the great models of for- 
eign literatures, in order to bring home to 
them the excellence of their own great writ- 
ers," their steadfast rejection of the " mediocre 
and ignoble," their "wholesome dread of 
pedantry " combined with their " steady pur- 
suit of wisdom," their realization of the fact 
that individual " liberties " mean often collec- 
tive enslavement, their desire that their own 
countries should see themselves as others see 
them and thus rise above " blind chauvinism." 
The reading of these men fills Mr. Pollak with 
grave fears that " the restlessness of modern 
endeavour " in art and all other forms of life 
" betokens only weakness." As one turns the 
really liberating pages of this volume one is 
tempted to make from it many fruitful though 
perhaps fantastic deductions: that the critic 
is the most international in spirit among all 
artists, as the poet has tended to be the most 
national; that imperialism and national alli- 
ances are but crude forms of cosmopolitanism 
viewed from the wrong side ; that Oscar Wilde 
was, for the moment, wiser than any diplomat 
when he said that we might well some day 
refuse to make war on France because of her 
beautiful prose; that the critic is a truer 
patriot than the imperialist because the im- 
perialist thinks that his country has a divine 
wisdom which she must crudely superimpose 
upon the world, while the critic is so proud of 
his own country that he despises her limita- 
tions and would make her grow rich through 
the absorption of the best traits of her sister 
countries, to find herself by losing herself, and 
to discover that just as there is no real quarrel 
between egoism and altruism (for the indi- 
vidual must improve the community in order 
to improve himself, and he cannot improve 
himself without improving the community) so 
there is no real contention between the group- 
individual, nationalism, and cosmopolitanism.

(Long-mans) , by Mr. Arthur Christopher Ben- 
son, the eldest of the three. It is an affectionate, 
graceful, admiring but by no means indis- 
criminately laudatory tribute to the memory 
of an interesting and lovable and strongly 
marked character; and the human quality of 
the book throughout, its attention to little 
homely details, its success in making both the 
boy Hugh and the purposeful man live and 
breathe before us, will win for it the praise 
accorded to all biography written with insight 
and carrying with it the sense of truth to real- 
ity. The more formal and detailed account 
of Monsignor Benson's life and w r ork, espe- 
cially in his character of priest, will appear 
later from the hand of his friend and co- 
religionist, Father C. C. Martindale, S. J. 
Meanwhile the reader is admitted to some de- 
lightful intimacies by the brother who presents 
this preliminary sketch. One brief passage 
from the opening chapter, describing the home 
that Father Benson had acquired for himself 
in his later years, will make evident the variety 
of talents he possessed. " Everything in the 
little domain took shape under his skilful hand 
and ingenious brain. He made most of the 
tapestries in the house with his own fingers, 
working with his friend Mr. Gabriel Pippet, 
the artist. He carved much of the panelling 
he was extraordinarily clever with his hands. 
He painted many of the pictures which hang 
on the walls, he catalogued the library; he 
worked day after day in the garden, weeding, 
mowing, and planting." Not the least of the 
book's charms is the striking manner in which 
it incidentally reveals the extent to which 
autobiography has entered into Robert Hugh 
Benson's works of fiction, though this revela- 
tion is in no sense a surprise. The final im- 
pression of the memoir is of one who high- 
heartedly and with intense earnestness entered 
into the tremendous game of life, and played 
his part nobly and zestfully to the very end. 
Glad did he live and gladly die, and he laid 
him down with a will. Of portraits and other 
illustrations the book has no lack. No more 
sincere or engrossing piece of writing has come 
from its author's pen. 



The oldest and Mr - George P. Upton has done 
most enduring another good service tor music 

form of music. 



(McClurg). The subject is an especially in- 
teresting one. The spontaneous utterance of 
the race in music has been chiefly in the song. 
Among all nations have been found these free 
expressions of feeling. They have varied in 
form, in rhythm, in color, with the changing 
skies under which they have been produced. 
They have been embodiments of all the emo- 



tions which fill the hearts of mankind. They 
have been the rich and lavish material to which 
the learned composers have gone for themes 
which could be worked up into imposing 
musical structures. They have voiced the 
hopes, the fears, the aspirations of mankind 
from the earliest periods. They are to-day as 
living as they ever were, and they constitute 
the music which everyone understands and 
which everyone enjoys. Mr. Upton thus ex- 
plains the purpose of his book : " In carrying 
out his scheme the author has confined his 
selection and classes to song in the English 
tongue, making little reference to songs of 
other countries, except in chapters relating to 
their origin and evolution. He has also sought 
to trace the various functions of the song, and 
to attempt to explain why some of the simplest 
of the old songs live on, generation after gen- 
eration, as fresh and forceful as when they 
were written, while so many of the higher and 
more elaborate musical forms perish or are 
soon forgotten. In a word, the writer has 
sought to present the story, the psychology, 
and mission of the song, the oldest and most 
enduring form of music." It would be easy, 
in making such an effort, to become lost in the 
multiplicity of details and, while being ade- 
quately encyclopaedic, to fail sadly in keeping 
up the indubitable interest of the subject. No 
such disaster has overtaken the present author. 
Our enjoyment waxes as we proceed, and the 
value of the book is enhanced by the manner 
of presentation. Our old favorites appear 
unshorn of the attraction which they have 
always possessed. We learn a good deal of the 
peoples who have here so clearly and unre- 
servedly manifested themselves. We may not 
entirely give ourselves up to their intense and 
sanguinary developments of patriotic devotion 
to the fatherland; but for unhampered im- 
mersion in the domestic affections, for the 
delight in the simple amusements of daily 
life, for the hymning of the higher experiences, 
we can have only sympathy and gratitude. 
The many who love the old songs will assur- 
edly give this book a cordial welcome. 



Ten "studies of extravagance"

Little Man, and Other Satires" (Scribner). 
So vividly are they portrayed that the types 
depicted in these pen-sketches seem to stand 
forth like so many bronze statues one has come 
upon unexpectedly out in the open. Whole 
sentences linger in the mind long after the 
book is laid aside. For instance, there is the 
artist who declares that it does not matter 
whether you have anything to express, so long

as you express it ; the young woman who flings 
open all the doors of life, and is so continually 
going out and coming in that life has con- 
siderable difficulty in catching a glimpse of 
her at all ; the perfect one who had heard of 
" the people," and, indeed, at times had seen 
and smelt them; and the superlative whose 
poet was Blake, whose novelist was Dostoiev- 
sky, and whose playwright was Strindberg, for 
who else was there who had gone outside the 
range of normal, stupid, rational humanity, 
and shown the marvellous qualities of the 
human creature drunk or dreaming 1 ? It is 
given to few artists to reveal the soul with 
Mr. Galsw r orthy's penetration, to write with 
his brilliance. "A Simple Tale," one of the 
short stories of the volume, contains a weird 
and unforgettable character, near kin to Mr. 
Stone of "Fraternity" and the very shadow 
of old age itself, who thinks himself the Wan- 
dering Jew. The title piece is a whimsical 
satire, having for its characters an English- 
man and his wife, an American, a German, 
the Little Man, and a woman with two bundles 
and a baby, who are waiting for their train on 
an Austrian railway platform. The men are 
trying to find a definition for true heroism. 
Catastrophe befalls the Little Man, the only 
one who attempts to put theory into practice ; 
but Fate is at hand to throw in one of her 
happy endings (she has robbed so many lives 
of them that she ought to have them to squan- 
der), and the curtain falls as the American 
snaps his kodak on the sobered group. Just 
what, we begin to wonder, is the significance 
of all this ? Can it be that Mr. Galsworthy is 
trying to say that it is just as heroic to lug a 
baby and two bundles for a woman crying in 
distress, as, let us say, to steer a Zeppelin 

over ? But we are on forbidden ground. 

In a warning note the author states expressly 
that the piece was written in 1913, and has 
nothing whatever to do, however darkly and 
deeply, with the Great War. 



The problem 
of sex control. 



The perennial problem of the 
control of the determination of 
sex never loses interest, partly 
because of its relations to the economic inter- 
ests of the animal breeder and partly by rea- 
son of its ever present appeal to parents. The 
progress of biological inquiry into the struc- 
ture and behavior of the sex cells, the trans- 
mission of hereditary characters from parents 
to children, and the application of the experi- 
mental method to the modification of sexual 
characters and to the control of sex among 
animals, have brought to light a great mass 
of data, much of it obscure in its significance, 
not a little of it conflicting in character, and 



practically all of it suggesting several differ- 
ent conclusions. Out of this confusion some 
general results are emerging which point the 
way for further investigation rather than 
afford generalizations of sweeping import. 
Dr. L. Doncaster, of King's College, Cam- 
bridge, has set forth these results in his 
" Determination of Sex " (Putnam) in a criti- 
cal and constructive way. supplementing the 
data of others by his own interpretations and 
suggestions. His work is of necessity some- 
what technical and highly specialized, though 
the glossary and the simplicity and clarity of 
his style will assist the non-technical reader 
through the mazes of chromosomes, hetero- 
zygotes, and gynandromorphs. The topics 
discussed include the nature and functions of 
sex, the stage of development at which sex is 
determined, sex-limited inheritance, the sex 
ratio, identical twins, secondary sexual char- 
acters, the transmission of secondary sexual 
characters, hermaphroditism, and the deter- 
mination of sex in man. With regard to the 
last, the author inclines to the view that, 
although the problem is far from solution, 
there is still hope for an ultimate victory. 



short and Transitory but vivid glimpses of 

simple annais a succession of characters from 
of the poor. common Hf e make up the sub- 
stance of " Eight O'clock and Other Studies " 
(Macmillan), by Mr. St. John G. Ervine. 
Humble and to an unobservant eye uninter- 
esting, these representatives of the poorer 
classes in London, Dublin, County Antrim, 
and elsewhere, become instinct with meaning 
in the discerning author's hands : and the les- 
son, or one of the lessons, that he unobtrusively 
and undidactically teaches is the pathetic 
dreariness of life to those unfortunates who 
have no inner resources of their own, while by 
implication the richness and wonderfulness of 
existence to the uncramped soul are made to 
stand out in glowing relief. Amusing but 
pitiful is the aspect of the bookseller's assistant 
encountered by the writer in Kew Gardens 
and sounded with ludicrous lack of response 
on various subjects, including books; and 
when a final desperate appeal was made to his 
ambition (if he had any) , " for the first time a 
look of yearning came into his eyes, and he 
stared steadily in front of him for a second or 
so. ' Yes.' he said, after a little while, ' some- 
times I think it would be nice to have two 
pounds a week certain/" Equally touching 
is the spectacle of Mr. Martin, a workingman 
who has scraped together a competence and 
retired from the drudgery of daily toil to the 
tedium of perpetual idleness. To go "for a 
walk in the Square, and look at the shops," is

the utmost extent of his recreational capabili- 
ties. Previous appearance of some of these 
sketches in such journals as the Manchester 
" Guardian," the London " Nation," " Sunday 
Chronicle," "New Statesman," and "Irish 
Independent" is a sort of guarantee, if one 
asks for it, of their good quality. 

The civilization Tt ls Difficult to foresee what 

of India, ckina, f orm will be assumed by reports 
of the fortunate holders of Kahn 
fellowships as their numbers increase with the 
passing years. It is appalling to think of their 
publication, if they once become fixed in type. 
In fact, we are almost ready to declare that 
no man should be allowed to go around the 
world, unless he will bind himself not to pub- 
lish anything about his trip for five years 
after he returns. However, the latest report 
to the Kahn trustees need give no ground for 
apprehension, inasmuch as it comes from the 
well known English writer, Mr. G. Lowes Dick- 
inson, who has wisely refrained from describ- 
ing his journey in detail and has offered 
instead " some reflections on the general spirit 
and character of the civilization of India, 
China, and Japan; and the apparent and 
probable effects upon these civilizations of 
contact with the West." His essay, which is 
divided into three parts and a conclusion, fills 
less than ninety rather small pages ; but every 
paragraph is thoughtful and suggestive. In 
fact, the tiny volume contains much more 
mental pabulum than is to be found in many 
bulkier productions, and is well worth read- 
ing. At the same time we ought to note that it 
will not offer much that is essentially new 
to those who are familiar with the author's 
"Appearances," reviewed at some length in 
our issue of December 16 last. It is hardly 
necessary to add that Mr. Dickinson's hand 
has lost nothing of its cunning, and that the 
essay is a delightful example of style. (Dou- 
bleday, Page & Co.) 

Some romantic he old Sailing ships whidl 

chapters in the found their finest type at last in

counterpart in English nautical history in 
"The Old East Indiamen," to which Lieuten- 
ant E. Keble Chatterton, R.N.V.R., devotes 
an entertaining and fully illustrated volume 
(Lippincott). Previous works by the same 
writer attest both his interest and his qualifi- 
cations ; and in his new book he has added a 
series of chapters to the annals of the sea 
which needed to be particularized. Begin- 
ning with the first operations of the East 
India Company, after a survey of the voy- 
ages and discoveries that made the Company 
possible, carrying his tale from the pages 



of Hakluyt down into the last century, when 
the monopoly of the Company was taken from 
it and the need for maintaining a fleet of 
ships, most of them well armed against 
pirates, privateers, and the ships of European 
enemies, ceased, he buttresses the late Ad- 
miral Mahan's theory of sea power from one 
cover to another. There was fighting enough 
in the old days, and on at least one occasion 
the East Indiamen proved too powerful for 
a French squadron. Something might have 
been said about the various flags and ensigns 
shown in the numerous pictures of these gal- 
lant old craft, the more so as facing page 
78 is a flag identical with the one flown at 
Washington's headquarters at Cambridge in 
1775, with the Union Jack and thirteen 
stripes, apparently red and white. The work 
sadly needs an index. 



The making Professor George M. Priest of 
of modern Princeton has written a lucid 
and interesting history of " Ger- 
many since 1740" (Ginn), which will doubt- 
less find many readers in the present posture 
of international affairs. The difficult task of 
writing an historical narrative where there is, 
for the most part, no one focal point, is here 
solved with considerable skill. The slow 
amalgamation of the scattered and impotent 
German states into one of the greatest powers 
in human history may be followed clearly in 
this book of two hundred pages, from which 
superfluous facts have been carefully elimi- 
nated. The tone of the writer is sympathetic 
but critical. His detachment becomes espe- 
cially observable in the latter part of the book, 
where he has to deal with the amazing com- 
mercial and industrial development of Ger- 
many which has imparted such a sinister 
materialistic aspect to life there. The worship 
of force, a legacy from Bismarck, has been 
further fostered by this consciousness of eco- 
nomic strength, and has tended to overshadow 
other elements in the German character. Its 
fruition is the present war, for which Ger- 
many is, in the author's opinion, only proxi- 
mately to blame, the fundamental guilt being 
shared, at least to some extent, by the other 
great powers of Europe. For the general 
reader, Professor Priest's book is the most 
commendable account extant of the develop- 
ment of what is just now the most interesting, 
though not the best beloved, country in the 
world.

vertebrates. The reptile house at the zoologi- 
cal garden is full of attraction, not only 
because of its potentialities in hair-raising 
thrills but also because of its varied interests 
which increase greatly with acquaintance. 
Mr. E. G. Boulenger's volume entitled " Rep- 
tiles and Batrachians " (Dutton) is based 
upon the author's experience as curator of 
the famous collection of lower vertebrates in 
the Zoological Gardens of the Zoological So- 
ciety in Regent's Park, London. It gives a 
general account of the classification of these 
two groups of animals, with a brief discussion 
of the more interesting facts of natural his- 
tory pertaining to the representative reptiles, 
the crocodiles, alligators, lizards, slowworms, 
turtles, tortoises, and snakes of the world, and 
likewise of the amphibians including the frogs, 
toads, tree-toads, salamanders, and water pup- 
pies. It discusses distribution, food and feed- 
ing habits, life history, behavior, poison fangs 
and poisons, and breeding habits, affording a 
mine of trustworthy information on a wide 
range of forms. The book deals with leading 
species from all continents, and includes a con- 
siderable number of American species. It is 
illustrated with one hundred and seventy-six 
plates, mostly reproductions from original 
photographs of living animals made by Mr. 
W. S. Berridge.

An anthology nag ma( J e a judicious Selection 
of modern plays. J . 

oi plays tor his anthology 01 
"Chief Contemporary Dramatists" (Hough- 
ton) . Allowing for the exigencies of copyright, 
of author's permission in several cases, of 
accessibility in translation, the dramas in- 
cluded are as nearly representative as any 
group so arbitrarily chosen could possibly be. 
By a somewhat daring and curious turn of 
logic, the editor explains that Ibsen was omit- 
ted because he is too much the pioneer of the 
contemporary movement, too fully its source 
and exemplar. The omission of representative 
plays by Shaw and Barrie is enforced. En- 
glish drama is represented by Wilde, Pinero, 
Jones, Galsworthy, and Barker; Irish by 
Yeats, Synge, and Lady Gregory; American 
by Fitch, Moody, Thomas, and MacKaye; 
Norwegian by Bjornson, Swedish by Strind- 
berg, and Russian by Tchekhov; German by 
Hauptmann and Sudermann ; and French and 
Belgian by Brieux, Hervieu, and Maeterlinck. 
Serious plays predominate; but the editor 
forestalls any criticism on this point by sug- 
gesting that it is not his fault but the fault of 
the age. The volume is carefully edited in 
detail ; its notes are concise ; its bibliographies 
are brief but adequate. That it will prove an 



indispensable handbook for students of the 
modern drama, goes without saying. An 
anthology of this kind is in itself so much a 
pioneer, so much an innovation, and it con- 
tains so much that is admirable, that to quarrel 
with its contents were like holding a grudge 
against the gods for having led us out into the 
open road, where we expected only a path. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

We are glad to note that Mr. Robert Frost's vol- 
ume of verse, " North of Boston," the English 
edition of which we reviewed in our issue of Oct. 1 
last, has been published in this country by Messrs. 
Henry Holt & Co. An American edition of Mr. 
Frost's first volume, "A Boy's Will," is also issued 
at the same time by the same publishers. 

Interest in the West, in this year of the exposi- 
tion, is not limited to California. Those who plan 
to visit America's only " geyser land " and desire a 
complete historical and descriptive guide to the 
region, will find what they seek in General Hiram 
M. Chittenden's " The Yellowstone National Park " 
(Stewart & Kidd Co.), now revised and enlarged 
and brought thoroughly up to date. 

New revised editions, in both instances the third, 
of Mr. Hubert Howe Bancroft's " The New Pacific " 
and " Retrospection " have recently been published 
by the Bancroft Co. The interest of the veteran 
Californian in men and institutions and problems 
of the day remains undiminished, and his comments 
are no less fearless or illuminating than of old. 
The two volumes are issued together in a box. 

A textbook on advertising that deals with the 
economic, psychological, and physical factors of the 
subject, as well as principles of artistic arrange- 
ment and composition in the preparation of 
" copy," has been prepared by Messrs. Harry 
Tipper, Harry L. Hollingworth, George Burton 
Hotchkiss, and Frank Alvah Parsons, each one of 
whom is qualified by experience and training for 
his task and is an expert in his field. A distinctive 
feature of the volume is the outline of an advertis- 
ing campaign in actual operation. Elaborate illus- 
trations of successful display advertising ,are 
included. (New York: The Ronald Press Co.) 

A second edition of " Routledge's New English 
Dictionary of the English Language," edited by 
Mr. Cecil Weatherley, has been issued by Messrs. 
Dutton. Some of its features are: condensation 
secured through judicious grouping of derivatives 
with the vocabulary word, which has resulted in 
the elimination of unnecessary definitions; the 
inclusion of all the principal new terms in the 
sciences and the applied and fine arts, of modern 
colloquial slang both English and American, and 
of idiomatic words with their usages; and the 
ready use for sources of the " Encyclopaedia Bri- 
tannica " and such dictionaries as the " Oxford 
English," the " Century," and the latest edition of 
Webster's " International." Convenient in size, 
and clear in typography, the volume forms a most 
desirable reference book for the desk or library.

Benson's volume of collected poems. 

A new collection of poems by Mr. G. K. Chester- 
ton is soon to be published. This book will contain 
war poems, including " Lepanto " ; love poems ; 
religious poems; ballades; and a section of 
" Rhymes for the Times," serious and gay. 

Into a volume entitled "A German-American's 
Confession of Faith," Professor Kuno Francke

by Mr. H. Addington Bruce. 

Mrs. Rosa Newmarch, author of a recent book 
on "The Russian Opera," will have a companion 
volume ready next month on " The Russian Arts," 
the main object of which is to show how the soul 
of the people is revealed not only in their literature 
and music, but also in their iconography, modern 
painting, sculpture, architecture, and ornamenta- 
tion. 



" German Philosophy and Politics," by Profes- 
sor John Dewey, traces for the unprofessional 
reader the development of classical German philos- 
ophy from Kant to Hegel. The volume will be

Petrarch," translated and annotated by Dr. W. D. 
Foulke, who has also contributed a lengthy memoir 
of the poet by way of introduction. Only a portion 
of the canzoniere is included, Dr. Foulke having 
omitted all which did not seem to him to represent 
Petrarch at his best. 

Three new volumes are in preparation for the 
" Quest Series," edited by Mr. G. R. S. Mead and 
published by the Macmillan Co. They are " The 
Ethical and Social Significance of Personality " by 
Professor William Brown, " Catholic Mysticism " 
by Baron Friedrich Von Hugel, and " The Inter- 
pretation of Nature from Aristotle to Bergson" 
by Professor J. Arthur Thomson. 

Mr. A. P. Goudy, Lecturer in Russian in the 
University of Cambridge, and Mr. E. Bullough, of 
Gonville and Caius College, are editing for the 
Cambridge University Press a series of Russian 
texts, each volume to consist of about 750 pages, 
with notes and vocabulary. The first three vol- 
umes of the series will be Pushkin's " Godunov," 
Tolstoy's " Sevastopol," and Dostoevsky's " Poor 
People." 

A second series of studies of " French Novelists 
of To-day," by Miss Winifred Stephens, is soon to 
appear. An introduction will deal with the French 
novel on the eve of the war, and the change that has 
come over the life and literature of France during 
the last twenty years. Separate chapters are de- 
voted to Marcelle Tinayre, Romain Rolland, Jean 
Tharaud, Jerome Tharaud, Rene Boylesve, Pierre 
Mille, and Jean Aicard. As in the earlier series, the 
bibliographies at the beginning of the studies are 
not restricted to works of fiction. 

An edition of Henry Vaughan's poems, to be 
published shortly by the Oxford University Press, 
will contain as an appendix eleven of Vaughan's 
letters which have been recently discovered. They 
were written to John Aubrey and Anthony Wood, 
and they add something to our knowledge of a poet 
about whose biography less has hitherto been known 
than about any of the other Caroline or Jacobean 
poets of his rank. Mr. L. C. Martin, who edits the 
volume, has also made the first authentic collation 
of the text of the poems. 

Edward Cook, a prominent member of the old- 
time publishing fraternity of Chicago, died on the 
20th inst., at his home in Oak Park, Illinois. Mr. 
Cook came to Chicago in 1860. He was one of the 
organizers of the publishing house of Ivison, 
Blakeman & Taylor, which later became part of 
the American Book Company. For several years 
he was a partner in the publishing firm of Jansen, 
McClurg & Co., later A. C. McClurg & Co. He 
was a prominent member of the Masonic order,

and wrote much of the Masonic law for Masons of 
Illinois. He was a trustee of Scoville Institute of 
Oak Park, and a member of the Sons of the Amer- 
ican Revolution. 

A recent announcement of the Doves Press con- 
tains the following : " The Great War has not been 
' forgotten ' or ' forgiven,' nor is it even finished. 
But the first shock, which seemed to obliterate both 
Past and Future and to engulf all in one foul tri- 
umph of hate, is over, and both Past and Future 
re-emerge and re-assume their reign despite the 
' inscrutable horror ' of to-day. With this larger 
outlook Mr. Cobden-Sanderson returns to his first 
intention before the war, and will in the immediate 
future print and publish the ' Lieder, Gedichte, and 
Balladen' of Germany's supreme poet, Goethe, in 
honour of Germany's better past and in hope of 
Germany's still greater future when she shall have 
sloughed off the hate which, to-day, bedarkens both 
her and our Welt-Ansicht and World- Vision." 

A minor effect of the war has been the marked 
awakening of interest in Russian literature evi- 
denced by English readers. As one result of this, 
an attempt is being made by Messrs. Hodder & 
Stoughton, in a series of " Great Russian Fiction," 
to cover the whole range of Russian imaginative 
literature in a library of uniform volumes at a 
popular price. The following works will be ready 
immediately : " The Captain's Daughter and Other 
Tales," by 'Pushkin; " On the Eve," by Turgenev; 
" The Heart of a Russian," by Lemontov ; " Little 
Angel," by Andreiev ; " In Honour's Name," by 
Kuprin ; and two of Gorky's works " Com- 
rades " and " Chelkash." It is hoped to include 
among the later volumes some novels and stories 
by Chekhov, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Gontcharov, 
Korolenko, and others. 

One year of the Index Office, a corporation not 
for pecuniary profit, organized early in 1914 " as a 
reference bureau and intermediary between libra- 
ries and the public, to perform, for a moderate 
charge, such services as libraries are not prepared 
to perform, namely, to index, compile, abstract, and 
translate such literary material as investigators 
need to have prepared for their use," seems to have 
demonstrated the usefulness of that institution, 
which at the outset was favorably noticed in these 
columns. In the initial number of its " Reference 
Bulletin," lately issued, it gives some details of its 
first year's activities. Medical students and physi- 
cians have apparently been its chief patrons, and 
they have called for a number of bibliographies and 
abstracts on subjects interesting to them. It an- 
nounces its intention to publish " Dementia Precox 
Studies " and occasional bibliographies on the sub- 
ject by Dr. Bayard Holmes. Bibliographical in- 
dexes and references fill six of the Bulletin's eight 
pages. 

In a recent issue of THE DIAL we noted the fact 
that the quarterly of Oriental study, " Le Museon," 
long published by the University of Louvain, would 
be carried on by the Cambridge University Press 
of England. The American agency for the publica- 
tion, as we now learn, has just been undertaken by 
the University of Chicago Press. Over two hun- 
dred pages of material for the third and fourth 



numbers of " Le Museon " for 1914 are supposed 
to have been lost in the fire which destroyed the 
offices of the Belgian publisher in the early days of 
August; and one of the collaborators on the last 
number of the journal was taken prisoner in the 
war and died in a hospital. All supporters of 
Oriental studies will be glad to know that the first 
issue of this journal for 1915 will soon be published, 
with contributions from many well-known conti- 
nental and English scholars; and interest in a 
review published under such unusual circumstances 
is confidently expected to be shown by American 
scholars especially interested in these fields of 
research. 

One of the most striking and unaccountable 
instances of popular neglect of a brilliant writer is 
to be found in the case of Walter Bagehot. In the 
face of this neglect it is a bold, though a most com- 
mendable, enterprise to project a complete edition 
of Bagehot's writings. Such an edition, in ten 
volumes, edited by Bagehot's sister-in-law, Mrs. 
Russell Barrington, will be published next month 
by Messrs. Longmans. Much important matter is 
now reprinted for the first time, including the first 
two articles by Bagehot which appeared in " The 
Prospective Review " in 1848, various pamphlets 
on political economy, a series of essays written in 
early youth, and a volume of selected papers from 
" The Economist," " The Saturday Review," and 
" The Spectator." The first volume of the new 
edition will include the memoir by Bagehot's life- 
long friend, Richard Holt Hutton, originally pub- 
lished in " The Fortnightly Review " and later 
reprinted as a preface to Volume I. of Bagehot's 
" Literary Studies," together with the second 
memoir by the same writer, contributed to the 
" Dictionary of National Biography." Mrs. Russell 
Barrington's memoir, which appeared a year ago, 
completes the series as Volume X.

L. P.Jacks. It is followed by several authoritative discus- 
sions of the moral and material results of the war, including 
a prophecy of the geographical and racial realignment of 
Europe. In literature, Emile Legouis of the Sorbonne 
writes of the French ideals in criticism, with especial 
lucidity. Chauncey Brewster Tinker discusses the art of 
familiar letter-writing with rich background of i8th century

A VERY IMPORTANT NEW BIOGRAPHY 

Spencer Fullerton Baird 

A BIOGRAPHY 
By WILLIAM H. DALL, A.M., D.Sc. 

The life of the great naturalist, the friend of Agassiz and 
Audubon, the head of the Smithsonian Institution, the orga- 
nizer of the Fish Commission. With much interesting corre- 
spondence with eminent men of science and military leaders. 

Svo. With 19 illustrations. Buckram, gilt top, Tincut, $3.50 net; carriage extra. 
The edition is printed from type, and no more will be published. 

Natural history in America is most of all indebted to two remarkable men, 
Professor Louis Agassiz and Professor Spencer F. Baird. 

Their activities in a public sense in this country began about the same time, 
Agassiz, the enthusiastic, inspiring teacher, and Baird, the efficient, hard working, 
and lovable organizer, complemented each other. 

Professor Baird was a born naturalist and organizer of methods and men. His 
biography is not a history of explorations nor a record of technical investigations; 
but an account of the life and relation to them of a singularly eminent, able, effi- 
cient, and modest devotee of the Natural Sciences. 

Apart from the scientific side of the activities it endeavors to make the reader 
acquainted with the characteristics of a pure and lovable leader of men to whose 
modesty and self-sacrifice the country owes a debt which is still appreciated only 
by a select few.

SELECTIONS FROM THE 
SCOTTISH PHILOSOPHY 
OF COMMON SENSE 

Edited with an Introduction 
By G. A. JOHNSTON, M. A., University of Glasgow 
Pp.268, cloth; price $1.25 

The historical significance of the Philosophy of Common 
Sense is considerable. 
For half a century the Philosophy of Common Sense 
was the dominant philosophy in American universities; and 
it is to the Scottish president of an American college (James 
McCosh of Princeton) that we owe the most comprehensive 
study of it. 
In England and Germany it has never been much 
appreciated, but in France it exercised a great influence 
through Victor Cousin (1792-1867), who made it the 
greatest power in French philosophy of the period. In 
recent years, in France, there has been a recrudescence of 
interest in the Scottish philosophy through the writings of 
Professor T. T. Laurie, who attempted, in several able 
works, a critical reconstruction of the traditional Scottish 
Natural Realism. 
The Scottish Philosophy of Common Sense originated 
as a protest against the skeptical conclusions of Hume, and 
the hypotheses found in Locke and Descartes. Thomas 
Reid was the first man to see clearly the genesis of Hume's 
skepticism, and in this little volume he gives an admirable 
account of his investigations of the principles upon which 
this skeptical system was built.

A BULL IN THE EDUCATIONAL 
CHINA-SHOP. 



There lies heavily upon our table a pamphlet 
in a neutral gray cover, containing nearly 
a thousand pages most of them in fine print, 
and bearing the innocuous title : " Report 
upon the Survey of the University of Wiscon- 
sin." This is not an ordinary official docu- 
ment ; it is a most extraordinary one. May it 
long remain unique! Democratic etiquette 
requires that public linen shall be washed in 
public. However decorous the arrangement of 
the clothes on the line, the tout ensemble is 
not inspiring. A considerable part of the 
"Survey" relates to matters of University 
housekeeping, methods, accounts, forms, ap- 
pliances, machinery, statistics; all this is no 
concern of ours. The officials responsible for 
the undertaking are "the State Board of 
Public Affairs," composed of the Governor 
and other prominent citizens. Their concise 
report is a proper statement of the university's 
policy, record, and management ; it is sporadi- 
cally critical, but sane in criticism and com- 
mendation. The facts speak adequately, and 
reflect the usual wisdom interspersed with 
myopic vision that makes educational history 
in this overgrown country of ours. The mas- 
sive bulk of the volume is the work of one 
William H. Allen, Ph.D., the official surveyor. 
The manner in which his inquisitorial task is 
accomplished necessitates a copious comple- 
ment of commentaries by various members of 
the Faculty of the surveyed university. The 
function of these commentaries is to set forth 
the versatile fallacies and to correct the com- 
prehensive distortions with which the "Allen " 
report is saturated. Thus denatured, the 
document to the discerning becomes inoffen- 
sive by becoming ridiculous; and yet it re- 
mains a tragedy in effect, a farce in execution. 

When Dr. Allen's methods are vivisected by 
shrewd and patient diagnosticians (whose 
services at the least deserve a national monu- 
ment) their barrenness is pitiable. A list of 
thirty-seven things which the dean of the 
graduate school of the much lauded University 
of Wisconsin is not expected to do, is gravely 
cited as a comprehensive arraignment of the 



446 



THE DIAL 



[ June 10 



incompetence and negligence of that officer, 
"without evidence being presented that it is 
desirable or practicable to do any one of the 
thirty-seven things." Had the dean actually 
subscribed to these thirty-seven articles, it 
would have been adequate cause in the minds 
of many to invite his resignation; and it is 
fairly probable that had he been thus guilty, 
these same " facts " of commission might have 
been cited by another " Dr. Allen " as evidence 
of the manner in which the dean wastes his 
time. The justly despairing commentator re- 
sorts to the deadly parallel: "Using the 
method of Dr. Allen, it might be said: (a) 
No attempt has been made to determine the 
average size of shoes worn by professors"; 
or the relation of the color of their hair to 
" efficiency of instruction," or of the color of 
their eyes to " efficiency in research," or 
other deadly sins of omission more than seven 
times seven. Under such irritation, sooner or 
later, even the academic spirit rebels. On 
page 197 we reach the verdict : " To resort, 
for once, to the vernacular, this is rot." More 
soberly expressed: "No statement of facts 
and no conclusion or recommendation of Dr. 
Allen can be accepted without verification." 
" The intellectual life and the life of the spirit 
are to Dr. Allen what a symphony is to the 
deaf-mute or a sunset to the blind." " The 
survey of the graduate school has been mainly 
directed to its clothes rather than to the living 
being beneath the clothes." Mis-statement, 
mis-quotation, garbled reports, direct untruth- 
fulness, insinuations, unwarranted implica- 
tions, ignorant interpretations, mechanical 
manipulation of statistics, are all charged 
against Dr. Allen ; and with a ruthless frank- 
ness, scathing in its charitable reserve, are 
proved to the hilt. Even in the handling of 
the naked sabre of statistics, the hand that 
wields the weapon receives the wound. " If 
Dr. Allen's computations are correct, more 
than 90 % of the teaching of the college costs 
less than 42 % of the salaries," a reductio ad 
absurdum. In fact, so ignorant is Dr. Allen 
of the meaning of numbers that he converts a 
cold statistical statement that class-markings 
follow the law of distribution of averages into 
a deliberate intention on the part of the in- 
structor to repress talent. 

But enough of this superfluous exhibition of 
the mischief that one stray bull in a china-shop 
can do (and be paid handsomely for his havoc) , 
and to the point : Why are these things ? Is 



the Allen report a rare and negligible patho- 
logical specimen, or is it a significant symptom 
of a prevalent disease ? How comes it that the 
legislature of a great State subjects its great- 
est institution to so unworthy and so futile 
and so expensive a procedure? Why should a 
body of scholars be harassed by 50-page ques- 
tion-sheets, and distracted by an impertinent 
and aimless " Survey " ? Why should a docu- 
ment more voluminous than President Stanley 
Hall's great two- volume work on " Educational 
Problems" (to mention the most comprehen- 
sive of recent contributions to educational 
literature) be printed and circulated as Ex- 
hibits A and B and C to Ampersand, of irrele- 
vance and obliquity? 

That " something is rotten in the state of 
Denmark" is the ready conclusion. Well! 
"Yes" and "No." Anyone acquainted with 
the uncritical manner in which decisive steps 
of this kind are taken will at once relieve those 
responsible for the " Survey " of the charge of 
any lack of good will, of appreciation of the 
higher education, or of good judgment in 
adjusting desirable ends to possible means. 
Off-hand, it seems a good thing to take stock 
and have an expert accounting. Such " goods " 
come high, but their higher sanction is Econ- 
omy with a capital E. And there's the rub! 
Commercial-mindedness has so insidiously 
eaten its way into the judicial fibre of the 
American mind, that its workings have become 
untrustworthy. So when a plausible man 
comes along with a plausible scheme to test 
the higher education, and reform its extrava- 
gance, and tabulate it, and cost-account its 
every item, and prune research and similar 
luxuries, and introduce supervised instruc- 
tion, and bring the plant up-to-date, and scrap 
its inefficient professors, one person in author- 
ity is impressed, a few more are acquiescent, 
and the scheme goes through. Of course there 
should have been a watch-dog on the grounds 
to indicate the true character of the intruder ; 
but there was not, because as a people we do 
not like alarmists any more than we like 
"knockers," and we prefer to take our fore- 
thought after something has happened. If the 
University concerned had protested, charges 
of interested motives and a fear of baring the 
truth would have been promptly imputed. No 
one expected this kind of a survey ; and it is 
only fair to admit that so extreme a genius 
for blundering must be unusual. It is hard 
luck that the result is as preposterous as it 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



447 



turned out to be; but perhaps that is the 
fortunate thing about it. If the Wisconsin 
survey serves to prevent a similar profane 
invasion of sacred territory, and thus to guar- 
antee the peace of the academic world for a 
reasonable period, the Wisconsin sacrifice will 
not have been in vain. Yet it would be rash to 
assume that this moral will be drawn univer- 
sally ; and once more, there's the rub ! 

For down at the bottom of our hearts, where 
convictions germinate, there is a suspicion of 
learning, which will not easily be uprooted. 
We are practical to the point of obsession; 
which means that we lose sight of the most 
obvious practicality in the world, in that we 
insist upon results and are impatient of means. 
But more than that: there has grown to im- 
mense proportions the newer efficiency, that 
puts forward method as a panacea, invents 
"perfect" systems, and is absorbed in mechan- 
isms and oblivious of purposes. It has made 
the business sense of the community, which 
runs things, insensitive to values. This same 
business sense accuses the professor of a lack 
of practicality, and entirely overlooks that all 
this alleged efficiency of beginning on the 
stroke of the bell and quitting when the whis- 
tle blows, and using all the class-rooms all the 
time, and reducing the cost of unit-instruction 
per student neurone, is just plain, bald, bare 
assumption. There is not a fact or a shred 
of evidence anywhere to prove that the most 
important discoveries or the best educated 
individuals come from institutions in which 
these things are carefully looked into, and that 
the neglect of them or reasonable attention to 
them has differentiated one type of institution 
from another. Then there is the peculiar in- 
fatuation with facts dressed in modern tabular 
attire, which the tailor assures you is the 
"correct" thing. So the surveyor is con- 
stantly insisting that he wants facts, facts, 
FACTS. But Tie decides what facts he wants ; 
assumption again. The size of the professor's 
shoes is a fact, and is readily ascertained. It 
has a glorious definiteness, and the curve of 
distribution would admirably prove that pro- 
fessors are not superior to, are not even differ- 
ent from, other foot-geared mortals. The 
relevancy of a fact, or the interpretation of a 
fact, is to the, practical man merely an opinion, 
not to be seriously considered. And that is 
why he is so easily taken in by plausible pre- 
sumption. He accepts labels for things, and a 
record for the experience. Of course in his 



own field he knows better ; he does not count 
all his promissory notes as equally valid assets : 
he has a pretty exact notion of what he can 
collect. 

And yet the mystery of these endless pages 
of utterly useless misconstruction remains. 
Are our universities really to be threatened 
periodically by such futile absurdities ? What 
will our foreign critics think of us ? It may be 
a joke at home, where we make allowances; 
but it becomes a shame abroad, where it travels 
on its face value. And does any person in his 
senses really believe that the cause of higher 
education, or any worthy cause whatever, can 
be advanced by industrious ant-hills of such 
petty, carping, querulous, specious pellets of 
inconsequence? Can the surveyor himself 
believe in it ; or is it more charitable to regard 
him as a fraud rather than a fool? If the 
Wisconsin survey is to take its place in history 
as an isolated case of an obscure mental dis- 
ease, it does not much matter what the answer 
may be. But if this sort of thing is going to 
break out epidemically or sporadically, we 
must find the antidote; and it may not be a 
simple matter. For the decision to have sur- 
veys rests with a small group of men ; and if 
they are susceptible to the wiles of special 
pleaders, there is little hope. It is well enough 
to point out that for any one man to frame 
thousands of questions, make hundreds upon 
hundreds of recommendations on any and 
every detail of a university's activities, deter- 
mining off-hand that a foreign language is 
unnecessary and so is military drill, that the 
president should not be a member of the gov- 
erning body, what students should pay for 
board, how faculty meetings shall be con- 
ducted and doctor's dissertations written, and 
so on endlessly, that all this is a colossal 
piece of impudence, which would indicate 
exactly the type of man you are dealing with. 
But the fact remains that when once the offi- 
cial inquiry takes this form, there is no ma- 
chinery available for stopping it, short of the 
threat of resignation of the entire Faculty, 
and who ever heard of professors acting col- 
lectively? The law provides; the money is 
spent ; and the report goes forth. 

It would be possible to introduce a vaccina- 
tion) campaign in any educational area in 
which the efficiency germ is likely to find a 
favorable culture-bed; the operation has a 
good chance of "taking" and conferring a 
temporary immunity. The only permanent 



448

protection is in the way of a wide-spread and 
deep appreciation of the needs of the educa- 
tional provisions for public welfare. How- 
ever spasmodic and uncertain our educational 
efforts, they have proved adequate to safe- 
guard cultural interests. The private institu- 
tions, with their capacities to mobilize their 
alumni reserves, are fairly safe from attack. 
The State institutions find their vulnerable 
point in the legislative plexus. The demo- 
cratic test is a peculiar one: it insists that 
every proposal must be capable of convincing 
a lay jury of its wisdom and necessity. The 
mentality of that jury is the critical issue; 
also the attitude in which it is encouraged or 
permitted to approach its authoritative dis- 
pensations. Political authority unquestion- 
ably includes the right to meddle with things 
imperfectly understood, and to override the 
judgments of those by attainment especially 
conversant with the delicate interests of the 
higher education. Whether that dubious privi- 
lege shall be exercised depends upon the 
practical conception of the purpose of the 
political instrument. The responsibility goes 
back to the universities themselves. They 
must decide whether they have remained true 
to their trust, or in a spirit of compromise 
have bartered their birthright for a mess of 
pottage; they must examine whether the con- 
ception of a university which they have de- 
fended has encouraged unwise interference, 
and provoked the use of the legislative blud- 
geon. For there the efficiency promoters and 
the energetic grinders of axes and the childish 
nursers of private grudges find sympathetic 
response. It comes with a sense of shock that 
such undesirable forces should be able to 
assert their powers and weaken, even under- 
mine, the foundations of our highest inter- 
ests. Possibly this ponderous monument of 
the folly and the danger of such a policy may 
lead the reflective to ponder. For the Allen 
mausoleum, in view of the transitoriness of 
mundane things, the epitaph is easy to select : 
"Verily this is rot." But as a constant re- 
minder of the watchfulness that is the price of 
educational safety a more stable and a more 
spiritual conscience and consciousness are 
indispensable. After every political cam- 
paign we learn that once more, and however 
the election turns, the country has been saved. 
The saving forces of the educational interests 
will rally to the charge. 



VEEBOTEN. 



It is Sunday. We are five at dinner, talking 
of the sinking of the "Lusitania," and our 
voices are subdued. One of us is a German, a 
teacher of German, an interpreter of Germany 
to America. Another is of German stock ; his 
ancestors had come to the United States after 
'48, leaving a brother dead in the fight for 
freedom. The third is a Jew, German-born 
and wont on occasion to tell us that he was 
made in Germany and improved in America. 
The fourth is pure American, of Puritan stock, 
the dean of our group. He is old enough to 
be the father of the oldest of us ; his choice of 
us as table-mates we regard as a great compli- 
ment. We defer to him in all our disputes, to 
his humor and to his experience. He is largely 
German-trained, a great lover of Germany, 
particularly of Gottingen, where he had stud- 
ied ; now and then he would tell us charming 
stories of his student-days. Of recent years it 
was his custom to return to Germany every 
summer. 

This day our talk has been less certain and 
less frank than is our custom. We have been 
skirting the edge of the topic, dwelling on the 
pity of it. We all exhibit strain, as in a house 
of mourning; silences, eloquent with tension, 
fall too often. At the end of one of these 
comes the voice of the Jew, low, but no longer 
hesitant, as if he has determined to cut through 
our reservations. 

"You know how I have always tried to 
explain, to explain away. But this time' 
when I read the paper I could n't believe it at 
first, and when I found I had to I felt a rush 
of anger, I wanted to crush that submarine- 
captain in my two hands, to break him in 
halves. At home I found my weekly ' Staats 
Zeitung.' The next thing I knew half of it 
was on the floor under my feet, the rest 
twisted to pieces in my hands. I was crying 
inwardly, God punish Germany ! " 

In the silence that followed we could hear 
the German's breathing. He opened his mouth 
once or twice, but did not say anything. He 
was very pale. Finally he burst out. 

"You, you! But what is the use? You 
do not understand, you cannot understand. 
I know what you all think, you, my friends. 
You have thought it from the beginning. 
Nothing that we may say or do will make you 
think otherwise, though we have pleaded and 
conceded and humbled ourselves for your 
American friendship, yes, even intrigued 
for it. But you also are in the league against 
us, the chief bulwark of our enemies. Here 
are you four all German-born or German- 
trained, yet I know from his silence that 



1915]

even Kurt here, who bears the name of an 
uncle who died for a free Germany in '48, 
even Kurt has condemned us. And Jacob, 
you heard what he said. He forgets what his 
own people are suffering at the hands of the 
Poles and the Russians. He forgets that it 
is also their battle we are fighting, quite as 
much as our own, the battle of civilization 
against barbarism. And he w r ants us crushed 
for a fair act of war! But, I ask you 
what could we do? "We are fighting for 
our national life, against overwhelming odds 
alone in the centre of an iron circle of ene- 
mies whose one grievance against us is that 
we are prosperous and civilized. We did not 
want war; we do not want war. We are the 
most peaceful people in Europe, hard-work- 
ing, studious, devoted to the ideal, to the bet- 
terment of mankind. Our one crime which 
you call militarism is self-defence. Only 
yesterday you took your ideals and standards 
from us, from our educational system, from 
our industries, from our arts, from everything. 
You sent your young men to study in our uni- 
versities and to learn our ways. You copied 
our scientists and philosophers. If you had 
been able, you would have copied our civic 
organization and social and economic methods. 
Your travellers and your scholars praised us by 
word and by pen. And now what has hap- 
pened? Have we changed over-night that you 
should call us Huns and barbarians and 
makers of war on women and children ? It is 
absurd ! We are the same as we always were ; 
the war has made no difference in us. We 
have broken no law. We have hurt none whom 
we could save. We have merely defended our- 
selves. You would allow a dog fighting for his 
life against a pack of wolves greater freedom 
than we have taken for ourselves." 

He rose and left us before we could stop him. 
After a pause the Jew said : " There is some- 
thing in that. Our turnover has been com- 
plete. I suppose because the contrast between 
the German at war and the German in peace 
is so violent that both can't be real." 

"Hold on," said the Yankee. "I am not 
sure that the violence of the contrast doesn't 
mean that both must be real." 

We looked our question. 

"Well, here is what I mean. You've both 
read Bedier's collection of citations from the 
diaries German soldiers are required to write 
his Crimes allemands ? I daresay your im- 
pression was the same as mine: the general 
mood of Bedier's evidence implied more than 
the mere execution of the ' orders of the day ' 
a willingness, a kind of joy, a gloating." 

"No, no," expostulated the German- Amer- 
ican. 



" Yes, Kurt, like a hungry man's when he's 
eating, or better, like a child's, free at last 
from the restraints of school." 

" I don't understand," said Kurt rather 
coldly. 

"I'm afraid not. Perhaps I don't under- 
stand, myself. But man and boy, I have 
known Germany for over forty years. I was 
one of the earliest of the Americans who went 
over there to study, and I have been there 
since repeatedly. I have seen the change of 
the old Germany into the new as it came. You 
might sum it all up by the word Verboten. 

" You see, the Germany I first knew was the 
Germany of your grandfather, Kurt, and it 
wasn't very different from the Germany of 
your great-grandfather, a pleasant, sleepy, 
dreamy country, rather messy, very indus- 
trious, very pious, sentimental, and most 
awfully wordy. People were not concerned 
about government, except when they made a 
holiday and the guard turned out. Whatever 
you called the form of government, there was 
a great deal of personal and social freedom. 
You went where you pleased, and did what 
you pleased; you didn't have to have pass- 
ports, nor get out of the way of the military. 
Life was easier than it was here, but essentially 
as democratic. You were certain, as, save for 
the wordiness, nowadays you can't be, of ex- 
actly what people meant when they called 
Germany a nation of poets and philosophers. 
Germans have always exhibited a curious as- 
surance that the Lord is with them, and that 
their will is His. It did n't particularly matter 
what they did, they always had a system of 
philosophy to prove that it was inevitable, that 
the Universe meant that and nothing else. 
Think of Kant with his obligatory moral law 
' within.' Think of Fichte with his metaphys- 
ical demonstration that the German people 
were intended by the Lord to be a cultured 
nation. What is the whole romantic movement 
but an eristical exhibition of how the uni- 
verse conspires with the romanticist's whim- 
sies? I remember reading an article by some 
American professor about the compensatory 
nature of ideas. I gathered that some sort of 
law operates which keeps men neutralizing un- 
pleasant facts with pleasant fancies, ideas 
in dreams, ideas in art and literature, ideas in 
philosophy. They sort of balance our accounts 
with the universe, our wishes taking notes on 
the unseen and the non-existent for the visible 
existing world's failure to pay. When roman- 
tic idealism flourished in Germany there were 
hundreds of small states and an infinite deal 
of local color. I suppose that the barren ex- 
panse and logical rigor of that way of think- 
ing, a way of thinking which makes all

things the same as your Absolute self, was a 
compensation for the pleasant grubbiness and 
provinciality and disorder of the actual daily 
life. It is all the same in the Absolute." 

" But what has all that to do with the war 
and Verboten and f rightfulness ? " interposed 
Kurt. 

" Why, this. So long as the Kantian ' moral 
law ' was ' within/ so long as the Absolute was 
an obligation in idea, it was a word, an ideal, 
and conspired with the individual to keep him 
free, expanding his imagination and saving 
him from provincialism. But thanks to Hegel, 
the word was made flesh and dwelt on earth ; 
the ideal became an idol." 

"To Hegel?" 

" Yes. Do n't you remember the peroration 
of his philosophy of history ? It describes the 
Prussian monarchy as Absolute Reason incar- 
nate, identifies it with the highest perfection 
which rational evolution, as history, could 
attain. Conservative, orthodox, wordy, and 
pro-Prussian, Hegel is the real master of 
Treitschke. Of all the consequences of his 
teachings and they are legion modern 
Germany is thus far the most efficacious. His 
way of thinking dominated Europe for two 
generations. It was the official philosophic 
orthodoxy of my student days, approved by 
the powers that be because it made them the 
Absolute's local habitation and name. It justi- 
fied things as they were. It rationalized 
acquiescence in Prussian aggression between 
'60 and '80, and made easy the complete Prus- 
sification of Germany in the '80s. There had 
been, for various reasons, an interval of over 
twenty years between my first and second jour- 
ney to Germany. I have since returned there 
every summer ; but the shock of that first re- 
turn repeats itself. The picturesque dirt and 
the jolly disorderliness were gone ; streets were 
clean and policemen plenty. The simplicity, 
the kindliness, and the democracy were gone ; 
the freedom of movement was gone, so was, 
really, the freedom of thought. The universi- 
ties and schools had been centralized; ad- 
vancement was dependent upon a ministry to 
whom your teaching must be satisfactory ; and 
if you were heterodox on any matter remotely 
connected with politics there was no hope for 
you. Everything else was like that, too, the 
press, commerce, the church. And the police- 
system, passports, surveillance, reports ! On 
all sides you were hemmed in with taboos, and 
if you expostulated you were met with an 
inexorable Verboten. All you could do was to 
swear in the privacy of your bedroom, to 
kick the cat, or to get drunk. Verboten was 
the moral law, the absolute reason, turned into 
a visible and audible fact. 



" The new generation which had grown up 
with it had grown up swearing, kicking the 
cat, getting drunk; the present generation is 
doing the same thing on the battlefield in a 
more exaggerated way, but the same thing. 
The new art, the new literature, the new 
eroticism and individualism, these are but the 
relief of swearing, the expression in idea of 
these traits which the Prussified social and 
political order repressed in fact. Transcen- 
dental Egotism has given way to personal 
selfishness, to bumptiousness, to vanity ; senti- 
ment and piety to subtle brutality toward 
women and to formalism in religion; social 
responsibility to intense individualism and 
rivalries, most marked, perhaps, in academic 
circles. Year by year, as I returned, I found 
these things intensified as the ' moral law ' 
became more 'objective' and Verboten more 
effective. Absolutism in fact had led to anar- 
chism in ideals: Germany was swearing and 
kicking the cat and getting drunk to beat the 
band. You know how the present generation 
swears by Nietzsche. And you know the 
Schrecklichkeit." 

"But," interposed Jacob, "isn't Nietzsche 
himself a cause of the Schrecklichkeit?" 

"Nonsense. Nietzsche was nothing if not 
an individualist. He had no use for the State. 
If young Germany has turned to him, it is by 
way of compensation. Like the atrocities, his 
hold on young Germany's imagination is an 
effect, not a cause. He supplies young Ger- 
many with what Mr. Robert Chambers sup- 
plies the shop-girl, a vicarious realization of 
repressed desire. The cause is the repression 
exercised by the ' moral law within ' turned 
into an outer fact. The cause is Verboten."

CASUAL COMMENT. 



FIFTY YEARS OF THE "FORTNIGHTLY," the 
review that professes by its name to appear 
every two weeks, and did so for a year at its 
start, but has ever since unblushingly belied 
its title by coming out monthly, have been 
rounded out with proper acclaim, and the 
publication starts on its second half-century 
under notably favorable auspices. It is not. 
by the way, the first English periodical of its 
sort to be guilty of a certain absurdity in the 
matter of title. There was, for instance, 
" The Prospective Review," called into being 
ten years earlier by James Martineau and 
others, and not unnaturally made the target 
for some good-natured jibes by reason of the 
contradiction in terms conspicuous in its 
name. As the jubilee of the review now con- 



1915]

ducted by Dr. Courtney is duly celebrated in 
the pages of that review, the reader is referred 
to those entertaining and instructive pages, 
to which it may be pertinent to add an appre- 
ciative word concerning its editor by a fellow- 
Oxonian. In his " Twenty Years of My Life " 
Mr. Douglas Sladen writes : " But of all the 
men who were at Oxford with me, no one has 
been so prominent, then and now taken to- 
gether, in intellectual circles as W. L. Court- 
ney. Courtney was then a rather young New 
College don, who had the distinction of being 
married to an extremely smart-looking wife. 
That would have been a distinction by itself 
in the Oxford of that day, for few were mar- 
ried in a way suitable to impress under- 
graduates. Added to that, he cut the most 
eminent figure in athletics of any don in 
Oxford. He was the treasurer of the Uni- 
versity Boat Club, while the dons respected 
him as the ablest man in Oxford at philoso- 
phy. . . His influence on literature has been 
immense. He has stood for the combination 
of scholarliness and up-to-dateness. His own 
books range from essays on the verge of fic- 
tion to some of the most important works on 
philosophy published in a generation. Inci- 
dentally, the creator of Egeria is our best 
dramatic critic, and a writer of plays." 
Noteworthy is the fact, vouched for by Mr. 
Courtney, that his review has gained rather 
than lost in circulation since the outbreak of 
the war and the consequent increased vogue 
of the daily newspaper. Repeatedly, he says, 
the "Fortnightly" has of late gone out of 
print on the fourth or fifth of the month; 
and a similar experience is reported by other 
London monthlies of like standing. Evi- 
dently the daily journalist's snap-shot views 
of current events do not suffice for all readers. 


LAXATIVE LITERATURE is both a cause and an 
effect of that general slackness and flabbiness 
that characterize, in varying measure, the im- 
perfect human nature of us all. This atonic 
quality in American literature and life re- 
ceives a sharp castigation at the hands of Mr. 
Owen Wister in an article entitled " Quack 
Novels and Democracy," which holds the place 
of honor in this month's "Atlantic." Espe- 
cially severe is he upon those present-day 
fiction-writers of whom he selects Mr. Harold 
Bell Wright as a typical example, upon the 
five million eager readers of such fiction, and 
upon that far more inclusive class of Amer- 
icans whom our Secretary of State is thought 
by Mr. Wister to represent. Slackness, heed- 
lessness, happy-go-lucky muddle-headedness, 
addiction to cheap sensationalism, a bland con- 
tent with sounding words and pretty phrases 



in place of disagreeable truths and stern reali- 
ties, and a general condition of self-complacent 
sloppiness these, or something like them, it 
appears, are conspicuous among our faults 
both as writers and readers and reviewers of 
novels, and as citizens of a supposedly self- 
governing State. The quack-novelist finds five 
million mouths watering for his " mess of mil- 
dewed pap," and the quack-statesman easily 
commands many more than five million elec- 
tive votes. Our people revel in sham, and 
assiduously cultivate a squint to avoid seeing 
the truth. Dr. Edward Garnett's notable deliv- 
erance of six months ago on American fiction 
is made the text for some remarks not exactly 
flattering to most of those who write, those 
who read, and those who review, our works of 
fiction. Timidity and lack of discrimination 
are charged against the literary reviews, of 
which the more respectable " stand ever ready 
to be the first to hail a perfectly ivell established 
artist." The view of Mr. Bryan upon which 
is premised so much of Mr. Wister's article 
seems to us quite unjust and unwarranted, as 
are also his sneers at the very few American 
periodicals (most of which he mentions by 
name) that have at least endeavored to main- 
tain discriminating standards in the appraisal 
of current fiction. Occasionally in his article, 
also, Mr. Wister proves that he is by no means 
an infallible critic himself, as in his aston- 
ishing remark about Mr. Galsworthy's " The 
Dark Flower." But, in the main, his whole- 
somely harsh utterances ought to be, and must 
be, in some degree, tonic and bracing and 
curative. ... 

TRAVESTY IN THE FORM OF FICTION is a legiti- 
mate variety of literary art, and is never liable 
to the severity of censure visited upon travesty 
that purports to be history or biography or 
travel or some other species of serious prose 
composition. Nevertheless, when the novelist 
puts forth a burlesque or a distortion in such 
wise as to cause it to be accepted seriously as 
something other than it is, he is guilty of a 
kind of disingenuousness, to say the least, that 
may stir just resentment. Such resentment 
has already been noted in these columns on the 
part of certain critical Irish readers of Canon 
Hannay's imaginative portrayals of life and 
character in his native Ireland ; and now there 
comes to notice, in the Dublin "Leader," an 
outspoken though not intemperate protest 
against the caricatures that this popular writer 
(known to his readers as " George A. Birming- 
ham ") has put his name to, more especially in 
some of his later books, as pictures of men and 
manners in the land of the shamrock and the 
shillelah. "Mr. Birmingham," complains the 



452 



THE DIAL 



[ June 10 



critic, " albeit guiltless of the coarse misrepre- 
sentations of the past, has contrived to revive 
the expiring tradition of the Irishman in cap 
and bells, with enough wit to entertain others 
and insufficient to discharge his own obliga- 
tions. At the very moment when, having 
almost overwhelmed this preposterous tradi- 
tion, writers and dramatists and poets were 
conspiring to replace it by the industrious 
and attractive circulation of the truth, there 
broke in upon their patriotic efforts Mr. Bir- 
mingham's company of comedians. Their 
appearance was doubtless agreeable to Mr. 
Birmingham's pocket, but it has been singu- 
larly misfortunate for his reputation and for 
the dignity of his country's literature." Re- 
gret is expressed for " the degradation of Mr. 
Birmingham's art by the conscienceless de- 
mands of the English fiction market," and the 
writer laments the "long descent from 'The 
Northern Iron ' to ' General John Regan,' and 
from so carefully written a book as ' The Seeth- 
ing Pot' to the pot-boiling comicalities of 
' Dr. Whitty.' " One can understand and can 
sympathize with a tendency to yield to the 
temptation to be highly entertaining and pro- 
portionately successful, commercially, rather 
than to be less entertaining and less success- 
ful; but the stern morality of the matter 
teaches that 'tis a writer's perdition to be 
popular when for the truth he ought to be 
unpopular. 

THE PERILS OP PLAYFULNESS, whether of the 
pen or of the tongue, lurk unsuspected on 
every hand. " Set a watch, Lord, before my 
mouth; keep the door of my lips," should be 
the humorist's constant prayer. Grown per- 
sons who jest in the presence of children do so 
at their own risk. The comptroller of stamps, 
at that historic party in Haydon's rooms, 
whose " phrenological development " Lamb so 
earnestly desired to inspect, will stand as the 
type of man before whom it is dangerous to be 
other than altogether serious. Carlyle, it will 
be recalled in this connection, had little relish 
for lighter humor of the Elian variety. To 
him Lamb's talk was "contemptibly small, 
indicating wondrous ignorance and shallow- 
ness," and there was " a most slender fibre of 
actual worth in that poor Charles." But be- 
tween Lamb and any Scotchman there never 
was much love lost. Not long ago there 
chanced to be printed in this department a 
paragraph ending with the phrase not in- 
tended to express an everlasting truth, but 
penned in lighter mood and, moreover, put 
into the mouth of a hypothetical man of let- 
ters "the pen is mightier than the plough." 
An esteemed contemporary (the hackneyed 



term is used here without sarcasm), from 
whom better things had been looked for, most 
unexpectedly and surprisingly pounced upon 
this little alliterative effort, censured with 
ponderous gravity the supercilious perpetrator 
of so wanton an injury against a worthy indus- 
try, magnanimously instructed him in his igno- 
rance that what he was dimly groping for in 
his comparison was the sword and not the 
plough, and delivered quite an improving lit- 
tle sermon on the usefulness and the dignity 
of agriculture. Not unnaturally, this stirred 
a desire to take candle in hand, as was done by 
Lamb on the occasion above mentioned, and, 
approaching the defender of the honest farmer, 
to accost him with the gentle humorist's polite 
request, " Sir, will you allow me to look at 
your phrenological development ? " 


A PLEA FOR THE REVIVAL OF A MORIBUND ART, 

the art of reading aloud, was not long ago 
persuasively made by Mr. Benjamin Ives Gil- 
man, Secretary of the Boston Museum of Fine 
Arts, before a gathering of Massachusetts 
librarians ; and his words have now achieved 
the permanence of print in the " Bulletin " 
of the Massachusetts Library Club. Mr. Gil- 
man suggests that a "docent service" be 
added to the public library's equipment, sim- 
ilar to the docent service inaugurated at the 
above-named museum eight years ago and 
since widely adopted in other museums both 
in this country and in England. Personal aid, 
free to all, in the appreciative study of its art 
works is furnished by the museum, greatly to 
the visitor's profit and pleasure; and it is 
argued that a similar docent service in the 
library, consisting chiefly of the viva voce 
interpretation of great authors in their noted 
books, would help to make those authors, now 
too much neglected, alive and real and full of 
meaning to the library-users. The details of 
the scheme would have to be worked out with 
thought and labor and the instruction of expe- 
rience. On this head Mr. Gilman says, among 
other things : " It would evidently not be ad- 
visable to add the duty to the burdens, already 
heavy, of the library force itself. Readers 
should in general be chosen from outside the 
staff as a regularly accredited corps of assis- 
tants. To read aloud well is not a talent given 
to many; and the choice of the corps would 
present difficulty. To those well fitted it 
would afford a new means, if not of livelihood, 
at least of adding to their earnings ; but great 
care would be needed to ensure that the reader 
should have a good voice, a pleasant delivery, 
and an intelligent and appreciative grasp of 
the particular work to be read." To his fur- 
ther pertinent remarks he might have added 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



453 



that this proposed decent service is but the 
logical extension of the already tried and ap- 
proved children's-story-hour service, though 
whether the addition is practicable or on the 
whole advisable still remains to be shown. 


THE BOOK-REVIEWER'S CHIEF FUNCTION is re- 
viewing books a useful platitude lost sight 
of by the would-be reviewer who writes essays 
or diatribes or sermons or rhetorical treatises 
or philosophical disquisitions in the guise of 
reviews. A faithful portrait of the book, as 
Mr. Eobert Lynd emphatically insists in a 
recent article on " Book-Reviewing " in " The 
British Review," is what is primarily de- 
manded of the reviewer, not his personal 
likings or dislikings as aroused by the author. 
But, like a good portrait of a person, this 
representation of a book's distinguishing quali- 
ties should be something more than an inven- 
tory of attributes, a table of measurements, a 
rogues'-gallery record of individual peculiari- 
ties; the vitalizing touch must make itself 
felt, the creative instinct should find play, 
even in so seemingly mechanical a task as 
reproducing in epitome the main features of 
a popular novel or a collection of essays or a 
work of history. This vitalizing touch can in 
many instances be attained by a discriminat- 
ing use of quotation and anecdote, by a suffi- 
cient admixture of the concrete example with 
the abstractions of literary criticism. But 
above all, as Mr. Lynd well urges, let the 
reviewer present the purpose or motive of the 
book, and indicate as clearly as possible how 
far that purpose has been attained. If the 
author's object is to justify matricide, no mere 
iteration, on the reviewer's part, of the sacred- 
ness of the maternal relation, will constitute a 
review of the book. In other words, a due 
measure of self-suppression is of superlative 
importance in book-reviewing, as in every 
other worthy form of human activity. 


THE PRIDE OF AUTHORSHIP shows itself un- 
abashed in some authors, tries ineffectually to 
conceal itself in others, makes the same at- 
tempt with better success in still others, and 
is entirely unknown to the remainder so 
few in number as to be virtually negligible. 
Probably no eminent author has ever dis- 
played with more delightful frankness this 
species of self-complacency, which after all 
need be no more than a certain legitimate and 
desirable measure of self-respect, than the 
amiable Autocrat of the Breakfast Table. A 
characteristic anecdote about him is told by 
Mr. Douglas Sladen in his " Twenty Years of 
My Life" (which is reviewed on another 
page), and it will be new to most readers. 



Contrasting Meredith's dislike to be made the 
object of gushing compliments with Dr. 
Holmes's smiling submission to the same in- 
fliction, Mr. Sladen tells of a lady whom he 
introduced to the affable American author, 
and who opened the interview thus: "It 
must bore you terribly, Dr. Holmes, to have 
everybody who is introduced to you telling 
you how they admire your books." " On the 
contrary," was the gallant reply, " I can never 
get enough of it. I am the vainest man alive." 
On the same occasion, the English chronicler 
adds, Dr. Holmes told him that he had been 
unable to do any literary work (except his 
"Hundred Days in Europe") for years, be- 
cause all his time was taken up with answer- 
ing complimentary letters. 



OBSTRUCTIVE LIBRARY LAWS are worse than 
none. The Illinois Library Extension Com- 
mission calls attention, incidentally, in its 
latest Report, to certain provisions of the 
public library law of this State that might 
advantageously be repealed or amended. For 
instance, under the existing law the largest 
unit that may levy a library tax is the town- 
ship ; but there are seventeen counties in 
Illinois that have no township organization, 
and that have no villages large enough and 
wealthy enough to maintain libraries, so that 
the inhabitants, outside the cities having pub- 
lic libraries, are dependent on the very inade- 
quate travelling library system for most of 
their reading matter. A county library law 
is needed, and is asked for; also a law, analo- 
gous to that governing the township high 
school, which would permit adjoining town- 
ships to unite for the support of a library. 
This would especially aid villages situated in 
parts of two townships and unable under pres- 
ent restrictions to maintain any sort of public 
library, whereas the combined resources of the 
two adjacent townships would suffice for the 
purpose. At the time of the issue of the 
Report hope was entertained that legislative 
action in the desired direction might soon be 

taken. 



A NEW DEPARTMENT OF STATE ARCHIVES is 

one of the by-products of militarism in Ger- 
many. With characteristic thoroughness the 
government has organized a " film corps " to 
procure cinematographic records of current 
military operations. Though some of these 
films will contribute to the edification of the 
masses, as represented by the frequenters of 
the moving-picture theatres, many will go to 
swell the " film archives," already numbering 
more than two thousand " reels." This graphic 
record of battles and other events and aspects 



THE DIAL 



[ June 10 



of the war is a thing wonderful in itself, how- 
ever fraught with lamentable significance, and 
points the way to future and worthier uses of 
the same method of preserving for all time 
(barring accidents) history in the process of 
making. Incidentally, the need will be em- 
phasized of fireproof buildings for archive 
purposes, unless some material indestructible 
by fire shall take the place of the present 
inflammable film. 



A CLASSIC AUTHOR IN HIS OWN LIFETIME, 

President Wilson has the gratification of 
seeing one of his carefully prepared and de- 
servedly admired speeches adopted for educa- 
tional use as a model of choice English in the 
public schools of Philadelphia. The address 
in question is the one he delivered on the 
tenth of May before an audience of newly 
naturalized citizens in New York. From the 
reported utterances of Philadelphia school- 
teachers it appears that this action on the 
part of Superintendent Jacobs has been heart- 
ily applauded. Cheerful acquiescence at the 
White House is to be taken for granted, since 
next to the writing of a nation's songs the 
privilege of contributing to its school reading- 
books must be held in high esteem ; and when 
the contributor also assists very conspicu- 
ously in making that nation's laws, what a 
piling up of honors do we behold ! 



COMMUNICATION. 

AN AGGRIEVED SHAKESPEAREAN 

COMMENTATOR. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a review of my book, " Some Textual Diffi- 
culties in Shakespeare," published in your issue of 
April 15 last, the writer repeatedly holds me up to 
scorn for referring to Nerissa as a " maid " in the 
sense of being a lady's-maid or household subordi- 
nate. If there is a reader of THE DIAL who does 
not know that this was Nerissa's position, let me 
suggest that before accepting the statements of 
this abusive review he refresh his memory by 
turning to some good commentator on Shakespeare 
or else by reading the play itself. The lines in 
question are as follows: 

" My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours; 
You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid." 

Shakespeare works by apposition mistress 
maid. Now if, as your critic claims, Nerissa is 
being referred to merely as an unmarried woman, 
and if she is not a household subordinate at all, 
then we have got to take the word applied to 
Portia in an apposite sense. We then have the 
lovely Portia being referred to as a " mistress " in 
that sense while she was as yet unmarried! 

As a matter of fact, your critic is so wholly 
engaged in finding fault with me, in four pages of 



vituperation, that he entirely fails to see the ridic- 
ulous straits into which his efforts are leading him. 
If he had any ability to read a line of Shakespeare 
this would have been impossible even though he 
had never read the play. 

He says there is " no excuse " for my taking 
Nerissa to be a " maid " in the sense that I do. 
Let us refer him to " Familiar Talks on Some of 
Shakespeare's Comedies " (Boston, 1897). "Nerissa 
is a lady-in-waiting but somewhat kitchen-minded." 
Or again : " Nerissa, her lady-in-waiting, is quick- 
witted, kindly, and deeply attached to the sweet 
heiress, but throughout we feel her inferiority of 
nature to be greater than her inferiority of posi- 
tion." Everybody knows that. 

True enough, Nerissa was a woman of quality, 
but this did not prevent her from serving in such 
a position to the rich nobleman's daughter. As to 
my "excuse" for calling the woman of quality a 
"maid," I must point out that it is Shakespeare 
who chose the word. Your critic is finding fault 
with Shakespeare. All his fine scorn must apply 
to the Bard of Avon and not to me. 

He is equally wroth that I should call Gratiano 
Bassanio's " man." He will not allow a nobleman 
to be so traduced. But look at the above lines, 
where Gratiano addresses Bassanio as " my lord." 
Your critic evidently thinks that these words refer 
to Bassanio merely as a nobleman, and that Grati- 
ano was equally a lord. Does he not know that 
Bassanio took Gratiano along and paid his ex- 
penses? In fact, it is necessary to the whole struc- 
ture of the play that these two lovers, Nerissa and 
Gratiano, should be subordinate to the mistress and 
master who were the principal lovers. Your critic 
not only does not understand the Shakespearean 
vocabulary but has no appreciation of the plot. 

Possibly, too, your readers would be interested 
in the following. The critic says, in summing up 
his view of one of my solutions : " It is a pity that 
our author has omitted to specify to an admiring 
world in what respect a bullet or leaden messenger 
of death is invulnerable and unconquerable." The 
chapter he refers to, which occupies but three 
pages, is wholly engaged in showing, in as plain 
English as I know how to use, that it is the air 
which is unconquerable, invulnerable. I would not 
think of making such a claim as he attributes to me. 
It would be ridiculous. Is not the following plain 
English : "And so ' still-peering air ' regards the 
atmosphere as always and ever the equal of these 
leaden missiles of war inconquerable, invulner- 
able " ? As I have said, the chapter dealing with 
this crux occupies but three pages, and it makes it 
plain that I am referring to the air as invulnerable, 
even though the above quoted sentence were not 
clear. Cannot your critic read the chapter he 
criticizes ? 

In dealing with one of my notes on " Hamlet," 
this critic says : " We challenge Mr. Stewart to 
name a single editor, critic, or commentator who 
gives the above paraphrase of the Captain's words." 
He is referring to my own interpretation or para- 
phrase. This is a peculiar remark to make about 
a book whose only object is to submit original inter- 
pretations. In other words, I write a book on those 
famous cruxes which have baffled commentators for 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



455 



nearly two centuries, and I submit solutions which 
I think will clear up the difficulty. All solutions 
in the past have failed to satisfy, therefore I take 
up the work. Necessarily, if I am to satisfy the 
minds of commentators, it must be with some new 
insight. It would be folly for me to submit any of 
the stock theories which have all proved futile. 
And submitting such a solution I am met with the 
challenge to show that any other commentator had 
ever submitted the same interpretation ! I should 
say not! It would be more in keeping for me to 
challenge Mr. Tannenbaum, the reviewer, to prove 
that anyone ever had. I do not understand the 
type of mind that feels called upon to write this 
sort of book reviews. This Mr. Tannenbaum, about 
whom I know nothing, " challenges " me. Why 
challenge me? It is a critic's function simply to 
review a book. 

Besides convicting me of " unwarranted cock- 
sureness " and " longwindedness " and "juvenility " 
and " contempt," and using almost every sort of 
sarcasm and opprobrious epithet that could be 
worked into a four-page review, he speaks of my 
" overloud thunderings in the index." As a matter 
of fact the little book has no foreword or preface 
or introduction of any kind. The index is simply 
two and one-half pages of alphabetically arranged 
reference to characters and subjects in the plays. 

The review is very misleading; and it is so full 
of error that I could hardly straighten it out in a 
reader's mind if I were to take twenty pages of 
THE DIAL. The best answer I can make to the 
critic's challenge is the following: The book bears 
the imprint of Yale and of Oxford, and is issued 
under the sponsorship of the Elizabethan Club of 
Yale. The Yale Press, of Yale University, gave 
the solutions three months of painstaking consid- 
eration. It was referred to Yale by the most 
eminent authority at Harvard which had not yet 
established its press. Previous to that, some of the 
solutions had been favorably commented upon by 
Shakespearean authority in New York. And not 
one of these do I know personally, nor have I ever 
met them. 

Your critic says, in accounting for my astound- 
ing presumption in explaining these cruxes, that 
I was probably led into it by " the ill-advised 
flattery of friends." As a matter of fact I have 
lived for eight years three and a half miles from 
even the smallest town on a lake in Wisconsin. I 
do not belong to a literary club nor have any 
literary associations; nor was I, during the time 
I was devoting to Shakespeare, in contact with 
anyone capable of advising me or offering me any 
encouragement. And all the letters I received from 
publishers in the east discouraged and advised 
against my attempting such a work. It was re- 
garded as impossible ; and a work that would pay 
no profit under any circumstances. I mention this 
as showing how greatly a critic like Mr. Tannen- 
baum can be mistaken in passing upon authors. 

As to my presumption in undertaking explana- 
tions in which all critics have failed. The first 
solution which I made in " Hamlet " has already 
changed the text of that play. I refer to Polonius's 
reply to the King in II., 2, 45. I changed the 
wording in that line, explaining the reason ; and 



Professor Neilson, of Harvard, whose "Cambridge " 
edition is recognized as the latest product of 
Shakespearean scholarship, asked my permission, 
through his publishers, to adopt my change in the 
line in " Hamlet." In rendering it as I do, and 
according to the First Folio, I am differing with 
every editor or commentator for two hundred 
years. But if my explanation at last makes the 
sense plain, and it is gladly adopted, am I to 
refuse to do such work simply because it is " pre- 
sumptuous " to differ with others? Such a work 
as this will never pay in money; and very slowly 
in fame. Criticism can neither hurt nor help the 
author. CHARLES D. STEWART. 

Madison, Wis., June 2, 1915. 

[After a careful perusal and consideration 
of Mr. Stewart's complaint about my review 
of his book, I can only say that I have nothing 
to retract from my criticism. He credits me, 
quite incorrectly, with the statement that 
Nerissa is termed a "maid" because she is 
unmarried. He continually speaks of Nerissa 
as a maid in the modern sense of the word 
because he opposes her to Gratiano as Bassa- 
nio's " man," that is, servant. My objection to 
Mr. Stewart's comments was not because he 
refers to Nerissa as a lady's maid but because 
he speaks of her as a servant. On p. 300 I 
pointed out that Gratiano's word "maid" is 
not the same as Mr. Stewart's. In the passage 
quoted by Mr. Stewart, "mistress" means a 
lady who rules or has control over a household, 
not one who employs servants; and "maid" 
means a lady-in-waiting, a maid of honor. 
Nerissa's service, like that of all maids of 
honor, was only technical. Gratiano's ad- 
dressing Bassanio as "my lord" no more 
proves he was the latter's "man" than Cas- 
sius's addressing Brutus so proves Cassius 
to have been an underling. Bassanio did not 
pay Gratiano's expenses, Mr. Stewart to the 
contrary notwithstanding. Moreover, Gra- 
tiano is not a nobleman, only a gentleman. 
Again, if the air is the equal of the leaden 
missiles of war in being unconquerable and 
invulnerable, I still want to know in what 
sense bullets are unconquerable and invulner- 
able. Finally, Mr. Stewart very indignantly 
maintains that I refer to one of his own inter- 
pretations of a passage in " Hamlet " as if it- 
were the interpretation of the commentators. 
This is perfectly characteristic of his method. 
As to that passage, this is what Mr. Stewart 
wrote : "According to the generally accepted 
interpretation, the Captain is supposed to be 
saying," etc. If his paraphrase is the gener- 
ally accepted one, it is not his, and I had a 
right to challenge him to name a single editor, 
critic, or commentator who so paraphrased the 
Captain. THE REVIEWER.]

THE DIAL 



[ June 10 



CROWDING MEMORIES or A TJITERARY 
LIFE.* 

As a magnet attracts iron-filings, so do some 
men acquire a multitude of interesting little 
experiences that come to them as naturally and 
abundantly as the filings to the magnet. Of 
such men, in the literary walks of life, is Mr. 
Douglas Sladen, prolific and versatile author 
of innumerable books, extensive traveller in 
all the continents and some of the islands of 
the globe, shrewd and humorous observer of 
men and manners, and everywhere and always, 
apparently, what in the expressive slang of 
to-day would be called " a good mixer." The 
persons of note whom he has not met and 
mingled with might almost be said to be not 
worth meeting, or such is the first impression 
received upon turning the very entertaining 
and, in no reprehensible sense, very personal 
pages of his omnium gatherum of reminis- 
cence and anecdote, " Twenty Years of My 
Life." With almost excessive restraint as an 
autobiographer, he limits the systematic re- 
hearsal of his own life to a few short chapters, 
and devotes the bulk of his book to other peo- 
ple's lives, or to some brief and characteristic 
snatches of them as they have come into juxta- 
position with his own. And yet he is frankly 
though inoffensively conscious of his own 
importance in the world wherein he moves, as 
appears in such passages as this from his open- 
ing chapter : "At Cheltenham I was the most 
prominent boy of my time, and the prestige 
with which I came up from school gave me a 
certain momentum at Oxford. So I went out 
to Australia with a very good opinion of Pub- 
lic Schools, of Oxford, and myself." 

His going to Australia was due largely to 
his father's having a brother there, Sir Charles 
Sladen, at one time prime minister of Victoria 
and afterward leader of the Upper House and 
of the Constitutional Party in that colony; 
and it was in the course of that early Austra- 
lian visit that Mr. Sladen obtained admission 
to the bar and was appointed professor of 
modern history at the University of Sydney, 
an appointment that came to him in conse- 
quence of his having received highest honors 
in history at Oxford a few years before. But 
one year in this academic chair was sufficient 
to convince him that it was not the seat exactly 
made to his measure. Though three volumes 
of verse had come from his pen and enjoyed 
as much local success as could have been;

Markino. New York : E. P. Dutton & Co. 



expected, he longed for the wider literary 
opportunities of his native London ; and so in 
1884, with the sanguine outlook proper to his 
twenty-eight years, he returned to England 
and began in earnest the pursuit of literature 
for a livelihood. Some idea of his educational 
equipment may be gained from his own words 
referring to that early time, words that make 
one envy the fulness and accuracy of his classi- 
cal and historical knowledge. He says : 

"As an author, I have found the education I 
was given and gave myself a very useful founda- 
tion. Those ten years I gave to the study of Latin 
and Greek and classical history and mythology 
were not thrown away, because I have written so 
many books about Italy and Sicily and Egypt, in 
which having the classics at my fingers' ends made 
me understand the history, and the allusions in the 
materials I had to digest." 

Omnivorous and rapid in his reading, he had 
been able at Cheltenham, according to his own 
account, to read " every book in the College 
library," besides being (with a generous use of 
capitals) " Senior Prefect, Editor of the school 
magazine, Captain of Football, and Captain of 
the Rifle Corps/' winner of " the prize for the 
English Poem" and many other prizes and 
four scholarships, and conspicuous in divers 
other respects that need not here be enumer- 
ated. With such a start in life, how could he 
have failed to attain eminence ? 

It is in the anecdotal pages devoted to other 
men that the author is at his best; and the 
temptation to quote freely from those divert- 
ing pages is irresistible. But their wealth of 
matter is such that the enjoyment of the book 
itself will suffer no appreciable diminution by 
reason of this plagiarism. Opening the vol- 
ume in the middle, here is what we find set 
down in commemoration of the late witty 
Henry Jeyes, journalist : 

" His reputation as a wit came up with him [to 
Oxford] from Uppingham. All Uppingham men 
could remember how, when he was caught cribbing 
with a Bible on his knee at a Greek Testament 
lesson, and his class-master had said to him tri- 
umphantly, ' What have you there, Jeyes?' he said, 
'A book, sir, of which no man need be ashamed,' 
and how when Thring, the greatest head master of 
his time, had asked him how he came to be ploughed 
in arithmetic for his Oxford and Cambridge cer- 
tificate, he replied from Shakespeare, 'I cannot 
reckon, it befits the spirit of a tapster ' a readi- 
ness which Thring would have been the first to 
appreciate. 

"Among the best things I remember him saying 
at Oxford are [sic] his definition of the Turks in 
a great debate over the Bulgarian atrocities, as a 
people ' whose morals are as loose as their trousers, 
and whose vices are as many as their wives.' And 
it was he who said, ' I don't want to go to Heaven, 
because Gore (now Bishop of Oxford) is the only

Trinity man who will be there, and I'd rather be 
with the rest.' " 

In another chapter occurs a passage giving 
the origin of a noted saying that has even more 
significance now than when it was uttered; 
and the paragraph is interesting for other rea- 
sons also. Speaking of Mrs. Margaret Woods, 
he writes : 

" She was one of the few charming women that 
the monastic Oxford of that day contained. Her 
father, afterwards the famous Dean of West- 
minster, was master of University College; I used 
to go to his Socrates lectures. He was dissatisfied 
with the progress we were making, and boldly it 
was very bold at Oxford charged us with paying 
too much attention to athletics, and it was then 
that he made his famous mot, that he had never 
taken any exercise in his life, except by occasionally 
standing up when he was reading. I have heard 
that it was equally true of Mr. Chamberlain, but it 
was Dean Bradley who said it. The Bradleys were 
an excessively clever family. The Dean had a 
brother or a half-brother a great philosopher, a 
don at Merton, and another, Andrew Bradley, a 
Fellow at Balliol, who became Professor of Litera- 
ture at another University. I forget what his 
sister, Emma Bradley, did, but she was famous. 
Three of his daughters, Mrs. Woods, Mrs. Birch- 
enough, Mrs. Murray Smith, are authoresses, Mrs. 
Woods being one of the best novelists of the day, 
and in my opinion the best of all poetesses in the 
English language. When Tennyson died there was 
a movement in favour of her being made the lau- 
reate, and no woman has ever had such claims for 
the post." 

Curiously interesting and rather character- 
istic of puzzling human nature is the fact that 
Mr. Sladen, with so many other books of far 
greater literary worth to his credit, seems to 
take especial pride in his editorship of the 
first "Who's Who" in its present form 
there had been an annual of that name in 
existence for half a century before he recog- 
nized, in 1897, the splendid possibilities in its 
peculiar title. So great is his satisfaction in 
this product of his editorial industry that he 
calls himself, on the title-page to his present 
book, " author of ' Who's Who/ " and nothing 
more. In fact, he devotes a special chapter to 
the history of " How I Wrote ' Who's Who/ " 
Among the interesting things he tells us about 
the planning of the work we quote the fol- 
lowing : 

" The idea of adding ' recreations ' to the more 
serious items which had been included in previous 
biographical dictionaries was adopted at one of 
the councils of war which we used to hold in the 
partners' room of A. & C. Black, at 4 Soho Square. 
And for selling purposes it proved far and away 
the best idea in the whole book, when it was pub- 
lished. The newspapers were never tired of quot- 
ing the recreations of eminent people, thus giving 
the book a succession of advertisements of its 



readability, and shopkeepers who catered for their 
various sports bought the book to get addresses of 
the eminent people, who were, many of them, very 
indignant at the Niagara of circulars which re- 
sulted." 

Of that sincerest form of flattery which the 
work has received in its many imitations in 
different countries, including notably our own, 
the complacent author rather strangely omits 
to make mention; but he calls attention to 
some of the useful features that marked the 
English "Who's Who" in his day, and that 
have since disappeared or suffered neglect, 
" such as lists of peculiarly pronounced proper 
names, keys to the pseudonyms of prominent 
people, names of the editors of the principal 
papers." He adds : " Some of the real names 
were so unreasonable that people wrote to 
know why they were not included in the lists 
of pseudonyms; one of these was Sir Louis 
Forget." 

In his various wanderings Mr. Sladen has, 
of course, visited this country more than once ; 
in fact, he has spent months at a time in Amer- 
ica, and he knows our celebrities nearly as well 
as those of his own land. From his memories 
of our distinguished men we select a passage 
concerning one of the most famous : 

" Bret Harte, though he was such a typically 
American writer, spent all the latter part of his 
life in England. I first met him at Rudolph Leh- 
mann's hospitable dinner-table. No one could fail 
to be struck with Bret Harte. He was so alert, so 
handsome, and though his plumes his hair was 
thick and sleek to the day he died were of an 
exquisite snow-white, he had a healthy, fresh-col- 
oured face, and a slender, youthful figure, always- 
dressed like a well-off young man. . . He re- 
tained his vogue to the end. Any magazine would 
pay him at the rate of a couple of pounds for 
every hundred words. They used to say that the 
Bank of England would accept his manuscripts as 
banknotes. He never failed to charm, whether he 
was telling some story at a dinner-party, or talking- 
to some undistinguished woman, young and beau- 
tiful or old and plain, who had asked to be intro- 
duced to him as a celebrity and a celebrity 
Francis Bret Harte certainly was, for he founded a 
whole school in English literature." 

Very naturally and pardonably, a writer 
making such draughts on his memory as Mr. 
Sladen, and writing so rapidly and copiously, 
commits minor errors of forgetfulness or of 
insufficient information. For instance, in the 
present volume, he makes John Hay " Harri- 
son's Secretary of State," and, confusing two 
of our public men, of unequal prominence, he 
refers to "the beautiful Viva Sherman, an 
American nearly related to the Senator- Vice- 
President." Less excusably, he speaks of 
Edward FitzGerald as "unable to translate 
from the original " of Omar Khayyam, though 



458

FitzGerald's published letters contain fre- 
quent mention of his Persian studies under 
Professor Cowell's encouragement, and he 
made some notable translations (not always 
literal, it is true) from Jami and Attar as well 
as from Omar. 

The illustrations to the book, by the Japa- 
nese artist, Mr. Yoshio Markino, deserve more 
than perfunctory mention. Both his exquisite 
colored drawings and his oddly effective por- 
trait sketches are masterpieces in their pecu- 
liar kind, and would suffice by themselves to 
give character to the volume. Character, how- 
ever, seems not to be lacking to its author, 
whose rambling but never tedious chapters 
will furnish more entertainment to the great 
public of " general " readers than almost any 
other book of the season. 

PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



JUSTICE FOR THE INDIAX.* 

Mr. Moorehead is a well known student of 
American archaeology, and most of his writings 
have been in that field. To his efforts is due 
the only department of American archaeology 
in a preparatory school in the United States 
that of Phillips Academy, Andover. He has 
also for years been an active member of the 
United States Board of Indian Commissioners, 
and in that capacity has visited many of the 
Indian reservations and has participated in 
investigations of conditions in them. The 
present book is a result of this latter activity. 
The author calls it " a plea for justice," and 
every reader will recognize the earnestness of 
the pleader and the urgency of his cause. 
Thousands of Americans have been stirred by 
the reading of Helen Hunt Jackson's "Century 
of Dishonor," that powerful appeal to con- 
science; most of those thousands have ex- 
pressed regret and horror at the story, and 
have then gone their way placidly, feeling that 
there was no remedy for the matter, that the 
damage was irretrievable, that all was past and 
what was done could not be undone. But the 
fact is that wrongs against the Indians have 
continued and still continue, and the well- 
meaning thousands are as unconscious of them 
as they are of the happenings on Mars, less 
conscious of them than they are of atrocities 
in Armenia or Russia. These same people 
shuddered over highly colored reports of 
Congo horrors, and contributed their dollars 
to aid "reforms" there, but were oblivious to 
the facts at White Earth Agency and in Okla- 
homa. Yet there is nothing in Helen Hunt 

* THE AMERICAN INDIAN IN THE UNITED STATES, 1850-1914. 
By Warren K. Moorehead, A.M. Illustrated. Andover, Mass. : 
The Andover Press. 



Jackson's book worse than these nothing in 
Armenia, Russia, or Congo that is more brutal 
and cruel. Mr. Moorehead has not the pen of 
Mrs. Jackson, nor her sense of art and style; 
but his plea for justice is as real, and his facts, 
many of them personally gathered at their 
source, are convincing. 

Such things as he narrates are to be expected 
at the fringe of civilization. Men separated 
from home and all restraints, men living as 
traders or administrators under trying condi- 
tions of climate and life, men whose daily life 
is in a sense piracy or exploitation of a differ- 
ing people, men whose nights are filled with 
dangers from savage foes, such men will at 
times deal unjustly with natives. But Minne- 
sota and Oklahoma of to-day are not the fringe 
of civilization. The men who there sin against 
justice and decency are not outcasts, isolated 
and removed from proper influences. They are 
American citizens; they are men in business 
and professional life, lawyers, real-estate 
dealers, county officials, bankers, capitalists, 
legislators; they not only know how to read 
and write, they are respected, they attend 
churches, they mould opinion, they are leaders 
in their communities. Yet, for the sake of 
money, they are blind to law. commit crimes, 
debauch and degrade their victims that they 
may plunder and rob. It is a story so inde- 
scribably sad that it seems almost unbelievable. 
Nothing more clearly show's the breakdown of 
our educational system, the failure of our 
schools to develop moral fibre and to produce 
men, than White Earth and Oklahoma. Can 
we really see nothing but the dollar? Are we 
without heart and conscience? Have we no 
sense of decency, and is individual honesty 
forever gone ? The dreadfulness of the case is 
not merely that there are thousands among us 
who do such crimes, it is that they do them 
without general reprobation and execration. 
They are culpable; but the community that 
can be in ignorance, or being informed can 
hold its peace, is equally to blame. We have 
spoken of White Earth and Oklahoma because 
they are striking cases, which have been con- 
spicuous on account of investigations; but 
they are only special instances among many. 
Injustice is the rule, and in every place where 
we have Indians, Mr. Moorehead gives details 
covering a wide field. He points out mistakes 
past and present, and warns us of the future. 
We are threatened as a nation with a more 
serious Indian problem than we have ever had. 
The Indian to-day is being individualized and, 
in the process, depraved and pauperized. He 
has never been a pauper and a public charge ; 
he is sure to become so unless he is given jus- 
tice. He is to-day impoverished, diseased, 



1915] 



THE DIAL 



459 



degraded. It is a suggestive fact that the 
Navajo are to-day the only considerable body 
of true Indians remaining who are in fair 
health and prosperity and with good outlook 

if left alone. They are practically the only 
ones who have been left to follow their own 
free and natural life. 

All writers draw a contrast between the 
situation of Indians in the United States and 
those in Canada. In what are they different ? 
That there is a difference proves that contact 
between two races does not inexorably lead to 
such a condition as we have. Has the Cana- 
dian white man higher ideals than we ? Is he 
more honest, more just ? Or is it a mere ques- 
tion of dollars, and is he less hungry for gold 
than we? In speaking of Canadian policies 
regarding Indians, Mr. Moorehead says: 

" Mr. Duncan C. Scott, who holds the office in 
Canada corresponding to our Commissioner of 
Indian Affairs . . showed us a few thin pamphlets 

all the regulations, laws, statements, methods of 
procedure, etc., necessary in the management of 
Canadian Indian affairs. With us we employ 
skilled lawyers to fathom the intent of our legisla- 
tors. They must delve into thousands of pages of 
conflicting laws, rules and statutes. And after one 
set of attorneys have presented their views, the 
mass of legal rulings is so enormous and compli- 
cated that other attorneys assigned the same task 
usually arrive at exactly opposite conclusions from 
those presented by the first corps! Mr. Scott also 
informed us that when a white man marries an 
Indian woman in Canada, he has no part in tribal 
or individual property. The government issues no 
deeds to Indians, but they live on their farms as do 
our own. All incentive to graft is removed. The 
simple, effective, Canadian management of Indian 
affairs, compared with our ponderous, complicated 
and ignorant handling of the same class of people 
in this country, points a very strong moral." 

As a people we claim to excel in honesty and 
in practical business sense. The condition of 
our Indians to-day gives the lie to both claims. 

FREDERICK STARR. 



TAGORE: POET A*TD MYSTIC.* 



The award of the Nobel Prize for " idealistic 
literature " to Rabindranath Tagore suddenly 
made him an international figure. At that 
time his work was scarcely known, except to a 
limited circle; the award was due, according 
to Mr. Ernest Rhys, to " a distinguished Swe- 
dish Orientalist who had read the poems in 
Bengali before they appeared in English."

Mabie. New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 

SONGS OF KABIR. Translated by Rabindranath Tagore. With 
Introduction by Evelyn Underbill. New York : The Macmil- 
lan Co. 



Tagore has since translated a number of his 
representative books into English, in which 
the finer harmony of prose has been rendered 
with a sensitiveness and refinement rare in our 
Western literature. But as a man he has 
remained shadowy to us. And inasmuch as 
circumstances have made him in some sort an 
ambassador of the East to the West, we have 
come to desire a larger body of biographical 
fact concerning him, as well as an account of 
his place in the traditions of his own land. 

To fill this need we now have two biogra- 
phies: one by Mr. Ernest Rhys, a friend of 
the poet, and temperamentally fitted to appre- 
ciate him ; the other by Mr. Basanta Koomar 
Roy, a fellow countryman who is endeavoring 
to make his native land better understood in 
America. Both biographers have gathered 
their information at first hand, and so have 
made their books authoritative ; but Mr. Rhys, 
partly because of his style and partly because 
of his merely appreciative and interpretative 
role, has given no very definite outline to the 
character of the poet and mystic. Mr. Roy has 
been more conscious of the difficulties in inter- 
preting the East to the West, and has main- 
tained a more critical poise throughout his 
book. 

The impression we derive from Mr. Roy's 
volume is of a personality of rich charm and 
great activity. Tagore's varied career as man- 
ager of his father's country estate, as poet, 
musician, essayist, dramatist, novelist, editor, 
national leader, and finally as educator, seems 
to us too prolific and energetic to be truly 
Oriental. Moreover, quotations from his let- 
ters prove him a keen observer and thinker, 
with decided opinions on such dangerous sub- 
jects as feminism, education, and the defects 
of Americans. " Tagore is a voracious reader. 
Every month he buys many books on litera- 
ture, philosophy, economics, politics, sociology, 
and history. He reads them all." He is not 
ascetic or soured. " He loves the world as 
passionately as a miser loves money." It is 
reassuring to the Western mind to find a spir- 
itual hero so human, a seer so practical and 
near. 

To rehearse the main incidents in the quiet 
life of Tagore is not necessary; they have 
been known since the publication of "Gitan- 
jali" with Mr. Yeats's introduction. But in 
the full account of the poet's career given in 
Mr. Roy's book, it is interesting to look for 
important points of contact with the romanti- 
cism of Europe. Thus we read : 

" The realistic love poems of Tagore's youth 
shocked many old-fashioned Hindu moralists, who 
received them with disdain. They were up in arms 
against Rabindranath, thinking that he was likely 



460 



THE DIAL 



[June 10 



to demoralize the youths of India by the sensuous- 
ness of his love poems and songs. They were 
afraid that he was going to introduce the romanti- 
cism of the West, of Byron and Shelley, in India, 
and to depart from the classic serenity of Indian 
literary treatment of the human passions." 

In his love of nature, also, he wins at once 
the sympathy of those who have been nour- 
ished on Wordsworth. How near he ap- 
proaches the nature worship of European 
romanticists may be seen from a letter written 
in his youth from a house-boat on the Padma 
River, where he was superintending his fath- 
er's estate: 

" Truly, I love this Padma River very dearly, it 
is so wild, so undomesticated. I feel like riding on 
its back and patting it caressingly on its neck. . . 
I no more like to take a part before the footlights 
of the stage of publicity. I rather feel like doing 
my duty in silent solitude amid these transparent 
days that we have here. . . Here man is insignifi- 
cant, but nature great and imposing. The things 
we see around us are of such a nature that one can- 
not create to-day, mend to-morrow and throw them 
off the day after. These things stand permanent, 
amidst birth and death, action and inaction, change 
and changelessness. When I come to the country- 
side I do not look upon man as anything separate" 
from nature. Just as rivers flow by through many 
strange lands, similarly the current of humanity, 
too, is incessantly following its zig-zag path 
through dense forests, lonely meadows, and 
crowded cities, always accompanied by its divine 
music. It is not quite right to make the river sing, 
1 Man may come, man may go, but I go on forever ' 
for man, too, is going on forever with his thou- 
sand branches and tributaries. He has his one end 
attached to the root of birth, and the other to the 
ocean of death both enveloped in the mysterious 
darkness; and between these two extremes lie life, 
labour and love." 

Such evidences of parallel movements of 
romanticism in the East and the West seem 
even more conclusive when we read that 
" Raja Ram Mohun Roy, the father of modern 
India, introduced an age of reform in India. 
Well versed in the literature of the East and 
of the West, he strove to unite the cultural life 
of both for mutual benefit. With his towering 
genius he handled the social, political, relig- 
ious, and literary life with the hand of a 
master. . . At his death, he left a unique 
worker as his intellectual descendant, De-ben- 
dranath Tagore, the father of Rabindranath." 
Frequently Rabindranath Tagore is praised 
for uniting the wisdom of the East and the 
West, and so being able to see the defects of 
both. One begins to wonder if the whole 
national renaissance of India was due to 
European stimulus. 

But the Hindus see that materialism and 
luxury are dominant in our civilization, and 
by their clear vision are defended against our 



influence. " I am afraid," wrote Tagore, 
"that the present-day civilization of Europe 
is imperceptibly extending the arid zone in its 
' social life. The super-abundance of luxuries 
is smothering the soul of the home home 
that is the very abode of love, tenderness, and 
beneficence a thing that is, above all, most 
essential for the healthy development of the 
human heart. In Europe homes are disap- 
pearing and hotels are increasing in number." 
In a letter he once wrote that " as the streets 
in the European cities are made of hard stone, 
brick and mortar, to be made fit for commerce 
and transportation, so the human heart be- 
comes hardened and best suited for business. 
In the hard pavement of their heart there is 
not the slightest opening for a tender tendril, 
or a single blade of useless grass to grow. 
Everything is made bare and strong." 

Contact with European civilization has, of 
course, had a liberating influence on Tagore. 
But his true antecedents are members of the 
great poetical and religious tradition of India. 
In his poetry of nature he was deeply influ- 
enced by the Vaishnava poets of the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries, " even though," says 
Mr. Roy, "in the poems of Tagore the love 
fervour of the Vaishnava poets fades a little." 
In his devotional and religious poetry he was 
profoundly influenced by Kabir, Chandidas, 
and Joy Dev. In the translations which he 
himself has given us of the songs of Kabir, the 
fifteenth century mystic and poet, we find the 
same religious universalism, the same accep- 
tance of actual life, as in the work of Tagore. 
Kabir was a Mohammedan youth who was 
admitted to discipleship by the great Hindu 
teacher Ramananda, even though a Mohamme- 
dan, a weaver, a simple and unlettered man. 
"Hating mere bodily austerities, he was no 
ascetic, but a married man, the father of a 
family a circumstance which Hindu legends 
of the monastic type vainly attempt to conceal 
or explain and it was from out of the heart 
of the common life that he sang his rapturous 
lyrics of divine love." This disregard for the 
letter of the law, however, is not popular in 
India, and the religious songs of Tagore are 
not the songs of the masses. " The masses 
have no comprehension of the Brahmo Somaj 
the religious Unitarians of Hindusthan. . . 
One might sing Tagore's religious songs to a 
Bengali farmer, but he would listen unmoved ; 
and might even ask the singer to stop if he 
happened to detect it to be a Brahmo song. 
The orthodox hatred for Brahmo disregard for 
Hindu mythology is very intense." 

It is interesting to note from Mr. Roy's book 
that admiration for Tagore is much more criti- 
cal and reserved in India than in England and

America. His countrymen admit his great- 
ness, but not that he is the greatest Bengali 
poet for many centuries, as is sometimes 
nastily said. One literary Bengali in America 
commented : " If Mr. Tagore had ever at- 
tempted to write profound books like ' Raiba- 
tak ' or ' Kurukshetra ' of Nabin Chandra Sen, 
his lyric brain would have burst before finish- 
ing even one canto of either." Another said : 
" His love lyrics are poor imitations of the 
poems of our Vaishnava poets of old, and his 
philosophy is the philosophy of the Upani- 
shads. Let the Europeans and the Americans 
rave over Tagore. But there is nothing new 
for us in his writings." Tagore himself pleads 
guilty to dabbling with too many things: 
" I am like a coquettish lady that wants to 
please all her lovers, and is afraid to lose a 
single one. I do not want to disappoint any 
of the Muses." Nevertheless "no other lit- 
erary man in Bengal has done so well in so 
many things. Even the most adverse critics 
of Tagore are bound to admit that he has 
adorned every department of Bengali litera- 
ture by his transcendent genius." .Pie has 
become a representative, especially in poetry, 
of the Bengali renaissance which is saving the 
classical culture of India. " He was needed in 
India as Dante was needed in Italy, Shakes- 
peare in England, and Goethe in Germany." 
In seeking to define and estimate the signifi- 
cance of Tagore for the West, it is interesting 
to recall that poetry had been drifting in the 
direction of mysticism before Tagore became 
known to us. " These lyrics," wrote Mr. 
Yeats in his preface to " Gitanjali," " display 
in their thought a world I have dreamed of all 
my life long." Poetry had sought to become 
a symbol, a musical suggestion. And so we 
were prepared to understand an art which 
proceeds, not by definition and outline, after 
the Greek manner, but by suggestion and sym- 
bolism. But it is out of the question that the 
main body of our poetry and art should ever 
become merely suggestive and mystical; the 
hold of the Greek spirit on us is too great; 
Phidias and Plato make us afraid of intellec- 
tual twilight, of emotional dissipation. In one 
respect, however, the literature and life of the 
Orient are a deep challenge to our civilization. 
" If I work in my garden and prune an apple- 
tree," wrote Emerson, " I am well enough 
entertained, and could continue indefinitely in 
the like occupation. But it comes to mind that 
a day is gone, and I have got this precious 
nothing done." It is characteristic of our 
civilization, however, that we continue the 
activity without reflecting upon its vacuity. 
"We are not happy unless active. Hindu 
poetry should reveal to us that the lack of a 



core of thought accounts for the fatuity of our 
religious efforts, the charlatanism in our cul- 
ture, the restlessness and materialism of our 
life. "You people over here," Tagore once 
remarked to Mr. Rhys, " seem to me to be all 
in a state of continual stj^fe. It is all strug- 
gling, hard striving to live. There is no place 
for rest, or peace of mind, or that meditative 
relief which in our country we feel to be 
needed for the health of our spirits." When- 
the Nobel Prize was awarded to him, he gave 
all the money to his remarkable school at 
Shanti Niketan; but, overwhelmed by pub- 
licity, he wrote, " They have taken away my 
shelter." Louis I. BREDVOLD. 



A SCIENTIFIC BAEDEKER or THE WEST.* 

A telling example of the effectiveness of 
cooperative effort in book-making is given in 
the volume entitled "Nature and Science on 
the Pacific Coast," a well-balanced treatise by 
no less than thirty authors, each an authority 
on the subject about which he has written. 
This handbook is planned for use in conjunc- 
tion with the meetings of the American Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Science to be 
held in August of this year in connection with 
the Panama-Pacific International Exposition. 
The volume will, however, be of value long 
after the palaces by the Golden Gate have van- 
ished into memories, for it is an epitome of the 
enduring natural phenomena of the West. 

Though professedly written for the scien- 
tific traveller, it is not a technical treatise 
for specialists, but rather a presentation by 
specialists, each of his own field, for the use 
and enjoyment of all the others. It is there- 
fore largely freed of technicalities wherever 
possible, and condensed to a minimum space. 
Would that all books of information were as 
innocent of superfluous padding ! It is rather 
a rich mine of information tersely told, with- 
out effort to adorn or to exploit the resources 
of this interesting land for the tourist or the 
prospective purchaser of town lot or orchard. 
It seeks merely to direct the attention of the 
intelligent traveller to those physical features 
of the Coast which it may be worth his while 
to understand. 

The range of information included in the 
thirty-one chapters may be inferred from such 
sub-titles as Professor Kellogg's "Burbank's

RECENT FICTION.* 



Miss Marie Van Vorst is an accomplished 
story-teller, and her large personal following 
attests the success with which she appeals to 
the popular taste. " Mary Moreland " is per- 
haps the best example of her work, and it is 
easy to see why it must prove attractive to 
readers and hold their attention. Mary is a 
young woman of exceptional poise and 
strength of character, employed as a stenog- 
rapher by a Wall Street financier. For five 
years she has served him, and during all that 
time he has been making more or less conscious 
comparisons between her and the nagging, 
jealous, worldly w r oman who is his wife. When 
domestic ructions have brought him to the 
breaking-point, he determines to cut loose, and 
appeals to Mary to go off with him. She 
almost yields, but is recalled to her better self 
at the last moment, and declines to enter into 
the illicit arrangement. She is torn by the 
conflict between love for her employer and the 
promptings of a conscience which will not let 
her forget the sanctity of the marriage-bond, 
and the social necessity of preserving even 
such parodies of the home as Maughm's estab- 
lishment. She not only succeeds in resisting 
temptation, but she actually figures as a recon- 
ciling influence between Maughm and his wife. 
In the end, she comes to her own in conse- 
quence of the wife's death in childbirth. A 
secondary plot is provided by the fortunes of 
a girl friend who has loved not wisely but too 
well, and who is saved by Mary's influence 
from making a still greater mess of her life. 
The remaining characters of importance are 
Romney, an invalid English man of letters 
whom she serves for a time as amanuensis; a 
Colorado mine-owner who takes her into the 
bosom of his family, and her mother, an in- 
credibly vain, selfish, irresponsible woman 
with a tincture of nauseating religiosity, 
whom Mary supports and almost loves despite 
her sordid scheming and inhuman ingratitude. 
All these characters are interesting, yet we 
feel bound to .say that not one of them appears 
to be a consistent creation. The facets which 
reflect them to us are separately brilliant, but 
are cut according to a plan which does not 
bring out a symmetrical design. This lack of 
artistic co-ordination is also apparent in the

dialogue and the incidental matter, which 
present us over and over again with features 
which do not fit together, or are without 
adequate motivation. This element of incon- 
gruity is felt as a disturbing presence through- 
out the work. 

The American business woman is again to 
the fore in Mr. Samuel Merwin's " The Honey 
Bee," but this time she is presented to us in a 
far more profound and subtle portraiture than 
is within the range of Miss Van Vorst's powers. 
Mr. Merwin's previous performances in fiction 
have, indeed, given us no reason to expect from 
him so profound a psychological study and so 
genuine a creation of character as he here 
affords us. There is no romantic glamour in 
"The Honey Bee," and little sentiment, but 
there is a great deal of convincing truth, which 
is a much more preservative quality. Hilda 
Wilson, to begin with, is upwards of thirty, an 
age which does not appeal to the romantic 
taste, although it is the age found best worth 
while by many of the greatest novelists, from 
Balzac to Meredith. She is a department man- 
ager in one of the great New York merchant 
establishments, and she has made good in her 
many years of service. A part of each year 
she acts as a foreign buyer, and it is in Paris 
that we make her acquaintance, and pursue 
her fortunes during the year over which the 
time of the novel extends. Somewhat fagged, 
and feeling that she is going stale, she accedes 
to her employers' solicitations that she take a 
long rest, but, instead of employing her 
months of business leisure in a restful way, 
she remains in Paris, and falls into a set of 
new associations and interests that take her 
far out of her wonted habits of thought and 
action, stir in her unsuspected instincts and 
emotions, and give her rich new experiences 
that broaden her character, and bring her to 
Something of that self-realization which is, or 
should be, the purpose of every human soul 
worth saving to achieve. These experiences 
concern a little group of people with whom 
Hilda becomes accidentally associated, and 
from whom she learns to know aspects of life 
that have before been entirely unfamiliar. 
They include "Blink" Moran, an American 
prize-fighter; Adele Rainey, a variety-show 
dancer ; a weak and vicious youth who is her 
dancing partner; and the illegitimate baby 
child of a French danseuse, who is herself in 
the hospital. Hilda moves into quarters with 
these people, takes Adele under her protection 
and the baby under her care incidentally 
saving the life of the latter by hygienic pre- 
cautions and scientific feeding and becoming 
personally very much interested in Moran. 
The author portrays Moran so sympathetically 



that we respect him (as Hilda does) despite 
his profession, and the scene of the great fight 
for the international championship is de- 
scribed with so much vigor and dramatic color- 
ing that it is one of the best things of its kind 
we have ever encountered in fiction. Hilda is 
even stirred to think of Moran as a possible 
husband, and the author's skill almost per- 
suades us that we might contemplate without 
dismay such a disposition of his heroine ; but 
Hilda's practical good sense comes to her 
rescue, and sets her to making a match be- 
tween Moran and Adele, which is far more 
fitting and reasonable. What contributes 
materially to Hilda's decision is the memory 
of Harris Doreyn, a man of large affairs who 
had employed her many years before, whom 
she had loved, and to whom she would have 
given herself had he not been already married. 
When Hilda has cut herself loose from all 
these Parisian complications, she goes to Lon- 
don, and there Doreyn once more comes into 
her life, making her realize that she has never 
really ceased to love him. He is broken in 
health, and his one desire is to see Hilda again, 
for which purpose indeed he has come abroad. 
They enjoy each other's companionship for a 
time, and Hilda, we are forced to believe, 
would in the end, had he lived, have defied the 
laws of society by living with him openly, so 
liberal an outlook upon life has she gained 
from her Parisian adventure. As it is, she is 
able to console his dying hour ; whereupon she 
returns to New York and takes her business 
duties once more upon her shoulders. Mr. 
Merwin calls his book " the story of a woman 
in revolt," and we have seen that her revolt 
carries her to the brink of the precipice. It is 
morally inconclusive (like so much of life 
itself), but, if we can only suspend the func- 
tion of moral judgment while we read, we 
shall not lack for variety of entertainment and 
deep human interest. Hilda and Moran and 
Doreyn are all genuine characters, and all 
make the strongest kind of an appeal to our 
sympathies. 

It is easy to be wise after the event, and any 
skilful practitioner in fiction could now pro- 
vide a prescient hero for a story of the great 
war. Such a hero is found in Mr. Oppen- 
heim's " The Double Traitor," which tells us 
of an English diplomatic attache who clearly 
understood, in the months preceding last 
August, what has since been so patently dis- 
closed, and who did his best to persuade a 
reluctant officialdom that Germany was about 
to put into execution her carefully matured 
plan for embroiling the world in strife. Fail- 
ing in his appeal to deaf ears and the in- 
vincible prejudice of those who believed it

impossible for Germany to do exactly what she 
has done, Francis Norgate went to work on 
his own account to save England from the 
worst consequences of that wanton attack upon 
civilization. Having himself been dismissed 
from his post in the legation at Berlin, he 
posed as a man with a grievance, and became 
apparently the tool of one Selingman, the head 
of the German spy -system in England. He 
seemed to be furnishing valuable reports to 
his employer, but they were framed only to 
deceive, and, as the critical day approached, he 
sought an interview with Mr. Churchill, found 
in him a willing listener, and so impressed 
him with his revelations that an order was 
given for the immediate mobilization of the 
fleet. Thus does history become the handmaid 
of fiction. The scene in which Selingman is 
finally trapped and marched off to the Tower, 
after learning how successfully Norgate has 
tricked him, is perhaps the most exciting that 
we owe to the author, accomplished purveyor 
of thrills though he be. The private romance 
of Norgate and the Baroness von Haase (of 
the Austrian secret service) makes a very 
acceptable love-story, but its interest is over- 
shadowed by the great affairs with which it is 
so intimately entangled. This capital story 
should make many new friends for Mr. Oppen- 
heim. 

There would obviously be something lacking 
in these days in any survey of current fiction 
that did not include one or more war stories, 
and it is indeed likely that the war will be 
responsible for an output of fiction as far 
beyond that occasioned by any other war as 
this conflict exceeds all others in magnitude. 
The last issue of THE DIAL contains the ap- 
palling statement that in Germany alone the 
closing months of 1914 witnessed the publica- 
tion of one and one-half million new patriotic 
songs. The inference from this as to novel- 
writing throughout the world simply staggers 
the imagination. Upon the present occasion, 
aside from the ante-bellum invention just de- 
scribed, we have something to say about three 
new books of war-fiction, the first two of them 
being what the British public knows as " shill- 
ing shockers," while the third is a far more 
serious artistic production. 

Mr. Guy Thome is the author of "The 
Secret Service Submarine," which tells how a 
schoolmaster on the Norfolk coast saved En- 
gland from a German invasion, and discom- 
fited as villainous a conspiracy of spies as ever 
existed even in the heated brain of a popular 
novelist. Says John Carey, the hero, on page 
147, " I am not going to describe everything I 
saw in detail. This is a story of action, and I 
always skip the descriptive parts in books, 



myself. The Johnnies only put them in to 
fill up." What he means is that he is not going 
to describe in detail, etc., but that is unimpor- 
tant. He certainly makes good his claim that 
" this is a story of action." Carey is an athlete 
with a game leg which unfits him for the active 
service of his country. Consequently, he be- 
comes a sub-master in a boys' private school 
kept by one Dr. Up jelly, who is in reality the 
Graf von Vedal, a German spy of the most 
resourceful and dangerous sort. The school is 
situated on a lonely stretch of the Norfolk 
coast, and the enemy communicates with the 
conspirators by means of a submarine which 
creeps up an inlet close to the establishment. 
When the story reaches its climax, the hero 
kills Vedal, and then, aided by his brother, 
who is a British naval officer, and by two boys 
from the school, captures the German sub- 
marine by a ruse, kills its crew, and then, 
setting out for sea with the prize, intercepts 
and torpedoes a German war-ship which is 
convoying a number of transports for the 
invasion of England, sinks or puts to flight the 
transports, and covers himself and his com- 
panions with glory. All the parties concerned 
in this exploit get commissions and Victoria 
crosses, and the hero gets besides Dr. Up jelly's 
step-daughter, who has given valiant aid to 
the enterprise. Cheap as the story is in any 
literary sense, it is an undoubted thriller, and 
a notable example of swift melodramatic 
action. 

Mr. Le Queux, who writes "At the Sign of 
the Sword," is a man of parts, favorably 
known to readers of sensational fiction. The 
story is Belgian in setting, and takes us to the 
early days of the invasion of that martyred 
country, whose glorious achievement in mak- 
ing the outcome of the war a foregone conclu- 
sion almost from the start saved Europe from 
destruction, and won for the Belgian people a 
fame that will shine undimmed for many cen- 
turies to come. Aimee de Neuville is the 
daughter of the richest man in Belgium, and 
is wooed (and prospectively won) by Edmond 
Valentin, a young lawyer of little wealth but 
bright prospects. The villain is one Armand 
Rigaux, an associate of Baron de Neuville in 
large financial affairs, and in reality a secret 
agent of Germany, preparing to betray Bel- 
gium into the hands of the enemy. He pays 
his addresses to Aimee, with the encourage- 
ment of her father, but they are loathesome to 
her, and she repels him with scorn. Edmond, 
meanwhile, knows of Rigaux's double-dealing, 
but a curious sense of honor forbids him to 
denounce his rival. When the storm bursts 
upon his devoted country, he takes his place 
in the ranks as an officer of artillery, while 



1915]

Aimee hides herself in the family chateau on 
the Meuse near Dinant. The invasion of the 
Huns soon plunges her into the midst of the 
fray, and almost makes her a victim of their 
savagery, when the opportune appearance of 
Edmond saves her from the worst outrage, 
and puts a highly fitting end to the arch- 
villain. After some days of storm and stress, 
with a piling up of horrors, and a series of 
hairbreadth escapes, the lovers make their 
way to Ostend, and find a safe haven across the 
Channel. We must quote one illustration of 
the author's vigorous hard-hitting : 

" The sun had set, and the red afterglow that 
crimson light of war was showing in the west 
over where lay Great Britain, the chief objective 
of the Kaiser and his barbaric horde of brigands, 
hangmen, executioners, and fire-bugs. the men 
doing the bidding of that blasphemous antichrist 
who was daily lifting his hands to Heaven and 
invoking God's blessing upon his hell-hound impie- 
ties." 

It makes a spirited tale, colored throughout 
with romantic sentiment. Whatever Mr. Le 
Queux cannot do, he at least can construct an 
effective plot, and carry it through with vigor 
and variety. 

Our remaining war novel is of a far more 
serious sort than the two just described, and 
belongs to literature as distinctly as they do 
not. ^It is entitled "The Splendid Chance" 
and is the work of Mrs. Mary Hastings Brad- 
ley, already well known as the author of a 
sterling historical romance, "The Favour of 
Kings" ; an Egyptian tale of love and mystery, 
" The Palace of Darkened Windows " ; and in- 
numerable short stories. Mrs. Bradley's hero- 
ine is a typical American girl, and .we first 
meet her as she embarks for Europe in the 
spring of 1914, with the intention of working 
in the art-schools of Paris. She comes from a 
New England college town, and is filled with 
artistic ambition. Among her fellow-passen- 
gers is an English army officer, Captain 
Edgerton, who cultivates her acquaintance, 
and gains with her a footing that promises 
romantic developments. This promise is later 
fulfilled when Edgerton visits Katherine in 
Paris, and friendship ripens into love. Mean- 
while, we make the acquaintance in Paris of 
Robert McNare, an American sculptor of 
genius, whose studio is just below Katherine's 
rooms. McNare is the victim of an unfor- 
tunate marriage with a faithless wife, from 
whom he is divorced, retaining custody of the 
little girl who is all the world to him. He is a 
morose and unapproachable person as far as 
women are concerned, but Katherine breaks 
down his defences when she devotes herself to 
Peggy, and saves her life one dreadful night 



when she is attacked by croup. But McNare 
sees that his love is hopeless when Edgerton 
appears upon the scene, and gnaws his heart 
out in silence. The stage is thus set for the 
real drama, which opens on the fatal First of 
August. This prologue, although it occupies 
half the volume, keeps us impatient for the 
appearance of the main theme, but it could not 
well be spared or even shortened. The tragedy 
that ensues is but one of millions bred of Ger- 
many's wanton onslaught upon the peace of 
Europe, but it is set before us with such 
poignancy, such vividness, and such sympa- 
thetic grasp that it is made a typical crystal- 
lization of the whole horrible meaning of the 
great war. It takes us to the front in Northern 
France, when the invader has been driven 
back from the gates of Paris. Katherine has 
given her services to the Red Cross, and it 
becomes her fate to find Edgerton lying on 
the battle-field, to receive his dying words of 
love, and to sit by his corpse in lonely vigil all 
night long. The pathos of this scene is well- 
nigh unbearable, and grips the heart as do few 
scenes with which we are acquainted in fiction. 
But the lesson of life is that no grief can 
utterly crush the spirit of youth, and after 
weeks of dumb agony made just possible to 
endure by the routine of her ministration to 
the wounded, Katherine returns to her Paris 
lodgings, and learns that McNare has been 
bereft of the sole joy of his life by a midnight 
bomb from the skies that has made his little 
Peggy its victim. The two stricken mortals 
find what solace they can in their mutual sym- 
pathies, and Katherine accepts McNare's 
escort to England, where they spend some 
weeks in the peaceful Cotswolds. And one 
morning in November, when Katherine, after 
a weary night, has risen before dawn, and 
climbed to the summit of a hill, life is sud- 
denly born anew in her, and the clan vital 
asserts its mastery over her shattered existence. 

" Suddenly she felt herself strong and enduring, 
even as the earth was enduring, and in the ele- 
mental clay her spirit burned with a new fire. . . . 
She felt glad. Life was not all horror while it 
held love and beauty, and love was not gone while 
memory lived. . . . Her heart was not empty! It 
held priceless memories of love and courage. Bitter 
that Jeffrey must be one of the martyrs in that 
struggle of the everlasting verities of freedom and 
right against undying stupidities and cruelties, but 
splendid for her that he had lived, that she had 
known him, that they had loved ! She looked out

The chapter from which these quotations are 
made offers us at once the best writing and 
the most vital philosophy of the entire book. 
Nothing remains but a kind of epilogue in 
which the two return to Paris, and discover 
that it is still possible for them, in companion- 
ship with one another, to patch up their broken 
lives, and be of some use to the world.

This is the deft and natural solution found by 
the author for her extremely difficult emo- 
tional complication, and this is the ending of 
a very tender, wise, and beautifully written 
story. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNE. 



NOTES ON NEW NOVELS. 

One reads rather dejectedly the earlier chapters 
of Mr. John Corbin's " The Edge" (Duffield), sus- 
tained rather by the thought that the author has 
never been guilty of trifling with his readers than 
by any evidence of it at hand. The reward comes 
after this preliminary lightness has been passed, 
for the book turns to an attempt to solve the bitter 
problem which decent Americans confront who are 
trying to have children and bring them up accord- 
ing to right standards. As one goes on, it becomes 
apparent that the author is going down to the cause 
itself, and that he finds it in the lack of a religion 
that affords a workable rule of life seven days in 
the week. It can hardly be said that Mr. Corbin 
mingles his propaganda with his fiction without loss 
to the latter, but he has nevertheless written a book 
that deserves reading. 

The problems arising from the passing of the 
old New England stock afflict the hero of Miss 
Honore Willsie's " Still Jim " (Stokes), who wishes 
to marry and have many children for the sake of 
perpetuating, with his family name, the ideals of 
the founders of so many of our best traditions. 
With this fundamental motive, Still Jim the 
qualifying adjective bespeaks his reticence 
enters the United States Reclamation Service, and 
there accomplishes noteworthy results, chief of 
which is overcoming those qualities in himself 
which have retarded the realization among us of 
the old ideals. The book is interesting in many 
ways, with the element of romance well sustained. 

If American novelists have in the main fallen be- 
hind their brethren of Great Britain, we are still 



able to point to several writers of short stories on 
this side of the Atlantic who may challenge com- 
parison with any abroad. Among these latter high 
rank must be given to Mrs. Katharine Fullerton 
Gerould, whose second volume, " The Great Tradi- 
tion and Other Stories " ( Scribner) , has now been 
published. It contains eight examples of short 
fiction, all but one bearing the same firm traces of 
masterly handling in much the same genre as char- 
acterized the author's earlier book. The reactions 
of persons of high intelligence and developed senti- 
ment are set before the reader's eyes recognizably 
and with an admirable power of analysis. Lovers 
of literary art will rejoice at this new evidence of 
Mrs. Gerould's skill. 

Mystery without murder implicit in the main, 
situation, and with a solution more carefully con- 
cealed and less in the nature of things than in most 
books of the sort, characterizes " Pals First "' 
(Harper), by Mr. Francis P. Elliott. What ap- 
pear to be a young escaped convict and an old 
clergyman who has served a term in an English 
prison for proved manslaughter descend as tramps 
upon a southern mansion. The young man is 
recognized by the old colored servants as their 
young master, and a highly elaborated scheme of 
deception follows. There is an amazing lack of 
good breeding in the supposedly cultured princi- 
pals, but the story moves well and there is a sense 
of fun in nearly every situation. 

The European element in modern America is 
widening our selection of literary topics. A few 
years ago such a book as Mr. James Oppenheim's 
" The Beloved " (Huebsch) would have been 
thought impossible. It deals with a common girl, 
the daughter of nobody, and a young New England 
writer and poet just arrived in New York. Through 
his love she finds herself at the end with her better 
nature and ambitions awakened, and entered upon 
a career as one of the most popular of moving- 
picture actresses. The boy had to be sacrificed to 
bring her to self-realization, and the earlier steps 
in their intercourse are shown with a fidelity to fact 
which would have startled an earlier generation. 

" Spray on the Windows " (Doran) is a well 
considered story of life in a small English seaside 
town, written by Mrs. J. E. Buckrose. It deals 
with the career of a girl who intends to bend life 
and love to her will, but who finds love too strong^ 
With the selfishness of youth, she plans to marry 
well. Becoming the highly valued companion of 
an old family friend, she somewhat artlessly en- 
gages the affections of the old lady's heir. But 
there has been a young neighbor, a man with whom 
fate has dealt hardly and unjustly ; and love beck- 
ons away from the ease she had longed for, and 
leaves her at the close of the book strong to work 
out a worthy destiny as wife and mother. 

Mr. Richard Marsh writes good detective stories, 
but seldom stories of good detectives. In " The 
Woman in the Car " (Lippincott) the officers of the 
law, after spending three hundred closely printed 
pages in looking for the murderer of a prominent 
financier, have the questionable satisfaction of see- 
ing the financier enter their office for the purpose 
of telling them their mistake. There are two other

deaths in the progress of the tale, but the police 
arrive at no result with regard to either of them, 
one passing as suicide and the murderess giving 
herself up for the other. The story has all the 
complications that the most exigent reader could 
demand. 

As a thoroughly complicated mystery story, with 
the solution well concealed until near its close, when 
the tangled skein is unravelled after the manner of 
a complicated chess problem, "A Silent Witness " 
(Winston), by Mr. R. Austin Freeman, is to be 
highly recommended. It opens with the murder to 
which readers of such stories are accustomed, fol- 
lowed by a suspicious death, and these in turn by 
several calculated attempts upon the life of a young 
English physician of the rather impenetrable 
type usual in such cases. A fellow-practitioner, 
but one in the field of medical jurisprudence, is the 
brains of the case. 

Miss Carolyn Wells has turned her attention of 
late to stories of mystery, one Fleming Stone being 
the M. Dupin of her narratives. " The White 
Alley " (Lippincott) is the latest of these, and he 
brings a murderer to book by means of a boy's mar- 
ble which, dropped from an attic, conducts him to 
the missing corpus delicti. It is done with a quite 
wonderful economy of effort, and little of the spec- 
tacularity usual on such occasions, but the story as 
a whole suggests that Miss Wells will do better 
when she becomes more accustomed to this sort of 
writing; the machinery creaks a little here. 

An old fashioned novel in its length and particu- 
larity of treatment is Mrs. Kathleen A. Lund's 
"Oliver in Willowmere" (Heath, Cranton & 
Ouseley). With the third chapter we are introduced 
to fully thirty characters who play parts through- 
out the story. Chief of these characters is a non- 
conformist clergyman who for a time preaches to 
a congregation in the fenland country of England. 
The people of the book are well differentiated, and 
many of them will constitute friends for the reader, 
coming as they do from all the walks of life in a 
small English town. 

The protagonist of " The Boss of the Lazy Y " 
(McClurg), by Mr. Charles Alden Seltzer, is a 
reckless, ill-natured brute to whom his father on 
his death leaves his ranch on condition that the son 
show signs of amendment. To a young girl he 
leaves the actual possession of the property, with 
the provision that it shall revert to her at the end 
of a year if the experiment fails. This is the basis 
for all that is worth while in the story, but it is 
complicated with a great deal of needless episode 
which hampers the plausibility of the whole sensa- 
tional yarn. 

Grown persons as well as children will find inter- 
est in " Pierrot, Dog of Belgium" (Doubleday), by 
Mr. Walter A. Dyer. Its hero is one of those super- 
serviceable animals of Flanders, bred for use as a 
hauler of burdens in peace, and graduated into the 
service of a small-gun battery when war broke upon 
his unhappy country. One may enter deeply into 
the feelings of a stricken people through this faith- 
ful medium, and both the dog and his masters are 
impressively drawn. 



Studies in 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

The Percy Turnbull Memorial 
Chaucer and Foundation in the Johns Hop- 

his times. i TT -i i i 

Kins University has brought 
forth some admirable lectures on poetry 
since E. C. Stedman in 1891 delivered the 
first of the series on " The Nature of Poetry." 
Unfortunately, too few of these have been 
published since Jebb and Tyrrell followed 
the excellent example of Stedman in giv- 
ing a wider publicity to their lectures. We 
are therefore very glad that Professor Kit- 
tredge, who lectured last year on " Chaucer 
and His Times," has had his lectures published 
( Harvard University Press) . There is no one 
in America more qualified to speak on Chaucer 
with discrimination and lively sympathy. He 
has interpreted the poet in terms of the pres- 
ent without any suggestion of cheap populari- 
zation. Chaucer moves before us as he did in 
that vital and interested age, pursuing his vast 
specialty, the study of mankind; and he be- 
trays in his work the artist whose great joy 
was in his fellow man. Four works are taken 
up in considerable detail, "The Book of the 
Duchess," " The House of Fame," " Troilus," 
and " The Canterbury Tales." It is hard to 
say which of these is most successfully treated ; 
perhaps the lecture on " The House of Fame " 
is the least pleasing and that on " Troilus " 
reveals the scholar's keenest enthusiasm. 
Especially good, just to mention a detail or 
two, is the discussion of the naivete of the 
" Book of the Duchess " as being that of the 
Dreamer (not Chaucer), who displays such 
insight into the needs of a heart bleeding with 
grief that he has been accused by unsympa- 
thetic and undiscerning critics as being dull 
of comprehension instead of showing the " art- 
less artfulness of a kindly and simple nature." 
" Troilus " is not merely " the most beautiful 
long narrative poem in the English language," 
as Rossetti termed it, but " the first novel, in 
the modern sense, that ever was written in the 
world, and one of the best." So the poem is 
considered as a tragedy of character growing 
out of the tragedy of situation, and especial 
study is made of the three great characters, 
Troilus, Cressida, and Pandarus, with the 
conclusion that something is amiss in this 
society with its code of love. When Troilus 
has died, " the great sympathetic ironist drops 
his mask, and we find that he has once more 
been studying human life from the point of 
view of a ruling passion (as he had done in 
' The House of Fame ') , and that he has, no 
solution except to repudiate the unmoral and 
unsocial system which he had pretended to up- 
hold." "The Canterbury Tales" are treated 



468 



THE DIAL 



[ June 10 



as a great drama in which the characters for 
the most part determine the action and the 
sequence of the tales. Especially is this seen 
in the Marriage Group, which begins with the 
Wife of Bath's Prologue and ends with the 
Franklin's Tale. It is rather remarkable that 
no reference is made to Professor Frederick 
Tupper's striking theory of Chaucer's use of 
the motifs of love and the seven deadly sins in 
binding these tales into a more complete unity 
than had hitherto been conceived of. A very 
interesting bit of interpretation is that of the 
lines at the close of the Pardoner's Tale when 
he suddenly and unexpectedly drops his cyn- 
icism and shows that he has not always been 
an assassin of souls: 

" And Jesu Crist, that is our soules leche, 

So graunte yow his pardon to receyve ; 

For that is best I wol nat yow deceyve." 
"A very paroxysm of agonized sincerity," to 
be followed immediately by " a wild orgy of 
reckless jesting." It is strange! 



< The mystery In considering what Tyndall has 
and the miracle expressively denoted " the mys- 
tery and the miracle of vitality," 
Mr. John Burroughs says : "I have had a 
good deal of trouble in trying to make my in- 
born idealism go hand in hand with my inborn 
naturalism ; but I am not certain that there is 
any real break or contradiction between them, 
only a surface one, and that deeper down the j 
strata still unite them." Nevertheless, in the 
dozen chapters of his book, " The Breath of 
Life" (Houghton), from which these words 
are quoted, he makes no visible progress, and 
doubtless did not expect to, toward establish- 
ing a connection between the two. The mys- 
tery of life, defying all explanation on the 
part of scientist and naturalist, is his theme, 
from beginning to end, under slightly varying 
aspects, as it has already been his chosen topic 
in some of his former writings. Citing with 
more or less of agreement or dissent such 
authorities as Darwin, Tyndall, Spencer, Hux- 
ley, Sir Edwin Ray Lankester, Professor 
Haeckel, and, with a different emphasis, Pro- 
fessor Bergson (to whom he not very long ago 
devoted a cordially appreciative chapter) , Mr. 
Burroughs presents in highly interesting and 
suggestive fashion a cursory view of the dif- 
ferent methods of approach to this fascinating 
and tantalizing problem, and, as was of course 
to be expected, leaves us at last as hopelessly 
and delightfully perplexed as we were in the 
beginning. The very breath of life to the 
problem is its insolubility. More than half 
the charm of the book, for most readers, is ex- 
plained in its author's prefatory confession of 
his own attitude toward his theme. " I am 



forced to conclude," he tells us, " that my pas- 
sion for nature and for all open-air life, 
though tinged and stimulated by science, is not 
a passion for pure science, but for literature 
and philosophy." His imagination and in- 
grained humanism, he adds, are appealed to 
by natural history, wherein he finds some- 
thing akin to poetry and religion. It is, in- 
deed, the poetry and the humanism of the book 
that render it so readable and make it litera- 
ture rather than science. A reproduction of 
Mr. Pietro's bust of the author is shown in the 
frontispiece. 

A notable new book by Dr. W. B. 
Cannon considers the subject of 
"Bodily Changes in Pain, Hun- 
ger, Fear, and Rage" (Appleton). As the 
result of an elaborate series of ingenious 
experiments, a distinct mechanism is estab- 
lished for the emotional support. The adrenal 
glands play a central part in it. It is a specific 
device for the intensification of energy, and the 
further protection of the organism when un- 
der extreme emotional excitement in urgent 
situations. To a minor degree the same order 
of process accompanies emotional excitement 
of a milder range. Pain, hunger, fear, and 
rage represent the situations of the struggle 
for existence or its incidents. It is in the 
interests of these that the evolution of the 
mechanism has proceeded. Adrenin increases 
the blood sugar, hurries coagulation (a vital 
matter in the bloody business of fighting) , and 
gives spurt to muscular energy. All these 
changes are detectable in the subjects of ex- 
citement both players and spectators of 
a football game, as also in the "before" 
and " after " of a severe examination. The 
mechanism is intimately psychic ; the emotion 
is essential to its summons. The fact that ani- 
mals share a comparable emotional disposition 
is established. As the human mouth waters 
at the sight of tempting food, so also will the 
flow of saliva in a dog be stimulated only when 
appetite is present. Contrariwise, nervous 
excitement stops the flow of the gastric juices; 
the reality of nervous indigestion is adequately 
sustained by physiological evidence. There 
are also illuminating side-lights upon the 
physiological setting of the emotional states ; 
not the least interesting of these is that the 
" emotional " defence of war has no exclusive 
vantage as against other active rivalries, such 
as sport. The central value of this able volume 
lies in its correlation of the physiological 
changes ; it thus gives a consistent interpreta- 
tion of certain hitherto obscure mechanisms of 
the emotional life. It is a positive and an 
important contribution.

international^ 111 wwot years there has been 
the Monroe an increasing disposition among 
students of American foreign 
policy to find fault with, the Monroe Doctrine 
as it is now interpreted ; and some, even, are 
beginning to denounce it as an obsolete shib- 
boleth, the continued enforcement of which 
by the United States alone is a wrong to the 
greater powers of South America and a con- 
stant source of danger to this country. Some 
demand that it should be abolished outright; 
others that it should be radically altered, and 
restored to its original character; still others, 
that it should be "internationalized," and 
other nations be invited to cooperate with the 
United States in the maintenance of the doc- 
trine. Among those who advocate the last- 
mentioned policy is Professor W. I. Hull of 
Swarthmore College, who has recently pub- 
lished a little volume of addresses entitled 
" The Monroe Doctrine : National or Inter- 
national" (Putnam), in which he maintains 
that the United States cannot expect to lay 
the foundation of permanent peace and genu- 
ine justice if it continues to insist on an exclu- 
sive responsibility for the doctrine. It is not 
only foolish but wrong, he argues, for a single 
nation to attempt to perform what is evi- 
dently a world-task. The rest of the world, 
we are told, has lost patience with our attempts 
to square our practice with our political the- 
ory, and it has become increasingly evident 
that the logical solution of the problem is the 
assumption of the rights and responsibilities 
which the doctrine entails, by the entire fam- 
ily of nations and its subjection to the institu- 
tions established at the Hague. There is much 
in this suggestion that will commend itself to 
thoughtful men; but there are still many to 
whom the idea will, as Professor Hull admits, 
appear to be little short of treasonable. 



. ,-,,, Few writers on charity work 

A contribution -,-,-, -, s a 

to social have had so long and varied an 

experience therein as Dr. Ed- 
ward T. Devine, General Secretary of the 
Charity Organization Society of New York 
City, and either past or present officer in many 
similar bodies engaged in the relief of distress 
and the amelioration of social evils. Thus his 
book, " The Normal Life," speaks with a meas- 
ure of authority that is none the less impres- 
sive by reason of its tentative, undogmatic 
way of presenting social problems and their 
possible solutions. He recognizes " how little 
we have done as yet about some things, how 
few are the consecrated workers, how limited 
our vision, how inadequate our practical appli- 
cation of that admirable principle of coopera- 
tion so constantly on our lips, how provincial 



and fragmentary all our philanthropy, even 
the best of it, how unworthy to be called either 
charity or justice, if by those noble words we 
mean what our fathers meant, or what our 
sons will mean by those or better terms describ- 
ing the better human relations which are to 
be." Instead of treating specifically any one 
or several of the pressing social problems, the 
author chooses " another method of approach, 
hoping that we may get both unity and propor- 
tion into our study, and perhaps see some old 
problems in a new light, if we take for our 
background the normal individual life, and, 
following it through from beginning to end, 
try to determine what are the social conditions 
and social provisions which are essential at 
each stage to securing it." This normal life he 
considers successively in its seven natural 
divisions, the pre-natal period, infancy, child- 
hood, adolescence, early maturity, full matur- 
ity, and old age; and that reader must be 
little interested in human welfare who fails to 
find the book full of suggestion. Its value to 
social workers is beyond question. Dr. Devine 
finds time, amid his other activities, to edit 
" The Survey," as many readers already know, 
and his present volume is published by the 
Survey Associates, of New York. 



As John Muir was known as the 
Father of the Yosemite, so Mr. 
Enos A. Mills might fairly be 
called the Father of Rocky Mountain Park. 
It is largely due to his untiring enthusiasm 
and perseverance that this magnificent bit of 
mountain scenery has been preserved for all 
time as a playground for the people. In his 
book, "The Rocky Mountain Wonderland" 
(Houghton), Mr. Mills describes this region 
of towering peaks, canyons, alpine meadows, 
forests, and lakes. But he does much more 
than this: his book is the record of one who 
has for many years lived on intimate terms 
with the Rockies and their wild inhabitants, 
and writes from the fulness of his knowledge. 
The titles of some of his chapters suggest 
the range of his knowledge and interest ; but 
they can give only a faint idea of the minute- 
ness and sympathy with which he has studied 
the life of the mountains, and none at all of 
the charming simplicity and directness of his 
style. He tells us intimate stories of Mountain 
Sheep, Grizzly Bear, Beaver, Silver Fox, 
Woodchuck, and Chipmunk; of the struggle 
for existence in winter snows; of the growth 
and decline of forests and mountain lakes ; of 
the birds and flowers that lend music, color, 
and fragrance to these high wildernesses; of 
the eccentricities of snow-slides; and of a 
hundred and one other things that make up

this mountain world of which most of us, even 
those who have spent many seasons in the 
Rockies, know so very little. And to illustrate 
his narrative, Mr. Mills has brought together 
a score or more of striking photographs of 
mountain life and scenery. Altogether the 
book is a notable one. 



Scientific information for the 
ex Perts and specialists in tropi- 
cal medicine and sanitation has 
grown with astonishing rapidity in the past 
decade, and popular treatises on restricted 
parts of the subject are available for the lay- 
man. However, no single book written from 
the elementary standpoint in simple concise 
form so fully covers the whole field as does Mr. 
W. Alexander Muirhead's " Practical Tropical 
Sanitation" (Button). The author has had a 
prominent part in the practical administration 
of the application of the science of preventive 
medicine under frontier conditions in the 
tropics. This probably explains the didactic 
tone of treatment, and the forceful presenta- 
tion as well as the minor omissions, imperfec- 
tions, and occasional scientific lapses. The 
book treats of the causes of avoidable tropical 
diseases, and their methods of social control, 
of mosquitoes and flies and the havoc they 
play by spreading malaria, sleeping sickness, 
and other forms of transmissible disease. The 
principles, methods, and official routine of 
inspection, disinfection, and police control are 
diagrammatically outlined. Ventilation, the 
protection of food and water, and the disposal 
of refuse are discussed in an elementary way, 
and sanitary law and practice are fully elabo- 
rated. The work is a valuable one for sani- 
tary constabulary, and for lay use by estates, 
mines, and all commercial enterprises in the 
tropics for popular instruction and social pro- 
tection. The reduction of the death rate 
among European officials in West Africa from 
90 to 11.8 per thousand between 1896 and 
1913 by sanitary measures is a convincing 
argument for the utility of the methods advo- 
cated in this manual. 



Determinism 
and romance. 



Pierre (Mme. Favre) de Coule- 
vain does not give us a book of 
fiction in "The Wonderful Ro- 
mance" (Dodd, Mead & Co.), but has availed 
herself nevertheless of her ability as a story 
teller in bringing together all sorts of inci- 
dents from real life, from history, and from 
religion, to show the world what enlighten- 
ment comes from complete acceptance of the 
doctrines of determinism. That we are under 
an immutable law, predetermined in its action 
down to the minutest detail, is her firm convic- 



tion, and free will she puts by as carefully as 
any Calvinist. That this law is beneficent in 
its operations, however things may seem, she 
proves as far as she can, and it serves to sup- 
port as buoyant an optimism as can well be 
imagined. By the light of her faith she exam- 
ines many incidents in her own experience, 
some of them trifles taken by themselves ; and 
passes from them to great sweeps of history, 
such as one finds in Gibbon, and to great 
human institutions, such as the Church of 
Rome. The universe is her field, at last, and 
everywhere is there evident to her eyes a great 
power, not ourselves, working for righteous- 
ness. Needless to say, the individual counts 
for comparatively little in such a philosophy. 
But the writer's outlook is clear and hopeful, 
and the book is well written and entertaining 
even when seeking most to be instructive. The 
translation, made by Miss Alys Hallard, leaves 
much to be desired. The work is dedicated to 
America, ' ' Country of New Thoughts. ' ' 



The universal actions have been Sim- 

appeal o/ pie, and all great pictures are, 

says Emerson, whom Professor 
Edwin Watts Chubb appositely quotes in 
opening his " Sketches of Great Painters," a 
series of untechnical chapters offered by one 
who, as he modestly explains, thought he 
might, " knowing so little about art . . be able 
to interest the ' hoi polloi ' who know even 
less." Accordingly he has set down the things 
that interest him, and that will interest many 
others, in regard to certain masters, old and 
modern, and their masterpieces. Appreciative 
comment, biographical information, and char- 
acteristic anecdote, all find appropriate place 
in the fifteen sketches dealing with as many 
artists, not arranged in chronological or any 
other order, apparently, but introduced each 
as the impulse moved. Thus Raphael heads 
the list and Van Dyck stands at the foot, while 
between them are scattered Millet, Leonardo 
da Vinci, Rembrandt, Whistler, Turner, Ti- 
tian, Rubens, Corot, Michael Angelo, Rey- 
nolds, Murillo, Velasquez, and Rosa Bonheur. 
The author has spent many hours in the chief 
picture-galleries of Europe and America, so 
that his present work is no hasty production 
of the moment. Gifted with a taste for the 
best in art, he renders intelligent aid to his 
readers in the appreciation of that best, and 
does it in so unobtrusive and undogmatic a 
manner as to ingratiate himself at once with 
the " hoi polloi " whom, with humorous self- 
depreciation, he hopes to interest. Eighteen 
reproductions of well-known masterpieces are 
provided, and the book is published in pleasing 
form by the Stewart & Kidd Co. of Cincinnati.

m nmn ' i n , Amid the welter of Feministic 

Woman s place . 

in modern literature, Mrs. Florence Guerin 

Tuttle's "The Awakening of 
Woman " (Abingdon Press) should take an 
honorable place. Despite the continual striv- 
ing after phrasal felicities, and the rather pro- 
nounced oratorical style, there is so much 
truth and such a degree of reasonableness in 
it that it must do the cause good in quarters 
which have hitherto been impervious. The 
chapters dealing with " Woman and Genius," 
" Creative Womanhood," and " Motherhood " 
are the least provocative of irrelevant objec- 
tions. The analysis of the conditions necessary 
to genius is very good, but certainly many 
sympathetic readers will find the writer's 
selection of Madame Montessori, Madame 
Curie, and Mary Baker Eddy as the three 
greatest geniuses among modern women a 
curious one. " The Revaluation of Life " and 
" The Relation to Eugenics " are not so sanely 
reasonable. The author makes the common 
mistake of assuming that children, especially 
female children, have only one parent, a 
mother; also that the father's relation to the 
child is nearly, if not altogether, a material 
one. She is also peculiarly responsible for 
the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy that the 
immense recent progress in eugenics is due to 
the work of women. The book has not been 
sufficiently revised for perfect coherence ; but 
it is on the whole stimulating, suggestive, and 
distinctly worth while. 



New edition SeV6n y eaFS a g the ReV ' John 

of a handbook P. Jones, D.D., produced an un- 
usually good introductory book 
on "India: Its Life and Thought" (Mac- 
millan). It was frankly intended for readers 
who were not familiar with the field, and was 
"based on thirty years of matured expe- 
rience ' ' in the most interesting land under the 
sun. Naturally, the author's point of view 
was given by his life work ; but he tried to be 
scrupulously fair, and has succeeded much 
better than many of his fellow workers. The 
first edition had four successors, and on the 
whole this popularity has been deserved. 
However, we have one serious protest to enter : 
the references to political India should have 
been brought up to date in the issue of 1915, 
lately published. It is simply absurd to print 
in a book appearing this year the following 
statement about Lord Morley's famous reor- 
ganization : ' ' Even at the present time the 
Secretary of State for India has introduced a 
scheme which will add materially to the power 
of India in the conduct of its own affairs." 
Similarly, there is no excuse for quoting the 
census of 1901 when the figures for 1911 have 



been available so long. Furthermore, why 
should our best publishing houses not adopt 
the plan of printing distinctly on the title- 
page the number of the edition, with the date 
of the work's original appearance? Of course 
we may usually turn the leaf over and find 
this information in small type ; but the more 
direct method has every advantage. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

" Outlines and Summaries " (Holt), a little man- 
ual prepared by Professor Norman Foerster for the 
use of freshmen in college, presents a formal and 
practical method of teaching students how to make 
analyses of expository essays. The illustrative 
material is fresh and interesting, and the compiler's 
enthusiasm for his task is very clearly reflected 
throughout. 

"Readings from American Literature" (Ginn), 
by Mary Edwards Calhoun and Emma Leonora 
MacAlarney, is a textbook combining both prose 
and verse. It will be welcomed, as something that 
has long been needed, even though the idiosyncra- 
cies of the editors, and no doubt copyright difficul- 
ties as well, have prevented it from being as repre- 
sentative as many teachers will wish. The space 
given to seventeenth and eighteenth century writers 
seems proportionally too great, at least for high 
school students; and several later writers who 
should be included in even a hurried survey of 
American literature are omitted altogether. But the 
selections are in general well made. 

For children who find the transition from the 
rhythmic work of the kindergarten to the more 
elaborate folk and aesthetic dancing somewhat diffi- 
cult, and consequently uninteresting, Mrs. Irene E. 
Phillips Moses has arranged a book on " Rhythmic 
Action: Plays and Dances" (Milton Bradley Co.), 
that is adapted to the needs of the primary school, 
playground, and gymnasium. Many of the rhymes 
are from "Mother Goose"; the others are all 
popular favorites, or else have been chosen because 
of their contemporary or nature-study interest. 
Illustrations and music add to the usefulness of the 
volume, which has been prepared primarily to give 
pleasure to active, healthy childhood. 

The California missions have received their full 
share of attention during the past two years, owing 
to the adventitious interest derived from the Pan- 
ama-Pacific Exposition. Accordingly, Messrs. J. 
Smeaton Chase and Charles Francis Saunders have 
been at some pains to give a new turn to their 
treatment of " The California Padres and Their 
Missions" (Houghton). They begin with the per- 
sonal contact with the traveller with each mission, 
and end with some personal reminiscence of one or 
another padre connected with the mission discussed. 
The volume is an intimate and sociable guide-book, 
the material of which seems to be trustworthy, 
excepting where it frankly gives rein to the imag- 
ination. The making of the book, including the 
illustrations, is well up to the high standard which 
we have come to expect from the publishing house 
whose imprint it bears.

NOTES. 

A new edition of Messrs. Harper's ten-volume 
" Encyclopaedia of United States History " will be 
issued at an early date. 

During the autumn a new edition of the works 
of Oscar Wilde, in thirteen volumes, will be pub- 
lished by Messrs. Putnam. 

An English translation of General Joffre's 'book, 
" My March to Timbuctoo," with an introductory 
sketch by Mr. Ernest Dimnet, will soon be issued 
by Messrs. Duffield. 

A translation by Miss Mary Blaiklock of M. 
Remain Holland's " Musiciens d'Autrefois," will 
shortly be published under the title of " Some 
Musicians of Former Days." 

Mr. William Lindsey's drama, "Red Wine of 
Rousillon," which was announced by Messrs. 
Houghton Mifflin Co. for publication this spring, 
will not appear until autumn. 

A volume entitled " Citizens in Industry," by the 
late Dr. Charles R. Henderson, will be published 
this month by Messrs. Appleton. This house has 
also in press an account of " Sanitation in Pan- 
ama " by Major-General W. C. Gorgas. 

" Others," a new monthly devoted to the interests 
of poetry, will make its initial appearance this 
month. The editors are Messrs. Alfred Kreymborg 
and Walter Conrad Arensberg, and the magazine 
will be issued temporarily from Ridgefield, N. J. 

In ' the immediately forthcoming volume, " The 
Japanese Problem in the United States," by Mr. 
H. A. Millis, the author discusses two phases of 
the question, the admission of Japanese immi- 
grants and the treatment accorded those who are 
already here. 

" The Note Book of an Attache," by Mr. Eric 
Fisher Wood, will be one of this month's publica- 
tions of the Century Co. The author, who was 
studying architecture at the Beaux Arts in Paris 
when the war broke out, offered his services imme- 
diately to the American Embassy in Paris, and has 
had several months' experience at the front. 

A new poetic drama on the war has been written 
by Mr. Stephen Phillips and will be published in 
book form by Mr. John Lane probably next month, 
under the title of "Armageddon." The drama is in 
three acts, with a prologue in which the shade of 
Attila is dispatched by Satan to take possession of 
the Kaiser's person. The scene of the first act is 
laid outside Reims; that of the last in Cologne, 
with the Allied forces. 

Mrs. Ghosal (or Scrimati Svarna Kumari Devi) , 
the sister of Rabindranath Tagore, whose Indian 
romance "An Unfinished Song" was published in 
an English translation about a year ago, has trans- 
lated another of her novels for early issue, under 
the title " The Fatal Garland." The story, which is 
illustrated by native artists, is written round some 
events of Indian history of the fourteenth century, 
and contains much of Hindu philosophy. 

An English publishing house will shortly publish 
on the same date two books on Mr. Bernard Shaw, 
in one of which he is proclaimed as " the twentieth 
century Moliere," and in the other denounced under 



the title " Common Sense about the Shaw." The 
first work is an English edition of the study of Mr. 
Shaw by Augustin Hamon, translated from the 
third French edition by Eden and Cedar Paul. 
The denunciation has been written by Mr. Harold 
Owen, part author of the play " Mr. Wu." 

A new edition is in preparation of " The Col- 
lected Works of Aphra Behn," in six volumes, 
printed by Mr. A. H. Bullen at the Shakespeare 
Head Press, Stratford-on-Avon, under the editor- 
ship of Mr. Montague Summers. More than forty 
years have elapsed since the last edition of Aphra 
Behn was issued, and that was merely a reprint, 
with no attempt at serious editing, omitting much 
of her work, including all her poetry. Even in its 
incomplete state, the edition of 1874 has become 
rare and costly. 

The place of Belgium in the modern world of 
letters is estimated in Mr. Jethro Bithell's study of 
" Contemporary Belgian Literature," which Mr. 
Fisher Unwin of London will shortly publish. The 
author traces the development of recent Belgian 
literature from about the year 1880 when a group 
of students at Louvain, including Emile Verhaeren,. 
began the campaign for new ideals in the Uni- 
versity magazines down to the present day. Ex- 
amples are given of the best work of representative 
authors, especially of the poets. 

The latest number to reach us of " Special Li- 
braries" Vol. 6, No. 4 (April, 1915) contains 
an article of some length, and rich in noteworthy 
facts, on " Organized Information in the Use of 
Business," by Mr. John A. Lapp, Director of the 
Indiana Bureau of Legislative Information; a 
shorter article on " Handling a Large Circulation 
in an Office Library," by the librarian of the Pub- 
lic Service Commission Library of New York City ; 
a fourteen-page " List of References on Municipal 
Accounting," and a page or more of names of 
bibliographies relating to municipal administra- 
tion, social work, the present war, and other 
subjects. 

The recent death in the Dardanelles of the prom- 
ising young English poet and critic, Rupert Brooke,, 
has naturally led to a decided general interest in 
his work. There will soon appear a volume con- 
taining all the poems written by him since the 
appearance of his 1911 volume. The new book 
will be called " 1914, and Other Poems," and will 
contain a photogravure portrait. The five 1914 
sonnets will come first in the book; then a group 
called " The South Seas " ; then a number of 
" Other Poems " ; and then " The Old Vicarage." 
We may expect it to be followed by a collected 
edition including the poems, the book on Webster, 
the critical articles, and the prose sketches which 
were among the most charming things that Brooke 
wrote, 

" State Documents for Libraries " is the title of 
a carefully written pamphlet of 163 pages, form- 
ing No. 36 of Vol. 12 of the " University of Illi- 
nois Bulletin." Mr. Ernest J. Reece, of the Library 
School of that university is its author, and he has 
grouped his matter under six heads, " The Field 
of State Documents," " The Selection of State 
Documents for Libraries," " Description of State 



1915]

Departments and Documents," " The Treatment of 
State Documents in Libraries," " The Distribution 
of State Documents," and " Bibliographical Mat- 
ter." The methods of distribution in our different 
states are fully described, and suggestions are 
offered for " a model law on printing and distri- 
bution." All librarians are more or less tormented 
by the public-document problem, and they will 
welcome this able monograph on the subject. 

The "Twentieth Annual Report" of the John 
Crerar Library notes the unavoidable injurious 
effect of the war upon its activities, and yet chron- 
icles encouraging progress in growth and useful- 
ness. Additional room has been secured on the 
seventh floor of the building where the library is 
now situated, pending the erection of a building 
of its own, which the directors have decided not 
to begin until 1917. Unusually long, compared 
with that of other libraries, is the list of donors 
to the John Crerar Library for the year 1914; it 
fills forty-five double-column fine-print pages. A 
biographical notice of the late Eliphalet Wiekes 
Blatchford, director from the foundation of the 
library, and since 1900 chairman of the committee 
on administration, is contained in the Report. 

An intimate picture of Roman social and family 
life under the Napoleonic regime is contained in 
" The Patrizi Memoirs," by the Marchesa Madda- 
lena Patrizi, translated by Mr. Hugh Fraser, which 
will appear shortly. The book is based on letters 
and diaries collected by the author through years 
of research in France and Italy and printed for 
family circulation some years ago. It is now pre- 
sented to the public for the first time, with an 
historical introduction by Mr. J. Crawford Fraser. 
The worst side of Napoleon's character is revealed 
in his treatment of the Marchese Giovanni Patrizi 
and his wife, who, as the Princess Cunigonda of 
Saxony, and cousin of Louis XVI., roused the worst 
hatred of the Emperor. The records serve to show 
that whereas the harsh treatment of those who were 
considered dangerous and recalcitrant Catholics 
T^as left to the officials, Napoleon himself made 
that of the Patrizi family his personal affair. 

We quote the following interesting paragraph 
from the London " Nation " : " Sir William Robert- 
son Nicoll has not abandoned his project of writing 
a history of English periodical literature in the 
Victorian era. We have become so accustomed to 
periodicals that it is not easy to realize the extent 
-of their influence on the world of books. They 
Tiave certainly affected the development of prose 
style, something of the form as well as the content 
of our fiction is due to them, and it is through them 
that the greater part of our literary criticism has 
been introduced to the world. ' If any one will run 
over in his mind the list of the most remarkable 
critical books of the last fifty years/ says Pro- 
fessor Saintsbury, ' he will find that scarcely one 
in ten, perhaps not one in twenty, has had an 
original appearance wholly independent of the 
periodical.' ' To write articles for money and 
books for love ' is often a convenient arrangement, 
and not the least of the services of the periodicals 
is that they have enabled men of letters to gain a 
livelihood without sacrificing their independence."

The Yale Review 

The New American Quarterly 



The Fate of the Dardanelles 

the leading article, is by Sir Edwin Pears, the foremost 
British authority on the Near East. He writes significantly, 
from personal experience. The greatest of American ex- 
perimental biologists, Jacques Loeb of the Rockfeller 
Institute, writes on the mechanistic theory of the origin 
of life. Charles Cheney Hyde, professor of interna- 
tional law in Northwestern University, interprets 
the acts of the United States in defense of our 
rights on the sea. Professor Wilbur C. Abbott of Yale 
searches out the root of the present European conflict in 
the age-long struggle between democracy and autocracy. 
John Crowe Ransom in a brilliant analysis prefers to find 
its cause in the irreconcilable strife between two concep- 
tions of justice, the old, or static, and the new, or creative, 
which progressive Germany has embraced. The number 
is completed by authoritative articles on our rights on the 
sea, home rule for cities and other important subjects, and 
by poems and essays by Amy Lowell, Henry A. Beers, Vida 
D. Scudder, Elisabeth Woodbridge and Louis Untermeyer. 
There are also fifteen authoritative reviews of significant 
books. The subscription price is {2.50, including the above

(In four parts] 



By JOHN J. PLEGER 



T 



HIS work, the first and only complete text-book in this country that covers the 
subject in all its phases, will prove of great interest and value to every one con- 
nected directly or indirectly with bookbinding. 

John J. Pleger, the author, is an advanced exponent of the art, and has given the 
trade, in concise, comprehensive form, the benefit of his broad knowledge. 

The smaller printer who has to do binding as a side line will find herein a mine of 
helpful information. 

It will be found invaluable by the larger binders when the time comes for purchas- 
ing additional or new equipment. 

To the involuntary specialist the man whose limitations have tied him to one 
operation it will prove a boon in widening his opportunities for better employment 
and remuneration. 

Librarians and others intrusted with the "care" of books will find Mr. Pleger 's 
offering well worth attention.
