The Best Books for Summer Reading 



ANNE of GREEN GABLES 

By L. M. MONTGOMERY. Illustrated. $1.50. 

Here is a book which will be recommended by one friend to another until the sayings of Anne become house- 
hold words. Mr. Temple Scott, who read advance proofs, says : 

" It is delightful in a way that is different from the usual ways in which we experience that emotion. 
. . . As for Anne herself, she is a gem, even with her red hair and freckles. We should dearly have 
enjoyed Anne Shirley in the flesh." 

The. Boston Herald says: "It could have been written only by a woman of deep and wide sympatliy. . . . 
Throughout this delightful story reminds one of the captivating humor of ' Mrs. Wig^s of the Cabbage Patch.' '" 



A New Nature Book by CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS 

THE HOUSE IN THE WATER 

A BOOK OP WILD LIFE 

Illustrated by Charles Livingston Bull and Frank Vining Smith. $1.50. 

" Those who have read ' The Heart of the Ancient Wootl,' ' The Watchers of the Trails,' and ' Poems,' need no 

introduction to Charles G. D. Roberts, nor any inducement to read a new volume from his pen." — Hartford Courant. 

" He is the most literary as well as the most imaginative and vivid of all the nature writers." — Brooklyn Eagle. 



THE MAKING OF 
PERSONALITY 

By BLISS CARMAN 

Boxed, $1.50. 
" Bliss Carman is perhaps the most 
interesting of essayists now writing 
in English. The sweet reasonableness 
of his pronouncements ; the charming 
manner of presentation ; the absence 
of the cant which bo often clutters 
similar writings, all these things com- 
mend the book to those who under- 
stand that cul- 
tivation must 
include body, 
mind and spirit 
to secure bal- 
ance and poise 
in each of the 
three." — The 
Chicago JVews. 




PEGGY AT 
SPINSTER FARM 

By HELEN M. WINSLOW 

Author of " Literary Boston," etc. 
Illustrated with many original photo- 
graphs. $1.50. 

Whatever Miss Winslow writes is 
good, for she is in accord with the 
life worth living. The Spinster, her 
niece "Peggy," the Professor, and 
young Robert Graves,— not forgetting 
Hiram, the hired man, — are the char- 
acters to whom we are introduced 
in " Spinster Farm." Light-hearted 
character sketches and equally re- 
freshing and unexpected happenings 
are woven together with a thread of 
happy romance of which Peggy, of 
course, is the vivacious heroine. Al- 
luring descriptions of nature and 
country life are also given. 



IN THE WOODS AND 
ON THE SHORE 

A BOOK FOR SPORTSMEN 

By RICHARD D. WARE 

Illustrated with foll-iiage drawings 
by Charles Livingston Bull, and 
reproductions of photographs taken 
by the author. 

8vo, cloth. $2.00. 

'' Here we have not only a record of 
absorbing interest to the sportsman, 
but also a fascinating nature book for 
the stay-at-home. It is a book that 
appeals to the reader ; it grives him the 
taste of real outdoor life; the very 
essence of the glory and enthusiasm 
of vigorous, hearty American exist- 
ence in the fields and forests." 

— The Boston Journal.

JFfction 31u$t 3$0ueti 



THE BARRIER 

By REX BEACH. It is a big novel — no problem, no preaching, no politics —just a big, daring, love story of 
Alaska. The critics say it is even better than " The Spoilers." " THE BARRIER" is the one novel that 
everybody will read this summer — and in the promise of a surfeit of politics such a diverting story is refresh- 
ing. Striking pictures in colors. Cloth. Post 8vo $1.50 

R. J.'S MOTHER and Some Other People 

By MARGARET DELAND. In these stories Mrs. Deland has embodied the heart of her teuder, truthful 
genius. As for "R. J.'s Mother," the author never more successfully wrought a story containing such deep 
and simple elements — two lives that have suffered and come together through the common experience of 
love. The reader will find himself face to face here with the big things of life that find their way into common 
experience. Illustrated. PostSvo. Cloth $1.50 

THE SHOULDERS OF ATLAS 

By MARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN. " It helps to reveal the secrets of life," exclaimed a woman of this 
novel. It is that sort of a story. A man and his wife in a New England village come into the property of an 
elderly cousin, who disinherits her own daughter by so doing. This child. Rose Fletcher, is one of the rare 
types Mrs. Freeman draws so truly, with dignity, refinement, and breadth of character. A mystery involves 
everybody to the end. With frontispiece. Cloth $1.50 

KING SPRUCE 

By HOLM AN DAY. Reality is the keynote of this big new novel — a dashing, healthy story, breathing the 
vigor of its scene — the woods of Maine. This realm of King Spruce vibrates with the rushing life — and life 
means strife — of the struggle with logs and lumber barons. A plucky young man, in love with the daughter 
of the chief of those barons, fights his fight amid the perils of drifting snow, rushing logs and reckless men. 
Pictures in colors. Cloth. Post 8vo $1.50 

SIR RICHARD ESCOMBE 

By MAX PEMBERTON. They are a likable lot, these courteous fighting-men and winsome, prankish women 
of the Georgian era. The novel is a delightful chapter out of picturesque yesterday — but with the nearness of 
reality you feel for your neighbors to-day. Lady Kitty is a flesh-and-blood heroine, while there is a touch 
of genuine fun all through the character of stupid, honest, gallant Sir Richard Escombe. With frontispiece. 
Cloth $1.50. 

THE SERVANT IN THE HOUSE 

By CHARLES RANN KENNEDY. We do not publish plays, but here is a drama so great, so compelling, so 
reverent, so akin to all the beautiful and permanent things in life that it is more than a play, more than a 
novel, more than a mere book. According to the critics, " Not in a lifetime has such a wonderful play been 
created " — and it reads as well as it acts. Illustrated. PostSvo. Cloth . . $1.25 

SANTA LUCIA 

By MARY AUSTIN. In simple fashion this tale begins to reflect the lives of a number of Interesting persons 
in Santa Lucia, with its pretentious suburbs, its aspiring college and narrow social order. It moves gradually 
into a powerful and rapid narrative — a genuine story. It is a pleasure to add that the book has uncommon 
literary excellence as well. Cloth. Post 8vo $1.50 

BERTRAND OF BRITTANY 

By WARWICK DEEPING. A dashing tale of knights, tourneys, chivalry, adventure, and heroism. The man- 
hood of Bertrand and his unselfish love soften a story that is wild adventure. Cloth. Post 8vo . $1.50 

THE GOLDEN ROSE 

By AME LIE RIVES. The theme of "The Golden Rose "is delicately emotional. An exquisite, exotic woman 
is dominated by a mystical belief concerning the highest relation of lovers, which denies for herself, at least, 
the fulfillment of love in marriage. Post 8vo. Cloth $1.25 



Beto 2:fl3ork0 of Importance 



ASTRONOMY WITH THE NAKED EYE 

By GARRETT P. SERVI8S. At last here is a little book on astronomy for us who want to know just the 
plain things about the stars. No telescopes, no special knowledge required — and it reads like a novel — only 
better. With many charts and illustrations ^et, $1.40 

THE STANDARD OF USAGE IN ENGLISH 

By Professor THOMAS R. LOUNSBURY. A spirited and practical book, denying that English is degener- 
ating through corrupt usage. A spoken language not only does change, but should change. Gilt top. 
Untrimmed edges. Price iVet, $1.50 

THE TECHNIQUE OF THE NOVEL 

By Professor CHARLES F. HORNE, Ph.D. For the student and for the writer — a long needed book. It treats 
carefully and fully of the elements of the art, their evolution and present use. Cloth. Post 8vo. JVet, $1.60 

HYPNOTIC THERAPEUTICS 

By Dr. JOHN D. QUACKENBOS, A.M. Mental healing is one of the most vital problems to-day. Assistance, 
both careful and authoritative, will be found in this book. It is in direct line with the great movement for 
mental treatment and siiggestion. Cloth. 8vo. 333 pp -^e<, $2.00

Life and Letters of 

HERBERT SPENCER 

By David Duncan, D.Sc, LL.D. 

His Literary Executor and Intimate Friend. 

THIS is in no sense an exposition or criticism of the philosophy of evolution, but a 
narrative of Spencer's life based upon his correspondence. In his w^ill Spencer 
requested Dr. Duncan to write his biography, and it w'xW therefore be seen that this is the 
only authoritative one on his life. 

" It will doubtless be generally recognized that the most important book thus far 
published during the current year is the ' Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer.' " 

— New York Sun. 

" Its value lies in its verity, in its point of view, in its frank statements of false as well 

as sound views of art and literature, of life itself; in short, in its unquestioned sincerity."

The Government of England 



By A. LAWRENCE LOWELL of Harvard University 

" Professor Lowell's long-expected book will fully justify the expectations which have

important and valuable study in government and polities issued since Bryce's ' American 
Commonwealth,' and perliaps also the greatest work of this character produced by any 
American scholar." " Much is here made plain that is usually somewhat of a mystery to 
the American reader and is even imperfectly understood by the average Englishman."

THE SUMMER SHOW. 



This is the time when the question of sum- 
mer entertainment, or diversion, or occupation, 
becomes insistent, and many are the answers 
that are offered to more or less willing ears. A 
few fortunate people have quite definite answers 
of their own, and need no counsel ; the great 
majority, we imagine, are in different case, and 
approach their vacation time with very hazy 
notions concerning its most profitable use. 
They are chiefly impressed by the fact that it 
means a vacation from the irksomeness of the 
year's routine, and they do not greatly care if 
it remain vacant of any kind of real content. 
The craving for mere rest becomes so strong as 
the solstice approaches that even the making of 
plans becomes a burden, and relaxation alone 
seems a satisfaction whoUy sufficient for the 
needs of both body and mind. But since we 
have taken the word " vacation " in its literal 
meaning, we may perhaps with equal propriety 
take the word " recreation " in the same way, and 
ask if there be not some better means of renew- 
ing the springs of energy and of restoring the 
lost vitality than are offered by sheer idleness. 
The wholesome work of re-creation goes on in 
idleness, no doubt, as it does in sleep ; but 
possibly its pace may be quickened and its bene- 
fits enhanced by taking a little thought and 
exercising some degree of foresight. 

One aspect of the question is suggested by the 
thought of summer reading. Following a some- 
what conventional tradition, this journal every 
year supplies its readers with lists of new books 
in the domains of popular fiction, country life, 
the study of nature, and the world brought to 
our ears by travellers' report. It is well to 
emphasize these classes of literature in the sum- 
mer time, and to forbear overmuch stress upon 
history and science, to say nothing of such unin- 
viting themes as sociology and pedagogy and 
politics. Juiceless reading is what no one wants 
in summer, however strange the tastes that 
may have been acquired at and for other seasons 
of the year. But because the reading suit- 
able for summer excludes whole categories of 
books there is no reason why it should select, 
from the categories of which it approves, only 



6 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



books of frivolous type, which make no demand 
upon the intelligence. It is to be presumed that 
a healthful stimulus to thought and feeling is as 
necessary for our weeks of play as for our months 
of work. This does not mean that we want the 
same kind of reading for all seasons, but it does 
mean that all our reading should be worth while. 
And there is one kind of reading, apt to be 
neglected in more strenuous times, which pre- 
eminently belongs to summer, and that is the 
reading of poetry. We hasten to add, lest the 
thought prove too alarming, that we do not mean 
all kinds of poetry, even of good poetry, for all 
kinds of readers. We should hesitate to urge 
" Paradise Lost " upon the reluctant idler, but 
would like to recommend the " Faery Queene " 
to his consideration ; we would not be hard- 
hearted enough to advise that he wrestle with 
" The Ring and the Book," but we feel assured 
of his gratitude if he will follow our advice 
and make acquaintance with " The Earthly Par- 
adise." 

What we started out to do, however, was to 
talk about summer shows, and not about sum- 
mer books. Summer itself is one of the greatest 
of aU shows (as Richard Jefferies knew); but 
the word is now used in its more limited sense. 
As warm weather approaches, a curious phenom- 
enon is noticeable in the theatres of all our large 
cities. As by common consent, the purveyors 
of dramatic entertainment for the midtitude 
withdraw from the boards every " attraction " 
that has any claim to be called legitimate drama, 
and substitute a species of show that is not even 
fit, as someone remarked to us the other day, 
to be offered for the attention of convalescent 
lunatics. The vaudeville crazy-quilt and the 
incoherent inanity of what is styled musical 
comedy (although it is neither musical nor 
comic) constitute the only sort of fare we are 
likely to get in our summer theatres. Any- 
thing resembling a play will be sought for in 
vain. Now it is our fixed belief that only mis- 
guided persons will resort to the theatre at all 
on a hot summer evening, and those who are 
thus aberrant of judgment or lacking in a sense 
of the fitness of things probably get no severer 
ptmishment than they deserve ; but if play- 
houses are to be kept open, and people are 
willing to enter them, it does seem a pity that 
some of them at least should not be doing the 
sort of work for which the play-house primarily 
exists. We would not exactly urge the desir- 
ability of summer productions of " Othello " 
and "Hamlet," or of the plays of Ibsen, but we 
would make a plea for some sort of genuinely 



dramatic offering, the premise once granted that 
the boards are to be occupied at all. 

Since the only proper place to spend a warm 
summer evening is out of doors, it follows that 
the ideal summer show should have the sky for 
its roof, the greensward for its stage floor, and 
interlacing trees for its proscenium arch. This 
is a combination not easily to be worked in 
connection with the drama, although such in- 
stances as the Shakespearian performances of 
Mr. Ben Greet, and the recent production of 
" Comus " upon the campus of the Northwestern 
University, will at once occur to the mind. 
Here at least is the right idea, and it has many 
possibilities as yet undeveloped. It represents 
the good extreme, as contrasted with the bad 
extreme offered by the sensational spectacle that 
may be witnessed in the average amusement 
park. We should imagine that English liter- 
ature would provide many works suitable for 
open-air performance besides the few that have 
already become somewhat hackneyed by use, 
and that new authors might find a promising 
opportunity in the composition of works ex- 
pressly designed for this kind of presentation. 
In all such efforts, music should play as large 
a part as possible, for those who have witnessed 
sylvan performances of " A Midsummer Night's 
Dream " and " The Tempest " know that it is 
the musical accompaniment that sets the crown- 
ing touch of charm upon those hours of outdoor 
delight. And music, at least, we may always 
have on summer evenings ; for that needs no 
theatrical accessories. Perhaps it is ungracious 
to ask for more than that, for the great tone- 
poets have outdone all the dramatic word- 
mongers in portraying thought and feeling, in 
setting problems and solving them, in penetrat- 
ing to the very heart of life and revealing the 
secret springs of its inspiration. 



Keeping in touch with good literature, says 
one of the thousands of commencement orators who 
have of late been offering good advice to graduating 
classes, is the surest way to keep happy. Let us quote 
the speaker's words more exactly and more fully, and 
then proceed to write them upon the table of our heart. 
" I think," he says, " it would be an excellent idea to 
reverse the old proverb and say, ' Be happy and you '11 
be good.' And the surest way to keep happy is to be 
in touch with good literature. Always have some 
standard book near you. By devoting ten minutes 
each night to reading, I got through fourteen volumes 
of Parkman's history last year; and I can't tell you 
how much benefit I derived from it." Rapid reading 
that must have been, surely; but even the slow reader, 
like the tortoise, can reach the goal and sometimes win 
the prize.

THE DIAL 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The Bacon-Shakespeare cryptogramania long 
ago reached such a pitch of frenzy that its later mani- 
festations have ceased to surprise. But a new absurdity 
in this kind, that has appeared in a London newspaper 
from the pen of Mr. John Benson, merits a passing 
smile. That it is nothing but a clever burlesque is 
more than likely; yet one can imagine many an honest 
Baconian as taking the little skit for gospel truth — and 
small blame to him either, the whole controversy from 
beginning to end having so much the hue and complexion 
of an elaborate piece of solemn fooling. Mr. Benson 
professes to find, in the recent suggestion of Portland 
Place as the site of the proposed Shakespeare monument, 
a startling significance that has escaped gener'/" notice. 
" It is common knowledge," says he, " that tho lifelong 
desire of many eminent men has been to occupy a resi- 
dence in Portland Place. Such a desire has been frankly 
avowed in published autobiographies. Without any 
direct evidence such as I shall, with your permission, 
show to exist, we might surely suppose that Shakespeare 
was no exception to the rule, and that he also looked 
forward to a day when his fortune would allow him to 
rent an eligible mansion." Now for some of Mr. Benson's 
" direct evidence." " Let- any one possessing a know- 
le3ge of simple cryptogram take down his first folio of 
* Hamlet ' — if he is so unfortunate as not to possess one, 
he may repair to the nearest free library — and, with a 
strong magnifying glass, examine the lettering of the 
first thirty lines of the soliloquy, ' To be or not to be.' 
He will assuredly notice, as I, to my amazement, noticed 
even without a magnifier, that certain letters vary, very 
slightly, in form from the remainder. And in the lines 
in question he will discover that the peculiar letters, 
arranged consecutively, make up the striking line : <■ I 
would that I might live in Portland Place.' Thus we 
find in a passage which every man and woman of the 
least education has learned to lisp at the mother's knee 
the chief ambition of the dramatist's life." Confirma^ 
tory passages, not in cipher, are found in the same play; 
as in Act i.. Scene 4: "The very place puts toys of 
desperation, without more motive, into every brain ; " 
and, in Act iv., Scene 1 : " Bestow this place on us a 
little while." This excellent fooling has elicited from 
Professor Rolfe a pleasant rejoinder, declaring his in- 
ability to distinguish with certainty seriousness from 
mockery in the many astonishing " discoveries " made 
by the cryptogram-hunters, but closing with the per- 
tinent observation that Portland Place was, of course, 
unknown because non-existent in Shakespeare's day, this 
whole district of modern London being then far outside 
the city limits and almost uninhabited. 
• « ■ 
The purity of American speech has again received 
high praise from an eminent authority. Professor Alois 
Brandl, second to none in Germany on the subject of 
English literature and the English language, condemns 
the cockney accent that offends his ear in John Ball's 
island, and rates our American speech as no whit inferior 
(although he denies that he ever said it was superior) 
to the English of our cousins across the water. He 
even encourages us to hope that the dreadful Yankee 
"twang " will ere long be a memory and nothing more; 
he thinks it is disappearing, overcome and corrected by 
our system of public education. This German philologist 
has conversed with both English and American students 
in German universities, and has visited this country and 



listened to thirty-five of our public speakers, the most 
un-English of whom in pronunciation he found to be 
Mr. Andrew Carnegie, who is by birth neither American 
nor English, but Scotch. Dr. Brandl was consulted by 
the Prussian minister of education with reference to the 
proposed exchange of German and American college 
instructors ; and though the purity of American English 
was called in question by the consultant, the other's 
advice prevailed, and young Prussians are now to drink 
imstinted draughts from American wells of English 
undefiled. Another high authority, and an English- 
man too, is said to agree with the German professor on 
this disputed question. We refer to Professor Skeat, 
the occupant of the chair of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge, 
who is quoted as commending the instruction given in 
this coimtry in English literature and language, sub- 
jects that he finds too often neglected in the schools 
and universities of his own land. But all of this is sub- 
ject for interminable and seldom very profitable debate. 

On reading in bed many eulogies have been spoken 
and written, and also many wise and salutary and less 
eulogistic observations have been made. Robert Louis 
Stevenson and Edward FitzGerald and other men not 
so famous have enjoyed the reading of a good book in 
a good bed at a scandalously late hour of the night (or 
morning), and to all such partakers in this lazy luxury 
the words of a current medical journal will be welcome : 
" Certain people find that their worries accumulate in 
their brains after bedtime ; their nerves are at high ten- 
sion and their minds are actively at work trying to solve 
problems that should have been left behind in the city. 
Going to bed with the brain in such a state means that 
with nothing to distract the thoughts, hearing nothing 
and seeing nothing in the darkness, imagination has full 
sway, and hours of wakefulness may be the result. Such 
a man, we think, wUl find half an hour's reading in bed 
a great help. With careful attention paid to the quality 
and position of the light, so that without flickering it 
shines over the shoulder and directly on to the page, the 
much maligned habit of reading in bed has sometimes a 
very beneficial effect on a tired and overwakeful brain." 
So far so good; but your true bed-reader, your impas- 
sioned lector in lectulo, will never consent to close his book 
at the end of half an hour; he has just got well started 
and begun thoroughly to enjoy himself, the world for- 
getting, by the world forgot, in that brief space of time.

Duplicate fiction for hire, in public libraries, to 
meet the excessive demand for the very latest novels, 
was recently referred to by us, in terms of too little 
accuracy, as being still in its tentative stage. Librarian 
Lummis, of Los Angeles, in his latest annual report, 
speaks of this rental department as having originated 
at St. Louis " more than a decade ago," and he gives 
some interesting results of his own ten months' trial of 
the same system. The Los Angeles charge is five cents 
a week, with a five-cent fine for each day of detention 
afterward. " This collection," he writes, " started with 
467 volumes imder 74 titles. It now has 480 volumes 
under 100 titles. The system has been largely self- 
regulating as to the number of volumes of a popular 
novel to be bought. It has given for the first time 
adequate service to that considerable class of the public 
who desire to keep posted on current fiction. It has 
done this without working any injustice whatsoever to 
the other patrons of the library. In the ten and a half 
months since its installation, this duplicate list has cir- 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



culated over 20,000 issues and has received in cash 
$179.20 in fines and $831.80 in dues. Its net cost has 
been $598.09. Roughly speaking, it has paid for itself 
twice over." A further result, cheering or depressing 
according to the point of view, is duly recorded : the 
circulation of fiction, under the new system, has been 
increased by more than ten per cent in less than a year. 

• • • 

The museum as an adjunct to the library is of 
recent development, but its uses and possibilities are 
too manifest to need any demonstration on our part. 
Among other examples, we remember the public library 
at Methuen, Mass., as a most happy commingling of 
books and some of the things they tell about. The 
current issue of the " Wisconsin Library Bulletin," 
published by the Wisconsin Free Library Commission, 
contains among other articles of interest a contribution 
from Dr. Reuben Gold Thwaites, of the State Historical 
Society, on " Local Public Museums in Wisconsin." A 
picture of a New England kitchen in the State Historical 
Museum serves as an ocular proof of the value of right 
arrangement and grouping in the display of curiosities. 
We learn from Dr. Thwaites's article that "existing 
Wisconsin library laws make no specific provision for a 
museum in connection with the municipal library, as is 
the case in Great Britain. Nevertheless, at Oshkosh 
the public library has established within its building a 
most creditable museum, and there are small collections 
displayed in several other of the city libraries in the 
State." All honor to Oshkosh as a leader in this move- 
ment ! Following Dr. Thwaites's article are condensed 
reports from representative local museums in connection 
with Wisconsin public libraries.

The decadence of the old-time « leader " has 
been noted and regretted in London journalism. The 
scholarly, deliberately-written, authoritative editorial is 
giving place to the flashy, sensational, truth-distorting 
and prejudice-breeding news article, headed, more 
Americano, with gigantic capitals and printed with a 
" display " of anything but reticence and modesty. 
Writers of the first rank, men of wide information and 
mature judgment, are now seldom engaged as leader- 
writers for the London dailies, but all available resources 
go to increase the prominence and the popular influence 
and attractiveness of the heavily-headlined first page. 
Must we, lamenting this change, accept it as inevitable 
and sadly admit that the stately grace and the Uterary 
charm of a journalism that is dead will never come back 
to us ? . • > 

The minor morals of men of letters — that is, 
their manners in social intercourse — are by common 
consent regarded as less polished and urbane than might 
be desired. We seem to have here a curious meeting 
of extremes, the literate and illiterate displaying a 
certain boorishness in common, in some instances at 
least. Mr. Oscar Fay Adams, whose acquaintance 
with literary persons qualifies him to speak with some 
authority, has brought together in a newspaper article 
a few amusing examples of defective eoiu-tesy on the 
part of authors. A great writer and one less great were 
once thrown in company at a social function, when 
it occurred to the lesser celebrity that, as he had never 
been introduced to his more famous fellow-author, there 
could be no harm in introducing himself. " I believe, 

Mr. M ," said he, " that we have never met before." 

" No," was the frigid rejoinder, " we never have, and if 
I can have my wish in the matter we shall never meet 



again. Good morning, sir." With which the interview 
came to an abrupt close. At a meeting of antiquaries 
and other learned men it fell to the lot of Froude, as 
chairman, to present his implacable foe. Freeman, to 
the audience ; which he thus did in ominously honeyed 
tones : " It now gives me great pleasure to introduce to 
you one who, in his own presence, so well illustrates the 
savage customs of our remote ancestors." One can 
hardly believe this of the long-suffering and high- 
minded Froude; but the provocation was certainly 
great. In general, though surely not in the last exam- 
ple, is it not more often shyness than ill-nature that 
makes bookworms and dreamers less courteous of 
manner than society folk ? And in cases of positive 
rudeness, is it not often the fault of the literary person's 
nimbleness of wit, which makes the temptation to be 
cutting and sarcastic too strong to be resisted ? It is 
a subject for study and discussion, and Mr. Adams has 
by no means exhausted it. 

Songs of the opening summer have been much in 
evidence of late in the newspapers of the northern hemi- 
sphere. Has any reader of them, or any scornful 
skipper of them, stopped to think how minute a fraction 
of all the spring poetry written and submitted for pub- 
lication these sufficiently niunerous lays of the season 
constitute ? A notion of the excess of supply over 
demand might have been gained by the readers of a 
recent Sunday supplement to a Cleveland paper, which 
generously published an entire page of this volunteer 
verse, which we doubt not the proud authors were glad 
enough to see in print at no larger remuneration than 
$0.00 per nonpareil line. A contemporary takes occa- 
sion to hail with joy this editorial indulgence of budding 
poetic genius, and to remark that nothing has given 
it more solid satisfaction since the days of Georgia's 
premier poet, the late lamented J. Gordon Coogler, who 
gave to the world the matchless coupliet: 

" The books in the South are growing fewer — 
She never was much on literature." 
• • • 

Chaucer the man has made himself loved by many 
readers because he so simply and naturally reveals his 
human nature in his writings. A chance passage from 
Coleridge, reprinted in Mr. J. W. Mackail's newly- 
issued volume on " Coleridge's Literary Criticism," is 
suggestive : " I take imceasing delight in Chaucer. His 
manly cheerfulness is especially delicious to me in my 
old age. How exquisitely tender he is, and yet how 
perfectly free from the least touch of sickly melancholy 
or morbid drooping! The sympathy of the poet with 
the subjects of his poetry is particularly remarkable in 
Shakespeare and Chaucer; but what the first effects by 
a strong act of imagination and mental metamorphosis, 
the last does without any effort, merely by the inborn 
kindly joyousness of his nature. How well we seem to 
know Chaucer ! How absolutely nothing do we know 
of Shakespeare ! " Most of us would have put the 
last clause far less strongly, but the distinction is worth 
noting. . . . 

Coppee's felicitous choice of words and his 
dexterity in weaving them into a beautiful pattern con- 
stituted not the least of his merits as a literary artist. 
Now that he is taken from us, many will recall, even 
though they may have read but few of his writings, the 
grace and charm of his style, and the air of simple truth 
that hangs about his imaginative creations. " Unlike 
others," says a fellow-countryman of his in appraising 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



his work, " he was not led by pride or error to cut the 
bridges between himself and the multitude. Faithful 
to his antecedents, faithful to himself, he remained faith- 
ful to the crowd whom like memories and analogous cir- 
cumstances had shaped as they had shaped him. His 
genius did not separate him from the men of his time 
and his country; he sang their songs so well that they 
listened with an unfeigned sympathy. . . . Little clerks, 
little shopkeepers, little earners of little incomes, with 
only an occasional Sunday for pleasure, — these were 
the simple heroes of his epics. He knew them through 
and through ; he had an affectionate admiration for their 
patience, a sort of compassion for their predestined 
mediocrity." This is better praise than any commen- 
dation of his literary style, admirable though that style 
is recognized, even by the foreign reader, to have been. 

« The corrosive press " is a stronger and more 
vividly descriptive term than " yellow journalism "— 
partly because it is newer. If it is taken up and used, 
it will before long lose its biting quality ; but for the 
present let us give due credit to a London preacher, the 
Rev. Dr. Horton, who has so aptly used it in deploring 
the vicious tendencies of the present-day newspaper. 
Of course he, as well as we, would not forget the hon- 
orable exceptions. At a public meeting called together 
by him in his church at Hampstead, and unanimous in 
condemning " the corrosive press," Dr. Horton read an 
astounding proposal addressed by a certain newspaper 
editor to a distinguished minister of religion, inviting 
the latter to assist in commercially exploiting a young 
girl preacher of extraordinary " drawing " qualities, and 
offering him half the gate-money. Doubtless these bald 
terms were not used by the diplomatic editor, but the 
substance of the letter was, to put it mildly, an affront 
to the ministerial cloth. 

• • • 

Posthumous fame in literature butters no par- 
snips in the matter-of-fact present. This prosaic truth 
seems to have been recognized by a novelist still living 
and writing, in his ready reply to a talkative lady sitting 
next to him at dinner and boring him, we may imagine, 
with her prattle on the immortality of certain books 
whose authors have long been dead. The novelist was 
Mr. F. Marion Crawford, and when the lady at last 
asked him whether he had written anything that would 
live after he had gone, he made answer: " Madam, what 
I am trying to do is to write something that will enable 
me to live while I am here." Were not almost all the 
books that have achieved immortality written under an 
impulse astonishingly similar to that acknowledged by 
the author of " Mr. Isaacs " ? 
• • • 

The finest line of poetry, like the ten or the 
hundred best books, cannot be the same to all persons. 
In some recent newspaper discussion of the matter, the 
Wordsworthian line, " The light that never was on sea 
or land," has been cited as especially pleasing, and cer- 
tainly the frequency with which it is quoted proves it 
to be a favorite. For the perfect expression of the 
poet's thought, some of Gray's well-polished lines are 
excellent. Who can wake in these early summer morn- 
ings without finding himself listening to " the breezy 
call of incense-breathing morn " ? Or who, in his 
evening walks (this is written in the full of the June 
moon), can fail to recall Shakespeare's wonderful line, 
" How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank " ? 
In moments of unfulfilled longing, of sad-sweet melan- 



choly, how often there comes to mind that other 
wonderful line, " Absent thee from felicity awhile." 
And when the irony of life and the inexorableness of 
fate overcome us, what line better fits the mood than 
Emerson's mystic utterance, " When me they fly, I am 
the wings " ? Lowell's praise of this for its pregnancy 
of meaning is well known. There is no one finest line, 
and never can be ; so let us rejoice in the many finest 
lines quoted for our approval by the champions of the 
various great poets of all ages and all coimtries. 

Seafaring libraries may not be so many in number 
or so expertly selected and managed as the land-travel- 
ling kind that go thither and yon by rail and stagecoach, 
under the favoring auspices of the A. L. A. But the 
book-chests that sail the briny deep, stowed in the f oc'sle 
by some kind agent or patron of the Seamen's Friend 
Society, and beguiling the tedium of many an off-watch 
for the roving Jack Tar, number into the thousands; 
indeed, it is claimed that the records of the above-named 
society show that 25,742 such collections of books for 
sea service have been sent out since 1859, that 618,400 
volumes have been read by 442,230 sailors, while the 
United States navy has record of 39,415 books read by 
129,315 men in its pay and manning its ships. It is 
curious that with one exception — " Two Years Before 
the Mast " — the sea story of the bookstall and the 
public library is severely let alone by those whose life 
is on the ocean wave. Tales of land adventure and 
books of history and biography are studiously thumbed, 
as are also the novels of Dickens and the poems of 
Whittier. . • . 

An editio princeps of Mrs. Eddy's book, " Science 
and Health," was one of the items in the late auction 
sale, at New York, of the library of Mr. Edward H. 
Lowe, of London; and it brought the astonishing price 
of one hundred and fourteen dollars. At the same sale 
the first collected edition of Beaumont and Fletcher 
went for one hundred and two dollars. Mrs. Eddy's 
magnum opus was published, in its first edition, in 1875 ; 
Beaumont and Fletcher's collected writings, edited by 
James Shirley, were printed in London in 1647. For 
at least two centuries and a quarter the English- 
speaking world read and enjoyed Beaumont and 
Fletcher without the faintest premonition of the mar- 
vels to be revealed in " Science and Health, with a Key 
to the Scriptures." And now, even thus heavily handi-

The public library and municipal reform are 
not necessarily suggestive of each other to most minds ; 
but that the library can intelligently serve the cause of 
reform in city government has occurred to at least one 
librarian — Mr. Purd B. Wright, of the St. Joseph 
(Mo.) Public Library. In his Eighteenth Annual Re- 
port he says, among other interesting things: " Not a 
little attention has been given the collection of city 
charters in an effort to make the library of assistance 
in the matter of municipal legislation now before the 
people, and the collection includes the laws governing 
the progressive cities of the country." Bureaus of leg- 
islative reference are coming into being in various parts 
of the coimtry, the excellent one at Baltimore, which 
was noticed in some detail by us not long ago, being 
one of the foremost; and the establishment of such 
bureaus seems to fall well within the legitimate activ- 
ities of our larger public libraries.

The New Life of Herbert Spencer.* 

With the publication of the voluminous and 
exceedingly frank Autobiography of Herbert 
Spencer it might have been held that all the 
particulars concerning him which were of im- 
portance to posterity had been abundantly 
furnished. A smaller and more objective treat- 
ment of Spencer's life and works was subse- 
quently written by Professor J. A. Thomson — 
a work of value from every point of view, and 
certain to be read by multitudes who have 
neither the time nor the courage to attack the 
Autobiography. The announcement of a new 
" Life and Letters," in two rather large vol- 
umes, naturally raised the question whether 
really valuable new material could be found, to 
use up so much printer's ink. The answer to 
this question will no doubt differ according 
to the bias of the reader; but there will be 
many, in addition to the present reviewer, who 
are able to spend many hours over the book 
with equal pleasure and profit. Spencer him- 
self desired that the Autobiography should not 
be the sole authoritative source of information 
concerning his life, and inserted in his will a 
paragraph requesting Dr. David Duncan to 
prepare a biography " in one volume of mod- 
erate size." Dr. Duncan had been his secre- 
tary and assistant, and was in every way well 
qualified for the undertaking, which so' grew 
under his hand as to far exceed the moderate 
limits indicated by his instructions. The Auto- 
biography covers only sixty-two years of Herbert 
Spencer's life, so that the new work reaUy con- 
stitutes the only authoritative record of the re- 
maining twenty-one years. The matter relating 
to the earlier periods is designed to duplicate 
the AutobiogTaphy as little as possible, and by 
means of numerous original documents it sup- 
plements, and in some cases even corrects, the 
statements given in the earlier work. 

At the end of the second volume are two 
appendices, written by Spencer himself, but 
not previously published. The first is called 
" Physical Traits and Some Sequences "; the 
second, much longer and more important, " The 
Filiation of Ideas." The latter essay consists 
of a history and analysis of Spencer's intellectual 
development ; and, as he says in a prefatory 
note, may also " serve as a sketch plan of the

Synthetic Philosophy." It may be permissible 
to quote a number of illustrative sentences. 

" The events of childhood and boyhood, narrated 
elsewhere, indicate to how small an extent authority 
swayed me. The disobedience, so perpetually com- 
plained of, was the correlative of irreverence for gov- 
erning agencies. This natural trait operated throughout 
life, tending to make me pay little attention to the 
established opinion on any matter which came up for 
judgment, and tending to leave me perfectly free to 
inquire without restraint. . . . Another trait, not thus 
far named, and which I inherited from my father, was 
a dominant ideality, showing itself in a love of per- 
fection. In him this love was so strong that it became 
a hindrance. He could not let a thing alone as being 
finished. With me the desire to make work better, 
though pronounced, has not gone to that excess. . . . 
A general result of these natural traits and this kind 
of culture was an attitude of detachment. . . . But 
I must not forget another trait of nature, — a relative 
liking for thought in contrast with a relative aversion 
to action. . . . [In ' Social Statics '] there is no invoking 
of authorities. A few references, mostly dissentient, are 
made to ethical and political writers whose well-knowu 
doctrines I had gathered in the course of miscellaneous 
reading — not from their books; for I never could read 
books the cardinal principles of which I rejected. The 
course pursued in this case as in others was to go back 
to the facts as presented in human conduct and society, 
and draw inferences direct from them. . . . [From 
1852] onwards the evolutionary interpretation of things 
in general became habitual, and manifested itself in 
curious ways. One would not have expected to find it 
in an essay on ' The Philosophy of Style ' ; but at the 
close of that essay, written in 1852, the truth that 
progress in style is from uniformity to multiformity — 
from a more homogeneous to a more heterogeneous 
form — finds expression. . . . Up to [the time of read- 
ing Mill's Lofficl, thinking with me had been mainly 
concrete in character, but now it assumed an abstract 
character; and thereafter the abstract and the concrete 
went hand in hand, as the inductive and the deductive 
were already doing. . . . During a walk one fine Sun- 
day morning (or perhaps it may have been New Year's 
Day) in the Christmas of 1857-8, I happened to stand 
by the side of a pool along which a gentle breeze was 
bringing small waves to the shore at my feet. While 
watching these undulations I was led to think of other 
undulations — other rhythms ; and probably, as my man- 
ner was, remembered extreme cases — the imdulations 
of the ether, and the rises and falls in the prices of 
money, shares, and commodities. In the course of the 
walk arose the inquiry — Is not the rhythm of motion 
imiversal? and the answer soon reached was — Yes." 

The incident of the pool illustrates a trait of 
Spencer's which has been misunderstood in some 
quarters. Because he made very few original 
observations in science, and was not in the 
ordinary sense a scientific investigator, there 
has been a tendency to class him with the com- 
pilers rather than with the researchers. This 
tendency is likely to increase, for the reason 
that aU can perceive his immense accumidation 
of evidence, while few are willing and able to 
follow the operations of his mind. Many of

his conclusions are now so generally diffused as 
to have become commonplace, leading to criti- 
cism resembling that of the man who complained 
that Shakespeare's plays were so largely made 
up of familiar quotations. On the other hand, 
his mistakes stand out as more uniquely his, 
while his failings become material for gossip, 
the net result being an appreciable injustice. 
In any attempt to estimate Spencer's position 
in the history of thought, it must be remem- 
bered that in the nineteenth century there 
existed an opportunity which was in many 
ways unique. The hold of ancient dogma was 
loosing, and the idea of evolution was slowly 
coming to the front. Academic philosophers 
(as even to this day) were bound to ancient 
traditions and were unable to frame a scheme 
of things in harmony with the results of modern 
science. Scientific men were too busy with 
their own special researches to engage in any- 
thing which might be termed philosophy. 
Clearly, there was needed a man of great ability 
and industry, who should regard all known 
phenomena as materials for building up a mod- 
ern and harmonious, system of thought. Such a 
man, however, must have also great independ- 
ence ; he must treat his materials in a strictly 
scientific manner, exactly as the ordinary inves- 
tigator does, or tries to do, with the smaller 
details within his scope. Herbert Spencer had 
all these qualifications, and hence was able 
to render an extraordinary service. On the 
other hand, every part of his work necessarily 
reflects the state of knowledge existing in his 
day, and in consequence the portions which will 
have permanent value, other than historic, are 
no doubt comparatively fcAv. 

In Spencer's earlier days higher education 
was not nearly so general as it now is, and no 
doubt a considerable measure of his peculiar 
efficiency might have been destroyed by a reg- 
ular academic course. A world full of men as 
independent as Spencer would probably be a 
difficult place to live in ; but it is certainly true 
that from time to time there is urgent need for 
just such men. It is a somewhat alarming 
thought, that the Universities may eventually 
succeed (as the Church did in former ages) in 
enlisting practically aU the best budding intel- 
lect of the times, and depriving it of the high- 
est measure of originality by processes which 
may be perhaps wholly advantageous to the 
average individual. Danger of this sort is 
inherent in all extensive forms of organization, 
and while recognizing the advantages of the 
great institutions we should not lose sight of the 



fact that a price is paid for the gain — just as 
William Morris used to say about machine- 
made goods. 

The modern drift toward collectivism is wel- 
comed by the present writer. Science itself 
shows that a system of world-wide cooperation, 
without irksome tyranny, is perfectly possible. 
Nevertheless, Herbert Spencer's stand for in- 
dividualism, softened and modified by the haze 
of later experiences, will always possess a high 
value as representing at least one important 
aspect of things. 

" Spencer, indeed, in his late years sadly took note 
of movements apparently in contradiction to the leading 
principles of his doctrines ; and here I may recall a con- 
versation within a week of his death between him and a 
friend * who had once been wholly with him, but had 
latterly leant to Collectivist action. ' We have been 
separated,' said Spencer, ' but if we have been moving 
along different lines, I know we have both been moving 
to the same end.' ' Yes,' she replied — it was a woman 
who showed that divergence of opinion could not detach 
her from offices of tenderness and of love — ' and it may 
be that in time some other method of attacking the great 
problem will be adopted, which will be neither wholly 
yours nor wholly ours.' ' Yes, it may be,' said Spencer, 
thus revealing in the last week of his life a mind open 
to receive new suggestions and to accept new proposals 
of change." (Vol. 2, p. 233.)

A Study of a Great ILiITerarx Period.* 



The great thought of an age may be absorbed 
into the thought of the ages that follow ; a great 
form can never be so absorbed. You may come 
upon the thought again and again, in new shapes 
and applications ; to appreciate the great form, 
you must go back to its period and take it practi- 
cally as it was given to the world. Aristotle, for 
instance, appears and reappears in philosophy 
for two thousand years ; while -lEschylus, broadly 
speaking, is to be had only in Greek drama. If 
the form is worth studying and enjoying — and 
every great form is — it must be taken in rela- 
tion to the time that produces it. 

Our own noblest literary heritage, the drama 
of the age of Elizabeth, is coming back into 
significance again, and the race from which 
came the greatest concerted utterance of all 
literature seems almost ready to give that utter- 
ance a true second hearing. It is going to be

eminently worth our while to listen, for the 
epoch provides an almost inexhaustible store of 
wholesome enjoyment, and a knowledge of its 
form will be of very great benefit to a time — 
our own — that is about to witness a revival of 
drama that will be literary, not in the sense of 
being bookish, but in the sense of being artistic 
and real. Whatever serves, then, to bring us 
closer to Elizabethan drama is welcome, and 
doubly welcome, if it is comprehensive and 
illuminating, showing the subject in many clear 
lights. Doubly welcome, therefore, is Professor 
ScheUing's magnum opus in this field. 

The book is the result of long, careful, and 
sympathetic study. Marked literary feeling, 
catholicity of taste, and, best of all, a true sense 
of perspective (whose absence is the first infirm- 
ity of scholarly minds), are among the author's 
endowments. There are limitations in the work, 
some obvious, some not immediately apparent ; 
but no work covering so large a field can be 
without its limitations, and no work that essays 
to cover this particular field has so few. In 
view of much painstaking yet often near-sighted 
German investigation of this period, it is in no 
small degree provocative of national pride to 
realize that we have here a well-proportioned 
American book that may rightly rank with 
Mr. Chambers's " Mediaeval Stage," and serve 
as a continuation of that admirable achievement. 
Professor ScheUing's book is written to stand 
the test of scholarship ; and although many of 
the special opinions expressed in the twelve 
hundred pages will doubtless receive correction 
in the future, the book will bear the general test. 

Professor Schelling very clearly marks out 
the boundaries of his task. This is a history 
of Elizabethan drama, — a wider subject than 
Elizabethan dramatic literature, and a much 
wider one than Elizabethan dramatic poetry, the 
author rightly holding that a study of master- 
pieces only is bound to break down as an explan- 
ation of a great period. This great period, 
roughly denominated Elizabethan, includes, in 
the author's usage, more than the precise years 
of Elizabeth's reign, and, beginning nominally 
with her accession in 1558 (in reality we are 
given also a fairly complete sketch of the develop- 
ment of the miracles, moralities, and interludes), 
continues to the suppression of the theatres two 
score of years after the great queen's death. 
Whatever objections there may be to the name 
Elizabethan for the period, there can be no 
objection to the inclusion of practically a cen- 
tury as the proper historical epoch to deal with. 
On the other hand, having stated as his theme 



the history of the whole dramatic production of 
the given time, the author excludes from his 
work purely aesthetic and technical considera- 
tions of dramatic form, the tracing of sources, 
specifically theatrical history, and biographical 
matter, save when these various things are in- 
volved in the general theme. 

The properly elaborate table of contents shows 
the character of the book. It is made up of 
chapters on subjects like these : Early Dramas 
of School and Court, the New Romantic Drama, 
National Historical Drama, Domestic Drama, 
Romantic Comedy, Comedy of Humors, Roman- 
tic Tragedy, Classical Myth and Story, the 
Masque, the Pastoral, Decadent Romance. In 
other words, the entire subject is parcelled out 
into its natural divisions, and each one of these 
divisions is fully treated by itself, each species 
being carried from its beginning to its conclu- 
sion. Inasmuch as the work is primarily a 
study of a great type, and but secondarily a 
study of authors, the authors themselves are not 
treated separately. They do not lose by it ; on 
the contrary, their actual merits are more appar- 
ent when seen comparatively. So, too, of course, 
are their defects ; but a period is before us where 
the men are large enough to risk having their 
defects brought into the field, providing their 
virtues are made equally obvious. 

It may make some readers open their eyes 
not to find a single chapter devoted to Shake- 
speare, and yet this book will give its readers a 
better notion of Shakespeare than almost any 
volume that can be named. For if the master 
playwright does not preempt a single chapter, 
he enters into many chapters, and we see his 
work not as an isolated phenomenon but as an 
organic part of a great whole. As each phase 
of the whole epoch is discussed, the relation of 
each individual playwright to that phase is made 
clear, and thus varied activity and special pre- 
eminence receive their actual due, other drama- 
tists as well as Shakespeare standing out from 
the rank and file of the average, save that 
Shakespeare is thus demonstrably more versatile, 
obviously more outstanding. 

There is no feature of the book that is better 
than this admirable planning ; for while treat- 
ing the whole of a given author at one time 
undeniably gives us a more unified notion of 
that author as an individual, the present way 
gives much the best idea of period and workman 
in their actual relationship. Imagine the history 
of a great political movement told by a series of 
outlines of the complete work of each statesman 
who was a factor, and then in contrast imagine

the same movement treated as an organic de- 
velopment, stage by stage, with each partici- 
pant's share clearly indicated in its proper place. 
The difference between the wrong way and the 
right way, historically, is no greater than the 
difference between the old way and our present 
author's way. As is the case with many another 
valid plan, one of the wonders is that no one 
should have hit on it before. 

The author's style is direct and simple ; his 
criticism is definite instead of metaphorical. 
The latter virtue is worthy of special praise, for 
the Elizabethan writers seem particularly to 
tempt their sympathetic critics to more or less 
vivid figures of speech in lieu of accurate state- 
ment. There is a place, of course, for such 
figurative criticism ; but the place, broadly 
speaking, is in volumes of poetry. Swinburne's 
striking sonnets on Elizabethan dramatists, for 
instance, successfully say nearly all that is 
needed in that kind. The absence of superflu- 
ous metaphor in Professor Schelling's prose will 
not mean to a discerning reader absence of live- 
liness ; there is much quiet humor, unobtru- 
sively put, — as when the all-sufficient comment 
is made on John Stock wood that in 1678 he 
inveighed against certain theatres, " thus giving 
us an early mention of those playhouses." Fur- 
ther, if our author eschews sentimentality, he 
does not feel in scholarship bound to repress real 
feeling. The underlying temper of his criticism 
appears in a remark on Shakespeare's dominant 
interest in character rather than in structure : 

" How trivial seem our paltry labelings : Cymheline, 
1609, a belated specimen of the chronicle history in 
which a romantic story of Italian origin usurps an 
undue share of a plot otherwise of English pseudo- 
historical original ! Wholly negligible seem these little 
pickings of small scholarship in view of the single, 
wholesome, dominating influence of that exquisite pic- 
ture of truest and sweetest womanhood, Imogen." 

Note, however, that this is said by a man who 
has mastered details ; not by one who has scorned 
the little pickings without being acquainted 
with them. Yet it must be freely admitted 
that much indulgence even in real sentiment 
would be dangerous ; for instance, the author 
has certainly left safe ground when he speaks 
of transubstantiation as " a dramatic motive of 
the utmost tragic efficacy "; when in an utterly 
different field he appraises Jonson's comedy 
by a too narrowly aesthetic standard ; and when 
in an obiter dictum he speaks of modem drama 
as losing itself "in the thirsty realistic sands 
of Ibsen." 

The necessary limits of a general review pre- 
clude reference to more than a few of the 



several score of passages marked for favorable 
comment, and the dozen or so noted for sharp 
objection. It is good to find Professor Schelling 
frankly accepting the term " miracle " instead 
of " mystery " (a pedantry in English), reject- 
ing definitely the " alternation theory " of 
Elizabethan staging, and refusing to be led 
into the intricacies of attempted solution of col- 
laboration in dramatic authorship. For objec- 
tions, one will serve : in commenting on 
Webster's " Duchess of Malfy," Professor 
Schelling notes that the discovery, by a recent 
American scholar, of a reference to Concini, 
1617, dates the play " once for all " (a term, 
by the way, that is used too frequently and too 
hastily in the book). The supposed allusion 
was pointed out twelve years ago by an English 
scholar, Mr. C Vaughan. But even if correct, 
a single reference, which might easily have 
been interpolated at a revival of the play, cannot 
possibly date a whole play whose tone otherwise 
indicates a date prior to Concini's death. 

Of unusual value are the splendidly copious 
Bibliographical Essay, and the practically ex- 
haustive list of plays written, acted, or published 
between 1558 and 1642. This list, however, 
could be made more useful by having a page 
cross-reference to the bibliography, which is 
arranged by species and calls for a thumbing 
over of a number of pages before the play 
within the species is found. The book is an 
important one, — a notable contribution to 
American scholarship. But it is a book for 
the intelligent layman as well as for the scholar, 
and its reader will be spurred on to wider 
reading in one of the most fascinating fields of 
literature. Martin W. Sampson. 



The PsYCHOiiOGY or Government.* 

Mr. Bentley, the author of this "Study in 
Social Pressures " which he calls " The Process 
of Government," explains in the first part of 
his book that it is intended as a protest against 
attempts to explain social phenomena by treat- 
ing them as the results of prevalent " feelings " 
or " ideas," so as to imply a " soul-stuff " as 
the underlying cause. This part of the book is 
practically devoted to the contention that by 
falling victims to this " soul-stuff " error a large 
number of most eminent writers have reduced 
portions of their work to absurdity. 

Mr. Bentley is right in saying, as sociologists

sures. By Arthur F. Bentley. The University of Chicago Press.

[July 1, 



have said before, that prevalent " feelings " and 
" ideas " are not entities apart from the social 
reality, causing it to be what it is, but are the 
very essence of that reality. Yet he is wrong 
whenever he denies that particular prevalent 
feelings and ideas have causal significance in 
explaining the social reality, for that is to deny 
that social activities condition each other. We 
must indeed see that every given " feeling " is an 
activity in which there is more or less idea, and 
every prevalent "idea" an activity in which there 
is more or less feeling. It is by a kind of meton- 
ymy that we call any prevalent activity a " feel- 
ing " or an " idea," naming it by its most promi- 
nent feature. It is true that no single phase or 
feature of social activity should be made the 
mother of the social realities. The biologically 
derived capacities of men, and the environing 
physical nature and human activities, are all 
causal conditions, and terms in social explana- 
tion. Interest or attention is a name for the 
fact of fruitful union between capacity and en- 
vironment. There is good ground for protest 
against the common resort to interests and 
motives as the " social forces." Such a protest 
was earlier made by the present reviewer, who 
has insisted that the sociologist has no more need 
for any " social force," in addition to the ohserv- 
ahle factors in causation, than the biologist has 
for a vital force. Mr. Bentley is right in saying 
that scientific explanation should not rest on any 
implication of a causal " soul-stuff " assumed to 
underlie the activities observed. By his revul- 
sion against the " soul-stuff " assumption he is 
made to go too far toward identifying social 
activity with overt muscle-motion, whUe slight- 
ing activity as it is inferred to exist for con- 
sciousness ; and the condemnation which he 
heaps upon other writers is based upon quota- 
tions, at least a part of which had for their 
authors, and naturally convey to their readers, 
a meaning to which his objections do not apply. 
The second part of the book is more exten- 
sive, more readable, and more useftd than the 
introductory criticisms. In making the transi- 
tion to the second part, Mr. Bentley says that 
our political science is description which does 
not reach the stage of explanation ; that at- 
tempts at political philosophy have been specu- 
lative rather than scientific ; and that scientific 
explanation, when it comes, will have to be 
worked out in terms of the conflicting interests 
of manifold relatively small groups. He quotes 
a German work on political science which says 
that such explanation is a problem of Sociology, 
and he evidently holds that Politics as a special 



social science must avail itself of the principles 
and methods of general sociology . The " in ter est- 
group "interpretation of political activity is com- 
mon property among Sociologists. Yet while 
Mr. Bentley disclaims originality, his discussion 
and illustration of the doctrine is not devoid of 
that enviable quality. 

He is as willing to depart from a merely 
common-sense view as those who first argued 
that the earth is round ; and it may be that 
some of the useful modes of thought which he 
advocates will be slow in gaining acceptance for 
reasons not wholly unlike those that delayed 
acceptance of the doctrine of the earth's rotun- 
dity. The second portion of his book should not 
be ignored by those who wish to keep abreast 
of modern thought on politics and government. 
Its main teaching is, roughly stated, that govern- 
ment is an activity of society as a whole, in 
which every practical interest that is shared by 
a number of people who are able in any way 
whatever to make their will effective upon their 
fellows is, according to the measure of this effect, 
a governing agency ; and that the process of 
government can be understood, not by study of 
constitutions, platforms, and other professedly 
political documents and activities, but only by 
analyzing the great complex whole, and then 
recombining it, in thought, as a synthesis of 
these group pressures.

A British Diplomat's Recollections.* 



In his septuagenarian retirement from public 
service. Sir Henry Drummond Wolff has in- 
dulged the inclination natural to his time of life 
to review the past and live over again in anec- 
dotic reminiscence the experiences of his more 
active years. In two volumes of " Rambling 
Recollections," as they are entitled, and which, 
he informs his readers at the outset, are " not 
an autobiography, nor even a continuous narra- 
tive," and which are " founded on no diary or 
record," the ex-diplomat puts down, just as they 
come unbidden to his memory — and it proves 
to be a remarkably tenacious one — stories of 
persons and places and events that he has had 
to do with in his more than half a century of 
service as a government official. To teU what 
noted persons of his day he has not met and 
has not brought into his book would be much

easier and shorter than to enumerate the celeb- 
rities he has thus become acquainted with and 
helped his readers to know more intimately. 
Fifty-four pages of index, mostly of personal 
names, follow the narrative and indicate in a 
striking way its anecdotic, even gossipy, nature. 

" I consider nothing in my recollection irrel- 
evant," writes the author in recording one of his 
hundreds of anecdotes of persons ; and he ram- 
bles on (to use the verb of his own choice) much 
as one might in familiar conversation after dinner. 
In fact, not a little of his matter will to many 
seem too trivial for print ; but it entertains, and 
it also excites wonder at the writer's readiness 
in recalling so many and so varied occurrences 
after such a lapse of time. The division of the 
book into chapters, seventy in number, serves as 
a convenient chopping into attractive bits what 
might otherwise discourage the hardiest reader to 
undertake. Simply as a collection of miscella- 
neous anecdotes, the matter logically falls into 
no such sections, although it does try to follow 
some chronological order. 

Leaving Rugby to enter the Foreign Office 
at sixteen years of age, Sir Henry was in the 
diplomatic service at many posts, — in Florence, 
the Ionian Islands, Bulgaria, Turkey, Egypt, 
Persia, Roumania, and finally as British Ambas- 
sador at Madrid, whence he returned to private 
life eight years ago. The stories and jokes that 
enliven Sir Henry's pages are strung together on 
so slender a thread that it will be permissible to 
quote a few of them here with no more system 
than is observed in their compilation. An amus- 
ing hit at the English tuft-hunter is innocently 
administered in the following anecdote : 

" At a time when I was frequenting the Athenaeum 
a good deal, a Cingalese gentleman, who had come to 
England to read for the bar, was recommended by Sir 
Roderick Murchison to all his acquaintances. One day, 
finding him dining alone, Mr. Hay ward and I invited 
him to our table. Mr. Hayward wished to instruct him 
as to the constitution of English society, and said, ' You 
will find in England that men of distinction, who belong 
neither to the aristocracy nor to the richer classes, but 
have made a mark, either in literature or by their con- 
versational powers, are always received in great houses 
on a footing of perfect equality. You never go to a 
great house but you will see some distinguished literary 
man received as one of the most highly honom-ed guests.' 
The Cingalese said, very naively, ' But are these not 
called sycophants ? ' There was complete silence." 

A reminiscence of John Delane, of " The 
Times," with an incidental witticism from the 
alert Mr. Lowe, catches the eye not inoppor- 
tunely. 

« During the time I was in the Foreign Office, I nat- 
urally made a great many acquaintances, many of whom 
I have already mentioned; but there were some who 



became my friends as I went on in experience, and 
whom I shall always recollect. Mr. John Delane, the 
editor of the Times, was exceedingly kind to me. 1 
was introduced to him by Sir John Burgoyne. He had 
a homelike, old-fashioned, panelled house — 16 Ser- 
jeants' Inn. Here he used to give most agreeable 
dinners, and there came Mr. Bernal Osborne, Mr. 
Lowe, and the most amusing people in London. On 
one occasion we were talking of a member of the 
Government supposed to be a great failure. Some one 
said, 'They want to make him a peer.' Mr. Lowe 
retorted, • No, they want to make him disappear.' " 

The change and expansion that the Foreign 
Office has undergone since the author's entrance 
there as " additional clerk " in 1846 is signifi- 
cant. In his day, he tells us, there was on the 
ordinary staff one permanent Under-Secretary 
of State, and also one political, whereas now 
there are three assistant Under-Secretaries in 
addition to these. Two Legal Advisers are 
now appointed to the Foreign Office ; in Sir 
Henry's time there was none. Twenty-eight 
clerks in the diplomatic establishment, of whom 
seven were Heads of Departments, have in- 
creased to forty-four, eight of whom are Heads 
of Departments. The Financial Department 
has been correspondingly enlarged, also the 
Librarian's Department, and, in short, " the 
force of the Foreign Office has been augmented 
to an enormous extent." That the earlier and 
far smaller force of clerks was at times sadly 
overworked appears from the narrative. 

It must not be inferred that the book is 
wholly devoted to personal anecdotes. Political 
topics are discussed, but as the discussions often 
concern dead issues, or matters of interest 
chiefly to English statesmen, the present review 
will not concern itself with them. As the 
author, in addition to his diplomatic service 
abroad, was also in Parliament for some years 
(from 1874 to 1880, and again from 1880 to 
1885), parliamentary questions as well as par- 
liamentarians furnish matter for his pages. He 
remarks on the almost invariable absence of 
personal animosity between the bitterest politi- 
cal foes. " One of the greatest examples of 
this," he continues, "was the late Lord Lans- 
downe, who, though a strong politician, never 
allowed party feeling to actuate private actions. 
I recoUect hearing him say to one of his guests 
that he was very anxious about Lord Derby, 
who was ill, as he was one of his oldest friends." 
Of the ever-delightful Labouchdre he says that 
he was the wittiest man in the House of Com- 
mons, and that, though at times he was politi- 
cally unpopular, all who knew him felt a strong 
friendship for him. His wit, clever but some- 
times over-elaborate, was always good-natured.

THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



From the time of the Berlin Congress there 
comes down an excellent Bismarck anecdote. 
The Chancellor had one day received Lord Odo 
Russell, the English Ambassador, and was 
chatting with him familiarly and at some length, 
when the visitor took occasion to ask his host 
whether he was not often annoyed by having his 
callers prolong their interviews miduly. Bis- 
marck replied that he had a private arrangement 
with his wife whereby she took care to send for 
him on some pretext whenever it appeared that 
his hospitality was being abused. Just then a 
servant entered and told the Prince, from the 
Princess, that it was time for him to take his 
medicine. 

As the author was in Spain, in the capacity of 
British Ambassador, at the time of the Spanish- 
American War, it is interesting to note his com- 
ment on that event. 

"The difficulties caused by the disagreement with 
America were incalculable. The United States declared 
— and their subsequent conduct verified their declara- 
tion — that they did not seek to annex Cuba, which an 
American gentleman described to me as 'the richest 
slice of earth,' nor to establish a Protectorate over the 
island. The first alternative, they considered, would 
disturb the voting balance of the United States, and 
the latter would entail endless care and responsibility. 
The Americans were desirous that Spain should settle 
the war in a manner just and honourable to herself, 
while securing to Cuba peace and prosperity. . . . 

"In Spain, unfortunately, the acceptance of party 
office often paralyses Ministerial energy, and even with 
an army of 130,000 men, and an expenditure of a million 
a month, but Uttle progress was made in crushing out 
the insurrection by force. These difficulties were en- 
hanced by financial straits and by the interference of the 
United States Legislature. The obvious solution of the 
difficulty was the concession of liberties sufficient to 
satisfy the Cuban people. This, as has been said, was 
the aim of the United States Government; but the 
Spanish Government dreaded any spontaneous action. . . 

" Spain's difficulties were great. The fact that, 
notwithstanding the loss of her colonies, the present 
dynasty remains unshaken is entirely due to the Queen 
Regent, who struggled almost unaided at this trying 
crisis. When we left Spain, the feeling of loyalty 
towards her Majesty was very much on the increase. 
That loyalty has been extended to her son. Perhaps 
Spain may prosper, as England prospered notwith- 
standing the loss of America." 

The author's friendly feeling for America 
becomes again apparent in his preface, which 
we take to be his closing word to the reader. 
He says of his book : " There are many points 
omitted. I have not even alluded to the great 
change in English society caused by the influx 
of American notables. I believe that this pecu- 
liar feature of recent years is likely to bring 
great improvement and advantage to both 
countries." He then names some still-living 



Americans whose acquaintance has brought 
him especial pleasure. 

The mechanical execution of these two ample 
volumes, with their large print in Scotch-face 
type, and their interesting portraits and other 
illustrations, is all that could be desired. Errors 
of typography or of proof-reading are welcomely 
absent, although one of the author's stories — 
concerning the remarkable detection of an 
assassin by means of his handwriting — is 
marred by the misspelling of the French terra 
graphologie^ which appears as graphiologie. 
Whatever criticism the author may have sub- 
jected himself to — and he frankly says, "I am 
prepared to accept criticism without remon- 
strance " — he will not be censured as having 
taxed his readers' attention in a manner unbe- 
fitting this season of rest and recreation.

thereafter, take courage from Professor Louns- 
bury's collected essays on "The Standard of Usage 
in English" (Harper), and especially from the 
second chapter, entitled " Is English Becoming 
Corrupt ? " It will be found from the author's 
researches that the lament over an imagined deprav- 
ity of disposition displayed by current speech is 
almost as old as speech itself, and that the really 
alarming symptom would be a halt in this alleged 
downward course of language ; for that would mean 
that the language was dead, or rather that its users 
were dead, intellectually at least. The whole book 
emphasizes the truth — which not even the pedant 
and the purist would dispute in so many words, but 
which it is well to have brought freshly home to us 
now and then — that language was made for man, 
not man for language. Usage, and not grammar 
or logic or reason, is the authority to which all, even 
the crabbedest of grammarians, consciously or un- 
consciously bow. But it is the usage of the best 
writers and speakers, and to some extent it is 
present rather than past usage. While the author 
makes all this clear, he says not a word on the 
interesting question that must occur to many read- 
ers, What rule is there for deciding who are the 
best writers and speakers, especially among the 
living ? The assaults, vigorous and effective, made 
by Professor Lounsbury on many pet prejudices — 
as, for instance, on the prejudice against the split 
infinitive, and that against " none " as a plural 
pronoun — may scandalize the purists ; but with the 
history of the language at his command the assailant

is a doughty foeman to repulse. A careful reading 
of the book ought to instil into even the most 
pragmatic and dogmatic of self-appointed language- 
menders a shyness in venturing upon verbal criti- 
cism. After learning that the unprepossessing 
form " illy " is found in such respectable writers as 
Fielding, Southey, and Washington Irving, one 
becomes reticent of even deliberate censure, far 
more of " snap " judgments. A little disappointing 
is the author's unconcern as to the ultimate fate of 
" shall " and " wiU," " should " and " would." Let 
usage determine ; he remains a calm looker-on. Of 
course usage will determine ; and that means that 
what was once a clearly defined and useful distinc- 
tion will soon be obliterated, and the language wUl 
be so much the poorer. Again, one is a little sur- 
prised to find so careful a writer using " individuals " 
in the sense of " persons," where no contradistinction 
from collective humanity is intended. A dash of 
humor, with occasionally a bite of sarcasm, gives 
flavor and relish to Professor Lounsbury's pages. 
The book is excellent reading as well as sound doc- 
trine. Considerable additions have been made to 
the several chapters since their original appearance 
in " Harper's Magazine." 

The relations ^ ^^lunae bearing the impress of 
of medicine the official book of the " Emmanuel 

and religion. movement" at once has a definite 
purpose and appeal. In the background of the 
historical consciousness is the feeling that originally 
the priest and physician were one ; and the query 
has been newly raised. Which one? In kinship 
with this feeling, or belief, is the renewed convic- 
tion that the Church must be practical, and be all 
things to all men. The modern interpretation of 
this doctrine finds a specific embodiment in the 
several new faiths that bring into the focus of their 
creed the practice of healing. The *' Emmanuel 
movement " is the expression of a desire to be help- 
ful to human frailty without incurring an adherence 
to extreme theories and a complete abandonment of 
religious affiliation. On the theoretical side, each 
person interested is likely to adjust his faith and 
his science in accordance with his predilections. On 
the practical side, the movement is significant be- 
cause it is rational. Dr. Worcester and his asso- 
ciates accept no cases without the diagnosis of a 
competent specialist, and suggest no treatment 
except as approved by such medical authority. They 
indulge in no self-deceptive " demonstrations " that 
the obvious does not exist. They recognize that 
science alone can determine disease and give the 
rational basis for its treatment. But equally they 
recognize that there is usually, and in nervous dis- 
eases always, a large psychical factor, and that this 
psychical factor is amenable to the modes of minis- 
tration that the Church is ready to assume. Men, 
after all, are more largely regulated by their emo- 
tions than by their intellect ; the emotions con- 
cerned are accessible only to appeal through human 
sympathy and moral support of a type that the 



worthy and helpful minister frequently can offer. 
That certain churchmen will have legitimate doubts 
as to whether or not this is the proper work for the 
Church, and certain physicians will have as strong 
doubts as to whether the whole of the treatment 
should not be left to their own body, is inevitable. 
For the present, the experience is such as to sug- 
gest a distinctly successftJ field for these endeavors. 
The volume on ''Religion and Medicine" by Dr. 
Worcester and Dr. McComb from the religious side, 
and by Dr. Coriat from the medical side, serves in 
some measure as a declaration of principles. The 
several contributors do not really agree, nor can the 
exposition be said to be particularly helpful to those 
acquainted with the current views as to psychic 
treatment. Dr. Worcester's insistence upon an in- 
dependent and mystic subconscious mind is unfor- 
tunate, and does not strengthen the practical side 
of the volume. But it will serve a timely and 
useful purpose, and for that it should be welcomed.

The Oriental With the present predominance of 

tale and its /? -• • lA. a. -^ • ^ 

influence in nction in literature, it IS not surpris- 

England. ing that the scholastic and academic 

mind should have been unable to resist the attrac- 
tion. Perhaps it may seem to the uninitiated much 
more easy and pleasant to read a novel by way of 
work than to delve in crabbed treatises, dreary old 
histories, or interminable epics. People who think 
so may well try the experiment. However this may 
be, there are now a number of dissertations, treatises, 
and books on topics under the head of Fiction, and 
among them is Dr. Martha P. Conant's "The 
Oriental Tale in England in the Eighteenth Cen- 
tury " ( Columbia University Press ) . The students of 
fiction have a good deal of interest in the eighteenth- 
century tale as a predecessor of the short story so 
prevalent in the nineteenth century. Dr. Conant, 
however, though she does touch the question of form, 
is in this monograph chiefly concerned with the 
subject-matter. She traces the growing interest in 
Eastern stories in Western Europe, touching even 
on the earliest times, but making her real beginning 
with the first English version of the " Arabian 
Nights." It is certainly a curious story. The pos- 
sibilities and impossibilities of the East had their 
charm for a moralist like Johnson, an essayist like 
Addison, a man of the world like Beckford, or even 
for a poet like Collins. " Arabian Nights," Persian 
Tales, Turkish, Chinese, Mogul Tales, — all kinds 
of tales, if from the East, — became popular. Dr. 
Conant's book gives an account of the material under 
the four heads of Imaginative, Moralistic, Philo- 
sophic, and Satiric Tales ; and there is a final chapter 
which summarizes the matter and brings them into 
connection with other ideas and currents of opinion. 
There are added some notes, a list of about a hun- 
dred important Oriental tales, a list of the literature 
of the subject, and an Index which, as far as we have 
experimented with it, is quite correct. We will note 
but two questions concerning Dr. Conant's conclu-

sions : Is the " Arabian Nights " the " godmother of 
the modern novel " ? (p. 243). We do not think so ; 
it may suggest the story but hardly the plot. Is the 
Oriental tale per se of Romantic interest (p. 246), 
and if so what is its romanticism ? Here we think 
Dr. Conant makes a better point. But to discuss 
even these questions would take an extended article : 
we ask them now only to arouse the interest of those 
(and they are many) who will like to read the book. 

8 vectsof ^^^ reader who nears the end of 

George Meredith. Mr. Richard H. P. Curle's " Aspects 
novelist and poet, ^f George Meredith " (Button) with 
the feeling that for want of a vigorous central idea 
the work lacks force, comes upon a confession which 
takes the wind from his critical sails. For Mr. Curie 
unpretentiously says in his last chapter that it is in- 
deed probable that he has not even understood much 
of what Mr. Meredith teaches, and that he has tried 
to do no more than write about some of those features 
which have struck him as of exceptional interest. 
These various " aspects " of Mr. Meredith are here 
considered ; he is described as a poet and a " novel- 
ist of types," steering the middle course between 
idealism and realism ; his characteristics are dis- 
cussed from the view-points of his personality, his 
attitude toward nature, his conceptions of social prob- 
lems, his handling of character and diverse phases 
of humanity, his sense of comedy, his wit and humor, 
and his eloquence. This method of classification, 
somewhat necessary in critical writing, when carried 
to excess becomes artificial ; and Mr. Curie's care- 
ful nuances of definition at times weary the reader 
without pleasurably enlightening him. His inter- 
pretation of Mr. Meredith in general, however, is 
appreciative and illuminating, conscious as he is 
of the great writer's " true and consistent outlook," 
his "sense of poetry and poetic fitness," his self- 
consciousness, the very source of his eloquence. 
Especially pertinent is Mr. Curie's exposition of 
Mr. Meredith's philosophical and lyrical view of 
nature, of his treatment of women, of his sense of 
comedy. It is somewhat startling to come upon the 
assertion that Mr. Meredith is too intellectual to 
have absolute sympathy with humanity, and in this 
quality alone, according to Mr. Curie, he fails to 
reach the most profound and exact idea of character. 
His heart and soul, however, are filled with the great 
and permanent thoughts ; and for this reason he will 
come through the ordeal of criticism into the light 
of true recognition. 

Eavptian "^ recent importation of Messrs. 

civilization Scribner is " Bonaparte in Egypt 

down to date. ^nd the Egyptians of Today," by 
Haji A. Browne, an Englishman who, it seems, has 
assimilated the oriental civilization. The author 
declares that during the last twelve hundred years 
six great events have influenced Egyptian history : 
the Arab conquest, the Turkish conquest, the French 
invasion, the rise of Mahomet Ali, the English oc- 
cupation, and the evacuation of Fachoda by the 



French. Of this book, the larger part is devoted 
to the French invasion, with some attention to the 
later history of Egypt. The author's purpose is to 
interpret the Egyptain character, and in so doing 
to make clear how the French and English have 
blundered when trying to rule this people. It is 
his thesis that whUe for scores of hundreds of years 
foreign rulers have governed the land, none of them 
has made any effort to understand the people and 
secure their cooperation. This was especially true, 
it is asserted, of the French, who were untactful and 
impatient in their attempts to force revolutionary 
reforms upon an alien race. Unfortunately, the 
author has chosen not to indicate the authorities 
upon whom he bases his account, though it is clear 
that almost the whole of the part about the French 
invasion and its results is taken from the native 
historian Gabarty, or Jibarty. He is very reckless 
in dealing with the facts of European history, and 
his generalizations are sweeping and frequently 
contradictory. He makes it clear that under French 
and English rule the Egyptians had the best gov- 
ernment in their history, and yet he spends pages 
denouncing European methods. One result of his 
delineation of the character of Egyptians is to make 
them appear a peculiarly worthless lot — something 
certainly not intended. In spite of its mmaerous 
faults, the book has distinct value. It describes the 
various elements of the Egyptian population and 
their relation each to the others, it makes somewhat 
intelligible the relation of the subject people to their 
rulers during their long history, it shows how evil 
has resulted from the attempt to force European 
standards upon an Oriental people, and finally it 
explains the various healthy and unhealthy influ- 
ences operating to-day in the land of the Pharaohs. 

A scientist and ^^ofessor Frederick Starr, the in- 
his camera in defatigable anthropologist of the 
Indian Mexico. University of Chicago, has made a 
succession of journeys through Southern Mexico, 
visiting the states of Mexico, Puebla, Vera Cruz, 
Chiapas, Oaxaca, Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Tamaulipas, 
and Yucatan, in search of anthropological material 
among the Aztecs, Chontals, Chinantecs, Chochos, 
Chols, Cuicatecs, Huaxtecs, Juaves, Mayas, Maza- 
tecs. Mixes, Mixtecs, Otomis, Tarascans, Tlaxcalans, 
Triquis, Tzendals, Tzotzils, Zapotecs, and Zoques 
tribes of Indians. The pursuit of his investigations 
included the measurement of a hundred men and 
twenty-five women in each population (fourteen 
measurements being taken upon each subject), the 
making of plaster casts of the heads and busts of five 
individuals in each tribe, and the taking of photo- 
graphs illustrating the scenery, occupations, char- 
acter of buildings, costumes, and habits of life, 
encountered on the way. In a population ignorant, 
timid, and suspicious, such a plan was necessarily 
fraught with difficxilty and personal danger, even 
after the interest of the political and ecclesiastical 
authorities had been procured. The scientific re- 
sults of these journeys have been published in a

considerable number of books and papers. In a 
large octavo of more than four hundred pages with 
the title " In Indian Mexico" (Forbes & Company, 
Chicago) Professor Starr gives to the general pub- 
lic a narrative of travel in a part of Mexico that 
has heretofore escaped the notice of the traveller 
and writer, with only incidental references to the 
scientific phases of his journeys. That the journeys 
were filled with experiences ranging from the comic 
to the tragic, may be taken for granted. That 
the narrative has literary faults, cannot be denied. 
Many of the author's experiences were repeated, 
with but slight variations, in several places, and did 
not require the explicit repetition which they receive. 
And the meagre accounts of some tragic experiences 
serve to pique the reader's curiosity without grati- 
fying it. But these faults are largely atoned for by 
the general interest of the narrative, and especially 
by the hundred and sixty half-tone illustrations from 
the author's photographs. 

By publishing his " Winter Days in 
^'Ji^lTZT I«^^" ^t the beginning of summer, 

Mr. Lazell makes it possible for 
us to learn how much relief from heat can be had 
from reading about cold. It is refreshing to the 
senses and stimulating to the imagination to read on 
a day when the mercury in the thermometer is much 
too high for comfort, that " the snow is piling high 
under the hazelbrush and the sumac," or that there 
is "a continuous sound of grinding ice from the 
river." Mr. Lazell has little that is new to say 
about Nature, but his book is opportune in this com- 
fort of suggested contrast, and farther enjoyable for 
its delicate sense of the beauty of winter woods and 
meadows. Moreover, there is often a new grace in 
the manner of saying things, as in this appreciation 
of March wind in the tree-tops : " The coarse, an- 
gular, unyielding twigs of the oaks give deep tones 
like the vibrations of the thick strings on the big 
double-bass. The opposite widespreading twigs of 
the ash sing like the 'cello, and the tones of the 
alternating sprays of the lindens are finer, like the 
viola. The still smaller opposite twigs of the 
maples murmur like the tender tones of the altos 
and the fine yielding spray of the birches. The 
feathery elm and the hackberry make music pure 
and sweet as the waUing of the first violins." (The 
Torch Press, Cedar Rapids, Iowa.) 

The philosopher "There is no escaping Nietzsche. 
of hyperbole You may hold him a hissing and a 
and paradox. mockery and lift your virtuous skirts 
as you pass him by, but his roar is in your ears and 
his blasphemies sink into your mind. He has 
coloured the thought and literature, the speculation 
and theorizing, the politics and superstition of the 
time. He reigns as king in the German universities 
— where, since Luther's day, all the world's most 
painful thinking has been done — and his echoes 
tinkle, harshly or faintly, from Chicago to Meso- 
potamia." The fervid, vigorous style and the hyper- 



bolic impressiveness of Mr. Henry F. Mencken's 
book are well illustrated in this passage from his 
Introduction to an exposition of Nietzsche's phil- 
osophy. Despite his seemingly dispassionate atti- 
tude toward the doctrine of his subject, Mr. Mencken 
reveals himself as so ardent and so expert an advo- 
cate that one is tempted to reach over his head to 
administer a few thumps to the prophet himself. 
But that would require a separate chapter. Mr. 
Mencken has produced a very readable book and a 
better presentation of Nietzsche to the English 
reader than is elsewhere available. Critically speak- 
ing, it has one serious fault, — that the reader is 
often left in doubt as to where the author is speak- 
ing his own views and where he is merely presenting 
those of Nietzsche. This is no problem to one already 
familiar with the German-Polish prophet, but the 
book is evidently intended for those to whom he is a 
stranger. Quotation, condensed abstract and com- 
ment are often merged so gradually and smoothly 
that only an adept can recognize the limits of the 
last element. This is unfortunate in the exposition 
of a philosopher so full of hyperbole and paradox as 
Nietzsche. On the other hand, Mr. Mencken has 
so steeped himself in the style and spirit of Nietzsche 
that his book has almost the unity of a first-hand 
production. Like the original, it can be trusted to 
reveal to the reader the one-sided, unsound, and often 
illogical nature of the thought of this strange, and 
it is to be hoped transient, phenomenon in German 
philosophy. (Luce & Company.) 



John Sherman. J^^" Sherman played an important 
financier and part in the history of this country 
statesman. during its second half-century, and 

it was his desire that this part should be fully known 
to his countrymen and to the world. During his 
lifetime he published two large volumes of remin- 
iscences, giving his own version of the history of 
his time and of his part in that history ; and in his 
will he provided for a formal biography. This bio- 
graphy has now appeared in two large volumes 
written by a fellow-townsman, Mr. Winfield S. 
Kerr, and published by Messrs. Sherman, French, 
& Company. The book contains a vast amount of 
information about our history and politics during 
the period of Sherman's public life, and every step 
in his career is minutely set forth in its relations to 
current affairs ; it may be useful as a storehouse of 
facts, generally fairly given, though these may 
usually be obtained more easily from books of ref- 
erence and formal histories. It is a biography of 
the old-fashioned type, written by a man who has 
been active in politics but without much training in 
literary work. The actions of the hero are not 
always allowed to speak for themselves, and super- 
latives are freely used in the effort to make the 
reader appreciate his virtues. Students of financial 
affairs especially will find here much to interest 
them, for John Sherman was certainly one of the 
gi"eat practical financiers of our history.

author of "American Insects," "Darwinism To-day," 
etc., has in press with Messrs. Henry Holt Co., to be 
issued in their American Nature Series, a volume entitled 
" Insect Stories." These " strange, true stories of insect 
life " are primarily for young folks, but will also appeal 
to grown-up nature-lovers. 

In connection with the very general and keen interest 
in the revival of arts and crafts in America it is interest- 
ing to look into the past, particularly to those centuries 
known as the Middle Ages, in which the handicrafts 
flourished in special perfection, and to see how these 
crafts were pursued, and exactly what these arts really 
were. An interesting work on this subject by Julia 



deW. Addison will be published shortly by Messrs. 
L. C. Page & Co. under the title "The Arts and Crafts 
of the Middle Ages." 

Miss Grace Norton's series of books about Montaigfne 
has been enlarged by two new volumes. One of them 
is a collection of passages concerning " his personal rela- 
tions to some of his contemporaries and his literary 
relations to some later writers " ; the other, called " The 
Spirit of Montaigne," is an anthology of passages repro- 
ducing something of the thought and expression of the 
famous " Essays." The volumes are published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. 

The Concordance Society reports progress in a cir- 
cular which states that a concordance to Gray is soon 
to be published, and that concordances to Spenser, 
Herbert, Wordsworth, Marlowe, Tennyson, and Keats 
are in various stages of preparation. This is good news, 
but such publications have to be subsidized, and the 
Society needs more members and more funds. Pro- 
fessor A. H. Tolman, of the University of Chicago, 
represents the Society in the West.

JONAS LIE. 



The great names of Ibsen and Bjomson have 
so overshadowed the names of their fellow- 
workers in the field of letters that to the world 
at large they have appeared to comprise the 
sum total of contemporary Norwegian literature. 
Norway is so small a country that it has seemed 
something of a concession on the part of the out- 
side public to recognize the significance of even 
its two foremost spokesmen to mankind, and 
nothing short of compelling geniite would have 
been able to force such a tribute. Nevertheless, 
Norway has been for the past century a nation 
in spirit (now being one in fact also), and from 
the days when Wergeland sounded his trumpet 
call of emancipation all the way down to our own 
its proud people have claimed the attributes of 
other and larger peoples, and among those at- 
tributes the possession of a distinctive national 
literature. That literature, as the investigator 
speedily discovers, is surprisingly rich when we 
consider all the circumstances of its development, 
and is adorned by many names besides those of 
its Dioscuri of world-wide fame. Among those 
names that of Jonas Lie, who died at Christiania 
on the fifth of this month, in his seventy-fifth 
year, takes a high place — perhaps the place of 
third importance in the Norwegian literature of 
the past forty years. 

Less than a year the junior of Bjomson, 
and only five years the junior of Ibsen, Jonas 
Lauritz Idemil Lie was bom November 6, 1833, 
the son of a lawyer father and a Finnish mother. 
The late Professor Boyesen found in him a sort 
of dual personality, and sought to account for 
it by the mingling of strains that gave him 
birth. From his mother he " inherited the 
fantastic strain in his blood, the strange super- 
stitious terrors, and the luxuriant wealth of color 
which he lavished upon his poems and his first 
novel." From his father he " derived his good 
sense, his intense appreciation of detail, and his 
strong grip on reality. His career represents 
at its two poles a progression from the adven- 
turous romanticism of his maternal heritage to 
the severe wide-awake realism of the paternal 
— the emancipation of the Norseman from the 
Finn." It was the Finn in him that first de- 
veloped and found expression in his writings, 



28 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



for his boyhood was spent in Nordland, where 
nature is fantastic and superstition is in the air. 
Afterwards, when he became a lawyer, and 
contracted one of the most lastingly happy of 
marriages, the Norseman got the upper hand, 
and he became hard-headed and practical. 

As a boy, his first ambition was to be a gun- 
smith, his next to go to sea. He was actually 
an applicant for naval training, but was rejected 
on account of myopia. After this rebuff, there 
was nothing for it but the regular educational 
grind, so he went to Christiania, and passed 
through the preparatory school to the Univer- 
sity. Bjornson and Ibsen were both among his 
associates at this time, and then began his life- 
long friendship with the former, to whose early 
influence he often acknowledged a deep indebt- 
edness. His parents wanted to make him a 
parson, but he preferred to become a lawyer, 
and was presently at work in the practice of 
his profession in the rich lumber town of 
Kongsvinger. He regarded the calling he had 
chosen as a choice of evils, but he prospered in 
it — giving it variety by dabblings in politics 
and journalism — and in the early thirties found 
himself a fairly well-to-do man and an important 
personage. Then came the financial crash of 
1867-8, which swept away every dollar he had, 
besides leaving him technically responsible for 
many more — the consequence of an easy-going 
habit of endorsing commercial paper for his 
friends. This catastrophe marked the turning- 
point in Lie's life. He decided to abandon the 
law and become a man of letters. He even 
determined, manfidly, and perhaps quixotically, 
to follow Scott's example, and earn by novel- 
writing the wherewithal to meet the heavy 
obligations which weighed him down, and from 
which he might easily enough have obtained 
legal release. 

From the time of his early twenties. Lie had 
been a scribbler of verse, but his song was more 
rugged than pleasing, and its cacophonies more 
frequent than its harmonies. Nevertheless, the 
volume of his " Poems," dated 1867, and re- 
issued, with additions, more than a score of years 
later, has to be reckoned with. It includes 
ringing songs of the sea and studies in fantastic 
romance that betoken a genuine gift. But it 
was as a novelist that Lie was to gain his real 
fame, and when he started life over again in 
Christiania, it was to the writing of fiction that 
he gave his best energies. For the first years, 
life was hard. He had a wife and four chil- 
dren, and it was not easy to support them. He 
eked out some sort of a living by school-teaching 



and political journalism, until, in 1870, he 
achieved a brilliant success with " The Vision- 
ary," his first novel. It was a revelation of 
the Finnish side of his personality, and was 
filled with the memories of his youth under the 
Arctic circle. Besides bringing him a financial 
reward, this novel also brought him govern- 
mental recognition, which at first took the form 
of a travelling stipend for several years, and 
then made him, like Bjornson and Ibsen, the 
recipient of the annual " poet's salary" with 
which the enlightened Norwegian nation encour- 
ages literary talent. The amount is not large, 
but the honor is great, and is apt to stimulate 
to heightened endeavor. He went to Rome, 
that Mecca of Scandinavian men of letters, and 
devoted himself to the double task of broaden- 
ing his culture and writing further novels. The 
succeeding years produced a long series of books, 
of which we may mention the following: " The 
Barque Future" (1872), "The Pilot and His 
Wife " (1874), " Thomas Ross " (1878), " Adam 
Schrader " (1879), " Rutland " (1881), " Press 
On" (1882), "The Life Prisoner" (1883), 
"The Family at Gilje " (1883), "A Mael- 
strom " (1884), " Married Life " (1887), " Maisa 
Jons" (1888), "The Commodore's Daughters " 
(1890), " Powers of Evil " (1890), " Niobe " 
(1893), and " When the Curtain Falls " (1901). 
This list is far from complete, but it includes the 
most important titles. The book last-named, 
like Ibsen's " When We Dead Awake," is a 
sort of epilogue to the work of his life. A 
contemporary critio. Dr. Poul Levin, calls it 
Lie's deepest and most comprehensive work. 
" It has a sort of finality, because it comprises 
all of Lie's other books, and may hardly be 
understood without taking them for granted." 
Besides the books above named. Lie was the 
author of many sketches and short stories, and 
of a few works in dramatic form, the most 
noticeable of which, " Grabow's Cat," enjoyed 
a moderate theatrical success. We must say a 
special word of " Trold," a collection of fantastic 
tales published in 1892. In this work the 
incurable romanticism of his nature once more 
found expression, and the realist seemed to have 
disappeared. Bpyesen says of this work : "It 
was as if a volcano, with writhing torrents of 
flame and smoke, had burst forth from under a 
sidewalk in Broadway." When we consider the 
totality of his work, in connection with the fact 
that his first novel was not written until he had 
reached middle life, we must wonder at a literary 
activity so surprising. For his work, volumin- 
ous as it is, was always conscientiously done, and 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



29 



everywhere exhibits a fineness of texture that 
betokens the artist. 

In the course of his development, Lie essayed 
several styles and themes. His earlier successes 
seemed to mark him as the novelist of sea-faring 
folk, and to set him beside his Danish contem- 
porary Drachmann. Later, he plunged into real- 
ism, and " The Life Prisoner " brought him into 
comparison with Zola and Dostoievsky. The 
special problems of business life had a fascina- 
tion for him ; he knew them well from his own 
experience, and worked them into some of his 
novels. In the delineation of his heroines, and 
the presentation of the feminine point of view, 
he exhibited an insight and a delicate sympathy 
that made him comparable with Ibsen. Lastly, 
he was the novelist of the home, with its tender 
intimacies and its strong influence upon the 
development of character. It is perhaps in this 
last aspect, as illustrated by " The Family at 
Gilje " and " Married Life," that he is most 
cherished by his fellow-countrymen. 

From the time of his first visit to Rome, Lie's 
life was that of a cosmopolitan. Paris was his 
favorite residence, and, in fact, his home for a 
large part of every year. He felt, no less 
strongly than Bjornson and Ibsen, that the 
chief need of Scandinavians was to be kept in 
contact with the fresh currents of the intellec- 
tual life of Europe. He spoke particularly of 
the " eruptive " character of German, French, 
and Russian literature, and of the way in which 
they " were showering the kindling sparks of 
new ideas and glowing aspirations upon the 
farthest corners of the earth." But his inter- 
pretation of modern modes of thought always 
made for soberness and sanity, and he was 
never tempted to join the band of those modern 
writers who seem to think that genius, to prove 
its title, must be erratic. His work now ended, 
he has joined the wife whose companionship 
was the chief factor in his happiness, and whose 
death, not long ago, was such a grief as he had 
never before known. State honors were be- 
stowed upon his obsequies. 



The westward movement of the American Library- 
Association, in its change of headquarters from Boston 
to Chicago, as decreed by the librarians lately in session 
at Minnetonka, is a natural and a desirable action. The 
centre of the American library world is no longer in New 
England, energetic and progressive though that section 
of the country has always been in all that relates to the 
diffusion of learning. As already observed by us, Chicago 
is becoming more and more nearly the centre of our 
library-using population, and it will be a good many 
years before that central point, or central meridian, will 
be found to have shifted still further toward the west. 



THE SOLIDARITY OF LITERATURE. 

If a stranger to our planet, unacquainted with its 
natural laws, were to go down to the margin of the 
sea, at the lowest ebb of the tide, he would find the 
ocean stretching motionless before him, apparently 
fixed within set bounds. But presently little tongues 
of wave would begin to run up unto his feet ; if he 
stood stiU they would encircle him and cut him off 
from dry land ; then the billows would come rolling 
in, each higher than the last ; he would look about 
him in despair ; it would seem to him that that quiet 
thing, the sea, had become alive, and was preparing 
to swallow the earth and the monuments thereof. 
But our stranger need only to wait ; the earth would 
still lift its head above the waters ; little by little 
these would recede, and everything would be as it 
was before. 

The movements and momentary fads of litera- 
ture are much like the tides. They are necessary to 
keep the ocean of life from stagnating, the world of 
humanity alive ; but they are recurrent, periodical, 
and do not change anything very much. 

The banners under which artists and writers fight 
— the watchwords, shibboleths, party cries which 
they go forward sounding, — are fine things to 
inspire them, to keep them together, to nerve them 
for the struggle. Men are always more willing to go 
out and be killed if they are dressed up in uniform 
and have a standard advancing before them. And 
the waving of flags, the flourishing of trumpets, the 
agitations of battle, are good to impress and draw 
the attention of the public. Mankind would prob- 
ably sit down content with its old art, if every now 
and then someone did not start up to tell it that the 
work of the past was faded and false and foolish, 
and that he had a recipe for a new literature, a new 
music, a new painting, which would rejuvenate the 
world. And, being curious, mankind very often 
does trade the old lamps for the new ones and gives 
away a talisman which can command the genii for a 
tin vessel. 

There are, and always have been, two great 
armies encamped over against each other in litera- 
ture — the idealists and the realists : those who 
paint man as he is, and those who paint him as he 
should be ; those who draw from the idea, and those 
who copy from experience. All the skirmishes, 
forays, onsets, retreats and changing fortunes of 
literature are part of this great war. Yet the com- 
batants are always changing sides or setting up 
separate standards of their own, and in the last 
analysis there is so little difference between them 
that the mellay seems to be carried on for fun 
rather than for principle. 

In one of the first and finest pieces of literary 
criticism we have, " The Frogs " of Aristophanes, 
the struggle I have indicated is shown as on in full 
force. The great comic poet adored -fli^schylus, 
respected Sophocles, and detested Euripides as a 
newcomer and a leveller. Undoubtedly there are 
differences in the poetic gifts of the three men — 



30 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



between the heroic sublimity of ^schylus, the serene 
steady art of Sophocles, and the sentimental and pa- 
thetic naturalness of Euripides, But they all painted 
life, they all projected wonderful and remarkable 
figures, and the work of one could very easily be 
mistaken for that of another, ^schylus might have 
been proud to claim the Bacchanals, and Euripides 
might easily have signed the Philoctetes. To-day all 
their pieces are alike classic and supposed to be 
separated by a wide gulf of demarcation from mod- 
ern work. I say supposed ; for the Greek plays 
have the one and only quality which really counts 
in literature — vitality. Even as stage plays, given 
a fair chance, they could probably hold their own 
against anything new. 

The terms " classic " and " romantic " came into 
use in Germany perhaps a hundred and fifty years 
ago as the shibboleths of two opposing factions. 
Classic was supposed to indicate a view of life, an 
attitude of mind, sane, noble, healthy ; romantic, a 
diseased and morbid condition of thought which 
drove one to deal in horrors of any kind — -death- 
heads, charnel vaults, religious mania, sexual aber- 
rations, the supernatural. Goethe, by precept and 
example, pointing to Greek literature, enforced this 
distinction. I confess I am unable to see anything 
eminently sane and wholesome in the horrible stories 
of Agamemnon or Qidipus, in the murderous frenzies 
of Achilles. And the supernatural in the Odyssey, 
the Persians, the Golden Ass of Apuleius, is very 
much like the supernatural in the Divine Comedy, 
Hamlet, or the folk-lore stories. It must be remem- 
bered that we have very little of Greek literature. 
If we could browse through the Alexandrian library 
we could probably find a parallel and analogue for 
every modern book or mode of thought. 

After the classicists and romanticists had fought 
out their fight, the realists came upon the scene and 
buried their predecessors, dead and living alike, — 
and, indeed, buried the whole past, as savoring of 
decay. Nothing was worth while except brand-new 
documents of life. Everything had to be painted 
or photographed from the model ; and as the easiest 
models to come at were of the low or middle classes, 
literature sunk at once to the mediocre in intelli- 
gence and form. Prose superseded verse — the 
novel, the drama. The return to nature which was 
preached meant a descent to the commonplace. 
Writers went about by the score with their note- 
books open to take down the most meaningless 
chatter or to mark the most insignificant acts of 
mankind. Any old bore of a farmer or sailor or 
fisherman could become the hero ; any empty- 
headed, goose-necked girl, the heroine of a book. 
But as the poorest writer in the world inevitably 
craves for something strong in character or plot or 
situation, realism broke into two branches — one, 
naturalism, dealing with the horrible details of pov- 
erty and vice, and finally setting up a school of its 
own, the decadents, who glorified these things ; and 
the other, satire, which healthfully reacted upon its 
material with humor — poured salt in the wounds 



of life to heal them. It is hardly necessary to say 
that none of the doctrines of realism were new — 
none of its works without previous example. The 
new comedy of Athens must have precisely antici- 
pated, and in a more brilliant fashion, all that our 
realists have done. The young poet who was ad- 
vised to study the people, and replied that he had 
just bought a copy of Terence and Plautus, was not 
so far wrong. Lucian and Petronius could give 
points to Zola or Maupassant. Indeed, there is a 
Hindoo play — " The Little Clay Cart " of King 
Shudraka — which, sixteen hundred years old, is 
fresher and truer in its realistic painting of life than 
almost any modern play or novel. And, strange to 
say, from this primitive Asiatic comedy emerge two 
of Shakespeare's most wonderful figui"es, Cloten and 
Imogen. 

The latest organized movement in literature seems 
to be that of Symbolism. Symbolism, I suppose, is 
largely the thing that used to be called allegory — 
and allegory is as old as the world. Whole epochs 
have been dominated by it — as, for example, the 
thirteenth century, when the two authors of the 
Roman de la Rose produced a pivotal work which 
influenced Dante on the one hand and Spenser on 
the other. Mankind has about made up its mind, 
however, that these poets are great in spite of, 
rather than because of, their allegory. As Hazlitt 
said, if you let the allegory in their works alone it 
won't bite you. Literature finally threw off the 
symbolical and produced Shakespeare with his direct 
rendering of life. Whatever we may think of the 
allegorical, the symbolical, the mystical qualities in 
literature, it is certain that they are nothing new, 
and it is doubtful whether they can again do any- 
thing which will equal their elaborate exercise in 
the past. 

Form in literature, no less than matter, has its 
street-cries to attract buyers. Style is lauded as 
though it were something separable from thought 
or art. Euphuism and preciosity have their day. 
Such tags of criticism as " the inevitable phrase," 
" the juste mot" " distinction," " nuance" and a 
dozen more, all perfectly proper in their proper 
places, are worked to death, forced into an import- 
ance they do not possess. People make a creed out 
of a claw of Jove's eagle. Some authors go about 
proclaiming that prose is a finer form of expression 
than verse. Others are wildly sure that the over- 
loaded and intricate prose of De Quincey or Pater 
is our final and perfected speech, the large utterance 
of our future gods. Others are all for the uncon- 
ventional, for the verse run mad of Blake or 
Whitman. None of these methods or mannerisms 
of expression are original — are discoveries of those 
who preach them. All of them have been tried 
again and again in the progress of literatm-e. 

What are the new ideas that are floating in our 
air and fated to influence literary creation ? One 
is the idea of the new power of women. We talk 
as if the woman spirit had been confined, like the 
genie in the brass bottle, for all past ages, and was 



1908.]

now released, and, towering above man who had 
delivered it, was threatening to destroy him. The 
fable of woman's imprisonment in the past will 
hardly bear examination. In all times she has had 
greater leisure, and probably a greater average cul- 
tivation in the pleasing arts, than man. And a long 
line of poets, prophets, leaders, from Deborah and 
Sappho and Hypatia down, star the annals of every 
race and every age in proportion probably as numer- 
ous as to-day. Taking woman's work as a whole, 
I do not see that it has added any distinct or special 
quality to literature or art. 

Another large and vague idea trying to impose 
itself on literature is that of democracy. What is 
democracy ? I am inclined to think there is no 
such thing. I catch myself writing of middle and 
lower classes, — which is silly in an American, for 
we are all of the middle or lower classes. Where 
there is no rank fixed by law or custom there can 
be no upper class. Such transitory things as wealth 
or power will not make one. But there may be 
superiors and inferiors, and our whole social system 
is based upon superiority and inferiority. Go where 
you will, you wiU find people ordering and people 
obeying — people looked up to and people looked 
down upon. Every little hamlet, unmarked upon 
the map, has its king and his circle of courtiers. 
If democracy merely means the free opportunity 
to rise or fall, then perhaps we have realized it in 
America. But this halcyon state is not likely to 
hold. We have evolved tremendous powers which, 
unless human nature has changed from of old, will 
sooner or later try to perpetuate themselves. 

Optimism is a habit of mind rather than an idea. 
I do not know whether Americans have more hope 
and sunny expectations than other races, but we 
talk and preach them more. I think this rose- 
colored outlook, whatever effect it may have on life 
itself, is detrimental to literature. It banishes 
tragedy and all great and serious thought. It 
makes our art of all kinds thin and flat and savor- 
less. How are we going to make bricks without 
straw? — how produce great effects without great 
means ? — how project rounded figures without 
shadow? Our optimism and lack of depth are 
largely due to our material success, and to the fact 
that we have never known, as a nation, defeat, des- 
pair, and crushing grief. In a literary way, it has 
been taught us by Emerson. The New England 
prophet is a delightful "friend of the spirit," but 
the attempt to build either great lives or great books 
out of his preachments would be like carrying out 
smoke in a hand-basket. 

Is there, then, ever anything new in literature? 
or do the same old waves rise and recede as the 
moon guides its retinue around the earth? There 
is this: the individual spirit and gift of each new 
wi'iter. In Goethe's " Italian Journey " he de- 
scribes how he was once taken at night, with a party 
of artists, to the Vatican, to see the statues by torch- 
light. He describes the wonderful effects of the 
flashing torches upon the marble figures — altering, 



contorting, making them alive. The great statues 
of humanity, the circling background of nature, 
always exist the same. But each one of us has a 
uniquely burning, differently colored torch, which we 
flash upon these permanent forms. As we choose, 
we can concentrate its light upon some noble head 
with serene brow and solemn eyes ; or we can direct 
it upon the laboring limbs, or animal portions of 
the figure. We can let one statue stand out, while 
all the rest are swathed in darkness ; or we can move 
our light rapidly about and set the whole company 
in confused motion. We can reveal the central group 
of humanity, or we can illuminate the background of 
nature. Charles Leo^tard Moore. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

The " Atlantic's" change of ownership is almost 
as startling, not to say disconcerting, as would be a 
shifting of the sun's place of rising to some other part 
of the horizon. However, it is not probable that the 
motions of the heavenly bodies will be affected by the 
disappearance of the familiar Houghton and Mifflin 
imprint from the title-page of the magazine so long 
issued by that firm and by its predecessors; and this 
can be predicted the more confidently because the place 
of publication — No. 4 Park Street, Boston — will re- 
main unchanged. While Park Street Church and the 
" Atlantic " office withstand the ravages of time and 
progress, all is not lost. The new publishers, as we 
have already announced, are incoi-porated under the 
name of The Atlantic Monthly Company, with Mr. 
Ellery Sedgwick as president, Mr. Waldo Emerson 
Forbes as vice-president, and Mr. MacGregor Jenkins 
as treasurer. There we have at least five good New 
England names as a sort of guaranty that the " Atlantic " 
quality is not to suffer detriment. Further to reassure 
us, we are told that Mr. Bliss Perry will retain the 
editorship. It is also promised by the publishers that 
the magazine " will steadily broaden its scope and pur- 
poses " — words of doubtful omen, one might fear, with 
a dread suggestion of "special features," illustrations 
(perhaps in color !) and who knows what besides ! But 
all such alarm is groundless, no doubt, and " the Amer- 
ican Blackwood " will continue its decorous course, we 
may hope, to the edification and uplifting of generations 
yet unborn. . , , 

Cleveland as a phrase-maker, as the author of 
certain terse and unforgettable expressions, will enjoy 
a fame distinct from, and perhaps as lasting as, his 
renown as a statesman. " A public office is a public 
trust" we owe to him. " Innocuous desuetude " has 
long since passed into popular speech, as also " It is a 
condition which confronts us — not a theory." It was 
Cleveland who considered " the pension list of the 
republic a roll of honor," and declared that " party 
honesty is party expediency." Only four years ago, in 
his characterization of Judge Parker, then candidate 
for the presidency, as " safe, sane, and undramatic," he 
hit on a happy collocation of adjectives that ran so 
trippingly upon the tongue as to delight his hearers. In 
the utterance of his opinion on the eligibility of a pres- 
ident for reelection, he spoke severely of the " horde of 
office-holders, with a zeal born of benefits received and

fostered by the hope of favors yet to come "; and he 
elsewhere referred to the gratitude of politicians as 
derived from " a lively expectation of favors to come." 
Perhaps he had been reading Walpole as quoted by 
Hazlitt in his " Wit and Humour," — " The gratitude 
of place-expectants is a lively sense of future favors." 
And doubtless, also, he was familiar with Rochefou- 
cauld's often-repeated maxim, " The gratitude of most 
men is but a secret desire of receiving greater benefits." 
But truisms did not suffer in his phrasing. Like Lincoln, 
he had a faculty of making " home-truths seem more 
true," and of putting a fundamental truth into apt 
words that linger in the memory.

The starting of an epoch-making newspaper 
was fitly commemorated a few days ago by the placing 
of a bronze memorial tablet on the office building that 
has recently arisen at the northeast corner of Congress 
and Water Streets, Boston. The tablet is thus inscribed : 
On this spot 
WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON 
began the publication of 
"The Liberator" 
January 1, 1831. 



In a small chamber, friendless and unseen. 

Toiled o'er his types one poor, unlearned young man ; 

The place was dark, unfumitured and mean. 
Yet there the freedom of a race began. 

Begun without capital or subscribers, and printed from 
borrowed or hired type, the venturesome journal was 
kept going by the night labors of its editor and founder, 
and of his devoted partner in the desperate enterprise, 
Isaac Knapp. The tablet, bearing as it does the open- 
ing stanza of Lowell's fine poem " To W. L. Garrison," 
serves well to supplement the earlier memorial on 
Commonwealth Avenue, which is in the form of a statue 
of Garrison, its pedestal inscribed with the motto of his 
paper, " My Country is the World; my Countrymen are 
all Mankind," and also with his declaration, as printed 
in the first number: " I am in earnest; I will not equiv- 
ocate ; I will not excuse ; I will not retreat a single inch, 
and I will be heard." 

Manuscript reproduction by rotograph, the 
technical details of which hardly come within our 
province, appears to be a not unsatisfactory solution of 
an old problem, — namely, how to make widely available 
the manuscript treasures of those European and other 
libraries and historical museums that are the fortunate 
possessors of these precious relics. From Western 
Reserve University word reaches us that the library 
there has recently acquired a rotograph facsimile of a 
Worcester Cathedral manuscript, and that the script, 
standing out boldly in white on a black ground, is in 
many places, where the original has suffered injury, 
even more legible, more sharply defined, than the 
manuscript itself. Rotography is said now to be satis- 
factorily executed by the Clarendon Press, and the fac- 
similes thus produced are not thought any more trying 
to the eyes than are the originals. American students 
unable to visit European libraries and archives, but 
desiring access to mediaeval manuscripts, are likely to 
profit greatly by the new process of reproduction, 
especially since the Modern Language Association has 
concerted measures for cooperative work among public 
libraries of this country whereby rotographs of all the 
most important manuscripts consulted by scholars will 
in time, it is hoped, be available to American students 
who are within reach of any of the cooperating libraries. 



The Passing of " Uncle Remus " brings sadness 
to his thousands of readers and admirers. Our " Amer- 
ican iEsop " was a most lovable character, with none of 
the biting, sardonic quality of his Greek prototype. His 
negro dialect stories, rich in folklore but delightfully 
free from the dreary dryness of much that is published 
under that name, are full of laughter and sunshine and 
light-heartedness. The irresponsible, happy-go-lucky 
son of Africa has been with us, in abundance, for gen- 
erations; but he waited for a Joel Chandler Harris to 
catch and reproduce his peculiar charms and graces. 
There have been many imitators, but the creator of 
" Uncle Remus " Temains facile princeps. To the Atlanta 
" Constitution," or rather to Evan Howell, long its able 
editor, is due the credit of discerning and encouraging 
Harris's native genius. It was in the columns of that 
newspaper that the earlier plantation stories appeared, 
side by side with editorial matter of a more serious 
nature which the versatile young journalist could so 
acceptably produce. And now he is cut off in the 
flower of his manhood, in his sixtieth year, and with 
him is silenced not only Uncle Remus, but we fear also 
" Uncle Remus's Magazine."

The psychology of reading has been discussed of 
late, chiefly apropos of a learned work setting forth the 
results of extended investigation in this department of 
intellectual activity. Rapid readers, it is now alleged, 
are likely to be also quick at fig^es, and vice versa, — 
which is not surprising. A literary worker, having need 
of a reader to digest a vast amount of printed matter 
for him, chose, after examinmg a number of candidates, 
the one who was readiest at solving arithmetical prob- 
lems. One queries whether that quick-witted person, 
with all his capacity for rapid assimilation of others' 
writings, had any literary talent of his own. How 
many great authors there have been who were self- 
confessedly deficient in mathematical ability, some of 
them being apparently floored by the simplest problem 
in pounds, shillings, and pence, especially where their 
ovm exchequer was concerned. The lover of good lit- 
erature who professes to have gone through fourteen 
volumes of Parkman in one year, by reading him but 
ten minutes a day, is either an unusually rapid reader 
or an inaccurate counter of minutes ; for the time spent 
on each volume, at ten minutes a day, figures itself out 
to be four hours and twenty minutes, and the necessity 
of fixing the attention and getting up speed for only so 
short a period at a time greatly increases the difficulty 
of the alleged achievement. But this reader may have 
extraordinary powers of mental concentration. Park- 
man's works, fascinating as they are, do not exactly fall 
within the class of light reading. 

Book-backs as educators are not held in high 
esteem by Librarian Willcox of the Peoria Public Li- 
brary. In a paper read at Minnetonka at the recent 
gathering of the American Library Association he de- 
clares himself strongly opposed to allowing the public 
to roam at large through the library stack-room, gazing, 
for the most part in idle curiosity, at the backs of books, 
or handling the volumes so ungently as to arouse 
apprehensions lest before long the whole library will 
be " thumbed out of existence," as Mr. John Thomson 
of Philadelphia has expressed it. Figures showing the 
ruinous expense from theft incurred by various large 
open-shelf libraries are quoted by Mr. Willcox; and his 
own Peoria system of restricted access, but unlimited

aid and advice from intelligent and nimble assistants, 
is attractively presented. It is probable that this vexed 
question of how far the public should be trusted by the 
custodians of books will be discussed as long as libra- 
rians continue to convene and to read papers ; and it is 
also not improbable that the discussions will take their 
tone largely from the age and temperament of the 
participants, those saddened and made wiser by years 
of experience being generally opposed to the removal of 
locks and bars, and the young and sanguine and youth- 
fully optimistic lifting their voices in favor of a more 
magnanimous and generous and imsuspicious policy. 
Mr. WiUcox, with all his energy and progressiveness, 
is, in point of years, one of our older librarians. 

A WARKING TO VIOLATORS OF LIBRARY RULES may 

be read in the issue of the late Harvard- Yale boat-race. 
The very powers above that rule over the destinies of 
nations and the fortunes of inter-collegiate sports have 
declared themselves on the side of the vigilant librarian 
and the inexorably-just president of Harvard, one of 
whom caught two members of the crew in the act of 
removing from the library precincts, without due per- 
mission, a book that they desired to peruse in privacy, 
while the other official punished this infraction of 
the rules by suspending the offenders and (as a conse- 
quence of the suspension) incapacitating them for taking 
part in the great aquatic contest of the season. Protests 
and prayers, beating of breasts and shedding of tears, 
with dire forebodings of ignominious defeat at New 
London, followed upon this punitive edict, and a green 
and yellow melancholy settled over Cambridge — and 
over the White House at Washington. But lo ! when 
the fateful day arrived, the boat thus deprived at the 
last moment of its stoutest oarsmen, but purged of its 
sin of book-misappropriation, swept proudly to the goal 
far in the lead of its rival. How pleased must then have 
been that librarian and that president, who could not 
love their college so much loved they not honor more !

Books by multimillionaires are not yet so numer- 
ous that the appearance of a new one can pass unnoted. 
Mr. John D. Rockefeller's forthcoming autobiography 
is sure to be read for many reasons that will in no way 
relate to its literary excellence. It is announced that 
the October number of " The World's Work " will 
contain the first instalment of this life of the greatest 
of money-makers; and the appearance in book form of 
the completed work, after it has run its course in the 
magazine, is a foregone conclusion. A query that may 
suggest itself to some is this : What honorariiun that 
will not look too insignificant for acceptance will the 
magazine publishers offer to this man of imcounted 
millions ? That he will receive a check for some 
amount is to be assumed, little though he needs it. 
Why would it not be a good plan for him and his 
millionaire associates in authorship — Messrs. Carnegie, 
Lawson, and William Waldorf Astor — to devote the 
earnings of their pens to the establishment of a fund for 
the relief or encouragement of impecunious writers ?

Revision of copyright laws is asked for by the 
International Congress of Publishers lately in session 
at Madrid. A resolution was adopted that the confer- 
ence to be held next October in Berlin to revise the 
Berne Convention should be asked to consider the 
following proposed reforms: (1) The abolition of all 
formalities for the guarantee of literary, artistic, and 



musical copyright. (2) The full and complete assimi- 
lation of the right of translation to the right of repro- 
duction. (3) The unification of the duration of authors' 
rights, which is to be fixed at fifty years from the death 
of the author. (4) The full and complete protection of 
authors and composers against the reproduction of their 
works by means of mechanical instruments of all kinds. 
The delegates from Germany favored, in the third 
clause, a period of thirty instead of fifty years. But 
why thirty, or fifty, or any other fixed number of years ? 
Shall the products of the intellect, the things that are 
unseen and eternal, be treated with less respect, safe- 
guarded less jealously, than the things that are seen 
and temporal ? ... 

A summer abode of genius is that known as " The 
Cornish Colony " of authors and artists, which has 
gradually, almost stealthily, come into being on the 
rock-ribbed hills of New Hampshire, just across the 
Connecticut River from Windsor, Vermont, and in the 
sunset shadow of Mt. Ascutney. Here are gathered a 
notable group of cultured men and women, including 
in their roster such names as Percy Mackaye, Louis 
Shipman, Langdon Mitchell, Maxfield and Stephen 
Parrish, W. W. Hyde, H. O. Walker, Kenyon and 
Louisa Cox, Augustus St. Gaudens (now living only in 
his works), Herbert Adams, Ann Lazarus, Winston 
Churchill, Norman Hapgood, and Peter F. Dunne. 
Though the colonists are far from wishing to be 
" written up," and shun interviews (of the journalistic 
kind) as they would the pest, they cannot object to our 
thinking of them in their quiet retreat from the noisy 
world. ... 

An aid in book-selection might be rendered by 
fitting up in every public library (that could afford it) 
a sort of model or standard library of the best liter- 
ature, properly safeguarded by vigilant attendants and 
duplicated in the book-stack for purposes of loan. The 
Providence Public Library, under its able head, Mr. 
William E. Foster, appears from its current annual 
report to maintain some such department as we have in 
mind. Miss Marguerite Reid reports concerning this 
" Standard Library " that " the recorded attendance has 
been 4,921 " — not so large as might have been wished 
— and that there has been " an increasing number of 
instances in which a reader who has become interested 
in some book in this collection does not leave the build- 
ing until he has had a copy of it (frequently some 
volume by Dickens or Thackeray) charged to him for 
home use." There are other libraries that have this 
useful and educative department besides the Providence 
institution. , , . 

The death of an accomplished journalist is 
recorded in the recent decease of Murat Halstead, whose 
name associates itself in most minds with the Cincinnati 
" Commercial." His first newspaper work was for a 
literary weekly, and the product of his fertile pen was 
throughout of more than usual hterary merit. Joining 
the staff of the " Commercial " at the age of twenty-four, 
he became twelve years later its controlling influence. 
The Brooklyn " Standard-Union " came subsequently 
under his editorship, and he has also published many 
books, biographical and politico-historical. His style 
was clear and fluent, and he was widely informed on 
matters of current interest. With the late Samuel 
Bowles and the still-living Colonel Henry Watterson, 
Murat Halstead attained distinction in the early seventies 
by standing sturdily for independent journalism.

William Blake— Poet, Artist, 
AND Man.* 

In his day, William Blake had a few ardent 
admirers ; by the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury he was to the world at large little more 
than a vaguely remembered name. William 
Allingham recorded in his diary, in August, 
1849 : " British Museum Library. Mr. Pat- 
more. He helps me look up Blake, but without 
success ; they seem to have nothing of his." 
Ten years earlier. Dr. James Garth Wilkinson 
had republished " Songs of Innocence and 
Experience." With the exception of his early 
" Poetical Sketches," this was the only one of 
Blake's books that had then been printed from 
type. The others had been struck off from the 
plates engraved by him, and had always been 
scarce. Occasionally at this period copies of 
them found their way into the second-hand 
bookshops ; and Mr. Evans, a printseUer in 
Great Queen Street, acquired a large collection 
of Blake's drawings, which Allingham and 
Rossetti went to see in the summer of 1857. 

Rescued from this semi-oblivion by the pub- 
lication of Gilchrist's biography in 1863, fol- 
lowed five years later by Swinburne's appreciative 
work, Blake has become the subject of a cult 
which has steadily grown and has yielded an 
abundant crop of critical essays, new editions of 
his poems, and interpretations of his " Prophetic 
Books." With bland assurance born of tower- 
ing egotism, Blake always claimed to be a genius. 
That the world now accepts him at his own 
estimate is shown, we are told, by the high 
prices his drawings, engravings, and the books 
of poetry illuminated by his hand, or that of his 
wife, now fetch in the market. 

Such, at least, is the statement made by Mr. 
Edwin J. EUis in " The Real Blake." This 
book, styled by its author " a portrait biog- 
raphy," and intended as a tribute to the memory 
of Blake and an explanation of the meanings 
hidden in his poems, is an extraordinary perform- 
ance. From one end to the other it is crammed 
with facts, real or alleged, animadversions upon 
other writers and other editors of Blake's 
poems, comments, quotations, and theories, all 
piled together in bewildering confusion. Perusal 
of its pages is like groping one's way through a

dense forest thickly crowded with underbrush. 
Plainly, the author has fallen a victim to his 
own enthusiasm. No one else, he thinks, knows 
Blakes writings as he does, or understands him 
so well, or has so fully penetrated aU the subtle- 
ties of his philosophy. Neither Mr. Swinburne 
nor Dr. Garnett nor Mr. Gilchrist may be 
trusted ; and as for Mr. Sampson, why, in his 
edition of " Blake's Poetical Works " he "gave 
his whole attention to verbal accuracy," and the 
volume, in the opinion of Mr. Ellis, is " empty 
of interpretation or intelligent poetic study." 

If Mr. Ellis had himself paid more attention 
to verbal accuracy in printing excerpts from 
Blake's writings, the value of his book would 
have been considerably enhanced. Instead, the 
text of the " Descriptive Catalogue " is given 
with Gilchrist's emendations ; the " Public 
Address " and the descriptions of the picture of 
" The Last Judgment " follow the Quaritch 
edition, and repeat its errors ; and the marginal 
notes to Swedenborg, Lavater, and Reynolds 
(nowhere else given so fully) are also marred 
by misprints. As for interpretation, it can 
hardly be said that Mr. Ellis has done much to 
penetrate the obscurity of Blake's mystic utter- 
ances. Of speculation there is a supei'abund- 
ance, and it is put forth with an air of certainty 
that waves aside all differences of opinion as 
not well grounded. To round out the picture ' 
of " the real Blake " as conceived by Mr. Ellis, 
there is even the recital of minute details of 
Blake's life which could only have been dis- 
covered through the exercise of " second sight " 
more wonderful than Blake's prophetic vision. 

So deeply has Mr. EUis delved (in imagin- 
ation) into Blake's mental processes, that he 
makes him incapable of revising his own work. 
" There were two Blakes," he teUs us, " and 
they could not edit one another." Yet this very 
statement is prefaced by an elaborate exposition 
of the lines from " Vala": 

" Saying, that I had never drunk the wine nor eat the bread 
Of dark mortality, nor cast my eyes into futurity, nor turned 
My back, darkening the present, clouding with a cloud." 

The second line, originally written 

"Of dark mortality, nor cast my eyes into the west, nor 
turned," 

was changed by Blake to 

" Of dark mortality, nor cast ray eyes into the futurity, nor 
turned," 

as Mr. Ellis points out ; whereupon he goes on 
to say " it should obviously read " 

" Of dark mortality, cast eyes into futurity," 

and the next line should be changed to 

" Nor turned my back dark'ning the present, clouding with 
a cloud,"

and he laments that these lines were not so 
printed in the Quaritch edition of Blake's poet- 
ical works which he edited in collaboration with 
Mr. W. B. Yeats. Evidently " the real Blake " 
is visible only through the fog of an Ellis mod- 
ification ! The presentation would have more 
reality were not Blake's work as an artist vir- 
tually ignored. In spite of its shortcomings, 
however, Mr. Ellis's book has distinct value for 
those who care to make an exhaustive study of 
Blake's poems ; but to separate the wheat from 
the chaff calls for the expenditure of much time 
and patiepce. 

From this involved and laborious effort, it 
is a pleasure to turn to Mr. Arthur Symons's 
compact, lucid, and orderly volume. Here we 
get at least a comprehensive view of Blake as 
poet, artist, and man, and something like intel- 
ligent appreciation and criticism. The task Mr. 
Symons set himself, of giving his " own narra- 
tive, containing, as briefly as possible, every 
fact of importance of what I took to be Blake's 
achievements and intentions," has been excel- 
lently performed, and has been supplemented 
by the reprint of every personal account of 
Blake printed during his lifetime, and, what is 
of real value, the complete text of every refer- 
ence to Blake in Crabb Robinson's Diary. 

Working in true scholarly spirit, Mr. Symons 
has not been content to take his facts at 
second-hand ; and after considerable research, 
and examination of parish registers and other 
sources of information, the theory put forth 
by Dr. Carter Blake, and accepted by Messrs. 
Ellis and Yeats, that Blake's grandfather was 
an Irishman named John O'Neil, who changed 
his name on marrying Ellen Blake, is dismissed 
as unsupported by a particle of documentary 
evidence. With dry details of this sort, however, 
Mr. Symons is not overmuch concerned. They 
cannot be ignored, nor yet taken for granted ; 
but they occupy little space in his book. 

Except in one respect, and that a most im- 
portant one, Mr. Symons's analysis of Blake's 
character and of his art leaves nothing to be 
desired. The finer shades are set forth with 
sympathy and understanding, which is perhaps 
the more subtly penetrating because of the flaw 
in his own philosophy that prevents him from 
reaching conclusions that are quite irrefragible. 
Overcome by the potency of Blake's thought, 
deeply impressed by his mental vigor, his abso- 
lute freedom from the trammels of conventional 
ideas of any sort, and his overwhelming imagina- 
tion, Mr. Symons is led to place an exaggerated 
estimate upon the value of Blake's work con- 



sidered as art. " It is," he asserts, " by his 
energy and nobility of creation that Blake takes 
rank among great artists." But in art it is not 
what is done, but how it is done, that makes 
the difference ; and measured by that infallible 
test, Blake's art falls somewhat short of greatness. 

Disturbed by some glimmering of this truth, 
Mr. Symons endeavors to get around it by a 
clever bit of special pleading : 

" There can hardly be a poet who is not conscious of 
how Uttle his own highest powers are under his own 
control. The creation of beauty is the end of art, but 
the artist should rarely admit to himself that such is 
his purpose. A poem is not written by the man who 
says: I will sit down and write a poem; but rather by 
the man who, captured by rather than capturing an 
impulse, hears a tune which he does not recognize, or 
sees a sight which he does not remember, in some * close 
comer of his brain,' and exerts the only energy at his 
disposal in recording it faithfully, in the medium of 
his particular art. And so in every creation of beauty, 
some obscure desire stirred in the soul, not realized by 
the mind for what it was, and, aiming at most other 
things in the world than pure beauty, produced it. 
Now, to the critic this is not more important to remem- 
ber than it is for him to remember that the result, the 
end, must be judged, not by the impulse which brought 
it into being, nor by the purpose which it sought to 
serve, but by its success or failure in one thing: the 
creation of beauty." 

Unfortunately, Mr. Symons does not always 
remember. He sees clearly that what Blake 
gives us in his pictures " is not a picture after a 
mental idea ; it is the literal delineation of an 
imaginative vision," and that what is unsatisfy- 
ing in them is attributable to " his dependence 
on a technique not as flexible as his imagination." 
What he does not perceive is that such beauty 
as may be found in Blake's designs is almost 
solely beauty of idea ; that they fail lamentably 
in the fundamental qualities of composition of 
line and mass which inevitably characterize all 
graphic art that may properly be labelled 
" great." But to the consideration of Blake as 
a poet he brings an unclouded vision, and it 
would be difficult indeed to express the truth 
more admirably than in such words as these : 

" Just as, in the designs which his hand drew as best it 
could, according to his limited and partly false knowl- 
edge, from the visions which his imagination saw with 
perfect clearness, he was often unable to translate that 
vision into its real equivalent in design, so in his attempts 
to put these other mental visions into words he was ham- 
pered by an equally false method, and often by remi- 
niscences of what passed for ' picturesque ' writing in the 
work of his contemporaries. He was, after all, of his 
time, though he was above it, and just as he only knew 
Michelangelo through bad reproductions, and could 
never get his own design wholly free, malleable, and 
virgin to his ' shaping spirit of imagination,' so, in spite 
of all his marvellous lyrical discoveries, made when his 
mind was less burdened by the weight of a controlling

message, he found himself, when he attempted to make 
an intelligible system out of the ' improvisations of the 
spirit,' and to express that system with literal accuracy, 
the half-helpless captive of formal words, conventional 
rhythms, a language not drawn direct from its source. 
Thus we find, in the Prophetic Books, neither achieved 
poems nor an achieved philosophy." 

No other writer has, on the whole, given a 
better picture of this strange genius, often 
childish, and yet so advanced in his ideas that 
his contemporaries thought him mad. In an 
interesting comparison between Blake and 
Nietzsche, the salient fact is brought out that 
it is not so much as an artist, nor as a poet, 
but as a thinker, that Blake was truly great. 
Altogether Mr. Symons has given us a book 
that we could not well spare, even though we 
may not be able to accept all his contentions. 

Miss Gary's " The Art of William Blake " 
is chiefly valuable for the reproductions it con- 
tains of more than fifty of his designs, a number 
of which, from his manuscript sketch-book, are 
now published for the first time. The essay by 
which these are prefaced is a bit of unrestrained 
eulogy. The claim made for Blake that " No 
one has more clearly understood the relation 
between a decorative design and the space it 
has to fill " is so preposterous as to destroy con- 
fidence in the author's dicta about other phases 
of his art. Miss Gary's book about Mr. 
Whistler's art was so sane that it is surprising 
to find her departing from the firm ground upon 
which she stood in writing that work and falling 
into the error of judging art by the content 
rather than the form. Were " the flaming 
inner soul of invention " the one vital thing in 
art, then Blake's crude drawings would deserve 
the most lavish encomiums. But their appeal 
is to the intellect, leaving the aesthetic sense 
immoved ; and thus they furnish an object- 
lesson for which it would be difficult to find a 
parallel. Frederick W. Gookin. 



Two M:oDER^f Morality Plays.* 



The summer is perhaps not the time when 
one demands of the theatres the highest efforts 
of dramatic genius : the steps of those who stiU 
cleave to the attractions of the town are apt to 
turn to roof-gardens and wonderlands. " One 
whole evening was passed in the rural pleasures 
of Goney Island," says a contemporary letter- 
writer. " I had intended to see ' The Servant

Meltzer. New York : Doubleday, Page & Co.

in the House,' but vulgarity triumphed over 
piety." Many wiU appreciate, perhaps sympa- 
thize with, the action, though few may refer it 
to the same source. But though people do not 
go much to the theatre in the summer, they are 
not averse to talking about the plays they have 
seen during the season. I have, therefore, little 
hesitation in taking an opportunity that offered 
itself some time ago, of writing something about 
two plays that are now subject for literary crit- 
icism, if only by virtue of having appeared in 
paper and print. 

One of these is " The Servant in thp House," 
mentioned by the letter- writer just quoted. This 
play has been widely and favorably advertised 
by the best kind of advertising — namely, the 
admiring word of those who have seen it ; so 
that many who have had no chance to see it 
will have an interest in reading it. Whether 
they will conceive of it (with our friend above 
quoted) as a pious performance, I cannot guess ; 
I rather think that the implication of piety is 
apt to distract the mind from other matters of 
more dramatic import. " Ben Hur," for in- 
stance, " The Ghristian," and whatever may 
have been the next to the last play which 
inspired delighted clergymen to prophesy con- 
cerning the service of the stage to religion, these 
have not made great contributions to the liter- 
ature of our tongue, however much they may 
have added to our piety. 

" The Servant in the House " has one thing 
that a great play shoidd have — namely, a 
noble aim, that of presenting in a form that 
will impress the heart and mind of our genera- 
tion the spirit of Jesus Ghrist as it may appear 
in modern life. This is a thing that some 
people disapprove of and call hard names ; but 
I see no necessity for feeling in any such way. 
It is an aim that has appeared several times in 
recent art with very interesting results ; the 
pictures of Fritz von Uhde, for instance, which 
seem to me very touching and beautifid, as well 
as those of various Frenchmen whose names I 
do not remember. The writers of fiction, how- 
ever, whether in the novel or the drama, have 
not often dealt with the subject, at least not in 
the same way. There have been examples on 
the modern stage, however, and one of them has 
just appeared — a translation of Hauptmann's 
play, " Hannele's Himmelfahrt." 

This play of Hauptmann's I used to think his 
masterpiece. Not having read his work for 
some years, I am not sure but that he may not 
of late have written something better : he is an 
erratic genius, and often produces fine things

THE DIAL 



37 



almost, it would seem, by accident. But 
whether the best of his plays or not, " Hannele " 
is a very beautiful piece, and Mr. Meltzer has 
done well to translate it. The version was made 
fourteen years ago, when " Hannele " was given 
(for a few nights, I believe, perhaps only one) 
in New York, in the presence of its author. I 
have not heard of its being given in English 
since, although the acting rights in America 
belong to Mr. Fiske. Aside from such matters, 
however, it is well to have a translation of the 
play : in the original there is more or less dia- 
lect, as often in Hauptmann, and some other 
difficulties, and many will get a good idea of the 
play who would either find it hard in German 
or else might miss something. Mr. Meltzer's 
work in this case, as well as in " The Sunken 
Bell," is good. One misses the poet's touch 
here and there, but that is inevitable except in 
translations of the highest order. 

" Hannele " is to be mentioned at the same 
time with " The Servant in the House," only 
because each play presents the spirit of Christ 
in modern life, in the person of Christ him- 
self. In " Hannele " he appears in a vision, 
although as the play is developed vision and 
reality so blend into each other that one hardly 
distinguishes between them. In " The Servant 
in the House " ^e appears as a real person. 
The motive is worked out in two very different 
ways, yet each gives a chance to contrast the 
spirit of Christ and the spirit of the world, and 
each gives a chance to see the effect that Jesus 
himself might have on the light of the world, 
were he once more to take human form. 

The great danger, I believe, in all such at- 
tempts is that one will substitute conventional 
sentiment for reality of emotion. This danger 
is one that we may suppose Hauptmann had 
clearly in mind ; for he was in his earlier days 
most noteworthy as a realist. The means by 
which he avoids the difficulty in " Hannele " 
is by presenting the actual facts with absolute 
realism. The almshouse and the paupers, the 
poor sick child and her low father, the school- 
master and the deaconess, — these are actual 
persons, no different from anyone else. The ap- 
pearance of Jesus, of the angels, of the mother, 
though it mingles entirely with the reality, yet 
preserves its own sincerity by having its rise in 
the fevered fancies of the dying child. This is 
a most ingenious means, for as one reads the 
play one accepts readily conventional sentiment, 
even childish fancy, knowing that such are the 
forms in which the spirit of Christ often mani- 
fests itself to-day. Mr. Kennedy deals with the 



problem in a different way : he appears to 
present Jesus as having taken the form of a 
servant and mingling as a man with the actual 
life of a family at a very critical time. This 
is a much more difficult matter than that of 
Hauptmann : in " Hannele " we need never rise 
beyond mans idealizations of Christ ; in " The 
Servant in the House " the author should pre- 
sent to us Christ himself. 

That the greater master should accomplish 
better an easier task, goes without saying. 
" Hannele " has already been given by good 
judges a very high place in the modern drama. 
I believe that a great number who have seen 
" The Servant in the House " will judge that 
Mr. Kennedy has succeeded equally well ; there 
can be but little doubt that as the play appears 
on the stage the impression is strong, powerful, 
very much what the author desired. As one 
reads the play, however, such is by no means 
the case : it will possibly be no concern to the 
author that this should be so ; he wrote for the 
stage and lie has succeeded on the stage. Still 
he has also printed his play, and we may there- 
fore consider it as it comes to us. My own 
view of it may be summarized in a very few 
words, namely, that though intention and idea 
and means are alike fine and well conceived, the 
worked-out result is conventional, sentimental, 
and unreal. That is to say, we have hardly an 
approximation to what Jesus Christ would be 
were he a servant in a modern family, and we 
have no real presentation of the spirit of Christ 
in modern life. 

An English vicar and his wife expect a 
new butler recommended by a friend in India. 
When he appears he bring a new and potent 
element into the life of the vicarage. He 
detects the page in stealing jam ; he vivifies the 
imagination and thoughts of a little girl; he 
condemns a simoniac prince of the church ; he 
arouses to a feeling for the higher socialism a 
low and wretched laboring man ; he restores to 
his better self the vicar who has long been living 
a life he knew was not right ; he even inspires 
a worldly religious woman. Why is not all of 
this well ? Some of it certainly is. Manson's 
dealing with the page-boy and the little girl is 
excellent ; even with the wealthy bishop he is 
good. But I cannot see why in arranging the play 
it was necessary to have all the melodrama of a 
brother who had wronged a brother, a worldly 
woman using religion for her own purposes, a 
church built over a charnel-house, a socialist 
drain-cleaner who shoiild arouse the unfaithful 
vicar to a hectic self-sacrifice. I cannot believe 



38 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



that Jesus would manifest himself most charac- 
teristically in any such surrounding. In fact, 
such a surrounding is most unreal and conven- 
tional : the high-pitched actions of such people 
are merely sentimental fancies. When the vicar 
resolves to put away the superficial religion that 
has made him celebrate the Holy Communion 
in an empty church every morning, and join the 
drain-man in clearing out an old charnel-house 
under the church in spite of the curious danger 
of typhoid that lurks there, when that happens 
in the book (however it be on the stage) one is 
not moved except to vexation at one's disappoint- 
ment. Jesus did not manifest himself, so far 
as we know, in any such piece of melodrama. 
His acts were impressive, but not spectacular. 
He made his striking impressions (if we omit 
cases of disease and possession) on rather ordi- 
nary occasions — on a woman at a well, on a 
woman who had been tried for adultery, on a 
man who wished to talk over theological matters 
with him, or on a man who felt his own crooked 
dealing condemned by Jesus's integrity. And 
these people he impressed, not by righting 
family wrongs or by unveiling official cor- 
ruptions, but by contrasting the selfish person- 
alities in them with the wonderful spirituality 
that was in him. Of course Jesus wished the 
world to be good rather than bad, but his mis- 
sion did not consist merely in telling people to 
be good : it consisted chiefly in showing how 
to be good, and making it possible. Doubtless 
Jesus to-day woidd rebuke the simonist as 
harshly as he did the pharisee ; he would con- 
demn a hard-hearted brother or sister now as 
sternly as he did in his days on earth. But the 
true spirit of Christ does not manifest itself 
most characteristically in these ways. 

The whole thing in a nutshell lies, perhaps, 
in the fact that Manson is not really a servant 
in the house, but a bishop. In fact, the play 
is, or might be, a bit of a masquerade : the 
Bishop of Benares disguises himself as an Indian 
butler, and straightens out the crookednesses of 
an English family. There is no reason for per- 
sonifying Christ : any bishop as clever as the 
Bishop of Benares could certainly have done 
about as well. Nor is Manson a personification 
of Christ, for he has no more resemblance to 
him than many good men in the world, and not 
nearly so much as some. 

All ,this will not lead one to think that Mr. 
Kennedy's play is without interest. It is a fine 
failure, as many other things worth reading have 
been. There is much ingenious and striking 
use of the dramatic means chosen — as in the 



excellent dramatic irony, for instance ; in fact, 
there is quite enough to render the reading of 
the play interesting and amusing. The little 
girl, the rich bishop, are good figures. The 
whole play is impressive on the stage ; at least, 
so everybody says. One may perhaps be satis- 
fied with that : certainly many plays are not 
even so much. Still, when a man really aims 
high, one is naturally anxious that he shall hit 
the mark. Very fine things are rare enough in 
the art of our day ; perhaps Mr. Kennedy will 
accomplish one when he writes another play.

The Versatility op Psychology.* 



The chance that assembles upon the reviewer's 
table a trio of volumes with such distinctive titles 
as " The Animal Mind," " Mind in the Making," 
and " On the Witness Stand " may profitably 
serve to point the moral and adorn the tale of 
the modern psychology of the laboratory. Pro- 
fessor Miinsterberg, the writer of the last- 
mentioned book, finds it pertinent to inform the 
public in regard to the very significant strides 
which Psychology — at once the oldest and the 
youngest of the sciences — has taken under the 
incentive of the modern spirit. " There are 
about fifty psychological laboratories in the 
United States alone. The average educated 
man has hitherto not noticed this. If he chances 
to hear of such places, he fancies that they serve 
for mental healing, or telepathic mysteries, or 
spiritistic performances." It is indeed impor- 
tant that the public should maintain an intel- 
ligent and sympathetic understanding of what 
psychologists are and do and purpose. The 
popular misconception of the trend as of the 
inspiration of such endeavors, that associates it 
with, mystery and an aggressive attack upon the 
supernatural, is nothing short of a calamity ; and 
it is so not mainly because it imposes upon the 
psychologist the discipline of suffering fools 
gladly, but because it deprives him of a ready 
and comprehensive communion with his profes- 
sional colleagues and the wider colleagueship of 
earnest and sturdy students. It will no longer 
do for psychology to plead its infancy and hide 
behind a pinafore. George Eliot has with psy- 
chological mastery po rtrayed the dangers of a

career that earns the epithet of "so young." 
No more effective method of coming to its own 
can be prescribed for psychology than on the 
one hand to assume fearlessly the reconstruction 
of the domain that it rightly commands, and 
again to assert its practical bearing upon the 
issues that engage thoughtful men. It is not 
only strange, as Professor Miinsterberg remarks, 
it is equally unfortunate, " that this whole won- 
derful development should have gone on in com- 
plete detachment from the problems of practical 
life." 

The task of the theorist and the practitioner 
must be re-stated, to meet the needs of each 
progressive generation. The comment is an old 
one, that Providence did not first fashion man 
as he was and then leave it to Aristotle to make 
him logical. Mankind has ever held and will 
ever hold all sorts and conditions of opinions in 
regard to the ways of mind ; and the psychol- 
ogist's instructions must be content to shape the 
susceptible habits of the cultivated, and that too 
in modest measure. It truly has not been left 
for the psychologist to make man psychological. 
He is so because the whole realm of the mind 
touches deeply his natural interests. It is the 
privilege and the duty of psychology to guide 
these interests wisely, to free them of supersti- 
tions and misleading accretions, to inform them 
with the sterling issues of sound evidence, to 
enlighten practice with a reverent hesitation and 
yet not enfeeble it with the pale cast of helpless 
erudition. 

The attitude of man toward the mental 
qualities of the animal world offers a suggestive 
criterion of his status as a psychologist when 
thrown upon his impulses and chastened by the 
logic of experience. It was a natural appercep- 
tion of the animal mind to make it the vehicle 
of the moral fable. The primitive man feels 
his kinship with the other denizens of creation, 
and envies each for a distinctive quality. We 
still use animal epithets as the most effective 
appraisals and disparagements of strength and 
frailty alike. The difficulty arises when the 
scientific conscience is bom, and fact and fable 
must be held wide apart. It makes all sorts of 
tronble when the modern ^sop sends his narra- 
tive to the Society for Comparative Psychology, 
and the crime of nature-faking is recognized in 
the revised decalogue. The constant and irre- 
sistible temptation remains to read into animal 
behavior the motives and mental equipment 
that accompany oiir own actions. To give a 
critically objective account of what a favorite 
domestic pet really did is an exercise not to be 



lightly prescribed ; and the psychologist has 
slowly but determinedly learned to look aside 
from the " anecdotage " of animal sagacity for 
his data. The laboratory dominates the spirit 
of inquiry, and after a score of years of patient 
research founded upon discerning and expert 
analyses makes possible such a survey as Miss 
Washburn of Vassar College presents in her 
volume on " The Animal Mind." It is indeed 
the first compilation dominated by this perspec- 
tive, and renders accessible to student as well 
as to the studious layman the kind of data, the 
critical interpretation of results, and the source 
of the guiding principles, that in the modern 
view are likely to bring some systematic under- 
standing of animal psychology. 

Mental life implies some form of responsive- 
ness to the forces resident in the environment, 
which in turn is evidenced by a change of 
behavior ; while, concomitantly, we know that 
there goes on in ourselves some reflective process 
and we assume a more or less distant analogical 
counterpart thereof in the lowlier organisms 
according to their nearness of kin. The tech- 
nique necessary to establish the varieties of 
sensory experience from amoeba to chimpanzee 
is quite impressive, the interpretations in even 
the lowly creatures quite perplexing. The 
complex behavior of wasps invites the most 
individualistic interpretation ; and yet, while 
any old-fashioned reference to instinct is ruled 
out of court, the psychologist retains the con- 
viction of an underlying consistency of stages of 
behavior, if only the clue thereto could be dis- 
covered. The proper mode of facilitating this 
discovery is to subject normal animals to definite 
situations and see what they do, and how they 
fail, and what is presumably implied in their 
actions. Yet Nature is not to be ignored, and 
the reactions must at once proceed upon the 
basis of a real desire, and involve in their solu- 
tion activities of a kind provided by the animal 
equipment. Susceptibility to training is not 
the sole criterion of intelligence. The natur- 
alist still puts forth the startling diversities of 
behavior that come from observation, and 
freshly challenges the experimentalist to offer 
an interpretation. The whole situation is an 
admirable example of the value of logic ; and 
in this arena, and with such weapons, must the 
conflict be waged. It is a notable triumph of 
the experimental psychologist to have carried 
the issue to these terms and to have made his 
own a territory imperfectly occupied by the 
naturalist. In the course of this procedure he 
has clarified the significance of mental functions

when reduced to their lowest terms, — a result 
that generations of less definitely guided re- 
search would have sought for in vain. 

Such, really, is mind in the making. Yet 
each has an individual mind to shape to adult 
efficiency ; and once more psychology steps in 
with another type of equipment to lure unwill- 
ing data from their hidden source. Thfi psy- 
chology of the human animal in its maturing 
stages is a sore temptation to the easy-going 
theorist; he often exhibits a remarkable digestion 
for haK-baked hypotheses that would stagger 
a devotee of sterner sciences more accustomed 
to the regulated diet of a reflective, even a 
ruminating, constitution. Experimental peda- 
gogues have somewhat mistaken the character of 
the advice to prove all things. In no realm is 
the experimental path more thickly set with 
snares for the unwary ; out of the mouths of 
ambitious doctors' theses has emerged wisdom 
that deduces the curriculum, banishes supersti- 
tion, squares the circle of our perplexities, and 
proclaims formula for the salvation of the 
future. In spite of exaggeration and misunder- 
standing, pedagogical practice has a vital con- 
nection with the psychology of the laboratory ; 
and Professor Swift's book on " Mind in the 
Making " may be cited as an example of ration- 
ally interpreted experience through which such 
lessons achieve a worthy status. The psychology 
of learning is a procedure to be illuminated by 
varieties of tests and is in turn a common factor 
of the animal and the human mind. The close 
dependence of mental deficiencies upon nervous 
impairment is again to be determined in the 
spirit of the clinician. The wayward instincts 
of boys — in their exaggeration the beginnings 
of crime — are to be interpreted in the light of 
evolutionary status. The nature of ability, as 
concretely tested in this or that type of acquisi- 
tion, illuminates the central issue of general 
versus special talent. And so, one by one, the 
more concrete and the more comprehensive 
questions of the applying psychologist are 
reviewed in this collection of essays ; and each 
brings a tangible addition to the insight that 
can assimilate data while it yet directs their 
accumulation and dominates their interpreta- 
tion. By some such slow and measured accre- 
tion will psychology infuse into pedagogical 
inquiry the caution and the spirit of its own 
advances. 

But the schoolroom is not life. Has psychol- 
ogy anything to say to the active practitioner ? 
No severer test of the issues could be set than 
to brine: them to court. This Professor Miin- 



sterberg does in his volume entitled " On the 
Witness Stand " ; and he does it with a bold- 
ness that invites admiration not unmixed with 
concern. We are all seekers of truth, and the 
measure of success of our search is ever pro- 
nounced upon by judges, — the criticism of our 
peers, the approval of the many. The bench 
and the collective acumen of twelve jurymen 
stand as the machinery for bringing to light the 
legal truth. Here enters the psychology of decep- 
tion : what if the witness lies, and the defendant 
denies his guilt ! Upon this issue of credibility, 
psychology has an authoritative voice ; and how 
little or how much one may sympathise with 
Professor Miinsterberg's methods and conclu- 
sions, one may unhesitatingly approve his em- 
phasis of attention to the problem as a psycho- 
logical one. If once we look at the matter apart 
from tradition, there is really nothing fore- 
ordained or inspired in the accidental assemblage 
of twelve citizens that gives to their verdict 
any unusual status, especially upon this ever- 
recurring issue of credibility. 

The pertinent data begin with the establish- 
ment of the treacherous character of memory 
and the liability to malobservation under the 
most sincere desire to judge rightly. These are 
distinct issues presenting conditions of labora- 
tory study. The great variability of testimony, 
when the objective circumstances are carefully 
noted by one specifically detailed for such pur- 
pose, is indeed striking. Experimental crimin- 
ology has gone so far as to precipitate into an 
academic scene a sudden brawl, with the flash 
of a pistol, and the consequent command of the 
professor that all shall prepare for use at the 
trial a careful statement of what had occurred. 
At the next session of the seminary it is revealed 
that the whole situation was prearranged, that 
such are the facts, and lo ! the deviating reports. 
So much for the imintentional swerving from 
truth. Next comes the psychology of prejudice, 
of expectation, of desire, of interest These are 
not neglected in the popular appraisal of testi- 
mony ; and upon these issues definite experi- 
ment if judiciously conducted has an illuminating 
value. But the psychology of deception forms 
the keystone of many a legal arch. The tell-tale 
of the emotions ; the hesitations of a conscience ; 
the entanglements of fabrication, — will these 
reveal their secret ? Assuredly not always ; 
though credibility is constantly judged in terms 
of just these revelations. It is at this stage that 
Professor Miinsterberg offers a distinct test that 
shall circumvent the deceit of the witness and 
reveal guilt. Instead of an ordeal of mediaeval

stupidity or brutality, a refined and insinuating 
method is introduced by which the defendant 
goes through a series of associations to set words, 
the time needed to call up the first suitable re- 
sponse being noted. Most of the words are 
innocent ; but here and there are introduced 
words that have a bearing upon the crime. The 
result shows delays, irregularities, hesitations at 
these points. This is but one type of psycho- 
logical record ; but it may stand as a fair sample. 
What importance shall the court lay upon such 
findings ? 

While approving the pertinence of raising 
this issue, psychologists and jurists alike will 
exhibit considerable hesitation in attaching to 
the method the high practical availability that 
is here supported. Indeed, some will openly say 
that this is a crude application of a hasty gen- 
eralization, itself open to error and influenced 
by accidental vagaries ; that it smacks of the 
astrologer, the phrenologist, and the palmist, all 
of whom had ready formulae for reading char- 
acter and discovering human faculty. It is to 
be regretted that the mode of stating the case 
gives more plausibility to these protests than 
they intrinsically merit. But while it cannot be 
said that psychology is altogether ready to solve 
the problems concerned as they concretely arise, 
and that it is very desirable to avoid sensational- 
ism and the too confident heralding of panaceas, 
yet above all the message of Professor Miinster- 
berg's book is that psychology really has and 
should have something to say on these topics ; 
and that message, however much we may object 
to the words in which it is couched, is worthy 
of consideration. 

A specific question remains : whether psy- 
chology does not furnish a means of so altering 
the mental status as to induce a condition in 
which deceit and perjury are impossible. Why 
not hypnotise the suspect to get the whole truth 
and nothing but the truth? And once more, 
may not the crime have been committed while 
the defendant was in condition of hypnotic irre- 
sponsibility ? And again, assume that a con- 
fession has been secured : is it beyond question 
that the confession is genuine, not induced 
through suggestion? These are all very real 
and very perplexing situations to which a cate- 
gorical yes or no cannot be hastily rendered. 
Professor Miinsterberg discusses them with 
much insight ; and they, along with the other 
situations, indicate that sooner or later the pro- 
ceedings of court must take into account some 
of the knowledge that is emerging from the 
psychological laboratory. 



The versatility of psychology is equally its 
danger. Sciences should present determinable 
though not invariable contours, — should have 
loyalties of allegiance and constitutions under 
which their policies and measures are formu- 
lated. The science of the mind participates in 
the descriptive insight that makes the good 
observer, and finds its material in the wide, 
wide world. It must also be normative, for lives 
must be regulated ; and the perplexities of 
motives, impulses, and ideals that go to the 
regidation of our far from simple life will fur- 
nish incentive for the further pursuit of this 
comprehensive discipline, allied by traditions 
with the oldest of the humanities, by precept 
and example with the historical unfoldment of 
civilization, by its modern reconstruction with 
the logic of science and the ingenuity of experi- 
mental device. Joseph Jastrow. 



The Stuarts in Exile.* 



Of all the unfortunate dynasties of modem 
times, none has suffered adversity in greater 
measure than the family of the Stuarts. From 
the terrible rout at Solway Moss, in 1542, to 
the merciless slaughter at Culloden Moor in 
1746, its history is a record of almost continuous 
disaster: the lonely death of broken-hearted 
James V.; the long journey to the scaffold of 
his daughter, Mary Stuart ; the ignominious 
death of her grandson Charles I. and the exile 
of his wife and children ; the second exile of 
James II.; the long pathetic " reign " of the 
landless James III.; the wasted life of the 
"Young Pretender"; and the final extinction 
of the male line with the death of the Cardinal 
of York, — these events, with their attendant 
circumstances, form a series of tragedies that 
probably have no parallel in history. 

No doubt it is this tragic element in the career 
of the Stuart dynasty that appeals so powerfully 
to a certain class of historical students ; perhaps, 
also, the fact that the hostility which always 
rose where a Stuart ruled has continued after 
them. Historians have not always dealt fairly 
with these kings : Macaulay's treatment may 
serve as an illustration. But whatever the 
reason, interest in Stuart history still continues 
and shows no sign of abatement. Among the 
new books in this field are two notable studies 
in the closing act of the Stuart drama — the

exile of James II. and his family, and the vain 
efforts of the " Pretenders " to regain the 
British crowns. A few years ago Mr. Martin 
Haile developed a natural interest in " The Old 
Chevalier " while preparing a biography of 
Queen Mary of Modena, the Chevalier's mother. 
Mr. Andrew Lang, on the other hand, dis- 
covered the possibilities of such a study while 
tracing the career of the Chevalier's son. Prince 
Charles Edward Stuart. However, " The King 
over the Water " seems to be mainly the work 
of Miss Alice Shield, Mr. Lang's part being 
limited, as he tells us, to supervision and con- 
densation. 

When authors write on the same theme, and 
draw to a large extent from the same sources, 
their work will naturally show many points of 
similarity. In the present instance this is 
strikingly true : in both biographies we have the 
same favorable picture of the Old Pretender, — 
they reveal to us the gentle, pious, sympathetic 
prince, the very antithesis to the coarse profligate 
that Thackeray describes in Henry Esmond ; 
but they also prove that James was a man of 
considerable ability and undoubted personal 
courage, facts that earlier historians, relying on 
the statements of an anonymous opponent, have 
been disposed to deny. Both writers have shown 
clearly the importance of the Stuart pretensions 
as a factor in eighteenth-century diplomacy. 
Almost every court in continental Europe seems 
to have joined, at some time or other, in 
treaties or plots that aimed at a Stuart restora- 
tion ; and the biographers have both tried to 
tell the story of these intrigues with considerable 
fulness — too much so, perhaps, to ensure a 
sustained interest on the reader's part. 

But there are also notable differences in the 
books. Miss Shield is interested in the human 
side of her subject, and gives us a delightful 
picture of every-day life at Saiat Germains and 
Urbino ; her work is primarily a biography. 
Mr. Haile, on the other hand, deals more with 
James as pretender to the English crown, with 
diplomatic intrigues and Jacobite plots. On 
these points his researches seem to have been 
thorough and complete ; but on many other 
matters he appears to have contented himself 
with a priori deductions — as, for instance, 
when he tells us that James III. was proclaimed 
at the palace gates of Saint Germains " under 
the title of King of England, Scotland, and 
Ireland, the title of King of France being for 
obvious reasons omitted." The reasons do seem 
obvious enough ; but Miss Shield, who seems to 
have investigated the matter, asser<"s positively 



that the Stuarts, even after they had been 
reduced to financial dependence on Louis XIV., 
refused to renounce the French title, and that 
James was proclaimed king of France as well 
as of Britain. 

The authors have also found it necessary to 
discuss a number of historical problems of gen- 
eral interest, and on some of these most inter- 
esting conclusions have been reached. Histo- 
rians have always suspected that William of 
Orange was closely connected with the move- 
ments preliminary to the Revolution of 1688 ; 
but perhaps none has seen the revolution as Mr. 
HaUe views it — a vast conspiracy, conceived, 
planned, and engineered by the Prmce himself. 
Mr. Haile is also sure that James II. was abso- 
lutely honest, and had nothing but the cause of 
religious toleration at heart, when he issued the 
Declaration of Indulgence. Louis XIV. is shown 
to have been not entirely unselfish in his efforts 
to restore James ; he was willing that he should 
rule again in Scotland and Ireland, but not in 
England. Even as early as 1694, the Jacobite 
party, Mr. Haile believes, "was many times 
more numerous than had been the Orange faction 
in 1688." The failure of James he attributes 
to the lack of adequate resources. The biog- 
raphers both emphasize Queen Anne's aversion 
for the House of Hanover ; and Mr. Haile, with 
his usual easy positiveness, states his belief that 
in 1712 the Queen was actually taking steps 
toward a restoration of her nephew to the British 
thrones. The story that James proved such a dis- 
appointment to the Scots in 1715 is discredited ; 
perhaps he was the one who was most disap- 
pointed. At the same time it seems evident that 
a heart-sick and ague-stricken Parisian youth 
was hardly the person to accomplish anything 
heroic in the winter-locked Highlands. It is 
interesting to learn that in 1718 representatives 
of such hostile monarchs as Charles XII. and 
Peter the Great met in secret conference to dis- 
cuss joint action in favor of a Stuart restoration, 
" and their negotiations continued until broken 
off by the death of Charles XII." The imfor- 
tunate quarrel between James and his consort, 
Queen Clementina, which alienated so much 
Jacobite support in England (1725), is attri- 
buted by Mr. Haile, on what seems reliable 
evidence, to the influence of Walpole's gold. 
Cardinal Alberoni acting as agent. The same 
influence is seen in the negotiations preliminary 
to the rising in "Forty-five," with the same 
decisive results. 

Except in the case of the " Young Pretender," 
the attitude toward the members of the exiled

family is in both instances one of sympathy. 
Miss Shield's estimates are, however, the more 
critical and satisfactory ; she is able to see that 
Mary of Modena, though an excellent woman, 
was a poor politician, and that James III. would 
probably not have made a great ruler. The 
reader is therefore hardly prepared for the poetic 
eulogy that follows the account of James's 
funeral and forms the closing paragraph of the 
work. 

" All was over that was mortal. The old song was 
sung; the last drama of the awful Stuart cycle was 
played out. The cause and its glory remained a banquet- 
hall deserted, whose lights were fled, whose garlands 
dead, and all but a httle few and a mournful memory 
departed. But that few — and that memory! Green 
as the unfading pines of the Highland glens, that 
memory lives forever. And for that few! — We fools 
esteemed their life madness and their end to be utter 
destruction, but they are numbered among the heroes 
of all time. They stood with great constancy against 
those that afflicted them, and made no accoimt of their 
sufferings, and they shone as sparks among the stubble 
of their sordid, self-seeking age. As gold in the fur- 
nace were they proved, and in time there has come 
respect to them." 

No doubt many of the Jacobites did suffer and 
suffered heroically ; but general praise like the 
above is not merited. In the story of the 
movements for Stuart restoration, self-interest 
figures to an amazing extent. The Stuart 
cause was too often used as a handy weapon 
with which to strike down an opponent. And 
though the use of this weapon often brought 
the wielder to poverty and exile, and even to 
the scaffold, his career is on that account not 
necessarily heroic. The Stuart partisans strove 
against the overpowering forces of history, and 
these are as merciless as they are mighty.

Tactics and Xo defend the military reputation of 

Getty sburu "Jeb" Stuart, the Confederate cav- 

campaif/n. airy general, Colonel John T. Mosby, 

the famous partisan leader, has written a book 
entitled " Stuart's Cavalry in the Gettysburg Cam- 
paign" (Moffat, Yard & Co.). Colonel Mosby 
objects to the assertion of Lee's biographers, and 
other writers, that Lee's objective when he left 
Frederick City was Gettysburg, and that he planned 
to fight there a decisive battle ; that there was a race 
between the two opposing armies for the possession 
of Gettysburg, and that Lee lost because Stuart 
with his cavalry was careering about the country 
out of touch with the army and not fiu-nishing the 
commander-in-chief with information about the 
movements of the Federals. Mosby maintains that 



Lee, by invading Pennsylvania, meant merely to 
draw Hooker out of Virginia, and thereby to de- 
range for the year the Federal plan of campaign, 
and perhaps also to relieve the pressure in the 
Southwest by causing the withdrawal of troops to 
the North ; that Stuart did not neglect the duty of 
supplying information, but was doing what Lee had 
ordered him to do ; that there was no race to reach 
Gettysburg, for Lee had not intended to go there; 
that he had planned to fight at Cashtown Pass, if 
at all ; and that his plans were frustrated by Heth 
and Hill, who blundered into a fight at Gettysburg 
when ordered to make only a reconnoissance. The 
author thinks that Lee had set a trap into which 
Hooker was about to fall ; that Lee wanted him to 
come out of Virginia, and either get so far into 
Pennsylvania that the Confederate army might turn 
and make a forced march on Washington, or if he 
should divide his army Lee would then endeavor to 
destroy it in detail. Meade's succession to the com- 
mand of the Federal army upset some of Lee's 
calculations, for Meade was not so easily handled 
as Hooker had been. Of the battle of Gettysburg, 
there is no account in this book. It cannot be said 
that Colonel Mosby proves all his points ; but he 
does prove some of them, and throws new light on 
others. Only slight literary skill is displayed, and 
the arrangement of the matter is anything but com- 
mendable. The entire book of 220 pages has only 
two chapters, and the arrangement of foot-notes is 
execrable — in many places it is difficult to tell 
whether a quotation belongs in a foot-note or in the 
text ; sometimes a passage begins as a note and 
ends as a part of the text, producing a most confus- 
ing effect. The author's style is over-argumentative, 
and too often he says disrespectful things of Lee's 
staff officers who are responsible for the generally 
accepted views as to Lee's intentions. There is much 
repetition of argument, some mistakes of memory as 
to names, and too profuse quotation from the Official 
Records. The work shows, however, that the author 
has made a thorough study of military science as 
bearing on his subject.

their respective purposes admirably. Naturally,

defect, however, may not be felt very strongly, inas- 
much as the American who is interested in " Dante 
as a Lyric Poet " is often glad to hear about " Thirty 
Years of Italian Progress." While the reviewer 
may have enjoyed most the chapters on Cardinal 
Hohenlohe and " Italy in 1907," many of his readers 
might easily prefer " Venetian Legends and Pa- 
geants," or some of the literary essays. When Mr. 
Thayer is dealing with contemporary conditions in 
the Italian peninsula, we find ourselves in hearty 
accord with his views. Despite the agrarian prob- 
lems in the South, the nation has every right to be 
optimistic as it surveys the progress of the last thirty 
years : in an entirely new sense, the way of hope 
lies open. When Mr. Thayer deals with questions 
touching the Papacy and Clericalism, he is laudably 
outspoken ; and here again we are thoroughly in 
sympathy with his attitude. In the literary essays 
we could find points that are open to respectful 
criticism. For instance, in his readable chapter on 
Carducci there is a tone of complaint that this great 
author has been unduly neglected outside of Italy. 
In an important sense, this is hardly true ; for the 
very merits of that really eminent lyric poet bind 
him more or less closely to his own nation, and his 
message might have been fraught with less mean- 
ing for Italy if it had been more general. On 
the whole, however, the reflections and verdicts 
recorded in the volume are such as we should 
expect from a student and critic of Mr. Thayer's 

standing. 

Newiiahtan ^ ^o"? expected work on Stellar 
the problems of Evolution, by Dr. George E. Hale, 
stellar evolution. Director of the Mount WHson Solar 
Observatory in California, has finally been issued by 
the University of Chicago Press. It is not a treatise 
on the general subject of stellar evolution, but 
rather chiefly a popular description of certain phases 
of astrophysical research — illustrated largely by 
investigations and experiments made by Dr. Hale 
and his assistants — which bear upon the problem 
of the development of the starry universe. The 
book contains twenty-five chapters, of about ten 
pages apiece ; a third of them consist of descriptions 
and discussions of instruments. Some of these in- 
struments have been in use at the Yerkes Observa- 
tory, of which the author was formerly Director, 
and others are being built for service at Mount 
WUson. The reader gets a new idea of the refine- 
ments of modern astronomical research, when he is 
told that a great reflecting telescope, the mirror of 
which is sixty inches in diameter, is to be maintained 
at an even teraperatTire throughout the day by the 
use of suitable refrigerating machinery ; the building 
in which this optical giant is to be sheltered will be 
shielded from the direct rays of the sun, and so 
constructed that no outside air can enter during the 
day. The necessity for such precautions becomes 
apparent as one learns that when the mirror was 
being ground to the true paraboloidal figure tests 
were made which would reveal irregularities of 
figure as large as one five hundred thousandth of 



an inch. It is impossible in a short notice to give 
an adequate idea of the contents of a book which 
discusses subjects ranging from "The Nebular 
Hypothesis " down to " Opportunities for Amateur 
Observers." Of the nebular hypothesis the author 
concludes that " Laplace's idea of the development 
of the solar system must be reconstructed or aban- 
doned." To the planetesimal hypothesis of the 
evolution of our system, which has recently been 
formulated by Chamberlin and Moulton, an entire 
chapter has been given. At the end of Dr. Hale's 
interesting and valuable work are upward of a hun- 
dred full-page plates, among which are some fine 
representations of solar phenomena and of notable 
nebulae ; the majority of them are, however, of novel 
instruments. The volume is an excellent example 
of fine workmanship in the art of bookmaking. 



Scandinavian Modern-language texts for college 
texts, annotated Students have multiplied of late years 
in English. ^t such a rate that a large part of 

the best continental literature has been made avail- 
able in this annotated form. Hitherto, material of 
this sort has been confined to the four chief culture 
languages — German, French, Italian, and Spanish. 
Scandinavian texts, hitherto unrepresented, are now 
beginning to take their place with those of the other 
languages, and the John Anderson Publishing Co., 
Chicago, is doing useful pioneer work in this direc- 
tion. Three years ago, this house issued a text of 
BjOrnson's " SynnOve Solbakken," admirably edited 
by Professor George T. Flom ; and now we have 
from the same source no less a work than Ibsen's 
" Brand," no less admirably edited by Professor 
Julius E. Olson. In this case, the editor is a pioneer 
also ; for he has been the fii'st scholar in any country 
to undertake the difficult and perplexing task of 
supplying "• Brand " with annotations, and they are 
almost as much needed by Norwegian as by Amer- 
ican students. We are very grateful for this edition. 
In the first place, it supplies us with an accurate 
text, and corrects many errors that have crept even 
into the Minde Udgave of Ibsen's works. In the 
second place, it offers a very valuable explanatory 
introduction, based upon a comprehensive survey of 
all the sources of information making particular use 
of the material offered by Jaeger, Brandes, Herford, 
and the Ibsen letters, and presenting what seems to 
us a saner and more balanced view of the work than 
has elsewhere been published. In the third place, 
it gives us about seventy pages of notes that clear 
away many difficulties, and provide the reader with 
an indispensable help to the study of the poem. 
Besides all this, it prints as an appendix Ibsen's 
verses "Till de Medskyldige," which preface the 
'* Brand-Fragment " of nearly two hundred stanzas, 
recently unearthed, and published only a few months 
ago. A few sentences from Professor Olson's Intro- 
duction may be quoted to illustrate his appreciation 
of the work which he has edited with so much 
painstaking. " ' Brand ' is the great central fact 
of Ibsen's life and authorship. . . . The accidental

theme in hand related to the moral status of his 
countrymen in an international situation. But the 
fundamental idea of the drama was plucked from 
his own heart. It was written in a spirit of sheer 
necessity to clarify his own thoughts, — to cleanse 
his own soul. ... It was written at a time when 
Ihsen's mind was in a strange ferment, — a time of 
terrific storm and stress. ... In this state of mind, 
he sought and found refuge in literary production — 
in taking under stern literary chastisement a char- 
acter like himself and allowing him to follow the 
bent of his intense soul to the limits. . . . It is a 
prime artistic virtue of ' Brand ' that it inspires the 
reader with a kindred heroic spirit." 

The familiar The problem of Rousseau's life and 
problem of opinions is always fascinating — for 

Rousseau. ^^g reason, because it is impossible to 

solve. It is obscured by inconsistencies and contra- 
dictions, by the apparent yet doubtful frankness of 
amazing confessions, and by the delusions of a dis- 
ordered mind. There is, too, so much in the life 
of Rousseau that is likely to bias the investigator, 
both for and against, that he is liable to become 
either a special pleader or a criminal prosecutor. In 
M. Jules Lemaitre's book on Rousseau (McClure) 
we have the interesting phenomenon of a converted 
anti-Rousseauite treating the object of his new 
faith. Yet he has not the blind devotion of the 
proselyte. He retains enough of the old disbelief 
to give sanity to his judgment and gains enough love 
and insight to expound his subject with enthusiasm. 
His method consists in bringing out by liberal quo- 
tation the principles which Rousseau developed in 
his works, and in showing from the events of his life 
of what diverse elements this curious genius was 
compounded. The lectures which form the sub- 
stance of the volume do not pretend to be a philo- 
sophical treatise, but they give a good idea of what 
Rousseau thought and did. They are written in a 
free-and-easy style, and are rather familiar talks 
than formal addresses. The translation by Mme. 
Charles Bigot (Jeanne Mairot) has some un-English 
words and constructions, but is on the whole pleas- 
ing and is never obscure. 

Confessions of " 'E'^evy newspaper office," declares 
a reformed Mr. William Salisbury in his " Career 

journalist. of a Journalist" (B. W. Dodge&Co.), 

"is a school of cynicism"; and his pages breathe, 
throughout, a spirit of cynical contempt for his for- 
mer calling and for himself for having engaged in 
it. Signed statements, he tells us, were the rage 
with Mr. Hearst's newspapers, on one of which he 
was for a short time employed as reporter, and more 
than one such statement he freely acknowledges him- 
self to have fabricated, the ostensible author seeing 
it for the first time in print, with his own name 
under it. These statements, it is further explained, 
owed their inspiration to no higher source than a 
city directory, a near-by resort where certain liquids 
were sold, and a vivid and fertile imagination. For 
so young a person — he speaks of himself as nineteen 



in 1895 — this ex-journalist has had an astonishing 
experience of disillusionment, of sobering disen- 
chantment, and sad realization that behind the glit- 
ter and glamour of much that dazzles the eyes of 
youth there lies nothing more substantial than the 
shadow of a foolish dream. With a really enviable 
command of fluent and forcible English, he tells 
us in his concluding chapter : " I have seen joy and 
sorrow hold the stage in high life and low life. I 
have seen many glorious pageants in the world's 
greatest cities, and I have reported more funerals 
than I can remember. ... I have watched victims 
of tragedies give their dying gasps, and h^ard the 
wails of newly made widows and orphans." And 
so on, at some length. A style subdued to what it 
so long has worked in contributes no little to the 
surface charm of Mr. Salisbury's rattling tale — or 
"story," as it must, in a journalistic sense, be called. 
The sort of journalism in which he was engaged 
was certainly, according to his account, an ignoble 
pursuit ; and his book may serve a useful purpose 
as a warning and example — while not necessarily 
discouraging to those having the qualifications and 
ambition for legitimate and honorable newspaper 

work. 

A racy account '/With the Border Ruffians "(Dutton) 
of border-life is an interesting book, whether re- 
sixtv years ago. goxdieA as a mere story, as autobiog- 
raphy, or as a description of bygone social conditions. 
The author, Mr. R. H. Williams, was a roving En- 
glishman, who came to the United States in 1852 
in search of fortune and adventure. He spent two 
years in the mountains of whait is now the southern 
border of West Virginia, four years in Kansas ter- 
ritory during the border troubles, and eight years 
on the Texas frontier during and after the Civil 
War. In 1868 he returned to England, settled 
down to a quiet life, and eventually became a justice 
of the peace. He wrote out his American journal 
in 1902, but its publication has been deferred until 
now. The style of the book is colloquial and with- 
out pretense of literary finish, but is lively enough 
to hold the attention of the most listless reader. 
Historical allusions are somewhat careless and in- 
accm'ate, but the description of social conditions at 
the three points upon the margin of civilization, 
where the writer lived, is unsurpassed. The title 
is misleading in that it gives the impression that the 
book deals chiefly with the Kansas conflict. Only 
a small part relates to that subject, but this part is 
interesting as a reflection of pro-slavery prejudices 
and point of view. More than two-thirds of the 
whole deals with the Texas period, and gives vivid 
pictures of ranch life, Indian raids, and bushwhack- 
ing, during the Civil War. Especially important is 
the light the book throws upon the cruelty and 
corruption of the Confederate service upon the 
frontier. There is no apparent good reason why 
the author should have felt so strong a call to de- 
fend Southern rights, but like many young men at 
the outbreak of the war he mistook a love of excite- 
ment for patriotism.

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A volume of " Aphorisms and Reflections," selected 
from the writings of T. H. Huxley by his widow, is pub- 
lished by The Macmillan Co. Huxley was one of the 
meatiest of writers, and bears well this somewhat search- 
ing test of the quality of his thought. An elaborate 
index makes this little book a veritable boon to the 
literary worker in need of apt illustrative quotations. 
Huxley's range was so wide that no seeker is likely to 
close the book quite empty-handed. 

" The Appreciation of Music," by Messrs. Thomas 
Whitney Surette and Daniel Gregory Mason, is pub- 
lished "by the Baker & Taylor Co. in a series which 
already includes volimaes upon the appreciation of liter- 
ature and other forms of art. It presents " in clear 
and untechnical language an account of the evolution 
of musical art from the primitive folk-song up to the 
symphony of Beethoven," illustrating the stages of this 
development by musical examples, and providing 
detailed analyses of many typical compositions. The 
volume has several portrait illustrations. 

Messrs E. P. Button & Co. are the publishers of a 
series of small books collectively entitled " The Wisdom 
of the East." The general editorship of these books 
(ten in number) is in the hands of Mr. L. Cranmer- 
Byng and Dr. S. A. Kapadia. The special editing is 
also in competent hands, for we note such names as those 
of Professor L. D. Bamett, Mr. Lionel Giles, and others. 
Three of the volumes are given to Confucius, one to the 
Chinese mystic Chuang Tzu, two to the Persians, two to 
the Arabs, one to the Vedanta philosophy, and one to the 
teachings of Buddha. They appear to be excellent little 
books, combining text and comimentary in a useful way, 
and well calculated to popularize the religious philo- 
sophies of the Asiatic world. 

The book-lover (in all senses of the term) will find 
his account in a volume upon Horace, which comes to 
us in a limited edition from the Elm Tree Press, 
Woodstock, Vermont, and is edited by Messrs. Charles 
Loomis Dana and John Cotton Dana. It is essentially 
a volume of illustrative examples of the Roman poet, 
given in English translations selected from the bewilder- 
ing variety of versions that are at hand for choice. The 
translations range all the way from Cowley and Dryden 
to Mr. Austin Dobson and Mr. Roswell Field, and are 
classified according to subject. Besides these, the 
volume contains a group of interesting essays upon 
Horatian themes, such as the friends, the loves, the 
education, and the religion of the poet. Last of all, 
there are about thirty judiciously-chosen illustrations. 
The volume is delightful to view and to handle, and 
there can be no doubt concerning the warmth of the 
welcome it will get from all true Horatians. 



Notes. 



A new school edition of the first six books of the 
" iEneid " comes to us from Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & 
Co. It IS the work of Messrs. H. R. Fairclough and 
Seldon L. Brown, and is equipped for student use with 
a very comprehensive modern apparatus. 

Two posthumous papers by " Ouida," dealing with 
matters of especial interest to women, are to be pub- 
lished, so saith report, in " Lippincott's Magazine " with 
the fall of the leaf. The Lippincott vaults have held 



the manuscripts for several years, agreement having 
been made that these late products of the romancer's 
pen should see the light only after her death. It is 
expected that they will create something of a sensation. 
" The Witchcraft Delusion in Colonial Connecticut," 
by Mr. John M. Taylor, is an interesting addition to 
the Grafton Historical Series, published at the Grafton 
Press. The work is prepared directly from the sources, 
and constitutes an authoritative addition to our colonial 
history. 

With its July number, " The Forum " reverts from 
the quarterly method of publication to its original plan 
of monthly issue. Fiction will hereafter be admitted, 
the opening chapters of Mr. Joseph Conrad's new serial, 
" The Point of Honor," being published in the July 
number. 

The Messrs. Scribner import for the American market 
a volume of selected poems by Carducci, translated and 
appreciatively prefaced by Miss Maud Holland. The 
Italian text faces the pages of translation, which gives 
the book an additional interest. We wish only that 
there were more of it. 

From the Columbia University Press we have a study, 
by Mrs. Juliana Haskell, of " Bayard Taylor's Transla- 
tion of Goethe's Faust." The writer is mainly concerned 
to inquire whether the translation may be considered an 
English poem, and her conclusion is a decided negative. 
In this we think she is right, however much we may 
admire the scholarship and the painstaking fidelity of 
Taylor's version. 

Mr. Stanley Paul, for the past six years manager of 
the publishing house of Messrs. Hutchinson & Co., 
London, has recently embarked in business on his own 
accoimt, with offices in Clifford's Inn, Fleet Street. It 
is Mr. Paul's intention to devote particular attention to 
the exploitation of American books m the British and 
Colonial markets, and he is desirous of making arrange- 
ments with American authors and publishers toward 
that end. 

Legal protection for correspondence against unauthor- 
ized publication has long been felt to be a desideratum. 
The recent Publishers' Congress at Madrid expressed 
the wish that each country there represented should by 
formal legislation declare all letters to be literary pro- 
perty and protected by the laws relating to literary 
property in general, and therefore not legally publishable 
without the consent of both parties to the correspondence, 
their heirs or assigns. 

Professor J. E. Spingarn has edited, and the Oxford 
Clarendon Press has published, two volumes of " Criti- 
cal Essays of the Seventeenth Century." Dryden alone 
does not appear, since his critical writings may be had 
in the admirable edition of Professor Ker. On the 
other hand. Professor Gregory Smith's ''Elizabethan 
Critical Essajs " prepares the way for the present work. 
Twenty-five authors are represented, including Bacon, 
Jonson, Chapman, Milton, Davenant, Hobbes, and 
Cowley. 

A new life of Sydney Dobell is one of the literary 
enterprises soon to be taken in hand by that industrious 
book-compiler and book dealer, Mr. Bertram Dobell. 
He writes to the London "Athenaeum" asking all 
holders of the poet's letters to lend them to him for 
use in the proposed biography. A very full life in two 
large volumes was published in 1878, but Mr. Dobell 
thinks there is need of a shorter and more critical 
account of this charming but too little read poet.

THE ASCENT OF PARNASSUS. 

There are two ways of climbing, respectively 
illustrated by the great Pyramid and by the 
Campanile at Venice. The climber may toil 
painfully from one huge step to another pushed 
and pulled by perspiring guides urged to activity 
by thoughts of backsheesh ; or he may loiter 
along a gentle gradient and attain altitude with- 
out seeming effort. The end is the same in both 
cases when at last the wide prospect gladdens 
the eye ; but the ease or difficidty with which it 
has been achieved may have a notable influence 
upon the degree of its enjoyment. Turning to 
literature for a metaphorical application of our 
example, we are reminded of the contrast 
between the difficulties which once beset the 
upward path of the struggling student and the 
enticements which our humaner modern methods 
provide to make the way alluring. Humanity 
may be overdone, as a famous outburst of Ibsen's 
Brand attests ; but on the whole we may rejoice 
that a great deal of merely obstructive rubbish 
— sjmtactical and rhetorical — has been swept 
out of the learner's path. Surely the old-time 
student, clambering toward latinity up his 
Gradus ad Parnassum^ must have thought 
the stairway ironically named, and must have 
reached his goal (if he persevered) in a some- 
what embittered frame of mind. If thus alone 
were Parnassus to be reached (he may weU have 
reflected) there was much to be said for a life 
of Boeotian sluggishness and comfort. In fact, 
he could hardly have failed to doubt if Parnas- 
sus were what it was cracked up to be. 

A doubt of this sort is pretty likely to intrude 
upon the mind of the aspirant toward the appre- 
ciation of literature, whether in school or out, 
if he follow the instructions of the professional 
educator. For literature is a fine art, and the 
natural man (still more the natural boy) does not 
take to it. He is willing to give it a try, because 
the sharps who ought to know say that there 
is something in it ; but his skepticism is well- 
rooted, and doubt may harden into conviction 
if injudiciously dealt with. Supply him with 
counsels of perfection, instead of giving him the 
practical guidance which he needs, and he will 
chuck the whole business in disgust. TeU him 
that he must read (and enjoy) Bacon's Essays

and " The Rape of the Lock " and " Paradise 
Lost " when he is in the " Arabian Nights " 
and " Treasure Island " stage of development, 
and all his healthy young instincts will revolt. 
He will not only reject the advice with seorn 
and contumely, but he will put the adviser down 
as a hypocrite ; for nothing will convince him 
that a person who pretends to enjoy such books 
really means what he says. This state of mind 
is perfectly honest, and must be treated with 
gingerly care if we expect to transform it into 
a state of mind which shall come to accept the 
world's literary judgments as its own. 

A German publisher named August Scherl, 
who has come to look at the subject of literary 
culture from this point of view, has recently 
prepared a library of fifty volumes, selected and 
arranged for the express purpose of attracting 
readers whose literary sense is comparatively 
crude, and of leading them onward and upward 
by easy steps. We have been much interested 
in the examination of Herr Scherl's list, which 
begins with a story of mystery by Xavier de 
Mont^pin and ends with Freytag's " Soil und 
Haben." Possibly the forty-eight intervening 
books would be inadequate to bridge the cul- 
tural chasm delimited by these two landmarks ; 
but the principle involved is pedagogically sound, 
and by some such method as this the faculty 
for enjoying good literature is most likely to be 
developed. In the first half of the list we find 
such books as " Monte Cristo," Jokai's " Black 
Diamonds," tales of adventure by Gerstacker, 
and novels by writers as diverse as M. Georges 
Ohnet, Mrs. Braddon, Mr. Julian Hawthorne, 
Mrs. F. H. Burnett, Dr. Conan Doyle, and 
Bulwer. These are the names that come near- 
est to having relations with literature ; the 
others stand upon a distinctly lower level. 
When we get into the second haK of the list, 
we are conscious of being in distinctly better 
society. Sensational titles become less frequent, 
and names that mean something occur in num- 
bers. Thus we soon come upon Hugo's "Notre 
Dame de Paris," CoUins's " The Moonstone," 
and novels by Messrs. Ernst von Wolzogen and 
Georg von Ompteda. Finally, we reach such 
books as " Ivanhoe," " Froment Jeune et Risler 
Aine," and " Bleak House," and such authors 
as Hauff , Hoffman, Herr Detlev von Liliencron, 
Frau Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach, Herr Fon- 
tane, and Herr Spielhagen. 

It wiU be seen that this list of books is made 
up entirely of fiction, and that it is cosmopolitan 
in its composition. The sesthete and the pedant 
will sniff at four-fifths of the books included. 



and sermonize about the deplorable influence of 
such rubbish upon the growing mind. But to 
our thinking, the very fact that the sort of mind 
aimed at is growing, with maturity nowhere in 
sight, affords ample justification for the inclu- 
sion of the least significant and the most sensa- 
tional of the books above mentioned. A similar 
list prepared for a public of English readers 
should be based upon the same leading prin- 
ciples, although most of the titles would be dif- 
ferent. Such a list would doubtless include, and 
should include, titles by Messrs. Hall Caine and 
S. R. Crockett and Marion Crawford, as well 
as titles by Scott and Dickens and George Eliot. 
The method is beautifully simple. First, allay 
the young reader's suspicion that he is being 
practised upon, and gain his confidence by giv- 
ing him what he really wants. Then cautiously 
and persuasively contrive to get into his hands 
something a little better than he has had before. 
Some of our more progressive librarians have 
practised this method for many years. An 
excellent device, that has been found to work 
successfully, is to insert in every copy of a 
trashy book issued a slip giving the names and 
library numbers of a few other books likely to 
interest the reader, but books which are a little 
better in their representation of life and char- 
acter. 

Herr Julius Hart, discussing the Scherl Li- 
brary in " Das Literarische Echo," commends 
the enterprise in terms of unqualified praise. 

" Is it in school that we learn to read ? No ! All 
school methods are so contrived that they make books 
an object of hatred and a cause of misery. We learn 
to read from books of the < Monte Cristo' sort: fairy- 
books and tales of adventure give us our first real joy 
in reading. For the imagination, that faculty for which 
the school has no room, and which pedagogy most 
atrociously maltreats, from its shackles and dungeons 
clamors for freedom. Our truly vital sense and knowl- 
edge of the superiority of a Goethe over a Mont^pin 
is not born within us, not bestowed upon us by nature, 
but is attained by our own individual effort. When, 
acting after the fashion of the schoolmaster, I snatch 
a novel from the hand of the uncultivated reader and 
force him to read a masterpiece instead, I am plucking 
up by the roots his genuine feeling for art, I am 
destroying his natural enjoyment. I am depriving 
him of the very book that provides for him the high- 
est artistic revelation that is possible for him, I am 
robbing him of of the greatest of artistic blessings. He 
becomes a parrot, and learns only as a bare fact that 
Goethe is the greatest of poets. Also our theoretical 
instruction in criticism is of secondary value only. And 
it is sheer stupidity to take a reader, plunged by some 
popular fiction into an ecstasy of delight, and prove to 
him from Lessing and Aristotle that his satisfaction 
springs from the wrong sources." 

Perhaps this language is a trifle over-emphatic.

but to destroy the walls of pedagogical pre- 
scription a trumpet blast rather than the piping 
of a penny whistle is needed. 

We should very much like to see the Scherl 
experiment tried in English. To outward seem- 
ing the product would be merely another library 
of reprints. But if the selection were skilfully 
made, by someone having a genuine psychologi- 
cal insight into the workings of the immature 
mind, the series would be unlike any that now 
exists. It would move steadily, although prob- 
ably in a spiral path, from comparatively crude 
examples of fiction to works of refined art. 
Each book in the series would be carefully 
chosen with special reference to the one that 
came before and the one that was to follow. 
And many a reader, working not painfully but 
delightedly through the series, would at the 
end of his upward progress find himself, not 
perhaps upon the very summit of Parnassus, but 
at least well above the level of its lower slopes. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The ingenious Mr. De Morgan can invent other 
things besides plots for novels. In an illustrated book- 
let, " William De Morgan," issued for free distribution 
by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co., we read that this versa- 
tile son of the noted mathematician and logician, 
Augustus De Morgan (author of the well-known "Budget 
of Paradoxes") not only manufactures tiles of so peculiar 
a lustre and finish that they are in demand for the best 
English houses, but he also claims to have devised the 
best duplex bicycle (whatever that may be) and the 
most effective sieve in existence, as well as a smoke- 
consuming fire-grate. Two snap-shot photographs of 
Mr. De Morgan taking his ease in sunny Florence 
reveal him as a very likable, thoroughly sincere sort of 
man, and a reproduction of a portrait of him painted by 
his artist wife gives another rather different but not 
unfavorable impression. When he is not in Florence 
he lives at Chelsea, in a rambling house called " The 
Vale," to which Mrs. De Morgan's studio is attached. 
In a recent magazine article the novelist thus described 
his way of working: " I make no scenario, I just go on 
finding, as one often does, such inspiration as is neces- 
sary from my pen. I find that the mere holding of a 
pen makes me think. The pen even seems to have 
some consciousness of its own. It can certainly begin 
the work. Then I forget all about it and go on where- 
soever thought or the characters lead me. I think I 
work best in Florence, where il is always quiet and 
where there is something stimulating in the air. I 
work there all the winter through." 

Shakespeare as a " reformed " speller, though he 
lived three hundred years too early to be conscious of 
his reformation, is instructively referred to by Professor 
Lounsbury in a paper read at the second annual meeting 
of the Simplified Spelling Board and printed for dis- 
tribution by the Board. Whether we are language- 
menders or not, radicals or conservatives in our spelling. 



it is of interest to know that in matters of orthography 
extremes may meet and the most radical measures may 
prove to be the most conservative in a certain sense. 
Many of the simplified spellings are quite largely 
recognized to be returns to ancient forms. In the 
Shakespeare folio of 1623, for example, as Professor 
Lounsbury points out, the ending -er (where we now 
more commonly write -re) is far from unusual. Meter 
appears twice in that volume ; metre not at all. Scepter 
is found thirty-six times; sceptre not once. Center is 
never spelled with -re. Sepulcher occurs eleven times, 
sepulchre twice. Theater is preferred to theatre five 
times out of six. Honor is met with in both spellings, 
but twice as often with -or as with -our. The man for 
whom Shakespeare's spelling was " good enough " was 
imfortunate in his choice of a model, however praise- 
worthy for his spirit of conservatism. One minor point 
presents itself for comment in Mr. Lounsbury's carefully- 
prepared paper. In the very act of urging that any 
changes made should be consistent — or, as he says, in 
regard to vowel-sounds, " a decision ought to be reacht 
as to the precise form by which these sounds are to be 
indicated universally" — he uses (or the reformed 
printer does it for him) in two successive sentences the 
iovmsfonetic and orthography. We also find alfabet, not 
alphabet, in his paper. If the Greek letter phi must 
abdicate in one or in several instances, why not in all ?

The size of ex-presidents' royalties, when ex- 
presidents of this country have been the recipients of 
royalties on literary productions, has been large. The 
current queries as to how much Mr. Roosevelt will 
probably receive from the Messrs. Scribner for his 
African hunting-book might perhaps receive some sort 
of approximate answer from the instance of General 
Grant's " Personal Memoirs." A sum varying from 
four hundred thousand to half a million dollars is com- 
monly given as Mrs. Grant's receipts from this book. 
Before it was published, the author had received what 
were then considered very large payments for the serial 
issue of certain portions in "The Century Magazine"; 
and the annual returns on the work even now must be 
considerable. The first check sent to Mrs. Grant by 
the publishers is said (who knows on what authority ?) 
to have been for two hundred thousand dollars, and the 
next for three-quarters of that sum, — figures that 
might fill with envy even the writers of latter-day " best 
sellers." Mr. Cleveland, it is reported, received hand- 
some remuneration for what he wrote ; and no president 
before Mr. Roosevelt has written so much and on so 
great a variety of subjects. The editing and publishing 
of the late ex-president's unpublished writings will be 
a literary event of interest in the near future — all but 
eclipsed, of course, by the hunting adventures of a living 
ex-president. , . , 

The revival of an old idea of Franklin's is seen 
in the biU recently before Parliament for inducing the 
British public to make more use of daylight and less 
use of lamplight during the summer months. In the 
spring of 1679 Franklin, then in Paris, wrote a playful 
article (entitled in his collected works " An Economical 
Project") professing his surprise, on being accidentally 
awakened one morning at six, at beholding the sun rising 
and flooding his room with light. The astonishing dis- 
covery that Paris was illuminated by the sun long before 
people of fashion thought of rising, he hastened to com- 
municate to the public, and then added his calculations 
on the amount of wax and tallow burned every summer

for lighting purposes by the citizens of the French capital. 
Between the 20th of March and the 20th of September, 
according to his estimate, there were sixty-four million 
pounds of these illuminants needlessly consumed, at a 
cost of ninety-six million francs. He proposed a plan 
of ringing morning bells, firing cannon, and so forth, to 
compel all sleepers to open their eyes to the light of day 
and recognize the propriety of using it. The present 
English project is less obstreperous: it advocates the 
quiet putting forward of clocks twenty minutes each 
Sunday in April, with a reverse proceeding each Sunday 
in September, thus gradually making the summer work- 
ing day begin one hour and twenty minutes earlier than 
at present, and applying a practical test to the truth of 
an old adage hateful to sluggards. In no account of or 
reference to this curious patriarchal (not to say mediae- 
val) bit of proposed legislation have we seen any acknowl- 
edgment to Franklin as the original inventor of the 
scheme. But he was never so popular in London as in 
Paris, and perhaps the oversight is not wholly accidental. 

The library of the "Laughing Hall," as de- 
scribed by Mr. J. N. Farquhar in that excellent Indian 
monthly, " The Hindustan Review " (edited by Sach- 
chidananda Sinha and published at Allahabad) is a 
separate building connected with most of the larger 
Buddhist temples in Japan — perhaps elsewhere too, 
though this is not made clear — and is usually prettily 
carved and brightly painted, and seldom open to visitors. 
But admission is not difficult to obtain, and when the 
doors are flung apart the first object to meet the view 
is the wooden statue of Fu Daishi, or "the Great 
Buddhist Teacher," with his two sons beside him, one 
at the right, the other at the left, and both laughing 
heartily; hence the name of the hall. But the chief 
feature of the library of the Laughing Hall (" Warai-do") 
is a mammoth octagonal revolving bookcase which 
nearly fills the building, but is so nicely mounted on 
its pivot as to turn under a gentle pressure of the hand. 
The case is supposed to contain a printed copy of the 
Chinese Buddhist canon, but this is seldom found to be 
complete. Fu Daishi, a wise Chinese teacher, realizing 
that the canon was too big to be studied and understood 
in its entirety, invented the revolving bookcase — a sort 
of sacred carrousel one might call it — and caused it to 
be proclaimed that whoever made the novel construction 
spin round thrice on its axis would thereby acquire the 
same merit as if he had mastered the whole body of 
religious literature it held. The two boys, one may 
imagine, are laughing in filial glee at their father's 
cleverness. But, after all, this is only another form of 
the familiar praying-wheel, so that we see not why the 
lads should split their sides over it.

Ways of denoting emphasis in print are more 
numerous and varied than one might at first suppose. 
Punctuation is one recognized method: separating a 
word or phrase by commas from the rest of the sen- 
tence often gives it a mild but immistakable emphasis 
of its own. The little arcs of circles that are used for 
parentheses may also call special attention to what they 
profess to make merely subordinate to the context. The 
exclamation point, too, either alone or in connection with 
the marks of parenthesis, is an effective emphasizer. 
Dashes, in pairs or singly, are often impressive to the 
eye. Italics, of course, afford the readiest and common- 
est means of arresting attention ; but many printing offices 
dislike these warped and unsightly characters, and the 
compositor's unwillingness to be troubled with an addi- 



tional and little-used font of type is only natural. Readers 
of German must have noted with approval the common 
mode of marking emphasis in that language, — the spac- 
ing of the letters of the emphasized word. To reader 
and compositor alike this device commends itself and 
might well be adopted universally. Mr. George Bernard 
Shaw, let it be counted to his credit, is doing his best 
to naturalize this typographical Teutonism in his own 
country. The innovation has much in its favor. The 
spaced letters represent to the eye what the slower, more 
impressive pronunciation of the stressed word is to the 
ear. Of course the manuscript indication of emphasis 
by underlining would remain unchanged, but for type- 
writers spacing would be a welcome substitute for the 
present usage. ... 

The puzzling pronunciation of proper names is 
a constant source of fret and vexation ; and this waste of 
nervous energy is a thing to be avoided when the mer- 
cury stands at ninety and over in the shade. The pun- 
gent pen of the public librarian at Los Angeles has been 
making merry, in a semi-satirical manner, over the 
twelve native mispronunciations of the name of his city. 
Especially does he deprecate the " jabber ^ " almost uni- 
versally heard in the utterance of the name, whereas 
the true sound is not unlike that of German ch, or, if one 
cannot achieve the aspirated guttural, our own hard g 
will serve fairly well in rapid pronunciation. " Quite as 
bad," continues Mr. Lummis, " are those who give the 
two e's the ' day ' soimd (which e in Spanish has only 
when accented) and call the last word ' ANN-Hay-Lace.' 
This is indeed a commonplace of the two-bit * Spanish- 
in-twenty-four-lessons ' vocabularies ; but is as offensive 
to the critic as the jabber g. Despite notable geographic 
differences, the e-soimds are identical m ' heaven ' ' hell ' 
and ' Los Angeles.' " To sum up the whole case in 
convenient mnemonic form, Mr. Lunamis appends " the 
following local jingle " : 

"The lady would remind you, please, 
Her name is not 

Lost Angle Lees, 
Nor Angie anything whatever. 
She hopes her friends will be so clever 
To share her fit historic pride 
The O shall not be jellified. 
O longr, G hard, and rhyme with ' yes,' 
And all about 

Loce Ang-el-ess." 

A COPPEE ANECDOTE, at ouce enjoyable and pointing 
a wholesome moral, has been wafted across the Atlantic. 
The deceased novelist and poet was in early life intro- 
duced to Catulle Mend^s, who received him cordially 
and welcomed him to his salon in the Rue de Douai, 
where a little circle of poets recited their poems to one 
another. One day Mendfes received an unsigned copy of 
verses written in a beautiful hand; and the same even- 
ing he read them — they bore the title " Les Fleurs 
Mortelles " — to his assembled company. They evoked 
praise to the point of enthusiasm ; and when their author 
(Copp^e, of course) acknowledged them as his, and con- 
fessed to " six thousand others," his kind host bade him 
bring them also, bring them all ! The young man com- 
plied, and, after Mendfes had finished reading them, 
asked his opinion of their merit. " To be frank with 
you," was the critic's blunt rejoinder, "they are all 
execrable. You are admirably gifted, but you don't 
know the first word of your trade." " Teach it to me, 
then," returned Copp^e, and without flinching he threw 
his precious verses, the whole six thousand, into the fire 
and resolutely set about learning how to do better.

The weary wanderings of " Mademoiselle Ixk," 
before she (or it) found hospitable reception at the hands 
of Mr. Fisher Unwin, the London publisher, contain 
matter for the encouragement of unrecognized genius. 
For five years the graceful little tale, which only wanted 
publication to leap into immediate popular favor, went 
the round of the publishers before its final sponsor ended 
its travels. Its author, Miss Mary Elizabeth Hawker, 
better known by her psuedonym " Lanoe Falconer," has 
recently died, leaving to her credit at least two other 
successful novels, " The Hotel d'Angleterre " and 
" Cecilia de Noel," besides a collection of pleasant 
sketches entitled " Old Hampshire Vignettes." Another 
woman novelist whose first work likewise had many 
unappreciative professional readings before it was given 
to the kinder public, and who quickly thereafter attained 
fame (with her own widening circle of readers) and for- 
tune (wherewith she built herself a castle in Wales), has 
also lately died. " Allen Raine " — which, prosaically 
rendered, means Mrs. Beynon Puddicombe — issued her 
first book, " A Welsh Singer," in 1897, and since then 
her publishers have sold almost two million copies of 
her popular stories. The six publishers who are said 
to have rejected " A Welsh Singer " before it found 
favor with Messrs. Hutchinson must have shed many 
subsequent tears of mortification and repentance.

Song-strains from a new Republic are wafted to 
us from Cuba in two recent publications. Amor de 
Ensueno y de Romanticismo, by Federico Uhrbach, and 
La Vision del Aguila, by Josd Manuel Carbonell. There 
seems to be, indeed, a remarkable intellectual ferment 
throughout all Latin America. In Cuba alone, such 
names as Ricardo del Monte, Conde Kostia, Enrique 
Jos^ Varona, Alfredo Martin Morales, and Arturo R. 
de Carricarte, though little known to us, count for a 
good deal. All these writers, all the Spanish- American 
writers, look to France for leadership and models, and 
it would probably be impossible to shake this allegiance 
and get them to accept our ideals and art. But now 
that the United States is making an effort to know and 
be known to the other peoples of our Western World, 
it would not only be a courteous but a politic thing to 
give some attention to. their literature. There is noth- 
ing that any country appreciates more than consideration 
paid to its intellectual performances. Why does not 
one of our enterprising magazines secure from a com- 
petent authority an article or set of articles giving some 
account of Cuban and Mexican and South American 
writers ? ... 

The humors of genealogy-hunters, as they dis- 
play themselves to weary and long-suffering library 
attendants, reveal very clearly the fact that however 
varied and unaccountable may be the humors of these 
delvers into forgotten lore, their sense of humor, in the 
singular number, is conspicuously absent. From the 
Peabody Library in Baltimore - comes the story of a 
pedigree-chaser who, with the customary vagueness of 
conception as to what line of inquiry to pursue and 
what books to ask for, placidly shifted the burden of 
the whole affair on to the shoulders of the uncomplaining 
attendant. In due time a smaU mountain of books 
likely to prove helpful was brought to the visitor, who, 
after surveying them in surprise, pleaded weakness of 
eyesight and asked the panting servitor to do the neces- 
sary reading and dig for the desired information. But 
this was more than that accommodating person could 
undertake, regular duties forbidding. "Well," said 



the other, with a last look at the laboriously gathered 
volumes, " I '11 read thpm some other time. Good day, 
and thank you ever so much ! " It may be interesting 
to note that the visitor was a woman. 

A Quebec pageant in a library is what the fine 
display of Americana at the John Carter Brown Library 
might be called. While the conquest of Canada has 
just been presented in mimic form to the citizens of 
Quebec and their visiting friends, the people of Provi- 
dence and vicinity have had exposed to their view a rich 
collection of priceless manuscripts, maps, and early 
printed works, relating to the early history of our 
northern neighbor. Most important of all is the auto- 
graph manuscript of Champlain's account of his first 
voyage to this continent and of his explorations as far 
southward as the West Indies and the City of Mexico. 
This manuscript, after remaining in the hands of 
Champlain's descendants for three hundred years, was 
purchased by John Nicholas Brown in 1884, and event- 
ually became a part of the memorial library named after 
his father, John Carter Brown, and now administered 
by the trustees of Brown University. This library, 
because of its imrivalled collection of early Americana, 
is able to make a unique display of illustrative matter 
beaxing on the great events celebrated at Quebec.

Our far-western neighbor, Japan, is regarded 
by Professor George Trumbull Ladd as rather occidental 
than oriental in type. In a late issue of the " Inter- 
national Conciliation " bi-monthly pamphlets, Dr. Ladd 
treats of the relations of America and Japan, and of the 
desirability of a firm friendship between the two. He 
takes occasion to say that " Japan has never been, and 
is not now, Oriental, as are India, China, and Korea. Its 
two hundred and fifty years of exclusiveness and of 
isolated feudal development, as well as certain racial 
characteristics, prevented the more purely Oriental type 
of civilization from gaining supremacy there." And, 
what is more, he believes that " the citizen of the United 
States or of Western Europe, who is prepared to get 
below certain superficial differences and reach down to 
the more fundamental likeness, may feel more at home 
m Japan than in certain parts of Europe itself; and 
much more than in Turkey in Asia or, indeed, any por- 
tion of the Near East." Thus do extremes meet, and 
what we had thought to be the Farthest East proves to 
be instead the Farthest West.

A " Bibliography of Municipal Betterment " 
has been issued by the Kansas City Public Library, the 
classified titles filling the greater part of the April num- 
ber of " The Public Library Quarterly." The bibliog- 
raphy appears to embrace only material in the library 
itself, but is of very respectable proportions neverthe- 
less. First comes a list of books, under various sub- 
classes such as, — Baths, Charities, Child Labor, Cities,. 
Citizenship, Elections, Food and Food Adulteration, 
Housing Problem; and so on through the alphabet. 
Then follows a 47-page list of periodical articles, 
imder appropriate headings. A short preface on " The 
Betterment Movement " precedes the bibliography and 
calls attention to the importance of concerted action on 
the part of all citizens interested in mimicipal improve- 
ment. "The ideal city of our century," the preface 
concludes, " must have civic beauty as well as civic 
safety, and the responsibility rests on every individual, 
as a part of a unit, to accomplish this end."

cies of the press, it will maintain its claim on our 
serious consideration. Some late controversies 
and other events, widely chronicled and dis- 
cussed, have brought " The Times " into unusual 
public notice, so that the appearance just now 
of a life of its greatest editor, John Thadeus 
Delane, is peculiarly seasonable ; for an account 
of Delane during his thirty-six years' editorial 
conduct of " The Times " is an account of the 
paper itself during that period. It was in those 
years, from 1841 to 1877, that this newspaper, 
already a prominent and authoritative journal 
under Thomas Barnes's editorship, attained a 
position of unexampled influence and dignity, 
and made even princes and potentates tremble 
when it chose to frown. 

How closely John Delane identified himself 
with " The Times '' is indicated by the fact that 
he became its editor at twenty-three years of age 
and continued in the editorial chair until two 
years before his death at sixty-two, taking few 
and short vacations, cherishing no absorbing out- 
side interests, and never even allowing himself 
the sweet distraction of a wife. Though he 
wrote comparatively little himself, there passed 
under his editorial eye and corrective pen prob- 
ably no fewer than forty thousand articles which 
were printed as editorial utterances and for which 
he was virtually and legally responsible. Much 
that appeared under the head of leading articles, 
says his biographer, " was so amended by his pen 
that it was in reality Delane s handiwork, and 
his ablest writers, instead of feeling impatient 
at his alterations and corrections, were free to 
confess that he had much improved their com- 
position." 

So early in his young manhood did this great 
editor take up the work to which he was to 
•devote the rest of his life that little of interest 
remains to be said of his history apart from his 
journalistic labors and those activities in society 
and in occasional travel that he made contrib- 
utory to his influence and equipment as head of 
" The Times." He was born in London, Oct. 11, 
1817, of Protestant Irish ancestry, the family

being settled in England as early as the seven- 
teenth century. Why John Thadeus, or his 
parents, chose to misspell his middle name, is not 
explained. Graduated from Magdalen College, 
Oxford, in 1840, he immediately joined the staff 
of " The Times," of which his father was busi- 
ness manager and John Walter chief proprietor. 
Young Delane had already dipped his maiden 
pen in journalistic ink, though what and how 
much he had written cannot now be determined ; 
but his ability received prompt recognition of 
so cordial a nature that when Barnes died in the 
following year the new recruit was called upon 
to fiU his chair. A few years later Delane's 
college friend and subsequent brother-in-law, 
George Webbe Dasent, now known to the world 
chiefly for his studies in Norse mythology, was 
summoned to assist him in the editorship, and 
for a quarter of a century the two labored in a 
common cause with mutual profit and satisfac- 
tion. This professional and personal intimacy 
left Dasent,^ on his friend's death, peculiarly 
fitted to become his biographer ; and a biog- 
raphy was contemplated, though contemplation 
had not passed into action when the surviving 
friend was himself overtaken by death, leaving 
to his son, Mr. Arthur Irwin Dasent (who, by 
the way, also took a wife from the Delane family), 
the task not merely of completing, but of begin- 
ning as well as ending, the tardy history of 
Delane's brilliant achievements in journalism. 
Letters in abundance, to and from Delane, and 
especially from him to his friend Dasent, were 
at hand for aid in this work, and they have been 
copiously drawn upon in the book. 

To give, in the author's own words, a con- 
ception of the power exerted by " The Times " 
under Delane's editorship, we will quote a few 
sentences. 

" As compared with the present state of the Press, 
now so largely dominated by sensation and advertise- 
ment, the influence of The Times under Delane can 
hardly be conceived ; and we may say without exagger- 
ation or partiality that, as conducted by him for a period 
of thirty-six years, the hterary reputation of the paper 
reached its zenith. Instead of blindly following public 
opinion, he rose to such a position of supremacy in his 
profession that he was able to create it; and on more 
than one memorable occasion, if the Government of the 
day in formulating its policy minted the coin, it was The 
Times which uttered it and saw that it rang true." 

A three-page list of the journal's principal 
contributors and staff-members under Delane 
is appended, and the names of parliamentary 
leaders and other statesmen and celebrities who 
corresponded and considted with the great editor 
and potent moulder of public opinion would

make a much longer catalogue. Of some of these 
noted men who were from time to time enlisted 
in Delane's service the author says : 

"Robert Lowe, like another of Delane's trusted 
writefs who still lives — a journalist before he became 
a politician, — the epigrammatic and cynical Abraham 
Hay ward, Thomas Mozley (Newman's brother-in-law), 
the brilliant if erratic Laurence Oliphant, Greorge Stoviu 
Venables, Kinglake, Cheuery, Henry Wace, now dean 
of Canterbury, William Stebbing, the editor's right- 
hand man in his later years in Printing House Square, 
and last, but by no means least. Sir William Howard 
Russell, the first of war correspondents — all these and 
many more were brought into the service of the paper 
by Delane." 

There is still another famous character that 
must not be passed over in this connection. He 
has a paragraph to himself in the account of 
those who helped to build up " The Times." 

" But to the catalogue of clever brains who, at the 
bidding of a master mind, devoted the best years of 
their lives to building up the prosperity and power of 
The Times must be added the name of yet another, 
prominent alike in the world of politics and letters, 
with whom, from the very earliest days of his editor- 
ship, Delane was in close touch. This was Charles 
Greville, that thorough man of the world, who, under 
a cynical exterior, successfully concealed a nature which 
contained the elements of kindliness and generosity. 
What Pepys was to the seventeenth and Horace 
Walpole to the eighteenth century, the sardonic ' Grun- 
cher ' was to the nineteenth, and his Memoirs, the very 
salt of political and social autobiography, must ever 
remain a mine of information to those who desire to 
study at first hand the inner history of governments in 
England from the reign of George IV. to the mid- 
Victorian era." 

Delane's occasional foreign travels took him 
as far east as the Crimea, in 1854, and as far 
west as Niagara Falls, in 1856 ; and from his 
American letters to Dasent the following, writ- 
ten at Albany, comes near to being an epis- 
tolary curiosity. 

" I really ought not to write you anything, for I am 
very tired, and unless I were to write a volume I could 
give you no real idea of the impression this country 
makes on me. It seems a mass of contradictions. Every- 
thing is so famUiar in one respect, and yet so unlike what 
one has ever seen before. People are extremely brusque 
and yet extravagantly civil. The servants are most 
obliging friends, strangers accost you after the old [a 
word illegible] form, and, having broken the ice, them- 
selves ' guess ' you would Uke to know their friends, who 
are accordingly introduced, shake hands and talk Elec- 
tion. Then, leaving Boston this morning, we have passed 
through fifty miles at least of primaeval forest with very 
few ' clearings,' and even in these the stumps sticking up 
in every square yard, while whole groves of ' girdled ' 
trees in the distance look like as many skeletons. On 
Saturday a banker ' concluded * I was from Europe and 
talked an hour about what I had best see while a crowd 
of customers were waiting. The hotels are capital; 
beyond all praise for their cleanliness, order, good 
attendance and hberality. . . . The English are very 



popular and I have heard it said a dozen times that 
America felt humbled when we declined to take offence 
at the dismissal of Crampton. At church yesterday the 
preacher — Theodore Parker, a great gun here — spoke 
of England as ' that country which we all love so dearly,' 
and on Friday all Boston went mad at a dinner given to 
Peabody as a reward for his supposed exertions to keep 
the peace." 

After all that, it is with regret that we recall 
the attitude taken by " The Times " toward this 
hospitable and liberal Northern section of our 
country when it found itself plunged in civil 
strife and acutely sensitive to the friendly or 
hostile air worn by on-looking nations across 
the water. With Palmerston in the government 
and Delane in his great newspaper expressing 
sympathy for the South, how different might 
have been the course of nineteenth-century his- 
tory but for a combination of lucky accidents — 
one of them being the break-down of the Atlantic 
cable, which at a critical juncture caused delay 
in trans-oceanic communication and made for 
calmer counsels and cooler second thoughts. 

In summing up Delane's qualities in the con- 
cluding chapter of the book, the author has this 
to say among other things — he refers especially 
to the famous editor's sturdy independence : 

" Taking this view of his position, he was at no time 
what could be called a party man, yet his instincts were 
essentially Liberal, as the columns of the paper suf- 
ficiently show. Hewn out of the very ore of liberty 
and progress, they will ever remain the best monument 
to his memory. It was his pride to administer the 
editorship justly, fearlessly, and generously, and while 
some may say that he was proud, harsh, and even a 
remorseless taskmaster, our testimony must be that he 
was a true, sincere, and kind-hearted man, animated by 
a lofty sense of duty, incapable of an unjust or dishonor- 
able act." 

This excellent biography of Delane the editor, 
but somewhat meagre description of Delane the 
man and member of society, is written in a style 
that comes so near to being good as almost to 
tantalize the reader. A very little more care 
would have polished many a roughness, smoothed 
out many a wrinkle. We must bestow a word 
of praise upon the excellent index and occasional 
footnotes, and the two clear portraits of Delane. 
There are but four other illustrations, which may 
be counted a relief in these days of cheap and 
abundant process prints.

The Unrest of the Orient.* 



That the political and economic equilibrium 
of the Orient has rarely been less stable than it 
is to-day, is the all but universal testimony of 
observers of Far Eastern affairs. We are 
assured on every hand that the restless ambition 
and aggressiveness of Japan presages expansion, 
exploitation, bitter rivalries, and stubborn con- 
flict ; that Russia is but temporarily checked, 
not in any real sense defeated, in her great 
purpose of dominance toward the Pacific ; that 
China is certain to remain a disturbing factor of 
prime importance, whether as an awakened and 
regenerated power or as the tool and victim of 
predatory nations ; that, in brief, the future 
historian of the Orient will look back upon the 
late Russo-Japanese war as merely an episode — 
at the most, a sort of prologue — in the peren- 
nial combat of Far Eastern forces. 

The most recent presentation of this line of 
argument by one who may fairly be termed an 
expert is to be found in Mr. B. L. Putnam 
Weale's " The Coming Struggle in Eastern 
Asia." This volume is announced as the con- 
elusion of a series whose publication was begun 
five years ago. In " Manchu and Muscovite " 
(1903) the point of view was distinctly unfavor- 
able to Russia, and the author did not hesitate 
to shower praise upon the Japanese as the ablest 
rivals of the Muscovite and as the sole vigorous 
champions of the higher civilization in the 
Orient. At the close of the war (during which 
Mr. Weale was a careful personal observer of 
Far Eastern affairs) appeared a more ambitious 
work under the title " The Re-shaping of the 
Far East." In this book the status of China, 
Japan, Korea, and Manchuria, and of the Occi- 
dental powers represented in the Orient, was 
described at great length ; but the author felt 
obliged to recall much of his earlier laudation 
of Japan and to substitute for it an attitude of 
moderate censure, particularly when Korean 
affairs were under consideration. In 1907 the 
third book in the series was published, " The 
Truce in the East and its Aftermath." In it the 
author advanced to a more pronounced arraign- 
ment of Japan, maintaining that Japanese 
aims and ideals had developed in a direction 
absolutely different from that which had been 
expected, and that they had become plainly sub- 
versive of the best interests of the Orient and 
of the world at large. 

The volume now under review, " The Coming

Struggle in Eastern Asia," is hardly the ablest 
and most convincing of the series, but it con- 
tains much that is worth while, and in relation 
to Mr. Weale's personal views it marks a full 
and unreserved conversion from the pro- 
Japanese of five years ago to the strongly anti- 
Japanese of to-day. The book is presented by 
its author as " a careful revaluation of the old 
forces in the Far Eastern situation, as they dis- 
played themselves during the first half of this 
year (1907)." It falls into three parts, the 
first dealing with " Russia Beyond Lake Bai- 
kal," the second with " The New Problem of 
Eastern Asia," and the third with " The 
Struggle Round China." 

The first part comprises a very detailed 
description of conditions in easternmost Russia 
as the author found them during an observation 
trip in the autumn of 1906. The starting-point 
is Vladivostock, which, it is pointed out, has 
become once more " the outlook post, the ad- 
vanced entrenched position of great White 
Russia." After an interesting exposition of 
the commercial and military strength of this 
point, the author goes on to tell of the Ussuri 
railway, Khabarovsk and the Amur province, 
and the present status of Manchuria. The 
fundamental fact, in Mr. Weale's judgment, in 
the whole problem of the future of Eastern Asia 
is the steady, irrisistible, inevitable advance of 
Russia — of European Russia — toward the 
Pacific. " The Siberia of the story-books," 
he declares, " has already disappeared never to 
return. Siberia must now be looked upon as 
the exact Russian equivalent of the American 
Far West or the new Canadian Northwest. 
Railways, a great movement of virile men and 
women, agricultural machinery, houses of brick, 
wood, and stone, and all the inventions of a mar- 
vellously inventive age, — in a very short inter- 
val these can make an unconquered country, 
which is inhabited by inferior races and is 
gifted with a wholesome soil and climate, a new 
piece of Europe, as European as the countries 
of the old world, as white as the whitest." It 
is Mr. Weale's conviction that they not only can 
do this, but that they are already rapidly doing 
it in Asiatic Russia. 

The second part of the book is taken up with 
a consideration of the present state of Japan, 
with reference to government, industry, com- 
merce, finance, military and naval strength, 
colonies, emigration, and international relations. 
Despite the strong anti-Japanese slant already 
mentioned, the treatment is candid and illumin- 
ating. Not the least valuable chapter for the

general reader is one describing very clearly the 
actual workings of the Japanese imperial gov- 
ernment, accompanied by the complete text of 
the much misunderstood Japanese constitution 
of 1889. This is followed, in the third part, 
by a similar interpretation of present-day China. 
Although one may not glean from it a great 
deal that is reaUy new, one cannot put his hands 
upon a more sane, compact, and readable dis- 
cussion of the subject in English.

The Larger Problems of Heredity.* 



We learn from the Preface to this book that 
it " is intended as an introduction to the study of 
heredity, which everyone admits to be a subject 
of fascinating interest and of great practical 
importance. . . . Simple the exposition cannot 
be, if one has any ambition for thoroughness ; 
but it is probably simple enough for those who 
have got beyond the pottering, platitudinarian 
stage, which deals in heredity with a capital H." 
This quotation may be supplemented by the 
remark that the book has the usual qualities of 
Professor Thomson's writings ; that is to say, it 
is intelligible, pleasant to read, and distinguished 
by a broad outlook. If it does not contribute 
any important original facts, it is at least suf- 
ficiently original in the matter of treatment, while 
at the same time impartial enough to furnish an 
adequate exposition of all the more noteworthy 
points of view. At the present time, when there is 
a growing sense of the immense practical impor- 
tance of the subject, following close on the heels 
of numerous remarkable discoveries, the value 
of a work which is at once up to date and capable 
of being understood by any ordinarily intelligent 
person can scarcely be exaggerated. It is not 
too much to say, that no one is fitted to deal with 
the problems which are now looming large on the 
horizon of human affairs, who has not paid atten- 
tion to such matters as are discussed in Professor 
Thomson's book. We are not exactly prepared 
to insist that the perusal of the work shoidd be 
a sine qua non for all who propose to exercise 
the rights of suffrage or of parenthood ; but it 
can scarcely be doubted that if it were possible 
to enforce such a ruling, great benefits would 
result. 

Professor Thomson is not one of those who 
would reduce sociology to a mere branch of 
zoology. Himself a keen sociologist, he recog-

Putnam's Sons. 



nizes fully that human society contains many 
elements which cannot be interpreted — at any 
rate at present — by purely biological reasoning. 
To treat human consciousness and its conse- 
quences in a purely biological way is as mis- 
leading as the reduction of biological phenomena 
to mere chemistry and mechanics. Whatever 
one may believe as to ultimate possibilities, 
whatever monism may be one's philosophical 
creed, humanity spells words which, whether or 
not composed of mere letters of the biological 
alphabet, mean something very different from 
those letters themselves, singly or collectively. 
All of this is fully and frankly recognized ; and 
because of this, the reader will accept with a 
better heart the weighty advice of biology to 
sociology — advice no more to be brushed aside 
than that of the physical sciences to biology 
itseK. 

" By the education of conscience on a scientific basis 
there is already arising a wholesome prejudice against 
the marriage and especially the intermarriage of sub- 
jects in whom there is a strong hereditary bias to certain 
diseases — such as epilepsy and diabetes, to take two 
very different instances. Is it Utopian to hope that this 
will extend with increasing knowledge, and that the 
ethical consciousness of the average man will come more 
and more to include in its varied content ' a feeling of 
responsibility for the healthf ulness of succeeding genera- 
tions ? ' . . . 

" The argument always used against deliberate pre- 
ferential mating on a eugenic basis is that our ignorance 
is immense. And this must be frankly admitted. Yet 
there are some things that we do know. . . . 

" That the best general constitutions should be mated, 
is the first rule of good breeding. That a markedly 
good constitution should not be paired with a markedly 
bad one, is a second rule, — a disregard of which means 
wanton wastage. A third rule is that a person exhibit- 
ing a bias towards a specific disease should not marry 
another with the same bias. ... In other words, every 
possible care should be taken of a relatively sound stock. 
The careless tainting of a good stock is a social crime " 
(pp. 305-306). 

All this will have to contend with a wall of 
ancient prejudice ; nevertheless, — 

" The basis of preferential mating is not unalterable ; 
in fact, we know that it sways hither and thither from 
age to age. Possible marriages are everyday prohibited 
or refrained from for the absurdest of reasons; there is 
no reason why they should not be prohibited or refrained 
from for the best of reasons — the welfare of our race. 
For the average man, instinctive ' falling in love ' will 
probably remain a safer guide than any scientific eugenic 
counsels, but there is no reason to doubt that eugenic 
considerations will in the course of time enter sub- 
consciously into the prolegomena of that mysterious 
process." 

On the other hand, the process of selection 
cannot be left to unaided " nature." 

" It has often been said that modern hygiene, in tend- 
ing to eliminate our eliminators — the microbes — is 



60 



THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



destroying a most valuable selective agency which has 
helped to make our race what it is. This seems a little 
like saying that the destruction of venomous snakes in 
India is eliminating a most valuable selective agency 
which has helped to evolve the Wisdom of the East. 

" It is difficult to find justification for the enthusiastic 
confidence which some seem to have in the value of 
microbes as eliminators. Which microbe ? Surely not 
that of plague, which strikes indifferently, and is no 
more discriminately selective than an earthquake. 
Surely not that of typhus, which used to kill weak and 
strong alike. Surely not that of typhoid, which may 
strike anyone, and does not confer more than a passing 
immunity. And so on through a long list." 

In other words, these microbes merely spare 
those resistant to themselves, a form of selection 
which produces results quite disconnected with 
higher human values, and only of importance 
from any standpoint in the presence of the dis- 
eases. In the competition of race with race, 
where some have undergone this kind of evolu- 
tion while others have not, the outcome has a 
terrible significance — the tax which in the one 
case has been exacted through the centuries, 
being in the other levied all at once, as it were ; 
but for intraracial ends, especially in the light 
of modern science, the microbes may well be 
dispensed with. So says Professor Thomson. 

" At present we can only indicate that the future of 
our race depends on Eugenics (in some form or other), 
combined with the simultaneous evolution of Eutechnics 
and Eutopias. ' Brave words,' of course; but surely not 
'Utopian'!" (p. 308). 

It must not be supposed that the book con- 
sists principally of propagandist argument ; it is 
full of recitals of the most interesting and im- 
portant facts, which we make no attempt to 
summarize. It is for these that it should be 
read, because they supply the materials from 
which everyone may draw his own conclusions. 
In the attempt to be perfectly clear, the author 
has practically repeated himself a good deal in 
different places ; but this no doubt has an ade- 
quate pedagogical justification, assuming that 
the reader is not a specialist. Although the 
work may fairly be described as up to date, the 
progress of the subject is such that in the mere 
processes of printing and publishing any treat- 
ment gets belated. Thus it happens that the 
recent important results of Tower and Mac- 
Dougal throwing light on the causes of variation 
have either not been considered or have reached 
the author so recently that it was impracticable 
to make use of them. That Tower's work was 
not unknown to Professor Thomson is evident 
from the fact that he cites it in the bibliography 
and copies some of the figures from it.

Recent Poetry.* 



When Mr. Swinburne told the tragic story of the 
Lombard queen, some years ago, it seemed as if he 
had carried to its utmost extreme the reaction from 
the exuberant and verbose manner of his earlier 
dramatic period. But " The Duke of Gandia " 
shows that a further extreme was still possible, for 
nothing is more marvellous about this new work 
than its compression, its bareness of ornament, and 
its success in making suggestion a substitute for 
speech. For these reasons it does not lend itself 
readily to quotation. One fine passage of consider- 
able length may, however, be given, with the ex- 
planation that it is spoken by Caesar Borgia, after 
he has done to death his brother Francesco, to the 
grief-stricken Alexander, their father. 

" What they say and what thou sayest I hold 
False. Tho' thou has wept as woman, howled as wolf, 
Above our dead, thou art hale and whole. And now 
Behoves thee rise again as Christ our God, 
Vicarious Christ, and cast as flesh away 
This grief from off thy godhead. I and thou, 
One, will set hard as never God hath set 
To the empire and the steerage of the world. 
Do thou forget but him who is dead, and was 
Nought, and bethink thee what a world to wield 
The eternal God hath given into thine hands 
Which daily mould him out of bread, and give 
His kneaded flesh to feed on. Thou and I 
Will make this rent and ruinous Italy 
One. Ours it shall be, body and soul, and great 
Above all power and glory given of God 
To them that died to set thee where thou art — 
Throned on the dust of Caesar and of Christ, 
Imperial. Earth shall quail again, and rise 
Again the higher because she trembled. Rome 
So bade it be : it was, and shall be." 

What is probably the most striking evidence of the re- 
straint under which the poet has placed himself in the 
composition of this grim tragedy is the fact that only 
a single lyric — and that of four lines only — occurs 
in the entire work. These are the lovely words of the 
song, the last upon the lips of the doomed Francesco. 

" Love and night are life and light ; 
Sleep and wine and song 
Speed and slay the halting day 
Ere it live too long."

"That shalt not thou," says the assassin, and the 
dagger is plunged into Francesco's breast. One old 
trick of Mr. Swinburne's diction has become a man- 
nerism in the present poem. We refer to the 
enjambement which carries a thought over to the 
first syllable of the next line. Four examples of 
this may be found in the passage above quoted, and 
innumerable others elsewhere in the work. Artist- 
ically, the effect of this device is admirable ; it 
heightens our sense of the verbal economy at which 
the poet has so evidently aimed throughout. This 
marvellous work, which no other poet now living 
could dream of equalling, is of small dimensions, 
consisting of but four hundred verses, divided into 
four brief scenes. But it bears all the burden of a 
full-grown tragedy. 

These remarks about Mr. Swinburne's tragedy 
may fittingly be followed by an account of the vol- 
ume in which Mr. Alfred Noyes pays reverent 
homage to his master. It is another case of 

" The youngest to the oldest singer 
That England bore," 

for Mr. Noyes is the latest comer to the ranks of 
those to whom poetry is a high and sacred mission, 
and his tribute was evoked by the occasion of Mr. 
Swinburne's seventieth birthday. We have space 
only for the last two of the four stanzas. 

" For he, the last of that immortal race 

Whose music like a robe of living light 
Re-clothed each new-born age and made it bright 
As with the glory of Love's transfiguring face, 
Reddened earth's roses, kindled the deep blue 
Of England's radiant ever-singing sea, 

Recalled the white Thalassian from the foam, 
Woke the dim stars anew. 
And triumphed in the triumph of Liberty, 

We claim him ; but he hath not here his home. 

" Not here ! Round him to-day the clouds divide. 

We know what faces thro' that rose-flushed air 

Now bend above him — Shelley's face is there, 

And Hugo's lit with more than kingly pride ; 

Replenished there with splendour the blind eyes 

Of Milton bend from heaven to meet his own ; 

Sappho is there crowned with those queenlier flowers 
Whose g^aft outgrew our skies, 
His gift : Shakespeare leans earthward from his throne 
With hands outstretched. He needs no crown of ours." 

We particularly welcome in Mr. Noyes the recur- 
rence of that note of deep and lofty patriotism which 
is the glory, not only of Mr. Swinburne, but also of 
Milton and Shelley, of Wordsworth and Tennyson, 
the note which has been conspicuously missing from 
the blatant mouthings of the latter-day singers of 
imperialism. We find it in "The Empire-Builders," 
which thus begins and thus ends : 

" Who are the Empire-bnilders ? They 

Whose desperate arrogance demands 
A self -reflecting power to sway 

A hundred little selfless lands ? 
Lord God of battles, ere we bow 

To these and to their soulless lust. 
Let fall thy thunders on us now 

And strike us equal to the dust. 



" For hearts that to their home are true 

Where'er the tides of power may flow, 
Have built a kingdom great and new 

Which Time nor Fate shall overthrow ; 
These are the Empire builders, these 

Annex where none shall say them nay, 
Beyond the world's uncharted seas. 

Realms that can never pass away." 

We find the same note in the fervent stanzas " In 
Time of War." 

" And here to us the eternal charge is given 

To rise and make our low world touch God's high: 
To hasten God's own Kingdom, Man's own heaven, 
And teach Love's grander army how to die. 

" No kingdom then, no long-continuing city 

Shall e'er again be stablished by the sword ; 
No blood-bought throne defy the powers of pity. 
No despot's crown outweigh one helot's word. 

" Imperial England, breathe thy marching orders : 
The great host waits; the end, the end is close. 
When earth shall know thy peace in all her borders. 
And all her deserts blossom with thy Rose." 

The classical poems in this volume constitute an 
important gfroup. Even such worn themes as 
Orpheus and Pha6thon and Perseus receive a touch 
of fresh grace in this poet's handling. " The Last of 
the Titans," for example, tells of the Atlas myth, 
and of how the slayer of Medusa turned the giant 
to stone. Here is a fine passage descriptive of the 
Titan's solitude. 

" Beneath him, like a tawny panther-skin. 
The great Sahara slept : beyond it lay, 
Parcelled and plotted out like tiny fields. 
The princedoms and the kingdoms of this eartli, 
Mountains like frozen wrinkles on a sea, 
And seas like rain-pools in a rutted road 
Dwindling beneath his loneliness. Above 
The chariots of ten thousand thousand suns 
Conspired to make him lonelier, and rolled 
Their flaming wheels remote, so that they seemed, 
E'en Alioth and Fomalhaut, no more 
Than dust of diamonds in the abysmal gloom. 
So from a huger loneliness he gazed 
Over the world where, faint as morning mists 
Drifting thro' shadowy battles on the hills. 
Drifting thro' many a pageant touched with red, 
Cities of men and nations passed away." 

Mr. Noyes is singularly happy in his lyrical mea- 
sures, and his song has the spontaneity of a bird's 
carolling. 

" When that I loved a maiden 
My heaven was in her eyes. 
And when they bent above me 

I knew no deeper skies ; 
But when her heart forsook me. 

My spirit broke its bars, 
For grief beyond the sunset 
And love beyond the stars." 

It is a true poet that we have represented by the 
above extracts, a poet of such rare quality as to mark 
him as the peer of the best among the younger 
generation. He is certainly of the rank of Mr, 
Phillips and Mr. Watson, and he surpasses the 
former in freshness of vision, the latter in facility 
of utterance. 

A cultivated and reflective mind, dwelling upon 
themes of art, religion, history, and the legendary

THE DIAL 



[August 1, 



past, finding for its thoughts and fancies a striking 
form of individual expression — this is the substance 
of what is offered us by " L.," in " The Dark Ages 
and Other Poems." If not always poetical, the 
author has a vigorous form of speech that reaches its 
mark, as in this section of his titular poem. 

" Men call you ' dark.* Was Chaucer's speech a muddy 
stream, 
The language born of Norman sun and Saxon snow ? 
Was Langland's verse or Wyclif 's prose mere glow-worm's 
gleam ? 

And the tales 
Of Arthur's sword and of the Holy Grail, 
And Avalon, the isle where no storms blow : 
From such romance did no light glance ? 
Have we not heard a tongue 
Whose word the Saxon thralls 
Would scorn to speak above their muck-rake and their fork, 
The speech of barrack-rooms and music-halls, 
Where every fool has flung 
The rotten refuse of Calcutta and New York ? " 

Here is a writer who knows what he thinks, and is 
not chary about saying it. Other pieces reveal a 
charm that is lacking in the above quotation, and 
of these " The Bells of Venice " may be taken as an 
example. 

" Ring out again that faltering strain. 

Cease not so soon. 
Sweet peal that brought to me the thought 
Of some deep shadowed English lane 

Across the blue lagoon. 

" The water street where oarsmen meet 

And shout ahead. 
The glowing quay, all noise and glee, 
Seemed hallowed as when angels' feet 

Touched Jacob's stony bed. 

" On pearly dome and princely home 

Day's glory dies : 
Once more the bells' low murmur tells 
That faith is not a line of foam 

Nor life a bridge of sighs." 

The religious note here sounded is the one most 
characteristic of the author's mood, and is reechoed 
in a majority of the pieces that make up his volume. 

A sort of vivid subjectivity, which makes it fairly 
clear that the verses are something more than fabrica- 
tions — are in some degree the distillation of expe- 
rience — is characteristic of "The Dead Friendship, 
and Other Poems," by Mr. Litchfield Woods. We 
may illustrate this statement by quoting the deeply- 
felt stanzas entitled " This My Heart." 

" In this my heart I find a mimic world 
Of love and hate, and happiness and tears. 
The joys and sorrows of the earth lie furled 
Within its subtle deeps. With hopes and fears 
Its wide domain I conquer and explore, 
Of sin and goodness finding more and more 
In this my heart. 

" In this my heart I stand upon the height 
.Where God his state in love and beauty keeps ; 
In this my heart I dwell in unstarred night 
Of sin and horror. Sinking to the deeps 
Of blackest Hell I find my spirit's kin. 
There lies all beauty, love and hate and sin 
In this my heart. 



" In this my heart are gardens of delight. 
And caverns vile of ruin and decay. 
With this my heart I plumb the darkest night. 
And span the brightness of a fairer day. 
There dwells enshrined a blessing and a curse, 
The beauty and horror of the universe. 
In this my heart." 

A strain of melancholy, and a tendency to brood 
over the darker aspects of life, lead us to suspect 
that Mr. Woods is still a comparatively yoimg poet. 
Whether he has realized, or only anticipates, the 
evanescence of the flush of joy that comes with 
early years we are not prepared to say, but it is cer- 
tain that "Youth's Farewell" expresses the mood 
of this critical transition in terms of singular beauty. 
The poem is too long to reproduce, save for its clos- 
ing stanzas. 

" Ah ! on her eyes in fondness dwell, 
Beyond those orbs is fairyland ; 
Ah ! look and take a long farewell, 
Upon the fragile hand 
Breathe out thy yearning in a trembling kiss, 
Breathe out youth's soul and so youth's dreams dismiss. 

" One long last kiss, one long last look 
Into those heart-compelling eyes, 
And youth is but a closed book. 
Life's morning splendour dies ; 
Ne'er will return its rapture and its zest, 
Though oft desired in memory's unrest. 

" Ah ! youth, thy moments fly too soon. 

Though pure and bright, yet brief the trance, 
Come turn thy face towards the noon, 
Bid farewell to romance ; 
The daylight grows, life's morning rapture dies, 
Whilst others throng to feed upon those eyes." 

Of the sonnets in this volume we must quote one 
example, "The Unattainable." 

" With heart insurgent 'neath my clasped hands, 
With weary eyes on far horizons fed ; 
My spirit wanders in enchanted lands 
Where pale rose dawns and amber sunsets shed 
Eternal loveliness ; where all my dreams 
Walk with glad eyes the shining courts of gold; 
And where my hopes, transfigured in the beams 
Of purest light, arise and cry, ' Behold, 
We give thee all the dreams of thy desire, 
Release thy spirit from its prison bars, 
Thou canst outsoar the sunset's amber fire, 
Reap for thy soul the heavens' wealth of stars ; 
And gaze forever with unwearied eyes 
On far horizons where new realms arise.' " 

This is one of some score of sonnets, all in the 
Shakespearian form, and all of unusual distinction. 
Miss May Aldington's verses are called "Songs 
of Life and Love," the two terms being taken as 
coextensive, as far as this little volume reports. 
" Love Watches " is the name given to the following 
pair of stanzas. 

" I watch the blue veins in your hands. 

With ever wondering longing ; 

I watch the red blood in your lips. 

And feel mj' pulses throbbing. 

" I watch the sea, the earth, the sun, 
God's wonders in the making ; 
But for the love-light in your eyes, 
I watch with heart Ihat 's breaking."

To this lyrist, an assonance seems quite as good as 
a rhyme, and she freely uses it as a substitute. 

The two ladies who merge their separate indi- 
vidualities into the imagined character of "Michael 
Field" have earned for that name the sincere ap- 
plause of all lovers of poetry. For a quarter of a 
century volumes thus ascribed have made their 
appearance in a continuing series, and the latest of 
them, "Wild Honey from Various Thyme," is no 
whit inferior to its predecessors. Here are nearly 
two hundred lyrics and sonnets, packed with thought, 
and arresting in their originality of expression. Let 
us take, to begin with, this truly Emersonian crys- 
tallization of an idea. 

" But if our love be dying let it die 
As the rose shedding secretly, 
Or as a noble music's pause : 
Let it move rhythmic as the laws 
Of the sea's ebb, or the sun's ritual 
When sovereignly he dies : 
Then let a mourner rise and three times call 
Upon our love, and the long echoes fall." 

Classical myths, sometimes set forth by bare de- 
scriptive process and sometimes moralized, are the 
subjects of a large number of these poems. We 
select " Mintha " for our illustration. 

" Dusk Mintha, purple-eyed, I love thy story — 

Where was the grove, 
Beneath what alder-strand, or poplar hoary 
Did silent Hades look to thee of love ? 
Mute wert thou, ever mute, nor did'st thou start 
Affrighted from thy doom, but in thy heart 
Did'st bury deep thy god. Persephone 
Passed thee by slowly on her way to hell ; 
And seeing Death so sore beloved of thee 
She sighed, and not in anger wrought the spell 

Fixed thee a plant 
, Of low, close blossom, of supprest perfume, 

And leaves that pant 
Urgent as if from spices of a tomb." 

The following sonnet is called " Constancy," and 
the idea has rarely found as striking an expression. 

" I love her with the seasons, with the winds, 
As the stars worship, as anemones 
Shudder in secret for the sun, as bees 
Buzz round an open flower : in all kinds 
My love is perfect, and in each she finds 
Herself the goal : then why, intent to teaze 
And rob her delicate spirit of its ease, 
Hastes she to range me with inconstant minds ? 
If she should die, if I were left at large 
On earth without her — I, on earth, the same 
Quick mortal with a thousand cries, her spell 
She fears would break. And I confront the charge 
As sorrowing, and as careless of my fame 
As Christ intact before the infidel." 

One more sonnet, this time a pure interpretation of 
nature, shall end our extracts from this significant 
collection. It has " Inept " for a title. 

" What is the burthen of this gold sunshine 
That burns across the wideness of decay, 
Or stamps its splendour on the forest pine. 
Or lifts — a token torch — one sweet-fern spray ? 
Why would it brand so deep ? The meadows spread 
Untamishable in their pomp of dew, 
Or frost, or clear meridian : overhead 



Droppeth the night ; but one must creep into 

The brake to hide one from the harvest moon. 

So wide she stares. Great stars that shed no boon 

Flame through the orchard apples laid in heaps. 

Why this profusion of September fire 

Poured where the thistle in the tilth grows higher, 

Laid over the broad fields where no man reaps ? " 

Such work as this produces the gratifying effect of 
dry champagne upon a palate cloyed by the exces- 
sive sweetness of most ordinary verse. 

At discreet intervals during the last score of years 
Mr. Robert Underwood Johnson has put forth modest 
volumes of verse which have charmed thoughtful 
readers by their grace and sincerity. Now that we 
have the contents of these volumes (with a few 
additional pieces) brought within a single pair of 
covers, we realize with some surprise how great a 
quantity of good work the author has done, and how 
considerable a poet he is. This is clearly a case in 
which the effect of the whole is greater than the sum 
of the effects produced by the several parts. For 
one thing, the collective volume shows us the sur- 
prising breadth of the poet's range. There are lyrics 
of nature and life, sage moralizings, and poems of 
personal and occasional character in great number 
and variety. Then there is the important group of 
poems inspired by patriotic and historical themes. 
And then, best of all to our liking, there are the 
many pieces which reveal the writer as a whole- 
hearted lover of Italy. We are going to quote 
" Love in Italy " as an exquisite example, although 
the lyric is now many years old, and is perhaps as 
familiar as anything Mr. Johnson has ever written. 

" They halted at the terrace wall ; 

Below, the towered city lay ; 
The valley in the moonlight's thrall 

Was silent in a swoon of May. 
As hand to hand spoke one soft word 

Beneath the friendly ilex-tree, 
They knew not, of the flame that stirred, 

What part was Love, what Italy. 

'• They knew what makes the moon more bright 

Where Beatrice and Juliet, — 
The sweeter perfume in the night, 

The lovelier starlight in the star ; 
And more that glowing hour did prove, 

Beneath the sheltering ilex-tree, — 
That Italy transfigures Love, 

As Love transfigures Italy." 

And now let us associate with this song the closing 
stanzas of a poem only a few weeks old — a poem 
in which the praise of Italy is conjoined with a 
tender tribute to a dead friend, " To One Who 
Never Got to Rome," to Edmund Clarence Stedman. 

" The path to Adonais' bed. 

That pilgrims ever smoother wear, 
Who could than you more fitly tread ? — 
Or with more right from Ariel dead 
The dark acanthus bear ? 

" Alas ! your footstep could not keep 

Your fond hope's rendezvous, brave soul ! 
Yet, if our last thoughts ere we sleep 
Be couriers across the deep 
To greet us at the goal,

" Who knows but now, aloof from ills. 
The heavenly vision that you see — 
The towers on the sapphire hills, 
The song, the golden light — fulfils 
Your dream of Italy ! " 

One of Mr. Johnson's sonnets, *' Waters of Song," 
may be reproduced as an illustration of the refine- 
ment and balanced grace of his work in general. 

" Time was when Avon's unrenownM stream, 
Save for its beauty, unregarded flowed ; 
Once Arno even as other rivers glowed, 
For then it had not mirrored Dante's dream. 
How vague the gray Levantine sea did seem 
Ere Homer charted all the stormy road! 
The Psalmist who by Babylon abode 
Forever linked with grief the willow's gleam. 

" Think you there are no other waters fit 
To be rechristened with a poet's name ? 
Is Nature bankrupt ? — man's last beacon lit ? 

Believe it never ! Unborn bards such fame 
On undiscovered rivers may bestow 

As shall to fable banish Nile and Po." 

The " Lyrics and Landscapes " of Mr. Harrison S. 
Morris are neat and decorous compositions, not ex- 
actly inspired, but mildly pleasing. These verses on 
" Beach Peas " may be quoted. 

*' Here, where the sand and the sea 
Caress, and forever embrace. 
You have bloomed, as a child that may be 
The fruit of their race. 

" You were bom to the drench of the salt. 
To the murmur of waves in the night. 
To the scream of gulls through the vault, 
And to foam that falls white. 

" For the purple you wear in your hood, 
And the lace of your leaves, are a sign 
You are sprung of imperial blood — 
Tho' of lowlier line." 

Mr. Morris strikes his deepest note in " Destiny," a 
Phi Beta Kappa poem, although we regret to find in 
these dignified verses a veiled apology for our latter- 
day American imperialism. 

Mr. Clinton ScoUard is by way of becoming the 
most voluminous of our poets (with Mr. Madison 
Cawein for a close competitor), if we reckon by the 
number of his volumes. The latest of the long series 
is called " Voices and Visions." We reproduce this 
lyric of the springtide. 

" There 's necromancy still ! 
The rathe marsh-marigold 
An Ophir makes of yonder oozy mold ; 
Slim branches erewhile stark and dark and chill, — 
The wild wayfaring-tree, ^ 
(Oh, wondrous wizardry !) 
Offer a fragrant Hybla where the bee 
May drink his greedy fill ! 
Care must attend whatever path you tread, 
Lest your foot crush some fair and fragile head. 
Shatter white innocence, leave budding hope 
Bruised on the dewy slope. 
But yester night 

All the wide earth lay barren of delight 
That now is splendid-bright before the sight. 
And so, my masters, say whatso you will. 
There 's necromancy still i " 

Of such pretty futilities as this is the book made up 
— songs of nature and love, and new echoes of the 
author's Oriental sojournings. 



Is Mr. ScoUard to be the founder of a Clinton 
school of poets ? For here is another volume from 
that vicinage, bearing the title "From Happy 
Valleys," and written by Mr. Thomas S. Jones, Jr. 
This " Nocturne " exemplifies the author's quiet and 
graceful manner. 

" Sleep after love is done — afar the west 
Smiles softly, though the sun has sunk to rest — 

Ah, this were best ; 
The flaming noon-hour we shall never know, 
No more, the glow. 

" Sleep after love is done and peace at last. 
Beyond, the wind-swept sea, the stormy blast, 

All, all is past ; 
The harbor calm, the ships home from the deep, 
And we, asleep I " 

Mr. Jones is a poet of nature, and has felt the 
soothing ministi-ies of woods and fields and skies. 
His verse, moreover, is freighted with enough of 
imagination to be truly significant of the life of the 
spirit. 

We have had occasion to speak words of praise 
concerning the two earlier volumes of verse by Mrs. 
Helen Hay Whitney, and her new book of " Gypsy 
Verses " shows that delicate sensibility and subtle 
emotion are still at her command. The following 
exquisite little poem is called " Ghosts." 

" The long lost lights of love I know, 
They thrill from ultimate space, they blow 
Like small bewildered stars, tossed high 
On some unknown and passionate sky. 

" I know them for the loved lost lights 
That made the glamour of my nights 
Long, long ago, and now I fear 
Their coming, and the garb they wear. 

" For they are very white and cold, 
They are not coloured as of old. 
In trailing radiance, rose and red. 
For these are ghosts, and they are dead." 

There is imaginative distinction in these verses, and 
in many of the others that keep them company. 

Ralegh's devotional stanzas on *' His Pilgrim- 
age " supply Miss Caroline Hazard with the title, 
" A Scallop Shell of Quiet," which she has given to 
her own volume of devotional verse. Most of the 
pieces are sonnets, and " Seed-Time " may be taken 
to represent them. 

" A living green has touched the swelling hills, 
And tiny birds chirp in the leafless trees ; 
Up from the ocean comes a vernal breeze 
That brings the showers to feed the mountain rills. 
In dark red soil the steady ploughman drills 
The long deep furrows, sinking to his knees 
In spongy earth ; it is no time of ease, — 
With signs of birth and promise Nature thrills. 

Drive Thou Thy plough, Lord, deep in my heart, 
Hardened beneath a load of petty cares ; 
Break up its guilty crust, and freely start 

The showers of Thy grace, then sow some seed 
Whose ripened harvest Thou wilt deign to heed. 
And husband it with g^racious heavenly airs." 

These lines are typical of the feeling which charac- 
terizes Miss Hazard's verse, lending it the grace of 
a deep sincerity. William Morton Patne.

Briefs on New Books. 



New studies of ^here are certain authors whose 
Blake, Keats, stability and discrimination in judg- 
Scott, Shelley, ment are always assured ; we recog- 
nize their distinct merits and limitations, and are 
seldom disappomted in their products. Sometimes 
such evenness, especially in a critical essayist, sug- 
gests a craftsman rather than a scholar ; but a tone 
of earnest appreciation quite counteracts any such 
mechanical effects. Mr. Stopford Brooke has 
achieved the skill of the craftsman, without losing 
his individual traits as a critic with a keen perception 
of literary art. His earlier studies of Browning and 
Tennyson have been followed by other volumes in 
uniform style, covering a wider range of subjects. 
His new " Studies in Poetry " ( Putnam) include 
essays on Blake, Keats, Scott, and three on Shelley. 
The studies of Shelley impress the reader as the 
most vital, and they seem to furnish the special 
reason for the book. If the tone of the " Inaugural 
Address to the Shelley Society " is occasionally open 
to censure for petulance in recalling the comparisons 
which have been made between Shelley and Byron, 
the later pages of the essay are sound in balanced 
criticism on both poets. Mr. Brooke emphasizes 
his admiration for Shelley's lyrics in this inaugural 
address, and expands the hints there stated into a 
worthy essay on the same subject. He justly calls 
attention to Shelley's absorbing impulses of thought 
and emotions which left their impress not only on 
the shorter lyrics but also in lyrical outbursts in many 
of the dramas, notably " Prometheus," " HeUas," 
and " Epipsychidion." A separate essay is devoted 
to the last-mentioned personal poem. There are 
some new interpretative thoughts and fitting re- 
phrasing 6f recognized qualities of mind and soul 
in the detailed analyses of "The Cloud" and "Ode 
to the West Wind." Two distinctive traits of 
Shelley are summarized as " the power of making 
fresh myths out of nature, and that of describing 
nature imaginatively and yet with scientific truth." 
Keats and Shelley suggest to most critics both resem- 
blance and divergence. The author has here traced 
the mental isolation of Keats from the political and 
material struggles of his age, his reversion to ideals 
and symbols of classic and mediaeval beauty, and 
his childlike sensibility to nature. With almost 
ecstatic praise he commends his best odes as "above 
criticism, pure gold of poetry — virgin gold." The 
publication of the complete poems of William Blake 
in a new edition two years ago re-awakened interest 
in this painter-poet who was both visionary and 
radical and whose recognition has come so slowly. 
Mr. Brooke has studied Blake's lyrical poetry in 
relation to the development of English literature; 
he has also emphasized his spiritual love of nature, 
which made him a true precursor of Wordsworth. 
Blake's poetic passion informed and beautified many 
of his meditations on the political, social, and relig- 
ious problems of his day. The quotations which 
reveal the poet's childlike yet progressive nature are 



well chosen from " Poetical Sketches," " Songs of 
Innocence," and " Songs of Experience." Many a 
reader in middle life will echo the sentence in the 
essay on Sir Walter Scott, " I am sorry for the chil- 
dren who are not brought up on the poetry of Scott." 
With just appreciation, this poetry is extolled for its 
power of kindling romantic feelings and imaginative 
delights over past scenes, and for awakening fervor 
to learn more of historic scenes, heroic characters, 
and knightly ideals. 

Chapters in ^^^ ^^^^^^^^ instalment (Volume III.) 
the struggle for of Professor James MacKinnon's 
human liberty, u History of Modem Liberty " ( Long- 
mans, Green, & Co.), the first two volumes of which 
were reviewed in The Dial a year ago, deals with 
the struggle with the Stuarts in England and Scot- 
land in the seventeenth century, and is a continua- 
tion of an ambitious task already well advanced ; 
namely, the tracing of the historical development of 
liberty in modern times. The first volume, it may 
be repeated, was of an introductory character, being 
limited to a review of the origin and results of the 
movements for political and social emancipation in 
the middle ages. The second volume dealt primarily 
with the intellectual and religious movements as 
exemplified in the Renaissance and Reformation and 
their results upon the political and social life of the 
time. The present volume is to be followed by five 
others, concluding with the revolutionary and eman- 
cipation movements in the nineteenth century. The 
scene of the struggle described in the earlier volumes 
was mainly on the continent ; after that it was shifted 
to England and Scotland, where the new impulse 
received its most powerful expression. There the 
contest began with the opposition of parliament to 
the arbitrary rule of James I., was continued during 
the reign of Charles II., included the opposition to 
the " military despotism " of Cromwell, and ended 
with the abdication of James II. The struggle was 
marked by such incidents as Milton's plea for intel- 
lectual freedom, the efforts of Roger Williams, 
William Penn, John Locke, and others, in behalf of 
toleration, and the demand of certain obscure sects 
for social as well as religious emancipation. In 
Great Britain the struggle produced important re- 
sults; it gave her the first place among the full 
countries of Europe, transformed her into a land of 
refuge for the exiles of other nations, and helped to 
foster " those larger aspirations which resulted in 
the widening of political rights, the broadening of 
intellectual and religious liberty, and contributed to 
engender that free self-consciousness, that spirit of 
daring enterprise, which led to the expansion of 
British power and the establishment of free common- 
wealth beyond the British shores." The same criti- 
cism which was directed against the earlier volumes 
may be made of the present one ; namely, that much 
of the story deals only in a remote degree with liberty, 
and that the author's failure to cite his authorities 
detracts from the value of the work to serious students 
of history.

[August 1, 



2%cp«^^ima«aJe Fourteen years ago Mr. Charles 
0/ Chatterton's Edward Russell undertook the study 
life and work. jj£ Chatterton's strangely puzzling 
life and literary work. Bristol, the boy-poet's home, 
the British Museum, the Bodleian Library, and all 
other sources of possible information about his sub- 
ject, have been visited by the biographer, and all 
extant documentary evidence has been examined ; 
and as a result we now have a handsomely printed 
and illustrated volume entitled " Thomas Chatter- 
ton, the Marvelous Boy" (Moffat, Yard & Co.). 
In his very preface Mr. Russell damages his case 
by claiming too much. Not only does he roundly 
deny that Chatterton was guilty of literary forgery, 
but he pronounces his writings " works of the first 
order of genius, works ever since the marvel of all 
persons that have considered them, works profoundly 
affecting the body and the development of English 
poetry." With a lurking fear, however, that he 
may not have succeeded in proving his client's in- 
nocence and in shifting all the blame on to the 
antiquary-surgeon Barrett and the hard-hearted 
Horace Walpole, he amusingly adds that if the 
wonderful boy was a literary forger he had tempta- 
tion enough and excuse enough, and we ought now 
to forgive him and remember only his lovable 
qualities and his undisputed literary genius. The 
lovable qualities we can admire without being told, 
on what authority does not appear, that whenever 
he passed the throng of beggars in front of Colston's 
school, on his way to get a book from the circulating 
library, " he emptied his pockets among them," and 
so denied himself the book for which his soul was 
thirsting, and so also found himself compelled to 
carry more parchments, genuine or forged, to 
Surgeon Barrett. " On a calm survey," says the 
author, as if forgetting that he is washing Chatterton 
as white as snow, " the only real amazement will 
be that this boy did nothing worse than palm off his 
counterfeit antiques upon two foolish men." The 
advocate protests too much ; he lacks the calmness 
of conviction, and so fails to convince the reader. 
The interest, too, of his story — and Chatterton's 
life can never fail to be interesting — suffers from 
its disputatious tone ; it is told with an emphasis that 
seems to leave no reserve forces behind. Masson's 
short and pathetic account, which Mr. Russell makes 
no mention of in his references to previous biog- 
raphers, is more effective than this later, more 
elaborate, and undoubtedly better-informed work, 
although the thoroughness with which the author 
prepared himself for it is worthy of high praise. 



A new brief 
biography 
of Foe, 



" As we are human," writes Mr. John 
Macy in beginning his life of Edgar 
Allan Poe, in the " Beacon Biog- 
raphies " series (Small, Maynard & Co.), " we crave 
to know when Shakespeare was married, arid on 
what occasions Poe befuddled his fine brain ; but 
the Poe that lives is the dreamer of dreams imaged 
in the pensive head that adorns the University of 



Virginia." Sympathy with poets, the writer further 
declares, should transcend defense of their private 
morals. Perhaps so ; but even with the best of 
endeavors to maintain the cool literary temper, a 
warmer human interest will make the reader regret 
Byron's irregularities, Shelley's untenderness to his 
first wife, and Poe's lack of manly self-control. This 
very natural interest of ours in a poet as a human 
being Mr. Macy recognizes so far as to touch on the 
main facts of Poe's troubled life ; and of the weak- 
ness that chiefly caused it to be troubled he says 
an illuminating word. Correcting those who call 
Poe's infirmity alcoholism or dipsomania, he says : 
" Alcoholism is disease resulting from excessive 
drinking : anyone may develop it with perseverance. 
Dipsomania is an uncontrollable thirst for alcohol : 
it exists as a disease, even if the thirst is not gratified. 
There is yet a third condition which can exist with- 
out excessive or continuous indulgence and without 
an initial morbid craving. Under this condition the 
' patient ' is affected by alcohol and other drugs as 
if he were a cold-blooded animal. There is imme- 
diate unbalance, hysteria, insanity, a poisoned con- 
dition. Such, according to the evidence, was the 
effect of liquor on Poe." Mr. Macy's essay — for it 
is, of necessity, hardly more — dwells rather on Poe 
the short-story writer than on Poe the poet. The 
short story, moreover, he unhesitatingly pronounces 
" the only type of literature to which America has 
made a considerable contribution of distinguished 
quality." Has anyone noted the curious parallelism 
between Poe and Whistler in their whimsical fibbing 
over birth-place and birth-year? Each falsely claimed 
Baltimore as birthplace, and both were shy about 
giving their age. Both, too, were for a brief space 
students at West Point, if history is to be believed. 
This last is noted by Mr. Macy. His little book 
sustains the general excellence of the series to which 

it belongs.

climbing. Qf ^\^\g^ gng jg more than half per- 

suaded after reading Mr. Frederic Harrison's book, 
" My Alpine Jubilee " (Smith, Elder & Co.), which 
is made up of ten short articles and letters, most of 
them reprinted from the " Cornhill Magazine," the 
" Westminster Review," and " The Times." The 
volume opens with six letters written home last 
autumn from Lake Leman, fifty-six years after the 
writer's first visit to the Alps in his student days. 
It is cheering to find Mr. Harrison still as keen as 
ever for a tramp (if not too arduous) in the moun- 
tains, and far more appreciative of their charms than 
in his youth, rich in adventure and ever fresh delights 
though those early days of summit-scaling are 
acknowledged to have been. The middle altitudes 
must now content him, but what they have to offer 
was largely missed in those former mad scrambles 
to reach the topmost peaks. But even in that far- 
off time of half a century ago Mr. Harrison was no 
unobservant mountain-climber. Two articles written

in the sixties and reprinted at the end of the little 
book show him to have had a quick eye and a reflec- 
tive mind for all that the Alps had to offer. Of 
course the volume does not close without due men- 
tion of and tribute to the late Leslie Stephen, his 
feUow-member in the Alpine Club. Besides dedi- 
cating the book to his memory, Mr. Harrison 
republishes his " CornhiU " article written on the 
occasion of Stephen's death. " The Playground of 
Europe," we are glad to notice, is praised as its 
author's most characteristic and fascinating work. 
One sentence from Mr. Harrison's final chapter may 
be quoted as striking the keynote of the book : " We 
need sometimes that poetry should be not droned 
into our ears, but flashed into our senses." 

The creed of ^^® Thomas Paine, who said, "My 
a citizen of country is the world, and my religion 
the world. ig to ^o good," Professor Charles 
Zueblin allows himself to be fettered by no preju- 
dices of race or creed — so far as freedom from preju- 
dice is possible. His little book, " The Religion of 
a Democrat" (Huebsch), is the most untheological 
treatise imaginable : the religion it treats of is extrar 
ecclesiastical, if not anti-theological, and appears to 
be contained in some form of socialism. Positivism, 
says the author, " has had its day ; ethical culture 
still illumines the way, but the future seems to be- 
long to some form of socialism. If the democratic 
state is at all to realize the dreams of sober collec- 
tivists, and to avoid the dangers pointed out by the 
honest critics of socialism, it will be by the organi- 
zation of its ethical forces, in harmony with its other 
elements." The truly religious person of this ideal 
democracy is not to cherish hopes of a future state 
of celestial bliss, but to be sustained and strength- 
ened by a belief in " impersonal immortality," which 
means " the perpetuation of oneself through the 
individuals, the institutions, and the ideals, of the 
years to come." Furthermore, "the people are to 
redeem themselves. Our ashes fertilize the soil from 
which life springs, but souls also kindle souls. I do 
not know when my Redeemer will live, or whose 
Redeemer I may be, except in the sense in which 
every man is our Redeemer and we are his Re- 
deemer. . . . The redemption of the people will be 
by means of impersonal immortality, — the crux 
of democratic religion." Although the scheme of 
salvation by legislation must seem a little hard and 
mechanical, the atmosphere of the book is fresh and 
free and bracing, and the author's forcible presenta- 
tion of the imperishability of personal influence will 
doubtless inspire others with a wish to " join the 
choir invisible." 

The choice of ^r. John Corbin's book, "Which 
a college for College for the Boy ?" (Houghton) 
theyouny. jg YcxsidiQ up of articles contributed to 

the " Saturday Evening Post " and widely read and 
commented on at the time of their appearance. The 
universities and colleges discussed and compared are 
Princeton, Harvard (the author's alrna mater), 



Michigan, Cornell, Chicago, Wisconsin, Beloit, and 
Knox — the two latter being briefly treated in a 
single chapter entitled " The Small College versus 
the University." As six out of these eight institu- 
tions are co-educational, the book may serve in a 
measure to answer also the question, " Which college 
for the girl ? " But no one, the author probably 
least of all, would claim that the little volume gives 
a final answer to either of these important questions. 
The social and athletic sides of college life receive 
from him more attention than the academic, and 
there is rather greater emphasis placed on the defects 
than on the excellences of the several institutions he 
has selected. The chapters are highly readable, and 
the style in which they are written is sufficiently 
enlivened with student wit and college slang. The 
author's year of residence at Oxford, and his visits 
at a large number of American universities and 
colleges, qualify him to speak with authority on cer- 
tain aspects of college life ; and if the careful parent 
wishes to learn something about the peculiar tempta- 
tions his son will be exposed to at any of the uni- 
versities in Mr. Corbin's list, the socual advantages 
he will enjoy, the athletic sports most in vogue, and 
(in a general way) the departments of learning most 
successfully cultivated, he will do well to read this 
attractive, well-illustrated book. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



M. Andr^ Tardieu is the latest of our European 
critics. His "Notes sur les Etats-Unis " (Paris: 
Calmann-Levy) are neither extensive nor profound, but, 
coming from the pen of a literary Frenchman, they 
make a readable book. M. Tardieu seems to have had 
the usual experience of the visiting foraigner who comes 
armed with letters to public functionaries and social 
leaders. He was shown the obvious sights, and makes 
the obvious comments upon them. His special themes 
are society, politics, and diplomacy, and his observations 
are confined mainly to New York, Boston, and Wash- 
ington. The book exhibits a good deal of timeliness, 
dealing at length, as it does, with such recent matters 
as the Japanese imbroglio (which is taken far too seri- 
ously), the panic of last Autmnn, and the earlier stages 
of the now pending presidential campaign. 

We believe that Mr. Morley is henceforth to be called 
Viscount Morley of Blackburn, and we expect hereafter 
to give him his proper title, but there seems to be no 
need of our doing so in mentioning the fourth volume 
of his " Miscellanies " (Macmillan) which still prints 
plain " John Morley " upon the title-page. We pre- 
sume this is done to secure uniformity with the earlier 
volumes. The present book is a collection of papers 
reprinted from various sources, and the author's friends 
doubtless know them already, although they are doubt- 
less also glad to have them in this permanent shape. 
Machiavelli, Guicciardini, Mill, and Lecky are the 
subjects of four of the essays. These, with three 
others, make up an " Eversley " volume like the old 
ones, only the paper seems les« soft and flexible.

[August 1, 



I^OTES. 



A new and complete edition of Mr. Madison Cawein's 
poetry, in five volumes, with an introduction by Mr. 
Edmund Gosse, is announced by the Bobbs-Merrill 
Company. 

With the title, " Good Citizenship," the Henry 
Altemus Co. publish a small volume containing the two 
Chicago addresses made in 1903 and 1907 by the late 
Grover Cleveland. 

Miss Elizabeth Robins, author of " Come and Find 
Me " and " The Magnetic North," has completed a new 
novel to appear during the Fall under the title, " The 
Mills of the Gods." 

" The Appreciation of the Drama," by Mr, Charles H. 
Caffin, will soon be added to the Baker & Taylor Co.'s 
excellent " Appreciation " series, which already includes 
volumes on music and art. 

An English book which should prove of unusual inter- 
est to Americans is "George III., as Man, Monarch, 
and Statesman," by Mr. Heckles Willson, to which 
Messrs. Jacobs & Co. have obtained the rights for this 
country. 

Two small volumes of Newman reprints, published by 
Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co., give us " The Church 
of the Fathers " and " University Teaching," the latter 
volume being the first part of Newman's " The Idea of 
a University." 

Professor Sidney G. Ashmore has edited "The 
Comedies of Terence " for college students, and the 
volume is published at the Oxford University Press. 
Professor Tyrrell's text is followed, and both introduc- 
tion and notes are elaborate. 

" A Guide to the Paintings in the Churches and Minor 
Museums of Florence," by Miss Maud Cruttwell, is an 
illustrated handbook that the art student will do well 
to take with him on his Italian pilgrimage. Messrs. 
E. P. Button & Co. are the publishers. 

" A History of the Ancient Egyptians," by Professor 
James H. Breasted, now published by the Messrs. 
Scribner, is a condensation of the author's longer work, 
and, as such, provides a brief and authoritative account 
of the subject in the light of the most advanced scholar- 
ship. 

Mr. Charles Lane Hanson's « English Composition," 
published by Messrs. Ginn & Co., is the latest of the 
long series of books prepared for the use of high school 
beginners. It supplies the usual blend of rhetoric with 
English grammar, and is plentifully provided with exer- 
cises. 

Mr. Edward Augustus George is the author of a vol- 
ume of essays on " Seventeenth Century Men of Lati- 
tude," meaning such foreruimers of the liberalized 
modern theology as Chillingworth, Taylor, Browne, and 
Baxter. The book is published by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. 

The Letters of Edward Lear, the famous author of 
" The Book of Nonsense," will appear next Fall with the 
imprint of Messrs. Duffield & Co. The volume is to be 
edited by Lady Strachey, and will contain Lear's letters 
descriptive of his journeys as a painter to Corfu, Mount 
Athos, and Albania. 

Besides the new special edition of " Little Women " 
lately issued, Messrs. Little, Brown & Co. have in 
preparation for early Fall publication a new illustrated 
edition of Miss Alcott's " Spinning Wheel Series," which 



includes the four volumes entitled " Spinning Wheel 
Stories," " Silver Pitchers," " Proverb Stories," and " A 
Garland for Girls." These four books are all to be 
printed from new plates, and will have new and attrac- 
tive illustrations and cover designs. 

One of the most important of forthcoming biographies 
will be Mr. Ferris Greenslet's Life of Thomas Bailey 
Aldrich, a large octavo volume which promises to be 
very rich in letters. The illustrations will be portraits, 
pictures of the author's home at various periods of his 
life, and other views. 

A volume on " How to Appreciate Prints," by Mr. 
Frank Weiterkampf, Curator of the Print Department 
of the New York Public Library, is announced by 
Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co. They will also publish an 
elaborately illustrated book by Miss Elisabeth Luther 
Cary entitled " Artists Past and Present." 

A leading place among the coming season's publica- 
tions will undoubtedly be taken by the authorized biog- 
raphy of James McNeill Whistler, which Miss Elizabeth 
Robins and Mr. Joseph Pennell have long been working 
upon. The J. B. Lippincott Co. will publish the work 
in two large and elaborately-illustrated volumes. 

Very little has hitherto been written about that inter- 
esting and quaint people, the Servians. Messrs. Page & 
Co. will publish shortly a work entitled " Servia and 
the Servians," by M. Shedo Mijatovich, which is said to 
give a very vivid account of the religious and social life, 
the institutions and the traditions of the Servian folk. 

Marx's "Value, Price, and Profit," edited by Mrs. 
Aveling, and Herr Paul Kampffmeyer's " Changes in 
the Theory and Tactics of the (German) Social- 
Democracy," translated by Mr. W. R. Gaylord, are two 
small volumes for the furthering of the socialist propa- 
ganda, recently published by Messrs. Charles H. Kerr 
& Co. 

Fletcher's "The Knight of the Burning Pestle," 
edited and very copiously annotated by Dr. Herbert S. 
Murch, is a new volume of the " Yale Studies in English," 
published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. This volume 
is similar in form to those which have given us, in the 
same series, critical editions of a number of Jonson's 
comedies. 

Miss Anne Bush Maclear's monograph on " Early 
New England Towns " will be found useful by teachers 
and students of American history. The special subjects 
discussed are courts, finances, public lands, schools, the 
church, and the government. This work is published 
by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. for Columbia 
University. 

New books of essays by Dr. Samuel M. Crothers, 
Miss Agnes Repplier, and Professor Bliss Perry are 
promised for publication during the coming season by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin Company. They will also 
publish important new books by President Charles W. 
Eliot, Professor George H. Palmer, Dr. Lyman Abbott, 
and Professor Paul H. Hanus. 

The Providence Club for Colonial Reprints has repro- 
duced, in an edition limited to one hundred copies, the 
"Invitation Serieuse aux Habitants des Illinois," by 
"Un Habitant des Kaskaskias," as first published at 
Philadelphia in 1772. The reprint is a facsimile, and 
the work has been edited by Messrs. Clarence Walworth 
Alvord and Clarence Edwin Carter. 

By special arrangement with the English publishers, 
the H. M. Caldwell Co. will issue in September " The 
Century Shakespeare," complete in forty volumes, with 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

an exhaustive introduction to each volume by Dr. F. J. 
Furnjvall. Each volume will also include a full and 
comprehensive glossary and a complete series of notes. 
An important feature of the " Century Shakespeare " 
will be an up-to-date and popular account of Shake- 
speare's life and work by Dr. Furnivall and Mr. John 
Munro. 

The Macmillan Co. publish for the University of 
Michigan a monograph, by Miss Orma Fitch Butler, 
entitled " Studies in the Life of Heliogabalus." This 
Roman unworthy might, we should imagine, make the 
subject of an interesting book: we may hardly thus 
describe Miss Butler's production, which is a typical 
example of unreadable seminar-literature. 

"Government by the People," by Mr. Robert H. 
Fuller, is a small book published by the Macmillan Co. 
It gives an accoimt of the laws and customs regulating 
the election system and the formation and control of 
political parties in the United States. It is a book that 
every first voter, to say nothing of hardened practitioners 
in politics, should read and seriously ponder over. 

" Ohio before 1850," being a study of the early influ- 
ence of Pennsylvania and southern populations in Ohio, 
written by Dr. Robert E. Chaddock, is a recent Columbia 
University monograph published by Messrs. Longmans, 
Green, & Co. Other publications in the same series 
are " Factory Legislation in Maine," by Mr. E. Stagg 
Whitin ; " Consanguineous Marriages in the American 
Population," by Dr. George B. Louis Arner; and 
" Adolphe Quetelet as Statistician," by Dr. Frank H. 
Hankins. 

A Balzac Museum has begun to take form and sub- 
stance at Passy, the Parisian suburb where the novelist 
lived during his most productive period, from 1842 to 
1847. There, at 47 Rue Raynouard, the little house 
that Balzac hired for six hundred francs a year has been 
purchased by a group of his admirers and is to be turned 
into a public museum after the pattern of the Victor 
Hugo Museum in the Place des Vosges. It is proposed 
to furnish the house in the style of Louis Philippe's 
time, and to fill it with all sorts of Balzac relics. 
Balzac's former landlady is said to be still living at 
Passy and to be entertainingly communicative concerning 
her famous tenant. 

The untimely death of Professor Louis Dyer, follow- 
ing a surgical operation in London, about the middle of 
July, will be greatly deplored by the large circle of 
his friends and admirers in England and America. 
Though he had lived at Oxford for many years, and was 
a lecturer at Balliol College, Professor Dyer had re- 
tained his connection with America by correspondence, 
by occasional visits and lecture tours, and by his pub- 
lished letters. He was not one of Mr. Bernard Shaw's 
Greek scholars who know little Greek and nothing else. 
Before entering Harvard College he had studied in 
Europe. He graduated with final honors in modern 
languages as well as in classics, and he has always been 
honorably distinguished among American classicists 
for the breadth and range of his culture. He was for 
some years assistant professor of Greek at Harvard. 
His published works include an esteemed edition of 
Plato's " Apology " and " Crito,' a volume of studies in 
Greek religion and antiquities entitled " The Gods in 
Greece " (reviewed in The Dial for October, 1891), 
and a recent work on Machiavelli. In its earlier years, 
he was a valued contributor to The Dial. Professor 
Dyer was fifty-seven years of age.

ANNE OF GREEN GABLES 

THIRD LARGE EDITION 

Less than two months ago ANNE OF GREEN GABLES entered the world of fiction unheralded. Within a short 
time " not to know her will be to argue oneself unknown," — for the bright sayings of Anne are being repeated by one 
friend to another all over the land. "Anne is a triumph," says the Philadelphia Press. Illustrated. $1.50. 




BLISS CARMAN'S 

THE MAKING OF PERSONALITY 

" A beautiful contribution to that oldest of all the arts, the art of living, which we are all by reason of our existence 
compelled to face, but which none of us has ever succeeded in completely mastering. . . . Mr. Carman confesses 
himself a disciple of Maeterlinck and Santayana, but he is more of an out-door philosopher than either. He has 
caught the breezy spirit of Robert Louis Stevenson." — Current Literature. Boxed. $1.50. 



CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS'S 

THE HOUSE IN THE WATER 

" A new book of animal stories by Professor Roberts is something of an event for the lover of the woods. THE 
HOUSE IN THE WATER is a fascinating volume for every reader who loves the wilderness. There is atmosphere 
as well as imagination, but the latter does not carry the story-teller beyond the bounds of a reasonable probability." 
— The Brooklyn Eagle. Illustrated. $1.50. 



SERVIA AND THE SERVIANS 

Very little has hitherto been written about that interesting and quaint people, the Servians. In this book the author 
has given a very vivid account of the religious and social life, the institutions and the traditions of the Servian folk. 
At the time of the assassination of King Alexander in 1902, M. Mijatovich was Servian Minister at the Court of 
St. James. On all Servian afPairs he is a recognized authority, and there are few who are equally competent with 
him to tell the story of his countrymen. Cloth. Illustrated. Net $3.00. 



RACE OR MONGREL 

AMERICAN OR PAN-EUROPEAN? By Dr. ALFRED P. SCHULTZ 

A work on the necessity of race purity, of interest to the general reader as well as to the student of social science. 
From the most ancient civilization to our own times, according to the author, the cross-breeding of races is the evil 
which has caused and will continue to cause the downfall of nations. 8vo. Cloth. $2.50.

" The comprehensiveness and range of Mr. Lowell's work is one of the reasons for the unique place of his 
Government of England — for its place in a class by itself, with no other books either by British or non-British 
authors to which it can be compared. Another reason is the insight, which characterizes it throughout, into 
the spirit in which Parliament and the other representative institutions of England are worked, and the accuracy 
which so generally characterizes definite statements ; all contribute to make it of the highest permanent value 
to students of political science the world over." — Edward Pobritt in The Forum.

THE GRANDI SONI AN MANNER. 

In a paper from the pen of Lady Grove, 
published recently in the London " Chronicle," 
comment is made on the withdrawal of certain 
gentlemen from the " mixed " clubs ("cock and 
hen " clubs is the current slang term) to which 
they had belonged, and which they had joined 
while the clubs were still exclusively for men, 
but which they had left in high dudgeon at the 
subsequent admission of women — an innovation 
that they held to be destructive of the very 
raison d'etre of club life. That is, these gen- 
tlemen, one might argue, had joined their clubs 
in order to escape the amenities of polite society, 
and felt themselves aggrieved when called upon 
to observe those amenities. An acquaintance 
of ours who has no home ties and no fixed hab- 
itation of her own deplores her lot because she 
finds it irksome, as perpetual boarder or guest 
in other people's houses, to wear always her 
" company manners." 

This hatred of formality, this ever-present 
tendency to revert to primitive unconvention- 
ality (and primitive savagery), is neither wholly 
bad nor wholly good ; but in this rapidly-moving 
twentieth century of ours, when we fancy we 
have hardly time to be polite, the obvious dan- 
ger is that too little attention will be paid to the 
cultivation of the minor morals, of the suave 
and gracious manners that bespeak a cultured 
leisure. What better corrective to the rude 
haste, the selfish scramble, of a money-making 
age could be devised than a deliberate reading, 
or re-reading, of " Sir Charles Grandison " ? 
From one who " taught the passions to move 
at the command of virtue," as Johnson said of 
Richardson, the reader may take a lesson in 
the ordering of his daily walk and conversation. 
Nothing is too trivial to be treated with dig- 
nity and gravity by the excellent printer-author. 
" In these small instances," he makes one of his 
minor personages say, "are the characters of 
the heart displayed far more than in greater." 
To the men and women of Richardson's novels 
the little things of life are abundantly worth 
while. They hurry over nothing, they slight 
nothing. An old lady of Sir Walter Scott's 
acquaintance always chose " Sir Charles Gran- 
dison " to be read to her as she sat in her elbow

chair, because she knew that were she to fall 
asleep in the course of the reading she should 
lose nothing of the story, but should find the 
party where she left them, — conversing in " the 
cedar parlour." In the important things of life, 
as in courtship and marriage, the stately delib- 
eration is marvellous to behold. In paying his 
addresses to Harriet Byron, Sir Charles makes 
his advances by parallels, beginning with the 
estimable grandmother and redoubling his cau- 
tion as he approaches the citadel itself. His 
delicacy causes him to doubt whether Miss 
Byron will pardon, or should be permitted to 
pardon, an earlier passion cherished by him 
for the unfortunate Clementina della Porretta. 
But he takes Miss Byron's hand, and is bowing 
over it at page 65 of the sixth volume ; at page 
81 the actual offer of marriage begins, and it 
extends to page 89, the suitor talking almost 
uninterruptedly the while and (it is needless to 
add) expressing himself in admirable English. 

The priggishness of our paragon of a hero is 
of course undeniable, if one chooses to dwell 
on that aspect of his character. His delicacy 
amounts, to some readers, almost to effeminacy ; 
and hence he has been maliciously styled one of 
the author's principal female characters. Even 
the heroine finds fault with his faidtlessness. 
" A most intolerable superiority ! " she exclaims ; 
" I wish he would do something wrong, some- 
thing cruel." That is only uttered, however, 
under an overpowering sense of her own inferi- 
ority, or imagined inferiority. It is significant 
that Richardson at fii-st intended to call his book 
" The Good Man." 

That it purifies the heart and refines the 
manners to commune with the virtuous char- 
acters depicted by the author of " Pamela '' has 
been often enough asserted by his admirers. 
Diderot even found in Richardson's novels an 
intellectual stimulus of a high order. " I have 
observed," he declares, " that in a company 
where the works of Richardson are being read, 
either privately or aloud, the conversation at 
once becomes more interesting and animating." 
Diderot's seventeen pages of glowing evdogy in 
the Journal Etranger — a panegjo-ic inspired 
by the recent death of the novelist — can no 
longer be taken seriously ; yet there is some- 
thing rather pleasing in finding this keen-witted 
Frenchman so overcome with admiration for the 
worthy Englishman that he vows he will part 
with other portions of his library if he must, but 
Richardson he will keep — on the same shelf 
with Moses, Homer, Euripides, and Sophocles ; 
and he will read them by turns. 



There is an old-world charm in the very 
formality with which Richardson's characters 
address one another. Even to his sisters Grandi- 
son is always " Sir Charles," and they are not 
accosted by him as plain Charlotte or Caroline, 
but as " sister Charlotte," or "my dear Caro- 
line." Charlotte, on her part, habitually calls 
her elder sister " Lady L ," and her brother- 
in-law is either " Lord L " or " my lord." 

All the more amusing, as well as surprising, is 
it to catch Miss Grandison, in a moment of 
excessive familiarity and self-forgetfulness, ex- 
claiming, " Such another word, Harriet, and I'll 
blow you up ! " Again we detect her using the 
slang expression, "I'll be hanged if — ," an 
unseemliness for which the exemplary Miss 
Harriet fails not to call her to account in a 
gentle way. 

But by far the most edifying passages in the 
book are found in the conversations that Sir 
Charles carries on with the various characters of 
the story. Upon his father's death what could 
be more praiseworthy than the judicious resolve, 
concerning both parents, thus expressed to his 
cousin Everard : " I will have an elegant but not 
sumptuous monument erected to the memory of 
both, with a modest inscription that shall rather 
be matter of instruction to the living than a 
panegyric on the departed. The funeral shall 
be decent, but not ostentatious." And the fol- 
lowing, from a young man in his twenties, is 
unexceptionable (Sir Charles is addressing his 
two sisters and Miss Harriet Byron) : " Our 
passions may be made subservient to excellent 
purposes. Don *t think you have a supercilious 
brother. A susceptibility of the passion called 
Zove, I condemn not as a fault ; but the contrary. 
Your brother^ ladies, (looking upon all three,) is 
no Stoic." In the end, of course, he gracefully 
yields to his " susceptibility of the passion called 
Zot;e," and succeeds, with one entire volume to 
do it in, in getting married to the admirable 
Harriet ; but lest even then he should have left 
on the reader's mind some impression of un- 
seemly haste, he takes still another volume to 
make his exit from the stage in a leisurely and 
graceful and dignified manner. 

That he would never suffer his horses' tails to 
be docked is one, and a not insignificant, claim 
to our approval of Sir Charles. No smallest 
occasion to show his humanity was neglected by 
him ; and he found ways, some of them rather 
extraordinary, to do good and to smooth the path 
of life for others. For a profligate uncle he finds 
an excellent and suitable wife, having before 
that preached so moving and improving a ser-

mon to his errant kinsman on the wickedness 
of his conduct that the sinner gives vent to his 
feeling of remorse in the following somewhat sur- 
prising manner : 

" ' By my soul,' said he, and clapped his two lifted-up 
hands together, ' I hate your father : I never heartily 
loved him; but now I hate him more than ever I did 
in my Ufe.' 

" ' My lord ! ' 

«< < Don't be surprised. I hate him for keeping so long 
abroad a son who would have converted us both. . . . 
O my sister, how have you blessed me in your son. ' " 

A most striking illustration of Sir Charles's 
unfailing graciousness of demeanor even in very 
trying situations is furnished by a letter that he 
wrote to his spendthrift father, just after that 
dissipated gentleman had applied to his son for 
consent to raise money (to pay a gambling debt) 
by mortgaging a part of the family estate. The 
son most magnanimously and respectfully replies: 

" Why, sir, did you condescend to write to me on the 
occasion, as if for my consent ? Why did you not send 
me the deeds ready to sign ? Let me beg of you, ever 
dear and ever honored sir, that you will not suffer any 
difBculties, that I can join to remove, to oppress your 
heart with doubts for one moment. . . . Permit me, sir, 
to add, that, be my income ever so small, I am resolved 
to live within it. And let me beseech you to remit me 
but one half of your present bounty." 

Let it be admitted without dispute that 
Grandison is to us a highly unreal, impossible, 
and even ridiculous character, endowed as he 
is with every virtue, every grace, and every 
worldly advantage, that a fairy godmother could 
have bethought her to bestow upon him at birth, 
and exhibiting his perfections with an elaborate 
mock-modesty through seven closely-printed 
volumes. Nevertheless, if the reader of a less 
naively sentimental age will but take up the 
book in a spirit of indulgence and not let his 
sense of humor get the better of his good- 
humor, he may possibly find himself not wholly 
unbenefitted by a leisurely perusal of the story 
in aU its pitiless length. A month of one's 
spare hours might be passed in far worse com- 
pany than that of the dramatis personce so 
amusingly enumerated at the beginning of the 
work under the headings, " Men," " Women," 
and " Italians." 



An unknown work by Ibsen has recently been dis- 
covered, and will probably be included in an edition of 
his unpublished pieces which is now in preparation. The 
title of the new discovery is " Song at Akershus," Aker- 
shiis being the name of a fortress in Christiania. It 
dates from Ibsen's early years, and is in form a roman- 
tic tale. A plan for transforming Ibsen's house into an 
Ibsen museum has been put forward of late, and is said 
to have met with support. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The rapturous quality in literature is what 
all readers hunger for as they take up each succes- 
sive " book of the year " or phenomenal " best seller," 
but the rapture does not always follow. The older 
and sadder and wiser we grow, the less easily are 
we ravished by current sensational fiction, however 
great and however increasing may be our calm delight 
in our favorite old authors. It is with some interest 
and pleasure, therefore, that we hear from London 
an instance of undoubted ravishment. '' The Blue 
Lagoon," by Mr. A. De Vere Stacpoole — a book 
regarded by Mr. Jacob Tonson as emphatically " the 
book of the season " — was taken up one night by a 
literary woman of good taste and judgment as she 
was combing her hair before going to bed. She began 
to read, and when, an hour and a half later, she came 
to herself and laid the book down, she found herself 
still seated before her dressing table, comb in hand, 
having scarcely moved in all that interval of rapt 
delight. This involuntary tribute the teller of the 
story pronounces to b^ one "which could not perhaps 
be surpassed in all the history of criticism." But it 
is surpassed by at least one other instance. Sir Joshua 
Reynolds was once travelling in the country when, at 
an inn where he chanced to stop for the night, he hit 
upon a copy of Johnson's " Life of Savage," then just 
published ; and he began to read it without so much 
as sitting down, but stood by the fire with the book 
in one hand and his arm resting on the mantelpiece. 
When he at last finished his reading and returned 
to the world about him, he found his arm quite stif- 
fened and benumbed by its long continuance in one 
position. ... 

The conscience op the book-borrower is well 
known to be as easy as an old shoe in the matter of 
returning borrowed books ; and the return of public 
library books — if it were not for the necessity of 
returning them in order to get others, and if it were 
not also for the prick of the two-cents-a-day fine on 
over-due volumes — might well become the exception 
rather than the rule with many a thoughtless user 
of the free library. It is not, however, the ordinary 
little-reflective reader-for-pleasure who alone inclines 
to sin in the thoughtless retention of books over-time ; 
librarians themselves, as Mr. Andrews of the John 
Crerar Library remarked at the library meeting at 
Minnetonka, are not noted for promptness in return- 
ing borrowed books. Conspicuously dilatory, too, 
are the privileged patrons of college and university 
libraries. We have had personal experience of faculty 
members retaining library books for six months, and 
even a year, without so much as a blush of shame 
when requested to consider the rights of others. One 
amusing, and it is to be hoped wholesomely instruc- 
tive, incident comes to mind. One of these un- 
punctual borrowers came to the library in hot quest 
of a much-needed volume, and was thrown into a 
fever of vexation and impatience on being told that

it was out. Nothing would do but that the record 
of the book should be looked up at once and the book 
itself called in as soon as possible under the rules. 
Search was accordingly made, and the volume was 
found charged (under an ancient date) to the appli- 
cant himself. ... 

The lat£ dean of American dramatists, 
Bronson Howard, who has just died in his sixty-sixth 
year, was the prolific author of unusually popular 
and successful plays. Probably his " Shenandoah " 
has been witnessed by more play-goers throughout 
the country than any other drama now on the stage, 
with the exception of " Uncle Tom's Cabin," which 
still travels the backwoods circuit to the unfailing 
delight of rural audiences. That Mr. Howard was 
capable of even better work than he furnished so 
abundantly and acceptably at the call of theatre- 
managers and star-actors, has been thought by more 
than one observer of his rise from inconspicuous 
journalism to international fame as a playwright. 
Other noted plays of his, besides " Shenandoah," 
that readily come to mind are " The Henrietta," 
" Diamonds," " The Banker's Daughter," " Aris- 
tocracy," and (among his later dramas) "Peter 
Stuyvesant," which he wrote in collaboration with 
Professor Brander Matthews, and " Kate," written 
only two years ago. That the American stage 
should, in quick succession, have suffered the loss 
of its most gifted and scholarly actor, Richard 
Mansfield, and of its most experienced and success- 
ful playwright, Bronson Howard, is cause for deep 
regret. . , . 

Old-time literary New England loses another 
link in the chain connecting it with the present, in 
the death of Mrs. Louise Chandler Moulton, at her 
home in Boston, on the 10th of the present month. 
Born in Connecticut in 1835, Mrs. Moulton's literary 
activities began almost with the beginning of the 
half-century and continued until near the time of her 
death. She was a prolific writer of stories and poems 
for the magazines, and of literary criticisms for vari- 
ous publications ; while her published volumes in 
prose and verse number some twenty titles. Her 
work as editor was also notable, including a collec- 
tion of the poems of Philip Bourke Marston, to which 
she prefixed a touching and appreciative memoir; 
and she rendered a similar service for Arthur 
O'Shaughnessy, the Irish poet. Mrs. Moulton's own 
poems are marked by sincerity and artistic skill, and 
in all she did she showed herself a cultivated and 
conscientious literary worker. Few indeed are now 
left of the group of New England writers to which 
Mrs. Moulton belonged. 

... 

The public library and the children are, 
between them, producing a lively centre of literary 
activity at Cleveland, Ohio, where, under the com- 
petent direction of Librarian Brett, the intellectual 
needs of young readers are being administered to in 



a variety of novel and effective ways. An attractive, 
instructive, well-illustrated, and thoroughly interest- 
ing pamphlet or " hand-book " was prepared by the 
Library Board, primarily for the information of the 
attendants at the late annual convention of the Na- 
tional Educational Association in Cleveland, and also 
for the citizens interested in the library work going 
on among their children ; and this hand-book, entitled 
"The Work of the Cleveland Public Library with 
the Children," is now, through Librarian Brett's kind- 
ness, offered to such of our subscribers as choose to 
ask for it. " The work as outlined in this hand- 
book," vtrrites Mr. Brett in a personal letter, "repre- 
sents various phases of its development here, but in 
many instances it is not peculiar to our library." 
Enough, however, is peculiar and original to make 
the pamphlet a notable contribution to the literature 
of public library administration. The chapter on 
"Home Libraries," of which there were thirty-two 
in operation last year, reveals some especially novel 
features. ... 

The death of Katharine Prescott Wormeley 
occurred at her summer home in Jackson, N. H., 
August 4, at the age of seventy-eight. Miss Worme- 
ley was much more than the translator of the standard 
English version of Balzac and the first to popularize 
the great French novelist in America. Finer and 
nobler than her work as translator and biographer 
was her service in the cause of charity and of girls* 
education. Though she was born in England, she 
warmly espoused the cause of her adopted country 
during our Civil War, and was a leader in the work 
of the United States Sanitary Commission. A his- 
tory of that Commission and its work, and a later 
book called "The Other Side of War," are relics of 
this period of her life. The Girls' Industrial School 
at Newport, founded by her and maintained at her 
own risk for three years, after which it was incorpo- 
rated with the city's public school system, is another 
monument to her philanthropic zeal. Perhaps Miss 
Wormeley's distinguishing characteristic was sym- 
pathy and appreciation : the ability to enter heartily 
into the spirit actuating other workers helped to make 
her the sympathetic and faithful translator she so 
abundantly proved herself to be. She had the true 
artist's delight in her work, and her very recent maga- 
zine paper giving her reminiscences of the second 
funeral of Napoleon shows her to have been far more 
than a hack writer or literary drudge. 
... 

The adventures of Pedro Serrano, a Spanish 
castaway who may have given Defoe the idea for 
his " Robinson Crusoe," might perhaps with some 
profit be brought out, by an enterprising modern pub- 
lisher, in a form suitable for young people's reading. 
Garcilaso de la Vega's " Comentarios Reales " give 
the story on the authority of a person who knew 
Serrano and had often heard him relate his strange 
experiences. The island on which he was wrecked 
was but a patch of sandy reef in the Caribbean Sea, 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



79 



and the seven years' sufferings of Serrano give by 
comparison an air of ease and luxury to Robinson 
Crusoe's life on his wooded and fertile Juan Fer- 
nandez. This Caribbean episode dates back prob- 
ably to the early sixteenth century. An English 
translation of the " Comentarios " appeared in 1688 ; 
and as Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe" was not pub- 
lished till 1719, he may well have read Garcilaso's 
narrative before writing his own. These facts about 
Serrano and his extraordinary history, as told by 
Mr. John D. Leckie in " Chambers's Journal," sug- 
gest the possibility that Serrano rather than Selkirk 
may have served as Defoe's model in framing his 
immortal story. Or was it more probably a combi- 
nation of the two ? , , . 

The new editor of "Uncle Remus's Mag- 
azine " is, appropriately enough, the late Joel 
Chandler Harris's son, Mr. Julian Harris, who had 
been associated with his father in literary work, 
had secured the necessary financial backing for the 
magazine, had acted as its assistant editor, and had 
taken an active part in its business management. 
He is reputed an able writer, and indeed has col- 
laborated with his father in two books not yet pub- 
lished. From an announcement that appears in 
the August number of the magazine we learn that 
the late editor desired no monument, but chose to be 
remembered by a brief line informing the readers 
of his periodical that it was "founded by Joel 
Chandler Harris." To his son and successor his 
impressive injunction was : " Keep the magazine 
clean, wholesome, and fresh with the best and 
simplest in life. Never let it become just a money- 
making machine." The promised continuance of 
the publication in the spirit of its founder is subject 
for congratulation. 

The rudimentary quality of illustration 
IN color, as at present produced, with such pride 
of achievement, in some of our leading monthly 
magazines, must have impressed itself on many 
readers of those magazines. Undoubtedly the time 
will come when the colored picture of our day will 
look as laughably crude and childish as does now 
to us the old woodcut of our grandparents' spelling- 
book. A writer on book-illustration in the July 
" Book Monthly " informs his readers that "the first 
English printed book to be illustrated was Caxton's 
' Myrrour of the Worlde,' printed in 1481. The 
blocks were quite elementary in character, thus 
resembling indeed all the woodcuts of English books 
for a long time." And he adds, " Is it not a far cry 
from those days to the present colour-book done in 
the three-colour process ? " By no means ; there is, 
instead, a certain sort of similarity of crudeness in 
the two. , , , 

The NEWEST Shakespeare gospel is preached 
by Dr. Peter Alvor, who, in a book just published 
at Hanover and entitled " Das Neue Shakespeare- 
Evangelium," endeavors to persuade the world that 



all the so-called Shakespeare tragedies were written 
by the Earl of Southampton, and all the comedies 
by the Earl of Rutland ; but that, in order to escape 
political persecution, these noble authors induced a 
second-rate actor, William Shakespeare by name, to 
assume responsibility for the plays, and paid him 
well for this use of his name. Rutland's claims to 
the authorship not only of the comedies, but of all 
the plays, have already been defended by another 
German Shakespeare scholar, Professor Karl Bleib- 
treu, who ridicules this notion of a divided author- 
ship. " All for Rutland " is his motto ; nothing for 
Southampton, nothing for Shakespeare, nothing for 
Bacon even, does he allow.

A NONAGENARIAN OPTIMIST, Professor William 
Matthews, author of " Getting on in the World " 
(which is said to have sold to the extent of 70,000 
copies in this country and to have been translated 
into Norwegian, Swedish, and Hungarian), had his 
recent birthday brightened by the visits of admiring 
friends. At present he is confined as a patient in 
the Emerson Hospital in Boston, having met with 
an accident that makes him temporarily unable to 
walk. The life of this somewhat copious author of 
books helpful to young men and not hurtful even to 
older persons is a fine comment on the products of 
his pen. The veteran author is still writing, even 
in bed, and hopes soon to leave the hospital and 
prosecute his literary work with renewed vigor.

Agreement on a Shakespeare memorial of 
some kind will doubtless result from the action taken 
by the recent joint meeting of the Shakespeare Me- 
morial Committee and the National Theatre Shake- 
speare Memorial Committee at London. The meet- 
ing was held at the Mansion House, there was a large 
attendance, and the Lord Mayor presided. As most 
of those who have been prominent in urging that the 
memorial take the form of a theatre rather than a 
huge statue in Portland Place are named as members 
of the new joint executive committee, there is good 
ground to hope that the much-discussed National 
Theatre will one day rise in memory of the world's 
greatest dramatist. , , , 

Literature in the laundry, even in the 
Chinese laundry, is not necessarily smothered and 
suffocated by the steam from the washtub. In a 
street-car in the suburbs of Boston — Boston, of 
course — there was recently to be seen the rather 
unusual spectacle of a Chinese laundryman intently 
reading a book ; and, what is more, the book was 
discovered to be Dr. Lambourne's work on "The 
Fundamental Fact in Mythology." Does not such an 
incident make the Yellow Peril seem considerably 
less imminent ? If the Celestial Kingdom is to fur- 
nish us scholars and philosophers to keep our linen 
white, it were ingratitude and folly to clamor for 
exclusion laws.

Norway to Alaska in a 
Herring Boat.* 



To write well, one must first have something 
to say. Captain Roald Amundsen, commander 
of the first successful Northwest-Passage expe- 
dition, has something of prime importance to 
relate, and his straightforward narrative makes 
not only one of the best books of Arctic explo- 
ration but one of the best books of adventure 
of any sort that have ever been written. Of 
course the existence of a continuous passage 
through the northern seas, from the Atlantic to 
the Pacific, had been well enough known for 
half a century or more, thanks to the devoted 
labors of Parry, Franklin, CoUinson, Rae, and 
other British explorers ; but no vessel had as 
yet succeeded in threading the difficult and dan- 
gerous route continuously from ocean to ocean. 
Captain Amundsen's undertaking to accomplish 
this in a little herring boat of forty-seven tons 
was by many regarded as foolhardy, but it was 
plain that no vessel of deep draught or great 
breadth of beam could hope to navigate the 
shallows and pick its way through the floating 
ice of those far-northern waters. 

Roald Amundsen, according to his much too 
brief account of his early youth and his boyhood 
ambitions, was a born explorer and Arctic voy- 
ager. Nothing could still within his breast the 
caU of the North-Polar seas, and he early began 
to fit himself for what he felt to be his life work. 
Seal-hunting in the far north was followed by 
an Antarctic voyage in the capacity of mate to 
the Belgian Antarctic Expedition xmder Adrien 
de Gerlaehe, 1897-1899. " It was during this 
voyage," says the author, " that my plan ma- 
tured : I proposed to combine the dream of my 
boyhood as to North West Passage with an aim, 
in itself of far greater scientific importance, 
that of locating the 2yresent situation of the

country, and thence to Hamburg to submit his

as to furnish his visitor with instruction at the 
Observatory in the details of magnetic obser- 
vations and the use of magnetic instruments. 
Advice and encouragement were also sought 
from the greatest living Scandinavian explorer, 
Dr. Fridtjof Nansen ; then foUowed some years 
of wearisome endeavor to raise funds for the 
proposed expedition, an endeavor too persistent 
to fail ; and at last, in the early summer of 
1903, ship, crew, and cargo were all in readiness, 
and the adventurous party of seven sailed from 
Christiania. 

The long voyage lasted, if we may credit the 
title-page of " The Northwest Passage," from 
1903 to 1907; but Cape Nome, which was 
practically the end of the all-important " pas- 
sage," was reached in the late summer of 1906, 
nor does the narrative pursue further the for- 
tunes of either ship or crew, though one may 
infer that the " Gjoa's " voyage was continued at 
least to San Francisco. What thereafter became 
of the sturdy craft the reader would much like 
to know — a curiosity that is not in the smallest 
degree gratified by the author. 

Captain Amundsen does well not to preface 
his narrative with an exhaustive history of 
Northwest-Passage exploration before his time. 
The books are numerous enough on this subject, 
and we are just now eagerly interested in the 
" Gjoa " and the seven young Norwegians who 
man her, and who convey the impression of being 
rather a party of rollicking schoolboys escaped 
from their books than a serious band of dis- 
coverers, carrying their lives in their hands and 
intent on great ends. Such preliminary and 
interspersed accoimt as is given of what had 
already been effected by Franklin and others in 
their search for the long-desired passage is too 
brief and hasty to be altogether trustworthy. 
That, however, need not destroy one's confidence 
in the author's record of his own and his com- 
panions' achievements. What they did and saw 
and suffered is set down with the simplicity, 
restraint, and directness characteristic of the 
true hero's account of his deeds. Difficult navi- 
gation, sledge excursions that were not exactly 
summer picnics, meteorological and magnetic 
observations under trying conditions, the exac- 
tion of some degree of respect and decorum from 
the swarming Esquimaux that beset them in 
their winter quarters, and the continual problem 
of food, fuel, and shelter in the cruel cold of 
those latitudes — that, in brief, indicates the work 
that was cut out for Captain Amundsen and his 
little crew. No doctor accompanied the expedi- 
tion, and, although the commander essayed the

part of physician when occasion demanded, one 
life was lost before the voyage was completed ; 
and one life out of seven was more than a deci- 
mation of the entire force. Two men, however, — 
one a Norwegian, the other an American — were 
found to repair as far as possible the sad loss. 

Among many perils more or less exciting, 
even in the author's quiet narration, one 
especially deserves mention. The vessel had 
grounded in the shallows of Franklin Strait, 
the north wind blew a gale accompanied by sleet, 
and the spray was dashing over deck and rigging. 
After consulting with his comrades the captain 
decided to try to get the ship off with the sails. 
With much exertion they were set. The nar- 
rator continues : 

" Then we commenced a method of sailing not one of 
us is ever likely to forget even should he attain the age 
of Methuseleh. The mighty press of sail and the high 
choppy sea, combined, had the effect of lifting the ves- 
sel up and pitching her forward again among the rocks, so 
that we expected every moment to see her planks scat- 
tered on the sea. The false keel was splintered and 
floated up. All we could do was to watch the course of 
events and calmly await the issue. As a matter of fact, 
I cannot say I did feel calm as I stood in the rigging 
and followed the dance from one rock to another. I 
stood there with the bitterest self-reproach. If I had 
set a watch in the crow's nest, this would never have 
happened, because he would have observed the reef a 
long way off and reported it. Was my carelessness to 
wreck our whole undertaking, which had begun so auspi- 
ciously ? Should we, who had got so much further than 
anyone before us — we who had so fortunately cleared 
parts of the passage universally regarded as the most 
difficult — should we now be compelled to stop and turn 
back crestfallen ? " 

By throwing overboard the deck cargo and thus 
enabling the ship to rise a little higher under 
wind and wave, she finally and with many ter- 
rific bumps got off the reef and into compara- 
tively navigable waters. 

Another and an earlier narrow escape from 
destruction is worth noting, A furious fire one 
day broke out in the engine-room, right among 
the tanks holding two thousand gallons of petro- 
leum, and was only extinguished after the most 
daring and energetic exertions from all hands. 
The Fates on the whole were kind to these bold 
adventurers, but few readers will be tempted to 
try a yachting cruise along the northern coast 
of our continent, rich in incident though such a 
voyage might be. 

The pages devoted to the Esquimaux and 
their ways are fresh and interesting. Unversed 
in the native dialects, these Norwegians yet con- 
trived to talk, with some degree of volubility, 
with the round-faced men of the icy North ; and 
the intimate studies made of a few more strik- 



ing or more intelligent individuals among them 
are, in a human way, worth all the geographical 
and scientific information in the entire two vol- 
umes. Here is a picture of Talurnaktu, a 
Nechilli Esquimau, who was taken into the 
camp on King William Land : 

" His toilet was grand. Next to his skin he wore a 
blue woollen guernsey, over this a himting shirt, and 
outside an under-coat (anorak). His imderstandings 
were clothed in a pair of moleskin trousers. All these 
were worn-out old clothes discarded by Lindstrom. ' I 
shall darn them during the winter,' he said; but mean- 
time he left the rags as they were. On his head he had 
an old cycling cap, to which he had attached a dirty 
collar by way of ornament. Take him all round he was 
really a regular * 'Arry,' and always cheerful. He 
smoked and chewed tobacco, and he did all he could to 
conduct himself like a white man. He took great pride 
in about six hairs, half an inch long, growing on his 
upper lip. He spoke with the utmost scorn of men who 
had no moustache. He was as strong as a bear, and, as he 
was so willing, he was a splendid fellow to have as help." 

Sad but not surprising is the white man's 
influence on these natives of the hyperborean 
ice-fields as noted by the author. 

" During the voyage of the ' Gjoa ' we came into con- 
tact with ten different Eskimo tribes in all, and we had 
good opportunities of observing the influence of civihsa- 
tion on them, as we were able to compare those Eskimo 
who had come into contact with civilisation with those 
who had not. And I must state it as my firm convic- 
tion that the latter, the Eskimo living absolutely isolated 
from civilisation of any kind, are undoubtedly the hap- 
piest, healthiest, most honorable and most contented 
among them. It must, therefore, be the bounden duty 
of civilised nations who come into contact with the 
Eskimo, to safeguard them against contaminating influ- 
ences, and by laws and stringent regulations protect 
them against the many perils and evils of so-called civ- 
ilisation." 

A supplementary chapter narrates inter- 
estingly the events of Lieutenant Hansen's 
surveying expedition to the east coast of Vic- 
toria Land, which he christened " King Haakon 
VII. Coast." This account is from the lieu- 
tenant's pen. The scientific observations con- 
ducted by Captain Amundsen and his assistants, 
with various instriunents brought for the pur- 
pose, must be counted the most valuable fruits 
of the voyage ; but, although the subject is not 
entered upon in detail, it appears that several 
years must elapse before the necessary calcula- 
tions are completed to render these observations 
of actual service to mankind. The determina- 
tion of the magnetic north pole is no holiday 
pastime. As to the Northwest Passage itself, 
it is obviously of no commercial or other use 
now that it is found ; and in fact the only really 
fresh achievement to be credited to the " Gjoa " 
is the accomplishment of the hitherto short 
unnavigated section of the passage in the neigh-

borhood of Cape Colborne. Nevertheless, the 
very fact that there was no business profit in 
this arduous undertaking makes us admire the 
high-spirited explorers who risked their lives 
and endured a three-years' banishment from the 
civilized world for the sake of an idea. 

The narrative is not free from bewildering 
inconsistencies, which sometimes amount to 
positive inaccuracies. For instance, an early 
chapter has one passage that makes the " Gjoa " 
sail through Bellot Strait, between North Som- 
erset and Boothia Felix, while the context, as 
well as the indicated route on the map, shows 
plainly that the vessel passed through Barrow 
Strait, north of North Somerset, and down 
through Franklin Strait to King William Land. 
The illustrations are abundant and, being chiefly 
from photographs, trustworthy and helpful. The 
maps are also useful, but are not drawn on a 
scale large enough to display every movement 
of vessel and sledge. The English translator's 
name is withheld, though he has no reason to 
be ashamed of his work, so far as one can see. 
It is worth noting as a sign of the book's appar- 
ent popularity that there are published simul- 
taneously versions in Swedish, Finnish, Russian, 
German, and Italian, besides the original Nor- 
wegian edition. Percy F. Bicknell. 



Old Essays and a :n^ew Play by 
"Vernon Leb."* 

The talented woman whose name in real life 
is Violet Paget, although she writes over the 
more prosaic and non-committal signature of 
"Vernon Lee," has given us a new edition of 
" Limbo, aud Other Essays," with the addition 
of a drama entitled " Ariadne in Mantua." The 
author's first book appeared when she was only 
twenty-four years old, a rather youthful age to 
publish such a work as " Studies in the Eight- 
eenth Century in Italy." During the three sub- 
sequent decades she has been writing attractive 
essays, stories, dialogues, and so forth, and has 
gradually won well-deserved recognition. She 
is master of an easy, at times almost conversa- 
tional style, that makes the reader feel he is 
being treated en intime ; and it is naturally 
delightful to enter into such relations with an 
unusually clever woman. But " Vernon Lee " is 
decidedly more than clever — she is clairvoyant 
and sympathetic. Her eyes have looked into 
life and have bidden her judgment be merciful. 

• Limbo, and Other Essays. With a new drama, " Ariadne 
in Mantua." By Vernon Lee. New York : John Lane Co. 



In literature her studies have been comprehen- 
sive and thorough, although the results thereof 
are never obtruded pedantically. While an 
intimate topographical knowledge of most of 
Western Europe is implied by her writings, her 
years have been spent largely in Italy, which 
she knows as few descendants of the Goths 
and Vandals have ever known the winsome land 
beyond the Alps. For her, Italy is the nearest 
point of approach to the land east of the sun 
and west of the moon ; and with this feeling the 
reviewer assuredly cannot quarrel as he faces a 
flood of memories. Perhaps, too, there is a lit- 
tle of the personal equation in the feeling that 
our author is most attractive when dealing with 
Italian themes ; but there can be no doubt that, 
in general, her most successful essays are of the 
" travel-and-place " type. In the present vol- 
ume, for instance, " Ravenna and her Ghosts " 
is incomparably better than the eponymous 
chapter. Indeed, " Limbo " is so far from de- 
serving the place of honor that it is decidedly 
the least attractive section of the book. On the 
whole it may be said that " Vernon Lee " can 
hardly appeal to readers who have not had a 
little of her good fortune in the way of leisure 
and travel, or have not at least caught sight of 
the spirit of leisure in the flux of things and 
learned to send the spirit journeying whither 
the body cannot fare. Within this circle, how- 
ever, she will be keenly enjoyed. 

" Ariadne in Mantua " seems to us an ex- 
ceptionally charming closet drama. The action 
takes place in the palace of Mantua during 
the reign of Prospero I. of Milan. The young 
duke is under the spell of a benumbing melan- 
cholia. One Diego, a famous singer, has been 
summoned from Venice to gain access to his 
Highness's confidence and to aid in relieving 
the strange obsession. It soon transpires that 
Diego is the courtesan Magdalen, who had been 
the Duke's genuinely beloved mistress when he 
was serving abroad. The invalid is restored to 
health without discovering the identity of his 
lost love and the healing singer. In the last 
act he marries his cousin ; and at the festival 
Diego presents a masque treating of Ariadne's 
desertion by Theseus and her refusal to be com- 
forted by Bacchus. The ending must be left 
for those of our readers who care to peruse the 
play. Throughout the drama the characters 
are well limned. But perhaps the most remark- 
able is the Duchess Dowager ; for here a woman 
writer has convincingly depicted a virtuous 
woman of noble birth as being infinitely mer- 
ciful and tender to an erring sister who sprang

from the gutter. The language is consistent 
with the respective personce, and worthy of the 
theme, occasionally rising to a lofty level. The 
parallel between the myth and the events in the 
play is never allowed to become too prominent ; 
nor do the players ever lose their human interest 
from being representatives of a problem. The 
playwright frankly avows her feeling that " these 
personages had an importance greater than that 
of their life and adventures, a meaning, if I may 
say so, a little sub specie ceternitatis. For 
besides the real figures, there appeared to me 
vague shadows cast by them, as it were, on the 
vast spaces of life, and magnified far beyond 
those little puppets that I twitched." This 
modestly voiced hope seems to us thoroughly 
justified, and we are glad to recommend the 
play to any reader who is willing to ponder a 
little on the relation between " mere impulse, 
unreasoning and violent, but absolutely true to 
its aim," and " the moderating, the weighing, and 
restraining influences of civilization." Tradi- 
tion, Discipline, Discretion, — in the presence 
of these necessary and victorious factors of 
progress what shall become of untutored love 
and the eternal cry of the human heart ?

The IjIberatob Saint of Itai-y.* 



The story of the great Mystics makes an 
interesting and remarkable chapter in the prog- 
ress and development of mankind. Side by side 
with the religions and philosophies that have 
been the profound and influential teachers of the 
race has moved the procession of specially illu- 
mined men and women who have emphasized 
the deepening message of the ages from a stand- 
point and comprehension more or less individual, 
and furnishing a witness of the unfolding truth 
cogent and alluring. The Mystics have labored 
diligently within the field of the established 
faiths, but often with distinct antagonisms to 
popular ruling doctrines and institutions. In- 
deed, they have usually occupied the place of 
reformers and liberators ; they have made vehe- 
ment attacks upon privilege and prerogative, 
the sources of manifold and tyrannizing evils ; 
they have been voices in the wilderness, crying 
out against manifest and powerful wrong ; they 
have brought healing and regeneration from 
direct contact with essential life and thought. 

* Saint Catherine op Siena. A Study in the Religion, 
Literature, and History of the Fourteenth Century in Italy. By 
Edmund G. Gardner, M.A. New York : E. P. Dutton & Co. 



The Mystics have appeared in all nations and 
times. The mind of Japan was singularly sus- 
ceptible to the revelations which make the sub- 
stance of the Mystic's report and narrative ; 
even in prosaic and moralistic China there were 
reactions against the prevalent Confucianism 
that lifted the veil from before the sanctuary ; 
in India the Gita-Govitida rivals the Song of 
Songs in its impassioned disclosures of relations 
that are to be found discussed at length in Mystic 
literature everywhere ; and the Bhagavat- Gita 
presents a dialogue which has found its echoes 
again and again in books. Persia was a luxu- 
riant soil for the growth of poems that indicate 
and illustrate experiences not belonging to the 
ordinary light of the common day ; even the 
skeptical Omar has in some interpretations been 
made the bearer of a transcendent intelligence. 
The Song of Solomon aroused the middle-age 
thinkers to a long line of kindred and supra- 
mundane revelations. Plato, Philo, Plotinus 
deal with realms to which the thought of man 
is not unaccustomed, but which require an un- 
wearied wing and an unusual exercise of energy. 
The Mystic, however, found a most congenial 
home and a responsive audience during the 
Middle Ages. The ardent subjectivity of man- 
kind awoke to a wonderful consciousness of it- 
self, and began to discover regions hardly known 
before. Bonaventura, Bernard of Clairvaux, 
Nicholas of Cusa, Saint Catherine of Siena, — 
these belong to a cloud of witnesses who have an 
extraordinary message to deliver, and who pre- 
sent it with singular nobility and marked unan- 
imity. The Mystic tradition has come down to 
modern times in France, in England, in America; 
the transcendentalist has had his tale to tell, and 
has told it with inspiration and charm. 

It may be an easy exercise of the skeptical 
understanding to sweep all this long and con- 
tinuous history into the limbo of the abnormal 
and the hysterical ; it may certainly be said 
that there are sane and reasoned philosophies 
whose content differs in no wise from that of the 
genuine mystical literatures. With the com- 
plete discrediting of the mystical, we shall also 
be obliged to discredit these. It may be that 
Plato and Hegel and Emerson have dwelt in a 
vague and hazy dreamland, and that modern 
culture and life can have in them, after all, only 
an historical interest; but with the disappear- 
ance of these from a real part in the experiences 
of to-day, shall we also get rid of Dante and 
Goethe and sundry other poets and men of 
letters ? The question can only be raised here, 
without any attempt at discussion.

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



Catherine of Siena, mystic as she was, had 
her doubts ; but she found a way of meeting 
them. We quote from her : 

" I will teach thee [said the Voice in her heart] how 
to distinguish My visions from the visions of the enemy. 
My vision begins with terror, but always, as it grows, 
gives greater confidence ; it begins with some bitterness, 
but always groweth more sweet. In the vision of the 
enemy, the contrary happens; for in the beginning it 
seems to bring some gladness, confidence, or sweetness, 
but, as it proceeds, fear and bitterness grow continuously 
in the soul of whoso beholds it. . . . But I will give 
thee another sign more infallible and more certain. Be 
assured that, since I am Truth, there ever results from 
My visions a greater knowledge of truth in the soul ; 
and, because the knowledge of truth is most necessary 
to her about Me and about herself, that is, that she 
should know Me and know herself, from which knowl- 
edge it ever follows that she despises herself and honors 
Me, which is the proper office of himaility, it is inevi- 
table that from My visions the soul becomes more 
humble, knowing herself, and knowing Me better." 

This is, of course, the medisBval method of 
stating the fact ; but even at the present time 
the easy and pleasurable way of the physiological 
analysis, with its complicated experimental sta- 
tions, is not an imquestionable one of reaching 
the truth. Moreover, the speculative results of 
the visionaries have often found fruitful demon- 
strations in the realms of history and reality. 

The Mystics have been of all grades and 
varieties — illiterate and cultured, peasant and 
nobleman, pauper and prince ; they have occu- 
pied every station in life and performed every 
sort of labor ; they have ploughed the seas and 
discovered new continents like Columbus ; they 
have disposed of refractory Parliaments like 
Cromwell ; they have crowned monarchs against 
seemingly overwhelming odds like Jeanne d' Arc ; 
they have transformed a whole world like Martin 
Luther. They have bled on the field of battle, 
they have been burned in the fires of martjrr- 
dom, they have died on the cross, for the Truth's 
sake. They can, however, be properly divided 
into three classes — the Quietists, whose lives 
are given to contemplation ; the Voluntarists, 
who rush into the mad whirl of the world and 
pluck victory from the jaws of the impossible : 
and the Intellectualists, who give an account of 
themselves and develop a psychology of the 
Mystic consciousness. It seems likely that they 
will continue to appear in the future as they 
have done in the past. 

The subject of the exhaustive and captivating 
study immediately before us, Saint Catherine 
of Siena, was the comparatively uneducated 
daughter of Jacomo and Lapa di Benincasa, 
simple and earnest people who did all in their 
power for the large family with which they were 



blessed. She was born on the 25th of March, 
1347, the feast of the Annunciation, which 
according to Sienese reckoning was the first day 
of the new year. Saint Francis of Assisi had 
died a hundred and twenty years before, and 
Dante had passed from exile a quarter of a cen- 
tury earlier. Petrarch was then forty-three 
years old ; Boccaccio had not yet written the De- 
cameron ; Chaucer was probably a boy of seven ; 
Charles King of Bohemia had been elected 
Emperor ; and Pope Clement VI. ruled at 
Avignon. Italy was still the " hostelry of 
sorrow " and not yet the " lady of provinces." 
The cities were in the hands of remorseless 
tyrants, or, if they pretended to govern them- 
selves, were subject to internal conflicts and 
hostile attacks from their neighbors. Hordes 
of mercenary soldiers held allegiance now under 
this one and now under that, and gave misrule 
additional horrors. The moral condition of 
ruler and citizen was no better than the politi- 
cal ; pestilence and disease came with resistless 
strength and malignity. 

Catherine of Siena was to pass into this scene 
and this atmosphere with words of admonition 
and hands of healing. Her power was shown 
early ; visions floated before her, and her voca- 
tion was soon determined. She met with the 
usual opposition from home and friends, but she 
went forth undeterred to the fulfilment of her 
work. She joined the Sisters of Penance of 
St. Dominic, called in Siena the Mantellate, — 
not nuns, strictly speaking, but devoted to the 
service of religion while remaining in their 
homes. Her life became painfuUy rigid and 
austere ; her soid was evidently set apart for 
special labors and duties. 

Gradually a body of faithful disciples and 
adherents gathered about her, members of the 
Mantellate, women of culture and noble birth ; 
then priests, who recognized her right of leader- 
ship, and later men and women from every 
walk in life. Chief among her followers were 
the Fra Raimondo du Capua, later Master of 
the Dominicans, who wrote her story, the 
authentic source of information about her, and 
Stefano Maconi, the Carthusian, a man of the 
same mould as herself. The fellowship found 
ample toil waiting for it. Catherine was a leader 
and commander, — 

" A wonderfully endowed woman with an intuition so 
swift and infallible that men deemed it miraculous, the 
magic of a personality so winning and irresistible that 
neither man nor woman could hold out against it, a 
simple untaught wisdom that confounded the arts and 
subtleties of the world; and with these a speech so 
golden, so full of mystical eloquence, that her words. 



1908.] 



THE DIAL.

whether written or spoken, made all hearts burn within 
them when her message came. In ecstatic contempla- 
tion she passes into regions beyond sense and above 
reason, voyaging alone in tmexplored and untrodden 
realms of the spirit; but when the sounds of the earth 
break in upon her trance, a homely common sense and 
simple humor are hers, no less than the knowledge 
acquired in these communings with an unseen world." 

Catherine soon entered upon her great tasks. 
The fellowship at different times occupied differ- 
ent abodes ; they grew into a significant power 
in Siena. Catherine was a preacher of win- 
ning charm and singular allurement ; she per- 
suaded many into an abandonment of lives that 
brought forth unwholesome fruits. Siena was 
torn by feuds and hostile factions, and Catherine 
was recognized as a mediator in their internecine 
quarrels. Nor was Siena alone aware that a new 
spiritual force had arisen in Italy. She was to 
play a part in the settlement of political dis- 
turbances in Milan and Pisa and Lucca and 
Florence. She now began the series of letters 
which continued during the remainder of her 
days. They contain her hopes and dreams, 
they exhort priests and potentates to bring 
about that reformation of Church and State 
which will give peace and unity to Italy ; they 
voice again the aspirations which make up the 
political creed of her predecessor Dante, and 
which burst forth with renewed vigor in the im- 
passioned demands of her successor Savonarola. 
Into the details of this struggle, and this 
mingled defeat and victory, we cannot enter 
here. She threw herself with unrestrained ardor 
into three large projects — a mistaken zeal for 
another crusade, urged by the Pope ; the reforma- 
tion and regeneration of the prelacy ; the return 
of the Pope to Rome from his exile in Avignon. 
This last had already been fiercely brought to 
the attention of Gregory XI., by the Swedish 
Mystic and Prophetess, Birgitta, then residing 
in Rome. " Unless the Pope," was the message of 
Birgitta, " comes to Italy in the time and in the 
year appointed, the lands of the Church, which 
are now united under his sway and obedience, 
will be flivided in the hands of his enemies." 

The difficulties of the time had brought on 
the bitter war between Florence and the Pope ; 
the cities vacillated between the two ; Bernabo 
Visconti, the sinister tyrant of Milan, gave 
gloomy counsel and fomented discord ; Giovanna, 
the pleasure-loving and mysterious Queen of 
Naples, intervened and increased the bitterness 
of the conflict ; Catherine with her fellowship 
was called to Florence, and from there sent to 
Avignon. This was the crowning labor of her 
life. The Florentines behaved with wily and 



astute treachery ; the counsellors about the Pope 
built up every sort of obstacle, palpable and 
tenuous, between her and the Holy Father ; she 
maintained her spiritual supremacy, held him 
firm to the purpose, and after incredible tribula- 
tions, natural and apparently supernatural, re- 
stored the Pope to the Imperial city. 

Her great work was done. In the year 
following, and at the coming of the schism, 
when several Popes claimed the legitimacy of 
their election, Catherine espoused the cause of 
Urban VI. She came to Rome at his invitation, 
and there, after enduring prolonged and violent 
suffering, induced perhaps by the austerity of her 
life, she made the great transition, surrounded by 
her unfaltering friends, on April 29, 1380. 

Toward the close of her life, Catherine took 
thought for the written word she was leaving 
behind her. In the early autumn of 1378 she 
completed her remarkable book, the Dialogo 
or Libro della Divina Dottrina. The volume 
is a series of Dialogues, in which the mystical 
doctrines of the Saint are unfolded at length, 
and in which the views presented in Catherine's 
letters are more fuUy expounded. The letters 
number nearly four hundred. These are writ- 
ten to kings and mendicants, saints and sinners, 
priests and popes. They are done with authority 
as of one who had the right to speak and give 
counsel and admonition. When the names of 
the patriotic lovers of Italy are spoken, no one 
should forget the name of Catherine of Siena. 

For the work of Mr. Edmund G. Gardner, 
exhaustive and scholarly, one can only have 
that admiration which mastery of a subject in- 
evitably invites and receives. Mr. Gardner 
knows Italy, its life, its history, its religion, its 
ideals, as few men know any country, even their 
own. It is superfluous to say that the original 
sources of information have been at the author's 
command, and the libraries of Italy have been 
laid under contribution. The subject is treated 
at length, and with perhaps extreme detail ; but 
the picture of the fourteenth century in Italy is 
significant and convincing. The author is in 
f iill sympathy with the noble woman who makes 
the centre of his portrayal, and not blind to the 
difficulties which surround so arcane a subject. 
There is sometimes to be found the scholar's 
besetting sin, a too impressive display of erudi- 
tion, and a too close adherence to authorities, 
with a consequent lack of finish ; but happily, 
since Pater wrote, the critic's office has been 
merged in that of the interpreter's. The work 
is a superb one, worthy of the fine setting which 
the publishers have given it, — in illustrations

The orderly arrangement of the work is

and the picture becomes more effective with

" Symphony," the exhaustive biographies of 
Schumann and Schubert, and sketches of promi- 
nent musicians and composers such as Rossini, 
Rubinstem, Spontini, Spohr, Smetana, Strauss 
(Richard), Saint-Saens, Svendsen, Sullivan, and 
such technical articles as " Scale " and "Singing," 
have presented themselves for consideration, it 
is difficult to see how the aggregate of matter 
from these letters could have been treated in 
any less space. " Sonata," " Suite," and " Sym- 
phony " remain substantially as they appear in 
the first issue of the Dictionary. " Song," how- 
ever, has been greatly extended (now occupying 
eighty-one pages), as well as enriched and sup- 
plied with numerous illustrations by the scholarly 
research and skilled knowledge of Mrs. Edmond 
Wodehouse. 

The biographical sketches are not always 
satisfactory. Some of the old ones, whose sub- 
jects are becoming antiquated, might well have 
been shortened to make room for more extended 
sketches of contemporary composers. This 
exception, however, cannot be taken to the 
sketch of Richard Strauss, prepared by Mr. Mait- 
land, the editor of the Dictionary. It is not a 
sentence too long, considering its merit, and if 
it had been shortened we might have missed the 
well-deserved strictures of Mr. Maitland upon 
this newly-risen genius who seeks to surprise " by 
independence and impertinence." Those who 
are not blown about by every " new wind of

doctrine " that spreads abroad from Germany 
will agree with Mr. Maitland's conclusion : 

" It is of course too soon to guess what Strauss's posi- 
tion among the musicians of the world may ultimately 
be ; while he is still young enough to admit that his 
main object is to shock and startle, he is not too old to 
change his convictions." 

Let us hope he will do so, and eventually pro- 
duce some work which does not require an eluci- 
datory progi-amme to render it intelligible. 

The article on " Symphony Concerts " is 
interesting from its local point of view, as it con- 
tains the history of eight American symphony 
orchestras, viz., the Boston Symphony, Brooklyn 
Philharmonic, Theodore Thomas Orchestra, Cin- 
cinnati Symphony (recently disbanded). Phil- 
harmonic Society of New York, New York 
Symphony, and the Philadelphia and Pittsburg 
orchestras. The historical facts in the life of 
our own Chicago orchestra are correctly given 
except in one regard. The writer, a New York 
musical critic, says that at the end of the first 
period of the contract the guarantors were dis- 
couraged by the losses entailed by the concerts 
and by " certain unpleasant experiences in which 
Mr. Thomas had become involved as Musical 
Director of the World's Fair in 1893." It 
woidd have been historically correct to say that 
they were " disappointed," not " discouraged," 
by the losses, and that Mr. Thomas's World's 
Fair experiences had no more to do with the 
orchestra's affairs or the guarantors' feelings 
than the rising of the sun. But New York will 
never be exactly just to Chicago. Its angle of 
western vision has always been distorted. 

Upon the whole, this volume is a worthy 
companion to its three predecessors, notwith- 
standing some faults of omission. But why 
should such a dignified and important musical 
work of reference be disfigured with such a 
hodge-podge of mediocre and poorly-executed 
illustrations in these days of pictorial excellence ? 
There is no excuse for it.

The First Coj^sul as a Councillor 
Saw Him.* 



Dr. Fortescue has brought Thibaudeau's 
memoirs of Bonaparte out from the scholarly 
seclusion where for two or three generations 
they have remained practically inaccessible to 
the general reader, who may take his novels in a 
foreign tongue but must have his history in the

vernacular. It is well that their value should 
be emphasized by the fact of translation. The 
frequency with which one meets quotations from 
them in the better books on the period shows the 
estimate which scholars long ago placed upon 
them. They certainly rank with the Memoirs 
of Miot or Mollien, and the Recollections of 
Chaptal. 

Thibaudeau's wide political experience, as 
well as his confidential relations with Napoleon 
and Josephine, enhance the value of his obser- 
vations. He had first come up to Paris with his 
father, who had been chosen a member of the 
States General. He was himself a member 
of the Convention and of the Council of Five 
Hundred. In the Convention he acted with the 
Mountain party, though in no slavish spirit, for 
he refused to join the Paris Jacobin club on the 
ground that this might interfere with the inde- 
pendence of his decisions as a legislator. When 
the Consulate was organized, he was appointed 
a member of the Council of State. If the 
conversations of the Councillor are, as we have 
every reason to suppose, the conversations of 
Thibaudeau, he enjoyed the confidence of Gen- 
eral Bonaparte to such a degree that he could 
frankly express his disapproval of the transfor- 
mation of the Consular government in 1802. 
Bonaparte merely remarked that it was time he 
got rid of his dreams. Josephine also trusted 
him, for she told him of the difficulties and 
anxieties growing out of the intrigues of Napo- 
leon's brothers, who were urging the establish- 
ment of an hereditary regime in order that their 
own position might be magnified. 

The memoirs were written in 1827, when 
Thibaudeau, as one of the regicides who had 
adhered to the government of the Hundred Days, 
was an exile in Brussels. He had already pub- 
lished two volumes of his autobiography, touch- 
ing the periods of the Convention and the 
Directory. They seem to have excited the anger 
of the Bourbon authorities, and, through diplo- 
matic intervention, he barely escaped expulsion 
from the Netherlands. This accounts for the 
fact that in the new volume he abandons the 
autobiographical form and presents anonymous 
recollections, leaving himself quite in the back- 
ground. The lapse of time between the Con- 
sulate and the later years of the Restoration 
would ordinarily impair our confidence in the 
accuracy of Thibaudeau's testimony. There is 
more than one indication, however, that his state- 
ments do not rest upon memory alone, but upon 
notes carefully made at the time. There is a 
passage in the chapter on " Discussions on the 



Civil Code " which gives an important indication 
in this matter. Thibaudeau is criticizing Locre's 
official report of the discussions in the Council, 
because Locre had " reduced all the speeches 
to a cold, measured, uniform style . . . which, 
far from having flattered the First Consul by 
making him speak like the rest . . . detract 
immensely from the freedom, vigour, and origi- 
nality of Bonaparte's own words." In order 
to support his criticism, Thibaudeau placed in 
parallel columns the official version of Bona- 
parte's words " and his actual words as they 
were carefully taken down by another hand. ' ' Dr. 
Fortescue suggests that this other hand was Thi- 
baudeau's, and that he had either an unusual 
verbal memory or a system of short-hand. At 
all events, he ascribes to him special skill in 
reporting debates and conversations, not only for 
this period but also for the periods that preceded. 
He does not throw much light on the reasons for 
his confidence, save that he believes that a com- 
parison of Thibaudeau's reports with others will 
carry conviction of the superiority of his ver- 
sions. From the point of view of the historical 
method, this leaves something to be desired. 

These memoirs cover nearly every phase of the 
Consulate, the organization of the administra- 
tion, the principal problems of the government, 
and even the manceuvres by which the Consulate 
ceased to be a republican and became a monarchi- 
cal government. Perhaps the most important 
chapter is the one already mentioned, the " Dis- 
cussions on the Civil Code." These discussions 
illustrate Bonaparte's share in the making of the 
code. The tone of his remarks must always be 
a surprise to one familiar mainly with the 
Napoleon of diplomacy and war. They are not 
a series of judgments, given with an air of 
finality, but the opinions expressed wear the 
garb of reasonableness. Certain of his remarks, 
recorded in a subsequent chapter where the 
question of taxation is raised, are still more sur- 
prising. He is made to say : 

" There is neither liberty nor property in a country 
in which the amount of taxation to be levied from each 
individual varies from year to year. . . . Why is public 
spirit so wanting in France ? because every proprietor is 
obliged to pay his court to the powers that be. If he falls 
into bad odour he may find himself a ruined man. . . . 
In no other country are the people so servile to the 
Government as in France, because here all property is 
dependent on its good will . . . Nothing has been done 
in France on behalf of property. The man who would 
devise a good law on the cadastre would deservea statue." 

There is much information of the lighter sort 
also in the memoirs. Especially interesting is 
the gi-adual evolution of a court etiquette, the 
stages of which Thibaudeau seems to have

indicated with the minute particularity of a con- 
vinced but somewhat disillusioned republican. 
The reader is amused at the experimental 
changes in official costume, and at the tribula- 
tions of the persons who were obliged to use in 
state processions public cabs, simply covering 
the numbers with paper. Among the minor 
though not unimportant features of this record 
are Napoleon's conversations with Josephine, 
who, Thibaudeau says, though most of a lady 
of all at the new court, detested the theatrical 
effects which were sought, and sighed for greater 
privacy and freedom from false constraint. 

Dr. Fortescue has done his work as editor 
well, though the volume has an unnecessary 
number of misprints or slight errors. It is to 
be hoped that he will carry out the intention 
he announces of presenting a translation of 
Thibaudeau's " Memoires sur la Convention 
et le Directoire." These woidd not have the 
advantage of Napoleon's magical name, an 
important consideration from the publisher's 
point of view, but they make up one of the most 
informing descriptions of the later periods of the 



Revolution.

soul" to self-expression. But one night when he 
has been seated at the piano he is startled by hear- 
ing a sob just outside his window. Rushing out, he 
contrives to capture the agitated girl who has been 
listening to his music ; and in this manner we make 
the acquaintance of one of the most winsome and 
altogether adorable of the heroines of recent fiction. 
Her name is Pamela, but everyone calls her Pam, and 
her daily task is to carry the post. Thus the story 
which concerns her gets its name, " The Post Girl." 
As the story goes on, the Spawer's thoughts become 
in ever-increasing measure detached from his profes- 
sional work, and in corresponding measure attached 
to his new acquaintance. Not to labor the point over- 
much, he falls in love with her, and she is generously 
responsive, albeit her bearing is only such as befits 
the purest and most instinctively refined of maidens. 
But it so happens that the hero's troth is already 
plightedelse where, and he has a conscience. He 
resolves to leave Pam, although it will be like pluck- 
ing out his heart-strings, and the separation is about 
to be effected when an opportune letter (whereby 
hangs still another tale which we have not space to 
include) sets him free. Then there is a stirring 
scene of mutual rescue from the rocks and waves, 
then there is the discovery of Pam's gentle bu'th and 
worldly expectations, and then there is the close of 
of it all, with unlimited happiness in prospect. The 
scenario of Mr. Booth's story is thus of the simplest, 
but he has invested his situations and his character- 
izations with a charm so great that his every chapter 
maintains the reader in a condition of alternate sus- 
pense and satisfaction, both of which are delightful. 
Two other characters are portrayed for us with extra- 
ordinary vividness — those of the loquacious parson 
and of the sullen schoolmaster who also loves Pam 
and almost forces her to his wUl. Besides telling a 
fascinating story, the author puts a good deal of him- 
self into the book, and his many reflective and de- 
scriptive pages give us a happy blend of shrewd 
wisdom and sly humor, to say nothing of their verbal 
beauty. He has a manner almost Meredithian in its 
richness, but without the Meredithian asperity. He 
has given us what is probably the best novel of the 
summer, because it is the most human and the most 
appealing. 

Mr. Harold Bindloss has found a fetching title 
for his latest novel, but " Delilah of the Snows " is 
something of a misnomer, for it apphes only to a 
rather unimportant episode of the book. The story 
is little more than a replica of the author's previous 
productions, telling us again of the struggle for 
fortune and love of the English settler in Canada. 
This time the hero is a gold miner, and the scene 
of his activity is among the mountains of British 
Columbia. The narrative is vigorous and straightfor- 
ward, without nicety of style, but wholesome in tone, 
and moderately interesting. Although his work no 
longer has the freshness of interest it possessed when 
we first made its acquaintance, Mr. Bindloss may 
still be counted upon to tell a readable story.

THE DIAL

Among our audacious latter-day sophists, who so 
neatly make the worse appear the better reason, Mr. 
Chesterton is gaining a high place. Indeed, he may 
almost dispute the honors of leadership with the 
priest-in-chief of the cult of paradox, Mr. G. Bernard 
Shaw. His latest " budget of paradoxes " takes the 
form of a novel — or, rather, of a fantastic invention, 
which has to be described as fiction because it bears 
no conceivable relation to reality. Even the author 
balks at his own imaginings, and passes off the whole 
invention as a dream when he comes to the last chap- 
ter. It is called " The Man Who Was Thursday," 
and has to do with the conflict between anarchy and 
order. A central council of anarchists, seven in 
number, bear the names of the days of the week 
(which accounts for our title), and, under the lead- 
ership of an awe-inspiring Sunday, develop their 
programme of treasons, stratagems, and spoils. The 
gigantic humor of the conception is that these seven 
men are really Scotland Yard detectives, spying 
upon each other ; for each of them thinks that all 
the others are genuine anarchists. The amount of 
fun that Mr. Chesterton gets out of this situation 
may readily be imagined, as well as the opportunity 
it affords him for the exercise of his talent for 
paradox. Like most dreams, the story grows more 
wildly impossible as the awakening is neared. It is 
a highly entertaining yarn, and exhibits the author 
in the light in which he ought always to be viewed 
— the light of a man not for a moment to be taken 
seriously upon any subj.ect, but simply to be ad- 
mired for a combination of nimble wit with diabolical 
cleverness. 

"This is a terribly sensational book," writes 
Father Benson in introducing his " Lord of the 
World " to his readers. Since his story leads up to, 
and ends with, the day of judgment, the preliminary 
warning would appear to be justified. "Then this 
world passed, and the glory of it," is the closing 
sentence of a book as daring in conception as Mr. 
Moody's "Masque of Judgment." The period of 
the story is some centuries ahead of the present time. 
Air-ships and other mechanical inventions are com- 
monplaces, and the problem which confronts man- 
kind is the impending conflict between East and 
West. This menace is finally removed through the 
efforts of a mysterious personage named Felsen- 
burgh, an American who has the gift of tongues 
and an irresistibly persuasive individuality. He is 
haUed as the deliverer of mankind, and the g^eat 
powers of the world unite in making him their 
supreme arbiter. But his triumph is the triumph 
of a godless materialism, and will not be complete 
until the Church, the last bulwark of effete super- 
stition, is wiped out of existence. Consequently, 
the Church is attacked in its central citadel ; Rome 
is annihilated by a fleet of dynamiting airships, and 
the entire hierarchy is believed to be destroyed. 
The triumph of Antichrist (as incarnated in Felsen- 
burgh) seems to be definitive, but a remnant of the 
upholders of the faith has been miraculously spared, 
and has found refuge in Palestine. There it renews 



its organization in a manner suggestive of the times 
of primitive Christianity, and there it awaits the last 
onslaught of the powers of evil. The last day dawns 
upon the field of Armageddon, and the portentous 
approach of doom is impressively pictured. But the 
author's imagination balks at the final cataclysm, 
and puts it all into the simple sentence quoted above. 
A sort of repressed intensity, the product of spiritual 
fanaticism, is the distinguishing mark of this extraor- 
dinary invention. 

Matters of private and sentimental interest are 
woven into the narrative just described, but only in 
a perfunctory way ; in the case of " The Vigil," by 
Mr. Harold Begbie, the element of human interest 
is much more considerable, and yet religious discus- 
sion occupies so large a part of the book as to make 
extensive tracts of it unreadable. The discussion, 
moreover, does not involve the momentous issues 
that appeal to the imagination in Father Benson's 
story, but deals with such futilities as the celibacy of 
the English clergy and the merits of rival methods 
of inculcating Christian doctrine. Fortunately, these 
arid passages are to a certain extent segregated, 
and the author's genuine talent, which lies in an 
altogether different direction, may be enjoyed by 
itself. That talent takes the form of an insight into 
the types of character to be found in an English 
village — a community of miners and fisher-folk — 
that is reaUy remarkable. A combination of the 
shrewd observation and humor of Dickens and 
George Eliot is noticeable in many places, and 
makes the book worth while, despite its heavy load 
of theological verbiage. 

" Retz " is a historical romance vaguely placed in 
the fifteenth century, when the French monarchy 
was still struggling with Burgundy for supremacy. 
The hero, a scion of an ancient German house, ap- 
pears upon the scene in Flanders at the age of 
twenty, and proceeds to carve for himself a career. 
He is at once a doughty warrior, a consummate strate- 
gist, and a Prince Charming ; and he juggles with 
kings and dukes and bishops in right masterful fash- 
ion, until he has settled the affairs of Europe to his 
own taste. The book fairly reeks with romance, and 
bears about as much relation to reality as an Arabian 
Nights' Entertainment. Structurally, it is incoher- 
ent, but its episodes are exciting enough to make us 
condone the fault of amorphous plan. Who Mr. 
Van Zo Post, the author, may be, we do not know ; 
but we cheerfully allow his dedicatory claim that he 
has ever followed the torch of the spirit of adventure. 

We learned to know the Princess Dehra from 
"The Colonel of the Red Huzzars," one of the best 
of recent " Zenda " romances. We now resume her 
charming acquaintance in a book which bears her 
name as a title, for her inventor, Mr. John Reed 
Scott, has ingeniously contrived to make her the 
heroine of a sequel to his earlier romance. The 
device is very simple. The sudden death of the old 
king leaves the court at sixes and sevens, for the 
decree which named Armand his successor has mys- 
teriously disappeared, and the wicked Ferdinand is 



90

thereby enabled to scheme anew for the defeat of 
his rival. So the old days of adventure and intrigue 
are merrily renewed, and the excitement is sustained 
for the length of another volume, and until the lost 
decree turns up, which means the final discomfiture 
of the villain (it seems to be final) and the union of 
Armand with his Princess. 

Mr. Robert Barr is a very uneven writer, being 
capable of producing as puerile a book as " The 
Measure of the Rule " and as fine a specimen of 
historical romance as " Tekla." This unevenness of 
quality seems to result from an attempt to be more 
versatile than nature permits. "■ Young Lord Stran- 
leigh " is one of Mr. Barr's better books — perhaps 
one of his best. Primarily, it is a tale of adventure, 
dealing with the discovery of a rich gold-bearing reef 
near the west coast of Africa, and with the attempt 
of an unscrupidous syndicate to filch the treasure 
from its rightful claimant. As far as plot goes, the 
narrative is commonplace ; but the character of Lord 
Stranleigh gives it the mark of distinction. This 
example of the British aristocracy is to outward seem- 
ing an indolent and lackadaisical creature, whose 
chief interests are his food and his apparel. But 
when he is once enlisted in the effort to thwart the 
wicked syndicate, his affectation of simplicity and 
helplessness turns out to be no more than the mask 
of a highly intelligent and resourceful personality. 
The gold is brought safely to London, and eventu- 
ally saves the Bank of England from bankruptcy, 
which is a sufficiently exciting climax to the story. 
It amounts to some two hundred million pounds 
sterling, which shows the writer to be possessed of a 
generous imagination, 

A rather insignificant novel entitled "Handi- 
capped " is the work of Mr. Emery Pottle. The 
title is suggestive of the race-track, and the story 
has a distinctly " horsey " flavor. The scene is near 
New York, and the interest centres about the rivalry 
for a maiden's hand of two men — an estimable 
country gentleman and a wild Irish youth who is a 
cub by nature and a jockey by profession. The 
maiden yields to the Irishman's tempestuous wooing, 
but is saved from the consequences of her perverse 
judgment by a timely accident (in Madison Square 
Garden) which eliminates him from the situation. 
The story is natural enough, and exhibits some 
skill in characterization and dialogue, but does 
not at any point gain much hold upon the reader's 
attention. 

" Purple and Homespun," by Mr, Samuel M, 
Gardenhire, lives up to its title by introducing us to 
social types as widely separated as the English aris- 
tocracy and the denizens of the East Side. Mr. 
Gardenhire's noble lords and labor agitators are 
depicted with equal verisimilitude. The book also 
provides an agreeable mixture of politics and social- 
ism and financial scheming and human interest. Its 
central figure is a young man of thirty-six who has 
become a millionaire and a United States Senator by 
force of native abUity. His birth is of the humblest, 
and the secret knowledge that his father is a drunken 



old reprobate makes him hesitate a long while before 
declaring his love for the daughter of the British 
ambassador ; but he ventures it at last, with a full con- 
fession, and is rewarded. In this respect the story 
turns out in the anticipated way, but in some others 
it yields surprises. We hardly expect (from a novel- 
ist) that a long-drawn-out sti'uggle between capital 
and labor will end in anything less exciting than a 
riot, but in this case it leads only to amicable adjust- 
ment with the best of feeling on both sides. Nor do 
we expect, when a young woman has been wronged 
in her youth by a scion of the British aristocracy, that 
she will do other than spurn him when she reappears 
as a beautiful and attractive heiress ; but in this case 
she forgives and forgets, even to the extent of marry- 
ing her betrayer. At first thought, these surprising 
conclusions suggest a departure from truth to life ; 
but second thought rather suggests that they are only 
a departure from truth to the novelist's convention, 
and perhaps for that very reason truer to life than 
most novelistic conclusions, Mr. Gardenhire's style 
is stodgy, but he has packed a good deal of experi- 
ence into his pages, and thereby made them quite 
readable, 

Mr. Herbert M. Hopkins, in his "■ Priest and 
Pagan," has given us a neatly-contrived novel of 
somewhat colorless type. The opening smacks of 
romance, for it tells of the reappearance in New 
York of a man supposed to have been drowned in 
the Adriatic a year before; and when we are ap- 
prised of his intention to keep his escape a secret, 
and start life over again under a new name, we anti- 
cipate interesting complications. But they do not 
occur, and the sequel is tame, although it does lead 
to the hero's suicide. He is the "pagan " of the title ; 
the " priest " is the rector of a parish in the Bronx, 
and the heroine, for whom these two contend, is a 
nice girl who seeks relief from her monotonous 
suburban existence by doing a vaudeville " turn " in 
a variety theatre. Mr. Hopkins has more style than 
invention, and it is a pity that so carefully wrought 
a story should not prove more effective. 

The negro question, as viewed by the excitable 
Southern imagination, is the theme of Mr. Robert 
Lee Durham's novel entitled "The Call of the 
South." Mr. Durham has created a disagreeable 
situation, and made the most of it. Hayward 
Graham is a young man of engaging qualities 
descended from a line of soldiers, a Harvard student 
and famous athlete, but cursed with a strain of negro 
blood. He enlists for the war with Germany which 
has has been brought on by Venezuelan complica- 
tions, gives distinguished service to his country, and 
incidentally saves the life of his commanding officer. 
That officer afterwards becomes President, and 
Graham becomes a footman in his household em- 
ployment, having concealed his identity by a change 
of name. The motive for this extraordinary course 
of action is supplied by his secret admiration for the 
younger daughter of the President. A romantic 
entanglement follows between the servant and his 
young mistress, and leads to a clandestine marriage. 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

When the secret is known, the consequences are 
disastrous. The President loses his second election, 
and dies from the shock of disappointment combined 
with the sense of family disgrace. The daughter 
gives birth to a child who is abhorrent to her sight, 
and her mind gives way. Her husband regnlists as 
a private in the Philippine service, and the story 
abruptly ends. The purpose of the book is plainly 
to enforce by a horrible example the argument that 
any attempt to give social recognition to the negro 
must needs result in a mingling of the races. To 
our mind, this is a far-fetched conclusion; but Mr. 
Durham represents the view so widely preva- 
lent in the South and so incomprehensible to the 
Northern mind. The difficulty is a serious one, no 
doubt ; but there is such a thing as losing one's head 
in attempting to deal with it. 

Miss Margaret Potter, after various romantic 
excursions into foreign parts and remote periods, 
has returned, in " The Golden Ladder," to the region 
of reality. It is a very sordid reality which she de- 
scribes, beginning with life in a Chicago boarding- 
house and ending among the financial monarchs of 
Wall Street. Her hero is a sturdy and ambitious 
youth from the country, who comes to Chicago to set 
his foot upon the golden ladder which most unimag- 
inative Americans are trying to climb, and reaches 
the topmost rung in New York, to which metropolis 
the scene is after a while transferred. The heroine 
(we call her that in default of a more exact desig- 
nation) is a daughter of the woman who keeps the 
Chicago boarding-house, a girl of physical charms 
and depraved instincts. She tempts the youth to 
sin, and then, not foreseeing his successful future, 
forsakes him for the garish allurements of the stage. 
When the scene shifts to New York, she is far down 
the road of degradation, while her former lover wins 
high rank among the manipulators of markets and 
the promoters of enterprises. Gilded wretchedness, 
although of different kinds, appears to be the final 
lot of both. Miss Potter's novel is inspired by a 
fierce indignation, aroused at sight of the mammon- 
worship which is bringing our civilization near to 
shipwreck, and she pours unsparing scorn upon 
American life as she sees it. The motive is fine, 
but the thing is overdone, and misses its proper 
effect through vehemence of expression. Charles 
Dudley Warner might have shown her how to do 
the same thing in a more quiet and artistic manner. 
Miss Potter has also to learn the value of reticence, 
for some of her bits of description and dialogue are 
calculated to bring a blush not to maiden cheeks 
alone. On the whole, we are inclined to think that 
" The Golden Ladder " has done a thing well worth 
doing after a fashion in which it distinctly ought not 
to be done. 

We are getting a little tired of the neurotic young 
woman who makes unreasonable demands upon life, 
and is unhappy because it turns out to be less excit- 
ing than she would like to find it. A typical example 
of this sort of woman, who worries over her own 
emotions until her whole moral fibre is weakened, is 



found in the heroine of " The Bond," by " Neith 
Boyce." The marriage bond is what is meant, of 
course, and it is treated throughout the book as some- 
thing against which to chafe rather than as an ac- 
cepted and sacred safeguard. The young woman 
in this particular case has health, a devoted husband, 
and an artistic gift of her own as a refuge from 
vagrant thoughts. She is, in fact, so happy when 
first introduced to us that she is quite sure that it 
cannot last, and deliberately sets out to make herself 
miserable by brooding over an imaginary future of 
misery. This morbid type of character occurs, of 
course, as a by-product of the life which we moderns 
lead at such high pressure, and the novelist has a 
right to describe it ; but she can hardly expect it to 
appeal to the sympathy of sane and balanced minds. 
The heroine's destiny is worked out, after a fashion, 
without external disaster, and she comes to a sort of 
broken-spirited acceptance of life as it is. We could 
wish that the author's delicate talent had been em- 
ployed upon a worthier theme, or a theme bearing a 
closer relation to normal existence.

Briefs on New Books. 



A compact study ^^ ^^uld be difficult to Specify a 
of Rembrandt's book that more completely fulfils its 
life and work. purpose than Professor G. Baldwin 
Brown's volume on Rembrandt (Scribner). To 
condense into a modest volume of 327 pages a 
comprehensive study of the life and art of the dis- 
tinguished Hollander was a task that could be per- 
formed in a satisfactory manner only by one having 
not merely intimate acquaintance with the works of 
the master, but clearly defined views and aptitude 
for methodical statement. These qualifications Pro- 
fessor Brown has in a marked degree, and they are 
reflected in the well-ordered plan of his book. In- 
stead of combining the biographical, the historical, 
and the critical aspects of his subject in a continuous 
narrative, he has treated them in separate divisions ; 
and in considering Rembrandt's output as an artist 
there is a further division into chapters dealing with 
his drawings, his etched work, and his paintings. 
In this arrangement there is both advantage and 
disadvantage. The reader is spared the confusion 
of passing backward and forward between state- 
ments of fact and higher artistic criticism, but at the 
cost of a view in which the artist's works in the dif- 
ferent media necessarily seem somewhat unrelated, 
and the steady progression of his development can 
be kept in mind only by conscious effort on the part 
of the reader. On the other hand, there is gain in 
convenience for reference, and in compactness. In- 
deed, it is extremely doubtful whether such a mass 
of information as Professor Brown gives could be 
presented in the same amount of space in any other 
way. In the discussion of controverted points. Pro- 
fessor Brown is careful to present all sides, and his

conclusions may be accepted as fairly representing 
the consensus of opinion of the best authorities. 
Seldom in a popular monograph does one meet with 
such scholarly treatment, combined with breadth of 
vision and catholicity of judgment. There is perhaps 
a trifle too much insistence upon subjective qualities, 
such as the profundity of Rembrandt's insight into 
character ; and not quite enough stress is laid upon 
the purely aesthetic side of Rembrandt's art. In the 
main, however, the author has kept closely to the 
view which he states with such admirable clearness : 
" The general conception of a piece from the point 
of view of its subject, and its envisagement as a 
composition in form and colour, are, in the theory of 
modern painting, a single act. It is not the case of 
a thought consciously and deliberately clothed in an 
artistic dress, but of a thought that would have no 
existence save in so far as it is expressible in art." 
Without illustrations, a book of this kind would be 
shorn of much of its utUity as well as attractiveness. 
Excellent half-tone reproductions of forty-eight of 
Rembrandt's works are given, the list including a 
number of those not commonly seen, as well as many 
of his recognized masterpieces. Ample indexes are 
included ; and we miss only, what would have been 
a desirable addition, a bibliography of the more im- 
portant among the very large number of books of 
which the great Dutch master is the subject. Taking 
it all in all, Professor Brown has given us the best 
book on Rembrandt's life and work that has been 
prepared for the general reader. 



Without comprehending the principle 
^ZIifaaL^ «f relationship which led Dr. Stop- 

ford A. Brooke to group together four 
such diverse men and poets as Matthew Arnold, A. H. 
Clough, Dante Rossetti, and William Morris in one 
volume with the title " Four Victorian Poets " ( Put- 
nam), we can still appreciate the insight and illumi- 
nation of his treatment of them. A review of the 
history of English poetry from 1822 to 1852 forms 
an introductory chapter, wherein stress is placed 
upon the reaction from the democratic ideas of 
Shelley and Byron, the interval of lethargy, and the 
revival of political, artistic, and religious freedom. 
"Into the midst of this whirlpool of thoughts and 
hopes and passions, political, social, ideal, democratic, 
but chiefly religious and theological, Clough and 
Arnold were cast." These two men are associated 
in our memories both as friends and fellow-sufferers 
from the disturbed intellectual and theological con- 
ditions which tended to foster doubts and a " stoic 
sadness " in the earlier manhood of both poets. " Our 
troubled day " is what Arnold called it. Dr. Brooke 
has said truly that " nearly all of Arnold's best poetry 
has an elegiac note." Clough's mental and spiritual 
conflicts are traced from his Oxford days to the last 
years of a life which seemed to end prematurely, " as 
he passed from the speculative to the constructive 
phase of thought." Rossetti and Morris are natu- 
rally joined in several characterizations ; they both 



rebelled against the sordid life and speculative criti- 
cism of their age, and both, like Keats, turned to the 
past for inspiration. Although Morris in later life, 
urged into contact with the darker phases of existence 
by his " passionate humanity," became enlisted in 
the cause of socialism, yet as a young man he was 
more detached from his age than Rossetti was. The 
latter's quality of " unwearied symbolism," in both 
painting and poetry, is emphasized, as well as the 
fusion of Italian and English influences in his work. 
Morris, like Arnold, was felicitous in his recital of 
great stories of the past, his range of subjects includ- 
ing legends and hero-tales of Greek, mediaeval, and 
Norse history. Whether remembered as a poet, 
socialist, or artistic craftsman, his dominant trait will 
be found in idealism, in hope and faith of a better 
future, poetized in such diverse visions as " News 
from Nowhere " and " The Message of the March 

Wind."

Continental ^t Philadelphia in the autumn of 
Congress, 1755. 1774 and assumed control of national 
affairs until the assembling of the Congress under 
the Constitution was assured in 1789, sat in no less 
than six different places, being the victim of the vicis- 
situdes of war. All general histories describe the 
wanderings of this body of legislative-executives ; but 
it has remained for Mr. Varnum Lansing Collins in 
" The Continental Congress at Princeton " (Univer- 
sity Library) to make a special study of the coming 
of the Congress to Princeton, New Jersey, after the 
revolt of the Pennsylvania troops drove its members 
from Philadelphia. Sessions were opened in the 
classic village (probably in the residence of Colonel 
Morgan) June 30, 1783, and continued until No- 
vember following, when adjournment was made to 
Annapolis. The period was that really following the 
Revolutionary War, and might be considered unin- 
teresting save for the fact that here began to be 
manifest that general apathy in public life which 
eventually well-nigh ruined the experiment of the 
republic before matters were righted by the Phila- 
delphia Convention. Mr. Collins's work is published, 
appropriately, by the University Library of Prince- 
ton, and the author has given a Princeton setting to 
the whole. His chapter on Princeton in 1783, that 
on the reception given the Congressional visitors, and 
on the presence of the members of Congress at the 
annual Commencement exercises of the College, pre- 
sent a true picture of the accustomed quiet of the 
Jersey village, broken by this momentous incursion. 
Monotony of narrative is prevented by the descrip- 
tions of the visit of General Washington to Congress, 
of the arrival of the Dutch minister, and of the theft 
from the vUlage postoffice of a mail-bag which con- 
tained the official correspondence of the members of 
Congress. The author has collected his material from 
original and authentic sources, and has fashioned it 
into a readable narrative. The volume is one that 
wiU appeal to the general reading public, and is yet 
of value to the student.

British Colonial ^ince the publication, two years ago, 
Administration oi Mr. AUeyne Ireland s important 
in the Far East, ^^rk on the " Far Eastern Tropics," 
the appearance of his larger and more important 
work on " Colonial Administration in the Far East " 
has been awaited with interest. The first two 
volumes are now issued, with the imprint of Messrs. 
Houghton, Mifflin & Co. They are given entirely to 
Burma, and excite admiration by their thorough- 
ness and compactness, and wonder at the immense 
amount of labor and preparation which they imply. 
With untiring industry the author has gathered and 
tabulated a vast amount of information on every 
branch of the colonial administration in Burma and 
on every interest in the Province, which has hitherto 
been available only by reference to a multitude of 
scattered reports, issued by many departments, deal- 
ing often with only a limited period of time, avail- 
able only by journeyings to the offices and chanceries 
concerned, and known there frequently only to 
those attached to that particular branch of the ser- 
vice. Mr. Ireland expressly says in his preface that 
"no attempt has been made to make the report 
attractive to the general reader ; no effort has been 
expended in giving the work an appearance of 
originality, which, whilst it might perhaps add some- 
thing to the literary reputation of the reporter, would 
detract from the utility of the work." The work is 
therefore a book of reference only, but it is one of 
distinct and unique value. According to the plan 
which Mr. Ireland has imposed upon himself, his 
own criticisms and conclusions will follow the com- 
pletion of the Report proper, and will be contained 
in a final volume. All the other colonial adminis- 
trations, British and foreign, are to be similarly 
treated, presumably with equal thoroughness and 
accuracy. It is to be hoped that this important and 
meritorious enterprise will appeal not in vain for 
public appreciation and support, especially for that 
of reference libraries where it must become a useful 
and indispensable handbook in its field. 

A pleasant In these days of almost universal 

mixture of • . j i; i, i. ii, ^-u 

guide-book going to and fro about the earth, 

and romance. books of travel vie with fiction in 
popularity as light literature, and the clever author 
has learned to combine the two genres into a divert- 
ing mixture of guidebook and romance. Anne 
Warner's " Seeing England with Uncle John " (Cen- 
tury Co. ) is an unusually entertaining example of this 
type. Uncle John is a truly comic character, as good 
in his way as the inimitable Susan Clegg; and in 
spite of the pitfalls of the sequel, he is just as funny 
in England as he was in France — which means that 
his creator has an excellent understanding of both 
the satiric method and the foibles of the elderly Amer- 
ican gentleman who goes travelling, apparently, just 
to get it over with. Baggage, fires, and Baedeker 
supply Uncle John with standing causes for dissatis- 
faction, while each place he rushes through adds its 
special grievance to his long list of such. His mono- 
logues to his long-suffering companion, DUlyj and to 



his neice Yvonne and her husband, supply the humor ; 
and Yvonne's letters to her mother, recounting the 
various stages in her vain pursuit of Uncle John 
through Scotland and England, describe the things 
that Uncle John might have seen, but did n't, owing 
to his haste and the misadventures that dog his erratic 
course. Yvonne is as typical as Uncle John, and 
almost as funny. Dilly and some of the minor char- 
acters are a little overdone, — and so, we think, is 
Yvonne's ceaseless flow of information, which lacks 
the strongly personal note needed to give it interest. 
As information, however, it seems to be thoroughly 
reliable ; and an index — the preparation of which, 
the author declares, was a much longer task than the 
writing of the book — makes reference to particular 

facts easy.

miliar footnote which shows them to be, in form at

perennially popular novelist and by current appre- 
ciations of his work, while the other ("The Cen- 
tenary of Longfellow") has necessarily much of 
the character of a critical review. The chapters, 
eleven in number, are already famUiar to readers 
of "The Nation"; the Longfellow essay, however, 
appeared in "The Washington University Bulletin." 
In the pages of so accomplished a literary artist as 
Mr. More one looks for, and finds, many an apt 
phrase that lingers in the mind. "The jumping 
staccato of Mr. Chesterton " and " Mr. Chesterton's 
ebullition of doubtful epigrams" refresh us more, 
probably, than they will Mr. Chesterton. 



Notes. 



A volume of " Musical Memories " by Mr. George P. 
Upton, embodying his recollections of famous musical 
artists of the last half-century, is a welcome announce- 
ment by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 

« The Winter's Tale " is the latest volume of « The 
Lamb Shakespeare for the Young," published by Messrs. 
Duffield & Co. in what is not the least pleasing sectiou 
of their " Shakespeare Library." 

In a literary way, doubtless the most important pub- 
lication of the forthcoming season will be Mr. Swin- 
burne's study of " The Age of Shakespeare," which the 
author regards as his most notable prose work. Messrs. 
Harper & Brothers will publish the book in this country. 

New novels by Frederick Palmer, Eden Phillpotts, 
Elizabeth Robins, Edward Peple, Cyrus Townsend 
Brady, John Luther Long, and Tyler de Saix are con- 
tained in the Fall annoimcement list of Messrs. Moffat,

Those who have become interested in the world move- 
ment to provide industrial insurance and old age pensions 
for wage earners will find a new and suggestive treat- 
ment in the recent book of Dr. Alfred Manes on " Die

Mr. Austin Dobson's essays about books are always 
pleasant reading, and many book-lovers will be inter- 
ested to hear that he is preparing a new collection, 
which, under the title " De Libris," will be published in 
this country by The Macmillan Company. 

" With the Battle Fleet," by Mr. Franklin Matthews, 
to be published in the early Fall by Mr. B. W. Huebsch, 
will embody a record of the recent voyage of the Atlantic 
Fleet from Hampton Roads to San Francisco, including 
accounts of the ships' visits to various South American 
ports. 

It is rumored that there exists an unpublished novel 
by Mr. George Meredith, which, according to present 
arrangements, will not be issued for some years after 
the author's death. It is a coincidence that Count 
Tolstoy has lately finished a novel, to which he has 
attached the same condition of posthumous publication. 

As an English novelist, Mr. John Galsworthy has 
now "arrived," and the republication of his earlier 
books is in order. Messrs. G. P. Putiaam's Sons have 
just issued new editions of "Villa Rubein " and "The 
Island Pharisees " for the new public created by the 
authors later successes. 

A volume on Canada in Sir C. P. Lucas's " Historical 
Geography of the British Colonies " will be published 
shortly by the Oxford University Press. The author. 
Professor H. E. Egerton, confines himself to history, 
starting with British Rule to the Quebec Act, and ending 
with the Dominion of to-day; and the volume contains 
several appendices, ten maps, and an index. 

A notable educational book on Houghton Mifflin 
Company's Fall list will be a volume of essays and 
addresses entitled " The Teacher," by Professor George 
H. Palmer and Alice Freeman Palmer. It will have a 
special interest for those who have read the recently- 
published Life of Alice Freeman Palmer, as it will con- 
tain the only papers by her which are to be published. 

An edition of the works of Jane Austen, in ten vol- 
umes, each with a reproduction after water colors by 
A. Wallis Mills, is announced by Messrs. Duffield & Co. 
The text of the novels has been revised for this edition 
by Mr. R. Biimley Johnson, who furnishes also biblio- 
graphical and biographical notes. The water color 
drawings, by one of the artists of " Punch," are an 
attempt to reproduce faithfully the details of the period 
of which Jane Austen wrote. 

There is much bibliographical activity in the United 
States at the present time. Mr. Paul Brochett, of the 
Smithsonian Institution, is preparing a bibliography of 
aeronautics ; Mr. G«orge F. Black's bibliography of gip- 
sies is on the eve of publication, and comprises about 
1800 titles; an elaborate work of the same nature on 
music is being prepared by Mr. L. M. Hooper, of the 
Brookline Public Library ; and proposals for the publi- 
cation of a Canadian bibliography, to contain about 
16,000 titles, have been issued by Mr. A. H. O'Brien, a 
lawyer, and Mr. L. J. Burpee, Librarian of the Carnegie 
Library, Ottawa. We note also that a bibliography of 
Virginia has been undertaken by the Virginia State 
Library; it will relate entirely to the Colonial period, and 
will be prepared by Mr. William Clayton-Torrence. 

The death of Mr. W. S. Smyth, at South Haven, 
Mich., on the 4th of this month, deprived the publishing 
trade of one of its oldest and most esteemed members. 



Mr. Smyth had been for over a quarter of a century 
prominently identified with the publication of school- 
books, at first with the house of Ginn & Co., Boston, and 
later with that of D. C. Heath & Co., of which firm he 
became vice-president, with especial charge of the 
Chicago branch of the business. The earlier part of his 
active life was spent in educational work; graduating 
at Wesleyan University in 1863, he became principal of 
Wyoming Seminary in Pennsylvania, afterwards of 
Casenovia Seminary in New York, and later dean at 
Syracuse University. He was a man of breadth and 
culture, and of high ideals in personal and business life.

No American novel yet Avritten presents so vivid a picture of the exciting early years of the last century — of 
Jefferson and Aaron Burr. The rich background of old Virginia, with its stately homes, its beautiful women, 
and romantic ideals has given Miss Johnston opportunity to tell a moving love story with all the fire and fervor 
that the readers of " To Have and To Hold " so well remember.

Monsieur E. K. Nojine, Accredited Russian War 
Correspondent during the Siege. Translated and 
Abridged by Captain A. B. Lindsay. With carefully 
prepared Map and Illustrations. 8vo. $5.00 net. 
This is an account of all that went on in the fortress 
from the outbreak of hostilities to its surrender in January, 
1905. M. Nojine, who was the accredited war correspondent 
in the fortress, has, in addition to the daily happenings, 
described the moral influences leading to a capitulation, 
which under other circumstances might have been post- 
poned for several months. The book tells of the surrender 
of forts without the knowledge of the Commandant of the 
fortress ; of how General Stossel was twice recalled in June, 
1904, by Kuropatkin ; how he concealed the messages to him- 
self and destroyed the telegrams sent at the same time to 
General Smirnoff, ordering the latter to take over the com- 
mand ; and ends with the final surrender, made in opposition 
to the strongly expressed opinion of the Council of War, and 
without even the knowledge of the Commandant of the fort- 
ress. It tells many secrets, and is the truest condemnation 
of the "old regime " in Russia. 

THE LATER YEARS OF CATHERINE DE 
MEDICI. By Edith Sichel, author of " Catherine 
de Medici." 8vo. Illustrated .... $3.00 net. 
In her " Catherine de Medici " Miss Sichel brought her 
story to the year 1562, and this new volume carries the work 
forward to Catherine's death in 1589. In 1562 Catherine was 
the most important person in France. Whatever conces- 
sions are made for the moral standard of that age, we cannot 
but read with horror and amazement of the unscrupulous 
methods employed in the corrupt politics of the time. In the 
conflict of parties nothing could withstand the lust of power, 
and the lives of great leaders were unhesitatingly sacrificed 
to conserve the throne to Catherine and her sons. The dom- 
inating figure of Coligny, the dramatic contest between him 
and Catherine, his relations with the vascillating King, 
Charles IX., occupy the stage during the ten years between 
1562 and 1572, followed by the culminating horror, the Bar- 
tholomew massacre of 1574. 

The career and character of Catherine are depicted in 
Miss Sichel's pages with lively vigor and mastery of histori- 
cal detail.

Count Baldassare Castiglione is known to fame as the 
author of the " Cortegiano," one of the most popular and 
renowned prose works of the Italian Renaissance, and was 
himself the best type of the perfect courtier whom- he de- 
scribes. The story of his life, in its threefold aspect of soldier, 
statesman, and scholar, is here told, and full accounts are 
given of the brilliant society in which he moved at the Court 
of Urbino, at the Vatican in the days of Leo X„ and when 
he was sent as nuncio to Charles V. in Spain. This corre- 
spondence, both public and private, throws much light on 
contemporary history, and many of his letters in the Vatican 
library are here published for the first time.

1908.] THE DIAL 101 



NEW BOOKS by GEORGE P. UPTON 



MR. UPTON has probably been an observer and writer on musical matters in this country for 
a longer period than almost anyone now living. His contributions to musical literature have 
been many and varied, and his more practical books have come to be regarded as standard. In 
addition to the most thorough knowledge of all possible technicalities, he has been exceptionally 
endowed with a charmingly intimate style, and an almost inexhaustible memory. For the present 
season, besides his invaluable contributions to juvenile literature, he has prepared two volumes widely 
different in character, but both of the greatest possible interest to music lovers, and music students ; 
and in the first book described, to that previous generation which loves to have revived its memories 
of half a century ago. 

MUSICAL MEMORIES My Recollections of Famous Celebrities, 1850-1900. 
Active and aggressive as is music in America in the present day, for the real old timers among music 
lovers it holds no names and achievements like those of the " palmy days " early in the last half of the 
Nineteenth Century. During this entire period Mr. Upton was engaged in active musical criticism in 
Chicago, and had an unusual opportunity to observe what was happening in the musical world. He 
heard all of the great singers, and with many of them he enjoyed an intimate personal acquaintance. In 
these recollections he has drawn almost entirely on his own notes and has made very little use of history 
and biography ; as a result, there is a delightful personal flavor about these reminiscences, a quality of 
kindliness, that makes a rare and genial volume in every sense. As the public is sufficiently familiar in 
these days with artists still upon the stage, he has confined these " Memories " only to those who have 
retired into the shady nooks of life, and to that other goodly company for whom, in the last words of Canio 
in " Pagliacci," " La comedia e finita." 
With many portraits. Large 8vo, gilt top. Net $2.75 

THE STANDARD CONCERT GUIDE a Handbook of the Standard 
Symphonies, Oratorios, Cantatas, and Symphonic Poems, for the Concert Goer. 
Music-lovers who have long found George P. Upton's " Standard Operas " the most comprehensive and 
practical reference work will be delighted to hear that Mr. Upton's three other similar books, covering 
the standard oratorios, cantatas, and symphonies, are now available in one volume, uniform in size and 
appearance with the new edition of "The Standard Operas." In addition to the material already 
mentioned, it has been thoroughly revised and edited, and contains additional matter in regard to the 
leading symphonic poems and works by Bruckner, Cowen, Dvorak, Elgar, Franck, Mackenzie, Parker, 
Parry, Sinding, Richard Strauss, and Tschaikowsky. The text has been made as untechnical as 
possible, so as to be intelligible to those unacquainted with the science of music ; it is, furthermore, 
enriched by the portraits of the composers whose works are described. 
Profusely illustrated. I2mo. Colored top. $1.75 

LIFE STORIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE a Series of Historical Romances 
for Children. Translated from the German. 

The exceptional success which has followed the continuation of this series since the first four volumes were 
brought out some years ago has been exceedingly gratifying to the publishers. The original purpose, 
to provide a real children's library, similar to those in Germany, seems to have found literal acceptance, 
and the preparation of additional volumes has been a labor of love to Mr. Upton and a matter of great 
pride to the publishers. Four new volumes, of which the titles are given below, have been added this 
Fall, making twenty in all.

THE WORL D OF WONDER. 

The scene is in Iceland, and the year is 
1220. There has been a day of battle between 
the Bishop and the opposing chieftains. 

"Arnor said to Sighvat, 'It has been a hard bout, 
kinsman! ' 

"'Aye, hard indeed! ' says he. 

"Arnorsaid: ' I have been poorly all the summer; 
but when word came to me from Reekdale that they 
wanted help, all my aches left me, so that now I am as 
fresh as ever I was in my life.' 

"'That is what you might call a miracle,' said Sighvat. 

" Amor answers : ' It is what I would call an occur- 
rence, and not a miracle.' " 

This anecdote from the sagas is given us by 
Professor Ker in an address made to the Viking 
Club. It has an obvious moral for any age, 
possibly more for our own than for most others, 
and may be particularly recommended to the at- 
tention of those who waste their energies in the 
pursuit of the will-o-the-wisps of certain forms 
of pseudo-philosophy which are much in vogue 
at the present day, and which are the despair 
of the rational intelligence. The conception of 
an ordered and law-bound universe, which is the 
chief conquest of science, and which the advanc- 
ing years steadily solidify, falls dishearteningly 
short of general acceptance. The heredity of 
the race at large predisposes most men to prefer 
imagination to observation, and to welcome what 
is irrational because it satisfies the instinctive 
craving for wonder. 

Now this craving for wonder is too essential 
an attribute of the human spirit to be ignored 
by science, or to be contemptuously ruled out 
of court in the great cause of man versus nature. 
Imagination has a claim upon the mind no less 
legitimate than fact, and the dry light of reason 
is naturally less attractive than the iridescent 
coloring of fancy. But the two are not hope- 
lessly at odds, as a superficial view would seem 
to set them, and the real world of science affords 
abundant scope for the exercise of the faculty 
of wonder. As science extends its boimdaries, 
new Alps on Alps arise before its broadening 
view, and the mysteries which satisfy the child- 
ish imagination are replaced by mysteries of 
more unfathomable depth. The function of 
knowledge is indeed to regulate the imagination, 
but at the same time to afford it a vaster scope 
than ever before. Truly " on her forehead sits

a fire" potent to reveal hitherto unapprehended 
realms of wonder to the clarified vision. But 
just as the truest freedom of human action lies 
within the limits of submission to social law (as 
Goethe knew), so the genuine freedom of the 
imagination is to be achieved, not by flouting 
science, but by accepting its restraining intel- 
lectual guidance. 

The quarrel of science, then, is not with the 
imagination as such, but with its superstitious 
vagaries and its perversities of flight. It clings 
to the toys of childhood when it might instead 
rejoice in the use of the instruments of explora- 
tion which science so freely offers. The cheap 
imposture of " spiritualism ' still numbers by 
thousands its willingly deluded victims, and 
its superstitious taint may be detected, although 
disguised by refined verbiage, in some of our 
highest-sounding philosophies. There is no 
essential difference between the " messages " 
delivered, through knockings or otherwise, by 
the vulgarest of charlatans, and the drivel of 
such familiars as " Mr. Phinuit " as reported 
by our gravest adepts in psychical research. 
That crude manifestations of either sort should 
be taken seriously as attesting the existence of 
a spirit-world affords a melancholy illustration 
of the depths to which credulity may descend. 
It takes Thoreau s vigorous language to char- 
acterize adequately the state of mind which is 
moved by such evidence. 

" Most people here [in Concord] believe in a spirit- 
ual world which no respectable junk bottle, which had 
not met with a slip, would condescend to contain even 
a portion of for a moment, — whose atmosphere would 
extinguish a candle let down into it, like a well that 
wants airing; in spirits which the very bullfrogs in our 
meadows would blackball." 

Mr. Watts-Dunton has dwelt at much length 
upon the fact that the literature of the nine- 
teenth century, in its reaction from the didactic 
materialism of the eighteenth, is chiefly char- 
acterized by a revival of the sense of wonder. 
Man is governed by two great impulses, " the 
impulse to take unchallenged and for granted all 
the phenomena of the outer world as they are, 
and the impulse to confront these phenomena 
with eyes of inquiry and wonder." Yet the 
very century which is thus marked is also the 
one in which positive knowledge has made more 
gigantic strides than in any century preceding. 
So far from deadening the sense of wonder, 
this increasing rationalization of the world for 
human consciousness has made it ever more 
strange in its underlying meaning, and more 
pregnant in its spiritual possibilities. This ap- 
pears to be a paradox, but it is the expression 



of a highly significant truth. Science admits it 
in such words as these of Huxley : " Anyone 
who is practically acquainted with scientific 
work is aware that those who refuse to go be- 
yond fact, rarely get as far as fact." " Natural 
knowledge, seeking to satisfy natural wants, has 
found the ideas which can alone still spiritual 
cravings." But, as we have already urged, 
while science opens new vistas of legitimate 
wonder, there is always the danger for undis- 
ciplined minds, that they will find in its teach- 
ings, imperfectly apprehended, only a new 
warrant for straying into the bog of supersti- 
tion in pursuit of some will-o -the- wisp of the 
unregulated imagination. 

So deep-seated is the irrational instinct in 
our imperfectly developed nature, so prone are 
the most intelligent of men to abdicate at times 
the throne of thought and mingle incognito with 
the superstitious popidace, that one now and 
then almost despairs of the human mind, and 
is tempted to give up the strenuous search for 
ultimate truth and take refuge in that comfort- 
able philosophy which teaches that truth is 
whatever men wish to believe and think is good 
for them. This sugar-coated gospel of intellec- 
tual despair, this specious plea for opportunism 
in the management of the intellectual processes, 
is just now very much in fashion, but its evasion 
of all the difficulties at issue does not exactly 
commend it to the entirely serious thinker. It 
is discouraging, indeed, to make a list of some 
of the men who have most deeply influenced 
our modern age, a list including such men as 
Carlyle and Ruskin and Arnold and Renan and 
Tolstoy, men whose nobility of temper com- 
mands our respect and even our veneration, and 
then ask, with a recent English critic : " Is there 
any one of them who has not tried at times to 
storm our judgment instead of convincing it, or 
has not bewildered our mind by some perversity 
or extravagance?" 

The critic just quoted is writing about Lord 
Morley, who stands in contrast with such men 
as have above been named because "he never 
leaves us in doubt about his meaning, motive, 
or method." And then follows this striking 
sentence : " The chief reason why he is a stand- 
ard writer is that he is a standard mind, and at 
a time when standard minds are rare." Now 
the standard mind does not waver before the 
gusts of doctrine, because it is convinced of a 
fundamental order in the universal structure. 
But its abiding belief in such an order serves 
only to heighten its sense of wonder as it studies 
the workings of the cosmic process. Such a 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

conviction does not desiccate the mind, but 
swells it with the sap of luxuriant growth. It 
is Lord Morley who, in the very cause of war- 
fare upon superstition, pays tribute to the 
" moods of holiness, awe, reverence, and silent 
worship of an unseen not made with hands " 
which are among the unalienable riches of the 
human spirit. The mind that has truly recon- 
ciled itself with universal law does not chafe 
under the salutary restraint, and the wonders 
which it has discarded as childish figments give 
place to others, sublimer far, as the imagination 
rises to loftier planes. In the new world of 
wonder thus revealed there is abundant room 
for romance, even if ghosts are banished, and 
for a religious faith that needs no miracles as 
crutches to support its tottering footsteps, but 
that stands erect in its own strength, with shin- 
ing eyes directed toward the unseen. ^ 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



The iniquities of book-publishers form a 
theme apparently of perennial charm. Just why 
this particular class of business men should be singled 
out for wholesale reprobation in the public prints 
would be harder to understand were we not to take 
into account the nature of their business and the usual 
source of the attacks. The production and sale of 
books, while essentially a commercial function, is in 
a sense a semi-literary one also, and this makes its 
doings and methods matters of interest in the literary 
world. Then it is an old, old story, that the relation 
of publisher and author is one that it is not always 
possible to manage sweetly ; and when disagreements 
come and antagonisms arise, what more natural than 
that the author with a grievance, imaginary or real, 
should find his handiest and most effective weapon 
in his pen ? He is, in fact, too handy in its use ; he 
is often hasty, sometimes angry, and liable to write 
not wisely but too well. Such a Boanerges of the 
pen has lately appeared in the columns of the once 
decorous " Academy " of London, in an article bear- 
ing the ingratiating heading, " The Insolent Pub- 
lisher." Of course after such a happy beginning we 
know at once that all will go affably and well. And 
we are not disappointed; the gentleman certainly 
has a full pen, and writes up to his heading. To 
him, the Publisher (generically speaking; he does n't 
bother with him individually) is not only " insolent " 
wherever his dealings with authors are concerned, — 
he is " a huckster in intellect," " ignorant and puffed 
up," '' impudent, greedy, vain," as lacking in courtesy 
and manners as he is " pusillanimous " and imbecile 
in his business methods. He has various other un- 
desirable qualities, but the chief and most unendur- 
able one is his invsuperable insolence. He has " an 
insolent view of the public, an insolent and contempt- 



uous view of the serious author, and an insolent and 
contemptuous view of the whole business of letters "; 
with the crowning culpability of being " a waddling 
mass of insolence." With which unflattering picture 
of the lordly British publisher, we leave him to the 
mercies of his countrymen and his reckoning with 
the Society of Authors. Coming back to our own 
land, we find a recent article, very different in sub- 
stance as well as in regard for the amenities of civil- 
ization, not to say of literature, but containing some 
pretty strenuous criticism of book-publishers, in the 
pages of " The Atlantic Monthly." This article is 
on " Honest Literary Criticism " — something which 
it says does not exist in America. This is rightly 
regarded as a grave defect ; and the charge against 
the publishers is a serious one when the author de- 
clares that the fault is primarily theirs. This charge, 
repeated in many forms, runs through the dozen 
pages of the article. This author too has his bogy, 
which he tirelessly pursues. Not the publisher in 
his capacity of Insolent One, but in that of the Silent 
Bargainer, is the object of his attack. " The Silent 
Bargain " — something weird and mysterious, like 
Lawson's furious one-sided combat with "The Sys- 
tem " or Faust's compact with the Devil — is the 
device by which American publishers have accom- 
plished the wholesale debauchery of American lit- 
erary criticism. This sinister "Silent Bargain" is 
made by the book-publisher with the publisher of 
book reviews, and consists simply in the use of adver- 
tisements as bribes for favorable notices of books. 
It is a quiet affair, but business-like and effective : 
nothing need really be said, — the understanding is, 
"No favorable notices, no advts," and that is all 
there is about it. This is the spirit and the practice, 
according to this writer, dominating literary criti- 
cism in this country. The statements are made in 
a large generic sense — like saying that all men are 
liars, which even in our hlase day is thought too 
sweeping, and likely to do injustice to the few pos- 
sible exceptions when a comparatively truthful man 
is found here and there in the byways and corners 
of the land. It may be that the rash Scriptural 
generalizer's preliminary utterance — "I said in my 
haste" — could be meditated with profit by this 
froward critic of criticism in America.

The life of a busy and useful bookman was 
that of Mr. A. R. Spofford, which came to an end 
last month, after more than fourscore years. Mr. 
Spofford began active life, before he was twenty 
years old, as a bookseller and publisher in Cincin- 
nati ; he then spent several years in journalism, in 
the same city. His life-work, however, was in the 
Congressional Library at Washington, where, as 
librarian or assistant, he was in continuous service 
for nearly half a century. Mr. Spofford's interest 
in books did not concern merely their care and cus- 
tody ; his knowledge of their contents was prodi- 
gious, and covered all subjects and many languages. 
If a visitor to the library wished material for a 



106

[Sept. 1, 



speech, an article, a sermon, or a book, Mr. Spofford's 
ready hand, guided by his inexhaustible memory, 
found at once the desired volume, — if not on the 
crowded shelves of the old Congressional Library, 
then with equal readiness it was plucked from the 
pile upon the floor, the desk, the chair, the table, 
wherever it temporarily reposed in a disorder that 
was hopeless to others but never seemed to trouble 
him. Sometimes when a book was not in his own 
library he would tell at once in what library it could 
be found, and even its location — in what particular 
stack or alcove, on what shelf, and even what posi- 
tion on the shelf ; and he was seldom at fault, either 
in locating the book or in its proving to be the right 
one for the case. But with all his wonderful knowl- 
edge of books, there was one kind that he could not 
or did not care to understand — account books ; and 
this defect at one time came very near involving 
him in a serious difficulty with the Government. 
Mr. Spofford as librarian had charge of fees received 
from copyrights entered in his office as required by 
law; and when his accounts were audited, in 1895, 
it was found that he was $22,000 short. This was 
an astounding disclosure — probably to no one more 
so than to Mr. Spofford. He had no idea what had 
become of the money, and as no one suspected him 
of dishonesty his friends made good the shortage and 
the Government accepted the settlement. When, a 
little later, the library was removed to its new build- 
ing, the astonishing discovery was made that the 
drawers in Mr. Spofford's desk contained large 
amounts of money — bills, money orders, checks — 
stuffed away among dusty papers accumulating 
during a period of a quarter of a century. He was 
allowed to keep the money, which he had already 
replaced, but was wisely relieved of further responsi- 
bilities of a financial nature. The position of assist- 
ant librarian, which he held for the last ten years 
of his life, pleased him better, as it enabled him to 
give all his time and energies to the kind of books 
he really understood — which, as has been said, 
included all kinds but account books. 
• • • 
The advantages of the smaller colleges is 
a matter much discussed of late, particularly in 
connection with Mr. John Corbin's book, " Which 
College for the Boy ? " lately reviewed in our pages. 
The interest of the subject may justify a quotation 
from a thoughtful and sensible letter that has come 
to our notice in a New York journal. " Why these 
plaints," asks the writer, "from discouraged mothers 
and others about popular education in the East, 
when there are a dozen or more colleges whose 
doors are open at trifling expense to the ambitious 
and industrious student, institutions which offer as 
good courses in the classics, modern literature, 
mathematics, history and philosophy, as the large 
university ? " Then follows some not extravagant 
praise of the writer's own college, Middlebury, in 
Vermont, where his " fees to the college during the 
entire four years' course amounted to less than 



. . The great universities have their advan- 
tages, and they are open to those who can afford 
them. By many, however, the advantages of the 
small college, for undergraduate work, are con- 
sidered superior, irrespective of expense. Be that 
as it may, the small New England college offers to 
those of slender purses four years of wholesome, 
gladsome life in the country, and a college educa- 
tion the worth of which is dependent upon the char- 
acter of the student himself." It is the after life 
in the great world that tests the worth of the pre- 
paratory training, and many useful lives and noble 
characters owe much of their foundation to the 
smaller but by no means inferior colleges, in the 
West as in the East. The " still air of delightful 
studies " so dear to Milton is not exactly the prev- 
alent air at our monster universities, with their 
students numbering into the thousands, and their 
activities and interests counted by the score or by 
the hundred. ... 

Free libraries in the Dark Continent are 
shooting their radiant beams in an ever-widening 
circle. Not that public libraries are yet very plenti- 
ful in the Desert of Sahara or in the rubber forests 
of the Congo ; but in South Africa, within the juris- 
diction of Dr. Muir, Superintendent General of Edu- 
cation in Cape Colony, there has been a rapid growth 
of these institutions within the last fifteen years. The 
schoolhouse serves as the natural depository for these 
collections of books ; the separate library building 
will come later. The remarkable growth in this 
department of public education is thus reported by 
the Superintendent: "In 1892 there were only 
twenty-two school libraries in circulation ; five years 
later there were 123 ; the following five years saw 
the number doubled, and the total of 1902 (247) 
was trebled by 1907 (733). But the past twelve 
months have witnessed the most remarkable headway 
of all, for in May, 1908, there were no fewer than 
1548 libraries scattered throughout the schools of the 
colony. These libraries are somewhat unevenly dis- 
tributed among the different school board areas, and 
in size they range from the modest bookcase, with 
its couple of dozen books, in many a private farm- 
school, to the well-stocked shelves of some of our 
colleges, where a couple of thousand volumes are 
available. The Cape division is in the proud posi- 
tion of having a library for every school, and the 
combined collections, if we mistake not, contain some 
30,000 books." . . . 

The sterility of optimism, so far as the pro- 
duction of soul-stirring works of literature is con- 
cerned, is touched upon by the London "Nation" 
almost at the same time (curiously enough) with 
Mr. Charles Leonard Moore's treatment of the 
theme in the course of his recent Dial article on 
" The Solidarity of Literature." Mr. Moore made 
our optimism and lack of depth " largely due to our 
material success, and to the fact that we have never 
known, as a nation, defeat, despair, and crushing 
grief." A remarkable similarity of thought is to be 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



107 



noted in the English writer's article. " What 
weighs on our novelists," he declares, "with even 
greater pressure [than insincerity in dealing with sex 
problems] is the optimistic idealism which has the 
greatest aversion for any picture of life that is 
sombre, tragic, or even uncompromising. This 
mental temper . . . makes directly for lack of depth 
in our novelists. . . . Should our national prosperity 
have to meet the rude shock of a European war, or 
grave peril to any part of the empire, we should 
immediately see arrive a far more serious school of 
writers to interpret for us the handwriting on our 
walls." Illustrations of the quickening influence of 
national adversity upon a nation's literature are 
spread before us in the history of Italy, of Poland, 
of Hungary, — and, prosaically prosperous though 
we are, of our own country in its internecine conflict 
over slavery. Yet, though we do not deny the soul 
of goodness in things evil, and the office of suffer- 
ing in revealing life's deeper meanings, it is hard to 
believe that misery and anguish and even the dark- 
ness of deadly sin constitute the only soil whence 
springs the literature of power. " L' Allegro " has 
its potent charm no less than " II Penseroso." 

• • • 

The kindliness of authors has been less 
written about than their irritability and bad temper. 
Walter Savage Landor's tempestuous outbursts of 
passion are more striking than Louise Chandler 
Moulton's little unremembered acts of kindness and 
of love. The throwing of a dinner service — china, 
silverware, viands, tablecloth and all — out of the 
window into the garden, is more theatrical than 
listening on a bed of pain to a would-be novelist's 
reading of his own crude attempts at story-writing ; 
nevertheless one is glad to preserve the memory of 
such unobtrusive services to struggling authors, — 
and Mrs. Moulton's life was full of them. As a 
sympathetic notice of her death puts it, "she did 
not seek requital ; she did not demand gratitude ; 
she asked only opportunity to confer benefits. Her 
reward was to be beloved to a degree known to very 
few women." She seems to have had no enemies, 
impossible though it is often asserted to be to make 
warm friends without at the same time creating 
enmity in other quarters. Even envy and malice 
from her own sex shrank ashamed from attacking 
one so eager to turn her own success to the profit 
of others. 

• • • 

Open or closed shelves for public libraries 
is a matter in which a judicious compromise seems 
the better plan. Sufficient freedom for practical and 
sensible purposes can be given without turning the 
public loose in the book-stack, while special permis- 
sion for unrestricted freedom can be accorded in 
special cases. This plan, already noted by us as in 
operation at Peoria, is favored by Mr. Ranck, the 
Grand Rapids librarian, whose methods and aims 
have occasionally in the past furnished matter for 
approving comment in these columns. In his recent 
Annual Report he says : " The need of a larger place 



in which to keep a well-selected collection of twelve 
or fifteen thousand volumes is being felt more and 
more every year. A collection of this number of 
volumes would answer the needs of perhaps 80 or 
90 per cent of the adults who use the Circulation 
Department; and to have a relatively small, well- 
selected collection of this kind would be of greater 
service than to have free access to the whole collec- 
tion of the Library's books." The whole collection, 
it may be added, is about ninety-three thousand 
volumes. ... 

How to enjoy books, though a librarian, is 
not an insoluble problem, any more than is " how to 
be happy, though married." For the third time in 
its more than thirty years' history, the American 
Library Association at its late convention devoted 
its attention to books rather than to methods of 
handling and housing and circulating books. Such 
papers as that by Mr. Henry E. Legler, of the 
Wisconsin Public Library Commission, on " The 
Dear and Dumpy Twelves," and the one by Dr. 
Thwaites on " How to Get Parkman Read " — 
followed by bright, snappy, two-minute talks on 
various noteworthy books — helped to remind the 
assembled librarians that literature may serve other 
uses besides cataloguing and classifying and shelf- 
listing and gum-labelling. Those who (often to their 
sorrow) have so much to do with the mere outsides 
and perishable materialities of books like now and 
then to have it newly impressed upon them that 
worth makes the book, the want of it the tiresome 
imitation, and the rest is all but leather (or more 
often cloth) and laminated wood-pulp. 
. • • 

The vogue of devotional hymns, when the 
hymns really appeal to the people, is something pass- 
ing belief. That the collection of " Gospel Hymns " 
bearing the name of Ira D. Sankey, who has re- 
cently died, was a popular book, must have been 
patent to anyone at all curious in the matter. The 
occasion of the hymn-writer's death has brought to 
public notice the fact that this work and the same 
author's, or more properly compiler's, " Sacred 
Songs," " Gospel Choir," and " Christian Endeavor 
Hymn Book " have circulated to the extent of more 
than fifty million copies. And yet there are those 
who assert that the English and the Americans are 
not music-lovers. Perhaps they would even cite the 
foregoing in confirmation of their assertion. 

• • • 

Base uses of famous houses might furnish a 
theme for a long chapter in literary history. The 
same wind that wafts to our shores reports of the 
saving of Coleridge's house at Nether Stowey, of 
Johnson's father's house at Lichfield, of Balzac's 
house in the suburbs of Paris, and of other historic 
dwellings, brings news of the conversion of Ruskin's 
Denmark Hill house at Camberwell, where he wrote 
parts of "Modern Painters," into "a boarding-house 
for gentlemen." Surely, the irony of fate could no 
farther go.

COMMUNICA TIONS. 



MILTON'S " COMUS " IN WESTERN WOODS. 
(To the Editor of Thb Dial.) 
The writer thinks it but a simple act of justice, as 
well as a matter of interest to your readers, to make 
some mention in your columns of a literary event of such 
merit and distinction as the recent open-air perform- 
ances of Milton's " Comus " by the Donald Robertson 
Company at Ravinia Park. It is not often that those 
who care for the greatest poetry are offered such an 
opportunity of high enjoyment. It must be admitted, 
first of all, that there were serious flaws in at least the 
rendering seen by the present writer. The worst of 
these were a number of most regrettable lapses of 
memory, by most of the actors, in the delivery of the 
lines, every syllable of which is sacred to the lover 
of poetry. Then, the parts of the two Brothers were 
very inadequately conceived, and distinctly below the 
level of the other acting. Again, one could have dis- 
pensed with some part of the uproar, especially that of 
the dancing village swains, which too closely recalled 
that of Comus's crew, but lately subsided. 

But one is glad to have done with these obvious 
criticisms, and go on to the grateful task of trying to 
express something of the delight which the masque 
awakened. Turf and trees and moonlight contributed 
their gentle influences; but the charm, the real poetic 
atmosphere, emanated from the actors who so fully 
entered into the power and beauty of the verse. Of 
course the recitation of lines so complex, with inversions 
and word-uses so remote from the familiar, is one of 
the difficulties of the piece, increased by the conditions 
of delivery in the open air. Another is the great length 
of the speeches; while of course not all minds can be 
moved by the lofty thoughts which inspired Milton in 
the composition. But these obstacles seemed, for the 
most part, to lend wings to the imaginations of Mr. 
Robertson and his chief players. Miss Marion Redlich 
as the Attendant Spirit, and Thyrsis, Miss John as the 
Lady, and Mr. Robertson as Comus, were more than 
satisfying; they really inspired. They delivered the 
great verse with a fitting sense of its meaning and 
beauty; they succeeded in creating a genuine poetic 
illusion; they brought out to the full the deep spiritual 
force of the piece. Miss Redlich brought to the part 
of the Spirit a high sweetness and earnestness which 
made the shepherd disguise ever transparent, and 
opened and closed the action with a worthy music. 
Mr. Robertson's Comus well expressed Milton's con- 
ception, — a being rooted in sensual evil, yet intellectual 
enough to play the philosopher and to find the best part 
of the game in the enslavement of others ; high enough, 
also, to feel the moral beauty of the Lady, and to quail 
and suffer before its light. The beautiful imaginative 
poetry of the lines received from Mr. Robertson a treat- 
ment truly sympathetic. 

Of Miss Alice John as the Lady one hardly knows how 
to speak without seeming extravagance. The nobility 
of her conception of the part was assisted by her per- 
sonal graces, her nobility of head and form and bearing. 
Simplicity was rightly the key-note of all. Milton's 
own Lady was a gentlewoman, acting a heightened and 
transfigured version of an experience of her own, made 
lastingly beautiful by the utmost art of a great poet. 
As such a gentlewoman, under such conditions, appeared 



Miss John. Nothing there was of the cheap or mere- 
tricious, nothing of the trivial twang of the stage. At her 
first appearance, lost in the benighted wood, a girl's fright 
and weakness were expressed as simply but convinc- 
ingly as Madame Modjeska used, on her first entrance 
in " Twelfth Night," to put before us the sufferings and 
weariness of the shipwrecked Viola. But her womanly 
strength shines out when, in her perplexity, she resolves 
to have faith, to trust the promised protection of Comus ; 
and its clear unquenchable light beams still but radiant 
throughout the temptation scene. Miss John's work is 
too quiet, with the quietness of strength, fine and true, 
to catch the applause of those whom only contortion and 
violence can move ; but all who care for the deep beauty 
of this scene must find satisfying food for thought in 
her rendering of it, — her calm reliance, amid the obvi- 
ous bewilderment of sense, on an inward strength; her 
expression of profound, still passion of the soul, which 
leaves the mind all clear to refute the wily sophistry of 
the false god. 

The delicious song and dancing of the nymph Sabrina 
(Greorgie Kennicott) in her rush-and-lily adorned dress, 
with water-sprites attending, delightfully closed the main 
action of the piece, whose incidental music, it must be 
added, is as charming as Milton's praises would lead us 
to fancy. 

Milton's genius was not dramatic, and a masque is 
not a play. The interplay of action and emotions on 
individuals is not the interest to seek in such a com- 
position, which is to the full drama somewhat as early 
Tuscan bas-relief to sculpture in the roimd. The Comus 
indeed " masks " in the guise of persons high thoughts 
and the passion of Milton's philosophic youth. To suc- 
ceed, as these actora have done, in making poetry so 
lofty and so exquisite live and take shape, is a high 
achievement. Marian Mead.

A CORRECTION FROM CAPTAIN AMUNDSEN. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In connection with your review of Captain Amund- 
sen's book, " The North- West Passage," in The Dial 
of August 16, we note in the last paragraph that your 
reviewer points out some inaccuracies in the text, namely, 
first of all that the " Gjoa " is made to sail through 
Bellot, wliile the context and map show that it passed by 
it. We have the following letter from Captain Amundsen 
on this matter — and it seems only fair to him that some 
acknowledgement shoidd be made, as the error seems 
to be due entirely to the translator. 

" The editor of The Athenaeum sends me this morning his 
journal of the 11th July with a notice concerning my book, 
in which he tells me that I have been wrong in some names 
when I say that I passed ' through Bellot Strait.' I have 
now been looking to this, and find that there has been an 
error in the translation of my book, which please state as 
follows. In the original text, p. 44, 1 say, in speaking about 
the Bellot Strait: 'Kl. 8 om morgenen passerte vi saa 
straedet,' which has been translated by you : ' At 8 A. M. we 
passed through the strait;' but ought to have been, 'At 
8 A. M. we passed the strait,' not through. It is a very bad 
mistake, which ought to be rectified as the difference is a 
very great one to everybody who studies the geography of 
the book." 

In justice to Captain Amundsen, we hope you will 
give space to this letter. j^ p Dxjtton & Co.

An Experiment in Art Education.* 



That Professor Sir Hubert von Herkomer, 
eminent artist and art teacher, and for nine years 
Slade Professor of the Fine Arts at Oxford, oc- 
cupying there the chair recently left vacant by 
Ruskin, should have pronounced and original 
views on the subject of art education, is only 
what one would expect and desire. His book, 
" My School and My Gospel," describing his 
twenty-one years' experiment in art education 
at Bushey, is a sort of apologia pro arte sua, 
and, as such, is not wanting in that personal and 
distinctive element that seldom fails to impart 
interest and reality to the narrative in which it 
is present. 

It was in 1883 that the Bushey school, des- 
tined to become rather famous in the world of 
art, opened its doors to some twenty-five pupils 
of both sexes, the only requirement for entrance 
being " a head from life, drawn in charcoal," 
and the tuition fees being nothing whatever. 
The enterprise was purely a labor of love. Its 
author had " made his career," as he expresses 
it, and he wished to put to a practical test 
certain pet theories of his own in art education. 
Under such conditions, the school was Professor 
Herkomer, and Professor Herkomer was the 
school. Of the first beginnings he writes : 

" We were making a school under conditions never 
perhaps before attempted — a school of art in a village. 
It was all an experiment, and no master in the world 
could have made it a success without the full-hearted 
and enthusiastic co-operation of the students. It was 
my good fortune to have the right material at the be- 
ginning, which was all-important for such a novel 
undertaking. An art atmosphere had to be created, 
and nobody, who has not tried to make a special atmo- 
sphere of this kind, can know what the task entails." 

The effect of the school on the sleepy little 
village was interesting : the atmosphere created 
by master and pupils seems to have pervaded 
the primitive hamlet, to some extent, and to 
have caused a desire in those breathing it for 
some of the refinements and luxuries of modern 
life which they had hardly given a thought to 
before. A few words now on the peculiar doc- 
trine taught at Bushey. The author tells an 
anecdote of a famous painter who, every day, 
before putting brush to canvas, knelt down and 
prayed fervently to be protected from his model. 
In much the same way the Bushey art students 
seem to have been taught to pray for protection 

• My School and My Gospel. By Professor Sir Hubert von 
Herkomer, C.V.O.. R.A.. D.C.L., etc. Illustrated. New York: 
Doableday, Page & Co. 



from their master. The personality of each 
pupil, his idiosyncrasy even, the distinctive 
quality of his work, was what the teacher tried 
to reach and develop. 

" The result of this method of teaching has been that 
the world cannot recognise my pupils in their works, 
and it will probably be said that I left no ' school ' behind 
me. But I never could understand the advantage of 
squeezing the supple mind of a young painter into a 
master's manner, from which he may never wholly extri- 
cate himself. It was the word ' quality ' that most puz- 
zled and baffled the students ; the weaker thought it was 
something / wanted, and did not realize that it was an 
essential part of good art. The word was on every lip ; 
it was heard in the street of sleepy Bushey; it was heard 
in the social gatherings of the students; it was the last 
thought of the student when he went to bed, and the first 
when he got up. This question of quality certainly was 
the most difficult thing to get them to understand. How 
thankful I was when at last I could point to a particular 
part in a study that had attained the desired quality; and 
how bitterly disappointed I felt when I saw it slip away 
again, sometimes to return no more." 

Elsewhere in the book he says : "I made the 
very foundation of my teaching ' the awakening 
in the student of the sensitiveness to painter-like 
qualities,' and the discovery of individual bent. 
By this method it was interesting to note how 
every successful student produced a different 
kind of quality and brush work, clearly proving 
that the insistence on that phase in the technique 
in no way interfered with the development of his 
own personal idiosyncrasy." In this teacher's 
system, care was taken that theory should follow 
and not precede practice. " The student must 
' build up,' as it were, on himself first ; he must 
make some edifice in which to house the wider 
and immovable principles that underlie aU mon- 
umental art. No master can be the builder of 
that edifice." It was another marked feature of 
Professor Herkomer's system to give personal 
advice and assistance to his pupils after they left 
his school and launched out for themselves. 
Their emancipation, wisely or not, was made 
gradual. They took studios in the village, under 
the master's eye, and were encouraged to consult 
him freely. Thus the abruptness of passage 
from the life class to the painting of portraits 
professionally, or the execution of other inde- 
pendent work, was modified for them, greatly to 
their advantage if we may credit their teacher. 
The discontinuance of Professor Herkomer's 
teaching, after twenty-one years of signal suc- 
cess, and the closing of the Bushey school prob- 
ably forever, were due to something like an 
accident — some legal difficulty concerning build- 
ings and grounds. On such slight events do the 
destinies of empires and of art schools depend. 
But those were crowded years of glorious life for

the founder and head of the school. What he tells 
us incidentally of the by-products of his own and 
his pupils' industry — the mezzotint engraving, 
the music-composing, the play-writing and play- 
acting and scene-painting, the school-magazine 
writing and editing, and other pursuits congenial 
to artists — makes it plain that a full and busy 
and sanely enjoyable life was lived at Bushey in 
those days. Considerable space and a number 
of illustrations are devoted to the highly success- 
ful and somewhat famous dramatic performances 
given in the master's private theatre at Bushey 
and attended by celebrities from the great world 
outside — all, of course, untainted by the slight- 
est suggestion of commercialism or professional- 
ism or of anything but the pure love of art. An 
excellent story is told of an outsider's attempt to 
turn to personal profit a charity performance of 
the Herkomer company by buying up aU the 
tickets in advance and advertising them for sale 
at double the price paid. But the artist theatre- 
manager turned the tables on the speculator by 
immediately advertising two additional charily 
performances of the same play, with tickets at the 
old price. The mortifying and pecuniarily dis- 
astrous result to the speculator can be imagined. 
Of this portion of his life, when manifold 
interests and occupations were crowding every 
waking hour and not a few that should have 
been given to sleep, the author, who confesses 
himself to have been ever a glutton for work, 
says : 

" This was the period of my life when the work I 
imposed upon myself was so excessive that even greed 
could ask for no more. I worked at my portraits 
and subject-pictures, and I did etching as usual, con- 
sidering these to be my first duty. But to this all- 
sufficient labour must be added the designing of details 
for my house, which was in course of erection; the 
preparation of lectures for Oxford, where I held the 
Slade Professorship; the uninterrupted attendance at 
my school; the building-up of a stage-picture for the 
play; the writing of music for the same; the irritating 
work of correcting the copied parts for the orchestra; 
and, finally, the most severe strain of all on the nerves 
— the rehearsing of a new play. I leave it to the reader 
to judge if this was a normal state of things. Yet dur- 
ing these months of excitement I was in good health, 
and retired to bed long after midnight without any 
feeling of fatigue. I had no assistance from stimulants, 
as I was a water-drmker and a non-smoker. But it was 
the result of the domination of mind over body for 
the time being — a condition, however, that could not 
last. Nor did it; for I have since paid the price for 
that pleasure- period in long years of bad health." 

In the course of his narrative the author takes 
occasion to illustrate his theory of personality in 
art by an apt quotation from Mark Twain. 

" But methods of work are as various as are the 
temperaments of human beings. The mystery of tem- 



perament — or call it a ' person's nature ' — is interpreted 
by that master, Mark Twain, thus : « Through all this 
steady drift of evolution the essential detail, the com- 
manding detail, the master detail of the make-up re- 
mains as it was in the beginning, suffers no change and 
can suffer none; the basis of the character, the temper- 
ament, the disposition, that indestructible iron frame- 
work upon which the character is built, and whose shape 
it must take, and keep throughout life. We call it a 
person's nature.' " 

The rich and varied experience of the author, 
who was, with his other tastes and gifts, some- 
thing of a psychologist, gives meaning and value 
to the following reflection : 

" In my readings of psycho-physiological works, I 
have not yet found an explanation of that mysterious 
cerebral condition, when a man suddenly feels he is ripe 
for a certain mental action. A stray word from another 
person may effect the ignition in the brain, and cause all 
the faculties required for that mental action to spring 
into life. It was ever so with me. A word from a col- 
league started my etching period ; a word pointed to, and 
set me on to, enamelling; a word (and that from my 
eldest son, when he was only a Harrow boy) proclaimed 
the moment for the theatrical venture; even this book 
is the outcome of a word from a literary friend." 

And the " literary friend " deserves our 
thanks. The story is told in a clear, rapid 
style, enlivened by frequent touches of humor, 
and, with all its fine and high idealism, exhibit- 
ing a keen, practical common sense and a know- 
ledge of the world and its human inhabitants 
that not all devotees of art are noted for possess- 
ing. There is something, too, of the sixteenth- 
century Italian craftsman's resource and ver- 
satility in Sir Hubert von Herkomer. Born in 
Florence three centuries earlier, he might have 
been a second Benvenuto Cellini. He has cer- 
tainly proved his ability to write an autobio- 
graphic narrative not less interesting in its way 
than CeUini's. The illustrations, mostly by the 
author or his pupils, are many and full of char- 
acter. The volume is handsome, even luxurious, 
in its style. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The Re-vs^riting of American History.* 



It sometimes happens that a historical writer 
lives to find that his efforts have influenced the 
general view of the period or person about whom 
he writes ; but not so frequently does an author 
announce his intention of reconstructing public 
opinion about a period of history so hackneyed 
as is the American Revolution. Mr. Sidney 
George Fisher, a member of the Philadelphia 
bar, who has hitherto set several lances against

accepted opinions in his various " true " con- 
tributions to American history, now devotes 
himself to the task of amending all existing his- 
tories of the Revolution, which are " able theat- 
rical efforts, enlarged Fourth of July orations, 
or pleasing literary essays on selected phases of 
the contest." 

Assuming that " no complete history of it 
[the struggle for Independence] has ever been 
written upon the plan of dealing frankly with 
all the contemporary evidence and withholding 
nothing of importance that is found in the 
original records," and that some of the most 
important factors in the struggle " have always 
been left to persons who were unable or unwil- 
ling to reveal them," the author proceeds to lift 
the veil upon the hitherto obscure position of the 
Loyalists and their conflict with the Patriots, 
the war made by the latter upon the former, 
the controversy caused by Howe's manner of 
carrying out his instructions, and the Clinton- 
Corn wallis controversy. 

He also finds no intelligent history of the 
various Navigation acts, the Smuggling acts, 
and the Writs of Assistance, — whether the 
writs ceased after American resistance, or were 
continued in the other colonies. The effect of 
the revolt on British colonial policy he finds in- 
adequately treated, as also the lessons learned 
by the mother country. The Tory party has 
hitherto been pictured as an angel of darkness, 
and the Whig as an angel of light. No historian 
has described the twelve or thirteen acts which 
the colonists wished repealed, the conciliatory 
measures advanced by Britain, and her " gentle 
and mild efforts " to persuade the Americans to 
remain in the empire. While " Bancroft's labo- 
rious pages and Hildreth's colorless chronicle" 
are illuminated by " a very few citations, and 
these rather unimportant," Fiske's "beautifully 
written " books are devoid of these aids to the 
reader in weighing the evidence submitted. Ar- 
raigning existing histories of the Revolution as 
" written for profit, ignoring the sources, with- 
holding evidence," and ignoring the fact that the 
revolt was the result of a " long uncertain strug- 
gle between the two opposing forces of colonial 
empire and separate independence " still existent, 
the author defines his " true " historical series, 
of which this volume is to be a part, as an effort 
to lead the reader back to the documentary CAa- 
dence which constitutes the truth, so that the 
rising generation may learn to admire truth 
more than popular and clever generalizations. 

Agreeable to these claims and this announce- 
ment, the reader naturally looks in Mr. Fisher's 



pages for much new evidence, and expects to 
see many new sources there revealed. In this, 
however, he is likely to be disappointed. A 
glance through the footnotes shows constant 
repetition of use of the American Archives, the 
Annual Register, and the Journal of the Con- 
tinental Congress ; of the works of Hutchinson, 
Niles, Stedman, Elliot, Jones, Drake, and the 
plagiaristic Gordon ; and also the writings of 
Washington, the Adamses, Reed, and others — 
sources used by every writer upon the period. 
Apparently the novelty of sources must lie in 
the contemporary pamphlets, which have been 
freely consulted and often with excellent effect. 
Notwithstanding the avowed intention of the 
author to revise accepted history, the reader 
finds that in but few instances is there a depart- 
ure from accepted opinions. Even the varia- 
tions are statements of the view of the author 
rather than the discovery of some hitherto 
unused authority. To illustrate : instead of 
treating the Boston Tea Party as a spontaneous 
outbreak of some turbulent young-bloods of the 
lower social class, or a desperate effort on the 
part of the patriot leaders to prevent the tea 
being landed and confiscated at the expiration 
of twenty days, the author pronounces it a delib- 
erate attempt of the radicals of Boston, incited 
by messages from Philadelphia (!), to precipi- 
tate " an outbreak which would commit the 
party all over the country to a more violent and 
radical position." 

The narrative opens with a description of the 
Navigation acts, prefaced by a chapter on the 
growth of free thought and movement after 
the Reformation, and closes with the disbanding 
of the American forces after the Revolutionary 
War. An added chapter discusses one of the 
points claimed to have been omitted by prior 
writers. In it the author finds that England 
retrieved commercially the loss of the thirteen 
American colonies by the conquest of rich 
India, but that she has not in the further ex- 
tension of her colonial system ameliorated the 
conditions which caused the American colonies 
to revolt. All her colonists are still " political 
slaves." 

Descriptions of campaigns fill most of the two 
volumes, discovering little in novelty of state- 
ment or setting, but giving more than the 
accustomed space to incidents of the by- wars 
of England with France, Spain, and Holland. 
Balance and proportion are well preserved, 
except where local interest is permitted to pre- 
dominate, as in giving an entire chapter to the 
mediaeval tourney held by the British officers in

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



Mr. Ellis's book is an attempt to interpret 
the genius of the Spanish people, as it is re- 
vealed in history, in religion, in literature, and 
in daily life. There is no descriptive writing, 
no record of personal experience, no discussion 
of political, industrial, or commercial conditions, 
but a thoughtful analysis of the " essential 
Spain," which, he says, — 

"Represents the supreme manifestation of a certain 
primitive and eternal attitude of the human spirit, an 
attitude of heroic energy, of spiritual exaltation, directed 
not chiefly toward comfort or gain, but toward the more 
fundamental facts of human existence." 

There is perhaps little that is new in the book, 
yet the discussion, being philosophical and sug- 
gestive, forms interesting reading. The follow- 
ing sentence illustrates the general content as 
well as the style of composition. 

" The people of Spain — still sound at the core, and 
with a vigour of spirit which has enabled them to win 
strength even out of defeat — showed at one period at 
least in their history, from the conquest of Toledo to 
the conquest of Seville, an incomparable strength, free- 
dom, and vitality ; even later, Spain still had the energy 
to find and to colonise the other hemisphere of the globe ; 
and later still, to bring spiritual achievements of im- 
mortal value to the treasure-house of humanity; while 
the forceful and plastic genius of Spain has moulded 
one of the strongest and most beautiful forms of human 
speech and one of the most widely diffused." 

Throughout his study of Spanish traits and 
temperament, Mr. Ellis finds much African 
influence. He sees everywhere the underlying 
characteristics of the primitive savage — the 
word to be used in its larger sense. Thus, the 
simplicity, intensity of feeling, and love of idle- 
ness of the Spaniard, coupled with his aptitude 
for violent action, his austerity, his stoicism, his 
indifference to pain, as well as his delight in 
form and ceremony, are all manifestations of the 
aboriginal spirit. A general survey of Spanish 
life to-day and in the past shows that the ideals 
of valor and of heroism, the point of honor, 
the pride of the beggar, ceremonialism, mili- 
tarianism, the Inquisition, the bull-fight, the 
Dominican order, the Cid, Loyola, Cervantes, — 
indeed, nearly every characteristic usually sup- 
posed to be Spanish, as well as the principal 
institutions and personages of Spain, have 
their fountain-head in the elemental aborigine. 
Whether this is our old friend Probably Ar- 
boreal, or not, is unstated. 

The Spanish woman receives kindly treat- 
ment in Mr. Ellis's hands. He studies her ana- 
tomically and otherwise with painstaking care. 
Full consideration is given to the pigmentation 
of her eye, the texture of her skin, her hair, 
hands, feet, bust, and hips, without omitting the 



length of her skull or the peculiar curve of her 
spine. Her dash of eastern blood is responsible 
for the calm steadiness of her eye, as well as for 
the muscular control of her face which renders 
it a living shield. And this explains what has 
always been a mystery to us of northern race, her 
seeming composure under the blazing mirada 
or " long gaze " of the courteous Spaniard. 
The Spanish woman has reached high eminence 
in literature, in war, in movements for social 
reform, and even in the bull-ring. She may be 
unable, it is true, to read or to write. 

" But there is perhaps no European country where 
one realizes so clearly how little this really means. A 
Spanish woman of the people, who finds it a laborious 
task to write her own name, may yet show the finest tact 
and knowledge in all the essential matters of living." 

Mr. Ellis finds the women of present-day 
Spain superior to the men, both physically and 
intellectually. Far be it from the reviewer to 
take issue with this conclusion, yet he cannot 
quite follow the author's reasoning when he 
accounts for this phenomenon by the sad deple- 
tion of Spanish manhood through wars, the 
Inquisition, and emigration to the New World. 
" We might explain the fine qualities of Spanish women 
to-day by supposing that, while the stocks that especially 
tend to produce fine men have been largely killed out, 
the stocks that tend to produce fine women have not 
been subjected to this process." 

Just what kind of stock it is that produces fine 
women while leaving their brothers weak, the 
author does not say. 

Looking at the country as a whole, Mr. Ellis 
notes remarkable progress in cities and towns 
during the last two decades. Spain even stands 
ahead of most European states in the application 
of electricity. Discontent with the old order 
and zeal for the new have resulted, however, in 
the loss of many picturesque features which 
heretofore have constituted Spain's charm for 
the foreign visitor. There is no complaint at 
the betterment of hotels, the improvements in 
sanitation, or the increased facilities for travel ; 
but there is genuine regret at seeing fine old 
churches used as convenient attachments for 
electric wires, and the talking-machine, or 
cinematograph, replacing the guitar and the 
malaguena. 

That there is also a certain moral awaken- 
ing in Spain is shown by the recent movement 
to eliminate the most objectionable features 
of the buU-fighfc. This has been approved by 
prominent espadas — Mr. Ellis caUs them 
" toreadors." 

It may surprise Americans to read that our 
war with Spain and her consequent disburden-

ment of Cuba and the Philippines are the 
cause of much of her later development. In 
the author's words : 

" The war has been beneficial [to Spain] in at least 
two different ways. It has had a healthy economical 
influence, because, besides directing the manhood of 
Spain into sober industrial channels, it has led to the 
removal of artificial restrictions in the path of com- 
mercial activity. It has been advantageous morally, 
because it has forced even the most narrow and ignorant 
Spaniard to face the actual facts of the modern world." 

The Introduction to " The Soul of Spain," 
together with the chapters on " The Spanish 
People," " The Women of Spain," and " Spanish 
Ideals of To-day," contain all the matter that 
properly falls under the title of the book. 
The chapters treating of Seville, Don Quixote, 
Valera, Ramon Lull, and other disconnected 
subjects, are evident padding. Much of the 
matter has appeared previously in reviews and 
magazines. 

While Mr. Ellis's book is useful for the 
library, Mr. Lomas's, as its title " In Spain " 
might imply, is serviceable on the spot. With 
true English assurance, the author expresses the 
belief that the traveller " may take it in his hand 
as his sole guide and counsellor, and find in it 
all the information, other than that of local and 
ever- varying character, which he will need in his 
journeyings." The work is, indeed, a revised, 
re-written, and enlarged edition of the author's 
" Sketches in Spain," published in 1884. It is 
a fine book mechanically, containing a good fold- 
ing map and fifty excellent mostly new full-page 
photographs. The showy red cover is stamped 
with the arms of Spain in Spanish yellow. 

The style of writing is uninspired, to say the 
least ; while the great mass of detailed informa- 
tion, the result of careful observation and con- 
scientious record, produces a guide-book effect 
which is not attractive to the general reader. It 
is really a guide-book — a sort of Baedeker, with 
light clothes covering the dry bones of that pro- 
saic but useful work. Mr. Lomas tells us the 
proper train to take, where to obtain the best view, 
what to visit, and when. He names the pictures, 
describes the chapels, altars, pulpits, and tombs, 
and points out which window to study. To 
many there will seem to be an overweight of 
ecclesiastical architecture ; for if the churches 
were omitted, the book would probably be re- 
duced a third in size. Although the principal 
Spanish paintings are designated, the criticism 
of them is too general and too fragmentary to 
be valuable or satisfying. 

The chapters are arranged in the form of an 



itinerary, beginning at Irun, proceeding south- 
ward by way of Burgos, Valladolid, and Sala- 
manca, to Madrid, thence through the cities of 
Andalucia to Gibraltar, and back by Granada 
and the Mediterranean coast to Barcelona. 
Northern Spain is then crossed, visiting the 
principal towns to Vigo, where the trip ends. 
This tour occupies about six months, starting at 
the close of October, wandering through the 
south in the winter months, taking the Mediter- 
ranean in early spring, and sailing away before 
hot weather begins. It is a long trip, yet not 
a leisurely one. Let no man imagine, if he goes 
with Mr. Lomas, that he is to sit at little cafe, 
tables and watch the life drift lazily by. Every 
day is a busy day, although perhaps hot a hard 
one. The traditional hardships of Spanish travel 
are thus dismissed: 

" Every needful comfort, and, indeed, not a little 
luxury and up-to-date fruits of science, will be met with ; 
and if, here and there, something be lacking, there will 
be shown such an amount of goodwill and helpfulness, 
such honesty and laborious striving to make up for de- 
fects, that the want will call only for a laugh." 

Like most writers on Spain, Mr. Lomas has 
not been able to refrain from depicting a bull- 
fight, although he is mercifully brief, remember- 
ing possibly that we have heard it all many 
times before. We find nothing new in his ac- 
count except the novel statements that chulos 
carry " red flags," and that the matador uses a 
" short Toledo blade." 

In common with Mr. Ellis, the author per- 
ceives a great advancement in Spain during the 
last twenty-five years. He says : 

" It has become possible to pass and to uphold laws 
ensuring security of life and property. The almost un- 
unrivalled natural resources of the country are being 
rapidly developed; liberal institutions are being set on 
foot ; the national indebtedness has shrunk into manage- 
able proportions, and the foreign creditor is content. 
Notable efforts are being made to free the land from 
the tyranny of priestcraft." 

Both of these volumes are substantial addi- 
tions to our rapidly growing stock of books 
descriptive of this interesting country. " The 
Soul of Spain " will be enjoyed at home by the 
man who is interested in the history and psy- 
chology of nations, even though he may not 
subscribe to the savage or superiority-of -woman 
theories. " In Spain " will be most helpful to 
the traveller, and more especially to the anti- 
quarian or the ecclesiologist. Neither book has 
any special message for the idle or purposeless 
traveller. Not much consideration can be shown 
the " nimble tourist " by men who devote a week 
to Toledo. George Griffin Brownell.

The DEVEiiOPMBNT OF English 
Tragedy.* 



In tracing the course and development of 
English tragedy, Professor Thorndike first ex- 
plains the meaning and scope of the term, and 
of the two principal ideas — the Senecan and 
the Mediasval — which enter into it. He then 
shows how these two elements fused in early 
English tragedy, and how the resultant English 
form developed and reached its height in the 
hands of Marlowe and Shakespeare ; how the 
evolution proceeded, under the less wholesome 
conditions of English life in the times of 
James I. and Charles I., in the work of the 
later Elizabethans and especially Beaumont 
and Fletcher ; how this somewhat hectic and 
unwholesome English literary tradition, as it 
existed at the closing of the theatres in 1642, 
was carried on at the Restoration ; how French 
pseudo-classic influence steadily worked upon 
this English tradition for a century, — the con- 
flict between pure English tragical tradition and 
the pseudo-classic being shown in the work 
of Dryden, Lee, and others, — until out of the 
two was established a highly conventionalized 
stereotyped form which was the recognized 
legitimate tragedy of the eighteenth century, 
and extended over into the nineteenth. He 
points out the elements of revolt from this con- 
ventionalized type in Lillo's " George Barnwell " 
and in the practise of the writers of the romantic 
movement so far as they turned to tragedy. But 
these elements of revolt came to naught, and this 
history of the tragic type comes to an end with 
the retirement of Macready from the manage- 
ment of Drury Lane in 1843. 

Professor Thorndike is quite right in attri- 
buting to the theatrical conditions of the time 
much of the responsibility for the failure of the 
great poetical romantic movement of 1790-1832 
to produce tragedy. The two patent theatres 
which alone had the right to produce tragedies 
were overstocked with older plays, and in gen- 
eral were moribund. Opportunity and incen- 
tive for the great poets to learn the jieeds of the 
theatre, and to adapt their conceptions to the 
requirements of actual performance, were lack- 
ing. The poets wrote dramas which, however 
brilliant in composition, were not actable, and 
thus arose a closet drama of great literary merit. 
To the lover of true drama, these closet dramas 
are a sad memorial of what might have been. 

• Tragedy. By Ashley H. Thorndike, Professor of English 
in Columbia University. Boston : Houghton Mifflin Co. 



One cannot but think that some of these men 
could have met both demands — could have 
written plays which were good for the stage 
and good as literature ; and thus the long con- 
tinued separation between literature and the 
stage might have been avoided. 

Professor Thorndike's book is the third to 
appear in Professor Neilson's series of histories 
of English literature by types, following " The 
Popular Ballad " by Prof. F. B. Gummere and 
" The Literature of Roguery " by Mr. F. W. 
Chandler. One may have some doubts as to the 
practicability of treating all English literature 
on this plan, but Professor Thorndike has demon- 
strated that tragedy may be so treated to advan- 
tage. He has traced the development of tragedy 
skilfully, and has held firmly to the idea of its 
evolution as a species. Except, perhaps, for the 
chapter of fifteen pages on Shakespeare, he has 
not deviated from his purpose. The species is 
his interest, not the individual ; and, with the 
single exception noted above, individuals are 
treated as stages of the developing species, not 
in a series of individual essays as in Ward's 
" English Dramatic Literature." 

The interest of the book consists in its han- 
dling of familiar matter from this unifying point 
of view, rather than in its contribution of new 
facts to scholarship ; although it is but fair to 
say that Professor Thorndike has had to work 
almost from the ground up in the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries, and that his book is dis- 
tinctly a contribution to our knowledge of this 
period. On the whole, he is to be congratulated 
on the accomplishment of a piece of sound 
scholarly work. q ^ HATaAWAY, Jb. 



A Guide to the Study of the 
Philippines.* 



The volume of " Bibliography of the Philip- 
pine Islands '' is issued as a part of the extended 
series on " The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898," 
and a small edition of it is also issued as a sep- 
arate publication. The text proper of the series 
— i. e., its historical documents — ended with 
Volume 62, and the two remaining volumes of 
the fifty-five are to be given to an analytical 
index. 

The series as a whole is a monument to the 
imtiring devotion of the editors, Mr. James A.

Robertson and Miss Emma Helen Blair. They 
have accomplished their task amid many un- 
toward circumstances. Not long after the first 
volumes of the series had appeared, in 1903, it 
became apparent that there was not yet sufficient 
interest in the past of the Philippines to furnish 
the financial support necessary for a work of this 
magnitude. But the publishers, facing the loss, 
stood by the editors in the determination to carry 
out their undertaking. And the latter have kept 
at the task while for five years their only hope 
of reward lay in the recognition of work well 
done. Forced to a strict economy in the prose- 
cution of their enterprise, they have at the same 
time been obliged to enlarge their personal activ- 
ities as editors and producers of material, while 
also burdened with the drudgery of the merely 
clerical labors which such a work involves. 
Scholarly fidelity of this sort deserves mention ; 
and this is the excuse for a digression at the very 
beginning of this review. The series of which 
this Bibliography forms a part is not without its 
defective features, failures of omission chiefly; 
it is doubtless not as good as its own editors 
could have made it with better support and more 
substantial encouragement. But it is neverthe- 
less a work of great significance and value — the 
most important achievement in its field, and 
indispensable in any Philippine library or col- 
lection. 

This Bibliography is one more proof of the 
care and conscientiousness that have gone into 
the editing of the work as a whole ; and like- 
wise it gives evidence of the knowledge accu- 
mulated during the preparation of the preceding 
volumes. Passing over, for the moment, the 
discussion of its scope, it may be said that, 
within the limits which he outlined for himself, 
Mr. Robertson's work is both thorough and 
accurate. Down to the special index of names 
which closes the volume, painstaking attention 
to detail is everywhere apparent. 

After stating the purposes and limitations of 
the volume, Mr. Robertson gives some fifty pages 
of usefully condensed information regarding the 
chief public and private collections of Philippine 
manuscripts and printed works in the world ; 
also regarding Philippine Imguistics, maps and 
cartography, photographs and views, museum 
collections, etc. The collections of manuscripts 
in Spain occupy, of course, preferential import- 
ance of space ; and owing to the special value 
of the Seville archives for Philippine history, a 
dozen pages are taken up with the indexes of 
Philippine documents there preserved. Only 



lately. Professor H. E. Bolton, investigating the 
national archives in Mexico City, turned up a 
lot of suspected but hitherto unlisted material 
on the Philippines ; and the scope of that material 
is here indicated. The information as to the 
chief collections of Philippina in the United 
States is of direct practical value to any Amer- 
ican student who may take up serious work in 
this hitherto neglected field. 

Only a fourth of the bibliographical text pro- 
per is devoted to printed works. First comes a 
list of the major Philippine bibliographies, with 
some very practical and pertinent commentaries 
thereon, — the list also including various minor 
works in Philippine bibliography and special 
bibliographical lists, even also notes of rectifica- 
tion in periodicals as well as pamphlets and 
books. There follows a list of other bibliog- 
raphies mostly general in their nature, under 
which the Philippines or some phase of them 
are treated ; also catalogues of public and pri- 
vate libraries and sales catalogues listing Philip- 
pina. This list, and the one following it, covering 
books and pamphlets on the Philippines which 
append bibliographies or contain bibliograph- 
ical data scattered through their text, possess a 
reference value quite imique, as the information 
is nowhere else available. The last and largest 
list of printed titles is the only one that falls 
under the head of General Bibliography. It 
is comprised almost entirely of printed books, 
pamphlets, etc., which have been published in 
whole or in part in the preceding fifty-two vol- 
umes of "The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898," 
with the addition of some few very rare works 
which have not been drawn upon directly for 
that work. The special value of this list lies 
in the descriptions, location of copies so far as 
known, and other data regarding the rarer 
works on the Philippines. 

The bulk of the volume is devoted to manu- 
scripts. Here the first hundred pages are 
occupied with a chronological list of the manu- 
scripts published in whole or in part in the 
series of which this Bibliography is a part. 
Very complete descriptions, especially of the 
more important of these manuscripts, are also 
afforded. In the second and larger list oi 
manuscripts, those not published in the series, 
descriptions are sometimes appended, and some- 
tiaies not. Some of these manuscripts have 
been cited from other Philippine bibliographers 
and authors, who have not always described or 
located them. The memoranda made in various 
archives for this work in many cases give only

the dates and a general idea of the character of 
the manuscripts that have not been transcribed. 
Moreover, the work was originally planned to 
cover Philippine history only up to 1800, which 
is one reason for there being relatively fewer 
manuscripts of the nineteenth century. How- 
ever, the Ayer Collection in Chicago and the 
manuscripts in the Library of Congress, these 
latter relating mainly to Guam, have helped in 
part to fill the hiatus here ; and full descriptions 
are also given of manuscripts in these two libra- 
ries. Of course, one volume could not begin to 
hold a complete list of manuscripts about the 
Philippines ; nor has the time come when any- 
one coidd make such a catalogue. Even the 
better-known collections of such manuscripts 
in the archives of Spain have not yet been 
thoroughly overhaided ; while the archives of 
Manila and those at Mexico City — to mention 
two highly important soiu-ces for the future 
study of Philippine history — remain as yet 
uncatalogued, and the latter scarcely examined. 
But this volume presents, as stated in the in- 
troduction, " more manuscript Philippine titles 
than all other bibliographies together " — many 
more, in fact. Moreover, " manuscripts are cited 
for almost each year of the Spanish regime; 
and thus the manuscript division forms in itself 
almost an epitome of Philippine history." 

Mr. Robertson, then, has not undertaken to 
prepare a full comprehensive bibliography of 
the Philippines. Such a work could not be com- 
prised in any one octavo volume. This opening 
still exists, for none of the Philippine biblio- 
graphies previously published has fully covered 
the field, even of printed titles. Retana's recent 
Aparato hihliogrdjico lists more titles than any 
other, and is usef id in many ways ; but the most 
practical working bibliography, especially for 
the American student, is that formed of the two 
lists of Mr. A. P. C. Griffin (Library of Con- 
gress) and Mr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera, both 
published in one volume by the Bureau of 
Insular Affairs of the War Department at 
Washington. This work being readily avail- 
able, Mr. Robertson's purpose has been, as 
regards printed PhUippina, to point out the 
sources for a complete study of Philippine bib- 
liography, while also setting forth the main 
data regarding rare works in this field ; and to 
list manuscripts in a way hitherto unattempted. 
This task, well performed, makes a work sui 
generis and indispensable for every library pre- 
tending to cover this field at all and for every 
special student therein.

Why are we ^^^ ^^^^t of all evil, in Dr. George 
rtghthanded M. Gould's philosophy, is eye-strain. 
or lefthanded f Qp^ ^ ^^^ j^. jggg epigrammatically 

and more truthfully, the eye and its diseases are 
of more far-reaching significance than is commonly 
suspected. In Dr. Gould's book on " Righthanded- 
ness and Lefthandedness " (Lippincott) the eminent 
oculist clearly, and for the first time so far as we 
know, shows the part played by the eye in deter- 
mining which shall be the dominant hand and foot. 
Historically, righthandedness begins with the choice 
of that hand to hold and throw the spear, and of the 
left to carry the shield and protect the vital organs, 
the position of the heart dictating this division of 
duties. Then, the right being the operating hand, 
the right eye is naturally called upon more than 
the left to watch and guide its motions, until, by the 
hereditary transmission of acquired peculiarities (in 
which the author declares himself a believer), the 
right eye, and with it the right hand and foot and ear, 
acquire an almost invariable superiority over their 
mates. In the vaguely groping and sprawling infant 
it is the hereditarily dominant eye, says our oculistr 
author, that decides which hand and foot shall have 
the preference in action ; and with this instinctive 
choice comes also the beginning of that differentia- 
tion in the cerebral hemispheres which makes the 
sinistral " the correlated centre for speech-phonation " 
and also for speech-writing. The exceptions, the 
left-handed — some six per cent of mankind — are 
accounted for by the occasional enforced develop- 
ment of sinistro-expertness because of accident or 
disease ; and this peculiarity, though not commonly 
traceable from father to son, reappears sporadically 
in the race. Grievous is the wrong done to a left- 
handed child in trying to make him over into a 
right-handed one. The speech-centre has become 
located, the left eye has established its superiority, 
and nothing but confusion and eye-strain and all 
sorts of misery can result. The book's eight chap- 
ters, two of which are reprinted from " Biographic 
Clinics," and the others collected from medical and 
scientific journals, treat chiefly of writing and the 
writing-posture in relation to the eyes and to spinal 
curvature, with useful advice and information in 
other kindred matters. The author's preliminary 
list of previous theories as to the origin of right- 
handedness omits the shield-and-spear explanation, 
as if it were here advanced for the first time, which 
of course it is not. The eye's leading part in the fix- 
ing of righthandedness or lefthandedness is proved, 
in some sort at least, by embryology. 

It is a curious point — upon which 
only Doctor Johnson could make the 
adequate gibe — that not only is a 
Shakespearean editor required to determine what 
plays may rightfully be attributed to the master, 
but in collecting the plays wrongfully attributed to 
Shakespeare the apocryphal editor must exercise a

similar care and shut out of his volume those plays 
that have not often enough been wrongly attributed ! 
Some two-score plays have had the dangerous honor 
of being assigned to Shakespeare ; but fourteen of 
these, in the editor's opinion, may legitimately find 
place in " The Shakespeare Apocrypha," a volume 
carefully put together by Mr. C. F. Tucker Brooke, 
a Rhodes Scholar who is at present Senior Demy 
of Magdalen College, and which is issued from the 
Oxford Press. Mr. Brooke's collection meets a defi- 
nite need. Many a student of Elizabethan drama, 
not to speak of many a reader of Shakespeare, has 
often wished to have ready access to the pseudo- 
Shakespearean dramas, only a few of which, like the 
" Two Noble Kinsmen," have been conveniently at 
hand. To have now in one volume not merely the 
often reprinted plays, but also (in seven instances) 
the first really careful modern reprint, and in one in- 
stance ( " Sir John Oldcastle ") the only reprint of the 
only right version, is a real boon. To name the con- 
tents is to give a sufficient comment on Mr. Brooke's 
volume : Arden of Feversham, Locrine, Edward III., 
Mucedorus, Sir John Oldcastle, Thomas Lord Crom- 
well, The London Prodigal, The Puritan, A York- 
shire Tragedy, The Merry Devil of Edmonton, Fair 
Em, Two Noble Kinsmen, The Birth of Merlin, Sir 
Thomas More. Of these plays Mr. Brooke gives us 
a careful text in the old spelling, and adds a well- 
written fifty-page introduction and some notes. It 
is unfortunate that the notes are so scanty : herein 
the volume fails of being definitive. It is to be hoped 
that in a future edition the editor will add copiously 
to his annotations, and thus make hia book indis- 
pensable. When so much has been well done, it 
is a pity not to do the needful rest and make the 
work completely satisfying. Regarding the plays 
rejected, there is no need to quarrel with the editor's 
taste : as in an anthology, both rejection and inclu- 
sion are extremely provocative of dissent in some 
quarter or another. Mr. Brooke has, at the very 
least, made a good choice of plays. 

The "psychic Anyone who has perused M. Flam- 
researches " of marion's writings upon procedures 
an astronomer, seemingly at variance with the recog- 
nized laws of nature will anticipate that there is 
nothing notable to be found in the more extended 
work lately appearing in English with the title 
"Mysterious Psychic Forces" (Small, Maynard & 
Co.). The book is, indeed, a compilation, with re- 
cent additions, of a long record of seances with 
" mediums " of all sorts and conditions, whose chief 
occupation is that of moving tables and " material- 
izing " theatrical properties in a more or less baffling 
manner. Upon such narratives a rather extreme 
" spiritualistic" interpretation is elaborated. To one 
convinced of the soundness of this position, or one 
inclined to such belief, the collected data must be 
tremendously portentous. To one who expects that 
investigations emanating from a man with astronom- 
ical training would be marked by the qualities we 
should naturally look for from such a source — 



exactness of conditions, laborious accumulation of 
evidence, expertness in detecting sources of error, 
and caution in conclusions — the record will be 
equally disappointing. The author assumes at the 
outset of his studies a definiteness of attitude and 
confidence of elimination of sources of error which 
he would not assume at the close of a long astro- 
nomical research. M. Flammarion is, indeed, the 
conspicuous example of a man of science utterly con- 
fused, even dazed, by the overpowering dominance 
of " facts "; quite ilnmindful that the type of " fact " 
that thus staggers his reason but reflects the manner 
of his predilections. Had he really described facts, 
the record would have been brief : " In the presence 
of such and such a medium, I have apparently 
observed such and such behavior of inanimate ob- 
jects. I did not succeed in discovering how the 
effect was produced." Just what the interest or the 
interpretation of the alleged phenomena may prove 
to be, when their modus operandi is frankly con- 
fessed, is still left to uncertainty.

Arthur Christopher Benson has en- 
titled his latest book "The Schoolmaster " (Putnam). 
However, he has scarcely anything to say on the 
subject of classical education, his pleasantly informal 
chapters having to do with the general relations be- 
tween masters and pupils and between the master 
and his colleagues, with brief dissertations on such 
subjects as holidays, sociability, religion, moralities, 
intellect, originality, praise, discipline, devotion, and 
a few more of like sort ; and so it need not be feared 
that he has stolen any of the excellent Ascham's 
thunder. The book is announced as a companion 
volume to the author's " Upton Letters," and it serves 
as an acceptable sequel and complement to that 
thoughtful and stimulating work. It has also some- 
thing more of definiteness and reality and terseness 
than that series of imaginary letters, admirable and 
" convincing " though those letters are. As a sample 
of the later book's quality, let us quote a few lines 
that might well be pondered, not only by school- 
masters, but also by others, perhaps by book-reviewers. 
"One form of affectation has, I believe, very bad 
results. It is the custom of many teachers to speak 
as if all the authors whom they were expounding 
were equally valuable. I do not think that anything 
destroys the critical and appreciative faculties in boys 
so quickly as this. I believe myself that it is good 
for a teacher to have strong prejudices, just as Dr. 
Arnold's feeling for Livy partook, as his pupils said, 
of an almost personal animosity." The writer takes 
occasion to deplore the present excessive devotion to 
athletics in school and university, a protest rendered 
the more effective from his own record as a football- 
player. Like many who write much and easily, Mr. 
Benson has his mannerisms, among which one can- 
not but note his fondness for the word "apt" to 
denote customary action, a usage of questionable cor- 
rectness, but pardonable if not carried to excess.

THE DIAL 



[Sept. 1, 



, ^ , , In the middle ages, and long before, 

About peacocks, j i 

flowers, aardens, the peacock was regarded as a sym- 
and other things, bol of eternity, of immortality. Thus 
we are informed in the preface to " The Peacock's 
Pleasaunce" (Lane) — a collection of graceful, al- 
most poetical, essays on themes chiefly rural, and 
having to do largely with birds and gardens and 
flowers, and also weeds, while two addresses on art 
education complete the volume. The book is by 
"E. V. B." (in quotation marks), who is apparently 
a woman, and one of fine sensibilities, mystical in 
her moods and given to symbolism in their literary 
expression. In the semi-suggestions of the super- 
natural that sprinkle her pages, as well as in the veil 
of mysticism thrown over all, there is something 
almost Hawthornesque — a nameless charm that 
makes one forgive the " fine writing " in which the 
author is prone to indulge. Let us quote one short 
passage which, with many others, falls on the ear 
with more than a faint reminder of Hawthorne. The 
Professor's daughter has seen a startlingly strange 
insect, and the Professor says : " ' Call me should 
the thing reenter the house. I will immediately 
come, and will straightway bottle him ; or I will con- 
strain him weightily between the leaves, within the 
covers of one of my biggest books.* Having thus 
spoken, the Professor retreated into his study, shut- 
ting out the whole of the outside world, immersed, as 
was his wont, for hours in the old, strange world of 
books — - for him more familiar, more illimitable than 
the other." Seven photo-prints of handsome pea- 
cocks, and a fanciful frontispiece also containing 
peacocks, appropriately illustrate the book. 

. Mr. Horace Bleackley's " Story of a 
a famous Beautiful Duchess" (Button) proves 

Irish beauty. ^o be a biography of Elizabeth Gun- 
ning, a famous Irish beauty who became successively 
Duchess of Hamilton and of Argyll, served as one 
of Queen Charlotte's ladies of the bedchamber, and 
was otherwise a person of much social distinction. 
The book presents a very attractive appearance ; the 
binding, presswork, and illustrations do ample justice 
to the elegance of the theme. The story is enter- 
taining and easily read ; it might be objected that 
the author has included a needless amount of petty 
scandal, but it is hard to give a truthful picture of 
English society in the eighteenth century without 
including a certain amount of such material. Still, 
after completing the book the reader is likely to ask 
if the author's efforts have really been worth while. 
No doubt the Duchess was as good and womanly as 
she was beautiful, but she scarcely requires a biog- 
raphy of nearly four hundred pages, which, while it 
adds much to our knowledge of the Duchess, adds 
little to that of her country and age. Aside from a 
tendency to idealize his subject, the author appears 
to possess the qualities of a good historian, which 
might have shown to better advantage in a larger 
field. Some charming portraits of the Duchess, and 
of other notables of her day, add materially to the 
attractiveness of the volume. 



Notes. 



Mr. Mitchell Keuuerley publislies a new edition of 
" Everyman," for which Mr. Montrose J. Moses has pre- 
pared notes, a bibliography, and an elaborate introduction. 

The Oxford edition of Keats, as edited by Mr. H. 
Buxton Forman, is now reissued by Mr. Henry Frowde 
in inexpensive form, with clear type, thin paper, and 
bright red covers. 

A manual of " Elementary Algebra " is one of the 
" Twentieth Century Text-Books " of the Messrs. Apple- 
ton. It is the joint work of Professor J. W. A. Young 
and Lambert L. Jackson. 

Two new volumes in " Lippincott's Educational 
Series " are the following: " The Educational Process," 
by Mr. Arthur Gary Fleshman, and " The Study of 
Nature," by Dr. Samuel Christian Schmucker. 

The John Lane Co. publish an illustrated edition of 
the play " Beau Brummel," as written for the late 
Richard Mansfield by Mr. Clyde Fitch. A portrait of 
the actor and several other illustrations adorn the 
volume. 

" A Dictionary of English Literature," by Mr. M. 
McCroben, is published by the Messrs. Routledge (New 
York: Dutton) in their " Miniature Reference Library." 
It is a dictionary of English authors only, with lists of 
their works. 

" A History of Art," by Dr. G. Carotti, revised by 
Mrs. Arthur Strong, is pubhshed by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. It is a compact volume with many 
miniature illustrations, and is devoted to ancient art 
alone. Presumably one or more volumes upon modem 
art will follow. 

The Macmillan Co. send us a new edition (the forty- 
first), entirely revised and greatly enlarged, of William 
James's " Dictionary of the English and German Lan- 
guages." Both vocabularies are included in a single 
volume of over eleven hundred pages. It«make8 a 
compact and inexpensive work, and, as such, is to be 
highly commended. 

A collection of " The Peasant Songs of Great Russia," 
collected and transcribed from phonograms by Miss 
Eugenie Lineff, is published by the Imperial Academy 
of Science at St. Petersburg. The text is in both 
Russian and English. Mr. David Nutt is the agent in 
England and America for this pubHcation, the present 
issue being the first of a series. 

Mr. George P. Upton's "The Standard Concert 
Guide" (McClurg) is a condensation of the three vol- 
umes devoted respectively to oratorios, cantatas, and 
symphonies, that have long been in favor with concert- 
goers. Enough new matter has been added to bring 
the work down to date, and some sixty portraits of 
composers embellish the volume. 

We are glad to note, as a sign of returnmg pros- 
perity in the book trade, that the New York branch 
of the old established house of Cassell & Co., which of 
late years has existed chiefly as an agency of the London 
house, intends to enter actively into the business of book 
publishing again. Mr. W. B. Hadley is to be the man- 
ager of the New York busmess, which makes a creditable 
showing in its list of books for Fall publication. 

German texts published by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 
are as follows: Rudolf Baumbach's " Der Schwieger- 
sohn," edited by Dr. Otto Heller, and Herr Otto Ernst's 
« Ueberwunden," edited by Dr. James Taft Hatfield. 
From Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. we have " Ratsmadel- 



1908.]

geschichten," by Fraulein Helene Bohlau, edited by Misa 
Emma Haevernick. From the Charles E. Merrill Co. 
we have Goethe's " Hermann und Dorothea," edited by 
Mr. Richard Alexander von Minckwitz. 

Messrs. Walter S. Hinchman and Fi-ancis B. Gum- 
mere have joined forces to produce a volume of suc- 
cinct " Lives of Great English Writers from Chaucer 
to Browning" (Houghton). These biographies, over 
thirty in number, are each from ten to twenty pages in 
length, and give only essential facts, with little or no 
attempt at literary characterization. It is difficult to 
account for some of the omissions, but the work as we 
have it is well done, and students of English literature 
will find it useful. 

L. Mylius Erichsen, the Danish explorer, who met his 
death in a snowstorm while travelling over the ice on 
the northeastern coast of Greenland, as told in a cable- 
gram from Copenhagen a few days ago, was better 
known to his countrymen as an author and poet than 
as an explorer. His best known works are " Tatere " 
(Gypsies), a play; "Vestjyder" (West-Jutlanders), a 
book of short stories; " Strandingshistorier " (Stories of 
Shipwrecks), another book of short stories; " Isglimt " 
(Ice Gleams), a book of poems; "Den jyske Hede" 
(The Jutlandish Heath), a most thorough description 
of that part of Denmark; " Greenland," a record of his 
former explorations in that frozen country. Mr. Erich- 
sen also had the distinction of being the first Danish 
poet to make a serious and intelligent effort to describe 
the actual conditions of the neglected fishermen on the 
west coast of Jutland, and to point out a practical way 
of bettering their condition. Mr. Erichsen was only in 
his thirty-sixth year at the time of his death.

THE LAST VOYAGE OF THE DONNA ISABEL A Sea Story 

By Randall Parrish 

The publishers believe that this is the best story they have yet brought out by Randall Parrish. It is no 
exaggeration to say that it is worthy of a place on the same shelf with the sea romances of Clark Russell 
and Stevenson — so absorbing is the plot and so vivid are the pictures of wild adventure on Antarctic seas. 
The story concerns the search for a lost Spanish galleon which the hero believes to have been buried in 
the ice for over a century. There is plenty of excitement, and Mr. Parrish can be depended upon for a 
delightful love story. 

" A tale that is as fanciful and imaginative as any of Stevenson's romances of the sea. Mr. Parrish 
has charmed hosts of readers with his tales of historic times, but here he appears in a new field, and one 
in which he finds no rival ; for we can think of no other author of recent years who has written a more 
dashingly original tale of the deep than this." — Bookseller, Neivsdealer, and Stationer.

GANTON & CO, A Story of Chicago Commercial and Social Life 

By Arthur Jerome Eddy 

" Ganton & Co." is a big story and a clean story — of sensational interest, but of an entirely legitimate 
sort. It is concerned with matters familiar in Chicago business, industrial, and social life, in which its 
author has himself taken an active part, and hence knows whereof he writes. The characters are types 
easily recognizable, and the chief events and incidents are founded on actual happenings. But all are 
woven into an imaginative story whose power holds the reader from the opening in the modest LaSalle 
street office of " Old Man Ganton," — " whose name meant more to the millions who ate his foods and 
consumed his products than that of any monarch " — to the closing pages where the stern unyielding old 
man yields at last to Death, and " young John " comes into his own. 

With 6 illustrations by Thomas Fogarty. Large 12mo. $1.50. 

WULNOTH THE WANDERER a story of King Alfred of England 

By H. Escott-Inman 

A tale of Viking days which depicts the beginnings of modern England in a manner more real and vivid 
than is permitted to the usual historian. The boy Wulnoth, driven from his native Britain by utter 
cruelty, finds himself arrayed with his country's enemies in the fierce North until he is able to bring his 
courage and capacity to the cause of the good King Alfred. With the rescue of his country, he rescues 
also his own soul, and the book, laden in the early portion with the exultation of war and conquest, con- 
cludes with a spirit of peace and deep content. The volume is issued in the decorative style that distin- 
guished " The Thrall of Leif the Lucky," " For the White Christ," etc., and as the story has a twofold 
appeal, to young readers as well as adults, it should prove a popular gift-book.

HEALTH AND HAPPINESS; or, Religious Therapeutics and Right Living

Bishop Fallows is preeminent among the exponents of the present-day New Thought movement. His new

of the work at St. Paul's Church in Chicago being brought to bear on the discussion itself, and the entire 
work going far to illustrate the intimate connection between the work of the clergyman and that of the 
physician in combating disease. 12mo. Net $1.50; postage, 12 cts.

This work by the motoring editor of the London Sphere is practically free from technical terms, and

"Besides the information about the practical structure, care, and operation of the motor car, and 
descriptions of cars of different makes, which the makers themselves have contributed, Mr. Pemberton's 
book includes valuable chapters on touring abroad, luggage, and motor clubs. The subjects of insurance,

MUSICAL MEMORIES My Recollections of Famous Celebrities, 1850-1900 
By George P. Upton 

Active and aggressive as is music in America in the present day, for the real old timers among music 
lovers it holds no names and achievements like those of the " palmy days " early in the last half of the 
Nineteenth Century. During this entire period Mr. Upton was engaged in active musical criticism in 
Chicago, and had an unusual opportunity to observe what was happening in the musical world. He 
heard all of the great singers, and with many of them he enjoyed an intimate personal acquaintance. In 
tftese recollections he has drawn almost entirely on his own notes, and has made very little use of history 
and biography ; as a result, there is a delightful personal flavor about these reminiscences, a quality of 
kindliness, that makes a rare and genial volume in every sense, and a book of great value for reference. 
Profusely illustrated. Large 8vo, gilt top. Net $2.75; postage, 12 cts. 

THE STANDARD CONCERT GUIDE a Handbook of the standard

practical reference work will be delighted to hear that Mr. Upton's three other similar books, covering 

the standard oratorios, cantatas, and symphonies, are now available in one volume, uniform in size and 

appearance with the new edition of "The Standard Operas." The text has been made as untechnical

Arnold of Winkelried, by Gustav Hocker. Marie Antoinette's Youth, by Heinrich von Lenk.

The exceptional success which has followed the continuation of this series since the first four volumes were 
brought out some years ago has been exceedingly gratifying to the publishers. The original purpose, 
to provide a real children's library, similar to those in Germany, seems to have found literal acceptance, 
and the preparation of additional volumes has been a labor of love to Mr. Upton and a matter of great 
pride to the publishers. Four new volumes, of which the titles are given below, have been added this 
Fall, making twenty in all. Illustrated, 18mo. Each, net 60 cts; postage, 6 cts. 

CLO riLDh By Margaret Bouvet, author of "Sweet William," etc. 

With the old charm of her previous books, Miss Bouvet tells the story of a little French girl in the 
splendid capital of the old Louisiana province. The author is peculiarly at home in depicting French 
character, and little Clotilde, with the color of hair made famous by Titian, her small brother, and the 
proud, beautiful mother, will linger many a day in the fancy of her young readers.

THE FLAMING SWORD And Other Stories of the Earth and Sky

Mrs. Harrison's exquisite fancy has never been seen to better advantage than in this, her newest book. 
It is somewhat different from its predecessors in that she takes as the basis of several of the tales some of 
the prettiest of the Bible stories, to which she gives reverent, though very original interpretations. In 
addition there are a number of her inimitable fairy tales, in which she has embodied all the beautiful 
things in the universe, the stars, birds, flowers, etc. Uniform with Mrs. Harrison's previous successes

Mary Johnston LEWIS RAND 

No American novel yet written presents so vivid a picture of the exciting early years of the last century — of Jefferson 
and Aaron Burr. The rich background of old Virginia, with its stately homes, its beautiful women, and romantic 
ideals, has given Miss Johnston opportunity to tell a moving love story with all the fire and fervor that the readers of 
" To Have and To Hold " so well remember. 

Illustrated in color by F. C. YOHN. Square crown 8vo. $1.50. 

Clara Louise Bumham THE LEAVEN OF LOVE 

The scene of this novel is at one of the famous winter resorts of Southern California, whose radiant health-giving 

sunshine finds a counterpart in the character of the heroine — a girl you are not likely to forget. The book abounds 

in the bright amusing conversations which Mrs. Burnham's readers enjoyed so much in " The Opened Shutters," etc. 

With frontispiece and cover portrait in color by HARRISON FISHER. 12mo. $1.50. 

Oliver Herford and John Cecil Clay CUPID'S ALMANAC

is significant. Crown 8vo. $1.50. 

Robert Seaver YE BUTCHER, YE BAKER, YE CANDLESTICK MAKER

NAPOLEON AND HIS FELLOW TRAVELLERS 

By CLEMENT SHORTER 

With 8 plates. $4.00 net. 

ANEW book on Napoleon can only be justified by the fact that it contains interesting new material or material not 
generally available to the public. In the work entitled " Napoleon and His Fellow Travellers " Mr. Clement Shorter 
has brought together some rare and little-known books that have never been reprinted since their first publication, wellnigh 
a century ago. These include the " Narrative of William Warden," which went through many editions at the time of its 
publication and provoked much criticism. This little book has been edited and annotated with the assistance of Warden's 
grandson, who has placed private documents at the editor's disposal. 

A rare pamphlet, privately printed by Lord Lyttleton, gives an account of interesting conversations with Napoleon on 
board the Northumberland that are known to few students of the epoch. The vivid story of Napoleon's appearance and 
conversation at the time of his surrender, by George Home, in " The Diary of an Aristocrat," a book suppressed on 
publication, also makes attractive reading, as does a little-known letter of Ross, the captain of the Northumberland, on its 
voyage to St. Helena. The whole makes up a dramatic story of one of the most vivid episodes in modern European history, 
told with a freshness that will prove a revelation to the present generation.

In view of the present state of Russia's internal affairs, this 
book by the author of " Napoleon's Love Story," has. inaddi- 
tion to its intrinsic human interest, a profound political signifi- 
cance. As explained in a scathing preface, the work has been 
written from the point of view that such a history as that of 
Russia is an unanswered argument against despotic power. The 
throes of the mighty struggle in Czardom are known to be the 
aftermath of centuries of vice and oppression of her rulers.such as 
it is difficult for the happy inhabitants of free countries to realize.

liant panorama showing the lives of the wealthy and the poor 
in different parts of the world. His pages are more attractive 
and alluring than a novel, for they deal with actualities in the

"9009" 

By JAMES HOPPER and FRED. R. BECHDOLT 

C" 9009 " is the story of the prison life of convict 
John Collins — a powerful, intensely dramatic 
and realistic tale. With absolute truth the incidents 
have been drawn from actual facts, and they form a 
drastic indictment of our prison system that should 
pave the way to needed reforms. As a story the book 
is a masterpiece of direct and forceful fiction.

Barry Gordon 

By WILUAM FARQUHAR PAYSON 

Author of " Dehonnaire," etc. 

CFor straight and unrelieved story-telling Barry 
Gordon is a great success. It is a strongly inter- 
esting romantic-adventure story of modern American 
life whose scenes are laid in the South, in New York, 
Paris, and Morocco. The swift development of fas- 
cinating plot forms a narrative which is thrilling in 

the extreme. ....

Books of Vital and Lasting Interest 



Reminiscences of Carl Schurz 

VOLUME III. READY SHORTLY 

CThe third volume completes this magnificent biography and 
brings Mr. Schurz's life down to its close. General Schurz 
died while this volume was being written, leaving, however, behind 
him a great number of notes intended to assist him in its completion. 
The delicate task of concluding the work from the middle of Grant's 
administration has been successfully undertaken by the historian, 
Francis Bancroft, who enjoyed Mr. Schurz's confidence and to whose 
thoroughly competent hands the voluminous material was intrusted 
by Mr. Schurz's son. 

This third volume, therefore, completes one of the most remark- 
able and most noble lives lived upon Anierican soil.

years ; it is also the record of a distinguished life, of illustrious associations, and of the 
manners and society of a prolific artistic period. 

The importance of the memoirs as a literary accomplishment of exceptional brilliance 
and distinction is an artistic chronicle of broad scope, and as a singularly charming personal 
revelation is unequaled by anything in recent biography. (Ready in November.)

By H. A. MITCHELL KEAYS 

With illastrations by Lester Balph. $1.60. 

Kitty Sargent divorced her playwright husband because she wearied of their struggle with 
poverty. She married again. He brought up their daughter, Christina, " a most distracting 
combination of innocence and cynicism." 

Christina has a boy-and-girl love affair, and to bring home to her the meaning of marriage, 
about which she has ideas of her own, her father sends her to her mother, now for five years a 
widow, and a charming and popular society woman. The result is illuminating. The reader 
marvels at the author's penetration and perception of character, at the divination of feeling and 
the keen, inevitable accuracy of results. A brilliant and satisfying novel of true and tender love.

whom the world believed her lover. Just before the blow falls Diana is betrothed to the man she loves. The subsequent 
story is brilliant with movement and alive with meaning. A novel that thrills and satisfies, because it is passionate, 
beautiful, true. $1.50. 

A SPIRIT IN PRISON 

By ROBERT HICHENS 

In Italy, his power of atmospheric narrative at its best, Mr. Hichens lays this new story. The action takes place on a small 
island in the bay just outside of Naples. Here Hermione is living with her child, Vere, a charming, gracious, childlike girl 
of sixteen. The story opens with a scene which is extremely light and pretty, at the same time portentous. It continues 
to a triumphant end. Illustrated. Cloth. PostSvo. $1.75. 

GILBERT NEAL By will n. harben

THE TOY SHOP 

By MARGARITA SPALDINQ GERRY 

A story of Lincoln — the kind of story that brings a limip 
to the throat and a glimpse of glory to the eyes. There is 
Lincoln visiting a toy-shop in the gloom of a winter even- 
ing to buy tin soldiers for his little son, and talking with 
the old toy-maker, veteran of Napoleon's wars, who uncon- 
sciously wrings the overburdened President's heart with 
tales of his Emperor, who never doubted, never wavered. A 
wonderfully sympathetic study of Lincoln the man — idyllic, 
human, and reverently tender. 
Pictorial Cover in Colors. 16mo. Cloth. 50 cents net. 



EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF 

By NORMAN DUNCAN 

Set in the romantic land of Labrador among the people the 
author knows so well, and eloquent with strong passions, 
these stories are of the order that has set Mr. Duncan's 
name apart in fiction. All of them are intensely romantic, 
some are touched with rare sympathy for children, a few 
have a certain magnificent religrious conviction, such as is 
born in the lives of primitive men, and all are deeply ap- 
pealing in the widest human sense. 

Illustrated. Post 8vo. Cloth. $1.50. 



UNCLE SAM'S BUSINESS

The purpose of this book is to wake young minds to a consciousness of what the government has to do and is doing in the 
service of the people. This book tells how Uncle Sam carries out the orders of his citizens — and this does not mean merely 
political policies, but such activities as mail business and bank business, draining of lands, tests of pure food and poor 
water, and scores of other services for their comfort, convenience, and welfare.

The vein of quiet humor that runs all through the account of this novel wooing is very

note that lends more beauty and charm to the odd little love story than could probably any 
other motif, and the wonders of the great Canadian Northwest are made very real. The

JERUSALEM IN BIBLE TIMES 



An Archaeological Handbook for Travellers and Students, by LEWIS BAYLES PATON. 
Apart from this book there is no treatise on ancient Jerusalem in the English language that represents the present state of scientific

worthless traditions of the particular ecclesiastical bodies with which they happen to be connected.

THE STUDY OF STELLAR EVOLUTION 

An Account of Some Modern Methods of Astrophysical Research, by GEORGE ELLERY HALE. 
The introduction of photographic methods, the improvement of telescopes, and the rapidly increasing appreciation of the value to 
astronomy of physical instruments and processes, have revolutionized the observatory. From a simple observing station it has 
been transformed into a great physical laboratory, where images of the sun and stars are studied with many powerful instruments, 
and celestial phenomena are experimentally imitated with the aid of electric furnaces and other sources of intense heat. The result 
has been a great gain in our knowledge of the origin, development, and decay of stars. This book explains in a popular way how 
the life histories of the sun and stars are investigated. One hundred and four half-tone plates, made from the best astronomical 
negatives, place before the reader the most recent results of celestial photography in most of its phases.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS .... 171 
(A classified list of books announced for publica- 
tion during the coming Fall and Winter season.) 



BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR. 

The classified list of publishers' announce- 
ments, which occupies many pages of our present 
issue, is of rich and varied interest. It seems to 
us to include an unusually large number of attrac- 
tive titles — titles of the sort that whet the liter- 
ary appetite with the foretaste of happy hours in 
the easy-chair. In accordance with our custom, 
we select for note in the present article a few such 
announcements as seem to promise particular 
enjoyment. Only the categories of biography, 
history, and general literature are here touched 
upon, which means, of course, that those readers 
who find their chief account in the literature of 
travel, or of philosophy, or of education, or of 
science or art, are referred to the list itself for 
their special delectation. The list as a whole 
assuredly gives evidence that our publishers look 
forward to a prosperous season, and that the 
commercial depression of last year is becoming 
to them an old, unhappy, far-off thing. 

The category of biography is the richest in 
this year's list. Perhaps the book of first im- 
portance is the life of George William Curtis, 
to which Henry Loomis Nelson gave the best 
energies of the last years of his life. This book 
offers an ideal relation between author and 
subject. Mr. Nelson was not only Curtis's suc- 
cessor in the editorial chair, but he was also a 
man inspired by the same lofty ideals of political 
life and the duty of the citizen. From such a 
writer we may expect a life of Curtis that shall 
be characterized by both sympathy and distinc- 
tion. Mr. H. W. Whitney is the author of a 
new life of Lincoln which is to be a work of 
considerable dimensions. Many other biogra- 
phies of American public men are promised, but 
we must leave them unmentioned. In liter- 
ary biography, Mr. Ferris Greenslet is to give 
us the official life of Thomas Bailey Aldrich, 
based largely upon the letters of the poet. No 
definite promise is thus far given us of a biog- 
raphy of our other lost poet, Edmund Clarence 
Stedman, but his literary executors are hard at 
work upon it, and it may possibly be looked for 
next year. " The Family Letters of Christina 
Rossetti," edited by her brother, are promised ; 
and a volume on William Morris, to be pre- 



156 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



pared by a brother poet, Mr. Alfred Noyes, for 
the " English Men of Letters " series. 

A group of biographical works of extra- 
ordinary interest relates to the world of art, 
music, and the drama. The authorized biog- 
raphy of Whistler is to be the work of Mr. and 
Mrs. Pennell, prepared upon lines laid down by 
Whistler himself, and richly illustrated. Mr. 
Will H. Low, in " A Chronicle of Friendships," 
is to give us his personal reminiscences of such 
men as Millet and Stevenson. The "Musical 
Memories " of Mr. George P. Upton, that veteran 
critic and friend of musicians, will cover a full 
half -century of intimate relations with musicians 
of the past, from Adelina Patti to Theodore 
Thomas. It is sure to be replete with interest 
of the deepest kind. We are also to have a 
translation of Angelo Neumann's " Reminiscen- 
cences of Richard Wagner," one of the most 
important of recent contributions to the life- 
history of the great composer. The two great 
actors who have recently died are to be the sub- 
jects of official memoirs. Mr. Austin Brereton 
is the biographer of Henry Irving, and Mr. 
Paul Wilstach of Richard Mansfield. Both are 
to be large and handsomely-illustrated works. 
Miss Ellen Terry (who is happily not among 
the dead) has written her artistic autobiography 
in the form of a volume of " Recollections and 
Reflections." Finally, our veteran critic of the 
drama, Mr. William Winter, whom we all love 
and respect even if he is crotchetty on the sub- 
ject of most modern developments, is to give us 
in " Other Days " his memories of the vanished 
past of American stage-land. This is a book 
which will parallel in interest Mr. Upton's 
" Musical Memories." 

The historical announcements for this year 
offer rather less than the usual number of books 
of wide general interest. We suppose this is 
because of the prevailing specialization of the 
younger generation of historians. Under this 
head we find little to note save a group of works 
concerned with the history of Canada, a subject 
which is naturally of prime interest in this 
tercentennial year. Mr. Frank B. Tracy is the 
author of " The Tercentenary History of Can- 
ada," and Mr. A. G. Bradley of " The Making 
of Canada." Mr. Charles W. Colby is to give 
us a volume on " Canadian Types of the Old 
Regime," and Mr. Lawrence J. Burpee a his- 
tory of ♦' The Search for the Western Sea." 
These four announcements seem to us the most 
interesting in the department of history, but we 
may add a few others, such as the late Jeremiah 
Curtin's " The Mongols in Russia," Mr. Rupert 



S. Holland's " The BuUders of United Italy," 
the late F. W. Maitland's lectures on "The 
Constitutional History of England," and a 
posthumous volume of " Historical and Political 
Essays " by W. E. H. Lecky. Many important 
historical works now in progress are being car- 
ried on, and new volumes are being added to the 
various series. 

In the field of literary criticism, Mr. Swin- 
burne's long-awaited volume on " The Age of 
Shakespeare " occupies the place of first impor- 
tance. We presume that this will turn out to 
be in large measure a revision of the author's 
long series of studies of individual Elizabethan 
dramatists, contributed during a term of many 
years to the English monthlies. The publica- 
tion of these studies in book form has long been 
desired by students of English literature. In 
literary history, as in political history, most of 
the work is now done by specialists, and takes 
the form of text-books, or additions to series, 
or contributions to such cooperative enterprises 
as the great " Cambridge History of English 
Literature," the third volume of which is soon 
to appear. 

Books that are themselves literature, instead 
of being about literature, are apt to be un- 
heralded, unless they come from authors of 
established fame. We note the promise of 
collections of essays by Mr. S. M. Crothers, Mr. 
Henry van Dyke, Mr. G. K. Chesterton, Mr. 
A. C. Benson, and Mr. Bliss Perry. We note 
a new imaginary conversation, the subject being 
"Justice and Liberty," by that singularly 
polished and thoughtful writer, Mr. G. Lowes 
Dickinson. We note in the drama, " The 
Winter Feast," by Mr. Charles Rann Kennedy, 
"The House of Rimmon," by Mr. Henry van 
Dyke, " Getting Married, and Other Plays," by 
Mr. G. B. Shaw, and the new stage-arrangement 
of "Faust," by Mr. Stephen Phillips. In the 
way of poetry, nothing noticeable is promised, 
but that is the case nearly every year, although 
when the year is ended, we can usually reckon 
up a fairly respectable output. 

Novelists this year are as numerous as ever. 
Almost at a venture, although not wholly with- 
out selective judgment, we will close this sum- 
mary by naming a score of books of fiction — 
about equally divided between the two countries 
— which may confidently be expected to provide 
us with entertainment, and something more in 
most of the cases. Our list is as follows : 
" Helianthus," by " Ouida "; " The Testing of 
Diana Mallory," by Mrs. Humphry Ward ; 
" Wroth," by Mr. and Mrs. Castle ; " The War 



1908.]

this score of books by well-known writers to 
rely upon, to say nothing of hundreds of others

novel should find no lack of occupation during 
the coming year. 



ARNOLD AND LOWELL. 



Hail to the English-speaking Dioscuri of our past 
age ! Chief critics of their time, they really, though 
separated by the seas, fought side by side in the 
fight for the humanities against materialism. Their 
activities were parallel. One roused the quarry up, 
and the other killed it. One lifted up his torch and 
lit the recesses of the jungle, and the other sent his 
arrows in fierce flight amid the herds of its hoofed 
and tusked denizens. 

The literature and art of any generation are the 
surplusage of its life, — what is left over after its 
debts and expenses have been paid. They are the 
fund which is handed on to posterity ; and the great 
critics are the executors, the guardians, the distrib- 
utors of this fund. It is the business of criticism 
to keep clear and distinct the intellectual and spirit- 
ual triumphs of the past, and to spur new minds on 
to emulation of such achievements. But for crit- 
icism, the masterpieces of literature and art would 
be like the buried cities of Yucatan — shapeless 
mounds overgrown with inextricable forest. 

The instincts of both Arnold and Lowell were to 
be builders of temples and cities of their own rather 
than clearers of the rubbish of the past or pathfinders 
and guides to their generation. Possibly their most 
permanent work is in pure art — the expression 
of emotion, or greatness, or beauty ; but the world 
found them so useful as critics that it kept them at 
that less congenial business. They had the blood of 
kings in them, but their contemporaries insisted on 
placing them in the seats of judges. 

In criticism, Lowell is more the preserver of the 



Past ; Arnold, more the originator, the innovator, 
in the Present. Lowell's essays were a little old- 
fashioned even when they were born ; but, like many 
old-fashioned things, they have a richness and sim- 
plicity that will outlast novelties. His papers have 
a fulness, an extracted blend of thinking, which 
makes us recur to them again and again. Scattered 
over them are passages whose diction is of weightier 
metal than anything in Arnold. Arnold is alert, 
striking, even startling. He has a new analysis. 
His ideas open up vistas where before was gloom. 
His phrases are the keenest and handiest of critical 
weapons. Perhaps they were so deft and easy of 
use that their edges have become a little dulled. 
Often, too, they had an air of finality about them — 
and finalities are always half-truths at best. 

Both critics have their days of languor, their 
list of failures. Lowell's cleverness often became 
smartness, and Arnold's fastidiousness frequently 
landed him in strange company. Lowell was too 
uncertain in his judgments, and Arnold too oracular. 
Lowell was of two minds about Dryden, and a dozen 
about Pope ; and his essay on Keats is as unsatis- 
factory as that of Arnold on Shelley. Both men, 
however, illustrated the truth that the best criticism 
is by the way — is to be found in side-flashes of light 
on single subjects, rather than in a determinate at- 
tempt to get the whole body of Hterature judged in 
lump. 

It may be against the permanence of Arnold's 
criticism, that it was too effective, — that it was 
caught up and absorbed in the thinking of the day. 
Once read, Arnold cannot be forgotten — which may 
be an argument against reading him anew ; whereas 
Lowell's leisurely performances, more deeply in- 
fused with personality, more artistically fashioned, 
leave only a faint memory in our minds, which still 
lures us to read them again and again. 

When it comes to the poetry of the two men, the 
exact reverse of all this is the case. Lowell's poetry 
impresses us tremendously on a first reading, — car- 
ries us off our feet. But we do not want, — at least, 
I do not want, — to recur to it again. Arnold's 
verse, on the other hand, seems a little cold and 
difficult at first, but it fascinates, and we find our- 
selves going back and back to it and carrying it 
always in our memory. The reason is that Lowell 
in verse is primarily a moralist, a preacher ; while 
Arnold is above all things an artist. Lowell started 
in poetry with as good a sensuous equipment as 
Arnold ; but his New England conscience labored 
mightily within him, and killed off the images of 
beauty and grandeur. The Sensuous presented her 
undraped figure to him, but Didacticism plucked 
him back. He saw flowers blossoming beyond him, 
but he was tied to his New England rocks. All that 
noble emotion and high enthusiasm and Drydenic 
eloquence could do he accomplished in the " Com- 
memoration Ode," "The Cathedral," and many 
other pieces. They convince, but they do not charm. 
The soul of poetry is trying to get into a body in 
order to reach us. And once, in the opening lines

[Sept. 16, 



of "The Vision of Sir Launfal " it attains its desire. 
How different is it with Arnold! He too is laden 
with Didacticism, with the passion of thought; but 
he rarely allows these to overweight the form. The 
great ideas of the " Obermann " pieces are em- 
bodied in images which we can see and feel. The 
blank verse of " Empedocles " is as real as the moun- 
tain meadows and thickets themselves ; and the 
enchanting lyrics of that piece gleam like mountain 
nymphs rising from their bath. The thoughts and 
words and cadences of " The Scholar Gypsy " and 
" Thyrsis " are like one rich draught distilled from 
a thousand simples. There can be little question 
which is the greater poet. 

Perhaps Lowell's most unique claim to remem- 
brance is his creative humor. Here and there in 
his essays are little sketches of character which are 
as good as Goldsmith's work in that kind. "The 
Courtin' " is a perfect idyl of humor and tenderness. 
But it is the " Biglow Papers " which prove him to 
be, not certainly our greatest humorist, but our best 
— if that distinction can be understood. He did 
for New England, in a minor way, what Scott or 
Burns did for Scotland — set his community on its 
legs, gave it a separate existence in literature, bodied 
forth the provincialities and oddities which differ- 
entiated it from the rest of the world. The vein of 
humor was in Arnold also, but it only cropped out 
in one little book, " Friendship's Garland." This 
handful of scenes, however, is so replete with wit 
and humor and creative genius that one is willing 
to believe in Arnold's ability to project character to 
any extent had he desired. The balance of good 
work in this kind is largely in Lowell's favor. In 
satire he is without competition from his rival. The 
" Fable for Critics," while too good-natured and too 
entirely of the day to be of great value, has not been 
surpassed in America, and, indeed, it is difficult to 
see that there is anything better in English literature 
since Byron. 

Letter-writing is hardly yet ranked with the ac- 
cepted forms of literature, but I think it will come 
more and more to be received as a delightful kind 
of art. Now Lowell's letters are the best we have 
yet had from an American writer ; indeed, they are 
the only ones which can vie with the best in English 
literature. Poe's letters are the poorest products of 
his pen. Lanier's have much charm, but he was 
so critically wrong-headed about so many things that 
his affectionateness and enthusiasm lose their effect. 
Arnold's letters, so far as they have been given to 
the public, are dull beyond anything one would deem 
possible. They are the epistles of an overworked 
and weary Inspector of Schools, and it would re- 
quire a divining-rod to discover any fount of charm 
in them. 

Lowell and Arnold were both in a large degree 
public men. They were not mere cloistered stu- 
dents, belletristic triflers — as one of them ironically 
dubbed himself ; they were men who mingled in the 
affairs of the world, and whose opinions and acts 
helped to mould great events. The apparent weight 



of influence is on Lowell's side. He was in the thick 
of the fight from the first. His Abolition poems, the 
"Biglow Papers," his many political essays before 
and during the Civil War, undoubtedly made him 
one of the leaders who guided our Republic during 
trying years. And afterwards, his Ambassadorships 
and his addresses in England fairly won him his 
place as our First Citizen. He defended Democracy ; 
but while he loved homely humanity, it is difficult to 
believe that he had much faith in the wisdom of the 
masses. Like every poet, he admired extraordinary 
men and women, and he thought that Democracy 
was the best soil to bring them forth. In comparison 
with these activities, Arnold's public efforts seem 
modest ones. Yet if we count his work in school 
reform, the solvent character of the ideas and 
phrases about social life which he put into circula- 
tion, and the effect of his keen and just criticism of 
Irish affairs, we may find that his influence was at 
least equal to that of his more eminent contemporary. 
There was one field into which Arnold adven- 
tured where Lowell did not follow him. He gave 
up some of his best years to a revision of Christianity 
— to the formulation of a working faith for the mod- 
ern man. He put the ideas of the German and 
French rationalists into attractive guise, gave them 
the stamp of his own nature. But his efforts can 
hardly be counted more than a pleasing futility. 
His idea of a religion with the supernatural, the 
miraculous, left out, is no more like a real religion 
than a domestic Tabby purring by the fireside is like 
the Lion of the Desert, the lordly dreamer whose roar 
dominates the j ungle. He was neither a great enough 
poet nor a deep enough philosopher to understand 
how Superstition — "mother of form and fear" — 
is enthroned in the stoutest and noblest breasts. Man 
knows that he is composed of and surrounded by mir- 
acles and mysteries. A few more or less do not matter 
to him ; rather, he craves them as explaining the ones 
he feels. In the Roman Empire there were writers 
and teachers of philosophy and ethics in plenty — 
Academics, Stoics, Epicureans. They formulated 
maxims and systems of morality as good as any the 
world has known ; but the world about them cared 
little for their labors. When the Latin race found 
its own first simple mythologies fading away, it 
opened its doors to the gorgeous and mystical wor- 
ships of the East. The Magna Mater, Isis, Osiris, 
and Anubis, entered in turn the gates of Rome. 
Men marshalled themselves to follow Cybele ; they 
placed themselves under a platform and bathed in 
the blood of a bull slaughtered above — so to receive 
purification. And when Christianity dawned upon 
the Western World it was not accepted and believed 
because of the personal charm of its founder, because 
of his sweet reasonableness or wit or wisdom. No ; 
it was received because he was thought to be incar- 
nate God — immaculate of birth, a sacrifice for man. 
A halo of all the mysteries and wonders of the world 
was about him, and men's spirits rose and stood on 
tiptoe in rapture and fear. So it ever was, and so 
it always will be. A religion which does not explain

the mazes of our present life, which does not carry 
with it the awful sanctions of the future, cannot live 
or be of use in the world. 

Arnold and Lowell covered more ground than 
almost any of their compeers. Yet probably neither 
of them did the supreme work he dreamed of doing 
— the one thing worth while. Of all their varied 
work, perhaps Arnold's poetry will come to stand 
highest in the estimation of mankind.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



"Light through work" is the encouraging 
motto of the young and active New York Association 
for the Blind, whose " First Report," well illustrated 
and packed with interesting matter, has recently ap- 
peared. The city of New York has more than 2300 
blind persons, and there the first intelligent and en- 
ergetic move on a considerable scale has been made 
toward rendering the lot of the blind less hard by an 
education (in their own homes and elsewhere) that 
shall render them self-supporting and self-respecting 
citizens. Historically, the education of the blind 
may be dated from the hour when the sightless boy 
Leseur, the first pupil of Valentin Hatty, who in 
1784 founded the National Institution for the Blind, 
in Paris, ran to his master with a piece of paper on 
which the letter had been accidentally embossed. 
" Sir," he cried, " I can feel it ; it is the letter O." 
To Miss Winifred Holt, secretary of the New York 
Association, and her sister Miss Edith Holt, the 
recording secretary, is due the credit of taking the 
first steps that led to the formation of the Associa- 
tion. The whole story is interestingly told in the 
Report. The devotion of Miss Winifred Holt to her 
chosen work deserves especial praise. Amid many 
other proofs of her zeal, this passage from her pen 
is significant : " I learned in a short time with bound 
eyes to read both Braille and New York Point and 
to write them ; thus any conclusions which I may 
have reached have been drawn from the blind man's 
standpoint." Illustrations from photographs give 
variety and interest to this readable document, and 
also serve to show how far from helpless the blind 
may become under proper training. A blind barber 
at his work is the subject of one of these pictures. 
Words from Mark Twain and Miss Helen Keller, 
ofiicers of the Association, find appropriate place in 
its Report. 

The leaden-footed library page (of course 
he is not found in any of those well-ordered libraries 
to which The Dial makes its way ) has been made 
the subject of some facetious paragraphs from the 
pen of " The Librarian " of the " Boston Evening 
Transcript." It is pleasant to learn that the long- 
cherished scheme of Mr. Oscar Gustafsen (formerly 
librarian of the Ezra Beesley Free Library of the 
town of Baxter, and now instructor in bibliography 



at Philander University) for establishing a training- 
school for library pages has been in a measure car- 
ried to execution by his successor at Baxter, Miss 
Letitia Van Remsen, in the course of training offered 
by her to would-be pages, under the auspices of the 
Beesley Free Library. While we doubt whether Mr. 
Gustafsen's fond ideal has been entirely realized by 
Miss Van Remsen, yet the entrance examination 
papers set by her give promise of a thorough and 
rigorous training to the successful candidates for 
admission. What could be more admirable than her 
test questions on " General Information and Expe- 
rience " ? After a number of distorted book-titles to 
be put right — a most useful exercise for those who 
have to run for vaguely or wrongly designated books 
— the examination paper proceeds : "(2 ) How do you 
tell a library trustee from one of the ordinary public ? 
(3) Do you smoke cigarettes? (Note: An affirma- 
tive answer will be fatal to your chances of passing ; 
a negative one will cast suspicions on your truthful- 
ness.) (4) What answer would you give to a person 
who asked, ' Is all the friction in the library in this 
room?' (5) Write a description (with diagrams) 
of about 500 words, telling what, in your opinion, 
should be done with (a) the person who says, 'I 
suppose you have read all the books in the library ! * 
(b) the person who says, ' It must be nice to work 
in a library and read all the time ! ' (c) the one who 
remarks, ' Library work must be lovely — it 's such 
clean work ! ' " Ability to pass the entrance examina- 
tion will abundantly prove the candidate's aptitude 
for library work. , , , 

The evolution of " Joshua Whitcomb " is a 
study of some interest and timeliness at this season, 
when "Joshua " himself is beginning his annual tour 
of the large cities. Well on in his seventies now, 
and known to most of us as the slow-moving, good- 
humored, warm-hearted "Uncle Josh," Mr. Denman 
Thompson was in his younger days more celebrated 
on the stage for his nimbleness of foot than for 
his homely, realistic charm as an impersonator of 
Yankee character. An attack of rheumatism worked 
the transformation from vaudeville dancer to star 
actor and universal favorite with the great theatre- 
going public. But the change did not come all at 
once. The initial idea of a quaint, honest, uncari- 
catured Yankee, new to the stage, led first to the 
creation of a twenty-minute sketch of the variety- 
show pattern. It was given for two weeks at Pitts- 
burg in 1875, and thence proceeded to make the 
rounds of the West, winning unusual success. From 
that to the " Joshua Whitcomb " of the New York 
Academy of Music and the Boston Theatre was a 
development of some years. Theatre-managers and 
theatrical critics predicted the flat failure of the 
amorphous production, and did their best to kill it ; 
but the public knew what it liked, and both this 
play and its successor, "The Old Homestead," have 
poured into the pockets of skeptical theatre-managers 
more dollars than could be denoted by fewer than 
seven figures. They have the " one touch of nature "

which goes so much further than art in the long 
run. It is said by those who know Mr. Thompson 
that " Josh " and " Den " are one and the same. 
The only difference between the actor and the man 
is that the latter is even more delightfully real and 
witty, hearty and human, than the former.

Hamlet as an undergkaduate is far less 
known to the world than Hamlet the melancholy 
Dane and Hamlet the madman (genuine or feigned). 
But an anonymous writer in a current periodical in- 
geniously accounts for the unhappy prince's failure 
to grapple promptly and successfully with the situa- 
tion confronting him by ascribing his ineffectiveness 
to an over-addiction to academic pursuits. "The 
simple truth of the matter," declares this writer, " is 
that Hamlet had been too long at the university. We 
find him at thirty still a student at Wittenberg, pro- 
longing his college life nearly ten years beyond the 
legitimate time, whether from difficulty with the 
curriculum, or from desire to participate longer in 
college amusements, or from sheer lust for scholar- 
ship, we do not know. Most of the problems that 
have puzzled the critics can be explained in the light 
of this simple fact, and the evidence in favor of this 
supposition is overwhelming when the text is exam- 
ined. First of all, when the terrible revelation of a 
father's murder, a mother's shame, an uncle's guilt, 
is made to Hamlet by the ghost, what does he do? 
He hunts for his notebook. 

" ' My tablets I Meet it is I set it down 

That one may smile and smile and be a villain.' 

The undergraduate habit of mind! That which 
should have burned itself into the memory forever 
written down to save the trouble of remembering it ; 
moreover, the damning concrete fact turned into a 
generalization ! Here two phases of the training of 
the schools are clearly set forth by Shakespeare." 
After this, who shall say that there is nothing new 
under the sun, or that half the possible books about 
Shakespeare and his plays have yet been written?

Library activity in Indiana is encouragingly 
brisk. This is attested in various ways by the latest 
issue of "Library Occurrent," published by the 
Indiana Public Library Commission. A hopeful 
sign is the bi-state library convention to be held at 
•Louisville, Kentucky, this autumn, when representa- 
tives from both the Blue Grass and the Hoosier states 
will meet, exchange ideas, and incidentally admire 
Louisville's new library building and its branches. 
Much attention is paid to children's wants in this 
number of the " Occurrent." A writer of " Some 
Notes on Children's Books " says, among many other 
things : " Animal stories come next to fairy tales as 
dealing with things most familiar to children. Some 
striking examples of good animal stories are : Beau- 
tiful Joe, Black Beauty, The Jungle Books, and Jack 
the Fire-Dog. When an author has produced one 
good book, always watch for the next one, as it may 
not be up to the standard. Mai'shall Saunders's Beau- 



tiful Joe's Paradise is a monstrosity and a failure." 
Miss Florence L. Jones, of the Indianapolis Public 
Library, writes on " Reference Work with Schools in 
the Indianapolis Public Library." One short para- 
graph that will strike a responsive chord in many a 
library worker's breast runs (in a style that invites 
correction) as follows : " Probably the most difficult 
question that an attendant has to find is material for 
a debate. If a teacher knew how the attendant's 
heart sinks when she hears that word ' Resolved,* 
she would let the library know [sometime in ad- 
vance] that such a debate was to take place." The 
debater is indeed only one degree less patience- 
trying to librarians than the genealogy-hunter.

The Grub Street author of affluence has 
displaced the Grub Street starveling, if we may 
believe Mr. Gilson Willetts, who writes in "The 
American Magazine" of the comparative ease and 
certainty with which a very comfortable income can 
be earned by a literary worker of industry and en- 
terprise. Of his own experience, which certainly 
seems unromantic enough to be true, he says : " I 
have been writing, nothing but writing, for eighteen 
years without a single interruption of any kind, 
always as a free lance. I have produced 7,200,000 
words for which I received $72,000. My articles 
and stories have appeared in ninety different mag- 
azines and weeklies and in forty newspapers, besides 
syndicate articles in 500 newspapers, I have written 
nine books, including two novels, works of reference, 
and books of the ' premium ' class. Combined sale 
of these books, 750,000. I have written more. than 
1500 different magazine articles, and over 100 short 
stories, and heaven knows how many pamphlets and 
advertisements. My ' stuff ' has appeared over 100 
different names. . . . My workshop is a word fac- 
tory ; capacity, 3000 words a day." There is cheer 
and comfort in all this. If the building trades 
decline so that one can no longer be a brick-maker, 
with a capability of three thousand or five thousand 
bricks a day, one can very easily turn writer and 
open a literary workshop, " capacity, 3000 words a 
day." Mr. Willetts reminds us of that anonymous 
author of certain confessions of a hack-writer that 
appeared some years ago in "The Forum." Possi- 
bly he is that anonymous writer, reappearing in one 
of his " one hundred different names " or literary 
disguises. ... 

Architectural effect in the library build- 
ing is probably far more important than most users 
of public libraries suspect. In the mere mounting 
of the marble steps leading to a nobly conceived and 
finely executed structure for the storage and distri- 
bution of books, one's tone is unconsciously elevated 
so that it becomes next to impossible to approach the 
delivery desk and ask, with entire self-respect, for 
a " shilling shocker " instead of a book of real worth. 
An interesting investigation, if one had time and 
patience to make it, would be a careful comparision 
of the grade and character of the reading matter cir-

culated by libraries poorly or meanly housed, and by 
libraries enjoying the dignity of handsome and im- 
posing quarters ; or a comparison of a library's cir- 
culation, in its character and tone, before and after 
l-emoval from shabby surroundings to a more suitable 
and worthy environment. The " Ninth Annual 
Report " of the Carnegie Library of Atlanta contains 
a frontispiece view of the library's new building — 
new, that is, with the opening of the century. The 
imposing front, with its stately Ionic columns, is very 
pleasing to the eye. Some such architectural effect 
we can imagine Madame de Sta6l to have had in 
mind when she wrote, in her " Corinne ": '' La vue 
d'un tel monument est comma une musique contin- 
uelle at fix^e." It is not surprising to be assured by 
Miss Anne Wallace, whose enviable lot it is to occupy 
the post of librarian at Atlanta, that " the Library, 
more than any other department of the City govern- 
ment, shows the growth of the City," and that new 
settlers in Atlanta show a gratifying inclination to 
enjoy the privileges of its fine library.

A MARVEL OF MINUTE BESEAKCH appears in the 
shape of a volume entitled " A Study of Splashes." 
Mr. Andrew Lang writes from London in real or 
pretended perplexity as to the meaning and mission 
of such a book ; " but the title awakens curiosity," 
he adds, " and the volume is by a professor of 
physics at a royal naval engineering college." The 
author, it appears from other and fuller sources of 
information, is Professor Worthington of the Royal 
Naval Engineering College at Davenport, England ; 
and he is said to have spent seven patient years spill- 
ing drops of various liquids from various heights on 
a smooth surface, and studying the resultant splashes, 
thereby (presumably) adding to the sum of human 
knowledge on the laws of impact and the behavior 
of liquid molecules when suddenly arrested in full 
career. Some day — for even the most unpromis- 
ing and, humanly speaking, uninteresting facts do 
sometimes have a way of revealing their significance 
to the right man and on the right occasion — these 
splashes may revolutionize some department of art 
or science. Galileo, counting the oscillations of the 
hanging lamp in the cathedral at Pisa, was probably 
thought by more than one worshipper to be indulg- 
ing a foolish as well as a profane curiosity ; but time 
(as measured by the clock) has abundantly vindi- 
cated the young man. And so the more than Ger- 
man zeal and patience of the liquid-dropping English 
professor may, in time or eternity, be rewarded, and 
minute research will again have justified its ways to 
jmen. . , , 

An Algonquin college pkofessorship would 
strike most people as a novelty in the educational 
world, but a plea for the establishment of one in some 
college of New England where the language was 
once spoken is made by Dr. Edward Everett Hale in 
"The Christian Register." Dr. Hale asserts that 
" the Algonquin languages were and are spoken over 



a wider range of country than the Latin language 
had in the day of the widest range of the Roman 
Empire. At this hour Algonquin dialects are used 
in daily conversation as far as Newfoundland on the 
east and to the neighborhood of Alaska on the west." 
All this is apropos of a recently published history 
of the First Church in Roxbury, which naturally 
revives memories of John Eliot and his missionary 
labors among the Indians, notably his translation of 
the Bible. Dr. Hale thinks that if the book were 
not so exceedingly rare, or if some publisher would 
reprint one of the Gospels as a commercial venture, 
there would be a good many persons interested in 
making some acquaintance with the work. He notes 
with approval the existence of an Indian-language 
professorship at the University of Pennsylvania, 
and thinks that " some one would like to endow a 
scholarship in Harvard or Smith or Amherst or 
Wellesley which shall provide for the education 
of some young person who would agree to study the 
Algonquin language side by side with Greek and 
German and Latin and French and English." May 
the suggestion bear fruit ! But aside from a curious 
interest to the comparative philologist, the Algonquin 
dialects have woefully little to lure the literary stu- 
dent, " side by side with Greek and German and 
Latin and French and English." 
• • • 

A successful novelist's self-restraint in 
production is a manifestation of not exactly daily 
occurrence. Hence our readiness to chronicle, 
with mingled admiration and regret, Mr. Stanley 
J. Weyman's announcement that no more novels 
are to come from his pen. All who have read and 
enjoyed his " Gentleman of France " and " House 
of the Wolf " — pioneers in their kind, being writ- 
ten before the historical romance of word-play and 
hairbreadth escape was done to death — will be 
sorry and at the same time glad that Mr. Weyman 
has dropped his novel-reading public before the lat- 
ter showed signs of dropping him. His latest (and 
last) piece of fiction, " The Wild Geese," was issued 
in a first edition of more than 20,000 copies for 
England alone — an indication of expected if not yet 
fully realized success. Possibly the twenty-thousand 
edition did not go off with all the desired speed. 
At any rate, it is unusual to see a popular novelist 
deliberately and voluntarily • lay down his pen at 
only a little past fifty years of age. We wonder 
whether perhaps Mr. Weyman has been reading 
'* The Altar Fire " and has taken fright at the dismal 
picture there painted of the written-out story-teller. 
His own explanation of his course is as follows : 
" I consider I have been very fortunate ; critics, 
publishers, the public, have all treated me well. I 
am not going to presume upon it. I am 53 ; I have 
had a long run and would far sooner quit the stage 
now, while I am still playing to a full house, than 
go on and tire the audience and ring the curtain 
down at last on half empty benches."

Poet and Herring Merchant.* 

Those who have read FitzGerald's letters, 
and thus become interested in his very unusual 
personality, will welcome Mr. Bljrth's book, 
which tells the story of FitzGerald's remarkable 
friendship for Joseph Fletcher, a sturdy, over 
self-reliant, rather obstinate, and somewhat un- 
appreciative Lowestoft fisherman, and of their 
partnership as owners of a lugger engaged in 
the herring fisheries, a partnership that endured 
for nearly eight years. 

In giving the story of this most remarkable 
friendship, Mr. Blyth introduces effectively a 
series of hitherto unpublished letters from Fitz- 
Gerald to Fletcher, and also several illustrations, 
including portraits of "Posh " (FitzGerald's fa- 
miliar name for Fletcher), and \iews of the places 
about which the interest of the narrative centres. 

The translator, we might almost say the crea- 
tor, of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam so far 
as its English readers are concerned, was fifty- 
six years old when he first met " Posh," who 
was twenty-seven. His admiration and affection 
seem to have been almost immediately engaged ; 
but not even the infinite pains Mr. Blyth has 
taken to portray the big fisherman can explain 
the place he gained in FitzGerald's heart. 
The poet and recluse does not simply extol his 
herring-fisher as great of his kind, but as great 
in the abstract. He invests him with honor, 
truth, integrity, nobility, even with high-born 
qualities of soul. Mr. Blyth looked eagerly for 
these ; it seems as if he really expected to find 
them, or would distrust his own discernment if 
he failed. Yet his minute record is barren of 
the hoped-for results. Even the face of the 
young man, as seen in his portrait, is not alive 
with an alert intelligence. It is weU featured, 
but ordinary and vacant. There is no quotation 
from his conversation or letters which uncovers 
wit, humor, candor, appreciation, pathos, integ- 
rity, affection, or fidelity. 

The letters of the senior member of this 
strange partnership seem struggling to impress 
upon the other such commonplaces of courtesy as 
acknowledging a communication or confidence, 
the common honesty of debt-paying, the common 
importance of a written account in a partnership 
business, the common decency of sobriety, —

Blyth. London: John Long. 



all of which seems to have been received with 
stolid indifference, toleration of the eccentrici- 
ties of gentlemen, or unconcealed resentment. 
Yet for many years FitzGerald identified his 
fortunes with those of " Posh," shut the door of 
one side of his mind, apparently, upon his stored 
oriental imagery, and only let the light in upon 
his views concerning herring and mackerel, and 
the game of "All-fours," — the business, the 
health, the diversion, and the safety of " Posh " 
Fletcher. He even sent the picture of " Posh " 
to his friend Thomas Carlyle, in 1870, with a 
letter in which he describes the original as " en- 
dowed with all the qualities of soul and body to 
make him leader"; and adds : " I know no one 
of sounder sense and grander manners in what- 
ever company." This, of the man who dodged 
and avoided Mr. Blyth, and broke all appoint- 
ments, with the excuse, when finally cornered, 
that one man had made off with his letters " and 
never gave me a farden for what he larnt off o' 
me"; while others had been guilty of " pickin' 
my brains, and never givin' me so much as a six- 
pence." A financial guarantee finally brought 
" Posh " to close quarters, and gave Mr. Blyth a 
chance to search for the basis of FitzGerald's 
infatuation for the man who had " torn up sa«k- 
fuls " of his letters, though the few remaining 
ones were sold for his benefit ; and it is to the 
Omar Khayyam Club and other FitzGerald con- 
nections that the " Posh " of 1907 owes the fact 
of a roof over his head. He was still unable to 
understand that reminiscences of FitzGerald are 
of greater public interest than any recollection 
of " Posh," and insisted on having the dimen- 
sions of the herring-lugger stated in the book, 
because he designed it himself ! 

Mr. Blyth believes that the new personality 
of the youth of twenty-seven magnetized the 
poet of fifty-six. The reader feels like changing 
the expression to hypnotized. Mr. Blyth says 
that FitzGerald "saw his friend through a 
glamor which set up a mirage of things which 
were not, and it was like him to attribute excel- 
lences to his friend which only existed in his 
own imagination." Surely some such strange 
reason must be discovered why a poet who, con- 
fessedly, did not know the stem from the stern 
of a ship, should go into the herring business 
at sixty years of age ! He often found himself 
obliged to remind his ideal Captain of such 
sordid things as the importance of debt-paying, 
— although it does not appear that his anxiety 
was to avoid pecuniary loss to himself, — and 
to admonish him to sobriety, both of which 
were done to sustain his faith in his " man of

a royal nature," of whom he said, " If he should 
turn out knave, I shall have done with all faith 
in my own judgment ; and if he should go to 
the bottom of the sea in the lugger, I shan't 
cry for the lugger." Even in the gayeties of 
London, his imagination brought the fisherman, 
in whose moral excellences he believed, to bear 
him better company, and to " make a face " at 
the environment. 

It was through the two faults which the silent 
partner would hardly admit as faults, that the 
partnership in the " Meum and Tuum," as 
FitzGerald said, " turned out all Tuum and no 
Meum," and after many broken promises was 
finally dissolved ; although the disappointed 
senior had declared : " If he is but what I think 
him, I would rather lose money with him than 
gain it with others." To Professor Cowell he 
wrote : " You can't think what a grand, tender 
soul he is ! " And to Mr. Spalding : " It makes 
me feel ashamed very much to play the judge 
on one who stands immeasurably above me in 
the scale, whose faults are better than so many 
virtues." 

The bitterness of FitzGerald's dawning dis- 
covery that his estimate of his protege's char- 
acter was too exalted, with his growing loss of 
confidence and respect, constituted a sore expe- 
rience ; but his love and solicitude for " Posh " 
survived even the latter's stupid ingratitude. 
Mr. Blyth well says : 

" No one has a greater admiratioa than I for this 
magnificent claim of a MAN to be MAN'S equal. But 
with FitzGerald, who never asserted the claims of his 
station in life before an inferior, the obtrusive display 
of this spirit of independence was as unnecessary as it 
was cruel. And I think Posh understands this now. 
. . . But in 1869, Posh thought that he was a very fine 
fellow indeed, and was not going to be put upon by any 
' guvnor,' no matter how kind the ' guvnor ' had been to 
him. He would assert himself. He did." 

It was as late as 1870 that FitzGerald asked 
Laurence to paint a portrait of " Posh," and said : 
" The man's soul is every way as well propor- 
tioned, missing in nothing that may become a 
man. ... I should like a large oil sketch, to 
hang up with Thackeray and Tennyson, with 
whom he shares a certain grandeur of soul and 
body." And again : " You will see a little of his 
simplicity of soul ; but not the Justice of Thought, 
Tenderness of Nature, and all other good gifts 
which make him a Gentleman of Nature's grand- 
est type." Later still, he writes to Laurence : " I 
am sure the man is fit to be king of a kingdom. 
I declare you and I have seen A Man ! Have 
we not ? Made in the mould of what Humanity 
should be. Body and Soul, a poor Fisherman." 



Even in 1874, he writes : " There is greatness 
about the Man. . . . Your Cromwells, Caesars, 
and Napoleons have not been more scrupulous." 

The break came, " Posh " admits, by his own 
motion. The conclusion of FitzGerald had been, 
" The Man is so beyond others, as I think, that 
I have come to feel that I must not condemn him 
by general rule." He had written and sealed 
a document which would secure to " Posh " 
immunity from indebtedness to his estate if he 
should die ; but he had exacted a promise of 
sobriety, which was promptly broken. " Posh " 
still upholds his independence in the matter, 
especially as to the restriction that he should be 
a teetotaller. 

In 1 874 the " Mum Turn " was sold at auction ; 
and long afterward, when she was broken up, 
her name-board was presented to the Omar 
Khaj^am Club. FitzGerald had been dimly 
disillusioned, — and he was old. " He was a 
good gentleman, was Old Fitz," say the rem- 
nant of East Anglian fishermen ; who, unaware 
of the poet, well remember the faithful friend 
of « Posh " Fletcher. 

Mr. Blyth ends his record thus : 

" The last time he was with me I read him — 

'' ' The moving Finger writes, and having writ. 
Moves on : nor all your Piety and Wit 

Shall lure it back to cancel half a line. 
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it.' 

" ' Well, tha'ss a mm un! ' said Posh."

Phases of Modern^ Socialism.* 



Mr. H. G. Wells, as he himself explains, 
" calls himself a Socialist, but he is by no means 
a fanatical or uncritical adherent. To him, 
Socialism presents itself as a very noble but a 
very human and fallible system of ideas. He 
does in all sincerity regard its spirit, its intimate 
substance, as the most hopeful thing in human 
affairs at the present time, but he does also find 
it shares with all mundane concerns the quali- 
ties of inadequacy and error." 

The book which Mr. Wells has written from 
this standpoint, entitled " New Worlds for Old," 
forms a very good introduction to Socialism. 
It will attract and interest those who are not of 
that faith, and correct those who are. The 
socialist propaganda in America has been suc- 
cessful in gaining a constantly increasing num-

ber of adherents, but it must be confessed that 
the most obvious common bond among the 
" comrades " is that of discontent with existing 
conditions, rather than any constructive plan. 
Herein, no doubt, the movement has followed 
the line of the least resistance, it being taken 
for granted that if the ship could fairly get under 
way she would have no difficulty in reaching her 
port of destination. This attitude is not peculiar 
to socialists ; it is very conspicuous among vari- 
ous religious societies ; but it has been especially 
fostered by those almost fatalistic notions of 
political economy which have been handed down 
from earlier times. Mr. Wells graphically 
describes a meeting of the Social-Democratic 
Federation in London, at which Mr. Hyndman 
lectured on the coming revolution. At the end, 
questions were handed in on smalls slips of 
paper, one of them being, " Why trouble to 
agitate or work if the trusts are going to do it 
all for us?" 

" The veteran leader of the Social-Democratic Feder- 
ation paused only for a moment. ' Well, we 've got to 
get ready for it, you know,' he said, rustling briskly 
with the folds of the question to follow; and with these 
words, it seemed to me, that fatalistic Marxism crum- 
bled down to dust. 

" We have got to get ready for it. Indeed, we have 
to make it, by education and intention and set reaolve" 
(p. 236J.. 

The last sentence contains the burden of our 
author's message to the socialists themselves. 
He would not wait for the automatic fruition of 
inevitable tendencies ; but would recognize, in 
the fullest possible manner, that if anything 
good is to come of it all, it will need the active 
cooperation of mind and muscle in constructive 
ways. It is perhaps only too possible that a 
nation, like an individual, might become sat- 
urated with discontent, only to recognize its 
inability to remove the cause. 

The same idea emerges in a quite different 
manner in the discussion of Fabian Socialism, 
which is so practical that it often goes too far, 
in Mr. Wells's opinion, in attempting to utilize 
existing agencies. 

" In all these matters the real question at issue is one 
between the emergency and the implement. One may 
illustrate by a simple comparison. Suppose there is a 
need to dig a hole and that there is no spade available, 
a Fabian with Mr. Webb's gifts becomes invaluable. 
He seizes upon a broken old cricket bat, let us say, uses 
it with admirable wit and skill, and presto ! there is 
the hole made and the moral taught that one need not 
always wait for spades before digging holes. It is a 
lesson that Socialism stood in need of, and which hence- 
forth it will always bear in mind. But suppose we want 
to dig a dozen holes, it may be worth while to spend a 
little time in going to beg, borrow, or buy a spade. If 



we have to dig holes indefinitely, day after day, it will 
be sheer foolishness sticking to the bat. It will be 
worth while then not simply to get a spade, but to get 
just the right sort of spade in size and form that the 
soil requires, to get the proper means of sharpening and 
repairing the spade, to insure a proper supply. Or to 
point the comparison, the reconstruction of our legisla- 
tive and local government machinery is a necessary pre- 
liminary to Socialization in many directions. Mr. Webb 
has very effectually admitted that, is in fact himself 
leading us away from that by taking up the study of 
local government as his principal occupation, but the 
typical ' Webbite ' of the Fabian Society, who is very 
much to Webb what the Marxist is to Marx, entranced 
by his leader's skill, still clings to the earlier Fabian 
ideal. He dreams of the most foxy and wonderful dig- 
ging by means of box-lids, tablespoons, dishcovers — 
anything but spades designed and made for the job in 
hand — just as he dreams of an extensive expropriation 
of landlords by legislation that includes the House of 
Lords " (pp. 254-255). 

The Rev. R. J. Campbell, Minister of the 
City Temple, London, is a very well known and 
eloquent preacher, who hag recently declared 
himseK a Socialist, to the distress of many of his 
brother nonconformists. In his book on " Chris- 
tianity and the Social Order " he undertakes to 
describe Christianity, as he understands it, and 
then to show how it harmonizes with Socialism. 
His account of the origin and nature of the 
Christian faith would be repudiated by the so- 
caUed orthodox churches, but it is honest and in 
accord with the historical facts, so far as the 
author was able to ascertain them. I do not 
know where a better general discussion of the 
subject may be found ; it is wholly sympathetic, 
yet not at the expense of truth, and might well 
carry conviction to those who would not be 
moved by a colder and more purely scientific 
treatment. 

Mr. Campbell does not find in the teaching of 
Jesus anything resembling modern Socialism, 
except in purpose and in spirit ; but these are 
the fundamental things. 

" He had no economic theories; no interest in indus- 
triaUsm; and laid down no directions for the administra- 
tion of the ideal State, or the guidance of the individual 
in his social relationships; His idea was supernatural 
revolution, not social evolution. But the one undeniable 
and all-important fact about the preaching of this great- 
est of the sons of men is that it was inspired by a pro- 
found belief in the coming of a better day and an ideal 
human society on earth. He never says a word about 
going to heaven, for the plain and simple reason that all 
His hopes were bound up with the realization of heaven 
here. His illusions were those of the period in which, 
and the people among whom, He did His work; His 
ideal is for all time, and is the inspiration of all that is 
best and noblest in human aspiration and effort to-day " 
(p. 16). 

The sociological part of the book does not appear 
to me to be so good — partly, perhaps, because

the author has not so long been familiar with the 
matters discussed. 

: To the reader who has no sympathy with 
socialistic theories, it will doubtless seem that 
the two books I have attempted to describe have 
been altogether overpraised. To such readers I 
would merely say this : that, after all, the dyna- 
mic conception of society holds ; what we see and 
have our part in is not merely a phenomenon, but 
a process, and in the long run humanity will 
need all the guidance it can get. It is not prob- 
able that the dreams of now living Socialists will 
ever come true in any literal sense ; but they 
will nevertheless be woven into the fabric of 
things, and will stand out as real contributions 
to an edifice the form of which was beyond their 
imagining. Two things, however, are certain : 
one, that there wiU be change, and the other that 
goodwill is indispensable for the well-being of 
mankind. The Socialists, like Jesus, at least 
forsee the one and possess the other, — the latter, 
in spite of occasional appearances to the contrary.

The Jugglers and the Railroads.* 



The strenuous conduct of the chief executive 
officer of our nation, in his effort to enforce the 
recent legislation concerning corporations, has 
turned the attention of the public with much 
intensity upon every phase of the railroad in- 
dustry. But the public gaze, though intent, 
has not been discerning, as is evidenced by the 
storm of disapprobation that has greeted the 
recent decision of the Federal Court of Appeals 
at Chicago in the Standard Oil case. To a 
thoughtful observer, it is amazing to note how 
intelligent and educated men fail, in discussing 
this case, to distinguish between the substance 
and the method of court procedure. One is fain 
to believe that the distinction between executive 
and legislative and judicial functions, imbedded 
as it is in our Constitution, has never really 
taken hold on the American mind, although it 
is a commonplace of every elementary text-book 
on our government. The outcry against the 
decision read by Judge Grosscup suggests un- 
pleasantly that the canon of conduct so long 
opprobriously assigned to the Jesuits as their 
peculiar property — that " the end justifies the 
means " — has been assimilated by many secular 
minds as well as Jesuitical ones. However that

may be, the decision calls a halt in the indis- 
criminate condemnation of corporations, and 
will doubtless do muph to restore heart and faith 
to that not unimportant portion of the com- 
munity which, through the investment of its 
savings, furnishes the means of carrying on 
business. 

The literature ©£ railroad, problems, which 
has been coming so abundantly from the press 
in the last two years, is imdoubtedly forming as 
well as expressing an intelligent opinion that 
must control in the end. Among books of this 
class, Mr. Daggett's work on " Railroad Re- 
organization " is doing an inestimable service in 
discussing one of the most recondite as well as 
most important phases of railway management — 
and mismanagement. The public are already 
sufficiently acquainted with the salient features 
of railway operation to be able to understand the 
evils of rebating and undercutting as they have 
affected the user of transportation ; but little 
that is intelligible has been written concerning 
the sins committed in the fields of constructive 
financiering. Mr. Daggett has given us a care- 
ful and elaborate account of the reorganization 
of eight great systems — reorganization neces- 
sitated, in the majority of cases, by excessive 
capitalization in the interest of reckless exten- 
sions going hand in hand with unfair concessions. 
In the case of two of the roads presented in this 
treatise — the Rock Island and the Alton — the 
reorganization was influenced by great pros- 
perity. In the words of Mr. Daggett, " It was 
desired to reap a profit by the sale of new 
securities, as well as to lessen the investment 
required for control." The causes and methods 
of reorganization are thus admirably summarized : 
" A railroad is a complex financial as well as a com- 
plex operating machine. Especially when it has been 
built up by the union of numerous small properties, 
each of which has been allowed to retain a certain indi- 
viduality of its own, are the relations between the dif- 
ferent parts intricate and involved. The obligations 
which have been incurred in the course of its career, 
and the kinds of paper which represent these obligations, 
disclose a variety which the debts of an individual sel- 
dom or never present. This complexity in railroad 
capitalization inevitably leads to clashes in interest 
between different classes of security-holders. . . . If 
classes of securities exist upon which payment of inter- 
est is optional, it is to the advantage of the junior issues 
to prevent payment of interest or dividends upon others 
until earnings are such that payment may be made 
upon all. If common stockholders can reinvest in the 
property sums which normally would be paid in divi- 
dends on the preferred stock, they advance the day 
upon which they can secure dividends for themselves 
at the expense of their seniors. . . . Or, again, it may 
be to the advantage of speculative stockholders to 
pay dividends to themselves by means of the accumu-

lation of a floating debt, and to sell out at top quo- 
tations, being the floating debt to take precedence even 
of mortgage bonds. Both this and the preceding oper- 
ation are facilitated by the control which the least 
valuable portion of the capital, the common stock, usu- 
ally has over the policy of the entire company. But it 
is when a reorganization becomes necessary that these 
conflicts in interest become most apparent, and it is as 
a compromise between contending forces that a reorgan- 
ization plan mtist take its shape." 

Just at the present time, when the railroads 
are making a combined demand for increased 
rates in order that they may avoid the other 
alternatives of decreased wages or reduced 
dividends, it is of value to have emphasized, as is 
here done, the facts of reorganization as affect- 
ing security-holders. In Erie, Philadelphia & 
Reading, Southern, Santa Fe, Rock Island, and 
Union and Northern Pacifies, it has been neces- 
sary again and again to sacrifice the equitable 
rights of stockholders, so as to " squeeze out 
water " and allow of the road being put on a 
basis of restored vitality. What has been done 
frequently, may still be done ; and the choice 
so made, as between the equally innocent in- 
vestors and consumers, is in favor of the latter. 
In such a choice, the equitable defense is made 
by emphasizing the involuntary nature of the 
relation of the shipper to the transport systems, 
while that of the investor is optional. Not until 
Mr. Taft's suggestion is embodied in law, and 
all future issue of bonds or stocks are placed 
under the supervision of some government board 
of control, can the investor find protection from 
his own ignorance or his own folly, as they play 
into the hands of reckless and unscrupulous 
promoters of the Wall Street type.

A Pioneer American Schoolmaster.* 



The first American writer upon education and 
the author of the first American treatise upon 
conduct was Christopher Dock, a native of 
Germany, who taught school among the Penn- 
sylvania Germans of Southeastern Pennsyl- 
vania between the years 1718 and 1771. About 
a quarter of a century ago. Governor Penny- 
packer of Pennsylvania translated into English 
Dock's description of his method of teaching, 
together with several of his hymns ; and now 
Dr. Brumbaugh, formerly Commissioner of

LL.D., Ex-Governor of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia: J. B. 
Lippincott Co. 



Education in Porto Rico, at present Superinten- 
dent of the Philadelphia Public Schools, has 
brought together all of the known writings of 
the Pennsylvania German schoolmaster, giving 
the German text, an English translation, and a 
sketch of the teacher's life. Among Dock's 
pupils was Christopher Saur, who succeeded his 
father at the head of the Germantown printing- 
house which printed three editions of the Bible 
in German before an English edition appeared 
in America. 

Christopher Dock's method of arousing the 
ambition of his pupils and of putting the slothful 
to shame, differing widely from the educational 
methods then in vogue, won the admiration of 
the elder Saur, who with much difficulty per- 
suaded Dock to write a treatise describing his 
plan of organizing and conducting a school. The 
manuscript was completed in 1750, and after 
a number of vicissitudes was published by Saur 
in 1770. An indication of Dock's method is 
given in his description of the way a new pupil 
was received. 

" The child is first given a welcomie by the other chil- 
dren who extend their hands to him. Then I ask him 
if he will be diligent and obedient. If he promises 
this, he is told how to behave, and when he can say his 
A, B, C's, and point out each letter with his index 
finger, he is put into the Ab. When he reaches this 
class his father owes him a penny, and his mother must 
fry him two eggs for his diligence, and the same re- 
ward is due him with each advance, for instance, when 
he enters the word class. But when he enters the read- 
ing class, I owe him a present, if he reaches the class in 
the required time and has been diligent, and the first 
day this child comes to school he receives a note stating, 
' Diligent. One pence.' This means that he has been 
admitted to the school, but it is also explained to him 
that if he is lazy or disobedient his note is taken from 
him. Continued disinclination to learn and stubborness 
causes the pupil to be proclaimed lazy and inefficient 
before the whole class, and he is told that he belongs in 
a school of incorrigibles. Then I ask the child again if 
he will be diligent and obedient. Answering yes, he is 
shown his place. If it is a boy, I ask the other boys, 
if a girl, I ask the girls, who among them will take 
care of this new child and teach it. According to the 
extent to which the child is known, or its pleasant or 
unpleasant appearance, more or less children express 
the willingness. If none apply, I ask who will teach 
this child for a certain time for a bird or a writing-copy. 
Then it is seldom difficult to get a response." 

In similar detail Dock described the pupils' 
progress through his school. Of one stage he 
said : 

" Those who know their lesson receive an O on the 
hand, traced with crayon. This is a mark of excellence. 
Those who fail more than three times are sent back to 
study their lesson again. When all the little ones have 
recited these are asked again, and any one having failed 
in more than three trials a second time is called ' Lazy ' 
by the entire class, and his name is written down.

Whether such a child fear the rod or not, I know from 
experience that this denunciation of the children hurts 
more than if I were constantly to wield and flourish the 
rod. If the pupil's name has not been erased before 
dismissal the pupils are at liberty to write down the 
names of those who have been lazy, and take them along 
home. But if the child learns his lesson well in the 
future, his name is again presented to the other pupils 
and they are told that he knew his lesson well and failed 
in no respect. Then all the pupils call < Diligent ' to him. 
When this has taken place his name is erased from the 
slate of lazy pupils, and the former transgression is for- 
given." 

Dock required his older pupils to carry on a 
weekly correspondence with pupils of like ability 
in another school, and of this plan, the pious, 
loving schoolmaster said : " I doubt not, if two 
schoolmasters loving one another and desiring 
their pupils to love one another, were to do this 
in the love of God, it would bear fruit." With 
the unruly, the covetous, the vain, the over- 
ambitious, the dishonest, the untruthful, for 
each he had a different method. Experience 
had taught him, he said, that a timid child is 
harmed rather than benefitted by harsh words 
and a stupid child made worse. One driver, he 
continued, does not employ half the shouting, 
spurring, and whipping with his horses that 
another does, and yet takes a heavier burden 
over hill and dale. His minute rules of conduct 
also had their foundation in good judgment and 
also possess the interest derived from a portrayal 
of the customs of the colonial period. It was 
Dock's daily habit to place the roll of his pupils 
before him and in private say a brief prayer 
for each one. One evening in the autumn of 
1771 he was found dead upon his knees in his 
schoolroom. His was a singularly sweet and 
unselfish character. His intelligence was of a 
rare degree of fineness. His writings possess a 
special interest for all who are engaged in edu- 
cational work, and they are, moreover, one of 
the foundation-stones of American culture.

The First Court of the Bourboxs.* 



If Henry Fourth's marriage to Marie de 
Medicis was mainly an expedient to lessen his 
debts to her Grand Ducal uncle and to obtain 
ready money besides, he risked gaining a repu- 
tation for meanness in order that her extrava- 
gances might not deprive him of the profits of

Century. Translated from the French of Louis Batiffol, by

the operation. In only one year from 1601 to 
1610, says M. Louis Batiffol in his volume en- 
titled " Marie de Medicis and the French Court," 
did she live on her income, although it was larger 
than that provided for former queens. She had 
a weakness for precious stones, and especially 
for diamonds ; and whenever one of her jewel- 
lers discovered a rare stone the Queen ordered 
its purchase immediately, even if her pin-money 
account, of 36,000 livres, had long been over- 
drawn. When her debts became pressing, she 
applied to the King ; and he, in order to put an 
effective brake on such expenditure, did not give 
her the money outright, but assigned some source 
of revenue which would bring the whole matter 
within the province of that shrewd and stubborn 
economist. Sully. M. Batiffol does not appear 
to think that in this attempt to protect the 
treasury from the inroads of Queen Marie's de- 
mands the King was moved altogether by reasons 
of state, for he caustically remarks that Henry 
preferred to save his ready money for his mis- 
tresses. 

Although Marie de Medicis is the principal 
subject of M. Batiffol's volume, the author 
makes no attempt to give a complete view of 
her character, for his descriptions of her court 
do not go beyond 1617, the year of her loss of 
political power. He intimates that adversity 
developed the less agreeable elements of her 
character, as her sudden elevation to authority 
in 1610 had brought out qualities of application 
to affairs of state which none had discovered 
during the life of Henry IV. Her character, as 
it is revealed gradually in successive chapters on 
the " Queen's Day," the " Queen's Household," 
" Palace Life," etc., is not attractive. Interest 
in her is aroused by the account of the tedious 
marriage negotiations which left her uncertain 
of her fate until she was twenty-seven years old. 
This sympathy is weakened by a process of attri- 
tion, as in the course of the narrative several 
qualities appear, one after another, which are 
obviously unamiable. According to the author, 
she possessed " a nature meagrely endowed with 
heart or brains." She was so obstinate that the 
King, being angered one day by the Dauphin's 
willfulness, said to Marie, " Knowing your dis- 
position, and foreseeing what like will be that 
of your son — yours, Madame, obstinate, not to 
say stubborn, and his opinionated — I am as-

prophecy, M. Batiffol adds, only too well ful- 
filled. Her other qualities M. Batiffol sums up 
in the remark, " The impression to be derived

from considering the words and actions of Marie 
de Medicis during the ten years of her residence 
in France is that of a woman not sure of herself, 
unstable, agitated, incapable of reasoning con- 
secutively and firmly — frankly a character both 
mediocre and vacillating." But it would have 
required a person of remarkable self-control to 
put up with the affronts she endured, beginning 
with the King's leaving her a few days after 
their marriage to hurry to the chateau of 
Henriette d'Entraigues, and including as an 
incident the birth of a Due de Verneuil within 
a short time, of the birth of the Dauphin. 

There is some curious information in the 
chapter on '• The Queen's Purse," showing how 
minutely the expenditure within her power was 
supervised. What the author says about the 
regulation of the royal expenditure in general 
might mislead the reader to suppose that there 
was a budget with something like the modern 
system of assignment of appropriations. Among 
the minor characters described in the volume is 
the Queen's friend, Leonora Galiga'i, with her 
peculiarities, her love of money, and her nervous 
ailments. Perhaps the most attractive chapter 
in the book describes the relations of the Queen 
and her children. Even if she may be accused of 
lack of self-control in other respects, in this she 
never was betrayed into inordinate sentiment. 
M. Batiffol is, however, not quite consistent 
with himself in describing her characteristics as 
a mother. Her scheme of discipline was one of 
rewards and punishments, toys and whippings. 
She ordered Louis XIII. whipped even after he 
moimted the throne. When, immediately after 
this punishment, he entered her apartments 
and she rose as etiquette demanded, he made 
the pointed remark, child though he was, " I 
would be better pleased with less obeisance and 
less whipping." 

The author's aim in writing this book was 
not so much to produce diverting descriptions 
and tell interesting tales as to contribute a study 
of a phase of French society. He has achieved 
his purpose within the somewhat narrow limits 
of the subject, although the study will be read 
perhaps more for its lighter interest than for its 
historical value. One of his judgments is cer- 
tainly open to criticism. This questions the 
integrity of Sully, Henry's great minister of 
finance. The tendency of accredited opinion 
seems to be the other way, for investigation has 
shown that Sully owed his fortune chiefly to the 
gifts of a grateful monarch.

Briefs on New Books. 



Popular account ^^■■^' «• Keane is already well 
of the peoples known to all who are interested m 
of the earth. ^j^g gtu(jy of the races of man through 
two of his earlier works — " Ethnology " and " Man, 
Past and Present." Both books are now standard 
works of reference, and must be at the hand of every 
student in their field. While many opinions ex- 
pressed in them fail to gain assent, and the dogmatic 
style of the author arouses a feeling of belligerency 
on the part of a well-informed reader, they have 
proved most stimulating, and by their copious refer- 
ence to original authorities have done much to foster 
a true spirit of research. In his more recent work 
on "The World's Peoples" (Putnam), Dr. Keane 
aims to present his material in a more popular form, 
and, omitting all references and footnotes, to make 
a work which shall appeal to a wider circle of 
readers. " The World's Peoples " is, he says, " a 
popular accoimt of their bodily and mental charac- 
ters, beliefs, traditions, political and social institu- 
tions." The book will no doubt prove useful, 
although in the nature of things it is less satisfactory 
to the student than the others mentioned. It neces- 
sarily repeats the material contained in them, but 
is diluted and " written down " to the popular mind. 
There is no new matter except a little drawn from 
works published since his earlier works were printed. 
Much that was in them is here omitted, as being 
"debatable questions." The author says: "This 
book therefore deals, not with faint probabilities, 
but with established facts." After this statement 
one must be somewhat surprised at some of the 
assertions. Why can we locate the human cradle 
" with some certainty in the Eastern Archipelago and 
more particularly in the island of Java " ? Surely, 
Dubois's discovery at Trinil is not warrant for such 
location : it would not be, even if Pithecanthropus 
erectus were as ancient as was at first claimed. 
We make no polygenistic argument, but surely Dr. 
Keane's presentation against it, on his opening page, 
is absurd and unfair in that it constructs a man of 
straw and fails absolutely to present the views of 
any competent polygenist. What does Dr. Keane 
mean by saying that there are no terms for numerals 
beyond 2 or 3 in Australia ? Conant presents such. 
What does Dr. Keane mean by saying that Philip- 
pine negritos "neither keep slaves themselves nor 
endure the yoke of servitude " ? Neither part of 
the statement is true. These may seem small 
matters, but they must be noticed when they occur 
in a book which claims to present only established 
facts. Unfortunately, such mis-statements are ex- 
tremely common. There are some points in method, 
too, that demand mention. We regret that Dr. 
Keane here adopts the ill-advised term Amerind. 
There are no new reasons in favor of its use, and it 
is surely not gaining ground in America. The only 
apparent reason why he uses it is that he has read 
Dellenbaugh recently. So, too, it is a Httle late to

emphasize Powell's termination -an for linguistic 
family names, and to extend its use. American 
students were for a time subservient in the matter, 
but Dr. Keane must know that present tendency is 
away from the Powellian rule. As for the term 
JPuebloan, so far as we know original in scientific 
writing with Dr. Keane, we deplore it. In spite of 
its defects, the book is readable, well illustrated, and 
in some respects a convenient manual. Such a work 
is needed, and is particularly difficult to produce. 
Most recent efforts in this direction have not been 
particularly happy. The last great book of the kind 
was Peschel's : would that someone in this generation 
would give us one as good ! 



Newipaper 
articles worth 
reprinting. 



Editorials written for the daily press 
are commonly so ephemeral in char- 
acter, so partisan in tone, or so local 
and restricted in interest, that they would not well 
stand the test of republication in book form. Many 
of the editorials reprinted in Mr. Fabian Franklin's 
"People and Problems" (Holt) treat of issues no 
longer living ; but there is enough of present interest 
in the book to give it life as a whole, while every 
page is marked by a style so little " journalistic " as 
to make the entire volume attractive- Four papers 
of a more weiglity character precede these brief edi- 
torials: they are three public addresses ( "Newspapers 
and Exact Thinking," "James Joseph Sylvester," 
and " A Defect of Public Discussion in America "), 
and an article on "The Intellectual Powers of 
Women" contributed to "The North American 
Review." The author shows himself to have read 
with approval Colonel Higginson on the woman ques- 
tion, and he takes occasion to make an apt quotation 
from him. Mr. Franklin's early devotion to math- 
ematics, of which he was at one time professor at the 
Johns Hopkins University, has left its good results 
in the exactness and restraint of his literary style. 
Let us quote a sentence from his opening chapter. 
" The fact is," he declares, " when it comes to our 
desires and prejudices, it goes against the grain to 
say we don't know ; and if we are unwilling to say 
that, we are not in the attitude of the scientific man, 
and we are not likely to do exact thinking." The 
editorials, it may be well to state, are republished 
from " The Baltimore News," of which Mr. Franklin 
assumed the editorship in 1895, leaving the Johns 
Hopkins mathematical professorship to enter on this 
other work, so vastly different in character. 



The Iliad 
of the East, 1 
in English. 



The oriental and the occidental tem- 
per are so widely different, notwith- 
standing all assertions and arguments 
to the contrary, that the literature of India will 
probably never be thoroughly popular with us. Gems 
from the Sanskrit poets are now and again imported 
from Asia, provided with a European setting, and 
offered for sale in the Western market; but still 
the demand for these wares remains comparatively 
small. Miss Frederika Macdonald has done every- 
thing possible to make attractive her selections from 



the " Ramayana " in a volume which she entitle.s 
"The Iliad of the East" (Lane), and which Mr. 
J. Lockwood Kipling has illustrated in his well- 
known manner. The book is essentially a reprint, 
as the introduction explains. It was thirty-eight 
years ago that Miss Macdonald first published these 
selected episodes from Valmiki's great poem. " The 
book represents," she writes, " no scholarly effort to 
reproduce the original Sanskrit text literally, but 
only a nosegay of stories gathered in the course of 
my own explorations of the 'immense flowering 
forest of Valmiki ' as it was thrown open to an un- 
learned reader like myself in the admirable French 
translation of Hippolyte Fauche." Miss Macdonald 
calls her book, somewhat surprisingly, " the only 
attempt ever made to invite English readers with 
no exclusive knowledge of Indian literature [are 
there any English readers with such exclusive 
knowledge ?] to acquaint themselves with the 
peculiar charm and perfume, and with the senti- 
mental temper so akin to their own, which pervade 
this old story-land." The Brahman compilers and 
editors of the poem have commended it in terms 
that, if taken literally, leave no doubt of its merits. 
The attentive reader of it " shall be delivered from 
sin. . . . He shall have sons if he desire sons ; he 
shall have riches if he long for riches. . . . The 
young girl who desires a husband shall obtain this 
husband to delight her soul. . . . Those who in the 
world listen to this poem, composed by Valmiki 
himself, shall acquire every gift, the object of their 
desire, just as they may have wished." Mr- 
Kipling's bas-reliefs, photographically reproduced, 
are curiously and skilfully wrought; but, to para- 
phrase Dr. Johnson, the wonder is, not that the 
book-illustrator has done his work so well, but rather 
that he should be able, with the limitations and 
restrictions he has imposed upon himself, to &o it 
at all. 

On the track ^^' '^' ^' Hammerton, the enam- 
of Stevenson oured Stevensonian and compiler of

by his love for " R. L. S." to go forth in search 
of material for another somewhat similar volume, 
which he entitles " In the Track of R. L. Stevenson, 
and Elsewhere in Old France" (Dutton). Those 
diverting and original travel sketches, " An Inland 
Voyage" and "Travels with a Donkey," dear to 
every Stevenson lover, however unenthusiastic over 
narratives in general of that class, gave Mr. Ham- 
merton his itinerary, ready-made ; and with zeal and 
manifest delight he has traced his hero's course from 
village to village and from one humble wayside inn 
to another. Writing of the Trappist monastery of 
Our Lady of the Snows, which Stevenson confesses 
that he approached with "unaffected terror," his 
faithful follower has this interesting passage : " The 
library, which occupies a spacious room on the upper 
story of the north wing, is stocked with some twenty 
thousand volumes, chiefly in Latin and French, but 
including an excellent collection of works in Greek,

religion and history being naturally the chief subjects 
represented. When we remember that many of the 
monks are men of no great intellectual gifts and of 
small learning, being drawn largely from the peasant 
class and the military, we may doubt if the treasures 
of the library are in great request. The librarian, 
at least, must be a man of bookish tastes, since the 
collection is arranged in perfect order. Our guide 
assured us that the monastery possesses a copy of 
Travels with a Donkey, but he did not discover it 
for us." Only think of the quiet, preserved without 
police intervention, in a Trappist library ! Surely, 
the conditions for reading and study there are unsur- 
passed, — but the readers and students are wanting. 
Chapters on the country of the Camisards, the town 
of the immortal "Tartarin" (Tarascon), "Round 
about a French Fair," and other agreeable topics, 
supplement the Stevensonian travels. The hillside 
village of Pradelles has suggested to the author a 
new word, " slanternness," expressive but not strictly 
needed. Ninety-two clear illustrations from photo- 
graphs help one to follow the author in his devious 
but interesting course. 

The history of the printed book, 
SeprSd iooA. *^o™ *^« obscure beginnings of rock- 
marking and tally-stick notching, up 
through the parchment roll to the neat and service- 
able and inexpensive product of our great modern 
book-making establishments, has been compendi- 
ously and at the same time interestingly traced by 
the master-hand of Mr. Cyril Davenport in a handy 
volume entitled " The Book : Its History and De- 
velopment " (Van Nostrand). Illustrations, many 
in number and sometimes curious in character, help 
to tell the story of the book's gradual evolution. 
Minute details of paper-making, binding, engraving, 
decorating, and other subsidiary and ancillary arts, 
are not wanting, all set forth with a fulness of 
knowledge and a diligence of research that are most 
praiseworthy. The bibliography ("Books to Con- 
sult " ) appended to each chapter enables the student 
to pursue considerably further any branch of the 
general subject that may especially interest him; 
and it incidentally reminds the reader that Mr. 
Davenport is a somewhat prolific author in this his 
chosen field. Let us cull one item of information, 
probably new to ninety-nine readers out of a hun- 
dred. How can we account for the great length 
(sixteen and seventeen feet, and even more) of 
ancient vellum rolls in one continuous strip? Not 
even the longest-necked giraffe would furnish such 
a stretch of skin all in one piece. Mr. Davenport 
teUs us that he " consulted a clever leather worker 
and gave him a skin measuring about 3 feet by 2, 
suggesting certain ways of cutting it. He produced 
eventually, by wetting, pulling, and pinning, a beau- 
tiful roll of nearly 4 inches in breadth and 16 feet 
9 inches in length." On an early page the writer 
says, rather imaccountably, that "the modern en- 
graving of inscriptions on metal has mainly found 
refuge in monumental brasses, and in this case the

Nations. 



letterings are usually run in with some pigment " — 
as if inscriptions on silver, gold, bronze, copper, 
steel, and brass too, were not common enough, with- 
out any pigment filling. 

It is difficult to see how Miss Ruth 
Putnam's biography of Charles the 
Bold came to have a place in the 
"Heroes of the Nations" series (Putnam). The 
rash Duke was scarcely a hero, and, as the author 
correctly informs us, " he never had any nation, great 
or small, at his back. Personally he was a man with- 
out a country." The explanation in the preface, that 
the admission of Charles to this gi'oup " is justified 
by his relation to events," scarcely meets this objec- 
tion. But this is, after all, a minor matter. The 
important thing is that Miss Putnam has given us an 
interesting account of a most interesting career. The 
biography contains little that is new : we are still in 
the dark as to why Charles failed to get the royal 
crown at the meeting with the Emperor at Treves ; 
and there are other questions relating to the policies 
and diplomacy of the time that still remain unan- 
swered. But the story is told with a freshness that 
suggests a close study of primary sources and a 
mastery of available historic materials. The person- 
alities of Philip the Good, Charles the Bold, and 
Louis XL stand out clearly and prominently ; the 
complexities of the international situation in the 
second half of the fifteenth century are carefully 
traced; and the difficulties that the Burgundian 
dukes had to contend with in their effort to unify 
their numerous and diverse possessions are brought 
out in a very satisfactory manner. The four closing 
chapters are devoted to the trouble with the Swiss 
and with Lorraine, a difficulty which the author 
traces to a financial transaction of 1469, in which 
Sigismund of Austria mortgaged certain Alsatian 
possessions to Charles ; the manner in which these 
were administered, rather than Charles's ambitions 
with respect to the Alpine region, brought on the 
war with the mountaineers. The work is provided 
with numerous illustrations, all well executed and of 
true historic character. In addition it contains a 
fairly complete bibliography and a good map.

A volume of occasional addresses by Dr. W^illiam 
Osier, the Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, 
entitled " An Alabama Student and other Biographical 
Essays," will soon be published by the Oxford University 
Press. 

The " Physical Geography " of the late M. F. Maury, 
revised and largely re-written by Dr. Frederic W. 
Simonds, is published as a school text-book by the 
American Book Co. The text has been richly illus- 
trated and brought thoroughly up to date. 

A work on " Argumentation and Debating," by 
Professor William Trufant Foster, is published by 
Messrs. Houghton, Mifflin & Co. It is scientific in 
method, helpful in suggestion to the student, and fur- 
nished with illustrative exercises and examples. 

The recent ter-centennial celebration at Quebec gives 
special point to the publication of a History of Canada 
which the Macmillans are to bring out shortly. It will 
be a substantial work in three volumes, by Mr. Frank 
Basil Tracy, fully illustrated and well supplied with 
maps, etc. 

The Bibliography of Henry D. Thoreau, which will 
appear this Fall in Houghton Mifflin Co.'s series of 
bibliographies of standard authors, will contain a 
hitherto unpublished portrait of Thoreau, being a pho- 
togravure reproduction of a daguerreotype by R. D. 
Maxham of Worcester, taken in June, 1856. 

" Yolanda of Cyprus," a romantic drama by Mr. 
Cale Young Rice, is published by the McClure Co. 
Mr. Rice is one of the young writers who are gfiving 
new hope to students of American dramatic literature. 
Mr. Donald Robertson produced one of his plays last 
year, and promises another during the coming season. 

Dr. James D. Bruner's " Studies in Victor Hugo's 
Dramatic Characters," with an introduction by Dr. R. G. 
Moulton, makes a volume of deeply interesting literary 
criticism. The author calls his method one of " sym- 
pathetic induction," which is a fairly descriptive phrase. 
" Hernani," " Ruy Bias," and " Lucrezia Borgia " are 
the dramas which are the subjects of these studies. The 
book is published by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

" A Study of the Topography and Municipal History 
of Prseneste," by Mr. Ralph Van Deman Magaffin, is a 
recent addition to the Johns Hopkins studies in history 
and politics. To the Columbia series in philosophy and 
psychology has been added a treatise on "Time in 
English Verse Rhythm," by Dr. Warner Brown. A new 
number of the " Bulletin of the University of Texas " is 
devoted to "The Beginnings of Texas, 1684-1718," 
and is a doctoral dissertation by Mr. Robert Carlton 
Clark. 

A literary companion for the traveller in Greece is. 
provided by Mr. William Amory Gardner's " In Greece 
with the Classics," published by Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co. It is a volume of selections from the Greek 
poets and historians, topographically classified, repro- 
duced in new translations, and, in the case of the poetical 
passages, given also in the original text. Travellers 
will also find their account in two very companionable 
little books of poetry just published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. « The Poetic Old-World " is compiled by 
Miss Lucy H. Humphrey, and " Poems for Travellers " 



by Miss Mary R. J. DuBois. In Miss Humphrey's 
volume, the poems from foreign languages are given 
both in translation and in the original. This is a de- 
lightful book. 

Messrs. Frederick Wame & Co. will publish for the 
holidays a clever collection of colored pictures with 
accompanying Limericks, designed by Mr. Edmund 
Dulac. They have also in press a new children's book 
written and illustrated by Miss Beatrix Potter, author 
of the " Peter Rabbit " series, called " The Roly-Poly- 
Pudding," with full-page illustrations in color. The 
new volume for this year in the " Peter Rabbit " series 
for little children is entitled " The Tale of Jemima 
Puddle-Duck." 

It is announced that the authorized biography of 
Grover Cleveland is to be written by his friend, John 
Finley, President of the College of the City of New 
York. Mr. Finley asks that persons having letters or 
other memorials of Mr. Cleveland will kindly loan them 
to him for the purpose of the Biography. All manu- 
scripts will be promptly copied and the originals returned 
to the owner. Communications should be addressed: 
President John Finley, College of the City of New York, 
St. Nicholas Terrace, New York City. 

For many years people living in less favored com- 
mimities than San Francisco have heard rumors of 
strange and picturesque doings, called " Jinks," on the 
part of the Bohemian Club of that Western city. 
These affairs now have a historian (authorized by the 
Club ) in the person of Mr. Porter Garnett, whose book 
is entitled "The Bohemian Jinks," and may be had 
from Mr. A. M. Robertson as its publisher. The book 
makes very mteresting reading, and its charm is 
enhanced by the inclusion of a number of reveahng 
photographs. 

A volume of " Views and Reviews by Henry James " 
has been collected by Mr. LeRoy Phillips (to whom we 
owe the James bibliography), and is sent us by the Ball 
Publishing Co., Boston. Most of the contents are taken 
from early files of " The Nation," to which Mr. James 
was a frequent contributor. Among the subjects of these 
papers are George Eliot, Browning, Morris, Arnold, 
Dickens, Tennyson, and Mr. Swinburne. The closing 
paper, on " Mr. Kipling s Early Stories," provides a sort 
of connecting link between the present literary genera- 
tion and the last. Mr. James himself, of course, is one 
of the strongest of those links, and this unexpected 
addition to his available works gives us distinct cause 
for satisfaction. 

" The Humanists' Library," edited by Mr. Lewis 
Einstein and published by Mr. D. B. Updike of Boston, 
has reached its foiu-th volume, which contains Sir Philip 
Sidney's " Defence of Poesie." In an eloquent intro- 
duction. Professor George E Woodberry characterizes 
Sidney's tract as " the first classic — first both in time 
and in rank — of English criticism. ... In England 
humanism has no other monument so shining; neither 
has it any example so pure." The text of Dr. Ewald 
Fliigel's scholarly edition is used in this reprint, which 
has had the additional advantage of Dr. Fliigel's cor- 
rections in the proof. Besides the " Defence," we are 
given also Sidney's " Letter to Queen Elizabeth, per- 
swading Her not to Marry with the Duke of Anjou " 
(1580), and the " Discourse in Defence of the Earle of 
Leicester" (1584). A choicer offering to the lover of 
literature and beautiful book-making than this volume 
has not appeared in a long time.

ors, by Charles Copeland. 12mo. 
Price, $1.25. 

This book might very properly be 
called a companion volume to 
"Beautiful Joe," by the same 
author. Like that immensely pop- 
ular autobiography of a dog, this 
new work delineates animal life in 
a way that will fascinate and charm 
the children, and the hundreds and 
thousands of boys and girls who 
have come under the spell of Beau- 
tiful Joe's recital will be eager to 
read about the pets of the author of 
that " beautiful taleof an ugly dog."

In this very human and touching Christmas Story Dr. Knigrht has shown again the same qualities which made such a wide 
appeal to readers of "The Song of Our Syrian Quest"; sympathetic insight into human lives of all ages and races, tender 
sentiment, fresh power of interpretation, and delicate grace of expression.

THE STRANGE WAYS OF GOD 

A STUDY IN THE BOOK OF JOB 
By Charles Reynolds Brown 

Author of " The Main Points," " The 
Social Message of the Modern Pulpit," 
" Two Parables," " The Oospel of Good 
Health." 

Dr. Charles R. Brown believes that the 
teachings of the Book of Job have special 
value for our times, for it deals with the 
vital problems of ordinary people. He 
aims, therefore, to interest the average 
reader who is less concerned with dogmas 
and speculative inquiries than with the 
stress and strain of actual experience; 
and to clarify the complications of form 
in this ancient drama. 

Bound in green boards with buckram 
back, gilt top and lettering. 74 pages, 
5^A X 7% inches. 75 cents net. 



THE KEEN JOY OF UVING 
By John Edgrar Park 

It is not often that one encounters the 
sheer zest for living that bubbles up in 
these pages as from a perennial spring. 
The author is buoyantly glad to be alive, 
and to him life is a fine art to be produced 
from the raw materials at hand; it is a 
game to be entered with heart and soul ; a 
jest, sometimes, to the man who adds to 
faith, hope, and love, a sense of humor ; 
and, finally, a wondrous fairy tale. 

Attractively printed in two colors and 
bound in double folds, with end leaves 
and borders distinctive in character and 
very dainty in desigrn. Inclosed in an 
envelope, uniform in design and color. 
Beady for mailing. Size 7% x 4% inches. 
S5 cents net. 



OLD ANDOVER DAYS 

By Sarah Stuart Bobbins 
The book is written with a vivacity of 
style which would charm any reader who 
loves old times and old ways, but to one 
who knows Andover and the famous men 
and women of early days, it makes a pe- 
culiar appeal of its own. Many a delicious 
personal anecdote creeps in, and hardly 
a page but has its glint of quiet humor. 
This will surely take its place among the 
classic pictures of New England life. 

Bound in boards, with decorative side 
stamp and gilt top, deckle edges. Six full- 
page illustrations. 200 pages. $1.00 net. 

THE CHURCH OF TO-DAY 

By Joseph Henry Crooker 
The Church as an institution worthy of 
the support and loyalty of humanity is the 
theme of this inspiring book. It is a re- 
markably well written, well considered, 
well reasoned plea for the due apprecia- 
tion of the Church as an organization 
naturally fitted to meet human needs that 
are fundamental and universal ; an essen- 
tial factor in the corporate life of com- 
munities, and to-day not less but more 
needed than ever. 

Bound in green boards with buckram 
back, gilt top and lettering. 176 pages. 
5V4 X 7% inches. 75 cents net. 

THE LAND OF PURE DEUGHT 
By Bev. George A. Gordon, D.D. 

Starting with Isaac Watts's grand old 
hymn, " There is a land of pure delight," 
Dr. Gordon develops one of his most sin- 
cere and impressive talks on an inexhaus- 
tible theme. 

An exceedingly attractive little book, 
printed in two colors with delicate borders 
and decorations of green. The binding of 
double folded Sultan Damascus printed in 
gold bronze. Inclosed in an envelope uni- 
form in color and design. Ready for mail- 
ing. Size 7% X 4% inches. 35 cents net. 



The GOSPEL of GOOD HEALTH 

By Charles Reynolds Brown 

Author of "The Main Points," "The 
Social Message of the Modern Pulpit," 
"Two Parables," "The Strange Wav» 
of Ood." 

The cry of " Good Health for a dollar a 
bottle " is rapidly becoming a spent force. 
The cry of good health at the price of 
the cultivation and training of all one's 
powers, physical, mental, spiritual, by 
bringing them into joyous harmony with 
the revealed will of Gtod is now to the 
fore. And Dr. Brown's inspiring message 
is a fresh and genuine contribution to this 
subject. 

Beautifully printed in two colors and 
attractively bound. Inclosed in envelope 
uniform in color and design. Ready for 
mailing. Size 7% x 4% inches. 35 cents net. 



THE FACE ANGEUC 

By Hiram Collins Haydn 
In this choice little book Mr. Hadyn 
pays graceful tribute to the rare souls 
possessing this beauty of expression, from 
Moses and Stephen of Bible times to 
Abraham Lincoln and Margaret Ogilvy ; 
and goes on to show how the ordinary 
human being may realize the face angelic, 
" suggestive only of beautiful thoughts, 
transparent goodness, and heavenly tem- 
pers and aspirations." 

Harmoniously printed in a color scheme 
of buff and brown, with a cover of Univer- 
sity Text India, and a beautiful copy of 
Murine's famous Immaculate Conception 
as a frontispiece. Inclosed in an envelope 
uniform in color and design. Size 7% x 4%

Tells the story of the rise of biology from the renaissance of learning: to the present. It shows the shift in human opinion in

Bussia, and of other interesting first performances of " The Ring."

A PISGAH-SIGHT. 



In the last of his public addresses, Mr. 
Bronson Howard, the late dean of our Amer- 
ican guild of dramatic craftsmen, spoke of a 
visit he had recently made to Egypt, and his 
memories of deserts and temples provided him 
with a metaphor, which he shaped into a 
prophecy, concerning the future (►f the art to 
which he had given the best efforts of his long 
life. He spoke, in part, in the following words : 

" This future temple of the drama also arises in a 
desert— a dreary desert of English literature that covers 
the entire English-speaking world and stretches back 
more than half a century ; a desert of letters which has 
its own deceptions and optical illusions, making small 
men appear big and magnifying our great mien beyond 
their real greatness. It is a broad, flat desert of literary 
sage brush and scrub oak, with here and there a solitary 
mountain and a group of grand trees. But while there 
is in verity a temple arising in a place of desolation, I 
will venture on a cheerful prophecy. And mind you, 
even the weather reports are looked upon as prophecies. 
The brilliant indications shown by our younger writers 
for the stage who are now crowding to the front, eager, 
earnest, and persistent, with their eyes on the future 
and not the past, coming from every walk of life, from 
universities and all other sotirees of active thought, are 
the basis of my prophecy. It is this : In all human prob- 
ability the next great revival of literature in the English 
language will be in the theatre. The English-speaking 
world has been gasping for literary breath, and now we 
begin to feel a coming breeze. I may not live to fully 
enjoy it, but every man of my own age breathes the 
air more freely already. Let us hope that the drama 
of this century will yet redeem our desert of general 
literature. The waters of our Nile are rising." 

That this view of the promised land is some- 
thing more than the vision of a dreamer, we 
feel reasonably assured. The signs are multi- 
plying in many quarters that the long drought 
is nearly over, and that the desert region of our 
literature is about to be redeemed. To believe 
that it would ever remain a desert would be to 
reject every analogy drawn from history or from 
the contemporary literary activity of other coun- 
tries ; it would be to despair of the human mind. 
For all the teaching of history is that the drama 
is one of the five or six types of literary expres- 
sion fundamental to mankind, and that the 
creative powers of genius achieve their most 
complete satisfaction when they conceive of men 
and women as moving and acting and speaking 
upon the stage. That this mode of expression

should permanently cease to command the ener- 
gies of some, at least, of the richest and most 
powerfid minds engaged in the production of 
literature in any important country is a propo- 
sition as nearly unthinkable as any that could 
be formulated. That the practical drama should 
have lapsed from literary standards for so long 
as it has done in England and America is 
cause enough for wonder (although the reasons 
are fairly obvious), but is no cause for surrender 
of our faith in its coming rehabilitation. It 
must be a question of time only, and we cannot 
believe that the time will be long. 

It must not be forgotten that the last century, 
dark as it has been from the standpoint of well- 
wishers of the English theatre, has produced a 
memorable literature in dramatic form. That 
form has been used by Wordsworth, Coleridge, 
Byron, Keats, Shelley, Landor, Tennyson, 
Browning, Arnold, Swinburne, Longfellow, Poe, 
Aldrich, and many others. In fact, there are 
more of our greater poets who have used it than 
of those who have not. But, as we all know, 
most of them have used it in the " closet " way, 
without reference to the requirements of the 
real stage. They have given us everything of 
the drama but dramaturgy, and many of them 
would have given us that also had the public 
shown signs of encouraging them. The faculty 
that can create a dramatic action, and fit appro- 
priate words to the lips of the actors, has not 
been missing from English literature ; only the 
trick of technique has not been superadded, and 
this simply because there was no incentive for 
its acquisition. A public of which the most 
serious-minded section kept away from theatres 
altogether was not the sort of public to stimu- 
late a serious drama. 

We are well aware that there is a class of 
critics, devoted particularly to the drama, who 
are so enamored of technique that they will not 
admit a play unfit for the stage to be a play at 
all. They will doubtless take vehement excep- 
tion to the opinions above expressed, because 
they first give to dramatic technique the nar- 
rowest of definitions, and then upon that basis 
refuse admission into dramatic literature of all 
the works that do not conform to their defini- 
tion. But this is a quarrel about words merely. 
Because a work in dramatic form is not neatly 
divided into balanced and contrasted scenes, 
because its characters do not always make their 
entrances and exits in such a way as to produce 
certain momentary and artificial effects, because 
physical action is sometimes lost sight of in the 
development of ideas, because speeches are long 



and their language is not that of ordinary human 
intercourse, — for these and similar reasons we 
are assured that many of the noblest dramas in 
our literature are not really plays, but only 
academic exercises of which their authors should 
feel rather ashamed. These authors, we are 
told, have been too indolent to master the rules 
of stagecraft, and have assumed an unjustifiably 
irresponsible attitude toward the form of art in 
which they affect to work. 

Now all this may be measurably true, and yet 
it does not weaken our contention that the 
" closet drama " includes many works which, 
despite their failure to move at the nimble gait 
most pleasing to our feverish public of theatre- 
goers, are capable of fulfilling for serious audi- 
tors all the deeper purposes of dramatic art. 
'The technique which they lack, and for lack of 
which they are so roundly condemned, is just 
what we have called it, a trick, a comparatively 
superficial thing, a quality that the dramatic 
writer will do well to cultivate, but one that 
must not be permitted to absorb either his own 
faculties, or those of his audience, to the exclu- 
sion of those weightier matters for which the 
drama 'really exists. The authors of these very 
works of which we are speaking might easily 
enough have fitted their dramatic productions 
for the stage had they seen any indications of 
the existence of a receptive public. But from 
a public that did not go beyond technique in its 
demands, that even resented the drama of ideas 
and serious purpose, they naturally felt them- 
selves estranged. And the estrangement will 
continue as long as the public maintains its 
philistine attitude toward the stage. The " closet 
drama" is the logical result of that state of the 
public mind which even yet is disposed to apply 
the contemptuous epithet " problem plays " to 
all the works that go below the glittering sur- 
face of human nature, or that venture to sub- 
stitute poetry for sordid prose in their portrayal 
of life. 

It is safe to say that when the public is ready 
to give up thinking of a play as a mechanism, 
and is ready to recognize it as an organism 
instead, that the long-delayed rapprochement 
between English literature and the stage will be 
at hand. The gods are ready to arrive when the 
half -gods are cast from their shrines. The cidt 
of the artificial and the insincere, as typified by 
the Scribes and Sardous, must give place to the 
worthier form of worship exemplified, however 
faultily still, by those who have come to know 
the sincere truth-seeking aims of such men as 
Ibsen and Hauptmann and Maeterlinck and

Ecliegaray. Our examples are necessarily taken 
from foreign literatures because the English 
stage has so far lapsed from the path of drama- 
tic rectitude that it can offer only second-rate 
illustrations of even the inferior type. That 
regeneration of taste which alone can revive the 
past splendors of the English drama will come 
when enough people are brought to realize the 
simple fact that stares students of contemporary 
literature in the face, the fact that the English 
theatre stands alone among the theatres of the 
present-day world in its separation from reality 
and in its failure to give vital expression to the 
deeper thoughts and aspirations of the race. 

But there are signs of promise in the heavens, 
and the veteran playwright whose forecast has 
been taken as our text had his Pisgah- vision be- 
fore his eyes were closed. The Puritans frowned 
upon the stage, visiting their condemnation with- 
out discrimination upon good and bad alike, but 
their descendants are disposed to take a saner 
view and adopt a more liberal attitude. The 
church shows awakening sympathies and much 
softening of the old intolerance. Without the 
sympathy of the church, which in the old days 
saw in the drama the handmaid of religion, the 
outlook would be dark indeed. As Mr. Henry 
Arthur Jones pointed out a year or so ago, the low 
estate into which our acting drama has fallen is 
largely due to the hostile attitude of the religious 
public, an attitude inherited from seventeenth- 
century puritanism. With the chief agency of 
public morality alienated from its cause, the 
theatre inevitably came to represent the frivol- 
ous, if not the actually degenerate classes of 
society. But now the more liberal element of 
church-goers offers an olive branch to the ancient 
foe, and we have recently seen the appearance 
of an Actors' Church Alliance of national scope. 
Even in church circles of the severest standards 
there are signs of a new amity. Clergymen of 
imquestioned orthodoxy sometimes venture into 
the playhouse, and now and then bestow official 
sanction upon some play which exudes a suffi- 
cient amount of morality. These tentative 
efforts on the part of the clergy, despite their 
misplaced emphasis and their failure to make 
allowance for art in its proper sense, are never- 
theless encouraging, and are the first faltering 
steps toward a resumption of the cordial relations 
which are so greatly desirable. 

One swallow does not make a summer, and 
the winter of our dramatic discontent is likely 
to have its season prolonged for some time yet, 
but there is a clear harbinger of the coming 
spring in the extraordinary popular success of 



Mr. Kennedy's recent play. K a Work so gen- 
uinely artistic and at the same time so entirely 
wholesome as " The Servant in the House " can 
fill the playhouse for month after month with 
audiences that show every sign of being deeply 
moved by its gentle teaching, it is a pretty 
evident indication that a public already exists 
for work of a much more serious cast than that 
provided by our sordid syndicates. The public 
support that is slowly but surely bringing suc- 
cess to Mr. Donald Robertson's Chicago experi- 
ment in the higher drama, the practical interests 
that are soon to dedicate in New York a costly 
temple to sober dramatic art, the frequency with 
which good works are given special performances 
by our schools and universities, the marked de- 
velopment of student interest in dramatic liter- 
ature, the number of earnest young writers who 
are taking pen in hand with a fixed determina- 
tion to aid in the rehabilitation of that form of 
literature — these are among the signs of the 
coming revival. We cannot believe that a 
leaven working in so many ways will not soon 
have noticeable results, and will do much to 
justify the prophecy of the pioneer worker 
whose death we have lately been called upon to 
mourn. 



TOM HOOD AS A S ERIOUS POET. 

Posterity has not dealt justly with Tom Hood. 
In an age when minor Jacobeans of not half his 
merit are dug up and sent out into the world of 
letters, Hood is known only as a fellow of infinite 
jest, now musty, and a maker of innumerable puns 
which are no longer amusing. To be sure, his serious 
poems are still read ; indeed, new editions frequently 
appear ; but Hood remains among " those whom one 
should know about," not as a rival of Tom Moore, 
not as a child of Keats, but because he was the 
prince of punsters. 

Hood of " The Comic Annual " is dead for us. 
The light and airy wit that plays about the foibles 
of one generation loses its savor for the next. It is 
as alien as the fashions in illustrations of " Punch " 
or " Life " of twenty years back ; and, like them, it 
is grotesque. Hood the jester must go down the 
primrose path with Tarleton, with Scogan, and all 
those lesser humorists who dealt in the main with 
surface only. For punning, like euphuism, has lost 
its virtue, and can never secure a lasting reputation. 

Nor is it profitable to consider those humanitarian 
poems which made him famous among the serious- 
minded of the community. " The Song of the 
Shirt" will hold its place in the anthologies, and 
"The Bridge of Sighs," for all its word-juggling, 
will remain a great tour de force. Yet, in them 
Hood's trade, to sound the humor of the town, and 



200 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



Hood's talent, to play with words, are more evident 
than the man's real genius, a delicate flower at best, 
and, by the time these were written, nearly trampled 
out of him. One should not write of Hood without 
writing of his songs. But these deserve a special 
essay, and are not the matter for which we would 
challenge the readers who are content with the Hood 
of the anthologies. In defence of an attempt to bring 
a greater body of his verse back into the daylight, 
this might first be offered, — that he wrote verse of 
a certain kind which was not done so well before 
his time, or after it ; and that, laboring in part in 
their lifetime, he wrote a few poems to be ranked 
with the verse of the masters of a particular art. 
These masters were Keats and Coleridge. 

When the two Lake poets began the memorable 
venture of " The Lyrical Ballads," it was the part 
of Coleridge to reveal the beauty which lies in the 
weird, the supernatural, the regions at the borders of 
human experience. In " Christabel " and " The 
Ancient Mariner " he conveys, he suggests, by dic- 
tion and by metre, the tangible sensuous beauty of 
that which is intangible, unreal, and impossible. 
Byron's blaze to Coleridge's was a fierce lurid lamp- 
light to the intenser and clearer flame of alcohol. 

With Keats the vision is renewed. In "La Belle 
Dame sans Merci " there is the same crystallization 
of strange suggestions into beautiful and sensuous 
words. The penumbra of the world is made visible 
and can be apprehended by the senses as the 
penumbra of the sun at the time of total eclipse. 
Nor is the other poetry of Keats deficient in this 
quality. No mystic shadows of the other world are 
thrown off from the great odes. Hot sunlight, the 
intense heat of passion, the glory of the visible 
world, surcharge their lines ; but the same principle 
prevails. Beauty is made sensuous ; beauty of sight 
and sound and touch is transmuted into beauty of 
words. The poet turns from the spectral forest 
and the fire-flags of the upper air to embalmed 
darkness, and the Attic shape with brede of marble 
men and maids. But the beauty, whether of the 
weird or the natural world, is always sensuous. Its 
mystery and intensity is to be felt, not merely to be 
conceived of. Exquisite sequences of vowel sounds, 
words rich in connotation, rhythm that stirs the 
fancy, — all these bring upon the reader an enchant- 
ment of the senses identical with the spell cast by 
lovely seas, by wandering fires, by marble forms, or 
moonswept glades. 

This is the quality in which Keats and Coleridge 
are akin, and in which they excel. "Natural 
magic," Matthew Arnold, from another point of 
view, would call it. But whether one regards the 
result, the purpose, or the means, its appearance as 
a principal aim in verse is enough to establish a 
school of poetry. Shakespeare and Milton could 
make their lines become the thing described, but 
with them it was not the end and purpose of their 
work. Tennyson learned the art of Keats, but he 
too made it subordinate to other ends. Like his 
early work, in which this quality is strongest, is the 



poetry of the pre-Raphaelites. Yet their verse at 
its best lacks the final perfection and the freshness 
of the masters. But Hood is a generation earlier. 
He belongs with Keats and with Coleridge them- 
selves. He comes upon the crest of the wave, and 
if he never reached the fagry lands at least he sailed 
the perilous seas of romance with the first naviga- 
tors. Though a disciple, it is as a pioneer also that 
he deserves to be studied. 

The poems which Hood wrote in the school of 
Keats and Coleridge were nearly all composed before 
1829. Up to that time he was known only as an 
author of sound, though restricted, fame, who served 
upon the staff of the old " London Magazine " with 
such men as Barry Cornwall, Hartley Coleridge, 
Allan Cunningham, Hazlitt, De Quincey, and Lainb, 
as fellow contributors. From his " Literary Remin- 
iscences " (which deserve to be better known) one 
discovers that he came under the personal influence 
of the great men who helped to make a new literary 
period. He knew Wordsworth and Coleridge, and 
saw much of the latter. He may have known Keats ; 
for Mrs. Hood was a sister of Keats's friend Rey- 
nolds. Quotation, as well as imitation, show that at 
least he was steeped in his poetry. As a disciple, 
and also as a friend or acquaintance, he came into 
contact with most of the writers of the Wordsworth- 
Coleridge group. 

The greater part of Hood's serious work was done 
in the period of these friendships, when Lamb and 
he were still tramping country roads to sample tavern 
ales, while Keats was alive, or only recently dead, 
and before Coleridge had retired. But in 1830 he 
did his first comic annual, a compound of the humor- 
ous and a masterpiece of punning. The public 
laughed, were rewarded with more, and paid well 
for it. Not that Hood was commercialized. One 
could have as easily commercialized Keats. No, — 
he was married. The portrait of Mrs. Hood at the 
National Gallery is very surprising; she is so stiff, 
so aristocratic, so unemotional. One wonders to see 
thus presented the Fanny loved by Hood with a pas- 
sionate devotion as full of sentiment at the end as 
at the beginning. It was this marriage, seemingly, 
which made most of the trouble. For in 1834 busi- 
ness troubles involved the Hoods ; and the poet, refus- 
ing bankruptcy, went abroad where he might live 
cheaply and so save enough to support his family. 
Serious poems were not an asset of sufficient magni- 
tude to interest a creditor ; but the people labelled 
him prime humorist, and would buy his humor at 
sight. For many years he could afford to write 
nothing else ; and thus began the long struggle in 
which, worn out, he died. All this explains why we 
deal in the main with youthful work when we speak 
of the serious poems of Thomas Hood. Perhaps if 
Keats had married Fanny Brawne when he first met 
her he would have returned to surgery and left us 
only " Endymion " and " Calidore." 

The serious work of Tom Hood for which one 
could ask a hearing is of three sorts. There are the 
romantic narratives and the odes of the school of 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



201 



Keats ; there are poems of horror, fear, and mystery, 
in the Coleridgean art ; and finally come the ballads 
in the manner of " Christabel " and " The Ancient 
Mariner." 

The most ambitious and the least successful of 
the poems of the first variety was " The Plea of the 
Midsummer Fairies." There is a faint but peculiar 
charm in this poem. It is like Italian Asti, delicate, 
memorable, a little weak, and a little cloying. One 
feels throughout the presence of a spirit too like the 
pleading Titania, whose arguments are not strong 
enough to save her realms from Father Time. It is 
Keats and Spenser drained of their virility, although 
the poet is quite as careful of the beautiful words 
that stir the mind to dreams. The faults of youth 
mar other narrative poems of Hood's, notably the 
better known "Hero and Leander." But though not 
entirely free from them, it is difficult to see why 
" Lycus the Centaur " has been so completely for- 
gotten. Its theme alone should have saved it, for 
the story of the enchantments of Circe is told in a 
strikingly original fashion. The tale could have 
been told severely with aU the horror implied, and 
so Landor might have written it ; but Hood chose a 
highly-colored narrative in which the shame of men 
turned brutes, the horror of Lycus wandering in a 
land where beasts and even fruit and flowers imprison 
woeful souls, his agony when his own spirit is chained 
to the loathsome body of a horse, all find expression 
and suggestion in rich verse. The poet is preemi- 
nently a lover of beautiful words ; and yet in spite 
of an occasional absurdity, he is no less a master of 
the pathos which lay behind his humor and crystal- 
lized in the humanitarian poems of his later life. 

A group of odes belong with these poems. The 
very titles, " Ode on Autumn," " Ode to Melancholy," 
"Ode to the Moon," show the influence of Keats. 
Less fervid than the master's work, they strive for 
the same effects, but in Hood's own way. The 
gentle melancholy of the " Plea " breathes through 
them. Ecstasy gives place to sadness. The rap- 
turous grasp upon beauty becomes a softer longing, 
as genuine but less intense. They are more re- 
strained than the narrative poems, more indicative 
of what the poor hack might have done if fate had 
let him. The deliberate richness of their phrase 
makes one sigh for a craftsman tirrned from such 
gold to a baser metal. 

" Mother of light ! how fairly dost thou go 
Over those hoary crests, divinely led ! 

The " Ode to Melancholy " is less happy than this 
ode to the moon, whose ensuing verses are even 
more exquisite ; but " Autumn " is magnificent. It 
is a companion piece to Keats's poem, and should so 
be read. Upon it alone one might base a claim for 
verse certainly as worthy as some of Tennyson's 
before the problems of the nineteenth century 
entered into his poetry. But when age had mel- 
lowed Hood, a barren decade of hack-labor had 
followed his inspiration. This diction is from his 
youth : 



'■ Where is the Dryad's immortality ? 
Gone into mournful cypress and dark yew, 
Or wearing the long, gloomy winter through 
In the smooth holly's green eternity." 

But horror and mystery can be conveyed by the 
suggestive power of words, as well as melancholy 
can. " Lycus " is a lament over wretchedness, a 
weird wretchedness like that of " The Ancient 
Mariner." In two or three other poems Hood passes 
over entirely into the manner which Coleridge made 
his own ; and these pieces make up the second class 
of his serious poetry. One of these poems pleased 
Browning, but has attained no other fame. In " The 
Haunted House " the horror is vague, the fear only 
suggested. Like Shelley's "Sensitive Plant," the 
piece is only a description. The tragedy must be 
apprehended from the house which conceals it, as 
the romance of Venice from a painting of Turner's. 
Over a ruin hangs the mystery of the Bloody Hand 
which appears on tattered banners, on curtains, and 
on broken casements. Not a tumbled coping-stone, 
not a wood-louse, spider, or moth, within the cor- 
roded walls, but is drawn upon for its share of 
suggested decay. And at proper intervals comes 
the refrain, " O'er all there hung the shadow of a 
fear." The fashion of telling is Hood's, for the 
poem is late ; but the power of the story is in its 
metre and in its diction, and these most resemble 
the style of " The Ancient Mariner." 

Yet there is no servile imitation in this poem, nor 
in the almost famous " Dream of Eugene Aram " 
which belongs with it. Tom Hood is strongly 
original in both ; but the mantle of Coleridge has 
fallen upon his shoulders. He is imitative mainly 
in the endeavor to transmute the feeling of mystery 
and of fear, and of deeds terribly done, into sound 
and picturing word. Agony of conscience drives 
Eugene Aram to tell a schoolboy a pretended dream 
which is a true recital of his murder of an old man. 

" And lo ! the universal air 
Seemed lit with ghastly flame ; 
Ten thousand thousand dreadful eyes 
Were looking down in blame : 
I took the dead man by his hand, 
And called upon his name ! " 

"The Ancient Mariner " achieves its peculiar effects 
by like cunning of words and metre. But few men 
have been able to give a better example than Hood 
in " Aram " of the proper relation between pupil 
and master. The imitation is of methods and of 
purpose, more than of diction, metre, or thought. 
The inspiration is not so much borrowed as shared. 
A critic of Hood, in " The Edinburgh Review " 
of April, 1846, remarked that " he could throw 
himself back into the romance of the past, but his 
home was naturally among the realities of the 
present." The present of 1846 has long gone by, 
and with it most of the work of the poet which 
dealt with topics current in that day. Of his " con- 
temporary problem " poetry, only " The Song of the 
Shirt " has lasted. But there is at least one poem 
of "the romance of the past" which is likely to 



202

endure. " Fair Ines " is one of several attempts 
in his third or ballad manner, the manner of 
" Christabel " and " La Belle Dame sans Merci." 
The verse which enshrines her is full of the quaint 
and exquisite charm of high romance. The very 
flower of romance is in such work, — romance like 
that which Scott conceived, but could give us only 
in the large, striving in broad strokes to achieve it 
by the very size of his canvas. In the poems of 
Keats and Coleridge, and to a less extent in these 
ballads of Hood, it finds an embodiment which may 
be likened to the masterpieces of the early Flemish 
painters, in whose pictures the mediaeval world is a 
vivid reality. Yet it may be likened to them only 
in the vividness of the impression gained ; for in 
these poems the glamor, seen only by a modern, hangs 
over the picture. One looks at the past as at Tintern 
Abbey, without reflection, without thorough compre- 
hension, yet stirred by the romance of its memories. 
Perhaps no one but a grim realist will deny this 
power to the best poems of the masters. But Hood 
too saw the vision. Hood shared the *' wild sur- 
mise " of the first moderns to stare upon the for- 
gotten middle ages through the haze of romance. 
He also, in his minor way, could bring down this 
romance from the ethereal and make it concrete. 
" Fair Ines " is surcharged with it. 

'• I saw thee, lovely Ines, 
Descend along the shore, 
With bands of noble gentlemen, 
And banners waved before."' 

One cannot read this exquisite poem without a male- 
diction upon punning, and the fate that made its 
author devote such powers to the manufacture of 
comic annuals. 

It is this reflection which makes it difficult to 
estimate the value of Tom Hood's work ; for, after 
all, it was only half done. Hounded by misfortune 
and betrayed by the facility of his humor, he made 
himself famous, it seems, at the expense of becoming 
great. It is useless to guess what was Achilles' 
name among the women, or what Keats would have 
written had he lived ; but here is a minor Keats 
whose ambition to leave great verse unto a little clan 
was not stout enough to endure. He had the ability 
to carry on the school of his masters. His humor 
would have saved him from the morbid sensuality 
which always threatened the pre-Raphaelites. His 
vigor, and the close relation which his life ever bore 
to the best thought of his time, might have impelled 
him from the parent source along a channel as orig- 
inal as Tennyson's. But this is pure speculation, 
and too much resembles an attempt to drag him from 
among the minor poets, where he belongs. The 
best service we can render Tom Hood is to rake 
back the ashes from the coals of live fire still glow- 
ing in his verse. Surely, for his own sake and for 
the sake of the school he wished to follow, the 
unhappy humorist deserves that the fate his own 
sonnet forebodes — " there may be then no resur- 
rection in the minds of men " — shall not be Tom 
Hood's. Henry Seidel Canbv. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

Misquotations of poetry, as has been remarked 
before in these columns, are too common to be noted, 
except in some peculiarly shocking cases by way of 
warning and example. Such an instance occurs in 
a recent number of that usually well-edited and 
always interesting London journal, " The Nation," 
where (No. 20, p. 707) a poetically-minded contrib- 
utor presents an amusing and amazing sheaf of short 
quotations from standard English poetry, chosen to 
illustrate his notion (a somewhat fanciful one, it 
would appear) of passages '' most descriptive of vari- 
ous personal or social conditions." It may seem 
presumptuous that anything emanating from the 
centre and stronghold of English culture should be 
challenged from this remote literary frontier, where — 
as readers of English journals and books of travel 
are aware — pig-sticking rather than literature is the 
usual pursuit of the inhabitants, and " the ambushed 
Indian and the prowling bear " are likely to be 
encountered anywhere outside the city limits. Yet 
we make bold to say that such a garbling of passages 
of well-known poetry as appears in this scholarly 
English journal is enough to abash the ambushed 
Indian, or make the pig-sticker blush for his literary 
heritage. In a couple of lines from one of Long- 
fellow's most familiar poems, '• The Rainy Day," we 
count seven words printed wrong — seven out of 
fifteen I " Surely we were never reminded better," 
remarks the contributor, " of a hopelessly wet day." 
It was indeed a wet day — for him ! Perhaps in 
Aberdeenshire, from whence he writes, both the day 
and the quotation appeared through a mist of Scotch 
whiskey. And if he is a Scotchman, he should know 
his Burns well enough to understand the difference 
between higs (ears) and lungs; but he seemingly 
does not, or he would not change the line " And 
through my lugs gies mony a twang " to make the 
lungs the region of the poet's toothache. A misprint 
of a single letter may be thought a trivial matter, — 
but not when the line is from Keats, whose " beaded 
bubbles winking at the brim " are changed to '' headed 
bubbles," as though the " blushful Hippocrene " had 
been transmuted into lager beer. And this, the col- 
lector fatuously explains, is one of " the best quoted 
lines in the English language "; but in his hands it 
certainly seems one of the worst quoted. He does 
it again, to the same poet, in the opening line of 
" The Eve of St. Agnes," 

" St. Agnes' Eve, — ah, bitter chill it was ! " 
which is thus rendered by our connoisseur of poetic 

gems : 

" At Agnes Eve, and bitter chill it was." 

No T^onder he adds, " Does not this make you 
shiver ? " It does indeed.

that ancient vehicle little familiar to other American 
cities, and passing into innocuous desuetude even in 
Boston — in his business hours, and enjoys the 
companionship of his books in his hours of leisure. 
'* Seated in his comfortable rocker," says the visitor 
to whom we are indebted for an account of this 
remarkable Jehu and his library, " I glanced around 
the little room with its slanting roof, and met hun- 
dreds of books, and the books returned the glance. 
Everywhere were books lined up in proper order, 
filling all available space from the floor to the ceil- 
ing, in neat cases and shelves, the ends of some of 
the latter cut short, one below another to conform to 
the pitch of the roof." Of the biographical section 
of this attic library, he says : "■ Therein you could 
I'ead the story of the men who made Greece and 
Rome famous, those who played a part in early 
Christian days ; the men, too, of France and Spain 
and Russia. With these you could find the well- 
known statesmen of England from her earliest days ; 
and there. I suppose the most cherished of all, were 
the lives of Ireland's noted ones." The Irish owner 
of these literary treasures has thriven moderately in 
his chosen calling, and having no family he has 
spent in books what others of his occupation squan-

BooK-coLLECTixci AS AN AVOCATION can become 
as fascinating, and also as expensive, as (let us say) 
ballooning or aeroplaning. The recent death of 
Mr. E. Dwight Church, owner of the finest private 
collection of Americana in the world, and also owner 
of one of the choicest collections of Elizabethan and 
early seventeeth-century literature, brings to public 
notice some of the rare and costly treasures of his 
fine library at Brooklyn, where he made his home. 
Soda-manufacture was Mr. Church's prosaic money- 
making vocation, that being his father's occupation 
before him; but the unrealized artistic aspirations 
of his youth found some measure of solace in what 
is surely next door to a fine art, book- collecting. 
To illustrate his indefatigable zeal as a collector, it 
may suffice to mention here that he possessed the 
only known and long sought for copy of the first 
printed collection of Massachusetts Laws, which was 
only recently discovered in England. The old- 
fashioned title is interesting: "The Book of the 
General Lawes and Libertys concerning the Inhab- 
itants of the Massachusetts collected out of the 
Records. Cambridge : Printed according to the 
Order of the General Court, and are to be solde at 
the shop of Hezekiah Usher in Boston. 1648." His 
New England Primers included four unique copies 
— the Boston editions of 1735, 1738, 1746, and 
1762 — and his Shakespeareana embraced fifteen 
different copies (that is, with variations in the im- 
print) of the four first folios. The first part of an 
illustrated and annotated catalogue of Mr. Church's 
library has been prepared by Mr. George W. Cole 
and published by Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. 



Education by syndication is hardly to be ap- 
prehended ; there is not enough money in it. The 
General Education Board, however, with its com- 
mand of $43,000,000 in funds, is in a position to 
exercise great influence on the character of Amer- 
ican education ; and it is both a gi'and and a peril- 
ous power for any one body of men to possess. 
Anything like centralization or monopoly in educa- 
tion is of course extremely undesirable ; anything 
that tends to supplant or diminish local enterprise 
and local pride in the matter of public education is 
to be dreaded. State rights and town rights are to 
be jealously guarded where culture is concerned, no 
less than in matters more material and tangible. 
Cheerful local support of good schools will cease if 
the people ever get the notion that a great educa- 
tional trust is looking after such interests and 
paying the bills. Already, in the very state of 
Massachusetts, the board of trustees of the Agricul- 
tural College at Amherst has been directed by the 
legislature " to use its best efforts to secure and 
accept for the college the benefit of the retiring fund 
of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teachers." The opening of the school year moves 
to reflections and apprehensions, however full of 
promise and bright hope may be the general condi- 
tion of our educational system.

The blind poet of Maryland, the Rev. John 
Banister Tabb of St. Charles's College at EUicott 
City, the " Father " Tabb so well known for his 
pithy bits of verse in many of the leading periodi- 
cals, has, like Milton, been stricken with blindness 
in the vigor of his manhood ; but, unlike Milton, he 
has no daughters to read to him and otherwise 
lighten the burden of his affliction. He writes that 
vision is nearly extinguished, but that he remains at 
the college for the present, not as a guest of honor, 
as his colleagues would fain have him do, but as a 
paying boarder, this arrangement being permitted 
only because he would seek another home if he 
could not have his way. The many who have found 
spiritual refreshment and intellectual delight in his 
crisply characteristic verse will, it is hoped, feel 
impelled to testify their appreciation by extending 
a helping hand to the stricken poet in his hour of 
need. Even a small offering from each of the un- 
known friends he has made could not fail to bring 
him cheer and comfort. Perhaps, too, the offerings 
had better be anonymous, to prevent their prompt 
return on the part of so sturdily independent a man. 
He is not, however, an object of charity ; rather has 
he made us his debtors.

The short story of action is no longer written,

that is all. Nothing done, nothing doing I The 
characters breathe, they think, but how seldom, oh, 
how seldom, they act ! " The importance attached 
to action in fiction, by this writer, is like the import- 
ance given to it in oratory by Demosthenes ; and, 
surely, in an era so full of action as ours, so rich in 
discoveries and inventions, so crowded with multi- 
farious callmgs and pastimes, it is strange that the 
story-writer should want for incident wherewith to 
enliven his tale. In the latest London directory 
some hundred or more new trades and professions 
are noted; and the activities of men (and women) 
are increasing by a sort of geometrical progression. 
Why, then, this dearth of action in the short story ? 
May it not be because, after all, it is the old, old 
story of the heart and its affections that we are for- 
ever craving to hear retold ? Scenery and events, 
given the artist of genius, need never be elaborate or 
startling. There are but seven possible plots in 
fiction, it has been asserted ; but those seven plots, 
like the seven days of the week, contain infinite 
possibilities. 

The story of Dickens's first love is some- 
what fully told in a collection of the novelist's letters 
now first made public, in a limited way, through the 
generosity of Mr. William K. Bixby, the St. Louis 
bibliophile and collector. By Mr. Bixby's kindness 
the members of the Bibliophile Society are in pos- 
session of the first and only printed copies of these 
inevitably interesting love-letters, which for three- 
quarters of a century have been hidden to the world, 
although the world has known of their existence 
from Forster's " Life of Dickens." The Dora of 
" David Copperfield " and the Flora of " Little 
Dorrit " now prove to be Miss Maria Beadnell, 
afterward Mrs. Henry Winter, of real life. It is 
a little amusing, and thoroughly natural, to find 
the young lover writing to Maria in 1833, less 
than three years before his marriage to Catherine 
Hogarth : "I never have loved and I never can 
love any human creature breathing but yourself." 
Twelve years passed before the coldly responsive 
maiden bestowed her virgin affections on Henry 
Louis Winter, a business man in comfortable cir- 
cumstances. A preface to the letters has been writ- 
ten by Mr. Henry H. Harper of the Society, and a 
critical analysis is contributed by Professor George 
Pierce Baker of Harvard.

A CASE OF POETIC JUSTICE in our colonial history 
was surely the well-deserved fate that overtook 
General Braddock in his foolishly conducted expe- 
dition across the Alleghanies against Fort Duquesne. 
After his supercilious rejection of the venerable 
Franklin's advice in the matter of safeguarding his 
force against the Indians, his disregard of the warn- 
ings of his young but experienced staff-officer 
George Washington, and his pompous assertion of 
the invincible superiority of British regulars, it 
seemed no more than right that he should have 
personal experience of the red man's vigilance and 



cunning. But now, if we are to believe the plausi- 
ble story of Mr. Albert Stewart of Washington, 
Braddock was killed, not by the redskins, but by a 
white man of his own force. Mr. Stewart's grand- 
father, Abram Stewart, was superintendent of the 
road travelled by Braddock's army on that disastrous 
day ; and it was while the superintendent was 
directing some repairs on this highway, about eight 
miles east of Uniontown, Pa., that there suddenly 
appeared from the bushes one Thomas Fossett, a 
deer-hunter of local repute, who told the workmen 
that if they dug deeper they would unearth the body 
of General Braddock. They digged, and found the 
body, which was later reburied near by, the grave 
being now marked with a tablet. The manner of 
the general's death was then explained by Fossett, 
who declared that he himself had shot his comman- 
der with his deer rifle. Braddock, conceited and 
arrogant, ignorant of Indian tactics, and insisting 
upon marshalling his force in the open, had taken 
occasion to upbraid Fossett, who, with his brother, 
was busily engaged in picking off the enemy from 
the shelter of trees, the regidars being thrown into 
confusion and bewilderment by the unfamiliar strat- 
egy of their foes. The unjust rebuke administered 
to Fossett so angered him that he fired on Braddock, 
and saw him fall, mortally wounded. This story, 
if true, is an interesting footnote to the history of 
our French and Indian wars. 



The pedantry of legax language both amuses 
and irritates the layman whenever he has occasion 
to wade through the verbiage of a legal document. 
What could be more pompously pleonastic than, for 
example, the terms of a lease whereby A. B. " hath 
demised, granted, and leased, and by these presents 
doth demise, grant, and lease, unto C. D., his exec- 
utors, administrators, and assigns, all that messuage 
and lot of ground situate, lying, and being " within 
certain laboriously designated boundaries ? Let it 
be remembered, too, what an amount of impatience 
and harrowing suspense the circumlocutions of a 
man's last will and testament are responsible for 
among his heirs-expectant, assembled to hear the 
reading of that formidable document. Instead of 
saying simply and directly, " I give my old friend 
Joe Appletree my Squirrel Hill wood-lot," the de- 
ceased, or his lawyer for him, has been obliged to 
write : " As to my worldly estate, and all the prop- 
erty, real, personal, or mixed, of which I shall die 
seized and possessed, or to which I shall be entitled 
at the time of my decease, I devise, bequeath, and 
dispose thereof in the manner following to wit: , 
Unto my old and valued friend, Joseph Appletree, 
I give, devise, and bequeath "the above-named wood- 
lot, so disguised in its opulence of legal jargon that 
honest Joe is puzzled to determine whether he has 
fallen heir to a county or a cabbage-patch. Accuracy 
in language is one thing ; senseless redundancy is 
another. The reform in legal terminology that has 
begun in France might well extend to England and

ing the ancient reproach that the law is mainly 
concerned with elucidating the obvious, proving the 
self-evident, and expatiating on the commonplace.

" Baths before kooks " is said to be the motto 
of Superintendent Maxwell of the New York City 
public schools. " As I draw books myself from a 
Carnegie library," he declares, " and watch the 
children of the public schools go there for reading 
matter, I bless the great iron master for what he has 
done for the intellectual improvement and recreation 
of this city ; and yet the usefulness, from a moral 
and hygienic point of view, of the Carnegie libraries 
is small compared with the advantages that would 
flow from the benevolence of him who shall increase 
the number of public school baths." Perhaps it is 
well for the bookish person to be occasionally thus 
reminded that there are other m'gent needs besides 
the intellectual ones, and that literature can bake 
no bread any more than can philosophy. Cleanli- 
ness, if it falls somewhat short of godliness, may be 
allowed to go ahead of book-learning. The frequent 
union, by the way, of bookworminess (if the term 
may be permitted for the sake of its expressiveness) 
and personal slovenliness is one of the less pleasing 
manifestations of the literary temperament — one of 
the less encouraging outgro^\'ths or accompaniments, 

too, of the library habit.

The coast of Bohemia was, we believe, some 
time ago proved to be no such impossible region as 
modern geographers, in their pride of a fancied 
superiority to Shakespeare, are fond of believing. 
Was it Sir Edward Sullivan, or an earlier inquirer, 
who so happily discovered that under the rule of 
Ottocar the Second (1255-1278) Bohemia extended 
from the confines of Bavaria to Raab in Hungary, 
and from the Adriatic to the Baltic Sea ? As there 
is no reason whatever why Polixenes should be 
assumed to have reigned contemporarily with 
Elizabeth, so there is no reason to refuse to the 
Bohemia of " The Winter's Tale " the ample bounds 
of its thirteenth-century prosperity. Yet malicious 
allusions to Shakespeare's " Coast of Bohemia " will 
probably be made to the end of time, so prone is 
frail human nature to strive for an easy eminence 
by demonstrating some minor inferiority in the 
great. It was a chance reference to this Bohemian 
question in our reading that prompted the foregoing 
protest against setting down Shakespeare as an 
ignoramus in geogi'aphy.

Stay-at-home travel, by the ever-popidar 

Public Library Route, is inexpensive, does not 
interfere with one's business or one's family duties, 
offers a practically unlimited choice of itineraries, 
combines unexampled speed with absolute safety, 
and, for comfort, is incomparably the best known 
method of visiting all parts of the world. To be 
sure, it is not without some few disadvantages ; for 
example, consumptive patients visiting Colorado by 



this route are not likely to derive that benefit from 
the high and dry air of the Rocky Mountains which 
may be gained by one who travels by the Union 
Pacific or the Denver and Rio Grande. But there 
are stay-at-home cures for consumption, too ; or so 
we are assured every little while by the newspapers. 
The latest report of the Galesburg (111.) Public 
Library tells us that so fond are the Galesburgians 
of stay-at-home travelling that, while there has been 
an increase in circulation in every department of 
literature, the demand for books of travel in the 
past year has doubled. It wonld be interesting to 
know if a similar growth has been noted by other 
librarians. ... 

Novel-reading and longevity stand in no 
very obvious relation to each other ; yet at the recent 
convention of the English Library Association at 
Brighton, in a spirited discussion of the question how 
far public libraries should go in the purchase of 
current fiction, Sir William Bailey of Manchester 
made bold to affirm, amid cries of incredulity, that 
the library authorities of his city very seldom found 
a novel that was objectionable, and even went so far 
as to declare his opinion that the reading of fiction 
prolonged the lives of many people. This assertion 
was gi'eeted with laughter, but it is not reported 
that anyone made the obvious and not especially 
original retort that the reading of our great mass of 
current novels does not really prolong life — it only 
makes it seem longer.

ALDRICH'S "COLLECTED" POEMS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

May I, as the authorized biographer of the late 
Thomas Bailey Aldrich, call attention to what seems to 
me a breach of publishing propriety in a volume entitled 
" Poems of Thomas Bailey Aldrich," just issued ? This 
volume, which is announced by its publishers as " a new 
collected edition," is composed of the contents of five of 
Aldrich's first six volumes of verse, all written before he 
was thirty years old. It contains 152 pieces, of which 
121 were discarded by the poet from his own collected 
editions, the " Household " and the " Riverside," while 
of the 31 pieces that were retained by him, the text of 
many has been so thoroughly revised that the earlier 
and cruder forms are scarcely recognizable by those who 
have known them in later and legitimate editions. There 
are in Aldrich's collected Poetical Works 230 poems. 
There are, therefore, 199 of these, embodying the poet's 
most mature and finest work, not to be foimd in this 
" new collected edition," — though the publishers have 
made amends for this deficiency by printing several 
pieces twice. 

The ethical question of the right of such a piece of 
book-making to masquerade as a "new collected edition," 
I do not raise; but as to the propriety of representing, 
without explanation or apology, the most fastidious of 
American poets by a compilation of his discarded juve- 
nilia, there can be, I think, no two minds.

Fifty Years of Music and Musicians.* 

" I dedicate these memories to the ghosts," 
is the short but significant inscription preceding 
the " Musical Memories " of that veteran critic 
of music, and author of well-known books about 
music and musicians, Mr. George P. Upton. 
The " Memories " relate to those stars, of vari- 
ous magnitudes, and now chiefly extinct, that 
were in their glory on the operatic stage and in 
the concert haU in the latter half of the nine- 
teenth century, and that cast some rays of their 
effulgence on the Chicago of that period. Mr. 
Upton was for twenty-five years music critic, 
and later editorial writer, on the staff of the 
Chicago " Tribune." He has concerned him- 
self actively and intimately with the musical 
interests of the city, and has enjoyed more or 
less friendly relations with a host of famous 
musicians and singers and impresarios, from the 
time when, in the early fifties, he left his native 
Boston and cast in his lot with the prairie city 
so largely colonized by Boston people and built 
with Boston capital. From a rich collection of 
notes and records, concert programmes and 
newspaper notices, as well as from remembered 
conversations and events, he has written a book 
of unusual interest to those of his own com- 
munity, and hardly less attractive to music- 
lovers and readers generally. Jenny Lind is 
the subject of his first chapter, and Theodore 
Thomas figures in his closing pages ; while 
between these two there parades so splendid a 
pageant of musical genius that one is almost 
deceived into believing that Chicago, and not 
Boston or New York or Cincinnati or New Or- 
leans, was the music centre of America. 

Although Jenny Lind never visited Chicago, 
notwithstanding assertions to the contrary, the 
author's vivid recollections of her appearance 
at Providence, where he was then a freshman 
in Brown University, are graphically recorded. 

" At last the eventful night came — October 7, 1850, — 
a red-letter date in memory. The usually staid city 
was in a state of delirium, which astonished those con- 
servative old families — the Iveses, Browns, Goddards, 
and Hoppins. I can see it all now — the crowds, the 
enthusiasm, the great audience inside, and the vastly 
greater crowd outside wishing it were inside. I see 
Jenny Lind gliding down the stage with consummate 
grace, — she never seemed to walk, — amid the accla- 
mations of the audience; a girlish figure of medium 
height, with fair hair and blue eyes, gowned in velvet,

and wearmg a single rose in her hair. She was plain 
of feature, and yet her face was expressive and in a 
sense fascinating. It was a wholesome face. She may 
not have been beautiful, judged by the conventional 
beauty tests; but if not extremely good-looking, she 
' looked good,' as some one has said. And that good- 
ness drew everyone to her, and she was ' Jenny ' with 
everyone — not Signora Lind, or Mademoiselle Lind, 
or Miss Lind, but Jenny Lind, as we say Annie Gary 
or Lilli Lehmann. Her voice, as I remember it, was of 
full volume and extraordinary range, and had a peculiar 
penetrating quality also, because of its puritj', which 
made its faintest tone clearly audible and enabled her 
to use exquisitely soft pianissunos. Her high notes were 
as clear aa a lark's, and her full voice was rich and 
sonorous. Her singing was genial and sympathetic 
and marked by the fervor and devotional quality which 
characterized her nature. It evinced a noble musical 
endowment and great reverence for her art. She was 
little affected by adulation, but acknowledged the wild, 
frantic applause courteously and with evident pleasure." 

Reminiscences of the Patti brothers and 
sisters, an extraordinarily gifted octette, afford 
matter for more than one chapter. Adelina, " the 
most consummate and brilliant singer of her 
time," and " unrivalled in roles requiring gmce, 
elegance, and ornate vocalization," Mr. Upton 
did not become personally acquainted with ; but 
the following explanation of her success in resist- 
ing the ravages of time may be taken as author- 
itative. 

" She apparently knew the secret of perpetual youth, 
for to the very last of her stage appearances she seemed 
to be the Patti of the olden days, fresh, young, and 
charming. When she was sixty-four, she told a friend 
that up to the time she was forty she ate and drank 
what she pleased, but after that followed a stricter 
regime, never touching liqueurs or spirits, but limiting 
herself to white wine diluted with soda, eschewing heavy 
food, and sleeping with open windows but avoiding 
draughts. In this way she had preserved her youthful 
appearance. She had preserved her voice so long by 
her perfect Italian method and avoidance of exposure, 
and by never forcing it." 

It was from Ole Bull, we are told, that Adelina 
learned the trick of farewelling. He was wont 
to give plain farewells, "grand" farewells, 
" last " farewells, " absolutely last " farewells, 
and " positively last " farewells, blithely reap- 
pearing the next season, until he bade farewell 
to earth and was seen no more. 

An occasional whimsical or humorous fancy 
is allowed by the writer to give variety to his 
narrative. After chronicling the death of 
Wieniawsky, the violinist, in poverty brought 
on by gambling, he continues : 

« I have often wondered why it is that the violins 
gamble so frequently. I cannot recall violas, 'cellos, 
or double-basses doing it. I am quite certain the trom- 
bone never loses money by chance, and that the bassoon, 
clarinet, and trumpet never take risks in any kind of 
game. But I know of several violinists who every now 
and then have * gone broke.' Is it because the violins

alone of the orchestral family have all the wild, way- 
ward, passionate work to do, and the other instruments 
have more staid, dignified, and conservative duties to 
perform ? " 

Rubinstein's piano-playing greatly impressed 
the author, who thought the famous musician 
best in concertos, where " by his titanic power 
and impulsive force he not only made his piano 
take its proper place in the sea of sound, but he 
fairly led the orchestra in an authoritative man- 
ner. In a word, he dominated audience, players, 
and sometimes conductors." He was an artist 
who belonged to no school and left no school, 
but was a great musician playing Rubinstein. 
Not exactly gratifying to national pride, but 
still not without a crumb of comfort, is the 
following : 

" It is somewhat strange, considering his great suc- 
cess and the large remuneration he received, that he 
was dissatisfied with his American tour, with the busi- 
ness arrangements, and with piano-playing altogether. 
It is a little consoling, however, to know that he disliked 
England more than he did the United States. He once 
said in my hearing that Americans were too much en- 
grossed with the love of money to have a real love of 
art, but they were more impressionable than the English, 
who were the most unmusical people on earth. I have 
heard more than one eminent musician say the same 
thing. In one of his letters about this time he says : ' I 
put myself for a certain time at the entire disposition 
of the impresario, and may God preserve you from ever 
falling into such slavery. It is all over with art ; only 
the shop remains. You become an automatical instru- 
ment, and the dignity of the artist is lost.' Long after 
this tour he wrote to a friend : ' The whole time I was 
displeased with myself to such a degree that when a 
few years later another tour was proposed to me with 
the offer of fees amounting to half a million, I flatly 
refused.' " 

Jolly times in Bohemia mingle with the more 
serious and more professional remembrances of 
the journalist-critic. A night of mirth and 
merry-making is thus recalled : 

" My pleasantest memory of Christine Nilsson is con- 
nected with her birthday celebration at the Sherman 
House in Chicago in 1871, to which I have already 
made allusion. She was in the gayest of moods that 
evening, waived all the conventionalities, and showed 
herself a Bohemian of the most rollicking, sunshiny 
kind. Verger sang musical caricatures of the leading 
barytones on the stage. Vieuxtemps sacrificed his high- 
art ideas to the humor of ' The Arkansas Traveller ' 
and the fascinations of ' Money Musk ' ; Brignoli played 
his Battle March, which he thought was an inspiration, 
and was inclined to be offended when he looked round 
and saw the company, with Nilsson in the lead, doing 
an extraordinary cake-walk to its rhythm, for Brignoli 
took that march very seriously. Nilsson gave some 
ludicrous imitations of the trombone, double-bass, tym- 
pani, and bassoon, and sang humorous songs. The 
closing act of the revelry, which lasted far into the 
small hours, was a travesty on the Garden Scene in 
' Faust ' by Nilsson and Brignoli, in which the big tenor's 
gravity of mein and awkwardness of love-making was 



admirably set off by Nilsson's volatile foolery. It was 
a night of hilarity and fun-making long to be remem- 
bered. And now I read that the once famous singer 
spent her sixty-fourth birthday in the Swedish village 
of Gardsby and delighted an enthusiastic audience with 
the song, ' I think I am just fourteen.' I should not 
be surprised if she honestly believes it, for she is one of 
the elect who can never grow old in spirit." 

Theodore Thomas is of course a congenial 
theme to his old friend and authorized biog- 
rapher, even though that biographer can have 
little that is fresh and important to add to his 
earlier extended account of the great conductor. 
A puzzling bit of chronology arrests atten- 
tion for a moment. After writing that " Mr. 
Thomas had three failures in his life which were 
bitter disappointments and for which he was in 
no way responsible," Mr. Upton says that " one 
of these failures was the Columbian Exposition 
scheme in 1893," which is described ; and that 
" Mr. Thomas's second failure was his adminis- 
tration of the Cincinnati College of Music in 
1880 "; and, finally, that " Mr. Thomas's third 
failure was the American Opera Company, 
organized in 1886 for the representation of 
opera in English by American artists" — an 
organization that went to pieces after two years 
of strenuous effort. However, there is scrip- 
tural precedent for causing the last to be first. 

Five of Mr. Upton's twenty-two chapters 
treat more particularly of the history of musi- 
cal societies in Chicago, going back to the year 
1833, when " the little village of six hundred 
residents, squatted among the sloughs near the 
mouth of the river, heard its first music in the 
strains of Mark Beaubien's fiddle." The author's 
charter membership in and presidency of the 
Apollo Club qualify him to write understand- 
ingly of Chicago's musical organizations. The 
subjoined paragraph, touching on a matter of 
recent musical and art history, is interesting for 
various reasons. 

" The Studebaker Theatre is the home of English 
opera in Chicago, though the so-called grand operas have 
frequently been presented upon its stage. It is but one 
feature of the Fine Arts Building, and the Fine Arts 
Building is the accomplishment of Mr. Charles C. Cur- 
tiss. It is a hive of busy workers in music, painting, 
sculpture, literature, and the arts and crafts. Its various 
cells house the theatre, the Music Hall, the Assembly 
Hall, the Amateiu" Musical Club, the Woman's Club, 
the Fortnightly Club, the Caxton Club, ' The Dial,' . . . 
and many other associations of an artistic character, and 
the studios of a small army of busy workers in beautiful 
things. . . . From roof to basement it is filled with what 
is somewhat tritely called ' the good, the true, and the 
beautiful,' and no sordid or unclean things are allowed 
entrance. Though not a musician himself, Mr. Curtiss 
is one of the charter members of the Apollo Club, and 
was its first secretary. His whole life has been spent

in the advancement of art in Chicago, and he has had 
the satisfaction of living to witness the rich fruition of 
his lofty ideals and to enjoy the rewards of his honor- 
able struggle in the attachment of a host of friends and 
the success of his undertaking." 

The professional criticisms and judgments 
that sprinkle the pages of this veteran student 
and friend of music and musicians add to the 
value of his book. Few of his readers will have 
any memories of their own concerning a great 
number of the musical artists introduced, and 
we are thankful for the crisp and clean-cut char- 
acterizations of these departed celebrities. The 
style in which Mr. Upton tells his interesting 
story makes it highly readable from beginning 
to end. It is most fortunate that he yielded to 
the solicitations of friends, and decided to pre- 
serve, " in compact and accessible shape," these 
rich memories of his prime. More than fifty 
portraits, and views of the Sauganash Tavern 
and the old Crosby Opera House, are included 
in the volume. Percy F. Bicknell. 



••XEARNESS TO ]S"ATURE" IK ENGLISH 

liANDscAPE Painting.* 

Mr. Fletcher's book on Eichard Wilson — 
sometimes called " the father of English land- 
scape painting " — will be welcome to many: it 
is quite time something of the sort should have 
appeared. Hitherto this interesting artist has 
been little more than a name, or an appellation 
joined to the remembrance of a few pictures and 
a few anecdotes. And it has not been easy to 
find anything more, — anything to be depended 
upon, one must add. 

The traditional view of Wilson is that he 
was but one of the school of classical landscape 
dominant in his day. Thus, in so widely read 
a book as Muther's "Modem Painting" it is 
said that "Wilson had the fixed idea that the 
Creator had only made Nature to serve as a 
framework for the Grief of Niobe and as a 
vehicle for classical architecture." But such a 
view is so opposed to what little is common 
knowledge of Wilson that no one could form a 
real idea of the man from it. It is a probable 
tradition that the figures in Wilson's pictures 
were sometimes painted by others. If this be 
the case, can we imagine a man painting only 
what he thought the framework, and leaving the 
real thing to another ? Again, it is one of the 
stock quotations from Sir Joshua that Wilson's 
pictures were too near common Nature to admit

supernatural objects. We can hardly imagine 
that a man who had all of Claude to imitate 
should have spoilt his mythological pictures by 
having the framework too much like Nature. 
Such remarks, if not absurd (and of course 
many wiU not think they are), are at least 
clearly conventional and not based upon the 
known facts. 

So in his later study of English landscape, 
Muther presents a different view : he sees some- 
thing more in Wilson. Of the Niobe he now 
writes : " Here sighs and groans Nature her- 
self . . . this is a picture which points, not 
backward to Claude, but forward to Turner." 
So also Mr. C. J. Holmes, writing in the " Bur- 
lington Magazine " a little while ago, says of 
Wilson's "View on the Wye" that it might 
almost stand for " a prelude to the revolt in 
favor of Nature which was completed by Con- 
stable "; and the same idea is suggested by 
other of Wilson's later landscapes. With two 
such different views — the traditional and the 
artistic — it is certainly worth while for some- 
one to look carefully into the subject. 

The merit of Mr. Fletcher's work will best 
come out if we consider his main contention ; for 
even though we may not agree with his final 
result, we shall learn something from his pre- 
sentation. Mr. Fletcher, so far from thinking 
of Wilson as " the English Claude," as the last 
petering-out of the classic landscape of Claude 
and the Poussins, regards him as a virile origin- 
ator, as a forerunner, as one who before his time 
perceived beauties in Nature which others com- 
ing after him were more fortunate in exhibiting ; 
in a few words, as the father of English land- 
scape. I cannot agree with him in this respect ; 
and although he has many sources of opinion 
not open to an amateur like myself, I believe it 
will be not impertinent to review the case. 

The revival of an interest in Nature was one 
of the marks of the eighteenth century in 
England, as elsewhere. It is to be seen in 
literature and in painting, in landscape gar- 
dening and in travel, — indeed, in all possible 
forms of life. In England this interest in 
Nature usually appeared in one of three forms. 
First, there was the charm of the beautiful par 
excellence^ as it seemed, the large, free, well- 
proportioned, and elegant, well enough repre- 
sented in landscape art by the pictures of Claude 
Lorraine. Then there was the charm of the 
romantic, of the wild, rough, fierce aspects of 
Nature that may be seen in the landscapes of 
Salvator Rosa. And, lastly, there was the pleas- 
ant, comfortable, pastoral kind of charm, very 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



209 



dear to the English heart, of which something 
is to be seen in Ruysdael and Hobbema. These 
different kinds of beauty will be found in all 
sorts of different forms ; perhaps the last is the 
most thoroughly English, and has remained the 
chief element in natural scenery that has ap- 
pealed to the English mind. However that be, 
there is little doubt that it represented the main 
feeling for Nature in England during the eight- 
eenth century, — " the beauty of the grove and 
the shade," not classic nor romantic, but still 
charming and beautiful. 

As these three views of Nature came to expres- 
sion in the English painting of the eighteenth 
century, it is the classic landscape (if we may so 
call it) which is to be seen in Wilson. Whether 
he was or was not something more than the lover 
of classic landscape, as Mr. Fletcher thinks, he 
was certainly that. The second kind, the roman- 
tic landscape of Salvator Rosa, is represented, 
in the eighteenth century at least, by no one. 
Wilson has something of the quality, and the 
earlier pictures of Gainsborough have something 
of it ; but of neither was it the prevailing spirit. 
A few poets and novelists loved the wild and 
horrid crag, the solemn and awful mountain ; 
but the painters cared less for them. For the 
third — the pastoral beauty, the beauty of the 
grove and the shade, — of course the man is 
Gainsborough. 

Now the prevailing spirit not only of the 
greatest landscape of the nineteenth century, 
but particularly of English landscape, has been, 
not the classic, and not the romantic either, but 
the charming, the familiar, the pastoral beauty. 
Take a few representatives : Constable and 
Cotman, Rousseau and Monet, the Worpswede 
group in Germany, for instance, and George 
Inness in our own country, — these represent 
not such landscape as Claude or Salvator, but 
something more like Gainsborough. If you ask 
a landscape painter why he does not go into the 
mountains to paint, he will be likely to tell you 
that mountain crags are not paintable. If you 
ask him why he does not paint classic landscapes 
like Turner's, he will tell you, possibly, that 
Nature has not yet quite caught up to Turner. 
But the beauty and the truth oi pay sage intime 
is felt by everyone, and is certainly the dominant 
spirit of English landscape, from Crome, Cot- 
man, and Constable, down. And of such paint- 
ing, of such feeling for Nature, Gainsborough 
is without question the first great figure. It 
may be a superficial view, perhaps, but certainly 
a glance at " Cornard Wood " or " The Water- 
ing Place " will make one feel that Gainsborough 



is distinctly modem. On the other hand, no 
picture of Wilson's that I have seen will give 
one any such idea : Wilson, like Claude, has a 
very great and definite charm, but his feeling 
for landscape — so far as concerns the spirit of 
it — is not modern at all. 

Such, I presume, would be the contention of 
those who see in Gainsborough rather than 
Wilson the father of English landscape ; and 
such a contention is doubtless entirely familiar 
to Mr. Fletcher, for he bases his own opinion 
on very different views. Mr. Holmes, in the 
passage quoted, says that some of Wilson's later 
pictures make one think of Constable. So they 
do ; not only the one which Mr. Holmes men- 
tions particularly, but several others reproduced 
in Mr. Fletcher's book. Indeed, many Ameri- 
can readers, at least, in looking at the reproduc- 
tions of Wilson's English landscapes will feel 
that they have not really known the man so far, 
that he had sides they were not aware of. The 
quality will strike any observer ; still, it seems 
but slight when we turn to Gainsborough. 

Mr. Fletcher presents a different view. He 
presents Wilson's classicism in a very interesting 
way, and also the native quality of which we 
have just spoken. But when he calls Wilson 
the father of English landscape, he has some- 
thing else in mind. He does not press the 
matter of dates, wherein Wilson has the advan- 
tage, nor does he admit the importance of the 
spirit and sentiment, where he has not ; he takes 
another position. " To see and feel was the great 
thing, and that was what Wilson was the first 
'landscapist to do." " Even if it were true that 
he saw only Italy, he would still rightly be 
regarded as the artist with whom in Britain 
sincere landscape art may be said to have had 
its beginning." Closeness to Nature — that was 
the thing in Wilson, thinks Mr. Fletcher 
(pp. 167, 168) ; in Wilson to a degree in which 
it was not in Gainsborough. 

That is a point where I, at least, shall not 
venture to dispute with Mr. Fleteher. Whether 
Wilson or Gainsborough were really closer to 
Nature, is a matter that I must leave to those 
who know their pictures more thoroughly, as 
well as the especial forms of Nature that they 
painted. Wilson, according to Mr. Fletcher, 
usually painted in his studio, and was even con- 
tent with a Stilton cheese and a pot of porter as 
a suggestion for one of his finest pictures. Now 
Gainsborough, in his early years at Ipswich, 
said that he had painted every tree and every 
stile within ten miles around ; if, then, Wilson's 
pictures are closer to Nature than Gainsborough's, 



210 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



it will be admitted that he was a man of remark- 
able powers. " His plains and mountains, and 
the very forms of his trees and tints of his ver- 
dure, are, far more than in Gainsborough, of 
the actual shape and substance of the same 
things in Nature." It may be so ; it is a matter 
of fact and not of inference, and in this country 
at least one cannot really be a master of the 
materials for judgment. But on the basis of 
the material that does exist, such a view appears 
very eccentric. 

Such as it is, however, Mr. Fletcher practi- 
cally devotes his book to it ; and whether one 
agree or not, the book is interesting. He shows 
us Wilson as a lover of classic landscape cer- 
tainly, but as distinctly a sincere, original painter, 
firmly intent on rendering Nature as he saw it. 
Unappreciated he was, of course ; but that very 
fact shows that he was not the follower of a 
fashionable tradition, but a man who was bound 
to see and paint for himself. That sort of criti- 
cism, and the twenty reproductions of Wilson's 
pictures, are the chief things of interest in Mr. 
Fletcher's book. The biographical part is slight, 
because there is very little material for it. But 
Mr. Fletcher has used what he could get, and 
has so thought over and appreciated Wilson's 
painting that his book does much to give us some- 
thing of an idea of one who, whatever else he was 
or was not, was an artist of power and charm.

The Political Goal of Canada.* 



In an address before the Canadian Club of 
Toronto, which forms the first of the series 
of addresses and essays in the volume entitled 
" The Kingdom of Canada," Mr. John S. Ewart 
draws attention to the significance of the wide- 
spread movement for the creation of Canadian 
Clubs in all the cities and towns of the Dominion. 
He says : 

" Canada has commenced to realize herself, to believe 
in herself, and to recognize that for her, too, there is 
a principal part to play upon the stage of the world. 
Canada has become conscious of the feelings and aspi- 
rations and the strong strivings of strenuous manhood, 
and, on the other hand, of the utter impossibility of full 
expression and assertion in mere colonial status. Divine 
discontent (the necessary pre-condition of all improve- 
ment), in regard to her political semi-servitude, has 
taken strong hold upon Canada, and she is taking stock, 
and extending the figures, and considering where she 
now is, and what her future is to be." 

" Political semi-servitude " seems rather an

Colonial Conferences, The Alaska Boundary, and other Essays.

extreme expression to use in defining the present 
status of a country possessing the measure of 
self-government enjoyed by Canada. Neverthe- 
less there can be no doubt in the mind of any 
thoughtful observer as to the widespread discon- 
tent on the part of Canadians with their status 
as a part of the British Empire. Canada is ap- 
proaching, perhaps slowly but certainly surely, 
the parting of the ways. Self-respect will not 
permit her to remain satisfied with a union which 
savors of paternalism, however nominal the ob- 
noxious link may be, and however tactfully it 
may be hidden. 

But while there exists practical unanimity 
among thoughtful Canadians as to the impossi- 
bility of maintaining the status quo, there is a 
wide divergence of opinion as to the goal toward 
which Canada should set her face. Mr. Ewart 
himself, in the last of these essays, " The Future 
of Canada," suggests five possible alternatives : 
1, Union with the United States ; 2, an inde- 
pendent republic ; 3, Union with the United 
Kingdom ; 4, an independent monarchy with a 
Canadian king ; and, 5, an independent mon- 
archy with the same sovereign as the United 
Kingdom. After arguing the probability or 
otherwise of Canadians accepting each of these 
alternatives, he rejects all but the fifth. Here 
is his own summary of the argument : 

" The road of our political development has not led 
us away from monarchy, nor from the British Sovereign; 
it has led us to almost complete independence [which, 
by the way, is hardly the same thing as " political semi- 
servitude "3 ; the termination of the road is not far off, 
and it is the Kingdom of Canada imder the British Sov- 
ereign; probably we shall not turn from that road to 
jom the United States ; nor shall we become a republic 
by ourselves ; Imperial Federation either in the lump or 
by instalments is impracticable and impossible." 

Mr. Ewart argues his case with the skill and 
persuasiveness that one expects from one of the 
ablest members of the Canadian bar, but it is 
just in his point of view that one feels the weak- 
ness lies. His essays are not so much an impar- 
tial examination of the arguments for and against 
these several alternatives, and the probable atti- 
tude of Canadians toward them, as they are an 
argument in favor of one and against all the 
others. He holds, in fact, a brief for the King- 
dom of Canada, as against the other alternatives, 
and particularly as against Imperial Federation. 
It is open to question if the movement toward 
Imperial Federation is anything like as dead in 
Canada, and in other parts of the British Empire, 
as Mr. Ewart supposes. It might, in fact, be 
nearer the truth to say that ambitious young 
Canada — young Canada that forms the back- 
bone of the movement that is finding expression 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



211 



just now in the formation of scores of Canadian 
Clubs — is divided into at least two camps. One 
of these, for which Mr. Ewart may be accepted 
as spokesman, looks toward a British Empire 
composed of several nations owning allegiance 
to one and the same sovereign, but otherwise 
absolutely independent. The other, represented 
by Dr. Parkin and Professor Leacock, seeks to 
bring about a federation of the Empire, which, 
while safeguarding the liberties and interests of 
each, will make it part and parcel of one vital 
and powerful whole. The former, in fact, stands 
for decentralization ; the latter for centraliza- 
tion. Apart from these two great schools of 
thought in Canada, there is a less clearly de- 
fined sentiment which might in time take form 
in a movement for the creation of an independ- 
ent Canadian republic. Finally, there is the 
party whose platform is annexation to the 
United States — Dr. Goldwin Smith. 

While there may, therefore, be diiferences of 
opinion as to the correctness of all Mr. Ewart's 
conclusions, his essays may be taken as repre- 
sentative of the views of at least one strong and 
growing school of thought in Canada ; and to 
that extent they are of distinct interest and value.

The "liiTTLE Giant " of Illinois.* 



It was in the Valley of the Mississippi River 
that the sentiment of the nationality of our 
country was most consistently nurtured and 
longest maintained. From here, where North- 
erners and Southerners settled side by side along 
the banks of the great river on whose waters 
floated their commerce, the two most prominent 
leaders who stood for the perpetuity of the 
national union were chosen at a critical moment 
by the two great political parties ; and it is not 
strange that both of these leaders came from the 
state wherein the Northern and Southern ele- 
ments had been amalgamated most completely 
— Illinois. 

Because Lincoln at the end of his career was 
connected with events belonging to post-bellum 
days — a newer and more modern period — it 
is yet too early to expect a dispassionate and 
scientifically conceived biography of him ; at 
least, none such has yet appeared. On the 
other hand, Douglas's main career ended with 
the period of agitation about slavery, and the 
events in which he was most concerned are now

Allen Johnson. New York: The Macmillan Co. 



so far removed from the present that a true 
picture of him and his activities may be success- 
fully attempted. This attempt Professor Johnson 
has made in his biography of Douglas ; and it 
must be conceded that for the most part he has 
admirably succeeded. 

Stephen A. Douglas was a politician of the 
type that flourished before the Civil War, and 
it is as such that the author has pictured him ; 
and this justifies the sub-title, " A Study in 
American Politics." Yet the very limitation 
of the subject has led to omissions that prevent 
the study from being a complete picture of 
Douglas. Professor Johnson has not chosen to 
enter into his career as lawyer and judge except 
in the most casual manner, since these activities 
were so subordinated to Douglas's political ca- 
reer ; and for the same reason we find little dis- 
cussion of his business enterprises — such as his 
land speculations, etc. It will be necessary to 
work out more carefully such phases of Douglas's 
activities before the man will be presented to us 
in a final portrait. 

The description of the politician, however, is 
very satisfactory. The author has traced his 
career carefully through all available material, 
and for his painstaking study he is deserving of 
the highest praise. Private letters, the Douglas 
autobiography, and the various public docu- 
ments, have been used with care and discrim- 
ination. Particularly to be commended is the 
treatment of Douglas's promotion of Western 
State building enterprises through the Commit- 
tee on Territories both in the Senate and the 
House of Representatives. Douglas was so 
closely identified with the slavery agitation that 
for this phase of his exertions he has not always 
received the credit that is due him. 

At an important epoch in the development 
of the West, in the year 1845, Douglas was 
appointed Chairman of the House Committee 
on Territories. His work in this capacity is 
thus summarized by Professor Johnson : 

" The vision which dazzled his imaginatioa was that 
of an ocean-bound republic; to that manifest destiny 
he had dedicated his talents, not by any self-conscious 
surrender, but by the irresistible sweep of his imagina^ 
tion, always impressed by things in the large and rein- 
forced by contact with actual western conditions. 
Finance, the tariff, and similar public questions of a 
technical natui'e, he was content to leave to others; but 
those which directly concerned the making of a conti- 
nental republic he mastered with almost jealous eager- 
ness. He had now attained a position which for fourteen 
years was conceded to be indisputably his ; for no sooner 
had he entered the Senate than he was made chairman 
of a similar committee. His career must be measured 
by the wisdom of his statesmanship in the peculiar 
problems which he was called upon to solve concerning 



212 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



the public domain. In this sphere he laid claim to 
expert judgment; from him, therefore, much was re- 
quired; but it was the fate of nearly every territorial 
question to be bound up more or less intimately with 
the slavery question." 

In this estimate the author is correct. To 
Douglas, the occupation of the public domain 
by settlers and the acquisition of new territory 
for the same purpose appeared the paramount 
issues of his time. The list of States and Terri- 
tories for which he was sponsor is a long one, 
and the importance of his work may be shown 
by the fact that the list includes Oregon, Texas, 
California, New Mexico, Kansas, Nebraska. 

Douglas's attitude toward the slavery agita- 
tion is first to be explained by his interest in 
this Western expansion, and his political ambi- 
tion is a contributory cause. In every discussion 
concerning the formation of Territories or the 
admission of States, the slavery question was 
introduced. The South saw itself being out- 
stripped in the race of expansion, and demanded 
more than equal privileges, which the fanatic 
zeal of the abolitionists would take away entirely. 
This antagonism of purposes and policies forced 
the issue on the chairman of the Committee on 
Territories ; and his solution was that panacea 
with which his name is so closely associated — 
" Squatter Sovereignty." Such a solution must 
have appeared absurd to the men of the older 
communities of the East, but to the Westerners 
it seemed logical. As Professor Johnson writes : 

" The taproot from which squatter sovereignty grew 
and flourished was the instmctive attachment of the 
Western American to local government; or, to put the 
matter conversely, his dislike of external authority. . . . 
Under stress of real or fancied wrongs, it was natural 
for settlers in these frontier regions to meet for joint 
protest, or, if the occasion were grave enough, to enter 
into political association, to resist encroachment upon 
what they felt to be their natural rights. Whenever 
thej felt called upon to justify their course, they did so 
in language that repeated, consciously or unconsciously, 
the theory of the social contract with which the political 
thought of the age was surcharged. In these frontier 
communities was born the political habit that manifested 
itself on successive frontiers of American advance 
across the continent, and that finally in the course of 
the slavery controversy found apt expression in the 
doctrine of squatter sovereignty " (p. 161). 

In tracing out the development of this idea 
in national politics, and Douglas's defense of 
it. Professor Johnson is particularly happy. 
There have been excellent treatments of the 
subject before ; but the personal element that is 
naturally so conspicuous in this narrative gives 
an added vividness to the discussion. Conspic- 
uous for its clearness and impartiality is the 
account of the Lincoln-Doiiglas Debate, wherein 



full justice is done to the better qualities of 
Douglas's speeches. 

The " Little Giant " was, however, first of all 
a politician ; and Professor Johnson fails to 
make a hero of him, nor does he try. His 
attempt is that of the true historian, the draw- 
ing of a faithful portrait ; and he does not seek 
to gloss over the weakness of his subject. In 
writing of the public indignation at the passing 
of the Kansas-Nebraska biU, he passes the fol- 
lowing just judgment : 

" Douglas was so constituted temperamentally that he 
both could not, and would not, confront the situation 
fairly and squarely. This want of sensitiveness to the 
force of ethical conviction stirring the masses is the 
most conspicuous and regrettable aspect of his state- 
craft. Personally, Douglas had a high sense of honor 
and duty ; in private affairs he was scrupulously honest ; 
and if at times he was shifty in politics, he played the 
game with quite as much fairness as those contemporary 
politicians who boasted of the integrity of their motives. 
He preferred to be frank; he meant to deal justly by 
all men. Even so, he failed to understand the impell- 
ing power of those moral ideals which border on the 
unattainable. . . . His was the philosophy of the attain- 
able. Results that were approximately just and fair 
satisfied him" (p. 270). 

Douglas's failure to grasp the significance of 
the moral issue then dominating the North was 
the cause of his failure to maintain his leader- 
ship. Western expansion, whose long and force- 
ful advocacy was one of the most conspicuous 
events of his career, had become of secondary 
importance on account of the controversy over 
slavery to which that very expansion had given 
birth. So bitter had grown the feeling over 
slavery, that the nation itself was endangered ; 
and in the coming strife Douglas was obliged 
finally to make a choice. His feeling for nation- 
alism, learned by him on the Illinois prairies, 
pointed out his course. He clung to the Union ; 
but in this new issue, which he had so long- 
attempted to suppress, there was no place for 
his leadership. An almost unknown man had 
usurped his position in the West. The picture 
of Douglas holding Lincoln's hat at the inau- 
guration of his rival is symbolic of the new era 
in the life' of the Republic.

Recext Fiction.* 



The story to which Mr. Robert Herrick has given 
the simple but significant title " Together " is the 
strongest book that he has thus far written, and estab- 
lishes his title to a place in the front rank of our 
contemporary American novelists. It is a study of 
married life as it appears to a keen observer of our 
society, whose method is that of the realist, and 
whose sincerity is beyond question. The result of 
his observations is not pleasing, and he is certain to 
be dubbed "cynic" and "pessimist" by the outraged 
hosts of hypocrisy. We do not think that he deserves 
either ascription, although there is some touch of bit- 
terness in his treatment of the conjugal relation, and 
although the absence of any trace of humor makes 
gloomy reading of his book. But Mr. Herrick is at 
heart an idealist of the passionate Ibsen type, and 
his surgery is founded upon the belief that the most 
debased society has within it a principle of self- 
regeneration. He has clearly voiced his own views 
through the lips of one of his minor characters, who 
thus comments upon our diseased modern life : 

" Egotism is the pestilence of our day, — the sort of base 
intellectual egotism that seeks to taste for the sake of tasting. 
Egotism is rampant. And worst of all it has corrupted the 
women, in whom should be Nature's great conservative 
element. So our body social is rotten with intellectual 
egotism. Yes, I mean just what you have prided yourself 
on, — Culture, Education, Individuality, Cleverness, — ' lead- 
ing your own lives,' Refinement, Experience, Development, 
call it what you will. — it is the same, the inturning of the 
Spirit to cherish self. ... So what have you made of mar- 
riage, ' leading your own lives ' ? You make marriage a sort 
of intelligent and intellectual prostitution — and you develop 
divorce. The best among you — those who will not marry 
unless the man can arouse their ' best selves ' — will not bear 
children even then. And you think you have the right to 
choose again when your so-called souls have played you false 
the first time. . . . And now you know what I meant when 
I said that a neurasthenic world needed a new religion ! . . . 
Not the old religion of abnegation, the impossible myths that 
come to us out of the pessimistic East, created for a relief, 
a soporific, a means of evasion, — I do not mean that as re- 
ligion. But another faith, which abides in each one of us, 
if we look for it. We rise with it in the morning. It is a 
faith in life apart from our own personal fate. Because we 
live on the surface, we despair, we get sick. Look below 
into the sustaining depths beyond desire, beyond self, to the 
depths, — and you will find it. . . . And as for beauty and 
satisfaction and significance, — it is infinite in every moment 
of every life — when the eyes are once open to see." 

It is not a philosophy of despair which is thus epito- 
mized ; still less is it a gospel of cynicism. But 
the author is vehement in his denunciation of the 
present-day conditions of American society, as re- 
vealed in the home, the mart, and the pleasance alike. 
He finds the root of most of the evils which he por-

trays in false ideals of married life, and these he 
embodies in a number of concrete examples, sub- 
jected to the most merciless analysis. One case, 
indeed, he gives us of a union which is fundamen- 
tally sane and happy, but it occupies only an incon- 
spicuous place upon his broad canvas. With this 
exception, married life, as Mr. Herrick portrays it, 
appears as a failure, and his characters suffer ship- 
wreck as the consequence of their inconsiderate mat- 
ing, or of their absorption in sordid and vulgar 
ambitions. To what extent is his picture typical of 
the essential truth of our civilization — this is the 
insistent question which his discussion puts before 
us. We think the view taken is too dark to be alto- 
gether just, although such examples as he provides 
are doubtless to be found in gi-eat numbers in our 
modern life. But the logical corrective of his posi- 
tion is supplied by one of his own paragraphs. 
" Perfect justice, a complete picture of society in a 
civilization of eighty millions, requires many shades. 
The darker shades are true only of the rotting refuse, 
the scum of the whole. Among the married millions 
most are, fortunately, still struggling through the 
earlier types from the pioneer to the economist. But 
as the water runs there lies the sea beyond." It is, 
then, as a tendency rather than as a finality that this 
depiction of married life must be considered, and the 
social documents of the time certainly give us much 
corroborative evidence of the tendency toward which 
the novelist directs our attention. But it is not logi- 
cal to conclude that the future of America is with the 
alien races that pour themselves through Castle Gar- 
den. We still have as healthy a native stock as any 
that comes to us from abroad, and there is no reason 
to despair of a regeneration that shall spring from 
within our own organism. On the whole, Mr. Her- 
rick's indictment of our materialistic and pleasure- 
seeking society donne furieusement h penser^ and is 
not to be quashed by the shallow platitudes of optim- 
ism. Such a study as his, holding the mirror up to 
the unlovely phases of our existence, and reflecting 
a searching light into the darker recesses of our 
national character, must make for good, since its 
truthfulness is undeniable, although it does not give 
us all the truth. The book has obvious faults. It 
lacks the virtue of reticence where that virtue is most 
needed, it is over-vehement in its exhortation, and 
its didactic zeal makes it miss the broad humanity of 
the highest fictive art. It is over-particular, and its 
very realism makes many of the characters (especially 
the men) unreal. But it is a strong and earnest book, ' 
wrought with conscientious skill, and its best passages 
achieve a marked degree of moral impressiveness, at 
times rise to an almost lyrical height of beauty. 

It is something of a relief to turn from "To- 
gether," with all its merits, to a book like Mr. F. 
Hopkinson Smith's " Peter," which affords reading 
of a less disquieting sort. Mr. Smith is a senti- 
mental optimist by temperament, although he by no 
means ignores the sterner and ignobler aspects of 
life, and he chiefly delights in the depiction of lov- 
able characters. All the principal characters in

*' Peter " are lovable — the bank teller whose name 
is the name of the book (although he is not its hero), 
his sister Felicia, the "• gentleman journeyman 
tailor," Isaac Cohen, who lives under the same roof, 
the sweet heroine, and the candid youth who loves 
and wins her. By way of contrast, there is only 
the hero's uncle, who fleeces lambs in Wall Street, 
and is righteously made to cut his own fingers in the 
process. The hero, when he discovers the sources 
of his uncle's wealth, is unwilling to accept from 
him either home or employment any longer, and 
bravely sets out to make his own way in the world — 
a course which the end justifies, both practically and 
sentimentally. Once more the author finds in a 
novel the medium for setting forth the old-fashioned, 
simple, and gracious ideal of life which he has 
brought before our eyes many times before, an ideal 
in which manhood counts for more than money 
and breeding for more than worldly success. He 
affects — like so many other novelists from Thack- 
eray down — the confidential attitude toward his 
readers, and easily persuades them to his ways of 
thinking. This new story of his has both charm 
and fragrance ; if it does not reach very far into the 
depths of life, it at least shows us the surface in most 
alluring colors. 

Since Mr. Chambers has taken to writing novels 
about the lives of the idle rich, he has lost much of 
the charm which compelled us in his earlier books. 
There is little human interest in his new theme, and 
neither artificial sentiment nor smart dialogue is an 
acceptable substitute. It is true that his genuine 
feeling for nature — the feeling of both naturalist 
and artist — contrives to find some expression in 
these later inventions, and that saves them from 
absolute aridity. It is also true that he usually 
takes the precaution to give us a heroine who is 
superior to her moneyed environment, and a hero 
who is not handicapped by millions, and these are 
saving graces. But such books as "The Younger 
Set," "The Fighting Chance," and "The Firing 
Line," are weak productions when considered as 
successors of " Cardigan " and " Lorraine." " The 
Firing Line " might as well have been called by any 
other name. It is the story of a young landscape 
gardener called to plan a park in Florida for a 
wealthy winter resident. The heroine is an adopted 
daughter of his employer, and the rest of the char- 
acters are irresponsible or mischief-making idlers. 
Some two years before the story opens, the heroine, 
learning of her nameless origin, and ashamed thereof, 
had rushed into a meaningless marriage, which 
naturally proves an impediment when the rightful 
lover appears. By this device the agony is drawn 
out for some hundreds of pages. Then the husband 
(who is one in name only) considerately commits 
suicide, and the story is brought to the inevitable 
end. The best thing about this rather cheap book 
is its semi-tropical setting, which is the author's 
opportunity for a great deal of observant and loving 
description. The worst part of it is the slangy talk 
of most of the characters. 



What the Governor of North Carolina said to the 
Governor of South Carolina upon a certain occasion 
has become a part of our national legend. What 
actually happened (if we may believe so veracious 
a historian as Mr. Meredith Nicholson) was that 
they trumped up a public quarrel as a sop to jour- 
nalism, and then quietly repaired to a secluded cabin 
in the woods, put on old clothes, supplied themselves 
with the necessary provisions, and went into a week's 
session over the Great American Game (the one that 
is played with chips). Among the cares of state 
which they thus temporarily escaped was the vexing 
problem of a notorious moonshiner, who asserted 
his inalienable rights in the border region of the two 
states, and was at the same time so useful as a vote- 
getter that each governor wished the other to deal 
with him. Now each of these governors had a daugh- 
ter, and each daughter an ardent pursuer in the 
shape of a lover at first sight (who, as we all know, 
is the most eager of all lovers in the romantic chase). 
And these two girls, with the connivance of their 
respective swains, and not knowing what had be- 
come of their respective fathers, proceeded to get 
busy, taking the reins of government into their 
hands, and stirring up a very pretty border warfare 
between the two states, all with the object of cap- 
turing the aforementioned champion of the sacred 
right of making one's own unlicensed whiskey. 
There results a comic opera situation that is ex- 
tremely amusing, and one exciting incident follows 
upon another until the helm of state gets back into the 
rightful hands. All this is told, in finely humorous 
vein, and with artistic deftness of touch, in " The 
Little Brown Jug at Kildare," which we recommend 
as a sovereign specific for loathed melancholy or any 
other form of the blues. 

The American colonies have provided material 
for historical romances without number, and it is 
somewhat venturesome to add another to the list. 
The inventive faculty of Mr. Henry Longan Stuart 
seems sufficient, however, to warrant him in making 
the venture, and his " Weeping Cross " is a story 
with qualities sufficiently distinctive to justify its 
existence. The narrative is in the memoir form. Its 
hero, an Irishman in training for the Jesuit priest- 
hood, fights for the King in the civil wars, is captured 
at Worcester, and sent by Cromwell as a bondman 
to New England. He becomes the servant of a farmer 
at Longmeadow, and his master's only daughter, a 
woman of passionate temper and tragic history, be- 
comes the controlling influence upon his life. His 
stormy wooing and other highly emotional matters 
occupy the story until near the close, when the couple 
flee into the forest, and are wedded by a friendly 
priest. Then the romance culminates with the his- 
torical massacre of Longmeadow, and in its sequel 
the woman is slain. It makes a vivid and robust 
tale, but its effectiveness is dulled by interminable 
passages of description and introspective analysis. 
Its extensive and rather dull moralizing makes it 
indeed, in considerable part, the " unworldly tale " 
promised by the title-page, but does not add to its

attractiveness. There is a distinct novelty, of course, 
in giving a Catholic hero to a story of puritan New 
England, but tradition has reported that two or three 
priests were concerned in the Longmeadow horror, 
and that a Catholic was known to he living in the 
town ass an indentured servant. This is the slender 
historical basis of Mr. Stuart's invention. His title 
comes from Montaigne, who tells us that men who 
wed are likely to repent their bargain and come 
home by " weeping crosse." 

Mr. John Germain, a gentleman of fifty and the 
owner of extensive lands, was paying his annual 
visit to his clergyman brother, when 
" An adventure of a sentimental kind presented itself to him, 
engaged him, carried him into mid-air upon a winged horse, 
and set him treading clouds and such-like filmy footing. . . . 
Blimtly, he, a widower of ten years' standing, fell in love 
with a young person half his age, and of no estate at all — 
but quite the contrary ; and, after an interval of time which 
he chose to ignore, applied himself earnestly to the practice 
of poetry. There ensued certain curious relationships be- 
tween quite ordinary people which justify me in calling my 
book a Comedy of Degrees." 

Thus Mr. Maurice Hewlett, by way of introduction 
to his first novel of everyday folk and our prosaic 
modern life. No more primitive lovers for him, 
ranging in the enchanted forest, no more kings and 
queens of historical fame, no more eighteenth- 
century sentimental journeys or idyllic adventures 
on the road in Italy, but a story about people who 
wear ordinary clothes and whose speech is that to 
which our modern ears are daily accustomed. It is 
no small tribute to the author to say that his mas- 
tery of this prosaic material is as complete as was his 
mastery of the legendary and historical manners in 
which he worked before, that he has fitted his style to 
his theme with absolute nicety of adjustment. This 
modern reading of the tale of King Cophetua and 
the beggar maid is a perfectly charming product of 
inventive fancy, instinct with the essential spirit of 
comedy — by which we mean that there is no touch 
of the farcical about it, that it is rich in human 
feeling, and that the smile it brings to our lips is 
likely to find us close to the verge of tears. The pre- 
cipitation of tragedy which might so easily result 
from this mingling of the human elements of love 
and duty and instinctive feeling may cloud the 
medium for brief moments, but quickly disappears 
in the clarifying solvents of tender sympathy and 
illuminating intelligence. The story is, of course, 
one of an unhappy mating. The heroine is a nur- 
sery governess who is so dazed by the suit of her 
elderly lover that her natural impulses do not assert 
themselves until after she has taken the fatal step. 
Her lordly husband is so sunk in the gratified con- 
templation of his own magnanimity that it is long 
before he realizes that it is not love, but gratitude 
and respectful submission, that he has brought to 
his hearthstone. When the awakening comes, he 
broods in silence, and, dying, leaves a will with a 
sting, namely, a provision that his widow shall bene- 
fit by his estate " so long as she remain chaste and 
unmarried." Yet he had been mistaken all the 



time in the object of his suspicions, for the young 
gentleman at whom the shaft is aimed had touched 
only the surface of the heroine's life, and her deeper 
self had all the time been in the custody of a vaga- 
bond acquaintance unknown to her husband. This 
character, a gentleman by birth and education, 
abandons the flesh-pots of comfort for the free life 
of the open road. He takes a tent and goes gypsy- 
ing : he tinkers kettles for a material living, but has 
for his real object in life the planting of strange 
plants in odd corners of England, converting their 
bareness into spots of blossoming beauty. This 
interesting and sympathetic figure, this man whom 
Thoreau would have taken to his heart, is the soul- 
mate of the heroine, and it is to him that she goes 
in the end, renouncing without a pang the life of 
luxurious ease that might yet be hers. The gypsy 
tent is the Halfway House of her experimental ex- 
ploration of the world of men, and it becomes the 
haven of her final refuge. This outline can give no 
notion whatever of the exquisite charm with which 
the tale is told. It has all the seeming simplicity 
of the finest literary art, but its wit, its gi'ace, and 
its subtle sentiment are qualities that make of it a 
far more serious book than it pretends to be. In it 
Mr. Hewlett has achieved a new sort of distinction, 
and made to his readers a more human appeal than 
ever before. William Morton Payne.

The palmy days ^^ ^^ ^^n years since Mr. Herbert 
of the American E. Hamblen's " On Many Seas " de- 
trading vessels, lighted readers of ocean adventure 
with its rapid and realistic account of the writer's 
experiences on the briny deep. And now there 
comes another autobiographic narrative, of very 
similar tone and of equal interest, from the pen of 
Captain John D. Whidden, entitled " Ocean Life in 
the Old Sailing-Ship Days " (Little, Brown & Co.). 
The same rough process of " breaking-in " as Mr. 
Hamblen's was undergone by the cabin-boy Whid- 
den, when, at thirteen years of age, and an orphan, 
he went aboard the clipper " Ariel " at Newburyport 
and began a seafaring life that culminated in the 
captaincy of the barque " Keystone," and included 
voyages to the far East and the far West and the 
Southern seas. The decline of our merchant ma- 
rine after the Civil War was the reason of Captain 
Whidden's retirement, after a quarter-century's ex- 
perience of seafaring. He deplores the war tariff 
which so raised the price of all shipping materials 
as to kill the New England ship-building industry. 
After reading the author's prefatory announcement 
that he knows nothing of book-writing, having left 
school at twelve and applied himself to matters 
wholly unconnected with literature, one is agreeably 
surprised to find his stii'ring narrative set forth in 
a fluent, clear, and pleasing style — a style that is 
certainly well suited to his purpose. It is to be

noted that in the account of his Eastern voyages 
Captain Whidden has repeated the old and all but 
baseless tradition of Juggernaut sacrifices. As was 
made clear years ago by Sir W. W. Hunter in his 
" Statistical Account of Bengal," and more recently 
by Moncure Conway in his book " My Pilgrimage to 
the Wise Men of the East," this tradition is based on 
an error. Juggernaut, or Jagannatha, who is none 
other than Vishnu the Preserver, under another 
form, is of course opposed to the taking of life of 
any kind, and especially the self-sacrifice of human 
beings. Captain Whidden's by no means puny pro- 
portions are partly presented in the frontispiece, and 
many other photogravures are scattered through 
the body of the book. As his old comrades would 
doubtless be glad to attest in his favor, the Captain 
spins a rattling good yarn, and we commend it to 
all lovers of sea stories.

will ensure a welcome for Mrs. Julia de Wolf 
Addison's " Arts and Crafts in the Middle Ages " 
(L. C. Page & Co. ). For it is to the Middle Ages 
that the modern movement looks back for its in- 
spiration as to the golden age of handicraft. Then, 
nobody could be a cog in the machine, no matter 
how much he might have preferred it; then, artist 
and artisan, designer and craftsman, were as a mat- 
ter of course one ; and this versatility, which often 
stretched itself to include half a dozen different 
artistic pursuits, if it thwarted cold perfection, im- 
pai'ted a charm of sincerity, na'ivetS, and individ- 
uality, that the most wonderful machine-made product 
must forever lack. It is of some of the work pro- 
duced under these conditions, which a school of 
modern artists is trying to recreate, that Mrs. 
Addison writes. Like her other art manuals, this 
one is intended for the amateur in such studies, who 
seeks the little general information that wiU make the 
collections in museums interesting and profitable, and 
lead to the reading of more detailed and comprehen- 
sive works. Accordingly there are brief and simple 
accounts of a dozen mediaeval crafts, practised ex- 
tensively in England, France, Germany, and Italy, 
with explanations of mechanical processes, descrip- 
tions, often accompanied by illustrations, of distin- 
guished examples, and quaint legends and anecdotes 
of famous craftsworkers and their patrons, generally 
kings or ecclesiastical dignitaries, themselves often 
practical artisans, teachers of guilds, or directors of 
craft shops. Chapters of varying length are devoted 
to the different crafts — metal work, including gold 
and silver work, that done in baser metals, and 
enameling ; tapestry ; embroidery ; sculpture in stone, 
limited to its decorative applications ; carving in wood 
and ivory; inlay and mosaic ; and illumination. Each 
art is treated independently, though the names of 
workers like Cellini and Bishop Bernward of Hilde- 
sheim recur in different chapters ; and more or less 
chronologically, though the emphasis is not upon 



progressive stages of development but rather upon 
typical examples of work and workers. Necessarily, 
the accounts are frag^mentaiy, but they serve their 
purpose, and a short but well-chosen bibliography 
furnishes material for amplification in any desired 
direction.

by Mr. Gladstone is becoming rarer every year. The 
bookishness, if not the statesmanship, of the great 
man was displayed to admiring and respectful 
observers on the occasion of his last visit but one at 
Oxford, in 1890, when, as honorary Fellow of All 
Souls, he was the guest of that college for a week 
in January and February. Letters descriptive of 
this notable event were written daily through the 
week by " C. R. L. F.," apparently the Warden of 
All Souls ; and some of these, with additions and 
notes, are now published under the title " Mr. 
Gladstone at Oxford, 1890 " (Button). Monologue 
and dialogue is reproduced in some detail, and the 
little book gives glimpses of Gladstone that one is 
thankful not to have missed. As to his manner in 
personal intercourse, we read : " The charm of his 
talk cannot be rendered in description — the soft- 
ness of the lower tones of the voice, the easy con- 
stant movement as he turned from one to the other ; 
the clenched fist, the open palm, and the challeng- 
ing forefinger, which the House of Commons knew 
so well. Sometimes he seemed to drop out of the 
conversation, his eye looked veiled and tired; but 
at the first sound of a name that appealed to him, 
the veil seemed to lift, and he was watching the 
moment to speak." And of his appearance : " All 
his portraits make him too fierce. There is great 
nobUity and play of face, as well as of gesture with 
the hands, which he is fond of bringing down plump 
on the table to emphasize a point. . . . Eyes grey- 
blue, and though occasionally they light up so much 
as to be describable as ' fierce,' in ordinary conver- 
sation they are essentially mild," Gladstone's 
inclination to discourse on Homer and on Greek 
archaeology appears to have bored his hearers a 
little, especially as they felt themselves not well 
prepared to contribute to the conversation. A 
number of the stories told by Mr. Gladstone are to 
be found in the " Life," as is duly pointed out in 
footnotes. A portrait of the distinguished guest in 
academic gown faces the title-page ; another picture 
of him, with Mrs. Gladstone standing at his side, is 
inserted later ; and we are favored with an outside 
view of the college rooms occupied by him during 

his visit. -

gan shute was occasionally erected to accentuate the 
already sharp descent at the beginning, and the 
speed attained was truly terrific. This and other 
sports and games that flourished on the Common 
when the nineteenth century was a hale and hearty 
sexagenarian are agreeably recalled and described 
by one who was a participant in them, Mr. James 
D'Wolf Lovett, bis book bearing the title, "Old 
Boston Boys and the Games they Played." The book 
had its genesis at a dinner given by the late Samuel 
Cabot, himself one of "the old boys," to a number 
of friends and contemporaries who had once been 
prominent oarsmen, cricketers, baseball and football 
players, boxers, gymnasts, or otherwise athletically 
distinguished. The memories there recalled, with 
the records and remembrances of Mr. Lovett him- 
self, have been generously drawn upon to make a 
book of unique interest — marred only by the 
modesty of the author, who was a ball-player and 
athlete of great prowess, but gives the reader only a 
hint here and there of his achievements. For the 
history of cricket, football, baseball, and rowing, Mr. 
Lovett's chapters are of value ; and as giving a pic- 
ture of mid-nineteenth-century open-air pastimes in 
Boston, they are highly entertaining. Coming from 
one who assisted at the birth of our national game, 
and was himself a redoubtable pitcher, what is re- 
corded about baseball cannot fail to find interested 
readers among present-day enthusiasts. One small 
error, or seeming error, noteworthy because so un- 
expected, may be mentioned. In commenting on 
the unvarying order of boys' games, the year round, 
Mr. Lovett makes marbles come after tops. Is it 
possible that the present cheerful sign of spring, the 
nimble marble, has not always made its appearance 
with the retreat of snow and mud ? The book's 
many illustrations from old photographs form a valu- 
able part of its contents. Two drawings by Mr. C. D. 
Gibson are also provided. (Little, Brown & Co.) 

A French view '^^^ queer fascination that Beau 
of an English Brummell exercised in his lifetime 
6mM and dandy, still ^ij^gg ^o his memory. Vain, 
shallow, impertinent, heartless, a spendthrift and a 
bully, he played his game of life with superb impu- 
dence and crafty abandon, making snobbery a sys- 
tem, insolence a fine art, and frivolity heroic. His 
genius was essentially un-English, — one reason, no 
doubt, why he domineered so easily over the bril- 
liant, flippant, immoral society of his day, with its 
aspiration toward Gallic standards that it lacked the 
refinement fully to understand. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that this chief of the English beaux has 
had more than one French biographer. The latest 
of these is M. Roger Boutet de Monvel, who has 
produced a delightfully picturesque and sympathetic 
study, etched on the background of contemporary 
English life. It is entitled "Beau Brummell and 
His Times" (Lippincott). The prefatory history 
of dandyism in Europe is entertaining, and the trans- 
lation of the text is adequate, though at times rather 
self-conscious. M. de Monvel has been particularly 



successful in selecting, from the mass of anecdotage 
available, bits that really illuminate his subject. 
Where an English biographer of to-day would have 
been likely to offer every item he could lay hands 
on, M. de Monvel has chosen to work on a smaller, 
better proportioned canvas, deftly avoiding too fa- 
miliar and too numerous instances of the Beau's 
conspicuous traits, and not failing to bring out the 
less-known sides of his enigmatical character. His 
perfect understanding of himself and his methods, 
for example, is shown in his conversations with the 
eccentric Lady Hester Stanhope, where he was 
clever enough to be as frank in his answers as she 
was direct in her attacks. And his real humor, his 
air of courtesy, and his gift for talking amiably with 
everybody, as the poet Crabbe bore witness to them, 
are not forgotten. The book is elegantly printed 
and bound, and is illustrated with portraits of the 
Beau and of some of his companions and admirers. 



The real 
Francesca 
of Dante, 



In a neat little volume, Mr. Harold 
Harris Mathew offers to English 
readers, through the press of David 
Nutt, an adaptation of the work of Monsieur Charles 
Yriarte on Francesca di Rimini. After a rather 
careful review of the evidence the author comes to 
this belief: Francesca, daughter of the Lord of 
Ravenna, was about eighteen when, in 1275, she 
was married by proxy to Giovanni, who was over 
thirty. Her married life lasted ten years ; and she 
had one daughter. She was a woman "of lofty 
spirit" and resolute energy. Her intimacy with 
Paolo was of long standing. Paolo's main charac- 
teristic is summed up in "II Bello." Six years 
before meeting Francesca he had married ; and his 
wife had two children. Giovanni was the tradi- 
tional shrewd soldier-politician of the period, whose 
physical deformities did not interfere with his per- 
sistent activities. The day after he murdered his 
wife and brother he married one Zambrasina. So 
much for the probable verities. In the conclusion, 
however, this wise sentence is penned : " But when 
all is said, it is useless to file our evidence, and 
search all possible sources of information to dis- 
cover the real Francesca, for Dante has superseded 
history." The book seems to us to serve its purpose 
well ; and its ninety-four small pages will do much 
to orientate the reader who is following the many 
and various writings that centre about Dante's " two 
sad spirits indivisible." 

Letters by the A. volume of the characteristic and 

author of the . , . , p -r-i i it 

"Nonsense amusing letters ot Edward Lear, 

Verses." which was published awhile ago in 

London, now appears in an American edition (Duf- 
field & Co.), with some revision and correction by 
the editor. Lady Strachey. The letters extend from 
1847 to 1864, are written from different places 
visited by the wandering landscape-painter, and are 
mostly addressed to his friend Fortesque (Lady 
Strachey 's uncle), with a few to Lady Waldegrave, 
who married Fortesque in 1863. Hasty drawings,

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



of characteristic whimsicality, form no unimportant 
part of the letters ; and, as was to be expected from 
this pioneer " limerickian," he occasionally drops 
into that form of verse. As an example of his in- 
formal letter- writing style — and it may be doubted 
whether he had any formal style — let us quote a few 
lines disclaiming his intention ever to marry. *' Single 
— I may have few pleasures — but married — many 
risks and miseries are semi-certainly in waiting — 
nor till the plot is played out can it be said that evils 
are not at hand. You say you are 30, but I believe 
you are ever so much more. As for me I am 40 — 
and some months : by the time I am 42 I shall regard 
the matter with 42de I hope." His punning use of 
the numbers four and forty is frequent, especially 
in the name of his friend, — "40scue." Snatches 
of modern Greek, chiefly in letters from Greece, add 
variety to these never monotonous missives, and 
one of them contains a translation of Tennyson's 
"Will." Lear died in 1888, in his seventy-sixth 
year. Letters covering the period 1864-88 are in 
Lady Strachey's possession, and she half promises 
to publish them if the sale of the first inst^ment is 
sufficiently encouraging. — Simultaneously with the 
edition of Lear's letters appears a reprint of his 
"Book of Limericks" (Little, Brown & Co.), with 
Lear's own delightfully humorous Ulustrations. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Notes. 



The latest g^ide to the mysteries of the culinary art 
is " The Standard Domestic Science Cook Book," com- 
piled and arranged by William H. Lee and Jennie A. 
Hansey, and published by Messrs. Laird & Lee of 
Chicago. It contains over 1400 recipes, all of which 
the authors vouch for as tried and true, menus for all 
seasons, and diverse directions for marketing, carving, 
serving meals, entertaining, and so on. A chapter on the 
fireless cooker attests to the thoroughly up-to-date char- 
acter of the suggestions. Each g^oup of recipes is 
headed by a brief paragraph explaining how to distin- 
guish wholesome from unwholesome foodstuffs of the 
particular kind under discussion, this feature giving the 
book its distinctive title. A decided novelty is the 
thumb index, which enables the hiuried and possibly | 
sticky-fingered cook to turn at once to any of the thirty- \ 
two departments of the book, merely by reference to j 
the department index compactly printed inside the front j 
cover. A special leather-bound "gift edition" of the 
book has been issued along with the regular one. ! 

Miss Katherine L. Sharp, formerly librarian and 
library school director at the University of Illinois, has | 
issued (through the University Press, Urbaua, 111.) the 
fourth part of her detailed account of " Ulinois Libra- j 
ries." This section is entitled " Chicago Libraries," I 
and in the space of 140 pages chronicles the history of 
no fewer than 102 extant and four obsolete libraries — 
unless our counting is at fault. There is no sufficient 
table of contents, and no index whatever, even though 
the author is a professional librarian ! However, there 
is promise of a complete index to the entire work, as 
well as views of buildings and a list of Illinois library 
publications — to be comprised in a fifth and final 
brochure or "part." 



"Twelve Thousand Words Often Mispronounced," 
by Mr. William Henry P. Phyfe, is a revision of a 
well-known hand-book, now enlarged to the extent of 
twenty per cent. Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are the 
publishers. 

Ten « Stories New and Old," by English and Ameri- 
can writers, are collected into a volume and published 
by the Macmillan Co. Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie 
appears as the sponsor, and writes a brief uitroduction 
for each of the ten. 

Two new Baedekers, now imported by the Messrs. 
Scribner, are the fifteenth revised edition of " London 
and Its Environs," and the third edition of "Berlin 
and Its Environs." Both voliunes are brought up to 
date, and provided with new maps and plans. 

" Japanese Folk Stories and Fairy Tales," by Mrs. 
Mary F. Nixon-Roulet, and « Chinese Fables and Folk 
Stories," by Miss Mary Hayes Davis and Mr. Chow 
Leung, are two volmnes of the " Eclectic Readings " 
for schools published by the American Book Co. 

Messrs. Doubleday, Page & Co. publish pretty new 
editions, in limp leather covers, of Mr. Kipling's " Plain 
Tales from the Hills " and " Departmental Ditties and 
Barrack Room Ballads." The former volume has a 
biographical sketch by Professor Charles Eliot Norton. 

The Columbia University Press issues in handsome 
form a monograph, by Miss Virginia Crocheron Gilder- 
sleeve, on " Government Regulation of the Elizabethan 
Drama." The study is based largely upon official doc- 
uments of the time, and is a very thorough piece of 
work. 

No less than eight authors have contributed to " A 
Text-Book of Physics," now published by Messrs. P. 
Blakiston's Son & Co. Professor A. Wilmer Duff is 
the general editor of the work and the author of the 
section upon " Mechanics." The book has upwards of 
five hundred illustrations. 

A second edition, completely revised throughout, of 
Dr. Masuji Miyakawa's " Powers of the American 
People " is published by the Baker & Taylor Co. As 
the work of a Japanese scholar, this book is of peculiar 
interest, particularly because it introduces many instruc- 
tive comparisons between the Japanese and American 
Constitutions. 

" Much Adoe about Nothing," edited by Mr. W. G. 
Boswell-Stone, and " The Merry Wives of Windsor," 
edited by Dr. F. J. Furnivall, are the latest volumes in 
the " Old-Spelling Shakespeare," published by Messrs. 
Duffield & Co. To the series of " Shakespeare Classics " 
the same publishers have added " The Sources and 
Analogues of * A Midsummer-Night's Dream,' " a vol- 
ume compiled by Mr. Frank Sidgwick. 

Arthur Stedman, the younger of the two sons of 
Edmund Clarence Stedman, and the only one living at 
the time of the poet's death, passed away on the 16th 
of September. He was forty-nine years old and a Yale 
graduate of '81. The greater part of his life was spent 
in New York, in which city he died. He was an indus- 
trious literary worker, and wrote much for newspapers 
and magazines. He was of much assistance to his father 
in the preparation of the "Library of American Litera- 
ture." He will also be remembered as having written, 
in the early nineties, the regular New York letter of 
literary news which appeared in this journal.

MILTON AS A SCHOOLMASTER 

John Milton was born in, London in 1608, just three cen- 
turies ago, his birthday being December 9. One interesting 
and useful recognition of the ter-centenary, which will be 
valued especially by our teachers, is the publication by the 
directors of the Old South work in Boston, as one of their 
large series of Old South Leaflets, of Milton's famous little 
treatise on Education. A most remarkable treatise this was 
for its time.

TWO NEW BOOKS OF PERMANENT VALUE 

Just Published — J NEW VOLUME OF THE VARIORIUM SHAKESPEARE 

The Tragedy of Richard the Third 

Edited by HORACE HOWARD FURNESS, Jr. 

nPHOSE interested in the study of Shakespeare's plays will recall that a few years ago 

Horace Howard Furness, Jr., prepared a revision of his father's Variorum edition of 

Macbeth," which was most favorably received by Shakespearean critics. It manifested 

ability and scholarship, and demonstrated the wisdom of Dr. Furness in associating his son 

with this invaluable work, so stupendous as to be beyond the ability of a lifetime to complete. 

The new volume is " The Tragedy of Richard the Third," edited by Horace Howard 
Furness, Jr., and brings the total number of volumes to sixteen. 

The text of this edition follows the text of the First Folio, and in addition there are 
Textual Notes showing the different readings and variations from the other folios and quartos. 

The appendix contains the stage history of the play; a discussion on Richard's 
deformity — a timely article in view of the renewed interest in that subject brought about 
by the recent publication of Sir Clements Markham's "Richard III.: His Life and 
Character," etc. 

With frontispiece. Royal 8vo. Cloth, gilt top, uncut edges, $4.00 net; 
three-quarter levant, $5.00 net. Postage, 30 cents extra.

The 

Struggle for American Independence 

By SYDNEY GEORGE FISHER 

Author of " The True History of the American Revolution, ^^ 
The True Benjamin Franklin,'' etc. 

\ COMPREHENSIVE history of the whole revolutionary movement from a point of 

view quite different from the usual one. A great deal of the original evidence, which 
has heretofore been ignored by historians, is brought to light and made accessible to the 
ordinary reader. 

" He makes his points clearly and writes in a thoroughly readable style." — Neiv York Sun. 

' ' Mr. Fisher has gradually worked his way into the front ranks of living American historians. ' ' — Portland 
Oregonian. 

" He has given a far truer picture of the Revolutionary War than any of his predecessors in the study of 
that most fateful period in British and American history." — Toronto Globe. 

" A book that no student can overlook, and in which the ' general reader' will find a fund of informa- 
tion — drawn from close documentaiy study — -never before placed so intelligently within his reach." — Phila- 
delphia Public Ledger. 

" Mr. Fisher's style is limpid and lucid, his narrative is interesting, and since he quotes his authorities 
page by page his novel thesis will not readily be dismissed. His volumes cannot be overlooked by anyone who 
wishes to be well informed upon the origins and fundamentals of our nation or the future of England's colonial 
relations." — Ne-iv York Times Saturday Re'vieiv of Books.

NOW READY— THE GREAT NEW NOVEL 
First 

^fj^^^g The Trail of the Lonesome Pine 



Copies 



Author of 



By JOHN FOX, Jr. 

' The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come ' 



lUus. $1.50. 



T^HIS great new novel by John Fox is more than a story of feuds and fighting in the Kentucky 
* mountains. It is, above all, the story of the growth and development of a peculiarly fine and 
attractive mountain girl, " June," a most fascinating and picturesque heroine who added the training of 
the cities to the charm of the mountains, and of the young engineer himself, John Hale, a brave, energetic 
impetuous, rarely fine, vigorous man of flesh and blood, of triumphs and mistakes. 

In this splendid story John Fox rises to a power of description, to an expression of dramatic force 
and profound feeling, that make a novel which exceeds in strength and beauty even " The Little Shepherd 
of Kingdom Come."

THE FAMOUS "TOLD TO THE CHILDREN'' series 

Bold Type, Simple Language. Eight Colored Pictures in Elach Volume. 
In Cloth, Gilt, with Picture Design. 

FIFTY CENTS PER VOLUME 

" These are the beginnings, we hope, of an ideal child's library of story books. The shortening and 
simplification of the originals have been admirably done, the print is a pleasure to read, and the spirited 
colored illustrations, one of which figures on the dainty cover of each volume, should suffice to tempt even 
the least bookish of the little ones to start upon a voyage of exploration inside." 

The stories are culled from such sources as the Annals of Robin Hood, Morte d'Arthur and Chaucer, 
and are told in the simple language of those who understand the need and capacity of the child mind. 
The aim has been to select only what will interest, and to present it in the simplest possible form, while 
preserving something of the original atmosphere. 

THIS SERIES IS EDITED BY LOUEY CHISHOLM 
Each volume is illustrated by well-known artists, including Byam Shaw, F. D. Bedford, A. S. Forrest,

Molmenti's " VENICE " 

Is now complete with the pubHcation of 

Part in. The Decadence of Venice 

THE PRECEDING SECTIONS ARE: 

Part I. Venice in the Middle Ages 
Part II. Venice in the Golden Age 

Translated from the Italian by HORATIO F. BROWN 

THE Third Part, just published, completes this most important work, which needs 
no introduction to the public. The Chicago Record-Herald says: '' fVith the 
' Decadence of Venice ' in two volumes, the most exhaustive and remarkable book ever 
made accessible to English readers of Venetian history is brought to a fitting conclusion ^ 

Each of the three parts deals with one of the three great periods in the life of this 
wonderful city and is complete in itself. The First Part deals with the humble origin, the 
weary struggle for existence, and the austere grandeur of the Middle Ages ; the Second, 
with the splendour of the Golden Age when Venice held her own against the allied powers 
at Cambray and won the famous victory at Lepanto, when through Navagero, Bembo, the 
Barbaro family, Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese, and Aldus Manutius, she gave to all Europe 
the thought of three civilizations in one in her radiant dream of beauty. 

In the Third Part comes the decline, the decadence ; the most serene Republic reaches 
the end of its history. But a golden halo surrounds even the old age and decay of the 
Queen of the Adriatic ; grace and beauty still compose her wealth and power ; free from 
vulgarity, never dependent, never a vassal, she remains her own mistress. When the hour 
arrives, the glorious Republic disappears from time and history, as the sun at the end of a 
long day sinks from sight behind the mists of the sea. 

" Altogether, cannot be commended too highly." — The Bookman. 

" One may place these volumes in good faith on the shelves writh those histories which endure the test 
of time." — Chicago Tribune. 

" Unquestionably the most complete and authoritative history of the Venetian people ever written." 
— Chicago "B^ecord-Herald. 

"The admirable illustrations have been chosen with such fine judgment that they really illustrate the 
subjects touched upon." — Neijj York Post. 

" The typographical beauty of these volumes, with the admirable binding, adds a worthy chapter to the 
history of American publishing." — Publishers Weekly. 

These volumes are probably the most elaborate and instructive 
yet written on Venetian manners and customs, and in addition 
are handsomely printed and bound. Each section of two volumes, 
8v0y net $5.00; postage, 30 cts. The complete set, net $15.00.

Economic Prizes 



FIFTH YEAR 

In order to arouse an interest in the study of topics relating to commerce and industry, and to 
stimulate those who have a college training to consider the problems of a business career, a committee 
composed of 

Professor J. Laurence Laughlin, University of Chicago, Cheurman; 

Professor J. B. Clark, Columbia University; 

Professor Henry C. Adams, University of Michigan; 

Horace White, Esq., New York City, and 

Hon. Carroll D. Wright, Clark College, 

have been enabled, through the generosity of Messrs. Hart, Schaffner & Marx, of Chicago, to offer in 1909 
prizes under two general heads. Attention is expressly called to a new rule that a competitor is not 
confined to subjects mentioned in this announcement; but any other subject chosen must first be approved 
by the Committee. 

I. Under the first head are suggested herewith a few subjects intended primarily for 
those who have had an academic training ; but the possession of a degree is not required 
of any contestant, nor is any age limit set. 

1. German and American methods of regulating tnists. 

2. The logic of " Progress and Poverty." 

3. What are the ultimate ends of trade-unions, and can these be gained by any application of the 

principles of monopoly ? 

4. In view of existing railway progress, should the United States encourage the construction of 

waterways ? 

6. Is it to be expected that the present and recent production of gold will cause a higher level of prices? 

Under this head, Class A includes any American without restriction; and Class B includes only 
those who, at the time the papers are sent in, are undergraduates of any American college. Any member 
of Class B may compete for the prizes of Class A. 

A First Prize of Six Hundred Dollars, and 
A Second Prize of Four Hundred Dollars 

are offered for the best studies presented by Class A, and 

A First Prize of Three Hundred Dollars, and 
A Second Prize of Two Hundred Dollars 

are offered for the best studies presented by Class B. The committee reserves to itself the right to 
award the two prizes of $600 and $400 of Class A to undergraduates in Class B, if the merits of the 
papers demand it. 

II. Under the second head are suggested some subjects intended for those who may 
not have had an academic training, and who form Class C : 

1. The best scheme for uniform corporation accounts. 

2. Desirable methods of improving our trade with China. 

3. The proper spheres of the trust company and the commercial bank. 

4. The relations of oriental immigration to American industries. 

6. The relative efficiency of American and European labor in manufacturing industries. 

One Prize of Five Hundred Dollars 

is offered for the best study presented by Class C ; but any member of Class C may compete in Class A, 

The ownership of the copyright of successful studies will vest in the donors, and it is expected that, without pre- 
cluding the use of these papers as theses for higher degrees, they will cause them to be issued in some permanent form. 

Competitors are advised that the studies should be thorough, expressed in good English, and although not limited 
as to length, they should not be needlessly expanded. They should be inscribed with an assumed name, the class in which 
they are presented, and accompanied by a sealed envelope giving the real name and address of the competitor. If the 
competitor is in Class B, the sealed envelope should contain the name of the institution in which he is studying. The 
papers should be sent on or before June 1. 1909, to

HUMANISM IN EDUCATION. 



When Pope declared that " The proper study 
of mankind is man," he formulated a maxim 
rather than a definite pedagogical prescription. 
But many of us, who have been wandering for 
a generation in the educational wilderness, find- 
ing its desert tracts more and more arid, its 
oases and refreshing springs less and less fre- 
quent, feel inclined to make the familiar quota- 
tion a sort of slogan in the warfare upon the 
Philistinism which at present prevails in our 
educational systems and institutions. It takes 
courage nowadays to make a bold stand for the 
humanities, because most people have the curious 
idea that education is chiefly desirable as a 
means of enabling young men to make money, 
and regard as a product of crack-brained fanat- 
icism the notion that its primary purpose is to 
enrich the individual with wealth of deepened 
sympathies, and the knowledge, cherished on 
its own account, that slowly ripens into wisdom. 
If there is any precept that needs to be im- 
pressed upon our practically-minded educators 
it is that they should take 

" Good heed 
Lest, having spent for the work's sake 
Six days, the man be left to make." 

If we turn to the poets, those unfailing 
sources of helpfulness in our need for guidance 
in the rightful ordering of life, and in the diffi- 
cult matter of learning what its realities are, we 
shall find no lack of wise counsel. Emerson, 
for example, will furnish us with this pithy 
fragment : 

" There are two laws discrete 

Not reconciled, — 

Law for man, and law for thing; 

The last builds town and fleet. 

But it runs wild. 

And doth the man unking." 

Professor Irving Babbitt makes the happy 
choice of this text for his recent volume of essays 
on " Literature and the American College," a 
volume which voices once more, and with singu- 
larly persuasive effect, the plea for things 
spiritual in our educational systems. He is one 
of those who realize how astonishingly bad a 
bargain it must be to gain the whole world and 
lose one's own soul, and he gives us once more, 
reinforced by fresh illustrative material, the old 



238 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



unanswerable argument for humanistic culture. 
He does not hesitate to suggest that the dilet- 
tante is a more admirable product of college 
training than the philologist. " He is almost a 
dilettante — he reads Dante and Shakespeare," 
was the contemptuous way in which one of his 
philologist friends once described a colleague ; 
and Mr. Babbitt does not shrink from accepting 
the challenge thus implied. He has noticed, he 
says, " in philologists a curious predilection for 
vaudeville performances and light summer fic- 
tion," and even if the dilettante has " given 
evidence of nothing except perhaps a gentle 
epicureanism," the pores of his perceptive con- 
sciousness have not been quite clogged up by 
pedantry. 

The scholar who couches a lance in the defence 
of humanism will find giants in his path, seem- 
ingly as terrible as the guardians of Doubting 
Castle in the allegory, and really, perhaps, quite 
as impotent to impede his progress. One of 
these educational monsters is the elective system, 
which is thus neatly disposed of : 

" If some of our educational radicals have their way, 
the A.B. degree will mean merely that a man has ex- 
pended a certain number of units of intellectual energy 
on a list of elective studies that may range from boiler- 
making to Bulgarian; the degree will simply serve to 
measure the amount and intensity of one's intellectual 
current and the resistance overcome; it will become, in 
short, a question of intellectual volts and amperes and 
ohms. . . . The rank of studies will finally be deter- 
mined, not by the number of intellectual foot-pounds 
they involve, but bj the nearness or remoteness of these 
studies to man, the boundaries of whose being by no 
means coincide with those of physical nature." 

Fortimately, there are signs that this particular 
form of educational foolishness is losing its in- 
fluence. It has weakened the fibre of a whole 
generation of young people, but its excesses have 
proved its undoing, and we are recovering some- 
thing of our lost sense of measure and relative 
values. 

The other monsters that the humanist has to 
confront are chiefly those which represent the 
two ideals of materialism and of pedantry. If 
left alone, they might destroy each other in time, 
for their objects are absolutely irreconcilable. 
But it is just as well to hasten the process of 
their dissolution by a few weU-directed lance 
thrusts. It requires only a slight infusion of 
rationality into the discussion to make clear that 
the ideal of money-getting and the ideal of 
knowledge-getting are alike empty, are alike 
unworthy of being thought the ultimate aims of 
education. There is to be found to-day in most 
of our colleges " a literature ancient and modern 
controlled by a philological syndicate, a history 



dehumanized by the abuse of scientific method, 
and a political economy that has never been 
humane." This situation must be fairly faced, 
but it need not be the occasion for utter despair, 
because it is a situation so revolting to the deep 
instinctive sense of all who have the true inter- 
ests of humanity at heart that it may yield to a 
few resolute assaults. The fable of the one 
strong man who shattered the supports of the 
ancient temple of philistinism may sometime 
find its modern educational analogue. Neither 
Dryasdust nor the Spencerian utilitarian can 
escape from rout when humanism takes the field 
in earnest against them. 

History, philosophy, and the fine arts are the 
agencies whereby the highest educational results 
are reached. We do not undervalue the dis- 
cipline of natural science, but are compelled to 
consider its educational service as ancillary. As 
a preparation for bread-winning, it performs a 
serviceable function, but one that has little to do 
with education as we woidd define the term. But 
in its reaction upon the student's envisagement 
of nature, and upon the modes of his thought 
concerning human life, it contributes to his 
training an important element. It helps him 
to weigh evidence, it deepens his devotion to 
truth, and it strengthens his understanding. 
It may add a new charm to natural beauty, it 
may enrich the aesthetic sense, and it may invest 
conduct with a deeper significance. But with 
all these ministries to its credit, it remains of 
secondary importance, educationally considered, 
because its primary concern is with things and 
not with men. In literature, on the other hand, 
all the humanistic agencies are at work, for it 
ignores nothing that concerns mankind as a 
spiritual being. 

Since the rays of light which constitute 
essential humanity — rays intellectual, asstheti- 
cal, and ethical — are thus focussed in litera- 
ture, it is obvious that literature, in a very 
broad sense, must be the chief concern of edu- 
cation. And this concern should determine 
the beginnings of education no less than its 
higher reaches. An admirable little book by 
Professor John Harrington Cox on " Literature 
in the Common Schools " emphasizes this aspect 
of the question. "The hunger to know the 
meaning of life is almost as primal as the 
hunger for food," this writer says ; and the all- 
comprehending character of literature, which 
makes it equally needful for young and old, is 
well expressed in the following sentences : 

« Within its pages is to be found the deepest and 
truest revelation that the race has made of itself. Here

the seers of the world have recorded their flashes of 
insight. The answers of the universe to man's fervid, 
persistent questionings are written here. The agony of 
the human soul in its endeavor to fathom the mysteries 
of existence is engraven on its pages. The intellect has 
ransacked every sphere, from the lowest to the empy- 
rean, to enrich its story. Its chief function is to lay 
bare the wisdom of the heart, purified of its dross by 
the masterful creative imagination of men." 

We cannot begin too early to lay in the child's 
mind those foundations of sympathy and un- 
derstanding which are to be the true life of the 
man when he is grown ; we cannot take too 
great pains with our bricks and mortar in these 
beginnings of a structure that may in later 
years weigh heavily upon its base. 

That our schools first of all, and our colleges 
later on, are making a sorry mess of this busi- 
ness, is acknowledged by practically all com- 
petent judges. And this in spite of the fact, 
as Professor John Erskine says in a recent 
article, that " literature presents to the boy the 
most directly human subject matter in the cur- 
riculum," and that " he will find that work and 
play coincide as nearly as may be in this crude 
world, when he sits down to read Fielding, or 
Scott, or Dickens." The trouble is that the 
boy is not encouraged to do this simple and joy- 
ful thing ; he is instead set to studying notes, 
and writing callow accounts of his impressions, 
and cramming for examinations. Better drop 
literature from school altogether than confine it 
in this straight- jacket of pedantry. " Should 
not the first principle of teaching literature be 
to discover what prevents the life-loving youth 
from seeing the life stored up in these books as 
yet dead for him ? Should not the second prin- 
ciple be to remove that obstacle ? If there is 
a third principle, should it not be to see that 
the student reads as many books as possible ? " 
To these pertinent questions of Mr. Erskine the 
affirmative answer is the only one possible, in 
our way of thinking. Thus the teacher may be 
actively engaged in advancing that consummation 
so devoutly to be wished, in realizing that ideal 
condition phrased by Professor George Wood- 
berry, " when the best that has anywhere been 
in the world shall be the portion of every man 
bom into it." 

A NEWLY-DISCOVERED manuscript of Victor Hugo's 
has attracted attention, and its discoverer, M. Gustave 
Simon, who is also custodian of the Hugo manuscripts, 
is publishing a series of articles on it in Les Annales 
Politiques et Litteraires. This literary treasure trove — 
if it shall prove to be a treasure — is a preface to Les 
Miserables. That it has been deemed worthy of de- 
tailed treatment at M. Sunon's hands seems to indicate 
that it contains matter of importance. 



SOME HI NDOO DRAMAS. 

India had what may properly be called a ro- 
mantic drama before any European nation. The 
Greek and Latin plays dealt, of course, with nature 
and humanity ; and all that concerns man and the 
world may be found in them, in germ at least. 
But they turned away by choice from some aspects 
of our common life. In tragedy, they held to high 
and stern themes ; in comedy, they dwelt on low and 
base ones, — and they did not mix the two. The 
notes of the modern Romantic drama are, perhaps, 
chiefly these : the immense development of Love — 
the love of man and maid — as the central feature 
of the plot; the increased use of natural scenery 
and phenomena toned in sympathy with the action 
or moods of the actors ; the admixture of tragedy 
and comedy throughout each work — the ideal and 
the real walking arm in sirm, as it were ; and, finally, 
a loose, rambling texture of plot, defiant of the unities 
of time and place. These notes, sign alike of the 
work of Shakespeare, of Calderon, and of Goethe, 
are all exactly anticipated in the Hindoo plays whose 
date may be anywhere from the beginning of our 
era to the year eight or nine hundred. 

The rise of the Hindoo drama seems to reverse 
the usual progress of an art form in any literature. 
As a rule, the sublime, the tragic, the irregular 
master comes first ; then the more perfect and mod- 
erate artist, and last of all the realist and comedian. 
But here the Menander-like author of "The Little 
Clay Cart " is the earliest ; and following him comes 
Kalidasa, the maker of beautiful visions, soft, gentle, 
artistic ; while at the end, after the lapse of centuries, 
rises the great and appalling tragedian Bhavabhuti, 
the Hindoo ^Eschylus. 

If King Shudraka was the real as well as the 
reputed author of "The Little Clay Cart," he must 
have had a liking for low life which would class him 
with the Sultan of " The Arabian Nights." Cour- 
tesans, gamblers, thieves, cowherds, officers of the 
guard, and executioners, move across the scene. In 
variety and vigor of portrayal, in sheer vividness as 
of life itself, the play has no rival in ancient liter- 
ature, and is not surpassed by the best of its kind in 
Shakespeare or Goethe or Burns. There is the gam- 
bler Samvahaka, who is pursued by two keepers 
of a gambling-house to whom he owes money, and 
who is rescued by another gambler. There is the 
thief Savilaka, who breaks into a house with a dis- 
play of all the rules of his art and the procedures 
of logic. There are the officers of the guard, who 
quarrel with each other while they let Aryaka, the 
cowherd who is destined to be King, escape. All 
are depicted with the startling effect of truth which 
comes from the proper use of the exaggerations 
of art. 

To modern taste, the blot upon the piece is the 
profession of Vasantasena. She is a courtesan who 
has acquired an immense fortune, but has conceived 
a pure love for Charudatta, an unfortunate Brahman.

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



Generally, Hindoo literature is as careful of the 
purity of its heroines as is English literature at its 
best. The woman with a past, the theme of three, 
have no place in their poetry. But there are two 
remarkable exceptions — Draupadi, the heroine of 
the Mahabharata, who is married to the five Pandu 
brothers ; and Vasantasena. In the case of the 
latter, though there is some pretty plain language 
addressed to her, and though her wealth and the 
sources of it are plainly indicated, we can shut our 
eyes to her bad repute. She is so beautiful, so 
gentle, so generous, and so devoted, and she passes 
through such an ordeal to win her love, that in the 
end she rises in our minds a sister to Imogen her- 
self. 

The play, indeed, has a haunting resemblance to 
" Cymbeline " in incident and character. The great 
figure of the piece — Samsthanaka, the King's 
brother-in-law, who persecutes Vasantasena with his 
love and tries to do her to death — is Cloten in a 
previous incarnation. There is not a mere family 
resemblance, as between many figures of fiction, but 
the characters are identical. If anything, the sweep 
and power of the creation is greater in the Hindoo 
play. Vain, boastful, ignorant, cruel, cowardly, 
horrible, and deadly, Samsthanaka is a supreme 
triumph of dramatic projection, flawless from the 
first word he utters to the last. 

The deep feeling for natural scenery which char- 
acterizes Hindoo poetry beyond all the utterances of 
the Romantic Muse, comes out in this play in two 
scenes, one of which describes a great storm of the 
rainy season, which sends Vasantasena into Charu- 
datta's garden ; the other exhibits a public park 
where Vasantasena is apparently done away with. 
In both cases the scenery is by way of contrast to 
the action, — the dark approach and tumultuous 
dashing of the tropic rain driving the lovers into 
each other's arms, and the grim murder of the girl 
being set against the smiling beauty of the garden. 
Another very famous scene of the play shows 
Matreya, Charudatta's friend, led through the eight 
courts of Vasantasena's palace. The scene is un- 
dramatic, but the glittering words in which the 
riches of the house are described add to the vivid- 
ness and lifelikeness of the whole play. In general, 
the conduct of the scenes, though often impossible 
to our ideas of theatrical effect, is essentially dra- 
matic. The interest is sustained and the suspense 
kept up to the final word. The unravelment in 
the last act is better handled than in most of 
Shakespeare's comedies or romances. To sum up, 
the author of "The Little Clay Cart" was surpassed 
in verbal poetry, philosophy, and tragic situations, 
by Kalidasa and Bhavabhuti ; but as a creator of 
character he is unrivalled in the Hindoo drama, and 
can lean across the centuries and shake hands with 
Shakespeare and Goethe. 

It was the luck of Kalidasa to be the first revealed 
of all the Hindoo poets to the Western world. The 
charm and perfection of " Sakuntala " got him 



the title of " the Hindoo Shakespeare." To my 
mind, Shelley would be a closer comparison. Both 
are poets of aerial distances, of clouds, sunsets, 
forests, groves, caves. Their human beings are 
the embodiments of these things, and can hardly 
be separated from the natural phenomena amid 
which they move. A celestial ichor, rather than 
human blood, runs in the veins of Kalidasa's per- 
sonages. These are gods, nymphs, heroes, hermits, 
and the like. They are dazzling, beautiful, tender, 
but homely human nature seems to have little part 
in them. They are all one family with the mountain 
heights, the clouds, groves, flowers, and animals, 
with which they have their home. The result is a 
debauch of beauty, an intoxication of the senses 
of vision, hearing, smell, but a woeful lack of heart- 
gripping, mind-thrilling passion. Even the tragic 
situations lose force because of their unreality or 
extra mundane quality. When Dushyanta rejects 
Sakuntala, it is most like the separation of two 
clouds which the winds have driven apart. When 
the King takes arms at the command of Indra against 
the Demons, we do not believe in his warlike prowess, 
— for how could Demons exist in such a soft and 
unnerved world ? 

Yet "Sakuntala" is the loveliest flower of the 
Hindoo drama. The play opens in a bold and strik- 
ing way. Dushyanta, an Indian King, is hunting 
in the lower slopes of the Himalayas, and, following 
a deer, has entered the precincts of a sacred grove. 
He sees Sakuntala, the daughter of the hermitage, 
and falls in love with her. The ensuing scenes of 
the wooing are not wanting in humor, but their chief 
characteristics are the delicacies, the reserves, the 
mutual shyness, of the lovers. Love is never con- 
ceived by these southern poets as a bold flame, o'er- 
leaping bounds and sweeping everything before it. 
Finally, the King and Sakuntala come to an under- 
standing ; and in the absence of her guardian, the 
sage Kanva, they are married by the Gandharva rite. 
But the King has to return to his kingdom, and he 
departs leaving with Sakuntala a ring. Kanva 
arrives and approves the marriage; but, unfor- 
tunately, Sakuntala has incurred the wrath of an 
irascible hermit who curses her and declares that her 
husband shall forget her. He relents so far as to 
allow that upon the sight of the ring of recognition 
remembrance shall return to Dushyanta. The greatly 
admired fourth act shows the departure of Sakun- 
tala from the hermitage. It is indeed a most tender 
and touching picture of girlhood breaking the ties 
that bind it to the only home which it has known. 
It is the most universal thing in Kalidasa. Sakun- 
tala goes from tree to tree, from flower to flower, 
and bids them farewell ; and she showers pet names 
and caresses upon the fawn she has raised, and the 
girl comrades who have grown up with her. The 
scene changes to Dushyanta's palace. He is restless 
and melancholy, stricken with forgetfulness of the 
past, yet conscious that there has been a past. 
Sakuntala appears; but, unfortunately, she has

lost the ring of recognition, and the King refuses 
to receive her as his wife. She is carried off into 
the air. Then the ring is recovered by a fisherman 
who finds it in a fish he has caught. It is brought 
to the King, who recovers his memory and is plunged 
into grief. He is called away to lead the armies of 
Indra ; and finally, in the heaven of Kasyapa, he 
meets his son by Sakuntala, and is reconciled to 
his wife. There is not much strength or variety of 
characterization in the play. The hermits are fairly 
well discriminated, and there is one scene of low life 
between two constables and the fisherman which 
lends some relief to the poetry and phantasy of the 
work. 

" Vikrami and Urvasi," Kalidasa's other admitted 
play, is a slighter work than " Sakuntala," but, if 
anything, is even more ethereally beautiful. Again 
the piece opens magnificently. The scene is upon 
a peak of the Himalayas. A bevy of Apsarasaa, 
Sky-nymphs, are grouped there, when Kesin, one of 
the Demons, descends upon them and carries off 
Urvasi. Pururavas, an earthly king, enters, pur- 
sues the Demon, brings the nymph back, and falls 
in love with her. The scene changes to the garden 
of Pururavas. His friend, the buffoon of the piece, 
betrays to the Queen the secret of the King's love. 
Urvasi enters unseen. She writes a letter on a 
leaf to Pururavas, and listens to his love raptures. 
He loses the letter, and it falls into the hands of the 
Queen, who confronts him with it and refuses him 
forgiveness. Urvasi falls under a curse, and loses 
her divine knowledge. Then there is a beautiful 
evening scene in the garden, when the Queen relents 
and gives the King permission to possess the nymph. 
The great act, however, is again the fourth. The 
lovers have retired from the city into the mountains. 
Urvasi unknowingly profanes a tabooed grove, and 
is changed into a vine. Pururavas wanders every- 
where searching for her. As, in the former play, 
Sakuntala's farewell to the trees and flowers amid 
which she has grown up is the deepest note struck, 
so here Pururavas's appeal to all the animals in turn 
to aid him in finding Urvasi is the strongest part of 
the play. At last he finds a ruby of transformation 
which changes the nymph back into her own shape. 
In the remainder of the play other complications 
ensue which form almost a new action. 

There is not enough opposition or resistance in 
Kalidasa's plays to make the dramatic fibre tense 
and strong. There is no shadow — at most, only a 
white mist. As a consequence, the figures are not 
firm and definite ; they have not the body and 
movement of life. They are delicate, floating, 
atrial visions, infused with the sweetness and tender- 
ness of ideal sentiment. 

In Bhavabhuti, we descend unto the earth and 
move among human beings like ourselves. We de- 
scend further into gulfs and glooms that would have 
appalled Kalidasa's soul. " Malati and Madhava " 
has been called the eastern "■ Romeo and Juliet " — 
not so much from the characters of the lovers, who, 



like all Hindoo creations of that kind, are shy and 
timid in the extreme, given to the most roundabout 
declaration of their passion and to pining away on 
the slightest provocation, but because of some of the 
incidents which recall the English play. The plot 
relates the fortunes of two young persons in the 
ordinary rank of life whom Kamandaki, a seeress, 
schemes to join together. Malati is carried off by 
a priest and priestess of the dread goddess Durga, 
as a sacrifice. The scene of culminating horror is 
a field of dead bodies before the temple at Durga. 
Madhava enters with a drawn sword and a lump of 
human flesh, to propitiate the deity of the place. 
Within the temple, Malati, dressed as a sacrifice, is 
about to be offered up a victim by the priest and 
priestess. Madhava enters, rescues Malati, fights 
with the priest and kills him. The priestess flies off, 
screaming vengeance. In greatness of conception 
and gloomy power of execution, the scene is not 
unworthy of comparison with that of Juliet awak- 
ing in the tomb. The last act of the play is a fit 
companion of the one described. Malati has been 
carried off again, and Madhava and his friend 
wander in search of her amid the peaks and gulfs 
of the Vindhyan mountains. They are faint with 
hunger, and worn out with woe ; and after long 
utterances of hopeless grief, Madhava is about to 
jump into an abyss, when Kamandaki appears with 
the garland he had given Malati and the news that 
she is alive. There is a lively and natural sub-plot 
of another pair of lovers. The piece ends happily — 
as do all Hindoo plays. 

The " Latter Acts of Rama," Bhavabhuti's other 
play, is a sequel to the great Hindoo epic "The 
Ramayana." Sita, the lovely heroine of that poem, 
after the overthrow of Ravana, her abductor, goes 
through the ordeal of fire to satisfy her husband's 
subjects as to her chastity. But this is not enough ; 
and when they revolt again, Rama cold-bloodedly 
puts her from him and orders her to be exposed in 
the Dandaka forest. Twelve years later, filled with 
remorse, he visits the forests and there encounters 
his two sons whom Sita gave birth to in the early 
days of her exile. The situation and the characters 
of the two boys remind one of the sons of Cymbeline. 
The play is perhaps more remarkable for scenic 
splendor than for tragic depth. In the first act, 
Rama's brother exhibits to him a series of great 
wall-paintings depicting the main incidents of " The 
Ramayana." Lava, Rama's son, makes war upon his 
father's guax'ds in a scene which must have taken a 
great deal of staging to produce. And in the last 
act, Rama's family and subjects are assembled in a 
great amphitheatre on the banks of the Ganges, and 
Valmiki, the poet of the Ramayana exhibits a play 
representing the sufferings of the exposed Sita. The 
gods descend and declare her purity, and restore her 
to her husband. 

" Ratnavali, the Necklace," is a charmingly told 
story of court intrigue. The heroine is a young 
princess who is found on a piece of wreck at sea,

with a diamond necklace upon her. The ornament 
indicating high birth, she is placed by her preserver 
as an attendant upon the Queen Vasavadatta, who, 
unknown to either, is her cousin. Sagarika falls in 
love with the King, like Louise de la Valliere. Her 
affection is betrayed by a pet starling, who repeats 
to the King a conversation between Sagarika and a 
friend. The usual consequences follow. In the 
end, Sagarika's relationship and royal birth are dis- 
covered, and the Queen accepts her as her husband's 
second wife. A very startling and effective theatre 
spectacle occurs in the last act. The King and Queen 
with their attendants are assembled in the garden. A 
conjurer is present, and he makes it appear that the 
palace, where Sagarika is imprisoned, is in flames. 
The King rushes into the fire to rescue her. The 
conjurer reverses the spell, the palace stands as be- 
fore, and Sagarika and the King descend to meet 
the others. 

" Mudra-Rakshasa ; or. The Signet of the Minis- 
ter," is a political play without any love interest 
whatever. It relates the plots and counterplots of 
Chanakya, the Minister of Chandragupta, and Rak- 
shasa, the adviser of Malayaketu, — Chandragupta 
being the usurper and his rival the representative of 
the murdered race of Nanda, the legitimate King. 
The whole piece has for its purpose the reconcilia- 
tion of Rakshasa with the reigning monarch ; and 
this is brought about by the deep devices of Cha- 
nakya, who outwits his rival at every point, turns 
all his plots against himself, and gradually dissolves 
the partnership between Rakshasa and the prince 
whose cause he has espoused. There is little differ- 
ence in morality between the two diplomats, though 
as Rakshasa has followed with allegiance a fallen 
lord he may perhaps be deemed the nobler character. 
But Chanakya is by far the greater man, and there 
is hardly any figure in Shakespeare's political 
plays which makes a greater impression on one 
of intellectual power and subtlety. There is a re- 
markable scene which out-Machiavels Machiavel, 
where Chandragupta and his Minister publicly 
pretend to quarrel, and the latter is apparently 
disgraced, all in order to lull their enemies into 
security. 

On the whole, the Hindoo drama, scanty as it is 
(there are about sixty pieces in all) , is worthy of the 
profoundest admiration, not only because of its sin- 
gular prefiguration of the European romantic theatre, 
but because of its sheer literary power. " The Little 
Clay Cart " is Shakespearean throughout in its 
breadth and lifelikeness. Shakuntala may fairly be 
placed above any work of Shelley, above the " starry 
and flowery autos " of Calderon. And " Malati and 
Madhava " touches in certain scenes a height only 
attained by the greatest dramatists.

CASUAL COMMENT. 

The purchase of books by the pound is not 
a wise way to spend money. A twenty-volume 
"Library of the World's Wittiest After-Dinner 
Speeches " must be a fearful monster to live with. 
It tips the scales at (let us say) half a hundred- 
weight, and though you may not have actually bar- 
gained for it by the pound or the cubic foot, you 
might almost as well have done so, for all the literary 
worth it possesses. A recent Bulletin from the 
New York State Library, containing a classified 
list of 250 desirable books published in 1907, re- 
prints for the third or fourth time the following 
piece of wholesome advice, which originally appeared 
in the " Journal of New Jersey Libraries " for 
October, 1903 : " Finest Orations, Noblest Essays, 
Royal Flim Flams, Huge Anthologies, and the 
like, all come to the secondhand man. Get them of 
him, if you must. In a small library they are gen- 
erally almost useless. In subscription books, cases 
like this are not uncommon. Maspero wrote several 
large and learned volumes, in French, on Egypt and 
Chaldea. They were translated and published in 
three or four volumes in England, costing libraries 
in this country about $5 each. An American pub- 
lisher reprints them in 12 small volumes with a few 
additional colored cuts, on heavier paper and in 
larger type, and offers them through agents for 
$84 — and libraries buy them! Do not buy 'sets' 
or complete editions of authors. Buy the volumes 
you need and as you need them. A complete set 
always includes several volumes you do not need. 
Specify the edition you wish of standard books when 
you can, unless you find a bookseller able and will- 
ing to select them wisely for you." 
• • • 

Commercial methods in library adminis- 
tration are, naturally enough, extremely repulsive 
to many an able and enthusiastic librarian. Any- 
thing like business '* hustle " or loud-voiced self- 
advertising might well make an Edwards or a 
Panizzi or a Spofford turn in his grave. Yet for 
certain purposes — as for making mechanics and 
artisans aware of the benefit they, in their calling, 
can derive from the public library — some sort of 
advertising seems advisable. A librarian may well 
shrink from crying the virtues of his wares in poetry 
or philosophy or religion, but even a large-type 
public notice that the four volumes of Richardson on 
" Practical Blacksmithing " have been added to the 
library ought not to shock the sensitive. Once upon 
a time a certain painter (not a latter-day Raphael 
or Rembrandt, but just a humble artist in clapboard 
and wainscot decoration) entered a public library 
not a thousand miles from Springfield, Mass., and, 
being " out of a job," spent some time browsing 
among the books. To his joy and surprise, he dis- 
covered works bearing on his trade. Although he 
had been a card-holder for years, he had never before 
had a suspicion that such books were there on the 



1908.]

shelves, waiting to be drawn. The painter's glad 
astonishment gave a hint to the librarian : mimeo- 
graphed lists of available works on different trades 
and industries were circulated, the local newspapers 
were prevailed upon to give publicity to these and 
other resources of the library, and as a result the 
circulation of that library increased twenty-five per 
cent in one year. All of which goeth to show that 
a library that is set on a hill may, unfortunately, be 
hid — until it condescends to reveal itself.

Attainment of the quiet mind, the philosophic 
calm, the placid content, that makes beautiful, even 
in the eyes of restless youth, some hoary-headed 
grandparent, some scarred veteran of many wars, or 
some weather-beaten sea-captain, retired after count- 
less voyages, is a thing as difficult as it is desirable. 
The ocean life as a sedative received not long ago 
a few words of commendation that impress them- 
selves on the mind. In his sermon commemorative 
of the late Rev. A. J. Haynes, of New Haven, 
Professor Emery of Yale took occasion to say : " The 
men of the coast, furthermore, possess that strange 
serenity of temper which comes from wrestling with 
the sea. They learn early the lesson that impatience 
and fretf ulness are of no avail ; the sea brings the 
fog or drives it away regardless of man's purposes. 
And so they learn to face all the vicissitudes of life 
with a serene fortitude born of hard experience. In 
youth they have the longing for adventure, not from 
the fevered fretfulness of the city-bred, but obeying 
the far ancestral call of the seafaring blood. They 
carry with them the temper which makes them take 
strange lands calmly as their birthright, but which 
brings them back like homing birds." Was Tennyson 
quite true to nature in making his aged Ulysses, 
homeward come at last from his years of wandering 
and hardship, so impatient to " smite the sounding 
furrows " once more, and " to sail beyond the sun- 
set, and the baths of all the western stars," until 
death should overtake him ? A man of his reputed 
experience and wisdom would rather thank the gods 
for the rest and peace vouchsafed him at last, and, 
his mind teeming with varied memories, he would 
be glad to end his days in undisturbed rumination 
and in watching the billows beat against the crags 

of his native Ithaca.

The sevenpenny reprint, which is a respect- 
able and self-respecting cloth-bound book, and is not 
to be confused with the sixpenny paper-covered 
novel or magazine, has apparently proved a com- 
mercial and a literary success in Great Britain. In 
an interview (published in " The Book Monthly") 
with Mr. John Buchan, the London member of the 
Edinburgh house of Thomas Nelson & Son, he is 
reported as saying : " We are still asked, as often as 
ever, how it is done. We owe large thanks to the 
booksellers, some of whom, there can be no harm in 
saying, were a little opposed to the ' sevenpenny ' at 
the start. . . . Our returns for the first year showed 
■ales of two million copies, and it is worth pointing 



out that the gross profit earned by the book trade 
on this return would be about £20,000. To earn 
as much on six-shilling novels, some three hundred 
thousand of these would have to be sold, and they 
do n't sell like that. . . . Moreover, the ' seven- 
penny ' is stock which moves quickly : it is bought 
by customers who otherwise might leave a shop 
without buying at all, and it attracts new customers." 
Living authors whose books are, by permission, 
included in the sevenpenny reprints, are said to like 
the plan because it insures a large circulation, and 
that, too, among a class of purchasers not otherwise 
reached. If credit is due the man who makes two 
blades of grass grow where only one grew before, 
commendation should not be withheld from a fair 
and honorable scheme that causes six copies of a 
good book to be bought where only one found a 
purchaser before. , , , 

Our greatest public library's rapid expan- 
sion is impressively brought to notice in the pages 
of the " Fifty-Sixth Annual Report of the Trustees 
of the Public Library of the City of Boston." The 
maintenance of this great metropolitan system now 
involves the care and management of properties 
aggregating at least five million dollars in value. 
Besides the splendid Central Library in Copley 
Square, there are twenty-eight branches and reading- 
rooms, while books are also delivered regularly at 
forty-six engine houses, thirty-one " institutions " 
(as the librarian conveniently but indefinitely puts 
it), and one hundred and eight public and parochial 
schools. Thus an area exceeding forty-three square 
miles has local delivery of books and enjoys other 
library privileges. An item of considerable interest 
relates to the remission of fines incurred by children, 
after the lapse of six months, which went into effect 
last year and has set free for use thousands of cards 
on which fines were due. Beneficial results are 
thought to have followed in diminishing the irregu- 
lar taking of books from the open shelves. In the 
department of current fiction, this conservative and, 
as is well known, puritanically particular library has 
bought, in the twelve months reported on, 1,623 
novels (not counting fiction in foreign languages) ; 
and in replacements it has purchased 8,123 volumes 
of fiction. Its total book collection now amounts 
to 922,348. . . . 

Backwardness in book-learning is not always 
so disquieting a symptom in school-children as one 
might be led to infer from recent articles on the 
subject that have appeared in "The Psychological 
Clinic," a journal founded and edited by Professor 
Lightner Witmer, of the University of Pennsylvania. 
Certain studies of the extent of retardation in school 
work in five of our large cities seem to show that 
in New York and Philadelphia approximately forty 
per cent of the public-school pupils are less advanced 
than, for their age, they ought to be ; in Kansas 
City and Camden (N. J.) nearly fifty per cent are 
alleged to be backward. Boston proudly shows a 
delinquent percentage of only 12.5, and is believed 



244

to have a public school system worthy of study by 
other communities. But could one well conceive 
of any subject less adapted to the methods of exact 
scientific treatment than this? Indeed, the writers 
themselves pick flaws in each other's deductions and 
computations, and admit that their statistical struc- 
tures rest on a rather sandy foundation. But even 
if the situation is as bad as it is made out to be, let 
not the backward boy or girl of Kansas City alto- 
gether lose heart. The English inventor, Maxim, has 
lately told how, in his school days, he was awarded 
the leather medal for stupidity ; and yet he has 
pretty clearly demonstrated that he has a braia of 
his own and knows how to use it. 
• • • 

Two GREAT WOKKS OF LABORIOUS RESEARCH, 

and necessarily of limited sale, are announced for 
publication — sometime. One is a " Subject In- 
dex," to be prepared by the Royal Society of London, 
of all scientific papers published in the nineteenth 
century. Seventeen volumes will be required to 
contain this immense catalogue, one volume of which, 
indeed, has already appeared — that comprising 
" Pure Mathematics," in nearly 700 large closely 
printed pages. Things of beauty may not, indeed, 
flower very richly from so sterile a soil as an index 
of mathematical papers ; but there is more hope in 
the pages of a forthcoming " Encyclopaedia of Slavic 
Philology," in the Russian language, edited by 
Professor V. Jagic, and issued under the auspices 
of the Imperial Academy of Science, in St. Peters- 
burg. Five or six large volumes are expected to 
contain the various contributions of Slavic philolo- 
gists ; and one of these volumes, or a part of one, 
is already completed, giving a sketch of Russian 
literature from the seventeenth century to the nine- 
teenth, by Professor E. Budde, and designated as 
Part XII. of the entire work. The faith and zeal 
of those publishers and learned societies that dare 
to undertake such ponderous works are surely to be 
admired. ... 

The loss of an English scholar of rare crit- 
ical ability, an educator of varied and honorable 
achievement, a lecturer of power and of charm, as 
we have had opportunity to learn in this country, 
and a promoter in general of what is sound and 
wholesome in the world of letters, is that of Professor 
J. Churton Collins, who was found dead in the fens 
of East Anglia. "Well read and of pronounced 
opinions in his chosen department of English liter- 
ature, he did not confine his activities within its 
bounds. Among his later activities may be noted 
his establishment of a school of journalism for 
graduates in arts and science. So diligent was he 
in every work to which he put his hand that it is 
thought he undermined his health by excessive in- 
dustry. Rarely did he take more than six hours of 
sleep out of the twenty-four, and often less. Person- 
ally he was of gi*eat courtesy in his bearing, and he 
cannot fail to have left many friends to mourn his 
loss. 



A BRISK CIRCULATION OF PUBLIC-LIBRARY BOOKS 

is as desirable as a brisk circulation of blood in the 
body. The one no less than the other begets buoy- 
ancy and cheerfulness, and a certain sanguine con- 
viction that the lark and the snail are about their 
usual business and the world is all right, as Pippa 
parenthetically observes. The Public Library of 
San Francisco, tried by fire and shaken upsidedown 
by earthquake, is (to use a commercial phrase) 
doing a larger business on a smaller capital than 
any library we at present know of. Since last year 
its circulation has increased one-third. The librarian 
reports : " A circulation of 465,437 from a total 
(on June 30, 1908) of 54,317 volumes is the 
equivalent of loaning each book in the Library an 
average of over eight and a half times during the 
year ; but it should be borne in mind that a large 
number of the 54,317 volumes are reference works 
and do not circulate, so that the average is in reality 
much higher." He predicts still more creditable 
results as soon as the smitten library shall have more 
perfectly recovered from its recent disaster. 
... 

The " REAL ACTIVITIES " OF AN INSTITUTION OF 

LEARNING are not, as the unreflecting might hastily 
infer, intellectual : they are muscular. The occur- 
rence of an intercollegiate football game in the 
Stadium at Harvard, on the afternoon preceding the 
opening of the academic year, was an event of a 
nature that might have excited comment in an 
earlier age ; but now the cutting short of one's vaca- 
tion in order to return to college and undergo a 
week or ten days of preliminary training for a game 
that itself takes place before the term opens, is taken 
as a matter of course. In fact, one of the leading 
Boston newspapers, in its editorial mention of this 
first football game of the year at Cambridge, speaks 
of it as inaugurating "the season's real activities at 
the university." These physical activities, then — 
chiefly brachial and crural on the part of the eleven 
elect, pulmonary and bronchial on the part of their 
less "beefy" mates and admirers — are henceforth 
to be regarded as the " real activities " of a univer- 
sity. A revised and amended edition of Newman's 
" Office and Work of Universities " is now in order.

A Chinese editor of an American newspaper 
is little short of a phenomenon. What would have 
been impossible and incredible twenty years ago is 
now possible and actual. Mr. Vu Kyuin Willington 
Ku has been chosen editor-in-chief of "The Daily 
Spectator," which is conducted by the students of 
Columbia University. What is more, the paper has 
already responded to the new editor's touch, and has 
doubled its size and trebled its advertising. Mr. 
Ku is reported to be but twenty-two years old, to 
be a master of the English language, to know more 
about American politics than do most Americans, and 
to possess remarkable ability as a debater. Further- 
more, he is an athlete and one of the most popular 
men in the university. This is his senior year in 
the Law School, where he is studying our jurispru-

returning, upon graduation, to his own country,

While this brilliant young Chinaman might be called 
a yellow journalist, he does not appear to be in any 
way inclined to yellow journalism.

A NATIONAL ANTHEM TO ORDER is expected soon 
to be forthcoming. The National Institute of Arts 
and Letters offers prizes for the best productions 
designed to supersede " America " and " The Star- 
Spangled Banner." It is true that one of our present 
popular anthems is sung to the tune of *' God Save 
the King," while the other is set to music that is 
almost unsingable ; but such as they are, these songs 
are dear to many American hearts and may very 
possibly show a stubborn disinclination to be ousted. 
National anthems, too, are something like poets, in 
not being made by taking thought. Mrs. Howe 
wrote her " Battle-Hymn of the Republic," not in 
cold blood, but in a moment of sudden inspiration. 
"The Watch on the Rhine " and " The Marseillaise " 
were not begotten of prize-offers from any institute 
of art and letters. However, we await results with 
interest and not wholly without hope. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



A TIMELY EUPHEMISM. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

It will, perhaps, not be thought strange if some of 
the readers of your characteristically sane and cautious 
journal experience an amused surprise at finding the 
reviewer of Mr. Herrick's novel " Together " saying that 
the work " lacks the virtue of reticence." Although 
I should hardly plead guilty to belonging to " the out- 
raged hosts of hypocrisy " to whom the reviewer refers, 
I will confess to finding " Together " dull, and devoid 
of the plot construction that I want in a novel, quite 
irrespective of its " strength " — an artistic quality that 
Mr. Herrick evidenced full possession of in " The 
Common Lot." 

But these are matters of taste and opinion; and so, 
I suppose, is the exercise of " the virtue of reticence " in 
a novel dealing with problems of sex relationship. But 
I wonder how many of your readers will like to join me 
in my congratulations upon the addition of a new 
euphemism to the critic's vocabulary, — and one likely 
to prove very useful, with the present trend of current 
fiction. John Grant. 

Burlington, Iowa, October 7, 190S. 

A QUESTION OF FIRST TRANSLATIONS. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
I enclose a clippmg from the advertising pages of 
the current Dial (I always read the advertisements!) 
and take the liberty of calling attention to what seems 
to me an error in the advertisement of Messrs. Duffield 
& Co., who announce an edition of "The Tumbler of 
Our Lady, and Other Miracles " as " now first translated 
from the Middle French MSS." I had a copy of this 
work in November, 1899, published in the Bibelot series 
by Mr. Mosher, who says of it: "It was first done 



into English in 1894, by the Rev. Philip H. Wicksteed, 
whose translation we reprint entire." A footnote adds: 

" Our Lady's Tumblor. A Twelfth Century Legend, 
Transcribed for Lady Day. M.D.C.CCXCIV. (by P. H. 
Wicksteed). Sq. IG^io- with Frontispiece and 2 illustrations 
by H. Granville Fell. (London 1894.). Another and later 
version (Boston, 1898) apparently owes its inception to the 
fact that the Wicksteed edition had gone out of print." 

Moreover, the story has been told by a modern 
French writer in his own fashion — giving no credit to 
the anonymous twelfth century writer. I think this 
was Anatole France, but at this moment cannot verify 
the impression. 

It is easy to believe that the publishers, as well aa 
the new translator, may not have known of the earlier 
translation. But it seems desirable that the work should 
not continue to be announced as the first English version.

TWO CASUAL QUERIES. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

I like your " Casual Comments." They have the 
charm that belongs to casual things, and part of that 
charm is to be suggestive — at times even tantalizing. 
Therefore, would you miud divulging which two lines 
of " The Rainy Day " could reasonably be printed with 
seven words wrong out of fifteen ? Upon investigation 
I find that there are three sets of lines that contain the 
requisite number of words ; so there is no way of being 
certain which of them the correspondent of the London 
" Nation " garbled so amazingly. 

In his article on Richard Wilson, Mr. Edward E. 
Hale, Jr., employs an expression about whose origin I 
have often wondered. I mean " petering-out." So I 
seize the opportunity to inquire about it, of you or any 
of your etymologically inclined readers. 

Margaret Vance. 

Oak Park, III, October 4, 1908. 

[The first stanza of "The Rainy Day" is as 
follows : 

" The day is cold, and dark, and dreary ; 

It rains, and the wind is never weary ; 

The vine still clings to the mouldering wall, 

But at every gust the dead leaves fall, 

And the day is dark and dreary." 

As printed in the London journal, the dead leaves 
fall from moss instead of vine, in the third line ; and 
the fourth and fifth lines are transformed thus : 

" And with every gust some dead leaves fall : 
Some days must be dark and dreary." 

A comparison will show that seven out of these 
fifteen words do not correspond with the original. 

We find " petering-out " {to peter out — to exhaust, 
to run out) in many of the dictionaries, but with 
very little light upon its origin. It is generally 
stated to be " a mining colloquialism." Curiously 
enough, the earliest use of it we have found cited is 
by Abraham Lincoln, who said of the store in which 
he was a partner, in New Salem, 111., in 1832, that 
it was " petering out." In Bowles's " Across the 
Continent" (1865) the Humboldt River is said to 
be " petering out." We shall be glad to hear from 
some of our etymological readers in the matter. —

Memories of the American Stage.* 

Whatever pronouncement Mr. William Win- 
ter, dean of American dramatic critics, may 
make concerning the stage will be sure to com- 
mand the attention of all who are devoted to 
the theatre, and especially of those who have its 
highest interests at heart. Mr. Winter speaks 
with the authority of an expert, with the judg- 
ment acquired by long experience, with the 
knowledge and sympathy which spring from 
personal acquaintance and association, and with 
the critical acumen and graceful style of the 
scholar. 

" Other Days, being Chronicles and Memories 
of the Stage " is Mr. Winters latest contribution 
to the history of the drama, which his publishers 
have issued in a handsome and finely illustrated 
volume of nearly four hundred pages. Its 
contents include, first, " a royal line "; and the 
royal line includes outline sketches of John 
Hodgkinson, James Fennell, Thomas Cooper, 
Edwin Forrest, Junius Brutus Booth, Joseph 
Jefferson, Edwin Booth, and Henry Irving. 
The careers of these eight actors, sketched 
currente calamo, form the background against 
which he has most charmingly delineated in de- 
tail the dramatic portraits of Joseph Jefferson, 
John Brougham, Dion Boucicault, Charlotte 
Cushman, Edward A. Sothern, John McCul- 
lough, Lawrence Barrett, Mary Anderson, and 
Adelaide Neilson — the nine artists who, we may 
infer, stand highest in his estimation. Richard 
Mansfield is not included in the list, but Mr. 
Winter explains the omission by the fact that he 
has been engaged for several years, with that 
artist's sanction, upon a work entitled " Life and 
Art of Richard Mansfield," to be published pres- 
ently. Several pages of interesting notes and an 
elaborate and accurate index close the volume. 

It is clear that Mr. Winter, while recognizing 
Forrest's talent, is not an ardent admirer of 
his style, though he admits, in one connection: 
" There are times when it is a comfort to see 
somebody who can let himself out. Forrest 
could." Mr. Winter further says of him : 

" Forrest was an uncommonly massive and puissant 
animal, and all his impersonations were more physical 
than intellectual, while no one of them possessed any 
spiritual element whatever. ... In threatening situa- 
tions of peril, suspense, or conflict, requiring the oppo- 
sition of granite solidity, physical power, vehement

tumult, and overwhelming vociferation, he was tre' 
mendously effective, . . . From the first, and until the 
last, his acting was saturated with < realism,' and that 
was one reason of his extensive popularity. He could 
at all times be seen, heard, and understood. He struck 
with a sledge-hammer. Not even nerves of gutta- 
percha eonld remain unshaken by his blow. In the 
manifestation of terror he lolled out his tongue, con- 
torted his visage, made his frame quiver, and used the 
trick-sword with the rattling hilt. In scenes of fury 
he panted, snorted, and snarled, like a wild beast. In 
death scenes his gasps and gurgles were protracted and 
painfully literal." 

Mr. Winter remarks that Forrest was " a 
good hater." " He publicly whipped the poet, 
N. P. Willis ; he would not allow John Gilbert, 
that noble and excellent man, to play in any 
company with which he was acting ; he disliked 
Edwin Booth ; he detested Charlotte Cushman." 
In this connection, I may be pardoned for citing 
a case in point from my own experience. I had 
criticised Forrest in his palmy days, much to 
his satisfaction. But during his last season at 
McVicker's Theatre, in Chicago, he had lost 
much of his power, his resonant voice had weak- 
ened, and he was afflicted with gout. In a 
review of his acting I incautiously intimated 
that the " veteran lagged superfluous." Forrest, 
boiling over with rage, asked Mr. McVicker who 

wrote " that criticism " of him. Upon 

being informed as to the authorship, Forrest 

said : " You go and tell that critic that 

Edwin Forrest will live to eat the goose that 
eats the grass that grows on his grave. If it 

were not for my gout I would go and tell 

him myself." Alas ! poor Forrest has been in his 
grave these many years, and the goose that was 
to graze on his critic's grave is still immune. 

Of Edwin Booth's personation of Richelieu, 
Mr. Winter says : 

" No impersonation has been seen, with more in it of 
heart, and exquisite finish. The art of it was like an 
embroidered cloth of gold. Every detail of that mem- 
orable embodiment, nevertheless, had been planned with 
scrupulous care and executed with formal fidelity to a 
settled design. ' I am conscious,' Booth once said to me, 
'of an interior personality standing back of my own, 
watching and guiding me.' It was his clear intellect. In 
every important part that he played he revealed a great 
nature ; and the memory of his genius, his beautiful 
character, and his beneficent life can never pass away." 

Mr. Winter dwells long and lovingly upon 
Joseph Jefferson and his exquisite art. 

" The magical charm of his acting was the deep human 
sympathy and the loveliness of individuality by which 
it was irradiated, — an exquisite blending of humor, 
pathos, grace, and beauty, that made it an intimate and 
confidential impartment to each and every mind and 
heart in all the vast auditory that he addressed. He 
often made me think of Emerson's expressive line: 
' Surely he carries a talisman under his tongue.' **

The analysis of Jefferson the man is a remark- 
able one. 

« He was more a man of imagination and feeling than 
of cold intellect and exact thought. He was full of 
caprices; mercurial and fanciful; a creature of moods; 
exceedingly, almost morbidly, sensitive ; eagerly desirous 
to please, because he loved to see people happy ; willing, 
if necessary, to displease everybody rather than win favor 
by unworthy means or by the violation of a principle 
of art; quick to fancy that he had been misimderstood ; 
very affectionate; keenly sensible of the misfortunes 
and sufferings of the lame, the blind, the deaf and the 
wretched; inordinately fond of approbation, and, at the 
same time, aware of the shallow mentality and hypo- 
critical insincerity of many of the persons who make up 
the social world; appreciative of the beauties of physical 
Nature, passionately fond of them, and skilful in paint- 
ing them; as much a lover of sports as though he were 
a boy ; worldly-wise, and yet absolutely simple ; sagacious 
in practical affairs, but credulous about everything 
preternatural or improbable; an instinctively correct 
and (when left to himself) an unerring judge of char- 
acter, but apt to be influenced by the nearest person 
who chanced to have possession of his confidence; 
innately modest and humble, but aware of the excep- 
tional merit of his artistic faculties and of their value ; 
serious, almost solemn at heart, but, superficially, vola- 
tile, mirthful, and good-naturedly satirical; tender in 
feeling, but quick to see the comic side of everything, — 
even of things the most serious." 

Of John Brougham's personation of Captain 
Maguire, in the " Serious Family," Mr. Winter 
says: 

" It was not only his fervent, sparkling, natural per- 
formance that attracted me, it was the personality of 
the actor, — that subtle quality, potential either to 
charm or to repel, which, in a long experience of the 
stage, I have found to be of vital and decisive import- 
ance. He had dash, buoyancy, joyous freedom, a 
combination of graces and allurements making the 
gallant manliness that always wins the heart of youth. 
That charm he never lost. Time made him, personally, 
sedate, but his acting never ceased to be blithe and 
happy. Mirth was as natural to him as music to the 
rippling brook or color to the rose." 

In connection with the account of Brougham's 
funeral, Mr. Winter recalls the following serio- 
comic incident : 

"Edwin Booth and I assisted to bear his pall. I 
remember that the two grave diggers, after they had 
lowered his coffin a little way into the grave, were con- 
strained, with many muttered exclamations of ' Aise 
her ! ' and ' Raise her ! ' to lift it up again, in order 
to enlarge the cavity. Booth and I, like Hamlet and 
Horatio, were standing under a neighboring tree, ob- 
serving those proceedings, and nothing was ever more 
wofuUy comic or more humorously rueful than Hamlet'' s 
smile, as he looked at me, with those deep, melancholy 
eyes, and with that little, furtive grimace, murmuring, 
as he did so, ' It is the last recall.' " 

In his sketch of Boucicault, Mr. Winter 
dwells more upon his ability as a playwriter 
than upon his performance as an actor. He 
closes the sketch with a serious comment. 



"His youth was precocious, adventurous, luxurious; 
his manhood was fortunate, self-indulgent, arrogant; 
his age was lonely and miserable; and, as a whole, his 
life, — notwithstanding its flurries of wealth and popu- 
larity, — was unhappy. The retrospection of it affords 
a melancholy spectacle: for, what does it signify that 
a man has written a clever book, or made a brilliant 
speech, or pleased an audience with a fine dramatic 
performance, if, when the sod has closed over his ashes, 
nobody thinks of him with a sigh or cares to place a 
flower on his grave!" 

It is easy to see that Charlotte Cushman was 
Mr. Winter's ideal of artistic superiority. He 
closes his sketch of her with this fine tribute : 

" Within the last thirty years several female actors 
have been distinguished in tragedy on the American 
stage, many beautiful women have appeared, and dis- 
plays have been made of genius and ability in various 
lines of dramatic art; but of opulent power in acting, 
such as was manifested, at certain supreme moments, in 
the Othello of Forrest, the Lear of Booth, the Virginius 
of McCullough, the Cassius of Barrett, and the Lady 
Macbeth of Charlotte Cushman, the audience of the 
present day has seldom seen a suggestive example. 
The contemporary American stage is fortunate, as to 
actresses, in the romantic loveliness of Miss Julia Mar- 
lowe, the intellectual force and striking originality of 
Mrs. Fiske, the gentle beauty and profound devotion of 
Miss Viola Allen, the abundant passion and exquisite vo- 
calism of Mrs. Carter, and the wild, dashing, picturesque 
abandonment of Miss Blanche Bates ; but no woman 
in the theatre of this period shows the inspirational fire, 
the opulent intellect, the dominant character and the 
abounding genius, — rising to great heights and satisfy- 
ing the utmost demand of great occasions, — that were 
victorious and imperial in Charlotte Cushman." 

Sothern's Lord Dundreary, says Mr. Winter, 
" as a work of dramatic art, viewed with refer- 
ence to its elaborate complex mosaic of detail, 
ranks with the most felicitous and memorable 
of recorded specialties." A pitiful picture is 
drawn of McCullough's last days ; and of his 
failings he speaks with gentle charity, while com- 
mending his fine talent. That he has no sym- 
pathy with fads is evidenced by the following : 

" The fads have their little day ; but, sooner or later, 
the world comes back to the right standard — to beauty, 
purity, simplicity, truth. In McCullough's day there 
was no thought of devoting the theatre to the exposition 
of physical disease or to the analysis of morbid emotion 
and degenerate physical propensities. His breezy laugh 
would have blown the Ibsen bubble from the stage. He 
would have set the heel of amused contempt on all such 
sickly humbugs as Maeterlinck, Sudermann, and Shaw." 

Of Lawrence Barrett, Mr. Winter speaks in 
a serious strain. " He was a vital incarnation 
of tremendous force, and he was prematurely 
destroyed by the tempest that surged in his soul." 

That Mr. Winter greatly admired Mary And- 
erson's personality is shown by the following: 

" Fair ; tall ; of an imperial figure ; her features reg- 
ular; her changeful blue eyes, placid as a smnmer

lake or blazing with the lire of roused imagination ; her 
noble head, enwreathed with its copious wealth of golden 
hair; her smile, the diamond sparkle of morning light; 
her gestures, large, wide, graceful, free ; her movement, 
at times electrical with action, at times pathetically 
eloquent of slow, wandering grief or the stupor of des- 
pair; her voice, clear, smooth, silvery, ranging through 
many moods, from the ripple of arch, bewitching mirth 
to the low moan of anguish, the deep whisper of passion or 
the clarion note of power — she filled the scene with her 
presence, and she filled the hearts of her audience with 
a refreshing sense of delightful, ennobling conviction 
of the possible loveliness and majesty of the human soul." 

One of Mr. Winter's most cherished mem- 
ories is of a visit to Paddington Churchyard in 
London with Mary Anderson, which he thus 
eloquently describes : 

" It was a Sunday, and the neighboring streets were 
deserted and still. The sky, overcast with mist-like 
clouds, was gray and dim. The leaves were falling, the 
twilight was coming slowly and a faint breeze was idly 
stirring the thin, withering grass. No sound was heard 
save of rustling foliage and sighing wind. I was stand- 
ing at the grave of Sarah Siddons, illustrious actress of 
the Past; and beside me, pensive and mute, looking 
down upon the mould, stood Mary Anderson, auspicious 
actress of the Present. There, on the one side, a few 
words, cut in marble, to record the end of a glorious 
life: the garlands dead; the music hushed; the pageant 
vanished. Here, on the other side, beauty in its radi- 
ance; youth in its triumph; genius in its power; fame in 
its glory. The contrast and the monition were too deep 
for words. We laid a few flowers on that grave and 
turned away in silence." 

The last portrait in Mr. Winter's gallery is 
that of the beautiful Adelaide Nielson. He 
recognizes her beauty and personal charm, and 
likewise her limitations. 

" She wished to be, and she was determined to be, 
the leading actress of the English stage in the plays of 
Shakespeare. That purpose she avowed in my presence, 
and she declared that no consideration should be per- 
mitted to thwart or impede the accomplishment of that 
design. Observation, in general, considered her char- 
acter to be weak: at one time she was designated 'a 
photograph actress.' No greater mistake could have 
been made. Her character was, in some respects, 
exceptionally strong. The defect in her organization, 
and the consequent frailty of her plan, was that she 
possessed the wild imagination, the ' fine frenzy ' of 
genius, without, in herself and for herself, its crowning 
power of perfect intellectual control." 

In the closing pages of Mr. Winter's book 
he contrasts stage conditions of the present with 
those of the past, and finds them " unsatisfactory 
to persons who possess judgment, knowledge, 
and taste." He uses a caustic pen in dealing 
with the subject, as will be seen by these few 
extracts : 

" The theatrical audience of this period is largely 
composed of vulgarians who know nothing about art or 
literature and who care for nothing but the solace of 
their common tastes and animal appetites." 

" The theatre has fallen into the clutches of sordid, 



money-grubbing tradesmen, who have degraded it into 
a bizarre." 

" The theatrical audience is either inconsiderate of the 
actor or contemptuous of him — for, as a rule, its sole 
quest is amusement, and its primary thought is of itself 
and not of those who ministe:^ to its mental welfare." 

" In our time the direction of the stage is commonly 
assumed, not by old, competent, experienced actors, but 
by some popinjay who calls himself ' a producer,' and 
whose whole stock in trade consists of an owlish assump- 
tion of wisdom, a mischievous celerity in interposing 
frivolous objections, and an exasperating demeanor of 
peacock authority." 

"The stage has fallen on evil days. . . . No indi- 
cations are now visible that a change for the better is 
near at hand. Every denotement, on the contrary, is 
indicative of the decline of romance, and the growth of 
vulgarity and greed." 

This constitutes a sharp arraignment of the 
stage and stage management of to-day. There 
will be some who will condemn Mr. Winter; 
many will disagree with him, but others will 
applaud his courageous defense of the highest 
mission of the theatre, and will rejoice that now, 
as always, his pen has been devoted to the fur- 
therance of that mission. They will remember 
that he has always set a high standard, and has 
never allowed himself to be diverted from what 
he believes to be the truth by personal assault 
of his motives, by ridicule of his high purpose, 
or by managerial flattery or the sordid influences 
of commercialism. Whether we accept or deny 
his position there is food for serious thought in 
his closing chapter, for as Mr. Winter says : 

" The dramatic blessings of the age are not nmnerous, 
and, with a view to their instruction and the improve- 
ment of the time in which they live, its worshippers 
might advantageously inquire whether such conditions 
as now prevail would have been possible when the 
theatre, instead of being, as it now is, under the control 
of a sordid, crafty monopoly, was dominated by such 
figures as Edwin Forrest, Edwin Booth, John Gilbert, 
James E. Murdoch, Lawrence Barrett, John McCul- 
lough, Lester Wallack, Thomas Barry, Augustin Daly, 
E. L. Davenport, John E. Owens, William Warren, 
Edwin Adams, William Florence, and Joseph Jefferson. 
Let us be just to the Present, but not unjust to the Past."

The Origin and Development of 
Secret Societies.* 



No subject in primitive culture has aroused 
more curiosity and discussion than initiation 
rites and secret societies. In the book on 
" Primitive Secret Societies," just brought out 
by Dr. Hutton Webster, a careful accumulation 
of data upon the subject is presented. In their 
beginning, such rites and societies are related

York : The Macmillan Co.

THE DIAL. 



249 



to sex-ideas ; and the first chapters of the book 
discuss this phase of the matter. The separa- 
tion of the sexes is fundamental in primitive 
society. In Australia, New Guinea, and Me- 
lanesia, Malaysia (and to a notable degree in 
the Philippines), Hindostan, Farther India, 
Micronesia, Polynesia, Africa, and to some 
extent in the Americas, we find the primitive 
institution of the " men's house." While it 
presents various forms of expression, it is every- 
where the abode of the unmarried men and " a 
centre of the civil, religious, and social life of 
the tribe." Also widely distributed are prac- 
tices of a ceremonial initiatory character. While 
several transitions from one age or period to 
another are marked by such practices, the init- 
iatory rites of puberty are particularly common. 
Such puberty ceremonials have been described, 
especially among Australian, African, and 
Melanesian populations. They are usually 
obligatory upon all males, and until the youth 
has undergone them he is not recognized as a 
man or an active member of his tribe. Such 
rites generally include some test of endurance 
or bravery, and the fact that they have been per- 
formed is evidenced by some mutilation or phy- 
sical mark — as circumcision, tooth-extraction, 
or gashing. The rite is often symbolical, and 
involves the apparent death and resurrection of 
the initiate, the adoption of a new name, the 
sundering of old ties and relationships and the 
formation of new ones, and the acquisition and 
use of a new, or not generally understood, jargon 
or language. During the period of the ceremony 
the youths live apart and are instructed by 
older men in the mysteries, the rights, the 
duties and obligations of tribal membership. 
Thus, " Australian lads learn the marriage 
laws, the tribal customs and traditions, the 
native games, songs, and dances, and the pre- 
vailing moral code of the community " at this 
period of seclusion. The ceremonies are an 
effective system of social control ; they are the 
means through which the elders rule and gain 
advantages for themselves. They are often 
marked by deceit and trickery, and magic and 
mystery are employed to enhance their power 
and effect ; on the whole, however, their result 
is good. 

" The initiation ceremonies which have been up to 
this point the subject of study, present several clearly 
marked characteristics. Above all, they are tribal : 
every male member of the community must, at some 
time or other, have passed through them. They are 
secret, and jealously guarded from the eyes of the unin- 
itiated. They are commimal rites, and the occasion of 
great festive celebrations which call out every member 



of the tribe and absorb his energies over a protracted 
period. They are organized and conducted by the 
elders, who are the responsible guardians of the state. 
They have a definite and reasonable purpose : the young 
men growing into manhood must learn their duties aa 
members of the community; they must be schooled in 
the traditions and moral regulations developed through 
long periods of tribal experience. On the transmission 
and perpetuation of this experience, the life of the com- 
munity depends. In a state of society destitute of 
centralized political control, such puberty rites constitute 
the most effective means of providing that subordination 
of the interests of the individual to the welfare of the 
whole, without which social progress cannot be long 
maintained. The initiatory institutions found among 
the most primitive peoples in every quarter of the globe 
answer to the most definite and imperative of social 
requirements." 

With development in the form of social 
organization, the need of these initiation cere- 
monies becomes less. As the chieftainship 
becomes more sharply defined, there grows up 
what Dr. Webster calls the tribal secret society. 
These are aristocratic fraternities of limited and 
selected membership, the function of which is 
the performance of religious and magical rites 
for the benefit of the tribe. Such secret societies 
are not an invariable development, but where 
they occur they grow out of the old initiation 
ceremonies, and are marked by many of their 
practices. They too serve as a mode of control, 
the political, judicial, and economic value of 
which is great. Such societies are common 
and are remarkably developed among American 
Indian tribes and many African peoples. They 
are usually characterized by limited membership, 
" degrees," " lodges," and " elaborate parapher- 
nalia of mystery." The old effort of the elder 
men to hold the power in their own hands is 
here maintained, as only the older members can 
reach the higher degrees. While the value and 
function of such tribal secret societies has already 
been somewhat suggested, their operations are 
varied and deserve specific statement. They pro- 
vide an inter-tribal bond ; they act to strengthen 
or reinforce the rising power of the chief, — it 
is the man who is mounting to political power 
who succeeds in gaining the higher degrees, and 
behind him as a reliable supporting force are 
those who participate with him in the secret rites 
of his lodge ; they confer upon their member- 
ship privileges which place them above and out- 
side of many of the tabus and prohibitions 
holding upon the uninitiated. The tribal secret 
societies thus become definite and powerful sys- 
tems of control. This is clearly shown in such 
organizations as the duk-duk of Melanesia and 
the purr ah of Sierra Leone. One function, so 
marked and definite that some writers have con- 



250 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 16, 



sidered it the sole purpose of these organizations, 
is the keeping of women in subjection. 

Notwithstanding its value and power, the 
tribal secret society tends to disappear with 
advancing social progress. As communities 
increase in importance, and social intercourse 
grows, the mystery upon which the society 
depends disappears. One symptom of this de- 
cline is the admission of women to membership. 
Contact with new and notably different social 
conditions works toward their disintegration 
and destruction ; the trader and the missionary 
alike aid in their downfall. We often find the 
weakened tribal secret society the stronghold of 
conservatism and of opposition to foreign influ- 
ence. It usually disappears in one of two suc- 
cessors — the social club or the magical fraternity. 
To the latter, which is far the more important, 
are related totemic clan ideas. Webster's con- 
cluding argument is devoted to a consideration 
of the development of the magical fraternity of 
priests and shamans charged with the perfor- 
mance of magical and dramatic rites, and its 
relation to the primitive totemic groups. 

This summary of Dr. Webster's discussion is 
condensed from his own outline, and adequately 
conveys an idea of his treatment of this import- 
ant and interesting subject. The value of his 
work is apparent, and his book is the most satis- 
factory presentation of its subject so far made 
in English. It is the most important American 
contribution to anthropological theory that has 
appeared for a long time. Not that we agree 
with each and every claim, but the argument is 
well presented and the treatment will serve as 
the basis for any further consideration. 

Two minor points of taste and usage may be 
raised. Why does Dr. Webster use the form 
Basutos ? He does so more than once — as 
" Basutos boys." Basuto is a noun and an 
adjective. There is a tendency to use many 
tribal names as invariable, in respect of num- 
ber, — as Eskimo, Botocudo, Ainu, etc. In 
some cases this usage is perhaps based upon the 
fact that the original name (as used by the tribe 
itself or its neighbors) is invariable. Whether 
this be the fact or not, in any given case, the 
tendency exists among anthropological writers, 
and seems good. So far as the word Basuto is 
concerned, it is already plural — meaning the 
Suto tribe or people. As a noun, then, Basutos 
is bad. Our author's use of it is adjectival; 
and it is rather late in English to make an 
adjective agree in form with a plural novm. 
Had this use of the word Basutos occurred but 
once in Professor Webster's book we should not 



mention it. It occurs more than once, and hence 
seems to represent some rule of procedure. 

Again, Dr. Webster pursues what we con- 
sider a deplorable practice in the matter of 
quotation. So far as concerns writers in English, 
he generally does not make exact quotation, 
preferring to re-state, in his own words, their 
facts or conclusions. We hail his method and 
commend his practice. We are only too glad to 
break away from the style of most of our gov- 
ernmental reports, where pages upon pages 
present to us, not the author's own thought, 
observation, digest, or argument, but a series 
of long quotations, frequently of no value, which 
merely show the compiler's lack of original 
thought and labor and his desire to produce a 
bulky volume by padding. Professor Webster, 
we have said, avoids this ; and we thank him for 
it. But he does quote passages from foreign 
writers, and these are in the original languages. 
Thus, we have quotations in Haddon's English 
as she is pigeoned in Melanesia — which ought 
never to have been printed thus by Haddon him- 
self — in French, in German, and in Italian. 
These quotations mar Dr. Webster's work. We 
hardly believe that he could not translate and 
re-state these as exactly as he re-states his 
English references. It may be that all who 
will read the book can translate these passages 
for themselves ; but we hope not. The book is 
too good a book to be read by so small a group 
of readers. It is published by a regular publish- 
ing house that seeks trade, at a price warranting 
a good sale to libraries and individuals. In 
such a book, these quotations smack of pedantry.

The Story of a Poet's IjIfe.* 

It was fitting that so fine a literary craftsman 
as Thomas Bailey Aldrich should find his biog- 
rapher in an almost equally painstaking and 
finished artist in letters, Mr. Ferris Greenslet. 
The " Life," awaited with something of eager- 
ness and impatience, fulfils expectation : it fit- 
tingly and delicately portrays the man and author 
who was taken from us a year and a half ago, 
one of the last survivors of New England's 
Augustan age. Its excellence is one of exclu- 
sion no less than of inclusion : in the compass 
of three hundred uncrowded pages the story is 
told — or largely made to tell itself from letters 
— with a minimum of comment and criticism.

No selection from the correspondence could have 
been more discreet : personal names are fre- 
quently supplied by dashes, and nothing that 
could have vexed the soul of the writer has been 
given to the public. As Aldrich himself once 
said, after reading the Browning letters, "a 
man — even the greatest — cannot stand being 
photographed in his pajahmas "; and he thanks 
heaven that we are spared Shakespeare's letters 
to Anne Hathaway. 

Mr. Greenslet takes early occasion to explain 
that the theme of his book " is not the develop- 
ment of a literary faculty ; it is the story of a 
man's life." A closing chapter of twenty pages 
is given to " Aldrich's Poetry "; the rest of the 
book is briskly and entertainingly narrative, 
with that literary allusiveness, that concernment 
with the things of the poet's and novelist's and 
editor's world, that one looks for first of all in 
such a biography. The early training of the 
curly-haired, bright-faced youth who was born 
in Portsmouth almost seventy-two years ago was 
not what one might have prescribed for a future 
poet. Disappointed in his hope of a college 
education, his father having died suddenly when 
the son was but thirteen years old, that son — 
the only child, as it chanced, of his widowed 
mother — entered at sixteen the counting-room 
of his uncle's commission-house in Pearl Street, 
New York. But, as the author says, — 
" The years from 1852 to 1855, that Aldrich spent as 
a clerk . . . seem to have left very little impress on 
his mind. Possibly some of his careful habits may have 
been formed there, and something of his shrewdness 
and capacity in business matters, a capacity not very 
prevalent among poets, may have sprung from this early 
training; but from the first he occupied himself more 
with lyrics than with ledgers. And his uncle used humor- 
ously to complain that he would always be found study- 
ing Spanish or doing something else equally remote from 
the commission business. His real life was lived in the 
little back-hall bedroom on the third floor of the house 
in Clinton Place, where amid his books, his pipes, his 
Japanese fans, of which he was an early collector, he saw 
" ' Such sights as youthfnl poets dream 
On summer eves by haunted stream ' ; 
and wrote, as he recalled late in his life, « a lyric or two 
every day before going downtown.' " 

It was this same uncle, of the Pearl Street 
counting-house, who said to his nephew, when 
the young man had announced that the editor of 
" Harper's " had accepted a poem of his and paid 
him fifteen dollars for it, — " Why don't you 

send the d d fool one every day ? " 

It is in the generous selections from Aldrich's 
correspondence that the chief interest of the 
book lies — by the wise intention of the self- 
suppressing biographer. And how good the 
correspondence is ! One does not have to add 



the contradictory adjective used by Aldrich him- 
self in writing of Lowell's letters. " How good 
and how poor they are ! " he exclaims. " Nearly 
all of them are too self-conscious. Emerson and 
Whittier are about the only men in that famous 
group who were not thinking about themselves 
the whole while. They were too simple to pose 
or to be intentionally brilliant." Very little of 
premeditation is there in the brilliancy of the 
letters sent forth from Mt. Vernon Street, from 
Ponkapog, or from the other places of residence 
or sojourn in the writer's somewhat widely- 
roaming life. His flashes seem as unexpected 
to himself as to his readers. Writing to Mr. 
Ho wells in 1876, he speaks of " The Queen of 
Sheba," then just begun, and closes with a 
whimsical reference to birthdays. 

" Here is a grand chance for something at once humor- 
ous and tragic. I feel at my poor best in the story, and 
in respect to style and characterization, I intend to leave 
my other prose tales behind — in their proper places ! 

" I have n't the heart to congratulate you on your 
birthday. I used to Qoddle mine, playing with it, as an 
infant plays with a powder-horn. A birthday is likely 
to go off any time, and leave a fellow dead, or at least 
mutilated for life." 

Opinions of contemporary authors, expressed 
in no uncertain terms, are scattered through the 
letters. For example, Aldrich says of one of 
these coevals : " Henry James has a plump and 
rosy prose style, and lots of observation. I envy 
him the easy grace with which he slips his pen 
through forty or fifty miles of aristocratic land- 
scape." And further, in regard to the same 
writer : 

" I think that characters in a novel should develop 
themselves by what they say and what they do — as in 
the drama. It appears to me a mistake to devote one 
or two hundred pages to the analysis of characters which 
accomplishes nothing. The persons in James's book 
affect me like a lot of admirably ' made up ' actors in 
the green-room waiting for their cue. Au reste, I 
greatly admire Henry James. He is an essayist of the 
very finest type; but he is not a natural story-teller." 

Walt Whitman he rated not high among 
poets. " The greater bulk of his writing," he 
declares, " is neither prose nor verse, and cer- 
tainly it is not an improvement on either. A 
glorious line now and then, and a striking bit 
of color here and there, do not constitute a 
poet — especially a poet for the Peopled It 
would have been strange indeed if these two had 
admired each other ! Browning, whom he else- 
where links with Tennyson in a chance bit of 
passing commendation, he describes personally 
in a few graphic phrases. 

" I met Browning on three occasions. He was very 
cordial to me in a man-of-the-world fashion. I did not 
care greatly for him personally. Good head, long body.

short legs. Seated, he looked like a giant; standing, 
he just missed being a dwarf. He talked well, but not 
so well as Lowell." 

Of self-criticism and other illuminating com- 
ments that indicate and exemplify Aldrich's 
own literary methods and ideals, there is an 
abundance in these selected letters. To Miss 
Woodman, who soon afterward became Mrs. 
Aldrich, we find him writing, in reference to a 
poem he had sent her in manuscript : 

" See if there are not any passages where the idea is 
not worked out sharply. Obscurity, I think, is a kind 
of stupidity, and I seek to avoid it always." 

In another letter he says : 

" There is only one critic I stand greatly in dread of; 
he becomes keener and more exacting every month; he 
is getting to be a dreadful fellow for me, and his name 
is T. B. Aldrich. There is no let up to him." 

And still again : 

" I have a way of looking at my own verse as if it 
were written by some man I did n't like very well, and 
thus I am enabled to look at it rather impersonally, and 
to discover when I liave fallen into mere * fine writing,' 
a fault I am inclined to, while . I detest it. I think 
' Wyndham Towers ' my best long poem, and * Friar 
Jerome ' the next best." 

The final chapter, as already stated, treats of 
Aldrich as a poet, its predecessors having dealt 
more particularly with his prose. After some 
comment on the exquisite piece of verse entitled 
" Memory " the biographer says : 

" The lasting significance of Aldrich's poetry lies in 
such pieces as this. Psychology, metaphysics, were 
unknown lands to him. Yet with his fine sensitiveness, 
his clear and candid mind, he was no stranger to some 
of the subtlest thoughts, the most wayward and wistful 
moods of his moody age. This alone would not give 
him his peculiar distinction. Other men have been 
more sensitive to the age-spirit, more ' representative.' 
But when Aldrich went to embody the eerie impulse in 
verse the miracle happened. He immortalized the 
moment's exquisite pang of memory or joy or forebod- 
ing, not in shadowy, but in crystalline verse. Impulses 
the most romantic in the world he guided by an instinct 
that was purely classic in its inspired poise. His most 
characteristic work is that in which the terse polish of 
an epigram but makes more memorable the frisson, the 
haunting, heart-searching thrill of the sudden thought. 

" In a complex and quizzical age, an age when 
' The Muse in alien ways remote 
Goes wandering,' 
Aldrich, by the miracle of genius, and by his mastery of 
his art, sang of beautiful and pleasant and sad things 
as simply as an Elizabethan or a Greek singer of the 
Anthology. For those who love poetry as a fine art, 
who read it for pure delight, his place in our literature 
is unique and secure." 

If the book presents an Aldrich who is greater 
than posterity shall be willing to admit, it is 
certainly a common and on the whole a good 
fault in biography — especially in the biography 
of one so lately deceased. But the eulogy is 



temperate, and the work is in general most sat- 
isfying. The carefid gathering of material, the 
consultation with friends of Mr. Aldrich, the 
valuable aid of Mrs. Aldrich, and, not least of 
all, the author's own memories of the poet, have 
combined with his loving study of Mr. Aldrich's 
works to produce a biography that will not soon 
be superseded. The customary pictorial em- 
bellishment is provided ; also a 32-page bibli- 
ography, giving a chronological list of the orig- 
inal editions of Aldrich's writings, and a not 
over-plethoric index. Percy F. Bicknell. 



The French and Indian War in 
America.* 



In his interesting and valuable work on the 
History of the United States and its People, 
Mr. Elroy McKendree Avery has now reached 
the period of the French and Indian War, the 
period that was once felt to be peculiarly 
Francis Parkman's own. Mr. Avery has not 
superseded Parkman ; no one could expect him 
to do that, for the New Englander was both an 
historical specialist of the highest rank and a 
literary genius — two things difficult to find, 
and rarely found in combination. What Mr. 
Avery has done, however, is to take Parkman's 
material, study it carefully, cidl from it gener- 
ously, and then add to it the rich findings of 
investigators subsequent to Parkman. The 
result is par excellence. 

The opening chapter of this, Mr. Avery's 
fourth volume, covers the events of the years 
immediately following King George's War ; and 
in characteristic fashion it describes the evidences 
of social, economic, and educational progress, 
closing with a very careful account of George 
Washington's expedition northward in the inter- 
ests of the Ohio Company. The second chap- 
ter deals with the colonial preparation for the 
last great conflict with France ; the third, the 
fourth, and the fifth, with the quadrilateral cam- 
paign of 1756. Of this campaign, the best- 
known incidents are the Braddock disaster and 
the removal of the Acadians, to both of which 
Avery has done justice, except that in the case 
of the first he might have sought to correct the 
erroneous but widely-diffused idea that Braddock 
was ambuscaded. In the words of Professor 
Bourne of Yale, " The encoimter was a typical 
forest fight ; the British general had sent out

scouts and had taken every precaution against 
surprise, but the trail was narrow, and, as the 
French could fight in front and on both sides, 
his vanguard was thrown into hopeless confu- 
sion." 

Concerning Avery's treatment of the Acadian 
affair, perhaps more might be said than simply 
that he has done the subject justice ; for he has 
evidently a thorough grasp of the material in 
hand, and has shown the Aeadians to be what 
they really were, a litigious, priest-ridden, and 
far from innocent people. That so much false 
sentiment has been expended upon their fate is 
much to be deplored ; for even as exiles they do 
not stand alone, their story has more than one 
parallel in history, and the idealization of them, 
which began with Abbe Raynal, was continued 
by George Bancroft, and found its culmination 
in Longfellow's " Evangeline," had no basis in 
fact. They were disloyal and treacherous to the 
core. That Great Britain might have exacted 
hostages of them as an alternative to removal, is 
sometimes suggested ; but it is doubtful if any- 
thing coidd have made them keep faith. The 
times were too critical for Great Britain to take 
any chances, and the execution of hostages as a 
punishment for betrayal would probably have 
called down upon her in after years an even 
more severe criticism from credulous and un- 
thinking people. As it was, the Home Govern- 
ment was not immediately responsible for the 
removal, the idea of which apparently originated 
with Governor Lawrence of Nova Scotia and was 
heartily approved of by Governor Shirley of 
Massachusetts. Both were fully cognizant of 
the seriousness of the situation. The fate of an 
empire was involved. 

Here and there throughout this interesting 
volume discussions of military occurrences are 
interspersed with graphic descriptions of such 
things as the inefficiency, during the earlier years 
of the war, of the regular army and its officers ; 
the motley character of the Colonial contingent ; 
the failure of local assemblies to respond to the 
urgent needs of the hour ; the participation of 
the Indians and their method of warfare ; and, 
finally, the gross financial corruption of the 
French administrative system in Canada and the 
rivalry between its civil and military authorities. 
Nowhere can the reader possibly get a better 
outlook upon the general situation and the com- 
parative strength of the contestants. 

In his ninth chapter Mr. Avery outlines the 
capture of Louisburg, once the Gibraltar of 
America, now a ruin. That capture was the 
first great step in the British advance, and the 



year 1758, in which it occurred, had only one 
reverse, the loss of Ticonderoga — concerning 
which a note might be added with reference 
to the military tactics of the later eighteenth 
century ; since Abercromby's defeat, like the 
subsequent Battle of Bunker Hill, affords a 
striking illustration of the absurdity of trying 
to carry a fortification by assault. In dealing 
with the ascent to the Plains of Abraham, Mr. 
Avery seems to incline toward those who under- 
estimate the undertaking ; but he is none the less 
an admirer of Wolfe, and classifies the storming 
and capture of Quebec as one of the decisive 
engagements of the world His chapter on the 
Peace of Paris is not so definite as it might be ; 
it partakes almost too much of the nature of a 
digression on court politics. The volume closes 
with two excellent chapters on Indian compli- 
cations, arising on the one hand from Cherokee 
resentment of outrages and encroachments, and 
on the other from the familiar Pontiac con- 
spiracy. 

Before remarking upon a certain historical 
fact that Mr. Avery seems to wish to emphasize 
at this stage of his work, attention should be 
called to the many valuable maps and other 
illustrative material that have been added to an 
already large collection. All who realize the 
close relation existing between geography and 
history cannot fail to appreciate this most re- 
markable and praiseworthy feature of the book. 
Every movement, no matter how slight, of the 
contending armies may be traced, and the coor- 
dination of campaigns thereby understood. And 
now, in returning to the point of emphasis, we 
cannot do better than to quote Mr. Avery's own 
words as given in his preface : " I shall be disap- 
pointed if the careful reader of these volumes does 
not understand, even before he takes up the next, 
that the American Revolution was in the blood, 
and that the Stamp Act and George III. were 
simply irritants that hastened what could not be 
avoided." Annie Heloise Abel. 



A Perennial, Book on Spain.* 

The review of a book sixty years after its 
first appearance may seem somewhat tardy, yet 
nothing that has ever been printed descriptive 
of that spectacular country, Spain, better de- 
serves a fresh notice than Richard Ford's work, 
which has been newly published in attractive 
form, but with its old title, " Gatherings from

Spain." It is a book of perennial interest, and 
stolid is the man who can read its animated 
and racy pages without a consuming desire to 
visit the land they portray. The manuscript 
was probably written with a goose-quill, and 
inevitably some pre-railway information creeps 
in ; but the discussion is mainly of that which 
changes little, especially in Spain ; while the 
manner is so charmingly discursive and the 
style so epigrammatic and picturesque that the 
reader is conscious of holding in his hand one 
of the most entertaining books of travel in the 
language. 

Mr. Richard Ford, an English gentleman of 
refined and artistic tastes, went to Spain in 
1830 for a residence of several years. He 
passed the winters in the south, and during the 
other seasons rambled about the Peninsula on 
horseback, carrying note-book and sketching- 
pad in his saddle-bags. A scholar, an art ama- 
teur, a minute and accurate observer, a collector 
of curious knowledge, and withal a brilliant 
writer, he was able to fill his portfolios with 
the rarest of material. Once more at home in 
Devonshire, in a garden-house of Moorish style, 
shaded by pines, myrtles, and cypresses, brought 
from the Alhambra, Mr. Ford passed several 
years working over his notes and writing his en- 
cyclopaedic " Handbook for Travellers in Spain 
and Readers at Home." This remarkable book, 
really a literary achievement, appeared as one of 
John Murray's red-covered guides. Published 
with this unpretending title most unattractively 
in two formidable volumes of five hundred 
closely-printed pages each, it yet was received 
with enthusiasm, and soon became one of the 
best-known books in England. Prescott called 
it " a perfect treasure, a veritable olla podrida." 
Another writer said : " No work bearing so 
humble a title ever enjoyed or deserved so imme- 
diate, so wide, and so enduring a popularity "; 
while Sonnenschein, who can never be charged 
with " mushy appreciations," says of it in his 
great "Reader's Guide": " Ford's detailed study 
of the nation is the standard authority, quite 
classical in value. Most modem writers have 
borrowed from it." 

In 1846, somewhat over a year after the 
" Handbook " was published, the author selected 
and improved those portions which had a more 
general interest, and published them as " Gather- 
ings from Spain." As the title indicates, this is 
the pick, the cream of the " Handbook," shorn 
of its guide-book features. It tells the best 
months to visit different portions of the penin- 
sula, gives a survey of its geography, geology. 



and botany, describes the roads, discusses the 
breeds of horses and mules of the various dis- 
tricts, the harnesses, the manner of driving, and 
the language used to animals, including instruc- 
tions on swearing in Spanish. Riding and 
walking tours are planned and outlined with 
full detail. A chapter is devoted to rivers ; two 
to wines, naming the best varieties and most 
celebrated vineyards ; one to smoking ; others to 
eating, costumes, what courtesies to observe, 
what pleases the Spaniard and what he resents ; 
in short, all that the intending traveller or the 
curious reader likes best to know. Two excel- 
lent chapters treat of the bull-fight, descriptively, 
historically, and philosophically. 

Mr. Ford is a most admirable adviser of what 
to observe and what to do. Reading his book 
is like having a long and delightful chat with a 
comfortable full-blooded sort of fellow, not 
without his prejudices, but who loves Spain and 
is intimately acquainted with it. His epitaph 
to-day reads : Rerum Hispanim indagator 
acerrimus. George G. Brownell. 



Briefs on New Books. 



" A Happy Half-Century" is the title 
When fame chosen by Miss Aenes Repplier for 

came easily. •' r i- i 

her new volume of light essays 

(Houghton), for the reason that explains, the period 
referred to (about 1775 to 1825) is one in which 
she would like to have lived because literary fame 
was then so easily won. In her customary pleasant 
fashion, and with abundance of apt quotation, she 
makes the reader share with her a sort of amused 
superiority to the persons pricked by her somewhat 
pitiless pen, held up writhing for a moment on 
its cruel point, and then consigned again to a well- 
earned oblivion. It was the half-century of Mrs. 
Chapone's much-belauded "Letters on the Improve- 
ment of the Mind "; of Glover's " Leonidas," an epic 
in nine books, which the author thriftily expanded 
into twelve when he found the book-buying public so 
tolerant of bombast; of Darwin's "Botanic Garden," 
enthusiastically admired, and translated into French, 
Italian, and Portuguese; and of Mrs. Charlotte 
Smith's "Emmeline," which rivalled in popularity 
even " The Mysteries of Udolpho," and procured for 
Mrs. Smith's son easy advancement in the Indian 
service. " We sigh," says Miss Repplier, " to think 
how many ladies became famous against their wills 
a hundred and fifty years ago, and how hard it is 
now to raise our aspiring heads "; henee the adjec- 
tive she applies to the half-century, although in 
reality she makes it out to have been a decidedly 
dreary half-century for the readers of its platitudin- 
ous ponderosities in multi-voluminous book form. It 
was the age of the " accursed annual," in the essay-

ist's own words ; the age of the Album Amicorum, 
flowing with watery sentiment — if halting verse can 
be said to flow ; and the age in which, as Miss 
Repplier puts it, the most frivolous occupation of the 
good boy (in the story-book ) is searching the Bible, 
" with mamma's permission," for texts in which 
David " praises God for the weather." Let us, how- 
ever, be indulgent, and remember, as we turn in 
weariness from much of the literature of the " happy 
half -century," that the paradox of one age is the 
platitude of the next. Probably the happy half- 
centurians found their books as wise and as witty 
as we find ours. But the wisdom and wit of Miss 
Repplier's observations concerning those books and 
their readers they could not, unfortunately, without 
committing an unpermissible anachronism, enjoy. 



Essays 

worth 

reading. 



American readers of Sir Spencer 
Walpole's " Essays, Political and 
Biographical" (Button) will no 
doubt be most generally interested in the author's 
estimates of American institutions and men. He 
appreciates the greatness of the American Republic, 
and his sympathies are freely and cordially ex- 
pressed. In a well-written paper on the Causes of 
the American Civil War, inspired, it appears, by 
the historical work of Mr. J. F. Rhodes, the author 
declares that " perhaps of all the men born to the 
Anglo-Saxon race in the nineteenth century, Lincoln 
deserves the highest place in history." And in his 
essay on Lord Granville he emphasizes the services 
of that statesman, in 1862, in preventing the English 
government from assuming a hostile attitude toward 
the United States; and apropos of the Treaty of 
Washington (1871) he makes the statement that 
Lord Granville, " when he left the foreign office in 
1874 . . . had given his country the gjreatest boon 
which it had ever received from any Foreign 
Minister: the assurance of peace with the United 
States." All the papers are interesting and readable 
— excellent specimens of the author's genial style. 
The subjects are largely political, but not exclusively 
so: the paper on the Dining Societies of London has 
no political interest, and the sketch of the diplomatic 
activities of the Russian "ambassadress," Madame 
de Lieven, should probably be classed as biograph- 
ical. But the essays dealing with George Savile, 
Godolphin, the Croker Papers, and the History of 
the Cabinet, are popular discussions of problems in 
English history and politics written with the ease of 
one who is master of subject and style. 



Forces and 
tendencies 
of society. 



The words "Modernism and Ro- 
mance " give the title of a volume 
from the pen of Mr. R. A. Scott- 
James, and are fairly descriptive of the contents. 
The whole is intended to form a continuous argu- 
ment ; and various authors and books are selected 
" as examples of certain intellectual or emotional 
forces which are working in our midst and are 
moulding the psychical organism of society." There 
are sixteen chapters, with such captions as " Science 



and Vandalism," " The Decadents," " The Apostles 
of Protest," and " The New Romance." In each 
chapter he discusses representative authors ; thus, 
under " The Fugitives " he writes of Laf cadio 
Hearn, Miss Edith Durham, Pierre Loti, and Jack 
London ; under " The Self-Conscious Poet," of Mr. 
W. B. Yeats, Mr. Stephen Phillips, and Mr. John 
Davidson. His criticism is a good example of the 
theme of his closing chapter, ''The Personal Note 
in Criticism," in the course of which he says : "The 
effort to put off the convention of form and rely 
upon the trained faculty of insight may indeed 
result in foolish judgments from the foolish, but it 
will give us wise judgments from the wise." The 
individual essays in the book are bright as well as 
thoughtful, although one must often differ from the 
writer's opinions, literary or other. For example, 
it is surely a rather intrepid and extreme admirer 
who would now say of Lafcadio Hearn that " he was 
probably the first among Englishmen who realised 
the sterner foundations of Japanese character." 
England has hardly based her political relations 
with Japan on the lighter side of the Japanese 
character, or depended on Mr. Hearn for initial 
knowledge of her interesting Asiatic ally. Judging 
the volume as a whole, we must feel, despite the 
many meritorious parts and frequency of suggestive 
or even stimulating passages, that the author has not 
achieved the unity and comprehensiveness for which 
the title and introduction led us to hope. But every 
thoughtful reader wiU appreciate the value of any 
sane attempt to connect scattered works with general 
tendencies. (John Lane Co.)

words to direct them to " The Uni- 
corn from the Stars, and Other Plays " (Macmillan). 
There will, perhaps, be readers of " The Celtic Twi- 
light " and " The Secret Rose " who have not read 
" The Land of Heart's Desire " or " The Countess 
Cathleen " ; and to these we may say that in this 
volume of plays Mr. Yeats presents in a new form 
some of the motives of his earlier work. Cathleen 
ni Houlihan, for instance, was one of the subjects of 
song of Hanrahan the Red, in the days when he lived 
in the Burrough with Margaret Rooney and her crony 
Mary Gillis. But there are also those who have but 
a vague idea of Mr. Yeats and his dramatic work. 
For such outsiders we will say that one of the phases 
of the Celtic Renaissance has been the revival of a 
national drama in Ireland. The movement is not 
old : we believe that it was about 1900 when the Irish 
Literary Theatre was founded, for which Mr. Yeats 
and others wrote plays that generally put forward the 
conception of national Ireland. Readers will also 
remember " The Bending of the Bough," by Mr. 
George Moore. The present volume includes three 
plays written for the successor to the Irish Literary 
Theatre, two by Mr. Yeats, and the one that gives 
its name to the volume, by himself and Lady Gregory. 
We believe that " The Hour Glass " and "Cathleen

ni Houlihan " have been published before ; but 
" The Unicorn from the Stars " was only given last 
year. Of these plays we can hardly attempt a criti- 
cism in a few words. They are an approximation 
to an Irish folk-drama, using popular Irish tales as 
material and popular Irish language as means. And 
they are really popular Irish, not the conventional idea 
of it that many of us may have in mind. The plays 
impress us as having little dramatic character : we 
should say that they conveyed their idea chiefly by 
symbol rather than by action. For, like all neo- 
Celticism, they are symbolic, or at least always have 
the aroma of symbolism. We like to read and enjoy 
them, rather than criticize them. 

A little book with a long title is Dr. 
ana cZ7,:T Thomas Valentine Parker's on "The 

Cherokee Indians ; with Special Ref- 
erence to their Relations with the United States 
Government," which has appeared in the " Grafton 
Historical Series." In a little more than a hundred 
pages, the author gives a sketch of the history of 
the Cherokees from the beginning of their relations 
with the white settlers of North America to the 
Federal legislation of 1902. The narrative is inter- 
esting, if somewhat annalistic ; and the facts are 
generally accurate. In a work of this size, con- 
densation is necessary and desirable; but Dr. 
Parker's methods of selection have led him to 
present rather a brief against the governments of 
Georgia and the United States for their misdeeds in 
connection with the Cherokees than a scientific 
treatment of an important phase of American his- 
tory. In the broader relations of the Indian ques- 
tion, the book is very weak. There is no index, 
but a bibliography is added, which, like the text, is 
somewhat remarkable in its inclusions and omissions. 
Thus, one finds an enumeration by years of the 
several annual " Reports of Indian Commissioner," 
from 1860 to 1902, while an obscure reference to 
" Fifth Annual Report, Bureau of Ethnology " is 
the only recognition of Dr. Royce's valuable mono- 
graph, to which Dr. Parker might wisely have been 
more generous of acknowledgment. There is an 
imposing array of references to Congressional 
Documents by their serial numbers ; but confidence 
is somewhat shaken when one discovers such an 
omission as that of the correspondence concerning 
the emigration of the Indians, contained in Senate 
Document No. 512, parts 1-5, 23rd Congress, First 
Session. Dr. Parker's text, however, though par- 
tisan in tone, is a good popular introduction to the 
subject of the Government's dealings with the 
Cherokees ; and this, doubtless, is the place which 
the author has wished that it should fill. 



In an isolated desert-rimmed plateau 
LtelZZTo. «" ^^« °«^th edge of the Grand 

CaSon of Arizona, two hundred and 
fifty miles from Flagstaff " and only two drinks on 
the trail," there lives a man who has spent his long 
life in the pursuit of wild animals. He has hunted 



every well-known wild beast of western North Amer- 
ica, and he has never killed anything except when 
the necessity of getting a living or of defending 
human life drove him to it. The fun of hunting for 
him is not in killing, but in capturing and taming 
his prey. His greatest achievement is represented 
by the herd of buffalo that browse on his range. 
Intent upon saving the vanishing race, he spent 
ten years, in the seventies, hunting, capturing, and 
taming the animals that became the founders of his 
herd ; and his success brought him fame and the 
sobriquet of " Buffalo Jones." A summer or two 
ago. Dr. Zane Grey accompanied the veteran fron- 
tiersman on a cougar hunt, with a visit to the buffalo 
farm and a round-up of wild mustang thrown in. In 
" The Last of the Plainsmen " (Outing Co.) Dr. Grey 
has told the story of the lion-hunt at first hand, in- 
terspersing with it the camp-fire tales he heard of 
other of his host's adventures. Chief among these 
are the account of the memorable day when he roped 
eight buffalo calves, — whereas it had generally 
taken him weeks to get one, — and of the musk-ox 
hunt in the Barren Lands, when hard-won success 
was turned to failure at the last minute by the 
treachery of the northern Indians. Out of his long 
experience Mr. Jones reaches the verdict that " the 
tame wild animal is the most dangerous of beasts," 
that it takes years to understand any animal's mode 
of reasoning — an indispensable requisite to dealing 
with it, — and that conquering by kindness is an 
empty phrase as applied to wild things. Dr. Grey 
is an enthusiastic sportsman, alive to the pictur- 
esqueness both of Western scenery and Western 
character. He is also a skilful photographer of still 
life, and has furnished many interesting pictures of 
the country in which he hunted.

Stirrirw tales of ^ ^ ^^ ^^^gj. romantic period of 
Great Ralegh." ,. , , . ^ • o- -nr li. r> ^ u 

English history is Sir Walter Ralegh. 

The facts of his life furnish forth a tale as stirring 
as any of our novels of adventure and daring. We 
have in him the love of the sea, with all its mystery 
and tragedy, the reaching forth into the unknown 
with, at that time, its boundless possibilities, the 
actual adventure with suspicious Indians and hostile 
Spaniards, and the final conflict with unscrupulous 
enemies at home reaching even to the cowardly 
occupant of the throne. So, too, we have the won- 
derful charm of the man, which appealed equally 
to the Indian in his native wilderness and to the 
great Queen herself, his conscientiousness which led 
directly to the scaffold, his stern sense of duty, and 
his simple piety. Such is the man admirably pre- 
sented in his latest biography, Hugh de Sflincourt's 
"Great Ralegh" (Putnam). Even though the 
book is written for the general reader with its 
caveat for " scholasticus " — usually a warning to 
be heeded by both learned and laity — the liveli- 
ness with which the story is told will recommend it 
to one already familiar with the facts. A graphic 
picture is given of "the spacious times of great

temptible James. The record of Ralegh's trial, his 
last and ill-fated expedition, and his magnificent 
death, still grips one as if the story were not as 
familiar as a twice-told tale. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Of the political figures of the last century that con- 
tinue to loom large on the national stage, one of the 
most interesting is that of John C. Calhoun the great 
Nullifier. An excellent account of his political career 
has been written for the " American Crisis Biographies " 
(Jacobs), by Mr. Gaillard Hunt, showing clearly the 
development of Calhoun's opinions and of his hold upon 
the South, imtil he became a man of one idea and the 
political dictator of his section. An interesting phase 
of Calhoun's development is his change from a strong 
national theory of government and vigorous activity as 
a national statesman, to the extreme States-rights theory 
as the author and responsible leader of the movement 
for practical nullification. This change and the reasons 
for it are clearly brought out by Mr. Hunt, whose 
treatment of his subject is marked by sympathy and 
intelligence. While the work does not show the bril- 
liancy that made Von Hoist's similar biography so 
notable twenty-five years ago, its fairness to all parties 
makes it more trustworthy. 

The Library of the University of Iowa has issued a 
little " Handbook " (of vest-pocket proportions, or very 
nearly) which gives interestmg facts, historical and 
descriptive, concerning this veritable phoenix of a 
library that has twice risen from its ashes within the 
last dozen years. That the Trustees had caught the 
true library spirit as early as half a century ago is 
shown by the fact that " when in 1858 it became neces- 
sary to close the University because of lack of funds, 
provision was made to care for the library during 
the interim and to replenish it 'as circimistances may 
require.' " Noteworthy is it that even this library for 
serious and responsible readers and students is a closed- 
shelf and not an open-shelf library — except at the 
librarian's discretion. 

" A Spanish Reader for Beginners in High Schools 
and Colleges," by Professor Charles Alfred Tyrrell is 
sent us by the American Book Co., who also publish a 
text of Seiiora Avellaneda's " Baltasar," edited by Dr. 
Carlos Bransby. This remarkable Biblical drama in 
verse is the work of a Spanish woman of Cuban birth, 
who died in 1873, and whose varied writings occupy a 
high place in contemporary Spanish Uterature. Dr. 
Bransby's introduction to this edition is of much value. 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. are the publishers of a text 
of Valera's « Pepita Jim<«nez," edited by Mr. G. L. 
Lincoln. Unfortunately, the text is abridged, which 
fact considerably qualifies our satisfaction m its present 
publication. 

A book much after the manner and purport of Samuel 
Smiles s " Self-Help " is that by the Rev. Madison C. 
Peters entitled " The Strenuous Career, or Short Steps 
to Success " (Laird & Lee) . The vohmae is packed with 
edifying examples of worldly success attained in the face 
of obstacles; and these are strung together on a thread 
of good common-sense moralizing. The author warns 
his readers that the fruits of success turn to ashes in the 
mouth unless the success sought be a high and worthy 



one. True success, he points out, " lies not in getting 
what you desire, but in achieving that which will elevate 
and ennoble yourself and at the same time confer some 
benefit on your kind, — a success which will be measiu-ed 
by its contribution to the world's welfare and happiness." 
The combination of worldly wisdom with sound moral 
standards, which the author shows, makes the book a safe 
and helpful one to put in the hands of aspiring youths. 



Notes. 



« The Prairie," " The Pathfinder," and «< The Pioneers " 
are three volumes of Cooper now republished as " Cam- 
bridge Classics " by the Houghton Mifflin Co. 

" A Financial and Administrative History of Mil- 
waukee," by Mr. Laurence M. Larson, is a recent issue 
of the " Bulletin of the University of Wisconsin." 

" First Year in United States History," by Mr. Melvin 
Hix, is an elementary work in two volume*, well illus- 
trated, now published by Messrs. Hinds, Noble, and 
Eldredge. 

A new edition of Professor Richard T. Ely's " Out- 
lines of Economics," revised with the collaboration of 
Professors T. S. Adams, M. O. Lorenz, and A. A. Young, 
is now published by the Macmillan Co. 

Messrs. Duffield & Co. publish pretty two-volume 
editions, with colored frontispieces, of " Jane Austen's 
" Pride and Prejudice " and " Sense and Sensibility." 
Mr. R. Brimley Johnson writes the introductions. 

A study of the Sunday laws of the United States is 
the special feature of "The American Jewish Year 
Book " for 5669, which otherwise contains the usual 
miscellany of classified information upon Jewish sub- 
jects. The volume is edited by Mr. Herbert Frieden- 
wald, and issued by the Jewish Publication Society of 
America. 

" The Universal Self-Pronounciag Dictionary of the 
English Language " is a work prepared by Mr. Charles 
Morris, and based upon Webster. " Hurlbut's Handy 
Bible Encyclopaedia," printed upon thin paper and 
abundantly illustrated, is the work of Dr. Jesse Lyman 
Hurlbut. Both books are thumb-indexed, bound in 
flexible leather covers, and published by the John C. 
Winston Co. 

As evidence that interest in books relating to the 
Philippines is constantly on the increase, Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. announce that their " Handbook of the 
Philippines," by Mr. Hamilton M. Wright, has recently 
gone into a second edition, of which a considerable num- 
ber of copies were taken by a London publisher for the 
English market and the balance by a Manila firm for 
sale in the Islands. 

The Macmillan Co. publish a bibliographical com- 
pilation, by Miss Grace Gardner Griffin, of " Writings 
on American History " for the year 1906. This is a 
resumption of the work done for 1902 and 1904 by 
Professors Ridiardson and McLaughlin, and its con- 
tinuance is now guaranteed for at least five years more. 
It is a pity that there should be no immediate hope for 
the bibliography of the two intervening years. 

The name of David Swing, for many years the lead- 
ing Liberal preacher of the West, is held in affectionate 
remembrance by thousands who listened to his eloquent 
sermons and shared in his gentle ministrations. All 
these will be glad to learn that there will soon be pub- 
lished a biography, written by the Rev. Joseph Newton,

[Oct. 16, 



and authenticated by the family of Professor Swing. 
The title is to be " David Swing: Poet-Preacher," and 
the volume will contain portraits and illustrations of 
Professor Swing's Chicago home, and of the old Music 
Hall in which he spoke for so many years. 

An edition of Goethe's " Hermann and Dorothea," 
edited by Professor Waterman T. Hewett, and one of 
Herr Paul Heyse's tale, " Er Soil Dein Herr Sein," 
edited by Dr. Martin H. Haertel, are recent German 
texts from the American Book Co. From Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. we have " Neid," a tale by Herr Ernest 
von Wildenbruch, edited by Professor C. William Pretty- 
man. Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. publish " A First Ger- 
man Book," the work of Professor Greorge M. Howe. 

Professor William Macdonald's " Documentary 
Source Book of American History " gives us, in a single 
volume, a selection of the documents hitherto presented 
in a series of three volumes. Over six hundred pages 
of source material is now offered to students at a 
moderate price. The use of this work should become 
general in our high schools. The student who has this 
book as an adjunct to his narrative text may easily 
double the efficiency of his work. 

Professor A. Schinz is the editor of a volume of 
"Selected Poems by Victor Hugo," published by 
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. The arrangement is sys- 
tematic, and some of the longer poems are abridged. It 
makes a small book, but a satisfactory one, within its 
narrowly restricted limits. The same publishers send 
us a diminutive volume of " Contes Extraits de Myrrha," 
by M. Jules Lemaitre, edited by Mile. E. Rivill^-Rensch. 
The " Lectures Faciles," prepared for the Messrs. Heath 
by Miss Mary Stone Bruce, is a very elementary reading- 
book of brief selections. 

Publication of the limited definitive edition de luxe 
of " The Poems of Madison Cawein " has been taken 
over by Messrs. Small, Maynard & Co. Tlie set con- 
tains an introduction by Mr. Edmund Gosse, and is 
illustrated by photogravures after paintings by Mr. 
Eric Pape. The titles of the five volumes comprising 
the set are as follows: Volume I., " Lyrics and Old 
World Idylls"; Volume II., "New World Idylls and 
Poems of Love"; Volume III., "Nature Poems"; 
Volume IV., " Poems of Mystery and of Myth and 
Romance "; Volume V., " Poems of Meditation and of 
Forest and Field." 

The death of Daniel Coit GUman, which occurred 
at Norwich, Conn., (his birthplace ), on the 13th of this 
month, deprived the coimtry of one of its oldest and 
most successful educators and one of its most useful 
and distmguished citizens. He was a Professor at Yale 
(his alma mater) from 1855 to 1872; then he became 
President of the University of Cahfornia; and in 1875 
he took up his great work as President of the yoxmg 
Johns Hopkins University at Baltimore, which he con- 
tinued for twenty-five years, resigning his trust at the 
beginning of the new century. Since then he has ren- 
dered many honorable and important public services, as 
President of the Carnegie Institute, of the National 
Civil Service Reform League, of the American Oriental 
Society, etc. He has been especially active in the pro- 
motion of educational work at the South. Dr. Gilman's 
published writings include books and magazine articles 
on educational and scientific subjects, and several im- 
portant biographies. This is but an outline of Dr. 
GUman's varied activities, which continued to the time 
of his death, in his 78th year.

The Hibbert Journal 

y4 Quarterly Review of Religion, 
Theology, and Philosophy 



THE OCTOBER NUMBER begins the seventh 
volume, and is a remarkable issue both in the 
broad scope and compelling interest of its unusual 
contents. The world-wide range of notable con- 
tributors, as well as the diversity of their subjects, 
is seen below. All shades of religious and philo- 
sophical belief are represented. The unsolicited 
statement from more than one authoritative 
source, that THE HIBBERT is the greatest quar- 
terly in the world, is surely well borne out by 
this number. 

Some of the Leading Articles for October : 

THE MISCARRIAGE OF UFE IN THE WEST. By 

SRI RAMANATHAN, Solicitor-General, Ceylon. 
A CHINESE STATESMAN'S VIEW OF REUGION. 

By CHARLES JOHNSTON, late Bengal Civil Service.

appeal instantly and throughout its entire length to the lover of the outdoor life." —Boston Transcript.

the steps that lead up to it, and we congratulate the public upon having secured a bit of literature of new flavor." — New 
York Times Review. (The complete two-column review on request.)

' ' Of unusual interest. Written by the only journalist at the front during the Pulajan campaigm of 1904-1905, the work has 
the freshness of first-hand observation, the vivid picturesqueness of the trained reporter, and the vigor of a man accustomed 
to write cable dispatches. More than a novel : it is also a sensational political pamphlet."— r/ie Nation. 

" First worthy romance with scenes laid in our Eastern islands. The love story is the real thing." — N. Y. Times Review. 

Edgar Wallace's Angel Esquire 

A highly ingenious mystery story in which an inexperienced girl has to contend with three daring criminals for 
millions strangely bequeathed to one of the four. $1.50. 

" Inspiring originality. Mr. Wallace has achieved the impossible. He has written a detective story having for its hero 
a type absolutely new. Moreover, to make his book completely fascinating he put before his hero a problem of refreshing 
fantasticality. The story grows breathlessly exciting. Through its thrilling developments Angel Esquire moves with an 
airy aplomb that is irresistible. All the time he is smiling, full of quaintness and humor."— iVew York Tribune. 

" One of the very best detective stories for years. A plot of exciting interest, real people, not a single strained situation, 
a detective who is really a charming fellow with a sense of humor that is contagious. A strong and satisfying tale." 

— San Francisco Chronicle.

in 1575. This work, of which so much use was made in Scott's " Kenilworth," is, even apart from the interest of its main 
subject, of the greatest value on account of the list which it contains of the library of a certain Captain Cox, a worthy 
mason, who had "great oversight in matters of story," and which affords us an excellent view of the popular literature

The following Mays are Now Ready : 

AS YOU LIKE IT KING HENRY V. CYMBELINE 

THE MERCHANT OF VENICE TWELFTH NIGHT 

" As more volumes of the Shakespeare Library come in, we appreciate the magnitude of the undertaking." — 77ie Dial. 

" Each of these several series is of interest and value to students of Shakespeare, and every volume bears the cachet of one 
or more of the best living English Shakespearean scholars. The prices, too, are very reasonable. The enterprise affords a rare 
opportunity for collectors of Shakespeareana." — Chicayo Record-Herald. 

" The possessor of these volumes will have at his command an invaluable source-record of all the Shakespeare plays." 
— Boston Transcript. 

" Under the general title of ' The Shakespeare Library ' the firm of Duffield & Co. is bringing out a series of volumes for 
which students of the poet must be very grateful. These volumes may be roughly described as forming a kind of storehouse of 
documents, the purpose of which is to carry the reader into Shakespeare's workshop and make him a sharer in Shakespeare's 
own atmosphere. What books did he use as he pondered the construction of one of his dramas ? What was the form of that 
drama as it actually left his hand? These and kindred questions are answered by the series, in which some twelve or fifteen 
volumes have already appeared. Incidentally the student is afforded light on Shakespeare's time, and the manners and moods 
of his contemporaries. It would be difficult to exaggerate the value of these books. They are not, of course, unfamiliar to 
scholars, but on the other hand, they have not hitherto been collected in such convenient and inexpensive form and thereby 
made so easily accessible to a large circle of readers." — Neiv Turk Tribune.

need of the swaddling clothes in which each are still enveloped — though 
religion be considered the less advanced. 

" To that end science must extend its field of investigation into regions 
now usually regarded as too unsubstantial for scientific treatment, while 
religion, on its part, must invite and challenge just such rigid inquiry as 
science requires, and give up the primitive and ignorant notion that seek- 
ing the truth in certain directions is impiety."

The Twentieth Century 
American 

Being a Comparative Study of the Peoples of the 
Two Great Anglo-Saxon Nations. 

By H. PERRY ROBINSON, author of " Men Bom Equal," 
" Autobiography of a Black Bear," etc. Crown Svo. 
$1.75 net. 

" An elaborate plea, novel and interesting, for an Anglo- 
American alliance, or at least a close association of inter- 
ests and purposes. . . . The observations on the resem- 
blances and dissimilarities of the English and American 
characters are often acute and striking. No summary of 
leading points can do justice to Mr. Robinson's book, or go 
further than to suggest the scope and variety of the topics 
touched upon. 

The volume must be read to be appreciated, and it ought 
to be widely read and attentively pondered."

BY THEIR FRUITS (Third Printing) By Mrs. CAMPBELL PRAED 

With Frontispiece in Colors by Charles Pears. Cloth. $1,50. 

JUSTIN McCarthy in The Independent (New York) comments as follows : " I may certainly venture to say that the 
reader who begrins it will not be in the least likely to think it too long. It is a powerful story, thrilling' with interest 
from first to last, and with character drawing which in some of its figures displays a genuine and captivating originality. 
... I only desire to call the attention of my American readers to the fact that By Their Fruits is well deserving of 
prompt and close attention at a time when the tendency of fiction is certainly not to occupy itself with the production of 
too many novels likely to arouse an earnest and absorbing interest."

NAPOLEON 
and His Fellow Travellers 

By CLEMENT SHORTER 

Editor of The Sphere. Author of Immortal Memories, 
With 8 Plates, $i.00 net, 

ANEW book on Napoleon can only be justified by the 
fact that it contains interesting new material or ma- 
terial not generally available to the public. Mr. Clement 
Shorter has brought together some rare and little known 
books that have never been reprinted since their first pub- 
lication, well-nigh a century ago. 

A rare pamphlet, privately printed by Lord Lyttleton, 
gives an account of interesting conversations with Na- 
poleon on board the Northumberland. The vivid story 
of Napoleon's appearance and conversation at the time 
of his surrender, by George Home, in " The Diary of an 
Aristocrat," a book suppressed on publication, also 
makes attractive reading. A dramatic story of one of 
the most vivid episodes in modern European history, 
told with a freshness that will prove a revelation to the 
present generation.

IN view of the present state of Russia's internal affairs, 
this book has, in addition to the intrinsic human inter- 
est, a profound political significance. As explained in a

unanswered argument against despotic power.

STUDIES IN THE SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY OF SEX 

By WILLIAM I. THOMAS 

ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 

320 Pages, 12ino, cloth; net $1.50, postpaid $1.65 

TT is doubtful if any other book published in the last ten years has created as much 
discussion as "Sex and Society." There is little profit in recalling the storm of 
ridicule and abuse that burst forth when the book was first published. Many of 
those who publicly denounced the work and its author have since retracted their first 
opinion and have acknowledged that it was based on an imperfect understanding of 
Professor Thomas's meaning. That there should have been such a misunderstanding 
is in itself a surprising fact, since the book is written with extraordinary clearness and 
vividness. Few books of a strictly scientific character can be read with so much 
pleasure and profit by the intelligent layman. The book does not "preach," but 
sums up in a style of singular power and felicity the position of modern woman and 
the underlying causes that have made her what she is.

THE EDUCATIONAL REFIEff^,io\inded in 1891, commands the support of every prominent 
student of education, both in the United States and in Europe. 
It is not an educational newspaper ; it is not a journal for the presentation of schoolroom methods ;

It is the organ of representative students of education ; it is national and international in scope, 
and catholic in sympathy; its field of interest includes educational work of every form and grade. 
The readers of the Educational Review are studious teachers and students of education who 
wish to know the ripest thought, the newest investigations, and the best books on education. 

" In editing the Re'vieiv you have done a valuable and much needed vrork for education in the United States."

CHARLES ELIOT NORTON. 



The life of colonial New England, resting 
upon the granite of puritan character, was richly 
provided with the elements of sincerity and 
strength, but was singularly devoid of the qual- 
ity of charm. Two centuries of weathering were 
needed to disintegrate the rock, and cover it with 
a soil in which culture might take root and 
flourish. When the time came, the soil proved 
richly fruitfiJ, and from it sprang the fine 
flowers of ethical order and exalted patriotism, 
of aesthetic feeling and literary art. With that 
efflorescence of the spirit of man in the new 
world, America first achieved a literature of its 
own, and adorned its annals with the names of 
Bryant and Longfellow and Whittier, of Haw- 
thorne and Lowell and Emerson. As com- 
pared with these names, the name of the quiet 
scholar who passed away at Cambridge on the 
twenty-first of October was less resounding in 
the world of publicity, but it does not seem too 
much to say that in penetrative influence upon 
American character the man who bore it was 
the peer of any of his contemporaries. We can 
think of no man who has embodied more fully 
and satisfactorily than Charles Eliot Norton 
the distinctive qualities of that idealism toward 
which we still believe, despite all discourage- 
ments, that our best self as a nation aspires. 

Mr. Norton was born November 16, 1827, 
and consequently lived until his eighty-first year 
was all but completed. The trees of Shady Hill 
that waved over his cradle were the trees that 
filled the air with autumnal murmurs as he drew 
his last breath ; for he was one of the few who 
in this country of ours have the double fortune 
of living to venerable age and of dying under 
the roof -tree that sheltered their infancy. The 
fact may be taken as symbolical of the steadfast 
continuity with which his fourscore years were 
devoted, with a singleness of purpose imderlying 
all their variety of occupation, to the pursuit of 
essential virtue and truth and beauty. It was 
in or near his Cambridge home that he labored 
all the years of his active life, save for his brief 
period of faring abroad on business in early 
manhood, for his occasional European sojourns, 
and for his many summers at Ashfield, among 
the hills of western Massachusetts. And for the 



278 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



last half -century Shady Hill has been sought 
out by the wise and good of other lands as the 
Mecca of their American pilgrimage, and by the 
fellow-countrymen, old and young, of the sage 
who lived there, for the sake of its gracious 
hospitality, and the inspiration of personal con- 
tact with its master. 

As the son of Andrews Norton, himself iden- 
tified with the college for fifty years, Charles 
naturally became a son of Harvard, and was 
graduated with the class of 1846, at the age of 
nineteen. Among his classmates were Child and 
Lane (later his colleagues), Fitzedward Hall and 
George Frisbie Hoar. The first few years after 
his graduation were spent in business, and in 
1849 he went on a voyage to the East Indies 
as supercargo. But the commercial life did not 
attract him, and he soon took up his studies 
again. He found his chief interest in the his- 
tory of art, and this subject necessarily took 
him to Europe for considerable periods. It was 
upon one of these European trips (in the mid- 
fifties) that he made Ruskin's acquaintance, in 
the cabin of an excursion boat making the trip 
from Vevay to Geneva. The account of this 
meeting, as given in Ruskin's " Praeterita," is 
80 charming that we wiU quote from it at some 
length. 

" I noticed that from time to time the young Amer- 
ican cast somewhat keen, though entirely courteous, 
looks of scrutiny at my father and mother. 

" In a few minutes after I had begun to notice these 
looks, he rose, with the sweetest quiet smile I ever saw 
on any face (imless, perhaps, a nun's when she has some 
grave kindness to do), crossed to our side of the cabin, 
and addressing himself to my father, said, with a true 
expression of great gladness, and of frank trust that his 
joy would be understood, that he knew who we were, 
was most thankful to have met us, and that he prayed 
permission to introduce his mother and sisters to us. 

" The bright eyes, the melodious voice, the simple, 
but acutely flattering, words, won my father in an in- 
stant. The New Englander sat down beside us, his 
mother and sisters seeming at once also to change the 
steamer's cabin into a reception room in their own home. 
The rest of the time till we reached Geneva passed too 
quickly ; we arranged to meet in a day or two again, at 
St. Martin's. 

" And thus I became possessed of my second friend, 
after Dr. John Brown; and of my first real tutor, Charles 
Eliot Norton. 

" The meeting at St. Martin's Avith Norton and his 
family was a very happy one. Entirely sensible and 
amiable, all of them; with the further elasticity and 
acuteness of the American intellect, and no taint of 
American ways. Charles himself, a man of the highest 
natural gifts, in their kind ; observant and critical, rather 
than imaginative, but with an all-pervading sympathy 
and sensibility, absolutely free from envy, ambition, or 
covetousness ; a scholar from his cradle, nor only now a 
man of the world, but a gentleman of the world, whom 
the highest born and best bred of every nation, from the 



Red Indian to the White Austrian, would recognize in 
a moment, as of their caste." 

This characterization by a man of genius 
leaves little to be said, and serves particularly to 
illustrate that faculty for friendship which drew 
into Mr. Norton's intimacy many of the choicest 
spirits of his time. It would be interesting, did 
our space permit, to extend the quotation by 
Ruskins whimsical speculations as to " what sort 
of soul Charles Norton would have become, if he 
had had the blessing to be born an English Tory, 
or a Scotch Jacobite, or a French Gentilhomme, 
or a Savoyard Count." For the writer makes 
it very clear that his new friend does not belong 
to America, being " as hopelessly out of gear 
and place, over in the States there, as a runaway 
star dropped into Purgatory." 

Mr. Norton's early connection with Harvard 
as a teacher took the form of an instructorship 
in 1851 and of a lectureship in 1863-4. It was 
not until ten years after this that he entered 
into his lasting relations with the College. 
Meanwhile, he married Miss Susan Sedgwick 
in 1862, and in the same year joined with Mr. 
Lowell in editing " The North American Re- 
view," an occupation which busied him for six 
years. He was also one of Mr. Godkin's asso- 
ciates in the early years of " The Nation " (begun 
in 1865) , and during the years of the Civil War 
just preceding he acted as secretary of the Loyal 
Publication Society, compiling broadsides which 
strengthened the patriotic heart of the people 
in their struggle to preserve the nation. Even 
earlier than all this, he had been influential 
in bringing about the establishment of " The 
Atlantic Monthly," and was one of the con- 
tributors to its first number. Besides these 
literary activities, he had also found time to 
write two books, " Considerations on Some 
Recent Social Theories," and " Notes of Travel 
and Study in Italy," dated 1853 and 1859 
respectively. 

It was, then, with no mean record of scholarly 
achievement and public service that Mr. Norton, 
in 1874, at the age of forty-six, accepted the 
chair offered him at Harvard by his cousin the 
President. The chair was created for him, and 
he was styled Professor of the History of Art, 
but he interpreted art in a broad sense, and 
found in it as many implications as his friend 
Ruskin. It has been happily said that his real 
academic function was to serve as Professor of 
Things in General, by which is meant simply 
that his conception of art was so liberal, his 
sense of the inter-relationship of all cultural and 
social interests so lively, that he could not nar-

row his work to the mere discussion of aesthetic 
technicalities, but was perforce constrained to 
take within his purview all the deeper concerns 
of human existence. He so vitalized the aca- 
demic spirit of the institution that he became 
easily its most popular teacher, and his class- 
rooms were filled to overflowing. His winning 
manner, and the finished style of his discourse 
proved so attractive to the eager and ingenuous 
young men who thronged to his lectures that it 
became a problem to provide them with accom- 
modation, and it was finally found necessary to 
reduce their numbers by restricting the courses 
to upper classmen. During the twenty-four 
years of his regular teaching, nearly all the stu- 
dents who went through Harvard were found in 
his classes at one time or another. It would be 
difficult to overestimate the extent of the influ- 
ence which he thus exerted upon a whole gener- 
ation of college students — an influence always 
exerted for sanity and restraint, for a correct 
appreciation of art and for the understanding 
of its correlation with life. As President Eliot 
once said : " Thousands of Harvard students 
attribute to his influence lasting improvements 
in their modes of thought, their intellectual and 
moral interests, and their ideas of genuine suc- 
cess and true happiness." The only book that 
resulted from these courses on the history of 
art was published in 1880, and was entitled 
" Historical Studies of Church-Building in the 
Middle Ages." 

During the eighties, he added to his work 
courses on Dante, imparting the results of his 
life-long study of the poet. As early as 1865, 
he had joined with Longfellow and Lowell in 
establishing a little Dante Club in Cambridge, 
which met Wednesday evenings, largely for 
the discussion of Longfellow's translation then 
in active preparation. Mr. Norton's own little 
book on the " Vita Nuova " (an essay with trans- 
lations) had appeared in 1859, and his complete 
version of the work came out in 1867, accom- 
panying his colleague's version of the " Divina 
Commedia." His own prose translation of the 
Comedy was given to the world in 1891-2. 
Not long afterwards he delivered a course of 
lectures on Dante on the Percy Turnbull 
Foundation at the Johns Hopkins University. 
These lectures have never been published, and 
it should be one of the first duties of his literary 
executors to see that they are made into a book. 

Mr. Norton's editorial labors in connection 
with Carlyle, Ruskin, Lowell, and Curtis are 
not the least of his claims upon our gratitude. 
After Fronde's mangled version of the Carlyle 



correspondence, the family turned to Mr. Norton 
for redress, and there resulted " The Corre- 
spondence of Carlyle and Emerson " (1883), 
" The Correspondence of Carlyle and Goethe " 
(1887), and " Carlyle's Letters and Reminis- 
cences" (1887). For the authorized "Brant- 
wood" American edition of Ruskin, extending 
to about a score of volumes, but unfortunately 
far from complete, he wrote the prefatory essays 
in the several volumes. He was Lowell 's literary 
executor, and gave us (1893) the " Letters of 
James Russell Lowell " in two volumes. A year 
later, he had prepared the three volumes of 
" Orations and Addresses " by George William 
Curtis, who was also one of his closest friends. 
He had a true genius for friendship, as these 
instances show, and as is also revealed in the 
published correspondence of Edward FitzGerald, 
Leslie Stephen, and E. L. Godkin, to name only 
a few other examples. These warm relationships 
with his famous contemporaries have sometimes 
led to the ill-natured and unjust assumption that 
his reputation rests upon a parasitical basis. But 
no one who reads the letters which these men 
wrote to him could hold that opinion in good 
faith, or fail to discern the modest self-effacement 
which characterized his relations with them. 

An important part of Mr. Norton's life is 
connected with the town of Ashfield, in western 
Massachusetts, where, with Curtis for a neigh- 
bor, he made his summer Ijome for over forty 
years. He identified himself with the civic life 
of that little community of a thousand souls, 
and inspired it with his own ideals of good 
citizenship. His influence revived the moribund 
Academy of the town, and the institution of the 
Ashfield dinners, held annually in the town hall 
for a quarter of a century, made the place known 
the country over. He presided at these dinners, 
and when the homely fare had been disposed of, 
and the material man was at peace with the 
world, the spiritual man took his place, and 
discussed questions of high social and political 
import, under the leadership of the beloved pre- 
siding officer, and of the distinguished guests 
whom he had brought there to speak. " Ichabod " 
is now the word for Ashfield, but it will long 
remain an inspiring memory. 

It was during the year of our wicked war 
with Spain and of our national orgy of iniquit- 
ous imperialism that Ashfield became best known 
to the country. Mr. Norton had no doubts 
upon the moral issues then involved, and no 
hesitation in condemning the course taken by 
his country in those disastrous years. His Ash- 
field address of August 25, 1898, stirred up a 



280 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



storm of excitement, and brought upon his head 
the sort of villification which is always the lot 
of the far-sighted patriot who dares rebuke his 
fellow-citizens for their lapse from virtue. As 
early as June of that year, when he had just 
retired from his Harvard duties, and accepted 
the title of Professor Emeritus, he had spoken 
upon the same subject in Cambridge with no 
uncertain voice. He had said in closing : 

" My friends, America has been compelled against 
the will of all her wisest and best to enter into a path 
of dar ness and peril. Against their will she has been 
forced to turn back from the way of civilization to the 
way of barbarism, to renounce for the time her own 
ideals. With grief, with anxiety must the lover of his 
country regard the present aspect and the future 
prospect of the nation's life. With serious purpose, 
with utter self-devotion he should prepare himself for 
the untried and difficult service to which it is plain he 
is to be called in the quick-coming years." 

The wisdom and sanity of that utterance will 
sometime receive general recognition. It was 
then the wisdom of a minority, but the decade 
that has since elapsed already shows signs of a 
reaction in the sense of that deliverance, and 
the " untried and difficult service " henceforth 
to be required of American citizenship will be 
more and more accepted as an obligation in the 
days to be. 

The man who takes this position in the face 
of the angry Demos is sure to be called a pessi- 
mist, and the title is a badge of honor. The 
pessimists (in this sense) are about the only 
persons who have done any real good in the 
world. To Mr. Norton, the storm-cloud that 
burst in 1898 had long been gathering. Sev- 
eral years before he had written, in a private 
letter, of " these dark days when the advocates 
of culture and the maintainance of morality in 
politics find their best type in Mrs. Partington," 
and had added : " At any rate, let us use our 
brooms as briskly as we can till the tide quite 
drowns us out." But, however disheartened 
he grew under the pressure of events, he never 
lost faith in the future. And once writing to 
Godkin, he spoke of "the good old cause of 
civilization — the cause which is always de- 
feated, but always after defeat taking more 
advanced positions than ever before." In his 
eightieth year, he said to a friend that if life 
were to be lived over again he thought, for his 
part, that he would like to live it in Chicago, 
because he seemed to see working there, in all 
the welter of vulgarity and commercialism, a 
power for good that would in time come to its 
own. Such hopefidness as that is surely no 
mark of pessimism in any rational meaning of 
the term. 



Mr. Norton received honors that were fairly 
commensurate with his deserts. He was awarded 
the doctorate by numerous universities, includ- 
ing both Oxford and Cambridge. His name 
was one to conjure with wherever scholarship 
was held in esteem. His permanent memorial 
in Harvard is the Library which bears his name, 
provided by a fund collected in 1905 from over 
five hundred subscribers, and having as a nu- 
cleus his own private collection of books. Two 
things remain to be done in his further honor. 
One is the preparation of an adequate biography ; 
the other is the collection of his widely-scattered 
writings. Of the first, we need only say that 
the recipient of such letters, addressed to him 
by such men as Ruskin, FitzGerald, Stephen, 
Lowell, and Godkin, as have already been pub- 
lished, must have given in measure no less rich 
than he received, and that the epistolary material 
for a biography is sure to be abundant. Of the 
second, we would urge that Charles Eliot Norton 
belongs to American literature, and that his 
rightf id place among our authors is to be secured 
and perpetuated only by making generally acces- 
sible to readers the large mass of his writing 
now concealed in the files of periodicals, in 
editorial contributions to other men's books, and 
in his unpublished manuscripts. This pious 
duty should be entered upon at once, and its 
performance based upon the principle that what- 
ever such a man had to say must be worth 
preserving. 



CABBAGES AND ROSES. 



The trend of modern thought has been to assert 
that cabbages are as admirable as roses — nay, that 
they are superior ; for we can eat cabbages, whereas, 
like Du Maurier's poor musician, we do not habitu- 
ally "lif on roses." In almost all contemporary 
criticism this utilitarian idea crops up. We ought 
to admire, we are told, the creations of the modern 
fiction-monger, because he gives us people who are 
of use in the world — farmers, fishermen, doctors, 
engineers ; because these are, as a rule, models of 
unselfish conduct, paragons who do their whole duty 
in this life. How superior they are, how much 
better fitted for our guidance and imitation, than 
the self-centred, imperious saviors or destroyers of 
mankind, the lords of ideal fiction, — Prometheus, 
Achilles, Hamlet, Lear, and their like ! 

The old literature saw everywhere hierarchies of 
spiritual and intellectual beings, of animate and in- 
animate objects. Some incarnations of humanity 
were greater, wiser, more splendid than others ; 
some natural objects were more beautiful and per- 
fect than the rest. The idea of fitness and appro- 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



281 



priateness pervaded art. The heroines Ophelia or 
Belvidera had to go mad in white satin: now we 
put her in a patched frock and sabots. 

It is certain that we are, all of us, striving for 
wealth, power, distinction, or rule. We prefer 
mansions to hovels, athletes to cripples, beautiful 
women to homely ones. The shop-girl dreams of 
being a duchess ; the salesman imagines himself a 
hero. Why should not this universal, this saving 
instinct of mankind for what it deems the best find 
expression in literature? It has always done so 
before, and the finest figures of fiction are the em- 
bodiments of this human worship of greatness and 
beauty. 

The extremes of life are the regions of supreme 
art. On the one side are the princes and poten- 
tates and powers and dominations of the world. It 
is hardly necessary to say that these need not be 
born in the purple, — but they must have heads 
upon which crowns of some kind naturally fall. On 
the other side are the creatures of the gulf and 
gloom, dark apparitions of poverty, madness, rebel- 
lion, and despair. Great art bridges the distance 
between these opposite worlds ; it strides easily from 
Hyperion's palace to Job's dunghill ; from lUyria's 
court to the tavern where Burns's Jolly Beggars are 
congregated ; it discovers in one work Lear on his 
throne dealing out kingdoms, and the same person- 
age crouching on the ground defenseless against the 
outrage of the elements. In the one case the artist 
deals with beauty and grandeur, — and poetry and 
romance come easily to him. In the other case he 
works with shadow and horror, and power is ready 
made to his hands. In both cases the subject is 
given to him and he has only to prove himself 
equal to it. 

But there is a vast extent of life where the sub- 
ject is not given to the artist, where he has, by 
mere handling, to make significant and interesting 
the ordinary and common happenings of mankind. 
This is the region of social comedy and the modern 
novel. Moli^re's work would be mainly of this kind 
were it not that the gods descend from their heights 
in the Misanthrope, and the gulf surges up from 
below in Don Juan, Tartuffe, and the Miser. Re- 
acted upon by humor, this middle region of life 
can become a spectacle of power ; painted merely 
for itself, it is likely to be monotonous, insipid, flat. 

Vanessa said that Dean Swift could write beauti- 
fully about a broomstick. Our modern novelists do 
not often write as well as Swift, but their task is 
essentially to make something out of nothing — to 
dress up the broomsticks of ordinary life so that they 
shall seem animated and strong. It is creditable to 
their skill that they do very frequently produce such 
an illusion, but somehow their work has the trick 
of fading away before that of the creators who take 
the good the gods provide in the shape of great 
characters and actions. 

For there is a difference in the quality of actions. 
These take color and grandeur from their settings 
and surroundings. Generally, things done, spec- 



tacles presented on the stage of the world, are more 
impressive in the eye of mankind than those enacted 
in suburbs or purlieus. A young girl who works to 
support an aged mother or a crippled brother may 
have a heart as pure, a devotion as high, as Jeanne 
d'Arc ; but the depth of spiritual monitions, the 
pomp of state and war, the terror of a fiery doom, 
lift the French maiden out of all comparison with 
humbler fates. 

Modern writers are almost all humanitarians. It 
is an honor to their hearts that they are so — that 
they have taken up the cause of the down-trodden, 
the forgotten, the average human being. They 
have said to themselves that love and joy and pain 
and death are universal, — that there is no reason 
why a poor young clerk should not love with the 
passion of a Romeo, why a deserted girl of the 
streets should not feel as deeply as Marguerite, 
why any mother mourning over her dead should not 
be as great a figure as Niobe or Rizpah. And there 
is perhaps no reason, except that of fitness, if the 
author feels competent to supply three-fourths of the 
capital stock in such characters. If he feels that 
he can afford to throw away subject and rely en- 
tirely on handling, there is no reason why he should 
not do so. 

For while sensation, feeling, emotion are univer- 
sal, intellect is not universal. I am willing to con- 
cede that average or inferior human beings feel as 
deeply as beings of a higher grade ; but they can- 
not express their feelings. They are inarticulate ; 
and art, which is expression, rules out the inarticu- 
late. Romeo is Romeo because of the magnificence 
with which he utters the litany of love. A Mar- 
guerite who could not sing of the King in Thule, 
or plead with her lover about religion, or utter the 
wonderful sentences of the dungeon scene, would be 
a failure. A Lear or a Timon without their kingly 
splendor of thought and speech would be incon- 
ceivable. But the modern novelist may say that 
he can dower his average or inferior character with 
thought and language of his own. Even if he can, 
there is the question of fitness. Ninety-nine times 
out of a hundred the extremes of action and thought 
and speech which go to make up a great character 
in fiction would be ridiculous if brought into the 
milieu of the middle class. 

The whole matter comes round to a question of 
subject. Are there any subjects, actions, themes, 
better than others ? Are there any kind of person- 
ages more suited to exploitation in literature than 
the common ruck of mankind? Are there any 
surroundings — grandeurs or splendors of scenery, 
sunsets, storms, moonlight magnificences, architec- 
tural backgrounds, palaces, gardens, and the like — 
which help and heighten a work of art? In short, 
is there any real difference between cabbages and 
roses ? 

In one of the first and perhaps one of the most 
important of Matthew Arnold's critical pieces, the 
preface to his Early Poems, he deals with this ques- 
tion. The essay is a revolt against the mannered

detailed modern work in poetry — all foreground — 
and an appeal for the large masses and outlines of 
the ancients. Seize a great action, he tells the poet ; 
approximate language will follow. It will — if the 
author is filled with the power of his theme, capable 
of being thrilled by its significance. Great actions 
are usually the results of great causes ; they take 
place among those who have that stamp of intellec- 
tual superiority which, far more than emotional agita- 
tion, is the mark of the highest type of literary 
creation. Emotion must exist in them, but it must 
find vent in deeds and words which denote mental 
power. The modern novelist, in painting the average 
man and woman, is necessarily debarred from great 
actions. His sense of fitness keeps him from put- 
ting into the mouths of his characters that concen- 
trated intellectual speech which was the privilege 
of the poets of the past. He tries to make up for 
these deficiencies by the analysis of character and 
of moods of mind. But just so far as he pushes 
this, his figures lose validity and vitality. They are 
seen to be puppets moved by himself — or, at the 
best, dissections of dead souls. 

Life seen near at hand is mostly detail. The 
trivial, the unimportant, the commonplace, do not 
fall away and leave the masses and the meanings of 
the scene apparent. Real contemporary life, there- 
fore, would seem to be suited mainly to comedy and 
social satire. Not until we get away from the foot- 
hills do the great mountains loom up. It is not 
that the heroic age is past — that there are no great 
souls, mighty intellef.ts, wonderful actions, magnifi- 
cent settings for deed and character to-day. All 
these things doubtless crowd the world. But just 
as the singular and superb figures and actions which 
gleam to us out of the past were in their own time 
obscured by rivals or inferiors, so with us our best 
is hidden and hustled away in the multitude of 
happenings. In this sense it may be said that the 
commonplace is the uncommon which has not yet 
been tested by time and space. 

Practically, the great artists of literature who 
have brooded deepest over life have affected the 
distant or the past for their creations. They were 
not foolish enough to doubt that human life is al- 
ways essentially the same ; they did not really 
believe in any Age of Gold, or Day of the Gods. 
But they knew that to evolve tragedy, romance, 
poetry, they must get away from the garish light of 
their own hour. All the great epic poems are pro- 
jections against the mists of antiquity. The great 
dramas are founded on traditions and legends of 
historical or immemorial past. Shakespeare has not 
one play of contemporary life — or if the Italian 
Comedies are contemporary, they get from remote- 
ness what they lack in age. Again and again 
modern poets and romance writers have entered the 
grave of the past to resurrect it. Goethe and 
Schiller, the German Romanticists, Scott, Byron, 
Rossetti, Hawthorne, Poe — one would have to call 
the roll of modern literature to name all who have, 
in the main, avoided their own day and their own 



native life. To be sure, there are exceptions. Per- 
haps Hugo's Les Miserables is the most remarkable 
effort to find romance and tragedy at home. Is it 
successful? And are the Realists — the men and 
women of the last great revolt in literature, the 
artists who have refused to paint except direct from 
the model — are they successful ? In comedy, in 
social satire, there can of course be no doubt: that 
is their province, and Jane Austen and a hundred 
successors must live in letters. But in tragedy, in 
romance, have the Realists, the greatest of them, — 
Balzac, Turgenieff, Zola, Tolstoi, — done anything 
that will last beside the work of the older schools ? 
Time alone can tell. Yet these authors have one of 
the sources of power that I have indicated above : 
they dive into the depths and draw forth its crea- 
tures of gloom and horror. They deal little with 
average fairly-contented or happy humanity. If 
anything saves them from posterity, it will be their 
pessimism. Charles Leonard Mooee. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



An educator and administrator of more 
THAN NATIONAL FAME was Daniel Coit Gilman, 
whose recent death was briefly noted in our last 
issue. Although we are inclined to identify him 
chiefly with the Johns Hopkins University, of 
which he was the first president and whose destinies 
he controlled for a quarter-century, his leadership in 
other good causes and large enterprises was enough 
to make him famous. His first educational position, 
after a thorough training at home and abroad, was 
the librarianship at Yale, to which he was appointed 
in 1855, at the age of twenty-four. But he soon 
transferred his interests and energies from the 
library to the class-room, being made professor of 
physical and political geography, and about the 
same time also secretary of the governing board of 
the Sheffield Scientific School. Two other offices, 
the superintendency of public schools and the sec- 
retaryship to the State Board of Education, fell to 
him before leaving New Haven, in 1872, to assume 
the presidency of the new University of California. 
His acceptance, three years later, of the task of 
shaping the first real university in this country, — 
"a place for the advanced special education of 
youth who have been prepared for its freedom by 
the discipline of a lower school," in Dr. Gilman's 
own words, — and his splendid success in building 
up an institution that soon ranked with the old uni- 
versities of Europe, are matters too familiar to need 
dwelling on here. The work of his last years as 
head of the Carnegie Institution at Washington, 
and his literary labors — chief of which is his 
" Life of James Monroe " in the American States- 
men Series — are less familiar to the public. Curi- 
ously enough, and perhaps somewhat unfortunately.

ministration, to dealing with men and rubbing

elbows with the world, had developed in him a cast 
of countenance that bespoke shrewdness and hard 
common sense rather than profound learning and 
intimate acquaintance with the world of letters. 
Thus he sometimes failed of being credited with 
the scholarship, wide rather than deep, that he un- 
doubtedly possessed. , , , 

The iniquitous book publisher, that cruel 
taskmaster who grinds the faces of poor authors 
and stubbornly refuses to conduct his business 
solely for the glory of literary art and the speedy 
emolument of writer-folk, plies his shameful trade 
from Greenland's icy mountains to India's coral 
strand (with some allowance for poetic license), 
and from where Aurora first tints with pink the 
morning sky to where Phoebus's car descends afar 
in a blaze of glory into the western wave. The 
"Japan Times" prints an article deploring the yoke 
of poverty imposed by publishers on the necks of 
long-suffering authors, and announcing the forma- 
tion of an association for diverting the stream of 
yen now pouring into publishers' pockets so that it 
shall henceforth empty into the purses of authors. 
" The Association," the writer proceeds, in language 
that we take pleasure in reproducing unaltered, 
*' has been mooted under the name ' Fushin-kai ' by 
Messrs. Kikutei Taguchi, Shunyo Yanagawa, and 
others. According to its prospectus, members shall 
produce one work each every year ; the copyright 
shall be preserved by the Association, ten per cent 
of the proceeds from the sale of the book shall be 
granted to the author, and the remainder shall be 
appropriated to the funds of the Association. The 
principal object of proceeding funds is to render re- 
lief to members." All very beautiful, but incom- 
plete. How about disastrous ventures? Will ten 
per cent of the losses on an unsuccessful book be 
collected from the author and the remainder de- 
ducted from the " proceeding funds " of the Asso- 
ciation, or levied on its members ? And is there to 
be any censorship or control of the works that the 
members are expected, willy-nilly, to produce, 
" one work each every year " ? Brave schemes like 
this have flourished (in glowing prospectus) nearer 
home than Japan ; but like the famous and ( in all 
respects but one) admirable plan for belling the 
cat, their largeness of promise throws into total 
eclipse their meagreness of accomplishment. 

A German Oscar Wilde, in the person of 
Franz Wedekind, is writing for the now world re- 
nowned " Chamber Theatre " in Berlin plays that 
are described as ultra-realistic, with strong lean- 
ings toward the erotic. The extreme realism is 
more properly Zolaesque, but interwoven are bits 
of epigram and repartee not unworthy of Oscar 
Wilde at his best. The theatre's revolving stage, 
with its seven faces for successive presentation to 
the audience, makes possible a bewilderingly rapid 
change of scene ; so that many of Herr Wedekind's 
plays resemble, in the shortness of the segments into 



which they are cut, the breathless and harrowing 
tales serially told in the cheap daily newspaper. 
Details of the realistic effects aimed at (and often 
hit) at the " Chamber Theatre " are given by Mr. 
C. Valentine Williams in " The Contemporary Re- 
view." The very rising of the curtain is attended 
with solemn ceremony. First a gong is sounded 
somewhere at the back of the stage, — one heavy, 
booming note. The attendants glide noiselessly to 
the doors and close them ; the lights are slowly 
dimmed till darkness is produced; then the gong 
sounds again, and with a soft rustle the green silk 
curtains divide, the drop rises, and the play begins. 
As the faintest ray of daylight would spoil the per- 
fect illusion, there are no matinees at the " Kam- 
merspielhaus "; and, moreover, calls before the cur- 
tain are forbidden, lest the charm should be broken. 
Besides Wedekind, Ibsen and Maeterlinck are 
played at this theatre. " Ghosts " is said to have 
been presented with a faithfulness of detail, a per- 
fection of acting, and a ruthlessness of subtle finesse, 
that were positively wrenching. On the whole, the 
reported plans and purposes of this Berlin enter- 
prise had raised hopes of rather better and worthier 
things than are now described by eye-witnesses. 
But the stage rarely rises to a level higher than the 
public on which it 'depends for support. The 
" Chamber Theatre " is unendowed, its managers 
are human, they have their bills to pay, — so what 
could one expect? , , , 

Dante in Omarian quatrains would have at 
least, amid the countless translations of the Divina 
Commedia, the quality of novelty. The Rev. Dr. 
William Wilberforce Newton is said to be now en- 
gaged upon a new version of the poem, wherein he 
makes use of the four-line stanza rendered so fa- 
miliar to all the world by FitzGerald and his imita- 
tors and parodists. Not the entire poem, however, 
is to be thus rendered, considerable portions being 
modelled somewhat after the plan of the Greek 
chorus. Will it be possible to read any of Dante's 
lines in the metre of Omar and still feel that one is 
reading Dante ? Take, for instance, the very open- 
ing stanzas, which Dr. Newton has thus turned into 
English : 

" Dark was the wood and devious was the way 
When in life's journey towards the close of day, 

Midmost twixt youth and age, a stubborn path 
Beguiled ray feet that were not used to stray. 

" How hard a thing in truth it is to tell 
The rough and cruel steps I took ! The spell 

Of terror worse than death which o'er me hung 
The while I loitered in this wooded dell. 

" Ah ! hitter was that fear, enmeshed with Fate ! 
E'en Death itself seemed like a kindlier state. 

Yet what I saw when from the light I turned, 
And all the good I found, I will relate." 

There is much that is novel in Dr. Newton's plan 
of an English Dante, and we hope he will see fit to 
publish his work — the occupation and recreation 
of many leisure hours ; but the feeling that he is in 



284

some sense infringing on FitzGerald's patent must 
be more or less present with his readers. Such, at 
any rate, has been our feeling in reading the few 
excerpts which have come to our notice. 

• • • 

The army of unemployed or would-be 
NOVELISTS responded nobly to the hundred-guinea 
prixe lately offered by Mr. Fisher Unwin, the Lon- 
don publisher, for the best first novel (first by its 
author) submitted to him. This offer is said to 
have brought forth a stream of type-written matter 
estimated at eighteen miles in length — a result at 
once pitiful, pathetic, and amusing. Excepting a 
small fraction of a furlong, all those miles of inno- 
cent white paper, bescribbled with comedies and 
tragedies, with heroisms and villainies, with plots 
and counterplots, were to no purpose, except possi- 
bly to teach the deceitfulness of human hopes. The 
fortunate fraction, entitled " The Woman and the 
Sword," is from the pen of one Rupert Lorraine, 
who, by his coy reluctance to grant the publisher a 
personal interview, and by other marks of shyness, 
excites one's suspicions that " Rupert Lorraine " 
(happy commingling of Unguals and dentals, with 
one labial to give snap to the whole) may be a 
pseudonym, and also that the modestly shrinking 
Rapert may be a woman. The story, however, 
whatever its authorship, is to be published very 
soon, and is to be made the basis of still further 
prize offers, — for the best telegraphic criticism, not 
exceeding twelve words, of its merits (and de- 
fects?), for the best limerick inspired by its pages, 
and for the best imaginary portrait of the reticent 
Rupert. . . . 

MiscORRECTiONS OF MISQUOTATIONS are Some- 
times amusing ; but there is one in the October 
number of "The Author" that surprises and puz- 
zles more than it amuses. A correspondent, appar- 
ently well-read and not unused to handling a pen, 
takes issue with " C. K. S." (even cis- Atlantic read- 
ers will recognize who is meant) on the literary 
ethics involved in a recent case in the English 
courts, and shows his approval of the court's decis- 
ion that literary work should not be liable to "re- 
hash on the part of irresponsible editors." The 
writer then adds : " But the many lovers of Fitz- 
gerald must have squirmed at so hideous a misquo- 
tation as fell from the lips of the great litUrateur 
during the progress of the case. . . . ' Ah, take the 
cash in hand, and let the credit go,' ' C. K. S.' was 
reported to have said, which does not so correctly 
interpret his attitude towards literary work as what 
Fitzgerald really wrote : ' Ah, take the cash in 
hand, and waive the rest.' " If this last is a vari- 
ant reading of the third line of FitzGerald's thir- 
teenth quatrain, it is certainly an unfamiliar one. 
This volunteered correction from one signing him- 
self " Omar," together with the incorrect form of 
FitzGerald's name, makes one wonder whether 
the Tent-maker and his English translator are al- 
ready falling into oblivion in England. 



An English reader of The Dial seems 
angered by the examples of misquoted poetry 
taken from a prominent London weekly and printed 
in a recent issue, and he retorts, with little logic and 
no signature, that the locution " from whence," 
which appears in the same paragraph, is "ignorant 
usage " such as " a third form schoolboy would be 
flogged " if guilty of. The schoolboy might offer 
in defense that the phrase appears in the works of 
standard English authors, and that the International 
Dictionary says of it: "jPVom whence is fully 
authorized by good usage." But this would prob- 
ably increase, rather than allay, the anger of our 
pleonastic friend.

DID ST. PETER "PETER OUT"? 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Li your latest issue is a discussion of the source of the 
expression " peter out." The dictionaries throw no light 
on the subject. Perhaps that is because the etymology 
of the phrase is so obvious, particularly to anybody who 
has a tolerable familiarity with the Bible. You will 
remember that Peter denied Christ. He " Petered out " 
in the most shameful way at a critical time in the life of 
the great teacher. There is no chance for the learning 
of the scholars in this matter. The thing is obvious on

THE ORIGIN OF "PETER OUT." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In the matter of " peter-out," passing the almost too 
obvious suggestion of Peter's weakness at the trial of 
Jesus, for this recent phrase we seek a modern origin. 
Peter was a fisherman; hence he was early taken as the 
patron saint of that craft. The guild of Fishmongers 
in London has the cross-keys of St. Peter in its armorial 
bearings. It is not strange, then, if Peter and fish are 
often found together in phrase and fable. The haddock 
is named in France morue de Saint Pierre, bearing on 
his shoulders two dark spots that show where the saint 
pinched him when he took the tribute coin from his 
mouth ; and elsewhere the " John-dory " is a peterjish 
with the same tradition. Huntmg for an etymology in 
a Danish dictionary, I ran upon the singular fact that a 
" Peterman " is a fisherman ; and HalUwell, Wright, and 
Hotten say the same thing; but Hotten limits this use 
of the word at the present time to Gravesend on the 
Thames. 

A " peterboat " is defined in the Standard Dictionary 
as a fishing-boat pointed alike at both ends; also, a 
crate to float in the water and keep fish alive : said to 
be a " local U. S. usage." The Webster International 
does better: " A peterboat is a fishing-boat sharp at both 
ends." Halliwell (Arch, and Prov. Engl., edit. 1855) 
says, " A boat which is built sharp at each end and can 
therefore be moved either way." He calls it a Suffolk 
word, from the east coast of England. Wright agrees 
on this. But hear Admiral W. H. Smyth of the Royal 
Navy (of whose many books see Allibone) : " Peterboat

a fishing-boat of the Thames and Medway, so named 
for St. Peter, the patron of fishermen. , . . These boats 
were first brought from Norway and the Baltic. They 
are generally short, shallow, sharp at both ends, with 
a well for fish in the centre [here is the Standard's 
crate], 225 feet over all, and six feet beam " (Sailors' 
Wordbook, 1867, s. v.). Notice that all these definitions 
put stress on the sharpness of the ends of the boat. 
Here then is the original of " peter-out," to grow small 
or thin. 

Hotten (Slang Dictionary, 1865) defines the verb, 
" to peter, to run short or give out." Bartlett (Dictionary 
of Americanisms, edit. 1877) says, " To peter out, to 
exhaust, to run out." He quotes two examples, — from 
the Boston Post, 1876, " the mines were petered out," 
making the verb passive, or like is gone, is fallen- 

from the N. Y. Tribune, " the influence of the Hon. 

seems to have quite petered out." 

But I first heard " peter-out " nearly twenty years 
earlier, in 1858, from a New Hampshire man. He had 
been on a farm, and later in a printing-office in Dover, 
a river city ; still later he was among the lumbermen of 
Minnesota. The word in his mind had no relation to 
mining. This fact, and Hotten's definition in 1865, 
prove that the Standard Dictionary certainly errs in 
defining the word as primarily a mining term. It says : 
" In mining, to thin out, become exhausted : said of a 
vein or seam : and used with out : colloquially extended 
to anything that fails, or loses its power, efficiency, or 
value." On the contrary, the phrase was extended to 
mining from its wider sense. The definition in the 
Webster International is correct, but is plainly made up 
from Bartlett; and it is erroneously marked " Slang, 
U. S." But I have shown that it is English in origin. 
Aspeterboat preceded peter out, I am warranted in deriv- 
ing the verb from the tapering shape of the boat, thin 
and sharp. 

There are two other verbs that I should notice: (1) 
peter, to act the Peter Funk at an auction, making fic- 
titious bids; this is purely American; (2) the English 
pether (Wright, Prov. Diet., and Halliwell), "to run; to 
ram; to do anything quickly or in a hurry." This is 
in use in America ; for instance, " I 'm gwine to peter 
down to Washington" (Chicago Evening Post, 1871).

notice that four of the errors are caused by the sub-

stanza, which is thus incorrectly quoted. That is, four 
of the seven words that are wrong are really Long-

of our branch librarians recently reported to me as 
having been read by a worker in the Wolverine Brass 
Works in this city. It is the purpose of this enter- 
prising workingman to take up the history of all the

" Conquest of Mexico," "Conquest of Peru "; Donnelly, 
"Atlantis"; Young, "Rome"; Hudson, " Greece"; Okey, 
" Story of Venice "; Crawford, " Salve Venetia "; Myers, 
" General History "; Breasted, " History of Egypt."

THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNIVERSITY 

OF ILLINOIS. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Enclosed please find a communication which is called 
forth by an article lately appearing in the public press, 
attacking the administration of the University of Illinois. 
The Senate of this University consists of the whole body 
of full professors, and may be presumed to voice the 
University sentiment in any matter it takes action about. 
It will be seen that this body has adopted an absolutely 
unqualified vote of confidence in the President of the 
University and his administration of University affairs. 
If you will kindly give this communication a place in 
your columns, you will confer a favor on the Faculty of 
the University of Illinois. Arthur H. Daniels, 

Professor of Philosophy, Secretary of the Senate. 

Urbana, Illinois, October 16, 1908. 

At a meeting of the Senate of the University of Illinois, 
held Thursday afternoon, October 15, the following resolu- 
tions were adopted : 

Whereas, There is ground for apprehending that recent 
articles in the press may lead the public to think that 
academic freedom is suppressed or interfered with at the 
University of Illinois by the President, or that tenure of 
office is insecure because of autocratic administration ; there- 
fore, without entering at all into a discussion of the case 
referred to in said article, be it 

Resolved, By the Senate of the University of Illinois 
(a body which includes all heads of departments and full 
professors in the University), that it is our belief that each 
member of the faculty has entire freedom of opinion ; that 
he is free to express his opinions on all matters of University 
administration and educational policy to his colleagues and 
to the President without interference and without fear that 
it will endanger his position. 

Resolved, That we hereby express our confidence in the 
President of the University and our conviction that he admin- 
isters his high office as a colleague rather than as a superior. 

Resolved, That in the opinion of the University Senate the 
course of the administration has been such as to stimulate 
to a marked degree the higher scientific and educational 
interests of the University. 

Resolved, That as members of the faculty we assure the 
President of our loyal and hearty support in the varied and 
difficult responsibilities imposed upon him as the executive 
head of this University.

Few books of exploration have commanded 
so wide an interest, on the part of such varied 
classes of readers, as Mr. Dillon Wallace's 
" The Lure of the Labrador Wild " and " The 
Long Labrador Trail." In the formiir, Mr. 
Wallace told of the unsuccessful attempt, in 
1903, of Leonidas Hubbard, Jr., himself and an 
Indian guide named George Elson, to traverse 
the interior of Labrador northward. Starvation 
was Hubbard's fate ; Wallace narrowly escaped 
the same death after struggling heroically to 
save his leader and comrade ; the Indian guide, 
with centuries of endurance as his heritage, suc- 
ceeded in reaching a settlement and sending aid 
— in time for Wallace, too late for Hubbard. 
In the second book Wallace related his success- 
ful attempt (two years later), inspired by the 
example of his friend, to accomplish the task 
that Hubbard had undertaken. 

It would be curious to appraise at their true 
value the elements of these narratives which 
have led to their wide circulation. In point of 
scientific value, neither can be compared with 
scores of travel books — notably, recent vol- 
umes of Arctic exploration. Probably the true 
reasons for the far-spread interest they awak- 
ened were, first, their appeal to the average, 
active, out-of-doors sort of man as the narrative 
of an adventure within the range of his own 
foresight, fortitude, and strength ; and, second, 
the tense dramatic style of the narrator, and 
the intimate, elemental and deeply tragic events 
of the first book, and to a lesser degree of the 
second. 

Now, Mrs. Leonidas Hubbard, Jr., gives us 
the narrative of her own successful effort to 
complete her husband's unfinished work in order 
that his name " should reap the fruits of service 
which had cost him so much." To the story of 
her journey she appends the diary of her hus- 
band from the outset of his trip to the time he 
fell asleep forever, and the narrative of George 
Elson, his guide, covering his own experiences 
on that first fatal trip. The book is very fully 
illustrated ; there are excellent portraits of Mrs. 
Hubbard and her husband, and a map which 
enables the reader to follow every weary portage, 
every night's camp, and almost every dip of

Mrs. Hubbard started by canoe from the 
Northwest River post, at the head of Groswater 
Bay, June 27, 1905 (not July 27, as an inex- 
cusable typographical error on page 24 would 
have us believe). Her companions were four in 
number — Elson, who had been her husband's 
guide ; Joseph Iserhoff , a Russian half-breed ; 
Job Chapies, a pure-blood Cree Indian ; and 
Gilbert Blake, a half-breed Eskimo boy trap- 
per, — the last, unlike the others, a resident of 
Labrador. Her outfit included two canvas- 
covered canoes, nineteen feet long, thirteen 
inches deep, and thirty-four inches wide, and 
with each of them three paddles and a sponge. 
The remainder of the outfit consisted of two 
balloon-silk tents, one stove, seven water-proof 
canvas bags, one dozen ten -pound waterproof 
balloon-silk bags, three tarpaulins, 392 pounds 
of flour, four pounds of baking powder, fifteen 
pounds of rice, twenty cans of standard emer- 
gency rations, twelve pounds of tea, twelve 
pounds of chocolate, sixty pounds of sugar, 
twenty pounds of erbswurst, one ounce of crys- 
talose, four cans of condensed milk, four cans of 
condensed soup, four pounds of hard-tack, two 
hundred pounds of bacon, fourteen pounds of 
salt. She had also kitchen utensils, three small 
axes, one crooked knife, and two nets. The 
firearms were two rifles — a 45-70 with sixty 
rounds of ammunition, and a 38—55 with a hun- 
dred rounds. Each of the men had a 22 calibre 
single-shot pistol for small game, a pair of light 
wool camp-blankets, and an extra pair of " shoe- 
packs." Mrs. Hubbard was, of course- provided 
with a revolver, fishing-tackle, kodaks, films, a 
sextant, and an artificial horizon. With naive 
femininity she says : 

" I wore a short skirt over knickerbockers, a short 
sweater, and a belt. . . . My hat was a rather narrow 
brimmed soft felt. I had one pair of heavy leather moc- 
casins reaching almost to my knees, one pair of high 
sealskin boots, one pair low ones, and three pairs of 
duffel. Of underwear I had four suits and five pairs of 
stockings, all wool. I took also a rubber automobile 
shirt, a long Swedish dog-skin coat, one pair leather 
gloves, one pair woolen gloves, and a blouse — for 
Sundays. For my tent, I had an air mattress, crib-size, 
one pair light camp blankets, one light wool comfortable 
weighmg 3i lbs., one little feather pillow, and a hot- 
water bottle." 

From Grand Lake Mrs. Hubbard passed into 
the Nascaupee River without difficulty, but not 
without thoughts of the dreadful error which 
had led her husband's party to pass by its out- 
let and enter the fatal Susan River, five miles 
beyond. By canoe and portage she followed the

northwesterly course of the Nascaupee, leaving 
it only for the long portage to Seal Lake, which 
she reached in three weeks, the distance covered 
being a hundred and fifteen miles. From Seal 
Lake the Nascaupee River carried her westerly 
to Lake Michikamau — Lake Michikamau, 
which her husband had been destined to see, 
but never to reach, ere he turned discouraged 
backward for the desperate struggle to reach 
the coast before winter. Through Michikamau 
her route was northward again to Lake Michi- 
kamats, and thence by a chain of small lakes to 
the very source of the Nascaupee and the George 
River, the height of land from which she would 
thenceforth travel downward instead of upward, 
though northward still, her hopes and fears now 
centred on reaching Ungava Bay. She had now 
travelled three hundred miles. Her journey 
had been one of compelling interest; she had 
found Labrador beautiful, " with a strange, wild 
beauty, the remembrance of which buries itself 
silently in the deep parts of one's being." In 
the beginning, she says, there had been no 
response to it in her heart ; but gradually, in 
its silent way, it had won, " and now was like 
the strength-giving presence of an understand- 
ing friend." She had not experienced hardship. 
Weariness and discomfort she had met with de- 
termined good-humor and optimism. 

The northward descent, the second half of 
the journey, was made on the George River, and 
the descriptions of its rapids are among the best 
in the book. Near one of the lakes of the 
upper George, Mrs. Hubbard had the good for- 
tune to witness the migration of the caribou, 
which she thus describes : 

" We pushed on, keeping close to the west shore of 
the lake. Little more than a mile further up, the men 
caught sight of deer feeding not far from the water's 
edge. We landed, and climbing to the top of the rock 
wall saw a herd of fifteen or more feeding in the swamp. 
I watched them almost breathless. They were very 
beautiful, and it was an altogether new and delightful 
experience to me. Soon they saw us, and trotted off 
into the bush, though without sign of any great alarm ! 
Greorge and Job made off across the swamp to investigate, 
and not long after returned, their eyes blazing with excite- 
ment, to say that there were hundreds of them not far 
away. Slipping hurriedly back into the canoes, we 
paddled rapidly and silently to near the edge of the 
swamp. Beyond it was a barren hill, which from near 
its foot sloped more gradually to the water. Along this 
bank, where this lower slope dropped to the swamp, lay 
a number of stags, with antlers so immense that I won- 
dered how they could possibly carry them. Beyond, 
the lower slope of the hill seemed to be a solid mass of 
caribou, while its steeper part was dotted over with 
many feeding on the luxuriant moss. 

" Those lying along the bank got up at sight of us, 
and withdrew toward the great herd in rather leisurely 



manner, stopping now and then to watch us curiously. 
When the herd was reached, and the alarm given, the 
stags lined themselves up in the front rank and stood 
facing us, with heads high, and a rather defiant air. It 
was a magnificent sight. They were in summer garb of 
pretty brown, shading to light grey and white on the 
under parts. The horns were in velvet, and those of the 
stags seemed as if they must surely weigh down the 
heads on which they rested. It was a mixed company, 
for male and female were already herding together. 
I started toward the herd, kodak in hand, accompanied 
by George, while the others remained at the shore. The 
splendid creatures seemed to grow taller as we ap- 
proached, and when we were within two hundred and 
fifty yards of them their defiance took definite form, and 
with determined step they came toward us. 

" The sight of that advancing army under such leader- 
ship was decidedly impressive, recalling vivid mental 
pictures made by tales of the stampeding wild cattle in 
the west. It made one feel like getting back to the 
canoe and that is what we did. . . . We and the caribou 
stood watching each other for some time ! Then the 
caribou began to rim from either extreme of the herd, 
some round the south end of the hill, and the others 
away to the north, the line of stags still maintaining their 
position. ... A short paddle carried us round the point 
. . . and there we saw them swimming across the lake. 
Three quarters of a mile out was an island, a barren 
ridge, standing out of the water, and from mainland to 
island they formed as they swam an unbroken bridge; 
from the farther end of which they poured in steady 
stream over the hill-top, their flying forms clearly out- 
lined against the sky. How long we watched them I 
could not say, for I was too excited to take any note of 
time ; but finally the main body had passed. Yet when 
we landed above the point from which they had crossed, 
companies of them, eight, ten, fifteen, twenty in a herd, 
were to be seen in all directions. . . . The country was 
literally alive with the beautiful creatures and they did 
not seem to be much frightened. They apparently 
wanted only to keep what seemed to them a safe distance 
between us, and woidd stop to watch us curiously within 
easy rifle shot. Yet I am glad that I can record that 
not a shot was fired at them. Gilbert was wild, for he 
had in him the hunter's instinct in fullest measure. The 
trigger of Job's rifle clicked longingly, but they never 
forgot that starvation broods over Labrador, and that 
the animal they longed to shoot might some time save 
the life of one in just such extremity as that reached by 
Mr. Hubbard and his party two years before. . . . For 
fifty miles of our journey beyond this point we saw com- 
panies of caribou every day, and sometimes many times 
a day, though we did not again see them in such numbers. 
The country was a net-work of their trails, in the wood- 
lands and bogs cut deep into the soft soil, on the barren 
hillsides, broad dark bands converging to the crossing 
place at the river." 

The caribou seem to have been on their way to 
the highlands between the George River and the 
Atlantic. Mrs. Hubbard believes herself the 
first person to have witnessed the migration of 
the great herd, save the Indians, who slaughter 
the caribou in great numbers during this period. 
It was the expectation of the party to find the 
Nascaupee Indians and secure from them some 
information as to the character of the George

River whose waters they must now traverse to 
their journey's end. The guides were appre- 
hensive. 

« Turning to me, George remarked, * You are giving 
that revolver a fine rubbing up to-night.' 

" ' Yes,' I replied, laughing a little, ' I am getting 
ready for the Nascaupees.' 

" ' They would not shoot you,' he said gravely. ' It 
woidd be us they would kill if they took the notion. 
Whatever their conjuror tells them to do, they will do.' 

" ' No,' asserted Gilbert, ' they would not kill you, 
Mrs. Hubbard. It would be to keep you at their camp 
that they would kill us.' 

" I had been laughing at George a little, but Gilbert's 
startling announcement induced a sudden sobriety. As 
I glanced from one to the other, the faces of the men 
were all unwontedly serious. There was a whirl of 
thoughts for a moment, and then I asked, ' What do 
you think I shall be doing while they ai-e killing you? 
You do not need to think that because I will not kill 
rabbits, or ptarmigan, or caribou, I should have any 
objection to kiUing a Nascaupee Indian if it were neces- 
sary.' Nevertheless, the meetmg with the Indians had 
for me assumed a new and more serious aspect, and, 
remembering their agony of fear lest some harm befall 
me ere we reached civilization again, I reaUzed how the 
situation seemed to the men. When I went to my tent 
it was to lie very wide awake, turning over in my mind 
plans of battle in case the red men proved aggressive." 

The meeting with the Nascaupee Indians 
proved, however, to be one of the most agree- 
able incidents of the trip. The first inquiry 
of the Indians was for tobacco, and then hands 
were extended in greeting. In broken English, 
but with expressive gestures, the Indians in- 
formed them of the distance and course yet to 
be travelled. An arm held at an angle showed 
the rapids to be expected, and a vigorous drop 
of the hand indicated the faUs. Best of all was 
the assurance that if they travelled fast they 
would sleep but five times before reaching the 
post at Ungava. This meant that Mrs. Hubbard 
would arrive in time to secure passage on the 
last steamer leaving before the long Labrador 
winter set in. The Indians were hospitable, 
but no gallantries were attempted except a very 
diplomatic and indirect effort on the part of one 
young brave to make an impression on the fair 
visitor. 

" One of the yoimg men, handsomer than the others, 
and conscious of the fact, had been watching me through- 
out with evident interest. He was not only handsomer 
but his leggings were redder. As we walked up toward 
the camp he went a little ahead, and to one side. A 
little distance from where we landed was a row of bark 
canoes turned upside down. As we passed them he 
turned, and, to make sure that those red leggings should 
not fail of their mission, he put his foot up on one of the 
canoes, pretending, as I passed, to tie his moccasin, the 
while watching for the effect." 

From the Nascaupee camp the George River 
was an almost continuous course of rapids. 



There were stretches, miles in length, when the 
slope of the river was a steep gradient, and Mrs. 
Hubbard held her breath as the canoe shot down 
at toboggan speed. There was not only the slope 
down, but a distinct tilt from one side to the 
other of the river could be observed. Even when 
the water was smooth and apparently motionless 
(though actually tremendously swift) the slope 
downward was clearly marked. 

" But more weird and uncanny than wildest cascade 
or rapid was the dark vision which opened out before us 
at the head of Slanting Lake. The picture in my memory 
still seems unreal and mysterious, but the actual one was 
as disturbing as an evil dream. Down, down, down the 
long slope before us stretched the lake and river, black 
as ink under leaden sky and shadowing hills. The lake, 
which was three-quarters of a mile wide, dipped not only 
with the course of the river but appeared to dip also 
from one side to the other. Not a ripple or touch of 
white could be scan anywhere. All seemed motionless 
as if an unseen hand had touched and stilled it. A death- 
like quiet reigned and as we glided smoothly down with 
the tide we could see all about us a soft, boiling motion 
at the surface of this black flood which gave the sense 
of treachery as well as mystery." 

The travelling day was a short one during 
this part of the trip ; the strain on the men was 
too intolerable to be borne for many hours. The 
nights were made hideous by the mosquitoes. 
The flies had nearly driven Mrs. Hubbard to 
distraction at an earlier period of the journey. 
Even a heavy veil, of several thicknesses, was 
insufficient protection. 

And so they raced down to the bay and found 
they had arrived ahead of the ship whose depar- 
ture without them they had feared so strongly. 
Summing up, they found they had travelled 576 
miles from post to post ; the trip occupied forty- 
three days of actual travelling, eighteen days in 
camp. They had started with 750 pounds of 
provisions, 392 of which was flour ; their surplus 
was 150 pounds, of which 105 pounds was flour. 
The results claimed by Mrs. Hubbard for her 
journey are pioneer maps of the Nascaupee and 
George Rivers, that of the Nascaupee showing 
Seal Lake and Lake Michikamau to be in the 
same drainage basin — proof that the Northwest 
and Nascaupee are not two distinct rivers, but 
one, the outlet of Lake Michikamau ; some notes 
by the way on the topography, geology, flora and 
fauna of the country traversed. 

From her own experience Mrs. Hubbard con- 
cludes that had the season in which her husband 
made the journey, one of unprecedented sever- 
ity, been the more normal one in which her own 
trip was made, he would have returned safe and 
triumphant, despite his failure to find the open 
waterway to Lake Michikamau. His outfit and

provisions, she believes, would have been ample 
under normal conditions ; but she reminds those 
who have criticized him for lack of foresight in 
planning his outfit, that he did not plan it him- 
self. 

Mrs. Hubbard's story occupies about two 
hundred pages. The remaining hundred pages 
are made up of a partial transcript of her 
husband's diary, and the narrative of Elson, 
the guide, with reference to the first expedition. 
The Hubbard diary is, for the most part, written 
in short phrases from which unnecessary words 
are omitted, — notes, evidently, for the story he 
meant to write at the conclusion of his jour- 
ney, the story finally written by another hand. 
Here are his last written words : 

" My tent is pitched in open tent style in front of a 
big rock. The rock reflects the fire, but now it is going 
out because of the rain. I think I shall let it go and 
close the tent, till the rain is over, thus keeping out 
rain and saving wood. Tonight or tomorrow perhaps 
the weather will improve so I can build a fire, eat the 
rest of my moccasins, and have some bone broth. Then 
I can boil my belt and oil tanned moccasins and a pair 
of cow-hide mittens. They ought to help some. I am 
not suffering. The acute pangs of hunger have given 
way to indifference. I am sleepy. I think death from 
starvation is not so bad. But let no one suppose that I 
expect it. I am prepared, that is all. I think the boys 
will be able, with the Lord's help, to save me." 

The latter half of the diary is perhaps as vivid 
a description of human suffering as ever was 
given to the world to read. 

Elson "s diary contains an iinbelievable state- 
ment with regard to Wallace — that for the 
sake of recovering the much-used and probably 
broken-in canoe he would have had Elson re- 
turn to the wilderness soon after Hubbard's 
body had been recovered. Aside from this, 
the Elson diary is most interesting, and in its 
own way supplements the earlier narratives. 

Mrs. Hubbard has accomplished a hazardous 
undertaking, requiring such courage and endur- 
ance as only a woman of rare character would 
have possessed. Her book should command a 
wide circle of interested readers. It is to be 
regretted, however, that her account lacks both 
definiteness and good form in its presentation ; 
there are hopeless and involved anti-climaxes 
when striking situations afforded opportunities 
for quite the opposite effects. One reader, at 
least, has been pained by the evident deprecia- 
tion, throughout her book, of Wallace's services 
to her husband and loyalty to his memory, as 
evidenced in the earlier books and by Hubbard's 
own diary. Private differences, if there be such, 
should not have led Mrs. Hubbard to set down 
aught in malice. By inference, she clearly gives 



all the credit for the heroic effort to save her 
husband's life to Elson ; to him belongs the praise 
for heroism almost beyond belief. But it should 
be remembered that when, after finding the dis- 
carded flour, it was Elson 's duty to seek his way 
out of the wilderness ; he knew that every step 
he took, painful and desperate as his condition 
was, took him nearer to light and warmth and 
food and the friends he was to send back to the 
rescue. But Wallace shouldered his sack of 
mouldy flour, bade farewell to Elson, and turned 
his face resolutely back again toward the wilder- 
ness — toward that tent in the very valley of the 
shadow of death ; back to find, if he could, the 
dying man to whom he carried food, there per- 
haps to die with him ere the rescuers came. He 
is not the less a hero that he failed, — and he 
did not sink down in despair until he had gone 
the full distance back to the tent, and beyond 
it, missing it with his blinded eyes, still strug- 
gling with naked frozen feet through the snow 
to find his friend. They were all three heroic 
in their courage and devotion to each other, 
their patience and their hopefulness. But there 
were three heroes, not two, — and the number 
of them should not be lessened as the tale is told.

The Tragedy of Korea.* 



To the already imposing literature of protest 
which the passing of Korean independence has 
called forth in three short years, a fresh and 
noteworthy addition has recently been made in 
a volume by Mr. McKenzie, English traveller 
and journalist, under the title of " The Tragedy 
of Korea." Of distinct merits, the book posses- 
ses not a few. For one thing, it is not unduly 
ambitious ; and for a book of its class that is 
saying a good deal. It makes no attempt to 
attack and despatch all things Oriental, past, 
present, and future. Its scope is definite and 
its treatment concise. If at first glance it appears 
a slight piece of work, it will be found a more 
satisfying book than the majority of its kind, 
and the jaded reader should be thankful for its 
lack of the customary journalistic " dead mat- 
ter." In the second place, the book is the work 
of a man who has been long upon the ground 
and who writes entirely from observation or 
other first-hand sources of information. And 
in the third place, though obviously intended as 
an arraignment of Japan for her recent course

in Korea, the volume comes from the pen of an 
Englishman who was until recently an ardent 
admirer of the Japanese, and who, reluctantly 
brought by events to a change of sentiment, is 
as fair-minded and conservative in his judgments 
as any writer upon so vexed a subject can well be. 
Approximately, the first third of the volume 
is taken up with a running sketch of the opening 
of Korea, from the ill-fated visit of the American 
schooner " General Sherman " in 1866 and the 
conclusion of the first Japanese-Korean treaty in 
1876 to the outbreak of the recent Russo- 
Japanese war. The Korean aspects of the Chino- 
Japanese war and of the treaty of Shimonoseki, 
together with the striking events following the 
murder of the Korean queen in 1895, are 
described in an unusually intelligible manner. 
Then follows a careful account of the period 
from 1895 to the Russo-Japanese war and the 
treaty of Portsmouth. The inevitableness of the 
conflict is clearly brought out, together with the 
reasons why such a war was certain to be epochal 
in the history of the Korean peninsula. 

The body of the book, however, is devoted to 
the brief period since the Peace of Portsmouth, 
and more particularly to the operations of the 
Japanese in the Hermit Kingdom since that 
date. Mr. McKenzie has been in Korea con- 
tinuously during these years, and has had under 
his eye the methods and processes by which the 
influence of Japan has been made all-pervasive 
and all-powerful among the Korean people. In 
a succession of vivid chapters he sets forth 
a melancholy record of devastation, plunder, 
cruelty, and ruin, wrought by Japanese troops 
and officials throughout the peninsula in course 
of the work of "pacification." Describing a 
horseback observation trip in the vicinity of 
I-Chhon, he writes as foUows : 

" We rode on through village after village and ham- 
let after hamlet burned to the groimd. The very atti- 
tude of the people told me that the hand of Japan had 
struck hard there. We would come upon a boy carrying 
a load of wood. He would run quickly to the side of 
the road when he saw us, expecting he knew not what. 
We passed a village with a few houses left. The women 
flew to shelter as I drew near. Some of the stories that 
I heard later helped me to judge why they should run. 
Of course they took me for a Japanese. All along the 
route I heard tales of the Japanese plundering, where 
they had not destroyed. Here the village elders would 
bring me an old man badly beaten by a Japanese soldier 
because he resisted being robbed. Then came darker 
stories. In Seoul I had laughed at them. Now, face 
to face with the victims, I could laugh no more. That 
afternoon we rode into I-Chhon itself. This is quite a 
large town. I found it practically deserted. Most of 
the people had fled to the hills to escape the Japanese. 
I slept that night in a school-house, now deserted and 



unused. There were the cartoons and animal pictures 
and pious mottoes around, but the children were far 
away. I passed through the market-place, usually a 
very busy spot. There was no sign of life there. I 
turned to some of the Koreans. * Where are your 
women ? Where are your children ? ' I demanded. 
They pointed to the high and barren hills looming 
against the distant heavens. ' They are up there,' they 
said. ' Better for them to lie on the barren hill-sides 
than to be outraged here.' " 

And so the mournful story goes, chapter after 
chapter. Allowing as much as one may for 
possible over-drawing, it is still plain that we 
have here a record of bloodshed and ruin which 
challenges the attention of the civilized world. 
In a very interesting chapter on " The Suppres- 
sion of Foreign Criticism," the author considers 
the natural query as to why the Europeans and 
Americans resident in Korea did not make known 
the full facts about the Japanese administration 
at an earlier date. " Some of them did attempt 
it," he asserts, " but the strong feeling that 
generally existed abroad in favor of the Japanese 
people — a feeling due to the magnificent con- 
duct of the nation during the war — caused com- 
plaints to go unheeded." And he declares that 
scores like himself, alienated by the mistakes 
and follies of Russia's Far Eastern policies and 
favorably impressed by the qualities of the 
Japanese which caught the fancy of the whole 
world, looked on for a long time in silence, 
unwilling to believe anything but the best of 
the sturdy antagonists of the Muscovite. Per- 
haps the most interesting portion of the whole 
book is the account of the journalistic rivalries 
of the pro-Japanese and anti-Japanese parties 
in Seoul, with particular reference to the work 
of Mr. Bethell, the editor of the " Korea Daily 
News." 

Although high officials at Tokio, such as 
Viscount Teranchi, Minister of War and Acting 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, are insistently pro- 
claiming that Japan's programme is not one of 
empire, of conquest, and of war, Mr. McKenzie 
refuses to be convinced. In his concluding 
chapter he contends that the policy of Japan in 
Korea to-day " cannot be fully understood unless 
it is regarded, not as an isolated manifestation, 
but as a part of a great Imperial scheme. ' Japan, 
he asserts, has set out to be a great world-power, 
and she is rapidly realizing her ambition. Else- 
where he declares : 

« I, for one, am convinced that we owe it to ourselves 
and to our ally, Japan, to let it be clearly known that 
a policy of Imperial expansion based upon breaches of 
solemn treaty obligations to a weaker nation, and built 
up by odious cruelty, by needless slaughter, and by a 
wholesale theft of the private property rights of a

dependent and defenceless peasantry, is repugnant to 
our instincts and cannot fail to rob the nation that is 
doing it of much of that respect and goodwill with 
which we all so recently regarded her." 

Mr. McKenzie confesses to a very profound 
respect for the capacities of the Japanese people, 
but it is his belief that in her striving to become 
a world-power the nation is at present over-reach- 
ing herself. Indeed, he is generous enough to 
attribute the Empire's obnoxious Korean policies 
to the grinding economic conditions prevailing 
since the war. " Japan," he says, " has broken 
her solemn promises to Korea, and has evaded 
in every way her pledged obligations to maintain 
the policy of equal opportunities, because she is 
driven thereto by heavy taxation, by the poverty 
of her people, and by the necessity of obtaining 
fresh markets and new lands for settlement." 
But that these are the impelling forces rather 
than mere rampant imperialism, does not help 
matters for Korea. Her lot Mr. McKenzie 
regards as palpably unhappy, and as likely to 
continue so unless Japanese energies shall be 
turned in other directions. Obviously, there 
is a good deal that might be said — a good deal 
that has been said — on the other side. But the 
statements of fact and the assertions of opinion 
which Mr. McKenzie has set down in his little 
book are abundantly worth giving to the world. 
There is an appendix containing a number of 
the essential documents, and there are numer- 
ous excellent illustrations, which are also the 
authors handiwork. But, unfortunately, there 
is no index. Frederic Austin Ogg. 



Canadians of IjOng Ago.* 



In the very readable volume entitled " Cana- 
dian Types of the Old Regime," Professor Colby 
does not profess to have brought forward any 
strikingly new material. His aim is, rather, to 
approach the life of Old Canada by an untried 
route ; to present certain phases of that life in 
a manner that, as he has applied it, is both novel 
and effective. To secure distinctness, in discuss- 
ing various aspects of French colonization in the 
New World, " the examples have been drawn, 
chapter by chapter, from some one career. Or, 
rather, a single personage has been made the 
representative of a class, and in considering the 
large subject with which he is connected, certain 
features of his experience are rendered promin- 
ent. But," the author adds, " this method does

W. Colby. New York : Henry Holt & Co. 



not involve the exact portraiture of individuals, 
nor does it exclude minor figures from the field 
of the discussion." 

The subject is opened by an admirable intro- 
ductory chapter on " The Historical Background 
of New France." Professor Colby points out 
the strong influence of the Renaissance, and of 
the Reformation, upon the colonization of New 
France ; and sketches briefly and skilfully the 
relations of the king, the nobles, the great min- 
isters Richelieu, Mazarin, and Colbert, and the 
Church, respectively, to the colony, as well as 
the effect which the neighboring colonies of New 
England had upon the development of New 
France. In succeeding chapters, he takes up 
the several colonial types one by one. Champ- 
lain is taken as the type of the Explorer, but 
not entirely to the exclusion of the other famous 
pathfinders of Old Canada, such as La Salle, 
Marquette, Joliet, and Nicolet. Similarly, Bre- 
beuf is taken as type of the Missionary, the 
personalities of other Jesuit martyrs being 
grouped around that heroic figure of New 
France. Opportunity is found for a discus- 
sion of the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church 
and the Calvinists toward missions, and the rela- 
tions of the several orders, Jesuits, Recollets, 
and Sulpicians, toward New France and each 
other. 

With Louis Hebert as his type of the Col- 
onist, Professor Colby sketches effectively the 
commercial life of Canada under the Old 
Regime, the fur-trade, Richelieu and the Com- 
pany of the Hundred Associates, the exclusion 
of the Huguenots, the seigniorial system and its 
effect upon the habitant the coureur de bois^ 
etc. With D'lberville as a central point, the 
Soldier type of New France is presented. We 
are reminded not only of the romantic exploits 
of D'lberville himself in Hudson Bay and else- 
where — exploits as dramatic and fascinating 
as anything in fiction — but of many other 
incidents of pluck and heroism, the story of 
DoUard's matchless self-sacrifice at the Long 
Sault, the adventures of Fran9ois Hertel, 
Maisonneuve and the Iroquois, Frontenac's 
raids against the British colonies, etc. 

Du Lhut, as type of the coureui' de bois^ 
introduces us to one of the most fascinating 
phases of the life of New France — the fur- 
trader, with his curious blending of commerce 
and romance. Du Lhut's own adventures, his 
relations with La Salle, his rescue of Hennepin 
(most mendacious of historians) from the Sioux, 
are sufficiently interesting ; but they pale before 
the exploits of that matchless adventurer Radis-

son and his brother-in-law Groseilliers. Of the 
remaining chapters, Laval furnishes a type for 
the Bishop ; and the Governor is represented 
by Frontenac. In the final chapter, the author 
brings together a great deal of interesting 
material bearing on the position of Women in 
New France, contrasting the women of France 
and of Canada in the seventeenth century, and 
quoting the entertaining account of the Swedish 
traveller, Peter Kalm. For the rest, we have 
striking word-pictures of some of the more famous 
women of New France — the heroine Madeleine 
de Vercheres, the Duchesse d'Aiguillon and the 
hospital at Quebec, Madame de la Peltrie and 
the Ursulines, Marie de I'lncarnation, Jeanne 
Mance and the hospital at Montreal, Marguerite 
Bourgeoys and the Nuns of the Congregation. 
All this is both informing and entertaining. 
" History," says Professor Colby, " does not 
exist simply for the benefit of the erudite, and 
there are always some to whom a book is recom- 
mended by the absence of specific gravity." No 
one could call this book heavy, and yet even the 
erudite might find much in it that would repay 
perusal. Its foundation, it may be added, is a 
course of lectures originally delivered by Pro- 
fessor Colby before the May Court Club at 
Ottawa, Canada. Lawrence J. Burpee. 



The Spanish Inquisition in History.* 

The last few years have witnessed a remark- 
able activity in the field of American histor- 
iography. Scholars who but recently were 
engaged in monographic investigations appear 
to have developed a sudden desire to work in 
broader fields, to present results already ob- 
tained rather than give all their energies to the 
examination of difficult and disputed problems. 
As a consequence, the historical side of Amer- 
ican literature is developing as never before. 
Abroad, however, if we may judge from the 
scanty notices that some of our best recent 
productions have received in literary journals, 
little attention is being paid to this develop- 
ment. Except in a general way, the European 
student is not interested in American history ; 
and as most of our historical writers are study- 
ing the annals of our own country their work 
does not appeal, as it might, to foreign scholars. 
It is the subject-matter, and not deficiencies in

Lea. In four volumes. New York : The Macmillan Co.

quality, that prevents the American historian 
from receiving merited recognition abroad. 

Still, there is at least one American writer 
of history whose fame is great in Europe — 
greater, perhaps, than in his own country. 
Forty years ago a Philadelphia business man 
began to publish a series of studies in mediaeval 
society which placed him at once in the front 
rank of historical investigators. His first book 
was a collection of essays on the judicial pro- 
cedure of the Middle Ages, to which he gave 
the general title " Superstition and Force." 
Since then. Dr. Lea has continued to explore 
the mysterious borderlands of mediaeval eccle- 
siastical and social history, and has written 
learnedly on such themes as Clerical Celibacy, 
Excommimication, the Mediaeval Inquisition, 
Auricular Confession, the Expulsion of the 
Moors, and kindred subjects. In 1888 ap- 
peared his three- volume " History of the Inquisi- 
tion of the Middle Ages," which a distinguished 
English historical student. Lord Acton, called 
the greatest contribution of the New World to 
the history of the Old World. At the same 
time it was announced that the author was col- 
lecting materials for a study of the later form of 
the Inquisition, that which originated in Spain 
in the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. This 
work has recently appeared, as planned, in four 
volumes of about six hundred pages each. To 
these the author has added a supplementary 
volume, in which he traces the history of the 
Inquisition in the Spanish dependencies. 

Dr. Lea has grouped his materials under nine 
heads, the discussion of each making a book. 
These are, the Origin, Relations with the State, 
Jurisdiction, Organization, Resources, Practice, 
Punishments, Spheres of Action, and the final 
fate of the institution (the conclusion). In the 
supplementary volume the grouping is naturally 
of a geographical rather than of a topical char- 
acter, a chapter being devoted to the Inquisition 
in each of the principal dependencies or each 
group of dependencies. The author does not 
attempt to discuss the Inquisition in the Spanish 
Netherlands, as the necessary documents (now 
being collected by Professor Paid Fredericq) 
are not yet accessible. 

In the popular mind the Inquisition is nearly 
always associated with the efforts to crush out 
the Protestant heresies of the sixteenth century. 
It is true that in many European countries, 
notably in the Netherlands, this tribunal in its 
modem form was vigorously employed for such 
a purpose ; but with its origin Protestantism 
had nothing to do. The Spanish Inquisition

had done great and effective work before the 
German reformer raised his voice against the 
abuses that he thought he had found in the 
Church. That we may understand why this 
terrible institution was called into being, the 
author discusses at some length the political and 
racial situation on the Spanish peninsula at the 
close of the middle ages. He finds that before 
the dawn of the modem era the Spaniards were 
the most tolerant people in Christendom. The 
Jews and the Moors who lived among and about 
them were treated with a kindness that amounted 
to favor. But by the close of the fourteenth cen- 
tury, this most tolerant nation had become the 
most intolerant of all. The common statement 
that the hatred then displayed was an inborn 
pecidiarity of the Spanish race does not satisfy 
Dr. Lea. " Such facts," he tells us, " must 
have their explanations, and it is the business 
of the expositor of history to trace them to their 
causes." The larger part of Book I., more than 
two hundred pages, is devoted to a study of this 
change in the Castilian character and its effect 
on the non-Christian popidation. The change 
is attributed mainly to the constant pressure of 
the Church ; and in support of this conclusion 
the author quotes freely from the anti-Jewish 
legislation of the Church councils and the 
repressive secular ordinances that grew out of 
the demands of the Church. " The Church, in 
its efforts to arouse the popiJar hatred, was 
powerfully aided by the odium which the Jews 
themselves excited through their ostentation, 
their usury, and their functions as public offi- 
cials." This hatred soon showed itself in per- 
secution and bloodshed, especially in the mas- 
sacres of 1391, the history of which is told in 
detail by Dr. Lea. 

This changed attitude of their neighbors 
struck terror into the hearts of the Jewish 
people, and multitudes of that race sought re- 
fuge in baptism. But the Catholic priest soon 
discovered that in many cases the conversion 
was merely a superficial change ; and he trem- 
bled at the thought that a large, wealthy, and 
influential section of his church was infected 
with heresy, which to the mediaeval mind was 
the greatest of all crimes, the vilest of all sins. 
It was to remove this new danger to the faith 
that the Spanish Inquisition was established. 
The statement of the historian Motley that " it 
was originally devised for Jews and Moors," 
and was afterwards " extended from pagans to 
heretics," is clearly an error. Dr. Lea shows 
conclusively that the non-Christians were en- 
tirely beyond the jurisdiction of any ecclesias- 



tical tribunal ; until they became converts the 
Inquisition could not reach them. He also 
rejects the recent belief that the Inquisition 
was " a political engine for the conversion of 
Spain from a mediaeval feudal monarchy to one 
of the modern absolute type." This change 
was effected by other means, especially by the 
employment of the Santa Hermandad^ or 
Holy Brotherhood. It is true, however, that 
the tribunal at times gave valuable aid to the 
cause of absolute monarchy, particularly in the 
colonies, where it was found extremely con- 
venient to treat insurrectionary teachings as 
heresies. 

The author is careful to bring out the differ- 
ence between the earlier Inquisition and the new 
Spanish tribunal. The fact that the latter had 
its own organization, framed its own rules, could 
call aU the forces of the State to its assistance, 
and was subject to no power but the sovereign, 
gave it tremendous opportunities for aggrandize- 
ment, especially when the throne was occcupied 
by a weak monarch. " At times it was the 
instrument of his will ; at others it seemed as 
though it might almost supplant the monarchy ; 
it was constantly seeking to extend its awful 
authority over the other departments of state, 
which struggled with varying success to resist 
its encroachments, while successive kings, auto- 
cratic in theory, sometimes posed as arbitrators, 
sometimes vainly endeavored to enforce their 
pacificatory commands, but more generally 
yielded to its domineering spirit." 

That a tribunal composed of practically irre- 
sponsible judges woidd often exercise its power 
in a tyranical manner, is to be expected ; and 
the author finds that such was too often the 
case. A notable instance is the case of Arch- 
bishop Carranza, which occupied the attention 
of Christendom for seventeen years, and of 
which the author gives a detailed account. In 
this case are illustrated not only the vindictive 
and persecuting spirit of the inquisitorial au- 
thorities, but also their cupidity, their jealousy 
of papal control, and their willingness to serve 
the Spanish monarch. The charge of cruelty 
is considered in the sixth and seventh books, 
which are devoted to practice and punishments. 
Dr. Lea finds that the tribunals of the Holy 
Office often did carry the use of torture to a 
terrible extreme ; but his general conclusion is 
that " the popular impression that the inquisi- 
torial torture-chamber was the scene of excep- 
tional refinement in cruelty, of persistence in 
extorting confessions, is an error due to sensa- 
tional writers who have exploited credulity."

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



The Spanish Inquisition, in the application of 
torture, was less cruel, we are told, than the 
secular courts or the Roman Inquisition. But 
this does not mean that the inquisitorial pro- 
cedure was considerate or mild ; the tribimal 
was determined to gain its ends, and where the 
usual means failed (which they did but rarely) 
the inquisitors had no scruples about the use of 
torture. 

Still, so long as the Inquisition busied itself 
with matters of faith and heresy, the people 
endured without much complaining. And yet. 
Dr. Lea concludes that the Holy Office came 
to be hated and detested " by all classes, — 
laymen and ecclesiastics, noble and simple." 
This hostility resulted from the attempts of the 
inquisitors to interfere in purely secular matters ; 
especially did the people resent their efforts to 
establish commercial monopolies. In a most 
instructive chapter on the Privileges of the Holy 
Office, the author shows how this institution, 
because of its exemption from taxes, tariff dues, 
and the like, was able to comer markets and 
crush competitors almost as effectively as a 
modern trust. Such perversion of spiritual 
authority to secular and often unholy uses 
appears to have become quite common and 
frequent. 

As to the effects of inquisitorial activity on 
national life and progress, the author speaks in 
terms of unqualified condemnation. "It is 
impossible not to conclude that the Inquisition 
paralyzed both the intellectual and the economic 
development of Spain. . . . Material progress 
became impossible, industry languished, and the 
inability to meet foreign competition assisted 
the mistaken internal policy of the government 
in prolonging and intensifying the poverty of the 
people." At the same time he acquits the author- 
ities of intentional guilt in the following striking 
sentences : 

"Yet who can blame Isabella and Torquemada or 
the Hapsburg princes for their share in originating and 
maintaining this disastrous instrument of wrong? The 
Church had taught for centuries that implicit acceptance 
of its dogmas and blind obedience to its commands were 
the only avenues to salvation; that heresy was treason 
to God, its extermination the highest service to God and 
the highest duty to man. This grew to be the universal 
belief, and, when Protestant sects framed their several 
confessions, each one was so supremely confident of pos- 
sessing the secret of the Divine Being and his dealings 
with his creatures that all shared the zeal to serve God 
in the same cruel fashion." 

Dr. Lea's latest history has all the virtues of 
his earlier studies : it is written in clear un- 
adorned English ; the discussion is temperate, 
calm, and judicial ; every statement is fortified 



with documentary proofs ; and the more import- 
ant matters are treated with careful presentation 
of details. At the venerable age of four score 
and three years, the author is apparently as 
strong and keen and vigorous as ever ; and this, 
his latest work, ranks easily with his strongest 
and best. Laurence M. Larson. 



Recent Fiction.* 



A story opening which never fails of its appeal is 
that which pictures a boy born to poverty but hav- 
ing within him the capacity to lift himself above his 
native surroundings and achieve success by his own 
unaided efforts. No one can fail to follow sympa- 
thetically the steps in such a career — particularly 
the early steps — as the boyish soul gradually 
awakens to its predestined heritage and as the years 
of dawning manhood bring the first flush of success 
to the toilsome life. It is such a boy that Miss Mary 
Johnston brings to our attention in the opening 
pages of " Lewis Rand," and her book bears the 
name of her hero. The scene is Virginia, and the 
period is that of the very beginning of the Ameri- 
can Republic, when people still have fresh memories 
of Valley Forge and Yorktown, and when "The 
Federalist" offers a more controversial subject than 
the sacred scriptures. The boy, ignorant and ragged, 
is befriended by no less a personage than Mr. 
Jefferson, then newly entered upon his duties as 
Washington's Secretary of State. The real action 
of the story begins a dozen or more years later, 
when Lewis has become a successful lawyer and Re- 
publican politician, and his patron, firmly seated in 
the Presidential chair, has shown himself no mere 
doctrinaire by the act of statesmanship which with 
a stroke of the pen doubled the area of the United 
States. By this time, we know fairly weU what is 
coming, as far as the external machinery of the 
novel is concerned. Burr's dream of empire fills 
the minds of those who share the vision with him, 
and we regretfully follow our hero, the prey of inor- 
dinate ambition, as he deserts the leader to whom

every tie of gratitude should have kept him bound, 
and plots secret treason against his country. The 
bursting of the bubble saves him from the commis- 
sion of the overt act, and Jefferson, who has held in 
his hands the threads of the conspiracy all the time, 
is magnanimous enough to spare the ingrate from 
public exposure. But a proud and rebellious nature 
of Lewis Rand's type is bound to work its own de- 
struction in some way, and the man who has just 
escaped being a traitor in the open becomes a mur- 
derer in private in a moment of uncontrollable pas- 
sion. His conscience, and the urgency of his high- 
minded wife, finally compel him to make confession, 
and the story closes when he gives himself up to 
justice. Although the curtain then falls, there can 
be but one possible sequel, for the murder was most 
wanton, and the victim a very noble gentleman. 
This sombre outcome is not what we are led to anti- 
cipate in the earlier chapters, and it is something of 
a shock to learn that the admiration due to a Lucifer 
is all that we are permitted for our hero in the end. 
Byron's " Manfred " supplies the words which ex- 
actly fit him. 

" This should have been a noble creature ; he 
Hath all the energy which would have made 
A goodly frame of glorious elements, 
Had they been wisely mingled ; as it is 
It is an awful chaos — light and darkness, 
And mind and dust, and passions and pure thoughts 
Mixed, and contending without end or order." 

But the story is a strong one, richly furnished 
forth with the accessories of historical fact and of 
the manners of Virginians a century ago. It pro- 
vides a vivid presentation of a deeply interesting 
period in our national annals, and it throbs with a 
very real life, albeit a life romantically tinged. 
Miss Johnston is to be warmly congratulated, for 
" Lewis Rand " is a better book than she has here- 
tofore written. 

It is not often that we come upon a novel written 
with the conscious artistic purpose of Mr. 
Lewisohn's "The Broken Snare," in which the 
imperative demands of technique — both verbal 
and architectonic — are never ignored, and which yet 
has no lack of rich human substance. The author 
has taken Flaubert for his model, and has shown 
himself a not unworthy disciple of the master. 
More than most works of fiction, this is the story 
of a man and a woman, to the exclusion of all other 
personalities ; of their love and its consequences, to 
the exclusion of all other interests. The woman 
is an ardent creature, cramped by the conditions 
of a peculiarly mean and sordid existence; the 
man has the artist's temperament, and what he 
imagines to be deep convictions concerning the 
futility of the marriage-bond. The two agree to 
join their lives without the usual legal proceedings, 
and set out for a honeymoon in the South. For 
a short time all is idyllic with them, and then 
the inevitable break comes, to which we are led 
through the gradual stages of sub-concious unrest, 
growing irritation, jarring mutual revelations of 
character, and the clash of fundamentally opposed 



ideals. Then there is separation, and a long term 
of suffering for both ; finally, the sex-duel sees the 
woman the victor, the man's intellectual pride is 
abased, and they are reunited upon the terms that 
have been decreed by the wisdom of the ages as the 
only possible foundation for the family and for 
human society. It will thus be seen that the book, 
despite its boldness of speech and conception, is 
ethically wholesome. It does not seek by means of 
false sentiment to incline us to the acceptance of 
evil, and its moral emphasis is not misplaced. It is 
not a book for the young person to read, but it is 
one from which the mature mind can get nothing 
but good, and one which offers a singular satisfac- 
tion to the artistic perceptions. 

At discreet intervals, Mr. Herman Knickerbocker 
Viel^ projects a new romantic invention into the 
sphere of publicity, and thereby occasions much joy 
to the knowing. There have been three of these 
projections heretofore, and the fourth is now at 
hand, alluringly entitled "Heartbreak Hill." The 
HiU is described by the heroine as " an incorrigible 
amorphic orphan, abandoned to the mercies of a 
self-satisfied Upper SUurian family," which means 
that it lifts its shaggy form above the surroimding 
flatness of field and meadow, and tries to make up 
in picturesqueness what it lacks in utility. It is the 
joint property of two cousins — a boy and a girl — 
having come into the family through an ancestral 
dicker with the Indians. That the pioneer who 
bought it for a jug of rum had a long head becomes 
apparent as the story progresses, because numerous 
persons make efforts to secure its ownership with- 
out disclosing any apparently adequate motives. The 
secret of the matter is that the Hill hides a rich 
vein of copper which is destined to enrich the 
cousins when they have thwarted various efforts on 
the part of outsiders to come into possession. By a 
singular coincidence, these young people also join 
their fortunes in another and more intimate relation. 
This is pleasant, because they are nice young 
people, and quite deserving of each other. Such is 
the substance of a story which is written in the vein 
of light-hearted comedy for which Mr. Viel^ has 
prepared us by his earlier books, and which is a 
work of delicate art in its every detail. Sentiment 
and humor are nicely balanced in its pages, and the 
transcript of New England life and character is 
both truthful and charming. 

"The Last Voyage of the Donna Isabel" is a 
brave tale of a young American hiding in Val- 
paraiso, who is tricked into stealing an English- 
man's yacht, and finds himself in nominal command 
of a crew of pirates. They have lured him into 
this compromising position because they have need 
of his seamanship, but he is otherwise completely 
at their mercy. Their objective point is in the 
Antarctic Ocean, whence strange report has come 
of a treasure-ship — a Spanish galleon — held fast in 
the ice for a century and a half. Unwittingly, they 
have not only stolen the yacht but have also abducted 
the owner's wife, whose presence on board was not

suspected. Thus a heroine is provided for our 
hero, for Lady Darlington is young and charming, 
and does not love her aged husband overmuch. 
However, the conventions are respected until the 
final discovery, after the yacht has returned from 
its perilous voyage, that its owner has been conven- 
iently assassinated in the meantime. As for the 
Donna Isabel — a Spanish ship despite its un- 
Spanish name — that also is discovered, filled with 
gold and corpses, but the treasure goes to the bot- 
tom of the sea, together with most of the pirates. 
This is evidently the outline of a "rattling" story, 
and it must be reckoned among the most successful 
of Mr. Randall Parrish's inventions. 

"The Castle of Dawn" is the alluring title of 
Mr. Harold Morton Kramer's tale of the Ozarks. 
The castle is a palatial mountain residence, no longer 
inhabited by the buUder whose tastes it embodies, 
but become the refuge of certain conspirators 
against the stability of a Spanish- American repub- 
lic. To this retreat a newspaper reporter from 
Chicago and the daughter of a purse-proud million- 
aire find their way, being, in fact, kidnapped by the 
conspirators, who mistakenly fancy these innocent 
young people the enemies of their patriotic cause. 
The period of captivity is long enough for propin- 
quity to do its deadly work, and the two, entire 
strangers to each other at first, develop after a few 
weeks into a pair of romantically interesting lovers. 
Of their exciting adventures and thrilling escape we 
will say naught in detail ; these particulars are 
eminently satisfying to the romantic mood. We 
may say a word in commendation of the crisp dia 
logue and humorous touch which are features of the 
author's literary equipment. He has clothed an es- 
sentially imaginative story-skeleton in the garb of 
reality, and has just escaped the obvious danger of 
lapsing into melodrama. It is all very trifling, but 
it is also very diverting. 

"Kitty Tailleur" in England, "The Immortal 
Moment " in the United States — these are the 
titles chosen, to the confusion of both librarians and 
readers, for Miss May Sinclair's latest novel. The 
reprehensible practice here indicated should never 
be allowed to go without a sharp word of censure. 
The story is of the flimsiest texture, and consists 
largely of frothy dialogue, which, however, does 
produce its effect in illuminating the characters of 
the two persons mainly concerned. These are the 
charming Kitty and the simple-minded man whom 
she captivates. They meet in a seaside hotel, and 
it takes less than two weeks to bring them into re- 
lations which mean acute misery for the man and 
self-destruction for the woman. For Kitty, who 
is nice, is also naughty, or at least has been naughty 
to a quite unpardonable degree. And when the 
man, to whom the very thought of such evil as her 
life has embodied is almost inconceivable, has the 
truth thrust in his face, tragedy ensues. For he 
has championed her against the gossippers, has be- 
lieved in her, and has asked her to be his wife. 
Her " immortal moment " is ironically so called, for 



it is the moment in which her higher nature asserts 
itself, and she makes the confession which she 
knows must end her dream. It is a delicate subject, 
but we must add that it is handled with delicacy. 
As a faint reflex of the Camille story this one must 
be set down as essentially immoral, simply because 
its intention is to throw a sentimental glamor over 
the ugly outlines of depravity. But we cannot dis- 
pute its literary art or its emotional subtlety. 

We have not had a story of the Civil Wars in 
England for some time, and Mr. H. C. Bailey's 
" Colonel Greatheart " is a particularly good one. 
The title is fanciful, as indicating the quality rather 
than the actual cognomen of his hero. One Colonel 
Stow, it seems, returning to England after service 
in the Thirty Years' War, finds King and Par- 
liament at odds. Strife has begun, the court is at 
Oxford, Rupert is the man of the hour on one side, 
while on the other the genius of one Oliver Crom- 
well has not yet made itself manifest. Our hero is 
urged by the lady love of his youth to espouse the 
royalist cause, which he does, being a romantic 
idealist, although even then to the eye of a trained 
soldier that cause is foredoomed. The tale runs 
from Marston Moor to Naseby, and our hero gives 
a good acccount of himself personally, although his 
side is steadily losing. But worse than the defeats 
of the royalist forces are his personal and moral de- 
feats, for he is doubly betrayed, by the woman whom 
he loves, and by his dearest companion-in-arms. 
Nevertheless, his honor is engaged, and he fights on 
in a cause which no longer means aught to him, and 
nearly loses his life in a desperate effort to save the 
King from his own weakness. In the end, he for- 
sakes the field, and finds balm for his wounded af- 
fections in the love of a puritan maid. This is the 
outline of the story, but certain other things remain 
to be said. The historical figures — Charles and 
Rupert, Cromwell, Fairfax, and Ireton, are no more 
than sketched, but the strokes are masterly. The 
puritan jargon is reproduced with astonishing 
vividness and force. And the wild passions at play 
are relieved by certain interludes of comedy pro- 
vided by the hero's two French serving-men, Alci- 
biade and Matthieu-Marc-Luc, whose activities pro- 
vide us with the most amusing Sancho-contrasts to 
the deeds of our Greatheart Quixote. 

Again we have a story which is produced by the 
joint efforts of Mr. Eden Phillpotts and Mr. 
Arnold Bennett, and again we are puzzled to know 
where Mr. Phillpotts comes in. For of that strong 
and serious writer, with his love of wild nature and 
his deep comprehension of the primitive passions of 
the Dartmoor peasantry, we find no trace in these 
collaborative inventions. His own distinetive work- 
manship is not to be discovered in "The Statue," 
which is no more than a melodramatic tale of ingen- 
ious intrigue, of mysterious crime, and of detection 
and retribution. Taking it upon this low level, the 
story is effective; the secret is kept well in hand

THE DIAL

Mr. Harold Bindloss is a writer who repeats him- 
self unduly, and yet one whose books we always 
read with interest. Just now he offers us two of 
them, " By Right of Purchase " and " Long Odds." 
The former of these two is little more than a 
replica of his earlier stories of life in the Ameri- 
can Northwest. It has its beginnings in England, 
to be sure, for its farmer-hero is there upon a vaca- 
tion, and there he wins the bride who accompanies 
him back to the prairies. It is his bank account 
and his acres that really win her and the conquest 
of her heart remains to be achieved. Meanwhile, 
she makes the sacrifice for the sake of her indolent 
and improvident family. Once fairly established 
in Canada, we have again the story that Mr. Bind- 
loss has told so often ( and so well) before, the story 
of hard toU for uncertain harvests, woven in with 
the story of the strong, good man and his foes. 
These foes in the present instance are whiskey- 
smugglers and cattle-rustlers, and are a particularly 
desperate gang of scoundrels. Of course they are 
routed in the end, and equally of course the market 
goes up just in time to save the hero from bank- 
ruptcy. And slowly, as these matters progress 
toward their logical conclusion, the hero's wife 
learns to love him for his manly strength and 
single-hearted devotion, and gives herself to him in 
fact as well as in name. 

" Long Odds " represents the other of the two 
interests thus far exploited by Mr. Bindloss in his 
novels — the interest which transports us to Latin 
countries and their peoples, to Spaniards in Cuba 
and to Portuguese in the Canaries. Of course, the 
hero is still an Englishman. This time he is an 
Englishman broken by false accusations, and self- 
exiled upon the west coast of Africa. After some 
years, fortune and good name come back to him, 
and at this point the story opens. He is recalled 
to the Canaries, where the woman is sojourning 
whom he had once expected to make his wife, and 
is given to understand that the old relation may be 
resumed. Accepting the situation, he makes per- 
functory love to her, but is all the time conscious 
that their ideals are hopelessly at variance. He 
has lived with grim realities, and she knows and 
feels nothing beyond her narrow circle of petty 
social conventions. His stay in the Canaries is not 
for long, however, for he has duties which soon take 
him back to Africa. He is pledged to rescue a 
native girl from a scoundrelly trader, and to re- 
store to their village a number of boys who have 
been enslaved. Since he is the kind of English- 
man who does things, both these aims are achieved, 
and in the achieving of them is the adventurous 
substance of the tale. Its sentimental substance is 
provided by his relations with the fascinating 
daughter of a Portuguese oflBcer, whom he knows to 
be the woman really meant for him, and with whom 
we leave him after the Englishwoman has found an 
even more eligible parti, and been suitably dis- 
posed of without hard feelings on either side. Mr. 
Bindloss shows himself well acquainted with the 



conditions of existence in the African littoral, and 
gives us clear descriptions of natives and of such 
European types as the trader, the missionary, and 
the government official. He has not a little of the 
incisive power of Mr. Conrad in dealing with this 
tropical material. William Morton Payne. 



Briefs on New Books 

Editorial Marked by his customary geniality 

essays from of temper and lightness of touch, 

The Atlantic" ^jt^ just enough of artistic detach- 
ment to lend grace and freedom to his style with- 
out rendering it too coldly impersonal, Mr. Bliss 
Perry's " Park-Street Papers " (Houghton Mifflin 
Co.) maintain the high standard of their author's 
work as essayist and literary critic. The ten chap- 
ters of the book are gathered from the ten years' 
issues of " The Atlantic " that have appeared under 
Mr. Perry's editorial supervision. The first five, 
styled collectively "Atlantic Prologues," are brief 
" toastmaster addresses," such as have in recent 
years introduced each January number of the 
magazine. They reveal the author in his pleasant- 
est and most gracefully humorous vein, and at the 
same time throw light on the ever-fascinating art 
and mystery of magazine editing. The remaining 
five selections treat of four famous early contribu- 
tors to the "Atlantic," — Hawthorne, Longfellow, 
Aldrich (both contributor and editor), and Whit- 
tier, — and of that half -forgotten New England man 
of letters who never quite " arrived," who in fact 
was "the editor who was never the editor," 
Francis H. Underwood. Centenary celebrations 
prompted three of these papers, while the death of 
Aldrich gave sad occasion for the excellent appre- 
ciation of his character and work. In recalling 
some of his personal characteristics, the author 
writes : " One of the most pleasant traits of Mr. 
Aldrich's comments upon men of letters was his 
unfailing respect and admiration for the well-known 
group of New England writers whose personal 
friendship he had enjoyed. His gift for witty de- 
rogation found employment elsewhere ; towards 
Emerson, Longfellow, Whittier, and Lowell his at- 
titude was finely reverent, as befitted a younger 
associate." Not always so reverent, however ; as 
witness his comment on Lowell's letters, published 
in his biography, — " How good and how poor they 
are ! Nearly all of them are too self-conscious. 
Emerson and Whittier are about the only men in 
that famous group who were not thinking about 
themselves the whole while." Although its con- 
tents are of so " occasional " a nature, the book is 
worthy of a permanent place in one's library.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



by a professor who thought the " revelation " of a 
dissected dog's, nervous system ought to take '' all 
the naoonshine about the beauties of Nature " out of 
him. But persisting in " an unscientific love for 
live dog," Mr. Sharp abandoned the scalpel for 
the fields. He retained enough of the scientific 
temper to keep him accurate and safe from undue 
romancing, but not enough to kill sentiment. " The 
botanist who is never poet," he says, " misses as 
much in the out-of-doors as the poet who is never 
botanist." One might say that it is the at-home 
feeling which distinguishes Mr. Sharp among 
Nature-writers. He believes in staying at home, 
provided home is not all brick and mortar, and 
" getting the honey " there. " To go to the seashore 
for one June, to the mountains for a second, to the 
farm for a third, is not a good way to study the out- 
of-doors. A better way is to spend all three Junes 
at this shore or upon this same farm. The first 
necessity for interesting Nature study is an intimate 
acquaintance with some locality. It does not matter 
how small, how commonplace, how near the city, — 
the nearer the better, provided there are trees, water, 
fences, and some seclusion. If your own roof-tree 
stands in the midst of it all, then that is ideal." 
Following this primrose path of home-staying, Mr. 
Sharp has made his little Massachusetts farm a 
centre of delight for himself and his many readers. 
The present volume has some pleasant summer 
records of birds-nests and blossoming flowers, but 
for the most part it tells of the out-door joys of 
winter — the muskrat's snug house, the Christmas 
woods, the song of the chickadee. Indeed, the 
volume might well have been named from its best 
chapter, " A Cure for Winter." 

Great Tnovemenu ^^6 need for a satisfactory historical 
and leaders in account of the progress of discovery 
biologic science, ^nd thought in biology has for a long 
time been keenly felt, particularly by teachers of the 
subject and by workers in related subjects, such as 
sociology or psychology. In the case of certain 
special biological sciences, there are excellent his- 
tories — Carus's valuable (though almost unread- 
able) "Geschichte der Zoologie," and Foster's 
" Lectures on the History of Physiology," which are 
not only of great scientific merit, but also have a 
real literary charm. Professor Locy, in his 
"Biology and its Makers" (Holt), has as his aim 
"to bring under one view the broad features of 
biological progress, and to increase the human in- 
terest by writing the story around the lives of the 
great Leaders." While such a plan seems likely to 
leave something to be desired in the way of com- 
pleteness and comprehensiveness, it has much to 
recommend it from the standpoint of those likely to 
use such a book in connection with the teaching of 
the biological sciences, or for the purpose of gaining 
a birdseye view of the scope and development of 
these sciences. Nothing is better calculated to 
catch and stimulate the interest of one beginning 
the study of a science than an entertaining account 



of the personality and ideas of its founders. 
Professor Locy discusses his material in two group- 
ings. The first part of the book is devoted to the 
discussion of the development of important bio- 
logical ideas and lines of work other than those cen- 
tering about organic evolution. This part of the 
book includes, among other topics, discussions of 
the rise and progress of histology, comparative 
anatomy, taxonomy, physiology, embryology, the 
cell theory, bacteriology, and paleontology. The 
second part deals with the history of evolution work 
in the strictly biological fields. Such separation of 
the material makes necessary more or less repeti- 
tion, and appears to have no particular justification 
other than that of convenience. The greater part 
of the book deals with the zoological side of 
biology. The history of botanical ideas and dis- 
coveries gets relatively little attention. The book is 
mainly a compilation from rather well-known 
sources of information. There is little evidence 
that the author has made much detailed study of 
original sources, the work standing in this respect 
in marked contrast to Foster's " History of Physi- 
ology." Practically, the only subject that receives 
really critical treatment is the history of the cell 
theory. While such matters as have been alluded 
to, together with an unacountably persistent ten- 
dency to misspell proper names, will cause the 
specialist to feel some disappointment in the book, 
they do not essentially mar it for the purpose and 
the audience for which it was written. For this 
purpose and audience it is on the whole admirably 
suited. It is entertainingly written, and, better 
than any other existing single work in any language, 
gives the layman a clear idea of the scope and de- 
velopment of the broad science of biology. 

Memoirs of a In these days of personal reminiscen- 

business man, •,, ,v n i. _ 

soldier, and ces written on the smallest provoca- 

dipiomat. tion. Some prefatory self-exculpation 

is not out of place in a new candidate for autobio- 
graphic honors. Gen. William Franklin Draper, in 
presenting his "Recollections of a Varied Career" 
(Little, Brown & Co.), says that he began to write 
simply with the view of leaving a record for his 
descendants. " But as I wrote," he continues, " it 
seemed to me that few lives had covered as wide a 
field as my own. My public experience, — as a 
soldier in time of war, a member of Congress while 
great questions were under consideration, and a 
diplomat, also in war time, — would be hard to equal 
in variety ; and my private life covers invention in 
important lines, and a business career, commencing 
as an employee and closing as the head of a large 
industrial establishment, perhaps the largest in Mas- 
sachusetts that is owned by its managers." Very 
fittingly, in an etymological sense. General Draper's 
paternal ancestors for generations back were en- 
gaged in cloth-manufacture, and he himself, in his 
cotton-mill experience, has maintained the tradition. 
His connection with the Draper Co. machinery works 
at Hopedale renders appropriate and welcome his

account, from personal recollections and other 
authoritative sources, of the Hopedale Community, 
which flourished (if such enterprises can ever be 
said to flourish) in the middle of the last century, 
when, as Emerson wrote to Carlyle, we were " all a 
little wild here with numberless projects of social 
reform," and every reading man had a draft of a 
new community in his waistcoat packet. The 
author's narration of his New England upbringing, 
his active service as an ardent volunteer in the Civil 
War, his two terms in Congress, his ambassadorship 
at Rome, his subsequent travels, and his business 
and social and domestic interests from first to last, 
makes good reading. It is an unvarnished tale 
compact of unembroidered reality. Nine illustra- 
tions and a full index add to the completeness of 
this substantial octavo volume. 



That men are swayed in practical 
o7«7r«.tr ^ff^ir« by subtle and complex and 

concealed appeals to their mental 
natiire, gives Psychology a voice in the conduct of 
life, from ethics and politics to fashion and adver- 
tising. The psychology of the great modern and 
great American industry of advertising has attracted 
the attention of Professor W. D. Scott, of North- 
western University, and there results a second 
volume by him on this topic (Small, Maynard & 
Co.). The thesis and consequently the plan of the 
book are alike simple. The advertisement addresses 
itself to the senses, feelings, prejudices, and mental 
peculiarities of the prospective purchaser ; some com- 
prehensible account of these mental procedures will 
furnish a basis for the preparation of commercial 
heraldings, and illustrations from "current litera- 
ture " will furnish examples of good and bad types 
of the art. It is well that the task, when done, 
should be as well done as Professor Scott does it. 
But the thesis and the book arouse the obvious com- 
ment that this kind of application is peculiarly 
complex: that the psychology of the text-book and 
the psychology of the market-place are not built 
alike. To find a reason for doing what you will 
decide to do without that reason, may be a pleasing 
exercise ; but it is not much more. Particularly the 
psychology of the responsive public is altogether too 
slightingly treated. Advertisements do not have 
the same effect in London, Paris, New York, and 
Chicago, and the psychology of Fifth Avenue is not 
that of the Bowery. It may happen that the future 
reader of the back pages of magazines will be so 
weary of advice as to resolve to boycott all adver- 
tised commodities; and the psychology of advertis- 
ing will have to be in part rewritten, and commer- 
cial talent find pastures new. 

Astronomical ^"® ^^ ^^^ leading astronomers of 
references in the Greenwich Observatory is Dr. 
the Scriptures. ^ Walter Maunder, whose latest 
excursion into the field of popular astronomy is an 
explanation of "The Astronomy of the Bible" 
(Mitchell Kennerley). There are many such allu- 



sions in the Scriptures, which in the author's opin- 
ion have not received satisfactory treatment at the 
hands of commentators because these have not pos- 
sessed a technical acquaintance with the science of 
astronomy. The author does not attempt to find out 
the astronomical system of the ancient Hebrew na- 
tion, as the material is too scanty. He first dis- 
cusses the various Scriptural references to single 
celestial objects and to constellations, and afterwards 
studies their use by the Hebrews for measuring time. 
At the close of the book are short studies of three 
astronomical marvels — Joshua's long day, the dial 
of Ahaz, and the star of Bethlehem, The standpoint 
of the author is that of a believer in Holy Writ, 
who is free from those notions of inspiration that 
modern science has rendered untenable, and is to be 
classed as a devout man well acquainted with the 
latest teachings of science and eager to use them 
in classifying obscurities in the Scriptures. In the 
field of philological criticism — which Mr. Maunder 
necessarily enters — there is much of uncertainty, 
and the reader often has a feeling of doubt as to the 
soundness of some of the writer's conclusions. But 
on the whole one lays down the book with a feeling 
that he has gained much of permanent value. The 
attitude of the sacred writers toward the various dis- 
plays made by the heavenly bodies is shown to be 
one of intellectual saneness and spiritual exaltation, 
in marked contrast with that of the heathen nations 
surrounding the people of Israel, who used these 
bright objects for purposes of divination or of idola- 
trous worship. The book closes with a closely 
printed table of nearly five hundred references to 
Biblical passages, chiefly in the Old Testament, the 
astronomical allusions to which have been touched 
upon.

(McClurg), which appeared originally in 1901, is 
now reissued in a revised and greatly improved 
form, having been rewritten in part and entirely 
reset, thus making it virtually a new work. In this 
edition the author has incorporated the results of 
further painstaking study, and investigations made 
not only in the United States and Europe but also 
in the Orient. The descriptions of the various 
weaves have been largely extended and amplified, 
thus adding much to the usefulness of the book, 
which now assumes the proportions of an authorita- 
tive work. Naturally, where there are so many 
weaves to be described, and specimens of some of 
them are so rarely seen, the information given varies 
considerably in extent. But it is more important 
that what is supplied should be accurate than that 
statements drawn from doubtful sources should be 
incorporated when only meagre details can be 
gathered. To the care taken to print only what is 
verifiable, the new edition owes much of its value. 
Two added features are drawings showing clearly

rug weavers, and a few of the designs found in rugs. 
This section of the book might with advantage have 
been considerably extended, — a pictorial guide, so 
to speak, as an aid in the identification of the differ- 
ent weaves, being much needed. To some extent 
this is furnished by the full-page illustrations, which 
are notable examples of reproduction, giving most 
faithfully the color and even to some extent the 
texture of the fabrics represented. For the present 
edition the number of plates has been augmented by 
three, — one from an early Italian painting showing 
oriental rugs decorating a balcony ; one of a remark- 
able sixteenth century English rug owned by the 
Earl of Verulam ; and one of an antique Persian 
rug of distinguished pattern. 

An analysis While the general reader (a genus 
of Attention not quite so extinct as is commonly 

and Feeling. assumed) is not expected to follow 
the several devotees of the several sciences in their 
more professional pursuits, he has an interest in 
knowing where the hunting-groimd lies and who are 
the redoubtable guides. Professor Titchener has 
once more earned the gratitude of the student of 
psychological problems, by an able presentation 
of " The Psychology of Feeling and Attention " 
(Macmillan). The volume consists of a course of 
lectures delivered at Columbia University ; and the 
treatment suitable to a general audience is equally 
suitable to the general reader. The book discusses 
analytically the ultimate mode of conceiving the 
nature of the fundamental psychological processes. 
For current usage as coins of the intellectual realm, 
the value of such terms as feeling, sensation, atten- 
tion, is sufficiently understood ; but an accurate 
essay is indispensable when technical definition and 
analysis are to be reached. As an example of the 
clarification of concepts, as a contribution to the 
mode of extracting the metal from the crude ore, 
the work may be strongly recommended to the 
student analyst.

BRIEFER MENTION. 



"Valladolid, Oviedo, Segovia, Zamora, Avila, and 
Zaragoza" are the six cities described in the latest 
volume of Mr. Albert F. Calvert's " Spanish Series," 
published by the John Lane Co. As in other volumes 
of this series, more space is given to pictures than to 
text, and in the present instance we have upwards of 
four hundred full-page plates. 

" Songs from the Operas for Mezzo Soprano," edited 
by Mr. H. E. Krehbiel, is the latest volume of the 
" Musicians' Library," published by the Oliver Ditson 
Co. The selection begins with Caccini and Monte- 
verde, and ends with Bizet and Massenet, with a score 
of composers between. Most of the composers are 
represented by a single selection each. Mr. Krehbiel's 
prefatory text is scholarly, and more nearly adequate 
than might be expected when two dozen musicians are 
discussed in as many pages. A group of nine portraits 
forms the frontispiece. 



Lady Ritchie, better known as Anne Thackeray 
Ritchie, has in press with the Messrs. Putnam a volume 
of essays to be called " The Blackstick Papers." 

A new edition of Rev. Joseph H. Crooker's notable

The J, B. Lippincott Co. publish a pretty edition, 
with portrait, of " The Love Letters of Mary WoU- 
stonecraft to Gilbert Imlay," edited by Mr. Roger Ing- 
pen, and furnished with a prefatory memoir. 

" The Ideal of a Gentleman: A Mirror for Gentle- 
folks " is the interesting title of a volume by the 
English philologist, Dr. Smythe Palmer, which will be 
published shortly by Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. 

Mary Cowden-Clarke's "Shakespeare Proverbs," 
first published in 1847, is now reissued by the original 
American publishers, the Messrs. Putnam, with an intro- 
duction and notes supphed by Mr. William J. Rolfe. 

Mr. Gilbert K. Chesterton's " Orthodoxy," published 
by the John Lane Company, is reported as being the 
best-selling book in London. The first edition has 
already been exhausted, and a second is coming from 
the press. 

In addition to his novel " The Spitfire," published a 
few weeks ago, Edward Peple will issue this autumn 
a second book under the title of " The Mallet's Master- 
piece." This is a story built around the mystery of the 
Venus of Milo. 

Last year one of the most popular Christmas books 
was '■ The Gentlest Art," Mr. E. V. Lucas's collection of 
entertainmg letters. This year there is to be a similar 
collection of American letters, edited by Elizabeth 
Deering Hanscom and published under the title, " The 
Friendly Craft." 

" An Algebra for Secondary Schools," by Professor 
E. R. Hedrick, and an " Elements of Physics," by Pro- 
fessor G«orge A. Hoadley, are recent school publica-

manual for young teachers, the work of Professor John 
Wirt Dinsmore. 

" The Taming of the Shrew," « The Two Gentlemen 
of Verona," and " Coriolanus ' are three new volumes 
in the " First Folio Shakespeare," edited by the Misses 
Porter and Clarke, and published by the Messrs. 
Crowell. From Messrs. Duffield & Co. we have " The

Poe, Hoffman, and Gautier is the cosmopolitan selec- 
tion offered us in the three volumes now at hand. 
Many others, from Boccaccio to Tolstoy, are to follow. 
Each volume has a frontispiece and an introductory 
essay. 

A new text-book of " Economics," rather original in 
plan and method of presentation, but embodying no 
theoretical novelties, has been written by Messrs. Scott 
Nearing and Frank D. Watson, and is now published by 
the Macmillan Co. 

The vogue of M. Ken^ Bazin's « The Nun," « The 
Coming Harvest," and other novels has revived the inter- 
est in this versatile author's " Italians of To-day " to 
such an extent that its publishers are reprinting it in 
Mr. William Marchant's translation. 

The Gyldendal Publishing House, Copenhagen and 
Chicago, announce a " Mindendgave " of the collective 
writings (thirty-one in number) of the late Jonas Lie. 
The edition will fill about about seventeen parts of 
about two hundred pages each, to be published monthly. 

Two volumes of " Essays by Mark Pattison " are 
now published in the " New Universal Library " by 
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. This publication will, no 
doubt, serve to make the author a personality to a large 
circle of people who have hitherto known him as little 
more than, a resounding name. 

The recent excellent translation of " The Elegies of 
TibuUus " by Dr. Theodore C. Williams, headmaster of 
the famous Roxbury Latin School, has been added to 
the Houghton Mifflin Company list. Dr. Williams's new 
translation of Virgil's " JEneid " will be brought out 
this month by the same house. 

The second volume of Mr. G«orge Saintsbury's " His- 
tory of English Prosody from the Twelfth Century to 
the Present Day " has just been published by the Mac- 
millan Co. From Shakespeare to Crabbe is the exten- 
sive range of this volume, which seems to indicate that 
one more will complete the work. 

Three recent school-books published by the Mac- 
millan Co. are the following : " A French Grammar," 
by Messrs. Hugo P. Thieme and John R. Effinger; a 
" First Course in Biology," by Messrs. L. H. Bailey and 
Walter M. Coleman" ; and an edition of " Selected Essays 
of Seneca," edited by Dr. Allan P. Ball. 

The first of Mr. Lang's famous Fairy Book Series, 
" The Blue Fairy Book," was issued in 1889, and every 
year since has seen a successor. The volume for the 
coming Christmas will be entitled " The Book of Princes 
and Princesses," and will be written by Mrs. Lang, 
though Mr, Lang edits the volume and contributes a 
preface. 

Mr. William Somerset Maugham, the play-writer, is 
a most prolific worker, no less than three plays and a 
novel having been produced by him last year in England. 
His play, " Jack Straw," is attracting much attention 
from New York audiences. His novel, " The Explorer," 
will be published early in 1909. The chief character 
in the novel is said to have been drawn from Cecil 
Rhodes. 

One of the principal books that Messrs. Longmans & 
Co. will publish during the present season will be " The 
Journal of Elizabeth Lady Holland," edited by the Earl 
of Ilchester. Lady Holland is known to the readers of 
memoirs and historical biographies of her time as the 
domineering leader of the Whig circle ; as a lady whose 
social talents and literary accomplishments drew to her 



house the wits, the politicians, and the cognoscenti of the 
day. As yet, however, little has been written of her 
earlier years, and on these her Journal will throw much 
light. 

The Poetical Works of George Crabbe are about to 
be added to the " Oxford Poets " series, published by 
Mr. Henry Frowde. The editors are the Rev. A. J. 
and Mrs. Carlyle, who have reproduced the author's 
own text, with additions and the notes that Crabbe him- 
self made. The arrangement of the poems is chrono- 
logical, and the volume contains a photogravure por- 
trait of the poet. 

Two new autumn novels not hitherto announced will 
be published in a few weeks. One of these is " The 
Elusive Pimpernel," by Baroness Orczy, author of " The 
Scarlet Pimpernel." The new story will continue the 
adventures in the life of the Scarlet Pimpernel, the scene 
of the story being laid during those exciting years of the 
French Revolution. The other book is " Mirage," by 
Mr. E. Temple Thurston, author of " The Apple of 
Eden." 

Two supplementary volumes of the " Classified Cata- 
logue of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh " give us 
the accessions from 1902 to 1906. The classification 
is that used in the three-volume catalogue published 
over a year ago, and nearly one hundred thousand vol- 
umes are listed, and, what is more practically interest- 
ing, annotated in this extension of the foimdation 
catalogue. The work is thus made widely useful for 
general bibliographical reference. 

Mr. Henry William Elson's " History of the United 
States of America" has been widely and favorably 
known for several years. We may realize how much 
matter was contained in the single volume when it 
comes to us expanded into five, and sizable volumes at 
that. Some of the matter is new, but only a small 
fraction of the whole. A large number of illustrations 
is a feature of the expanded edition which adds greatly 
to the value of the original unadorned text. 

The Linschoten Society, recently organized at The 
Hague, proposes to do for the early Dutch travellers 
what the Hakluyt Society has done for the history of 
English exploration. Linschoten's " Itinerario " heads 
the list of the proposed issues, which will appear at the 
rate of two volumes a year. The annual fee for ordi-

Last season President Nicholas Murray Butler, of 
Columbia University, visited the University of Copen- 
hagen and delivered there a series of lectures which 
attracted much attention. These Lectures are shortly 
to be published by The Macmillan Company under the 
title " The American as he Is." Among the special 
topics with which President Butler deals are "The 
American as a Political Type," " The American Apart 
from his Government," and " The American and the 
Intellectual Life." 

The third volume of the " Collections of the Illinois 
State Historical Library " is the first volume of a 
" Lincoln Series," and gives us, carefully edited by Dr. 
Edwin Erie Sparks, the full text of the Lincoln-Douglas 
debates, enriched by a large amount of material gleaned 
from various newspaper files of the period concerned. 
This liberal supply of local color, in the form of both 
text and picture, provides the present edition with its

most distinctive feature, and makes it highly valuable 
for the student of American political history. There 
are interesting sections upon the humor of the campaign 
and upon campaign poetry, besides a collection of trib- 
utes to both debaters, and a bibliography of the subject. 
Dr. Sparks is to be congratulated upon this informing 
and scholarly work. 

The headquarters of the American Library Associa- 
tion will remain in Boston for another year, or at least 
untU September 1 next. At the meeting of the Asso- 
ciation, at Lake Minnetonka, last summer, there was a 
unanimous vote in favor of transferring the headquarters 
to Chicago, as being more central and otherwise more 
suitable. It has been found impracticable, however, to 
secure quarters in connection with either of the great 
Chicago libraries, as was desired by the Association ; and 
so the project of removal has been deferred, although 
not abandoned.

OOOK publishers and book journals are 
'-^ alike sustained by a book public. The 
people who read book journals are the ones 
who buy books. Daily papers and miscel- 
laneous journals have miscellaneous read- 
ers, some of whom are bookish people. All 
the readers of a book journal are bookish 
people. The Dial is preminently a book 
journal, published solely in the interests 
of the book class, — the literary and culti- 
vated class. 



T^HE DIAL is more generally consulted 
* and depended upon by Librarians in 
making up orders for books than any 
other American critical journal; it circu- 
lates more widely among retail book- 
sellers than any other journal of its class ; 
it is the accustomed literary guide and aid 
of thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country.

MILTON AS A SCHOOLMASTER 

John Milton was born in London in 1608, just three cen- 
turies ago, his birthday being December 9. One interesting 
and useful recognition of the ter-centenary, which will be 
valued especially by our teachers, is the publication by the 
directors of the Old South work in Boston, as one of their 
large series of Old South Leaflets, of Milton's famous little 
treatise on Exlucation. A most remarkable treatise this was 
for its time.

NOTEWORTHY NEW TEXT BOOKS 



Salisbury's Physiography 



By ROLLIN D. SALISBURY, Professor in the University of Cbicagro. (American Science Series, Advanced Course J 
XX. + 776 pp. 8vo. $3.50. 

N. M. Penneman, State Professor in the University of Cincinnati: I shall undertake its use in my class in physiography. 
There is every reason to believe that it will be the standard text-book of physiography for colleges for a long time to come. 



Salisbury's Physiography for High Schools 



By ROLLIN D. SALISBURY, (American Science Series, Briefer Course.) viii. + 531pp. 12mo. $1.50. 
Intended to cover the work in the first or second year of the high school. 

J. W. Beede, Professor in Indiana University : I am of the opinion that it will mark an epoch in the teaching of the 
subject in the secondary schools as will the Physiography in the colleges. 

Fitz's Principles of Physiology and Hygiene 

By GEORGE W. FITZ, M.D., former Assistant Professor of Physiology and Hygriiene, Harvard University, and sometime 
teacher of science in Cook County Normal School, 111. xiii.+357 pp. 12mo. $1.12. 

A clear and simple treatment of physiology intended for a high school course. It lays emphasis upon hygiene and 
sanitation, with special reference to the conditions of daily life. Experimental work is fully outlined in connection with each 
chapter. 

Lillie's Development of the Chick : An introduction to Embryology. 

By FRANK R. LILLIE, Professor in the University of Chicago. xi.+472 pp. 8vo. Ready in November. 



Dewey and Tufts's Ethics 



By JOHN DEWEY. Professor in Columbia University, and JAMES H. TUFTS, Professor in the University of Chicago. 
618 pp. 8vo. (American Science Series.) $2.00. 

G. H. Palmer, Professor in Harvard University : It ia a scholarly and stimulating production, the best, I think, for 
college use that has yet appeared. Indeed, from no other book would a general reader obtain in so brief a compass so wide 
a view of the moral world of to-day, set forth in so positive, lucid, and interesting a fashion. Twenty years ago the book 
could not have been written, for into it have gone the spoUs of all the ethical battles of our time. While I often find myself 
in dissent from its opinions, I see that whoever wishes to comprehend the deeper social tendencies of recent years will do 
well to study this book, and that he will carry away from his reading as much enjoyment as instruction. 



Seashore's Elementary Experiments in Psychology 



By CARL EMIL SEASHORE, Head of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology in the State University of Iowa. 
xi.+218 pp, 12mo. $1.00. 

A supplement to a regular text-book in elementary psychology. i

ABBOTT, Associate Professor in Smith College. xi.+211 pp. 12mo. 80 cents. 

A manual for elementary work in composition, providing an abundance of helpful suggestions and of illustrative selections. 

Edwin M. Hopkins, Pi-ofessor in the University of Kansas : I have just reviewed it with a class of teachers in the 
summer school here, and it meets with general approval as a text eminently well suited for the beginning of our high-school 
course. 

Angel I'S Psychology (New Edition) 

By JAMES ROWLAND ANGELL, Head of Department of Psychology in the University of Chicago. ix.+468 pp. 8vo. $1.60. 
W. B. PiLLSBURY, Professor in the University of Michigan : I have used the other edition since it appeared with 
great satisfaction. This seems very much improved in many particulars. 

Remsen's College Chemistry (New Edition) 

By IRA REMSEN, President of the Johns Hopkins University. (American Science Series. J xxiii.+686 pp. 12mo. $2,25. 
C. F. Chandler, Professor in Columbia University : I am very glad that Professor Remsen has found time to bring 
this admirable book down to date. 

Qanong's Laboratory Course in Plant Physiology (New Edition) 

By WILLIAM F. GANONG, Professor in Smith CJoUege. vi.+265 pp. 8vo. $1.75. 

This revision retains the feature of the first edition as to use of simplified apparatus, but on the one hand extends it to 
include even the simplest appliances for school use, and on the other to include the more exact appliances giving definite 
Quantitative results.

The litigation over this book has

based on material furnished by 
himself and by his family. Mr. 
and Mrs. PenneU speak with au-

well as with full appreciation of 
him as an artist, and it is not too 
much to claim that this book has 
artistic and human interest such as 
few other biographies could have.

''MUCH THE MOST VITAL BOOK IN THIS BEPABTMENT FOB MANY A LONG YEAB" 

SCIENCE AND IMMORTALITY 

By SIR OLIVER LODGE 

The New York Times Saturday Beview thus describes this exceedingly important book : — 

" Sir Oliver sees the reconciliation of science and religion through the widening of knowledge — through the 

growth of each beyond the present need of the swaddling clothes in which each are still enveloped — though 

religion be considered the less advanced. 

" To that end science must extend its field of investigation into regions now usually regarded as too unsubstantial 

for scientific treatment, while religion, on its part, must invite and challenge just such rigid inquiry as science 

requires, and give up the primitive and ignorant notion that seeking the truth in certain directions is impiety."

" It is full of fresh and illumina-

ment, eloquent appreciation,

rangfe, comprehensive, omit- 
ting little that is essential, but 
avoiding the empty repetitions 
and trivialities which make 
most books about the stage so

it exhibits the brilliant per-

peculiarly appreciative consciousness of the foible of women 
and some men, and by a delightful tone of ironic wit. Post

Revolution, Wall Street in later times as the centre of govern- 
ment, as the social centre, as the centre of finance — the

AN EPIC POEM ON LINCOLN 

THE BURDEN BEARER 

By FRANCIS HOWARD WILLIAMS 

Limited to 300 numbered copies, artistically printed on special hand-made 
deckel-edge paper, and bound in half vellum, stamped in gold. 8vo. 200 pages. 

Price $2.50 net per copy 

If sent by mail, postage will be 15 cents per copy additional 

CRITICS who have read the epic declare that it is a worthy tribute to the man who for 
four weary years was the nation's burden bearer ; and that its publication is destined 
to be a noteworthy event in literary circles. 

Absolute simplicity is the keynote of the poem, as it was the leading principle in 
Lincoln's life. The author has been impressed with the fact that he could hope to main- 
tain that dignity which the subject demands only by avoiding the temptation to verbal 
elaboration and undue imagery. 

The poem is written in divers measures, the purely narrative portions being in blank 
verse and the more dramatic crises and battle pieces in meters varying with the atmosphere 
of the occasion. For the Emancipation episode the Spenserian stanza is employed, and 
the ballad and ode forms are used to give further variety to a work which seeks historic 
accuracy while avoiding prosaic statement of fact.

Author of " Hugh Wynne," " Mr. Kris Kringle," etc. Four full-page illustrations in color and marginal decorations on 

every page. Printed in two colors throughout. Square i2mo. Artistically bound in cloth. $1.25 

Laid in the same period as " Hugh Wynne," this story breathes the true spirit of the Revolution, and shows the patriotic fervor 

that in those days seemed to be in the very atmosphere. The " venture " has to do with the bold confiscation of a map belonging 

to Major Montresor of the British staff, and the carrying of it through the British lines to General Washington at Valley Forge.

This volume takes up those poets of England who truly 
deserve the title of great, from Chaucer all the way to 
Browning. Each one is carefully treated in a semi-biographical, 
semi-critical study, remarkable for its com- 
pleteness and breadth of view within the 
limited space afforded.

twenty-four other full-page portraits, and three fac-similes 

of the king's own handwriting. $3.00 net 

As the monarch who ruled England during the time of the 

American Revolution, George IIL has always possessed a 

peculiar interest for the people of the United States, and Mr. 

Willson's view is broad-minded.

For the amateur oarsman this book is almost invaluable.

PRESIDENT ELIOT. 



It is something of a coincidence that the day 
which determined the result of the recent Presi- 
dential election should also have been the day 
upon which the President of Harvard Univer- 
sity announced his resignation of the office which 
he has so long and so honorably held. When 
he assumed it, General Grant had just entered 
upon his duties as the official head of the nation, 
and during President Eliot's incumbency the 
country has felt the throes of ten Presidential 
campaigns, torn each time by passions more or 
less violent. Meanwhile, during all these forty 
years Harvard has pursued its even course, its 
development free from recurrent seasons of 
unrest, and has known the benefits of firm and 
wise administration, of a progressive policy 
steadfastly pursued. Here is a contrast indeed, 
and one that offers matter for reflection. The 
parallel of microcosm and macrocosm often 
proves instructive, and has rarely proved more 
so than in the instance now offered. The man- 
agement of a great and rapidly growing institu- 
tion of learning presents, in little, many of the 
problems involved in the government of a people; 
the political republic and the republic of scholars 
have many features in common. Both must react 
upon the pressure of the Zeitgeist, and shape 
themselves to an ever-changing environment ; 
both are required, as a condition of their self- 
perpetuation, to adhere to certain fundamental 
principles of action, and to oppose a conservative 
resistance to the onslaughts of radicalism. In 
meeting the difficulty thus common to the two re- 
publics, it seems to us that Cambridge, as com- 
pared with Washington, has found the better way. 

Harvard is now well along toward the comple- 
tion of its third century, and " the college " of 
the Bay Colony — first fruit of the sifted grain 
wherewith this Western world was planted — 
has grown into the great university of our own 
time. Of its twenty-two presidents, Mr. Eliot 
has had the longest term, and to find another 
of approximate duration we must go back an 
exact century from the date of his appointment ; 
for it was in 1769 that Edward Holyoke ended 
a presidential term of thirty-two years. But 
merely to say that Mr. Eliot's term has been 
the longest of all, would be a very inadequate 
statement of its comparative importance. In 
almost every respect to which the test of figures 



332 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



may be applied, its accomplishment may be 
fairly put in the balance against all that had 
been accomplished during the two centuries, 
more or less, that preceded it. The mass of its 
product outweighs all that came before ; and if 
this were the only test to be applied, the argu- 
ment would be quickly ended. But we should 
be the last to admit that educational achieve- 
ment is a matter of statistics alone, and upon 
the more delicate question of the spiritual bal- 
ance much may be urged in behaK of the earlier 
and less pretentious periods of the college his- 
tory. For strenuous devotion to an austere 
ideal, the Harvard of the Mathers does not 
suffer in comparison with any Harvard of more 
recent years, and the Harvard that sent forth 
into the service of the imperilled nation 

" Her wisest scholars, those who understood 
The deeper teaching of her mystic tome, 

And offered their fresh hves to make it good," 

realized an ethical standard which the future 
Harvard may emulate, but will hardly, improve 
upon. President Eliot's administration has 
fallen in pleasanter times that those of puritan 
combats with " that old deluder Satan," or than 
those of ensanguined civil strife ; but who shall 
say that Harvard has ceased to do resolute bat- 
tle with the powers of evil that still subtly men- 
ace our civilization? We may fittingly answer 
that question by recalling the gentle and heroic 
spirit that forsook its earthly tenement a few 
days ago at Shady Hill. 

We wonder how many of the men who were 
teaching chemistry twenty or thirty years ago, 
and making use of Eliot and Storer's admirable 
elementary text, were conscious of the fact 
that the book was chiefly written by the Presi- 
dent of Harvard. For it was as a chemist that 
Mr. Eliot won his early reputation for scholar- 
ship ; and when he succeeded Hill in 1869, at 
the age of thirty-five, his only certain academic 
title was that of a successful teacher of science, 
trained in the best foreign schools, although it 
was shrewdly suspected that he might possess 
other qualifications for his new post. The 
appointment was a break with tradition in more 
respects than one. It is true that Harvard had 
long before forsaken the belief that a college 
president must be a clergyman, but it had at 
least maintained that he should be a man of 
distinction in the field of the humanities, and 
that he should have reached a reasonable if not 
a venerable age. Many heads wagged solemnly 
when the long line of precedent was broken, 
and the most important collegiate presidency in 
America entrusted to a youth whose specialty 



was a subject only just beginning to be recog- 
nized as having any claims at all to serious 
consideration in a college curriculum. The 
bones of Increase Mather must have become 
restless in their grave at such a perversion of a 
stately office. Four decades have passed since 
then, and the young man whose career was yet 
to make has more than justified the confidence 
of those who were responsible for his selection. 
His influence has grown more and more com- 
manding, until now, at the time of his retire- 
ment from active work, he is clearly seen to 
have been for many years past the leader of the 
educational profession in America. 

Of all the changes brought about by Presi- 
dent Eliot's influence, the most important has 
been that of the introduction of the elective sys- 
tem into his own college, and its general exten- 
sion to other institutions. It was a greatly 
needed reform, for the attitude of professional 
education toward the new subjects, which forty 
years ago were clamoring for adequate recogni- 
tion in college courses, was not generous. The 
traditional curriculum was hidebound and its 
application Procrustean. New light and fresh 
air were brought into college life when science 
came to its own, and when the student began to 
be treated as an individual, for whom the best 
mental sustenance was not necessarily that which 
was best for some other individual. When the 
reform once got headway, it went too far, as all 
reforms tend to go, and the new men teaching 
the new subjects grew arrogant in their bear- 
ing. As we have frequently urged of late years, 
the reform now chiefly needed is one that shall 
take the direction of a reaction from the pres- 
ent undue preponderance of the new subjects. 
The demand that the humanities should be again 
exalted, and that science should be " shown its 
place," is now something other than a recrudes- 
cence of old-f ogyism ; it is rather the expression 
of the sanest and best poised educational 
thought. But for all this, the pioneer work 
begun at Harvard forty years ago was neces- 
sary and altogether admirable in its intention. 
We believe, however, that Mr. Eliot has come 
dangerously near to making a fetish of his 
theory that all subjects are potentially equal in 
educational value. This theory bears about the 
same relation to practical conditions that is 
borne by the theory of the philosophical anar- 
chist. Men might become virtuous enough to 
dispense with all repressive government ; the 
teaching of engineering or sociology might be 
made as pedagogically effective as the teaching 
of literature or the classics. But neither con- 



1908.] 



THE DIAL 



333 



dition is now even approximately realized, or 
gives signs of becoming realizable in any near 
future. 

Mr. Eliot entered upon his career as a special- 
ist in the ordinary sense ; he made himself a 
specialist in general ideas. By this paradoxical 
statement we mean that he developed an extra- 
ordinary capacity for grasping the essential con- 
tent of many systems of ideas, and acquired at 
the same time an extraordinary power of clean- 
cut and logical expression. His great admin- 
istrative abilities were the chief source of his 
strength in Harvard University, but they alone 
could not have given him the position which he 
occupied in the thought of the general public. 
It was because he could talk, simply and per- 
suasively, to almost any kind of an audience 
upon almost any subject of large general inter- 
est, because what he said was free from false 
notes, logically ordered, and characterized by 
sanity of judgment, that he gradually came to be, 
what all now know him to be, a real leader of 
opinion, not only in the educational field, but 
also in those of economics and politics, of religion 
and ethics, — all those fields, in short, with which 
man is deeply concerned as a social and spiritual 
being. And this leadership, we trust, he will 
still exercise for many years to come ; for it need 
be in no way affected by the fact that he has 
chosen to transmit to other hands his particular 
work of university administration. 



THE BACON TERCENTENARY 
AT GRATS INN. 



The 300th anniversary of the election of Francis 
Bacon as Treasurer of Gray's Inn was celebrated 
in that Inn of Court on Saturday, October 17. There 
was a luncheon at which the Benchers entertained 
many distinguished guests ; there were speeches by 
the present Treasurer and by the American Ambas- 
sador ; and there was a loan exhibition of Baconiana 
in the Benchers' Library. 

Francis Bacon became an " Ancient " of the 
Honourable Society of Gray's Inn towards the end 
of his fifteenth year, and maintained the connection 
for the rest of his life. His father, Sir Nicholas 
Bacon, the Lord Keeper, was a member, and so also 
were all of his four brothers, Nicholas, Nathaniel, 
Edward, and Anthony, his uncle William Cecil the 
Lord Treasurer, and his cousin Robert Cecil. Sir 
Nicholas Bacon had been Treasurer fifty years before 
his most famous son was elected to that ofiice, and 
it was during his Treasurership that the quaint 
Elizabethan hall was built where the Bacon anniver- 
sary took place. 

When the death of Sir Nicholas Bacon, in 1579, 
closed Francis Bacon's diplomatic career, and left 



him dependent upon his own exertions, he returned 
from France and took the place of Anthony Bacon 
in his father's old chambers, in Coney-court, near 
the hall, where No. 1 Gray's-inn-square now stands. 
Dr. William Rawley, Bacon's chaplain and first 
biographer, says : 

" He seated himself, for the commodity of his studies and 
practice, amongst the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn ; of 
which House he was a member : where he erected that ele- 
gant pile or structure, commonly known by the name of The 
Lord Bacon's Lodgings, which he inhabited, by turns the 
most part of his life (some few years only excepted) unto his 
dying day." 

The Pension Book (minutes) of Gray's Inn rec- 
ords many incidents of Bacon's life there as Bencher, 
Reader, and Treasurer. In his 25th year, " 10 Feb : 
28 Eliz:" he was admitted to the Readers' table, 
two years before he actually became Reader; he 
was elected Reader in 1588, and Double Reader in 
1600. In 1589 he served as Dean of the Chapel, 
and in 1594 as Deputy Treasurer. His Treasurer- 
ship seems to have lasted from 1608 to his elevation 
to the Great Seal in 1617, an unusually long term. 
It was from his Lodgings in Gray's Inn that the 
new Lord Keeper set out in state for Westminister 
Hall on the first day of Trinity term, 1617, "with 
the Lord Treasurer on his right hand, the Lord 
Privy Seal on his left, a long procession of students 
and ushers before him, and a guard of peers, Privy 
Councillors, and judges following in his train." In 
Gray's Inn he found refuge five years later, after 
his fall from place and power. His high ofiices had 
separated him for a time from his brothers of the Inn, 
but they received him again gladly. The Pension 
Book shows that they extended the grant of the lodg- 
ings he had built upon the late chambers of his father, 
so that he might have a saleable interest in them. 

"Myself for quiet, and the better to hold out," 
Bacon wrote in 1622, to Sir Francis Coltington, 
"am retired to Gray's Inn, for when my chief 
friends were gone so far, it was time for me to go 
to a ceU." From that cell during those busy last 
five years there came five books. He composed 
his Historic of the Raigne of King Henry the 
Seventh in the first summer of his enforced retire- 
ment. In 1623 he published the Latin version of 
The Advancement of Learning, now issued in nine 
books with the title De Augmentis Scientiarum. 
The poet George Herbert is said to have helped 
him with the translation. His Apophthegmes New 
and Old, 1624, can only be said to have been the 
occupation of a morning in the sense that he may 
have arranged the order of the stories in one morn- 
ing. The last three years were spent in writing his 
Sylva Sylvarum; or A Natural History, and in 
editing the third and final edition of his Essays. 
This edition, published in 1625, contains the fifty- 
eight essays of all subsequent editions, and was 
entitled Essayes or Counsels Civill and Morall. 

Bacon's chambers oveilooked the gardens of

33 Eliz : " reads : " Ordered that a brick wall shalbe 
erected to enclose parts of our back field, but how 
much thereof & where the wall shalbe sett & for 
the tyme when the same shalbe done, it is referred 
to the survey & direction of Mr. Anger, Mr. 
Stanhope, Mr. Daniell, and Mr. Bacon, & they to 
make report of their doings therein." 

In 1597 it is ordered that £7 15s. 4d., " due to 
Mr. Bacon for plantynge of trees in the walkes shalbe 
payde next terme, as soone as money commeth in." 
The following year a " new rayle and quicksett 
hedge " was to be " set uppon the upper long walke 
at the good discretion of Mr. Bacon and Mr. 
Wilbraham." April 29, 1600, it was voted " that 
there shalbe payed and allowed unto Mr. Bacon for 
money disbursed about the garnishinge & furnish- 
inge of the walkes as by & upon his account," 
£60 6s. 8d. 

Pepys speaks of Gray's Inn gardens as a " fashion- 
able lounge," and 200 years after Bacon's time 
Charles Lamb thought them the best gardens of any 
of the Inns of Court. In the essay Of Gardens, 
Bacon says he wishes " in the very middle " of the 
main garden '' a fair mount," " and the whole mount 
to be thirty foot high ; and some fine banqueting- 
house, with some chimneys neatly cast, and without 
too much glass." On the present site of Raymond- 
buildings, down to Lamb's time, there was such a 
mound in Gray's Inn gardens, and on it a summer- 
house which bore an inscription to the effect that it 
was built in 1609, by Francis Bacon, Solicitor- 
General to the King, in memory of Jeremy Betten- 
ham. Of Bettenham, who had been both Reader 
and Treasurer, the Pension Book says frankly, he 
"hath gained little profit by the law," but Bacon, his 
executor, describes him as " a man innocent and con- 
templative." Jeremy Bettenham lives to-day in two 
of Bacon's Apothegms, both dealing with gardens : 
"Mr. Bettenham used to say : That riches were like 
tmick ; when it lay upon an heap, it gave hut a 
stench and an ill odour ; hut when it was spread 
upon the ground, then it was cause of much fruit" 
This thought Bacon epitomizes in the essay Of 
Seditions and Troubles, into " Money is like muck, 
not good except it be spread." So again, in Of Ad- 
versity^ the figure, " Virtue is like precious odours, 
most fragi-ant when they are incensed or crushed," 
is Jeremy Bettenham's saying, " That virtuous men 
were like some herbs and spices, that give not their 
sweet smell, till they be broken and crushed." Bacon 
says he would have " whole alleys " in his garden set 
with burnet, wild-thyme, and watermints, because 
they " perfume the air most delightfully," " being 
trodden upon and crushed." 

" I trust," Lady Anne Bacon wrote to her son 
Anthony, in 1594, " that they will not mum nor 
masque, nor sinfully revel at Gray's Inn." First 
and last they revelled a good deal at Gray's Inn, and 
their best maker of masques was Lady Anne Bacon's 
younger son, who was the author or " chief contriver " 
or " chief encourager " of no less than six Eliza- 
bethan masques, an experience of writing in lighter 



vein that produced the essay Of Masques and Tri- 
umphs. Bacon's first Gray's Inn " device " was for 
a revel in the very year of his pious mother's letter. 
In 1613 he was the " chief contriver " of Francis 
Beaumont's masque, The Marriage of the Thames 
and the Rhine, which was performed by the gen- 
tlemen of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn before 
the King and Court at Whitehall, in honor of the 
marriage of the Princess Elizabeth with the Count 
Palatine. On Twelfth Night in the following year, 
January 6, 1614, the gentlemen of Gray's Inn pre- 
sented The Masque of Flowers, in celebration of the 
marriage of the Earl of Somerset and Lady Francis 
Howard. Sir Francis Bacon, the new Attorney- 
General, was the "chief encourager " of this masque, 
which is said to have cost him £2000. We even 
hear of the Lord Chancellor dining at Gray's Inn on 
Candlemas Day, "to give countenance to theyre Lord 
or Prince of Purpoole and to see theyre revells," 

On a cold raw day in the early spring, April 
2, 1626, during a drive from Gi'ay's Inn to dine 
with the King's Scotch physician, T)r. Witherborne, 
Bacon made his last experiment, an early attempt 
in refrigeration. He was seized with a chill, and, 
unable to get home to Gray's Inn, he died a week 
later at Highgate, the involuntary guest of the Earl 
of Arundel. 

It is announced that the Benchers propose here- 
after to observe the first night of term, November 2, 
as a Bacon Anniversary, and that they will place a 
permanent memorial of the Lord Chancellor in one 
of the open spaces of the Inn — probably South- 
square. This meniorial is to be a marble statue of 
Bacon by Mr. F. W. Pomeroy, A.R.A. A sketch 
model of it was on view at the Tercentenary, together 
with a collection of Baconian MSS. and printed 
books, some owned by the Benchers and some 
loaned for the occasion. Among the distinguished 
guests were Sir Frederick Pollock, Sir Robert Ball, 
Mr. Augustine Birrell, M.P., Canon Beeching, Canon 
Hensley Henson, Lord Strathcona, Dr. A.W. Ward, 
Master of Peterhouse, Sir S. Evans, Solicitor- 
General, Sir W. S. Robson, Attorney-General, the 
Earl of Verulam, and many others. After toasts 
to " The King " and " Domus," the Treasurer, Mr. 
Duke, responded to the sentiment "The Immor- 
tal Memory of Francis Bacon." His speech was 
an interesting account of Bacon's long life among 
them — forty-six years. Ambassador Reid spoke 
for " The Guests." He told the Benchers that if 
Bacon's whole connection with the legal profession 
was left out of account, his fame would stand be- 
fore the world practically the same. Mr. Reid 
might have quoted, but did not, Bacon's own almost 
divine satisfaction with his work as very good. 
Dedicating the third edition of his Essays to the 
Duke of Buckingham, in 1625, he wrote : " For I 
do conceive that the Latin volume of them (being 
in the universal language) may last as long as books 
last." Mary Augusta Scott.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A " NATIONAL LANGUAGE " FOB THE UnITED 

States seems a wild notion now, but it was the 
dream of Noah Webster, our foremost lexicog- 
rapher, and a writer of widely-used school text- 
books, whose sesqui-centennial was appropriately 
celebrated last month in his native state, Connecti- 
cut, where he was born (at Hartford) October 16, 
1758. It was fitting that the public schools and 
the university that graduated him should hold com- 
memorative exercises for this worker in the cause of 
popular education. How much else besides writing 
spelling-books and grammars and dictionaries he 
turned his hand to, as a typical Connecticut Yankee, 
it would take considerable space to relate. He 
fought, under his father's captainship, in the Revo- 
lutionary War; he studied and practised law, and 
sat on the judicial bench for a brief period; he 
edited a succession of periodicals, none of which, 
however, contributed greatly to his fame or fortune ; 
he put forth political and philological and miscel- 
laneous writings in great number and variety ; he 
helped to found Amherst College, and was for sev- 
eral years the president of its board of trustees ; he 
travelled and studied abroad in preparing his mag- 
num optis, his " American Dictionary of the English 
Language"; and, in a moment of extraordinary 
hardihood, and inspired by patriotic impulses, he 
undertook to reform the spelling of our mother 
tongue to accord with our independence of the 
mother country. " Now is the time," he proclaims 
to his compatriots in issuing his Dictionary, " and 
this the country, in which we may expect success in 
attempting changes favorable to language, science, 
and government. . . . Let us then seize the 
present moment and establish a national language 
as a national government." The sort of reforms 
proposed by this sedulous patriot may be inferred 
from the following examples of tentative forms that 
make strange the pages of the first edition ( 1828) 
of his Dictionary : ake, aker, groop, tung, wo, crum, 
maiz,f ether, steddy, ribin, skain, porpess. It must 
needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by 
whom the offense cometh. Most of these affronts to 
language were scoffed and hooted into inglorious 
retreat in later issues. But of the orthographic ills 
that were to follow, in the next century, from his 
example, he can have dreamed as little as that his 
work would develop into that monument of Ameri- 
can scholarship, the great International Dictionary. 
• • • 
The shameful estate of the English novel 
is pitilessly exposed to view in a recent magazine 
article on "The Censorship of Fiction," by Mr. 
Bram Stoker, who has already elicited a word of 
comment from us by his zealous and somewhat sur- 
prising advocacy of a muzzle for the novel-printing 
press. And now he puts the question again, vehe- 
mently and in words that burn, — " Are we or are we 
not ultimately to allow fiction to be put forth with- 



out any form of restraint whatever ? The question 
is not merely a civic or national one. It is racial, 
all-embracing, human. Fiction is perhaps the most 
powerful form of teaching available. It can be most 
potent for good ; and if we are to allow it to work 
for evil we shall surely have to pay in time for the 
consequent evil effects." He does not hesitate to 
declare that " within a couple of years past quite a 
number of novels have been published in England that 
would be a disgrace to any country even less civi- 
lised than our own "; and, further, in the production 
of these discreditable books he asserts that " women 
are the worst offenders." The situation is evidently 
worse in England than in this country ; in fact, the 
majority of the most objectionable novels in English 
published in the last year or two have come to us 
from across the water. Still, we have enough sins 
of our own to answer for, to preclude stone-casting 
at our neighbors. Fortunately, the most of these 
deleterious novels are not only repulsively vulgar 
but intolerably dull ; and thus they carry with them, 
in a way, their own antidote. 

A comedy from a librarian's pen — an " act- 
ing comedy," too, and a successful one if reports are 
to be credited — is surely a phenomenon in the 
literary- theatrical-bibliothecal world. To the scan- 
dal of some of his fellow-librarians, and to the 
amusement of others. Dr. Emmanuel Gottlieb Baum- 
wollenstrumpf. Librarian Emeritus and Professor of 
Bibliography and Library Economy at Ulpian Uni- 
versity, has written a one-act curtain-raiser entitled 
" Minnie's Mistakes " — a name which some may 
recall as that of the play so cleverly presented at 
the Junior Dramatics at Ulpian last year. Its bril- 
liant success at the hands of amateurs led to an ap- 
plication for the stage-rights from a prominent 
theatre-manager, and with the renewed success of 
the little comedy as professionally acted there has 
leaked out the hitherto withheld name of the 
author. We are fortunate in being able to give a 
few interesting details of the play's genesis and his- 
tory. As is already well known. Dr. BaumwoUen- 
strumpf is the author of several learned works, 
among which his monograph on " Accessions-List 
Practice in Roman Libraries of the Second Cen- 
tury" is perhaps the most famous, although his 
" Prolegomena to the Study of Finger-marks in 
Ancient Manuscripts " has been much admired for 
its scholarly and at the same time vivacious style. 
About two years ago it chanced that on coming out 
from a meeting of the International Association of 
Critical Commentators, of which he is vice-president, 
he was jocosely taimted by a passing acquaintance, 
an author of popular books in several departments 
of polite literature, for confining his literary ener- 
gies to works so dry and dusty and musty that no 
reader could open them without sneezing his head 
off. The professor took umbrage at this, and, to 
prove that profound critical scholarship and so-called 
creative authorship are not always divorced, he sat

down as soon as he reached his hotel and wrote 
** Minnie's Mistakes," which, as above stated, he 
first tried on the Ulpian students. Some excite- 
ment ovei' this event is to be expected in the library 
world — some such excitement, in fact, as has at- 
tended the publication, in "The Southern Cross" 
for September, of Dr. Pilnitz's short story, "Quite 
Another Matter" — Dr. Pilnitz being, as a news- 
paper paragraph informs us, and as doubtless may 
be learned by consulting " Who 's Who in Austral- 
asia," librarian of the Melbourne Athenaeum. But, 
after all, these exhibitions of unsuspected versatility 
are not at all alarming, nor are they very abnormal 
or incredible. Did not a distinguished English 
mathematician give us "Alice's Adventures in 
Wonderland " and " Through the Looking-Glass," 
and did not an eminent landscape painter produce 
some admirable nonsense verses ? We welcome 
these proofs of intellectual agility, from whatever 
quarter they may come ; and we feel assured that 
all enlightened librarians will view the matter as 
we do. ... 

A WHOLESOME DECLINE IN BOOK-CIRCULATION 

may seem to librarians to be a contradiction in terms ; 
but a qualitative instead of a quantitative analysis of 
a library's activities sometimes discovers encouraging 
symptoms in such a decline. The latest report of 
the well-managed and progressive Hartford Public 
Library dwells at some length on the increasing 
need of careful selection in the purchase of novels 
for circulation at the tax-payer's expense. Never 
before has the book world seen so large an output 
of fiction, and that means that never before has there 
been so large a supply of mediocre and inferior 
novels. By turning the current-fiction toper to the 
circulating library, the public library may lose an 
opportunity to swell its sum total of books loaned, 
but it gains in ability to complete its stock of stand- 
ard works and thus to raise the quality — and per- 
haps, in the long run, the quantity too — of its own 
circulation. The need of a supply, a large supply, 
of novels, old and new, is undeniable. Many a 
reader can recall how a story-book, perhaps of no 
superlative excellence, has in some hour of dulness 
or discouragement, stimulated him to seek and find 
pleasure and profit in some totally different book of 
a higher order. In their purchase of books, espe- 
cially of fiction, our public libraries can in a measure 
perform the office of public censor ; and some such 
censorship of the press as this is the only one to be 
seriously advocated. 

The SUBLIME confidence OF GENIUS always 
compels admiration. Even the whimsical oddities 
of a Whistler are the index of character. Among 
the memories of musicians which are much in vogue 
just now, there is one concerning the pianist Pade- 
rewski that happily illustrates the audacity of genius. 
From the current number of "Etude " we learn that 
this gifted Pole, in the days when he was teaching 
at the Strasburg Conservatory of Music, suddenly 



resigned his position and prepared to make his 
appearance in public, because he was refused a slight 
addition to his monthly pay at the Conservatory. 
This occurred in the autumn of 1889, and the re- 
lator of the incident was one of the scant three hun- 
dred in attendance at the Polish pianist's dSbut in 
Paris. " I shall never forget," he writes, " the thin, 
pale, almost cadaverous-looking young man who 
stepped upon the platform of that little hall. At first 
he awakened only an admiring interest, although 
everyone recognized the beauty of his tone coloring ; 
but when he finished playing Beethoven's ' Appas- 
sionata Sonata ' the audience rose as one man and 
cheered themselves hoarse. Here at last was 
deserved recognition, and from that moment 
Paderewski's success was assured. The following 
week he played at one of the Lameroux concerts to 
an audience of 3000 people, and the same scenes 
of excitement followed." This and the triumphs 
that have followed, thick and fast, the writer attri- 
butes to the young performer's courage in abandon- 
ing a sure position, modest and humdrum, for a 
splendid uncertainty — or what would have been an 
uncertainty in the case of nine hundred and ninety- 
nine out of a thousand discontented youths. 
• • • 

The children's story-hour at the public 
LIBRARY has been praised as a blessing and a benefit 
to the eagerly acquisitive young, and it has also been 
censured as an unauthorized and wasteful use of 
the library worker's time. There is much to be said 
both ^ro and con. Mr. John Cotton Dana utters some 
energetic words on the side of the plaintiff in a highly 
readable contribution to " Public Libraries." He 
urges that instead of calling on a library assistant 
for the time and energy that effective story-telling 
(including the preparation for it) requires, the same 
assistant might more profitably instruct a body of 
school-teachers in the art of story-telling, and let them 
do the entertaining of their little ones in the school- 
room. This, of course, presupposes special story- 
telling talent in the assistant and its lack in the 
teachers. Mr. Dana thus concludes : "A library 
gives of its time, money, and energy, to instruct 40 
children — and there it ends. If, on the other hand, 
it instructs 40 teachers, those 40 carry the instruction 
to 40 classrooms and impart knowledge of the lib- 
rary, of the use of books, of the literature for children, 
and — if need be — of the art of story-telling, to 
1600 or 2000 children. There seems no question 
here as to which of these two forms of educational 
activity is for librarians better worth while." 

• • • 

The delivery of library books to the pub- 
lic is growing more and more common throughout 
the country. Boston's system of book distribution 
through no fewer than 214 branch libraries and 
stations, scattered over an area of forty-three square 
miles, was recently referred to by us. The Newark 
(N. J.) library, however, with probably a smaller 
area and certainly a lesser population to serve,

makes use of more than twice as many distributing 
centres. Its Nineteenth Annual Report gives the 
number as 494, an increase of 465 in five years. 
" This increase," says the librarian, " of course adds 
somewhat to the cost of distribution, it being easier 
to lend a thousand volumes from a main building 
than from a number of widely separated centres. 
But the extension of library privileges to distant 
parts of the city seemed to meet with approval." 
Naturally it did ; yet one cannot but query whether 
there is not such a thing as making books too easily 
obtainable. Many examples could be given of 
young men, afterward illustrious, who have gladly 
walked miles to borrow a coveted book, returning 
it perhaps for another after a month's digestion of 
its contents. The writer of this vividly remembers 
the time when the weekly milewalk to the public 
library for a new book was a noteworthy and a joy- 
ful event in his young life. What comparable exhil- 
aration would there have been in running to the 
corner drug-store or the nearest engine-house to sup- 
ply his literary needs ? 

Two VACANT NICHES IN EnGLAND's HaLI, OF 

Fame are unaccountably slow in getting themselves 
fiUed. Next to the Bible, there are no books in our 
language so much read as " Robinson Crusoe " and 
" The Pilgrim's Progress." Yet their authors are 
unremembered in Westminster Abbey. A late trans- 
oceanic rumor, however, avers that, acting on the 
suggestion of an American visitor to the Abbey, the 
Baptists of Great Britain are raising the money to 
commemorate suitably the genius of John Bunyan ; 
and it is probable that his monument will soon be 
found where its absence has so long been a surprise 
to the visitor. Perhaps now there is hope also for 
Defoe. But whatever the event in these two instances, 
far better and more imperishable than storied urn or 
animated bust are the literary monuments we have 
from the hands of the men themselves. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



HAVE WE A NATIONAL ANTHEM? 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
I have read with interest your comments on " A 
National Anthem to Order," in connection with the 
offer (a rather absurd one, as it seems to me) made 
by the National Institute of Arts and Letters, of 
prizes for the best productions designed to supersede 
" America " and " The Star-Spangled Banner." This 
is not the first time that prizes for a similar purpose 
have been offered, but without result, — as will doubt- 
less be the case with this recent effort. National 
hymns, as you well say, cannot be made to order ; 
they are produced, not for the sake of prize-money, 
but in some moment of poetic and patriotic inspira- 
tion over a great national crisis. To repeat your 
words, '"The Watch on the Rhine,' and 'The 
Marseillaise ' were not begotten of prize-offers from 



any institute of art and letters." Neither, I may 
add, was our own " Star-Spangled Banner," which 
I claim as our true national anthem, and which is 
officially recognized as such, more than any other. 
I append a letter written me from the War Depart- 
ment, which should settle the question as to the atti- 
tude of those in authority.

Madam: — Referring to your recent letter, with enclos- 
ure, relative to the adoption of the song entitled " The 
Star Spangled Banner " as the national anthem, I beg 
to inform you that while the Government has not adopted 
by law a national anthem or national air, paragraph 512, 
U.S. Army Regulations, 1901, provides as follows: 

" At every military post or station, the flag will be hoisted 
at the sounding of the firat note of the reveille, or of the first 
note of the march, if a march be played before the reveille. 
The flag will be lowered at the sounding of the last note of 
the retreat, and while the flag is being lowered, the band will 
play ' The Star Spangled Banner.' " 

It is also understood that a paragraph has recently 
been added to the Navy Regulations, which reads as 
follows : 

" All officers and men shall stand at attention whenever 
' The Star Spangled Banner ' is being played unless engaged 
in duty that wiU not permit them to do so. The same respect 
shall be observed towards the national air of any other coun- 
try, when played in the presence of official representatives of 
such country."' 

You are also advised that in further recognition of 
this air as the national anthem, the General Staff of the 
Army has under consideration, with a view of embody- 
ing the same in the revised Army Regulations, a para- 
graph to read as follows: 

" Whenever ' The Star Spangled Banner ' is played by the 
band on a formal occasion at a military station, or at any place 
where persons belonging to the military service are present 
in their official capacity, all officers and enlisted men present 
will stand at Attention. The same respect will be observed 
toward the national air of any other country when it is played 
as a compliment to official representatives of such country." 

Very respectfully, Robert Shaw Oliver, 

Assistant Secretary of War.

The Journal of an Amateur 
Vagabond.* 



In the words of a leading sociologist, " Flynt 
had the field to himself ; there is no one to take 
his place at present. Few men who live and 
know the life of the Under World, as he did, 
have his mental equipment. Many can retain 
the facts, but are unable to handle them as 
satisfactorily ; then, too, to be a friend and 
companion of tramps and criminals, and of men 
like Tolstoi and Ibsen, is to possess a wide 
range of octaves in human experience and men- 
tal grasp." Walter Wyckoff's graphic pen- 
pictures of life and labor in the lower strata of 
our wage-earners were, like Josiah Flynt's more 
rudely rendered portraits of criminals and 
accounts of their habits, the outcome of per- 
sonal experience. But no one at present is doing 
just the kind of work they chose for themselves. 
Others, however, will hear the " call of the 
road " and feel the impulse to see and to live 
the life of the " other half," although scarcely 
one in a century will possess Flynt's extraordi- 
nary genius for transforming himself at will 
into the very type of vagabondage or criminal- 
ity he selected as the object of his study. 

Undersized, thin, white, shrivelled, nervous, 
pursued by a demon of unrest, in early life con- 
fessedly unable to distinguish the tuum from 
the meum, as well as unable or unwilling to re- 
frain from falsehood and deception, and finally 
the victim of drink, Flynt was no bad specimen 
of physical and moral degeneration, the more 
marked because of his excellent pedigree on 
both the paternal and the maternal side — his 
ancestors being of the best New England stock, 
with centuries of honest living and right think- 
ing to their credit. There was so much of the 
artist's and the actor's detachment in Flynt 
that he could bring a coolly impersonal scrutiny 
to bear on those laxities and abnormalities that 
formed so large a part of his own being. In 
the autobiography he wrote shortly before his 
death, and which is now published under the 
title " My Life," he displays the same freakish 
disinclination as in his naughty childhood to 
confine himself to plain and literal facts. Even 
his real name, the time and place of his birth, 
the scenes and companions of his boyhood and

lishing Co. 



youth, are all more or less concealed or dis- 
guised or misrepresented. It may be worth 
while to make clear, so far as we can, some 
of the actual facts relating to his birth and 
upbringing. 

Josiah Flynt Willard — thus his name is 
given in full by the compilers of biographical 
dictionaries — was bom January 23, 1869, at 
Appleton, Wisconsin. He himself conveys the 
impression that he was born at Evanston, Illi- 
nois. His father, Oliver Atherton Willard, a 
Methodist minister, and, later, a journalist, was 
directly descended from that Major Simon 
Willard who helped to settle the town of Con- 
cord, Mass., was for forty years a prominent 
citizen of that place, held the office of town 
clerk a number of years, and also represented 
his district in the colonial legislature. It is 
apparently from Oliver's father, Josiah Flint 
WiUard, that the younger Josiah got his pen- 
name of Josiah Flynt, by the change of one 
letter. On his mother's side, he was a descend- 
ant of the godly family of Mather of Massachu- 
setts. Furthermore, Frances E. Willard, the 
famous temperance advocate, was Josiah's aimt 
on the father's side, although the book repre- 
sents her as a " maternal " aunt. 

After the death of Oliver A. Willard, when 
Josiah was but eight years old, the family made 
their home in an annex built on to the " grand- 
mother's house, not far from the main street " — 
of Evanston, the reader infers. Here they seem 
to have remained until the restless son, who 
had been a runaway and a truant from baby- 
hood, was old enough to go to a boarding-school, 
whence he soon made his escape, as might have 
been expected. Of this home-leaving he writes : 

" When we left this home the family became scat- 
tered, one going one way and the others some other 
way ; we have never all been together since the break- 
up. My brother, for instance, I have not seen in nearly 
twenty years, and have no idea where he is to-day. He 
also was possessed of Wanderlust, indeed we might as 
well call ourselves a Wanderlust family, because every 
one of us has covered more territory at home and 
abroad than the average person can find time, or cares, 
to explore."

wanderlustig as ever, again took the road and

bondage, relieving the tedium of tramping with

an occasional horse-theft or horse-loan, and a 
carriage-drive at some involuntary benefactor's 
expense. His experiences in " tramping with 
tramps," as coal-stoker on an ocean liner, as 
student at Berlin University, newspaper re- 
porter in Russia and elsewhere, visitor at Count 
Tolstoi s country home, special detective in rail- 
way and police service, and what else it would 
be hard to enumerate, are more or less familiar 
to readers of magazines, and to those who have 
looked into Josiah Flynts half-dozen published 
books wherein he goes into many curious details 
of his strange life. Somewhat different from 
all these is the following account of his not very 
studious days at the gi-eat Friedrich Wilhelm 
Universitat : 

" I may not have got much from the lectures, but I 
came in contact with such men as Virchow, the patholo- 
gist; Kiepert, the geographer; Curtius, the Greek his- 
torian ; Plieiderer, the theologian ; Helmholtz, the chem- 
ist [sic'] , and I got glimpses of Mommsen. He was not 
reading in the university during my stay in Berlin, but 
he lived not far from my mother's home, and I used to 
see him in the street cars. He was a very much 
shriveled-up looking individual, and when sitting down 
looi<ed very diminutive. He wore immense glasses, 
which gave his eyes an owlish appearance ; I saw him 
to the best advantage one afternoon when we were rid- 
ing alone in a street car through the Thiergarten. He 
had a corner in the front, and 1 had taken one in the 
rear. I hardly noticed him at first, and had opened a 
book to read, when suddenly the old gentleman began 
to mumble to himself and gesture. ' Ya, ya, so ist es,' 
I could hear him say. ' So muss es sein,' and he flour- 
ished his right hand about as if he were speaking to a 
collection of Roman senators. What it was that was 
' so,' and why it had to be * so,' I could not find out." 

An excerpt from Flynt's memories of Tolstoi 
will not be out of place. 

" Now, that I look back over the experience and recall 
the old gentleman's willingness to talk on any subject, I 
regret exceedingly that I did not quiz him about literary 
contemporaries and affairs. The principal thing he said 
along these lines that comes to my mind now concerned 
poetry and how it impressed him. We were sittmg in 
the music room, and some one had said something about 
the relative values of prose and poetry as methods of 
expression. Tolstoy preferred prose. 

" ' Poetry,' he said, pointing to the parquet floor, 
' reminds me of a man trying to walk zigzag across the 
room on those squares. It twists and turns in all direc- 
tions before it can arrive anywhere. Prose, on the 
other hand, is direct; it goes straight at the mark.' 

" Talking about America and Americans, one after- 
noon, he was much interested in William Dean Howells, 
Henry George, and the late Henry Demarest Lloyd. 
He told me that there were four men in the world that 
he was very anxious to bring together ; he believed that 
a conference between them would throw much light on 
the world's needs. Two of them, if my memory is cor- 
rect, were Mr. Howells and Mr. Lloyd." 

Josiah Flynt — like his father before him, 



but without reaching by four years his father's 
age of forty-two — drank himself to death. 
Pneumonia was the immediate cause of his de- 
mise, on the twentieth day of January, 1907, 
within three days of his thirty-eighth birthday. 
A few words descriptive of the man from those 
who knew him and were attached to him will 
be of interest. In some supplementary remin- 
iscences appended to Flynt's unfinished auto- 
biography we read, from the pen of Alfred 
Hodder, who himself died a few weeks after 
his friend : 

" What first struck me was his prodigality in talk. 
He scattered treasures of anecdote and observation as 
Aladdin of the wonderful lamp orders his slave to 
scatter gold pieces. The trait is not common amongst 
men of letters; they are the worst company in the 
world; they are taking, not giving; if they have not a 
notebook and pencil brutally before you in their hands, 
they have a notebook and pencil agilely at work in their 
heads. . . . Flynt had no safe-deposit box for his good 
stories, and no gift for silence; the anecdotes in his 
books are amazing; the details of just how he got them 
are still more amazing; he never learned to use up his 
material, to economize, and he was more amazing than 
his material. 

"At the moment the point I wish to make is that 
Flynt knew his vagrant in the open. He had a pro- 
found contempt for the books written by frock-coated 
gentlemen who have academic positions, and say ' sociol- 
ogy,' and measure the skulls and take the confessions of 
the vagrant in captivity. Skull for skull he believed 
there was small difference between that of the first 
scamp and the first minister of the Gospel. I set that 
down for what it is worth as his opinion. The confes- 
sions of a vagrant in captivity are always, he said, false. 
This I fancy is almost true." 

Another who knew him well said of his literary 
ability that " he knew and understood the ways 
of men, but when he wrote for publication his 
imagination seemed chained to earth. It may 
be he was too much ' on the inside ' to get his 
subject in perspective. Then, too, it must be 
remembered that Flynt was the tramp writing, 
not the literary man tramping." 

This lack of the literary instinct plainly ap- 
pears in his book. Especially in the scraps of 
German and French that he is fond of introduc- 
ing, he shows himself no careful scribe. But his 
narrative is all the more characteristic from its 
lack of polish. Like all that he has written, it 
is extremely interesting, even though far less 
interesting than his talk is said to have been. 
The portraits of himself and of some of his 
near kindred enhance the interest ; and the 
brief introduction by his literary friend, Mr. 
Arthur Symons, helps one to a better acquaint- 
ance with this attractive vagabond.

[Nov. 16, 



Modern Painting, Chiefi,y British.* 

The title of Mr. Phythian's " Fifty Years of 
Modern Painting " is misleading and untrue 
as an indication of what the book really is. 
" Modern Painting " is not English painting 
alone. Corot was a Frenchman, and Sargent is 
an American. Fifty years of modern painting, 
from the Frenchman to the American, would 
imply almost anything rather than a practically 
exclusive consideration of British art. 

It is not until the fifth chapter, which is 
nearly half way through the book, that the 
reader is apprised of the author's real intention. 
In the opening of this chapter, we are told that 
the book was written " primarily for English 
readers ; and emphasis is laid upon English, or, 
to use the more comprehensive word so much 
insisted upon nowadays, British art." It is 
quite natural to ask at this point, " Why did 
you not say so before?" It would have saved 
the critic much trouble, for he would not then 
have looked for any thorough description of 
modern art during the years since 1850, but 
only for an attempted estimate of the part the 
British painters played in this art development 
of half a century. 

With some disappointment, because of labor 
wasted under a misconception of the real object 
of the book, the critic, after this midway ex- 
planation, turns the pages back and seeks to 
estimate the value of the criticism of British art 
from the author's own point of view. There is 
no doubt that here is a rather tolerant criticism 
of the faults and vagaries of the Pre-Raphaelite 
school, to which the author devotes a good deal 
of space. In fact, it is only a criticism so far 
as must be, because the author's evident admi- 
ration of the painters of this school inclines him 
to eulogy rather than criticism. Yet he seems 
striving to resist this tendency, and will even 
admit that Holman Hunt is a little hard in color 
and deals too much in detail ; that Rossetti is 
not a perfect draughtsman, or even colorist ; 
and that even Burne-Jones painted not realities 
but types. Of Millais, who turned back from the 
faith and sought quite another kind of truth 
from that known to Holman Hunt, he does 
not wholly approve. Like Ruskin, he calls the 
attempted fidelity to minute detail, as shown in 
the Pre-Raphaelite work, "truth to Nature." 
It has long been known that such painting is 
very far from being true to Nature, and does

&Co. 



not even interpret her works intelligibly. A 
picture that needs a long explanation in a 
catalogue has obviously failed to express any 
special truth. Such is the case with Mr. Hunt's 
" Flight into Egypt." A proper contrast with 
the great French masters is absolutely needed 
here to throw a true light upon the painting of 
the last fifty years. Also the greater American 
painters must be considered. 

Mr. Phythian claims that Constable was the 
real founder of the modem French school of 
landscape painting. This is of course a matter 
about which there is much question. Boning- 
ton is also thought to have influenced the great 
Frenchmen, and some claim that the inspiration 
of the Barbizon school came from Holland. But 
whether from England or Holland, or, as seems 
more likely, from their own selves, the results 
of their work stand preeminent in modern land- 
scape painting. Where are the English pictures 
that can be compared with Millet's " Angelus," 
"The Sower," " The Gleaners "; or with Rous- 
seau's " Le Givre," and scenes in the Fontaine- 
bleau forest, especially at sunset ; or with 
Corot's " Evening Star " or " San Sebastian "; 
or with many of the wonderful works of Dupr^ 
and Diaz, and of Troyon, whose cattle-pieces 
even the greatest of the Dutchmen have hardly 
excelled ? 

No matter if the author is, as he says, writing 
"primarily for English readers," he should seek 
to tell them the truth, and avoid prejudice of 
any kind. Such a work should contain proper 
estimates of Whistler and of Sargent ; but it 
does not, although the latter's name appears in 
the title of the book, and his work has won him 
almost the foremost place in the Royal Academy 
in recent years. The French believe that 
Whistler was one of the greatest artists that 
ever lived. His portrait of his mother is 
thought by them to be one of the gems of the 
Louvre where it now hangs. In etching he is 
second only to Rembrandt, if he really is in- 
ferior to the great Dutch master. Melchers 
should surely be mentioned, for there is 
hardly a great g-allery in Europe that has not 
at least one of his pictures. Cazin, one of the 
greatest of modern painters of landscape, should 
be described and his work contrasted with that 
of the Englishmen. Such deficiencies ought 
not to occur even in a book having the tardily 
confessed purpose of treating primarily of En- 
glish art. 

The style and spirit of the first part of the 
work differ radically from the manner of the 
latter part. The discussion of the Pre- 



1908.]

Raphaelites is interesting, and at times broad 
and discriminating. The appreciation of Watts 
is excellent. These discussions are carried on 
at considerable length, and show faithful study 
and true understanding of the subject-matter. 

In the latter part of the book, which deals 
mostly with the art of other countries, the 
method adopted is very like that of a catalogue, 
and there is but little attempt at serious criti- 
cism. This is a great disappointment, because 
the writer's critical power is very unusual, and 
his acquaintance with pictures is noteworthy. 
A really great critical work could have been 
hoped for from the first part of the book, but 
the promise is not fulfilled. It would almost 
seem as if the two parts had been written at 
different times and put together without any 
proper relation to each other. 

It is true that English art has made great 
progress in the last few years, and that is 
because it has become more liberal and has pro- 
fited by study in France and other Continental 
countries. Insular prejudice has ceased to 
exist, or at least to .dominate as it once did. 
England to-day is open to the art of all the 
nations, and should seek to become one in the 
great brotherhood of artists whose hands are 
clasped around the world.

The Drama of John Keats.* 



" A tradition may be established about a man 
of lasting genius, but the final word can never 
be said." It is with this apologetic sentiment 
that Professor Hancock begins the preface to his 
literary biography of John Keats. The words 
are true, — for each generation, with fresh 
material discovered or with shifting viewpoint, 
has its utterance to express, its comment to add ; 
and, furthermore, the new generation is inter- 
ested in the new word if it be spoken with intel- 
ligence and weight. Thus it will be with Keats. 
It is not only the pathos of his story that keeps 
his memory alive ; there is the wonder that from 
such humble origin such an ardent worshipper of 
Beauty shoidd be born, and again the larger 
wonder that under the stern conditions of this 
brief life such absolute distinction and such 
worth should characterize its fruit. 

It is an appreciation of John Keats — an 
appreciation and an interpretation — that Mr. 
Hancock offers. " In this book " (again quoting 

*JoHN Keats: A Literary Biography. By Albert Elmer 
Hancock. Boston and New York : Houghton Miflain Co. 



from the preface) says the author, " I have en- 
deavored to conceive of Keats as the protagonist 
of a domestic drama, coming upon a stage of 
shifting scenes, as in the old chronicle-histories, 
— coming, playing his part, and passing trag- 
ically under the blight." Does this sound 
somewhat too heroical to please all lovers of 
this dreamful poet of an abstract world ? Mr. 
Hancock is inclined to write staccato. His first 
few chapters especially strain for effect. 

" Last of the brood — an inoffensive waif. John 
Bull — John Keats. Between the philistine and the 
aesthete what a natural gulf of unconcern! and yet in 
the aftermath of the Revolution there was feud." 

Is our biographer trying to write like Taine ? 
The hand is Esau's, but the voice is Jacob's. 

One thing worth while Mr. Hancock does at 
the start in contradicting the strange statement 
of Mr. Gosse, that " no poet save Shakespeare 
himself is more English than Keats." It is 
the universality of Keats, the remoteness of his 
inspiration from the immediate interests of his 
age and land, that constitutes his chief distinc- 
tion among his contemporary poets. Elsewhere 
the essayist does good service also in correctly 
interpreting a certain utterance of the poet 
which has often been twisted to the disparage- 
ment of Keats. Once he discussed in a letter 
" The two methods of attaining truth, the intuitive and 
the rational. In the midst of his argument he sud- 
denly broke out, ' Oh, for a life of sensations rather 
than thoughts ! ' And the exclamation, interpreted by 
its context, simply meant, ' I should rather live in the 
emotions of the heart, stirred by the imagination's con- 
ception of beauty, than in the intellectual truth gained 
from the processes of logic ! ' It is the impetuous cry 
of the poet for the intuitive perceptions of the higher 

nature. 

" ' Do not all charms fly 
At the mere touch of cold Philosophy ? ' " 

It is a very sane portraiture of Keats, after 
all, that the author gives us in this book, — 
thoroughly human, despite the fact that for us 
of to-day the poet's figure is " set in a mystical 
haze, luminous in the flooding light of his fame." 
Keats was a normal youth, — 

" A man's man wholly. He loved to smoke. He 
drank wine with relish; sometimes until he was ' pleas- 
antly tipsy.' . . . He enjoyed rough sports. He went 
to a bear-baiting. He saw the prize-fight between 
Randall and Turner. And he fought a man himself 
for some act of brutality. . . . He was talkative, bril- 
liant, when the talk was to his liking; when it was not, 
he sat silent. In the intimate circle the window seat 
was reserved for Keats. There we may best fix a pic- 
ture of him in the characteristic attitude of one foot on 
the other knee and the hand clasping the instep. . . . 
Broad shovdders, depth of chest suggest the stature of 
a larger man. [Keats was only five feet tall.] The 
profile invites affection; brown curling hair; forehead 
receding; nose slightly tilted; a finely roimded chin;

an upper lip rather thick, as if stung by a bee and in 
need of some gentle unguent. The full face, as he 
turns to speak, shows the distinction and the conscious- 
ness of the high calling. The hazel eyes glow with 
some inward light as his words issue in a low musical 
voice. There is self-assurance in his modesty; at times 
he is petulant, fiercely assertive." 

The interpretative portion of Professor Han- 
cock's work, however, is the noteworthy feature 
of his book. Some twenty-five pages are devoted 
to the analysis of " Endymion," a study which 
is thorough and suggestive, and corrects a fre- 
quent misinterpretation of Keats's utterances 
on Beauty and Truth. The essayist accepts 
without dispute the dictum that as a poem 
" Endymion " must be reckoned a failure. 
" Isabella," " Lamia," " The Eve of St. Agnes," 
the Odes, and " Hyperion " receive like careful 
criticism. The immediate success of " Hype- 
rion," the turn in the tide of contemporary 
criticism which now began to set toward Keats, 
our author attributes to the virility of the 
uncompleted poem — a quality not found in the 
earlier work. 

" There is in « Hyperion ' a rousing masculinity. It 
vibrates with mass power in action. Keats's principle 
of beauty in repose has been liberated into the beauty 
of dynamic energies." 

In the closing chapters which deal with the 
pathetic picture of the poet's last days in Rome, 
the biographer pays just tribute to the perfect 
devotion of Severn. Among the classics of 
masculine friendship there is none more gra- 
cious and tender than this. 

It is pleasant to remember that there was no 
rancor in the mind of the dying poet, no rage, 
no bitterness remaining from the savage person- 
alities of the reviews. There was only one 
critic whose judgment had depressed him — and 
that critic was himseK. 

« If I should die, I have left no immortal work behind 
me — nothing to make my friends proud of my memory, 
but I have loved the principle of Beauty in all things, 
and if I had had time I would have made myself re- 
membered." 

Thus had he wi-itten a few months before his 
death. There is no question of his sincerity; 
and it was not affectation that dictated the 
melancholy epitaph, " Here lies one whose name 
was writ in water." Yet he it is, — John Keats, 
whose first poetic preludings began under the 
influence of Spenser's melodious verse, — he it 
is who in due time becomes the poet's poet of a 
later generation and the messenger in English 
verse of a distinct and beneficent evangel : 
" Beauty is Truth, Truth Beauty, — that is all 
Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know." 

The pleasantest thing that we can say of 



Professor Hancock's book is this : the reader 
will not get very far in the volume before he 
takes his copy of the poet from the shelf and 
falls again under its spell. Truly, 
" A thing of beauty is a joy forever : 
Its loveliness increases ; it will never 
Pass into nothingness ; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health. ..." 

The publishers deserve a word of grateful 
recognition for having given us a beautiful book, 
handsomely printed, richly illustrated, and care- 
fully indexed. It will be appreciated by all 
admirers of the poet. "VV. E. Simonds. 



Essays at Large.* 



In his latest volume of essays, Mr. Benson 
invites us to a new point of view. Leaving 
that pleasant college window through which we 
have been shown such charming vistas, we ac- 
company him to his country home in vacation 
time ; we see some delightful old church towers, 
a slow winding river, quaint lanes and peaceful 
farms ; between our walks, our reading, and our 
long leisurely reveries, Mr. Benson chats with 
us so informally that we almost fail to observe 
that he is covering a wide range of abstract 
subjects and is probing each to profound depths. 

Contentment and friendship, humor, shyness 
and the dramatic sense, specialism and our lack 
of great men, optimism and equality, joy and 
the love of God : we have heard Mr. Benson 
discuss some of these matters in one or another 
of the various conversations we have had with 
him before, but he succeeds, nevertheless, in im- 
pressing us with the fact that they are many- 
sided, and that at college in term time we could 
not quite see them from the viewpoint we have 
in these holidays in the country. If we find 
our host no less serious when he touches upon 
questions of deep import than he was wont to 
be, we yet have the satisfaction of chuckling 
with him delightedly on occasion. His logic is 
as keen, his irony as delicate, as ever ; the flow- 
ing cadences of his style woo us like quiet music ; 
and always we are conscious that our two chairs 
are quite close together, and that Mr. Benson 
has a very friendly and companionable arm 
thrown lightly around our shoulders. 

So long as the book is before us, it is as 
essayist that we prefer Mr. Benson ; yet here and 
there we chance upon a bit of biography that 
causes us involimt arily to cast an eye slant-

wise toward the shelf on which we may find his 
memoirs of Rossetti and Pater, of FitzGerald 
and Tennyson; and we wish we might have 
more of the Hallam and the Henley, or the 
Gladstone or the Cardinal Manning, that we find 
sketched in a moment merely to point a moral 
or adorn the tale. Again, as we read, we find 
a paragraph of criticism so subtle in its analysis 
that we wish Mr. Benson had used a more 
generous share of his pages to such purpose. 
Reading on, we come upon word-pictures of 
landscape — such combinations of copse and 
meadow, sky and river, ancient wall and familiar 
farmyard, described with apprehension so acute 
and appreciation so sincere that we long for a 
book in which Mr. Benson shall describe every 
nook and corner of the England he knows so 
well and loves so earnestly with the same visual- 
izing power that characterizes the chapter on 
Kelmscott and William Morris in the present 
volume. Descriptions of scenery are usually 
dreary enough, but Mr. Benson fairly makes us 
see and feel the glory of piled-up clouds and the 
golden glow of a sunset that faded months ago. 

Mr. Benson would have us believe that a 
new medium of utterance is yet to be discovered 
by some fortunate artist in letters — a medium 
which shall obviate the " clumsy necessity of 
sacrificing the sequence of thought to the bar- 
barous devices of metre and rhyme, or to the still 
more childish devices of incident and drama." 
He reminds us that Flaubert anticipated a time 
when the writer would require no subject, but 
would express emotion and thought directly 
rather than pictorially. Readers of " The Altar 
Fire " and " Beside Still Waters " will readily 
understand that in those books Mr. Benson 
himself sought to approach this medium of 
expression. 

To select from these rich pages a few illus- 
trative passages is a task beyond the present 
reviewer ; yet custom almost demands that such 
a selection shall be made. The rare beauty of 
our author's style is shown in the following, 
from the essay on Friendship : 

" « To make oneself beloved,' says an old French 
proverb, ' this is, after all, the best way to be useful.' 
That is one of the deep sayings which children think 
flat, and which young men, and even young women, 
despise; and which a middle-aged man hears with a 
certain troubled surprise, and wonders if there is not 
something in it after all ; and which old people discover 
to be true, and think with a sad regret of opportunities 
missed, and of years devoted, how unprofitably, to other 
kinds of usefulness ! The truth is that most of us 
who have any ambitions at all do not start in life 
with a hope of being useful, but rather with an intention 



of being ornamental. We think, like Joseph in his 
childish dreams, that the sun and moon and the eleven 
stars, to say nothing of the sheaves, are going to make 
obeisance to us. We want to be impressive, rich, beau- 
tiful, influential, admired, envied ; and then, as we move 
forward, the visions fade. We have to be content if, in 
a quiet corner, a single sheaf gives us a nod of recogni- 
tion; and as for the eleven stars, they seem unaware 
of oui" very existence! And then we make further dis- 
coveries: that when we have seemed to ourselves most 
impressive we have only been pretentious; that riches 
are only a talisman against poverty, and even make 
suffering and pain and grief more unendurable; that 
beauty fades into stolidity or weariness; that influence 
comes mostly to people who do not pursue it, and that 
the best kind of influence belongs to those who do not 
even know that they possess it; that admiration is but 
a brilUaut husk; which may or may not contain a 
wholesome kernel; and as for envy, there is poison in 
that cup! And then we become aware that the best 
crowns have fallen to those who have not sought them, 
and that simple-minded and unselfish people have won 
the prize which has been denied to brilliance and am- 
bition." 

Mr. Benson is rarely epigrammatic ; yet some 
of his best thoughts are expressed compactly 
enough almost to pass as epigrams. Here are a 
few such sentences selected almost at random : 

" It has got to be proved that one was sent into the 
world to be efPective." 

" Life, which ought to be spent partly in gathering 
materials, and partly in drawing inferences, is apt to be 
a hurried accumulation lasting to the edge of the tomb." 

" The real pleasures of the world are those which can- 
not be bought for money, and which are wholly independ- 
ent of success." 

" An age which values notoriety above everything 
except property." 

" To acquiesce in appearing ridiculous is the height 
of philosophy." 

" No one can become great by taking thought, and 
still less by desiring greatness. It is not an attainable 
thing; fame only is attainable." 

" The poet and the idealist make and cast abroad the 
great vital ideas which the specialist picks up and ana- 
lyzes." 

" We tend at the present time to honor achievements 
when they have begun to grow a little mouldy." 

" There are two modes and methods of being great ; 
one is by largeness, the other by intensity." 

It is pleasant to think that Mr. Benson has 
upwards of thirty volumes to his credit — pleas- 
ant indeed in these days of feverish fiction, these 
days when the literary taste of so many of one's 
acquaintances is varied only by distinct prefer- 
ences as to which of the Ten Commandments 
shall be violated, in detail, in the books they 
read ; it is pleasant, and hopeful too, to think 
that a cordial welcome always awaits these quiet 
books, gently conceived and unobtrusively put 
forth from the ivy-covered quadrangles of an 
old English University. •

The Making of a Great Poem.* 



Nineteenth-century criticism took upon itself 
the special mission of examining into the sources 
of great masterpieces, in order to discover, if 
possible, the artist at work upon his materials. 
Shakespeare's source-books, those of Chaucer, 
Goethe, Milton, Tennyson, and others, were 
made the subjects of many studies. Although 
these in no sense did, nor ever can, fathom or 
explain the element of personal power in creat- 
ive art, they did at least serve to differentiate 
the special power of each artist, and make more 
evident the Miltonic, the Chaucerian, the Shake- 
spearian touch. Such a criticism is well worth 
while. Many a secret of personality thus dis- 
closes itseK ; from the contemplation of many 
artists at work, there may be hopes of an event- 
ual philosophy of creative art, distant as it now 
seems. 

That the twentieth century is likely to find 
congeniality in the same labors, seems quite evi- 
dent. An important indication of it is the 
publication of a large quarto volume of 350 
pages devoted to the consideration of the " square 
old yellow book " now in the library of Balliol 
College, from which Browning derived the 
inspiration for his greatest and longest work, 
" The Ring and the Book." Readers of that 
poem do not need to be told of the chance man- 
ner in which Browning bought the volume at 
the old bookstall in the Piazza of San Lorenzo ; 
how it lay hold upon him from the first glance ; 
how he read it, threading the narrow Floren- 
tine streets in his mechanical walk homeward ; 
how he laid it not down imtil finished to the 
very end ; and how stepping out on the terrace 
he saw the whole piece act itself over again in 
his imagination, and in the exhilaration of creat- 
ive joy felt that 

" A spirit laughs and leaps through every limb, 
And lights my eye and lifts me by the hair, 
Letting me have my will again with these." 

Surely, no poet could well give a more circum- 
stantial or confidential account of the birth- 
moment of his own creation. The external facts 
are all there ; the visitor in Florence even 
hunts out the veritable bookstall (looking to-day 
just as Browning describes it) with a half-hope 
that the same miracle may happen to himself. 

But the inner mystery remains, as remain it 
must, because art is something so much more 
than any mere facts, because the mystic power

we call genius is in the last resort forever unex- 
plainable — " the finger of God, the flash of the 
will that can." Nevertheless, there are certain 
questions we may ask with some hope of a reply, 
and in these source-studies may help us : How 
far does the artist's raw material control or 
master his creative activity? What is the 
difference between the material and the final 
product ? What personal equation in the artist 
effected this change ? 

Such questions find response in the monu- 
mental work of Mr. Charles W. Hodell. To 
secure the scholarly world against the possible 
destruction of the unique copy of the " Old 
Yellow Book " at Balliol, it is here reproduced, 
page for page, by photographic process. Its 
text being a mixture of bad Latin and vernacu- 
lar Italian, Mr. Hodell makes it available to the 
average reader by his own translation ; then 
follows a fascinating essay of comparison between 
the source and the art-product, the whole being 
concluded by topical notes, 641 in number, the 
result of much scholarly and painstaking re- 
search. 

A story more sordid, more cruel, more bar- 
barous, than that of the " Old Yellow Book," 
it would be difficidt to conceive. Indeed, the 
work was not a published volume at all, but 
rather a lawyer's file of documents and pamph- 
lets bearing on a certain murder trial that took 
place in Rome in the year 1698. Their collec- 
tor was a lawyer who had merely a professional 
interest in the material ; for him, it was simply 
a noteworthy precedent as to "whether and 
when a husband may kUl his adulterous wife 
without incurring the ordinary penalty " for 
murder. The human or ethical side of the 
tragedy made no appeal to this man. The file 
when completed was part of his law library, but 
not any part of his personal history. He bound 
it with a vellum cover for preservation, and it 
is this age-yeUow veUum that suggested the 
poet's name, " The Old Yellow Book." During 
the "decades thrice five," from the time the 
volume first began gathering dust in the Floren- 
tine lawyer's library until it feU into the poet's 
hands at the bookstall, its history is a blank. 
To a modern reader, nothing can be duller than 
this volume, — and, one would suppose, nothing 
could be more forbidding to an artist. The 
rights and wrongs of the case have apparently 
small interest to the lawyers ; to them, it is just 
a job on which to employ their professional 
cunning. Their casuistry and sophistry are 
utterly divorced from such human sentiment as 
might naturally arise. Pity for the wife,

sympathy for the husband, admiration or repro- 
bation for the priest — such natural feelings as 
we should expect to spring spontaneously from 
contact with this tragedy — are nowhere to be 
found in the book. Wherever there is a show 
of sentiment, its rhetorical parade betrays its 
insincerity. Browning's comparison of himself 
to Elisha in making the dead alive again, is 
not extreme. Truly, he had to breathe mightily 
on these dry bones before these men and women 
of a former day could stand erect, not only to 
play over again their parts in that long-forgotten 
tragedy, but also to tell through their own 
speech and in their own way the causes and 
motives that lay behind these acts. 

For that, after all, is the significant matter 
not only of " The Ring and the Book " but of 
all Browning's writing. He was a searcher of 
human hearts. No man, not even the worst 
criminal, failed to arouse his interest and to 
stir him to find out the underlying motives. 
What do these bad hearts mean? What place 
have they in God's world? How can the all- 
powerful and all-loving Father permit his chil- 
dren to plunge into such an abyss of evil ? The 
story of Guido Franceschini's brutal greed, this 
dark record of crime, appealed to Browning, 
not for its sentimentalism but for its profound 
spiritual meaning. 

And Francesca Pompilia Comparini ! The 
lawyers allude to her as a " wretched child," an 
" unfortunate girl"; they are solely intent on 
their technical pleading, and her pathetic story 
does not wring from them the slightest drop of 
human pity. But Browning read between the 
lines the story of a child-mother wi'onged — the 
story of a suffering woman, cruelly tormented 
by a husband who is backed by the whole 
structure of conventional society. 

Browning, on being congratulated for his 
wonderful creation of Pompilia, replied : " I 
assure you that I found her in the book just as 
she speaks in my poem." But without Brown- 
ing's peculiar genius, can anyone else find her 
there ? As a matter of fact, Pompilia's own 
affidavit shows simplicity and innocent suffer- 
ing, but gives no hint of her more striking 
aspects of character. It has no word concern- 
ing her faith in God, her thought of her child, 
her personal feeling toward Caponsacchi — all 
those traits that win us to her as we are won by 
few heroines in poetry. Almost the sole fact- 
basis for Browning's conception of her char- 
acter lies in the sworn testimony of Fra Celestino 
and his associates who were the spiritual guides 



of her last moments. Those men of long expe- 
rience who surrounded her death-bed were deeply 
moved by her innocence, by her tender forgive- 
ness of those who had wronged her, and by her 
faith in God. From such hints as these, the 
alembic of Browning's imagination created one 
of the most masterly portraits of the suffering 
saint in all literature. 

Quite the same is it in dealing with the third 
person of this .central group — Caponsacchi. 
Again Browning jjrobes far below the surface. 
The real Caponsacchi 's relation to Pompilia 
was limited almost entirely to the crisis of her 
trouble ; his own affidavit has a manly ring, but 
does not rise to any heroic pitch ; we have no 
evidence that his flight with Pompilia is any- 
thing more than a superficial adventure. 

Now, Browning was a great believer in epochal 
crises, supreme moments in life, and he realized 
that something of this kind might have hap- 
pened, converting the "fribble, fop and cox- 
comb " into a hero. Something in the look of 
the lady, " young, tall, beautiful, strange and 
sad," was a call to Caponsacchi's nobler self. 
A spiritual revolution took place. Pompilia 
became to him a revelation of God dwelling in 
woman as purity, long-suffering, godliness — an 
embodied Madonna, Our Lady of Sorrows. 
She challenged his worship in the most pro- 
found religious sense, rather than in the con- 
ventional sentimental hyperbole of romantic 
poetry; when the call of duty came he was 
ready, a soldier-saint, a true Christian hero, the 
most interesting of Browning's pictures of noble 
manhood. 

In the opportunity to make such comparisons 
as these appears the great significance of this 
source-study. We are presented with a mass 
of documents which to the ordinary sight is 
merely a chaos of charge and counter-charge 
between some commonplace persons in whom it 
is impossible to feel any particular interest. 
The poet took them out of this chaos, raised 
them into the province of art, vitalized and ideal- 
ized their characters, till, laying aside their 
commonplaceness, they stand for the poet's 
master-conceptions of human nature, his atti- 
tude toward conventional society, his faith in 
God. And so, beholding the Book as the poet 
found it, and the Ring as the poet left it, we 
realize more fully than ever that Robert Brown- 
ing was not only one of the greatest creative 
artists of our time, but of all time.

Briefs on New Books. 

Oreat campaigns The thii'd volume of Prof essor Oman's 
of the Spanish " History of the Peninsular War " 
Peninsula. (MacmiUan) continues a work al- 

ready recognized as one of great importance to stu- 
dents of military history. For the average reader, 
the care and minuteness of this study may seem for- 
bidding. The author, however, would doubtless dis- 
claim an ambition to attract the general reader, look- 
ing rather to the student for appreciation of his work. 
What he has done is to give with minute exactness, 
and in orderly arrangement, all of the old material 
bearing upon this war, together with such new facts 
as he has discovered in his profound study of the 
topic. Mr. Oman is one of the few men engaged as 
a teacher of history who has exact military details 
at his fingers' ends. Added to this, he has perfect 
knowledge of the topography of Portugal and Spain, 
so that his descriptions of battles and campaigns are 
rendered more lucid than the accounts ordinarily 
given to military manoeuvres. This third volume of 
586 pages covers the sixteen months from Septem- 
ber 1809 to December 1810, and its main interest 
centres in the campaign of Massena — a campaign 
which Mr. Oman himself regards as the real crisis 
of the entire Peninsular War. In that campaign 
the dramatic feature is, of course, the approach of 
Massena to Wellington's lines at Torres Vedras. 
The magnificent energy displayed in creating the 
defensive fortifications known as the Lines of Torres 
Vedras resulted, according to the author, in a series 
of apparently isolated yet really interdependent 
forts, so arranged as to render practically impossible 
any successful attack by the French save with an 
overpowering force ; but Mr. Oman shows that it 
was not upon the fortifications alone that Welling- 
ton depended for a successful defense. The defen- 
sive scheme was a three-fold arrangement, scientifi- 
cally planned and carefully executed. The fortifi- 
cations were an important part ; but in addition 
Massena's advance was to be harassed and checked 
by irregular cavalry or infantry pressure from either 
side, and his communications threatened. And a 
third essential element to a successful issue had been 
assured in the organized devastation of the country 
long before the French troops were within striking 
distance of Wellington's main army. The Lines of 
Torres Vedras were sufficient to check Massena's 
advance ; but in order that Massena might be forced 
to retire, and that Portugal might be freed from the 
presence of an enemy, the devastation of crops and 
the threatened cutting of communications were 
equally necessary. The general account here given 
of this and similar military movements follows very 
much that given by Napier in his historic work, and 
in few instances does Mr. Oman really criticise the 
results of Napier's research. Nevertheless, the pres- 
ent work is infinitely more accurate in minor detail 
than that of Napier, and it must also be said that for 
one interested in military history written on so large 
a scale Mr. Oman's work is distinctly more readable. 



His method of presentation, like his study, is leis- 
urely, leaving the impression of a disinclination to 
close the account of any particular incident or cam- 
paign. The present volume, like its predecessors, 
contains many excellent battle-plans, and has in 
addition a relatively unknown engraving of the 
Duke of Wellington in 1813, from a portrait in the 
Hope Collection. 

While the writings of Miss Helen 
andher world. J^^^^^^' inevitably acquire a peculiar 

interest from the limitations of sense 
in which the author lives, they equally merit atten- 
tion by reason of their intrinsic worth. True, in read- 
ing one never gets far away from the pro'scriptions 
of her world, and particularly so long as she is en- 
engaged in portraying to us what kind of a world it 
is. Miss Keller tells us that "The World I Live 
In" (Century Co.) is not wholly the theme of her 
choosing. " Every book is in a sense autobiograph- 
ical. But while other self-recording creatures are 
permitted at least to seem to change the subject, 
apparently nobody cares what I think of the tariff, 
the conservation of our natural resources, or the 
conflicts which revolve about the name of Dreyfus. 
If I offer to reform the educational system of the 
world, my editorial friends say, ' That is interesting. 
But will you please tell us what idea you had of 
goodness and beauty when you were six years old ? ' 
First they ask me to tell the life of the child who is 
mother to the woman. Then they make me my own 
daughter and ask for an account of grown-up sensa- 
tions. Finally, I am requested to write about my 
dreams, and thus I become an anachronical grand- 
mother ; for it is the special privilege of old age to 
relate dreams." At all events, this theme she has 
securely to herself. Miss Keller manages to sketch 
very vividly the character of the impressions, the 
many derivative indications of who's who and what's 
what, that come hinted and wafted to her alert senses 
made keen and appreciative by what is of most worth 
— mental impressionability and an appreciative imag- 
ination. Yet, after all, from our point of view, it is 
a gleaner's task. There is a harvest and enough to 
sustain an active mind in active health ; but the full 
richness and freedom of the wide outlook, the gener- 
ous and easy intercourse, are but meagrely replaced. 
And what replaces it is a possession much to be cher- 
ished — that of an imaginative literary sense. Miss 
Keller argues valiantly for the reality of her impres- 
sions, for the metaphorical significance of much that 
the seeing and hearing enjoy, for her right (readily 
conceded) to use the language of mankind, and for 
the comparability of her world to that in which the 
sun shines, color beautifies, and sounds make joyous 
and human. But the psychological reader remains 
unconvinced. Here, as elsewhere, it is all a matter 
of proportion. Doubtless language is saturated with 
derived, implied, and transferred meanings of things, 
and our intercourse is carried on in these counters 
without too much reference to their face value ; yet 
their use is fashioned upon the experience of their

origin, and " a primrose by a river's brim " is a very 
different thing to him who has seen it, however much 
for the purposes of a mood it would be equally effec- 
tive for Wordsworth or Miss Keller. All of which 
is intended to send the reader directly to Miss Keller's 
most interesting book, which, though it concludes with 
a metrical " Chant of Darkness," will be found to 
emanate much sweetness and light. 

The reiipion ^^- ^' ^' Wells's attitude toward 
and philosophy many matters of universal interest 
of an agnostic, jg already known to readers of his 
"Modern Utopia," "Mankind in the Making," 
" Anticipations," and other sociological essays. In 
his latest book, " First and Last Things " (Putnam), 
which he calls also " A Confession of Faith and a 
Rule of Life," he states his philosophical and reli- 
gious beliefs, so far as his avowedly agnostic lean- 
ings permit him to have any. All knowledge, he 
points out, is more or less vague, and even science 
is far from strictly accurate. No trimmed and 
rounded system of philosophy or religion is attain- 
able. We make our beliefs as we go along; at 
least Mr. Wells does. " I make my beliefs as I 
want them," he declares. " I do not attempt to go 
to facts for them. I make them thus and not thus, 
exactly as an artist makes a picture so and not so. 
. . . My belief in them rests upon the fact that 
they work for me and satisfy a desire for harmony 
and beauty." Thus he shows himself to be essen- 
tially a " pragmatist," though he does not use the 
word. He is also, as might be proved by quotations, 
a good deal of a mystic, cherishing an unreasoning 
faith in " the ultimate rightness and significance of 
things "; somewhat inclined to Cyrenaicism, paying 
homage to Beauty (with a capital B) as " something 
in me which demands not simply gratification but 
the best and keenest of a sense or continuance of 
sense impressions, and which refuses coarse quanti- 
tative assuagements "; unable to believe in a personal 
God and the immortality of the soul ; and contenting 
himself with making collective humanity the object 
of his deepest devotion, though he nowhere calls 
himself a follower of Comte. " It seems to me," he 
says in unmistakable terms, " that the whole living 
creation may be regarded as walking in the sleep of 
instinct and individualized illusion, and that now out 
of it all rises man, beginning to perceive his larger 
self, his universal brotherhood, and a collective syn- 
thetic purpose to realize power and beauty." And 
again, concerning "the purpose in things," he de- 
clares : " I have set down my broad impression of 
that purpose in respect to me, as the awakening and 
development of the consciousness and will of our 
species, and I have confessed my belief that in sub- 
ordinating myself and all my motives to that idea 
lies my Salvation." The last half of the book, treat- 
ing of " General Conduct " and " Some Personal 
Things," applies the principles enunciated in the 
first half. Although Mr. Wells's religion and phil- 
osophy may not be, and indeed cannot be, exactly 
those of any one of his readers, the book is valuable 



as the honest attempt of a man of vigorous and 
wide-ranging intellect to explain precisely what he 
believes and what he disbelieves. 



A new fund of ^^ p; ^' Chesterton, as all the 
Chestertonic world knows by this time, has the 
paradoxes. courage of his convictions. He would 
also, if he had his way, have everyone else possess 
a similar courage. In his collection of ephemeral 
papers (he admits their ephemerality ) entitled "All 
Things Considered" (Lane), he more than once 
condemns journalistic anonymity as the shelter of 
uncourageous and unstraightforward writers. No 
one can ever charge him with any such skulking 
behind an anonym or a pseudonym or an editorial 
" we." Whatever he has to say he says boldly and 
unmistakably in the first person singular, and signs 
his name to it. Letting this latest book of his open 
itself at random, we find the pronoun of one letter 
occurring six times on the left-hand page and seven 
times on the right-hand. Another commendable 
utterance in the volume concerns phonetic spelling. 
" Now my own fear," he tells us, " touching any- 
thing in the way of phonetic spelling, is that it 
would simply increase this tendency to use words 
as counters and not as coins. The original life in 
a word (as in the word ' talent ') burns low as it is: 
sensible spelling might extinguish it altogether. . . . 
If you spell a word wrong you have some tempta- 
tion to think it wrong." This and other praise of 
things genuine and uncorrupted is good. A man 
in whom simple truth is his utmost skill, we all 
admire. But Mr. Chesterton's fondness for the 
startling and the paradoxical betrays him now and 
then into saying things that he cannot mean. 
When he jauntily calls himself vulgar, he is either 
insincere or he attaches a meaning of his own to the 
adjective; and when he light-heartedly assures us 
in his preface that he expects his book will turn out 
to be " unintelligible gibberish," he is not rigorously 
honest with himself and his readers. If he really 
suspected himself of writing so much rubbish as his 
facility and his present popularity combine to make 
him guilty of, he would refrain from publishing his 
" unintelligible gibberish," and he woiUd study to 
produce less, and that of a character more worthy 
of his genius. It only remains to say that "AU 
Things Considered" has, in its incoherence and 
scrappiness and in its unrelieved joltiness of style, 
the Chestertonic quality distilled to quintessential 
strength. — — 

In " The Sense of the Infinite " ( Holt ) 
StS?"' Mr. Oscar Kuhns throws light upon 

a phase of the subject of Mysticism 
which, though not new, has seldom been favored 
with such a clear illumination. And in view of the 
present marked interest in super-normal states, the 
book would appear to be of interest as a commentary 
on the chief historic examples of the highest types 
of such states. The heart of the subject is laid 
bare in the second chapter, where to the question 
" What is the Sense of the Infinite ? " the defini- 



348 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



tion given is : " That instinct or sense or feeling of 
the human soul by means of which it is drawn out 
of every day consciousness and brought into an 
elevated state of mind, by the contemplation or 
vision of those things which arouse within us a sense 
of timeless Being, of the Absolute, the Infinite, the 
One." And this state of mind, the author finds, 
comes always from the higher elements of the soul, 
it owns no kinship with the gross delirium of nar- 
cotism or inebriety, nor is it gained by selfish gratifi- 
cation, but ever by a spiritual reaching upward 
toward that which is not of oneself. The three 
" Openings into the Infinite " are, Nature, Roman- 
tic Love, and Religion ; and to these three the suc- 
ceeding chapters are devoted. As a disciple of 
Dante, the author, as might be expected, is most 
pleasing in his treatment of the second aditus. It 
is upon this type of mysticism that profane writei-s 
have cast the greatest abuse ; and the apologia sent 
forth by our author is inspiring in that it is not writ- 
ten in the lesser style of a polemic. To the reli- 
gious or ethical-philosophic aspect of Transcendent- 
alism, chapters five to ten are given, including the 
topics of Platonism, Neo-Platonism, Mediaeval Mys- 
ticism, the Reformation, and the Pietist Movement. 
From all the ages, exemplars are called to declare 
their witness to the truth of the Sense of the Infinite 
and to its abiding influence in the life of man. And 
it is this influence in the present that forms the sub- 
ject of the last chapter of the work ; for the Tran- 
scendant Vision is not of the past alone, but is 
eternal ; nor is it a memory only, but a potent inspir- 
ation from the Sense of the Infinite. In few popu- 
lar works of the present time has the essential 
spirituality of mystic exaltion been so consistently 
maintained. 

Miss Eleanor Prescott Hammond has 
iKaZlrS:" placed Chaucer students under large 

obligations to her for a very useful 
volume entitled " Chaucer, a Bibliographical Man- 
ual" (Macmillan). Without including annotation 
of the Chaucerian text (except a few well-known 
cruces), or allusions to Chaucer, or the lighter " liter- 
ary " essays, or " third-hand " biographies, she has 
nevertheless filled a volume of nearly six hundred 
pages with references, well digested abstracts, inde- 
pendent criticisms, and judiciously selected extracts 
dealing with all phases of Chaucer's life and works, 
as well as the works (in a group by themselves) 
which have been printed with Chaucer's or attri- 
buted to him. The thoroughness of her work may 
be illustrated by the section on the " Canterbury 
Tales," which alone fills 175 pages, and includes 
elaborate descriptions (from personal observation) 
of most of the sixty odd manuscripts, with much 
detailed information regarding the individual tales, 
and long studies of their dates. The section on 
English libraries and on some Chaucer students 
(Shirley, Caxton, Theobald, Bradshaw, ten Brink, 
Lowell, Child, and Furnivall) is of especial interest ; 
but why fin nineteen pages with the list of publications 



(all elsewhere mentioned) of the Chaucer Society — 
a list which is easily accessible in many books ? 
Some of the matter in the Reference List, more- 
over, ^e. g., the rough lists of articles in Anglia, 
Englische Studien, and Modern Philology, — seems 
superfluous ; how it can help the student is hard to 
see. A few reviews of books, especially those on 
the language of Chaucer, have been omitted; some 
of these, of course, are not important. As far as 
we have tested the book, all the important works on 
Chaucer are noted in the proper places, and there 
are very few errors of citation or misprints. The 
index is good. As far as the author's work is con- 
cerned, then, we have little but praise of the volume, 
which represents the labor of years. The publish- 
ers will not have the thanks of students for print- 
ing a reference book like this (price $3. net) on 
paper which will not hold ink.

and Ideals (Macmillan) Mr. h rederic Harrison 
of a Potitivist. presents a fourth volume of his re- 
printed essays, all of them being based, despite their 
variety and diversity, " on one coherent scheme of 
thought — the Positivist Synthesis, — a reorganiza- 
tion of life, at once intellectual, moral, and social, 
by faith in our common humanity." Not quite all, 
however, of the forty-five articles composing this 
latest volume are reprints. Three, on the present 
burning question of woman suffrage, have been 
prompted by recent public discussion and agitation. 
England has had ample opportunity of late to see 
furens quid femina possit, as Mr. Harrison sadly 
admits ; and it is not surprising to find him vehe- 
mently opposed to any yielding to the demands of 
the "suffragettes." But when he says of female 
sufffrage that " the great Republics of France and 
America decline to risk their peace with any such 
anomalous fad," he forgets or ignores those States 
of our country that have, more or less completely, 
accorded the voting privilege to women. The first 
and longest essay in the volume, entitled " France 
and England," and advocating a systematic cooper- 
ation between the two countries as the key to peace 
and progress in Europe, was written in 1864, and 
is now, after forty-four years, reissued in the season 
of European ententes to which Mr. Harrison has 
never ceased to look forward. The second part of 
the book, embracing chapters on literature and art 
— the first part being devoted to social and political 
questions — is especially attractive. Noteworthy in 
aJl these volumes of writings covering half a century 
in time are the uniform literary excellence which 
they display.

work of arousing the national spirit and shaping 
events toward the realization of their hopes and 
aspirations. Perhaps the most remarkable of all is 
the gi'oup of leaders and heroes to whom modern 
Italy owes her existence, especially in the wide range 
of their abilities and the variety of their character- 
istics, Mazzini the Prophet, Cavour the Statesman, 
Garibaldi the Crusader, and Victor Emmanuel the 
King, as they are often named, suggest at once the 
range of interest and activities of the group. These 
men, including the earlier patriots Alfieri the Poet, 
Manzoni the Man of Letters, Gioberti the Philo- 
sopher, and Manin the " Father of Venice," are 
interestingly set before the readers of to-day by Mr. 
Rupert Sargent Holland in a book entitled " Build- 
ers of United Italy " (Holt), It is well worth read- 
ing by all who admire brave deeds and heroic self- 
sacrifice. There is necessarily much repetition in 
the several sketches of the actors in the one series 
of events, but this detracts little from the interest, 
while it deepens the impressions of patriotic self- 
devotion shown by these great Italians. Young 
people especially should read the book. 

Needed reforms ^^- Parmelee has given us, in his 
in criminal work on " The Principles of Anthro- 

procedure. pology and Sociology in their Rela- 

tions to Criminal Procedure" (Macmillan) a very 
clear and reliable summary of the theories of 
criminology of the Italian School, and especially of 
Lombroso, Garofalo, and Ferri. He has not entirely 
ignored the studies of other modern writers, although 
he has scarcely done justice to American students in 
this field. The central idea of the book is the su- 
perior importance of procedure, as compared with 
the penal code, . He recommends the abolition of the 
lay jury except for political offences ; the appoint- 
ment of trained judges and prosecutors, both to be 
educated in criminology and sociology as well as in 
law ; the indeterminate sentence, with scientific study 
of the criminal at the trial and afterward, with a judi- 
cial board to revise the sentences periodically ; scien- 
tific methods of dealing with evidence, as suggested 
also by Professor MUnsterberg ; and the use of ex- 
perts employed by the state, and not representing 
private parties, during the trial. The discussion is 
in every way strong and clear, and deserves the care- 
ful study of all intelligent citizens. It will help the 
movement represented by many able lawyers to 
secure a wider outlook in social science in the edu- 
cational plans of law schools. Too often ancient 
prejudices have become intrenched in the minds of 
lawyers and judges because they had never studied 
in any laboratory but the law library. 



The period of 
mental virilitv- 



Dr. Osier's thesis — so generally 
misunderstood — still finds a contro- 
versial echo in Mr. W. A, Newman 
Borland's brochure entitled "The Age of Mental 
Virility" (Century Co.). The handling of the 
theme is light, indeed statistically quite inadequate ; 
but the gathering of data of first notable achieve- 



ments, of the period of the magnum optis, of the length 
of productive activity of the world's great workers, 
does leave in its wake a realistic sense of notable 
accomplishment in the later years. All of which 
was generally known, and in this volume may be 
rendered still more familiar. The data as handled 
yield nothing more than illustrative material, and 
do not antagonize the essential import of what Dr. 
Osier had in mind. 



BRIEFE R ME NTION. 

" The Constitutions and Other Select Documents illus- 
trative of the History of France, 1789-1907," by Pro- 
fessor Frank Maloy Anderson, is published by the 
H. W. Wilson Co. This is a revised and greatly en- 
larged edition of a work first published four years ago. 
It belongs to the familiar class of source-books for the 
use of college students of history, and is one of the most 
thorough compilations of its class. French documentary 
material is peculiarly attractive in form, and has no little 
stylistic virtue, wherein it stands in striking contrast to 
English material of the same sort. All of the French 
constitutions are here included, and are given nearly 
intact. Begimiing with the decree creating the National 
Assembly in June, 1789, and ending with a group of 
documents concerning the recent separatiou of Church 
and State, this collection leaves practically nothing to 
be desired by the ordinary student in this most fasci- 
nating field of modern history. 

Joshua Sylvester's translation of the " Sepmaine " of 
Gui Maume de Saluste, Seigneur du Bartos, is chiefly 
known to English readers through its associations with 
Milton, who when a boy was profoundly impressed by 
the poem, and whose " Paradise Lost " shows many 
evidences of his familiarity with this French Protestant 
epic. Even Shakespeare did not scorn, upon occasion, 
to transmute its dross into his gold, and echoes from 
Sylvester may be heard in. many other English poets. 
The student of literary history is, then, considerably 
indebted to the new edition of Sylvester which Mr. 
Theron Wilber Haight has now produced, and which is 
published by Mr. H. M. Youmans, Waukesha, Wisconsin. 
As the only edition published since the Restoration period, 
it is a welcome addition to our apparatus. The volume 
contains the greater part of Sylvester's work, and the 
text is modernized, but discreetly treated in this respect. 
Not the least interesting part of the work is Mr. Haight's 
breezy introduction, which alluringly invites to the text 
that follows. 

A special extra number of The International Studio 
(Lane) is devoted to Augustus Saint-Gaudens and forms 
a handsome tribute to the memory of the first of Ameri- 
can sculptors. Besides a series of photographic repro- 
ductions in half-tone, showing the development of his 
art from his first production to his last, there is a brief 
chronology of his life, a chronological list of his works 
executed during the forty years from 1867 to 1907, 
and an appreciative essay by the English sculptor Mr. 
C. Lewis Hind. Despite the small scale of some of the 
illustrations, it is possible to gain from them a very fair 
idea of the strength and the limitations of Saint-Gaudens. 
In aU that he did the master's fine feeling for the plas- 
tic nature of his material is evident; the treatment is 
always consistently dignified, and marked by careful

avoidance of theatrical effects. A certain quality, best 
described as pictorial, detracts a little from the merit 
of some of his portraits in relief. But in his more im- 
portant productions he rises to the height of imquestion- 
able greatness. The compelling charm of these works 
is keenly felt by Mr. Hind, and his intelligent and 
sympathetic essay is Mrritten under their spell. 



Notes. 



" Buddhism and Immortality," by Mr. William 
Sturgis Bigelow, is the Ingersoll Lecture for 1908, now 
published in a small volume by the Houghton Mifflin Co. 
"Extempore Speaking for School and College," by 
Professor Edwin DuBois Shurter, is a small manual of 
instruction, with illustrations and exercises, published 
by Messrs. Ginn & Co. 

The Linacre Lecture for 1908, having "Thomas 
Linacre " for its subject, was given by Professor 
William Osier, and is now published in book form at 
the Cambridge University Press. 

George Bancroft's official eulogy of Lincoln, pro- 
nounced upon the occasion of the President's death, is 
republished in a small book — " Abraham Lincoln, a 
Tribute " — by the A. Wessels Co. 

" Holland," by Miss Esther Singleton, is published by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. in their " Standard Gal- 
leries " series of art-guides for the tourist. The volume 
has nearly half a hundred full-page illustrations. 

Mr. Ernest Newman has written a critical biography 
of Richard Strauss for the " Living Masters of Music " 
series, published by Mr. John Lane. A personal chap- 
ter is contributed by Mr. Alfred Kalisch, and the book 
has numerous illustrations. 

The latest school-book publications of the American 
Book Co. are the following: "Physics for Secondary 
Schools," by Mr. Charles F. Adams; "Practical Ele- 
mentary Algebra," by Professor Joseph V. Collins; 
"A Punctuation Primer," by Miss Frances M. Perry; 
and " How the World is Clothed," a new geographical 
reader by Mr. Frank G. Carpenter. 

" The International Encyclopedia of Prose and 
Poetical Quotations," compiled by Mr. William S. 
Walsh, is published by the John C. Winston Co. The 
quotations are from upwards of a dozen languages, and 
are classified imder a single alphabetical arrangement. 
The volume is of a thousand pages, is printed on thin 
paper, and is bound in limp leather. 

Miss Cornelia Beare has edited for " Merrill's English 
Texts " G«orge Eliot's " Silas Mamer," and provided 
the introduction and notes customary in the case of such 
school editions. Jane Austen's " Pride and Prejudice " 
is similarly edited by Miss Josephine Woodbury Heer- 
mans, and published (in villainously small type) as a 
" Pocket Classic " by the Macmillan Co. 

Professor Charles J. Bullock's " Introduction to the 
Study of Economics " has been for over ten years one 
of the best of elementary texts upon this essential sub- 
ject of secondary education. The third edition, now 
published by Messrs. Silver, Burdett & Co., is thor- 
oughly revised as to the statistical matter, and has a 
new chapter upon railway transportation. 

The poems of John Ruskin form a new volume in 
"The Muses' Library," published by Messrs. E. P. 
Dutton & Co. The introductory essay by Mr. G. K. 
Chesterton is naturally amusing, but hardly illuminat- 



ing. But the poems are well deserving of a place in 
this series. Although written very early in life, and 
insignificant in comparison with the author's prose, they 
deserve a better fate than oblivion, and we are glad to 
find them made accessible to the public in an inexpen- 
sive form. 

"Principles of Physiology and Hygiene," by Dr. 
G«orge Wells Fitz, is a new school publication of 
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. It is a highly satisfactory 
text for high schools, and its treatment of the moot ques- 
tion of stimulants and narcotics is considerably less offen- 
sive to scientific method than is customary with works 
of this class. The subject is taken by itself, for one 
thing, instead of being impertinently intruded into 
every chapter.

MILTON AS A SCHOOLMASTER 

John Milton was born in London in 1608, just three cen- 
turies ago, his birthday being December 9. One interesting 
and useful recognition of the ter-centenary, which will be 
valued especially by our teachers, is the publication by the 
directors of the Old South work in Boston, as one of their 
large series of Old South Leaflets, of Milton's famous little 
treatise on Education. A most remarkable treatise this was 
for its time.

"HGHTING BOB" EVANS SAYS:

For giving the people a correct idea of their Navy it is invaluable."

" I never realized until the appearance of this book that there was really nothing, up to this time, to give children

"AIX" 



Under this pseudonym there has suddenly appeared a writer, whose name is unknown to 
his publishers, whose style bears no resemblance to that of any living author, and who 
has instantly aroused the curiosity of the highest criticism by applying to modern 
business, politics, and social life in the incomparable 



"Adventures of a Nice Young Man" 

a style of early Georgian purity. The story is one of present day social and business 
adventure, with brief comments on life, manners, business, and public questions. The 
humor and arrangement resemble Fielding, the sentences Goldsmith, and the didactic 
passages Bolingbroke ; though in all the abuse that many of the author's opinions have 
received, he has never incurred the reproach of artificiality. 

Preserved by style and humor this novel is the one that seems destined to hand down to 
a later generation a faithful picture of contemporary manners. The author immediately 
challenges a place in American literature not below that of Washington Irving. 

That this is not conventional publishers' praise is shown by the following comments 
from letters received to be forwarded to the author. 



Mr. GamaKel Bradford, Jr., one of the most 
eminent critics in New England, says, addressing 
"Aix" through his publisher: "How did you 
manage to write about Modern New York in the 
style of Goldsmith and Fielding ? For it is the 
style of Goldsmith and Fielding even to the 
broad words, which some prudery will sniff at. 
You have caught it — the little twists and tiu-ns, 
the admirable self-restraint of touch. I enjoyed 
it exceedingly." 

Professor Walter Morris Hart, of the Univer- 
sity of California, — " ' Aix,' whoever he may be, 
is surely a lineal descendant of Fielding, for he 



has succeeded in reproducing that style in a de- 
gree that I did not think was possible." 

Mr. H. C. Chatfteld-Taylor, the biographer of 
Molifere, says, " To me the story has a peculiar 
charm, caused, I should say, by your picaresque 
touch, your hero being a Lazarillo or a Gil Bias 
in modern dress." 

Horatio S. Krans, the well-known New York 
critic, and the author of the critical biography of 
Goldsmith that introduces the Putnam edition of 
the works of Goldsmith, says, "It is an extra- 
ordinarily presentable work and most pleasantly 
reminiscent of the tone, temper, and manners of 
the eighteenth century novelist," 



FROM THE GENERAL PRESS WE CULL THE FOLLOWING: 



" It has the .picaresque quality which makes Gil 
Bias a joy forever. . . . His comments on life 
and manners with which the book abounds are a 
rare combination of seriousness and lightness." 
— Chicago Inter Ocean. 

" An unusually fine style, a delicate choice of 
words, that makes its reading a pleasure to be 
lingered over." — Boston Globe. 

" A story written after the manner of Gil Bias 
. . . deserves to be widely popular. — Salt Lake 
Tribune. 

" A reminder of Goldsmith, though not in the 
sense of imitation . . . Comes close to being real 
literature . . . May be picked up at any time 
and opened anywhere." — Denver Republican. 



" The staid and simple phrasing of Addisoii's 
' Essays ' or Goldsmith's ' Vicar of Wakefield ' 
. . . whimsical humor." — The Bookman. 

" Curious to read such language in the time of 
the electric light." — The Sun. 

" The literary manners of the eighteenth cen- 
tury brought up to date, and it is great fun, too." 
— Chicago Tribune. 

" That homely style of narrative which is the es- 
sence of literary art. • . . The old time style com- 
bined with a modem setting." — Evening Wisconsin. 

" The new author has literary gifts of no com- 
mon kind. — St. Louis Globe-Democrat. 

" An air of Roderick Random . . . directness,

$6.00, net. 

Mr. Binyon puts forward his volume with the modest hope that it " may 
not be thought too presumptuous an attempt to survey the achievement 
and to interpret the aims of Oriential painting and to appreciate it from the 
standpoint of a European in relation to the rest of the the world's art." It 
is the general student and lover of painting he has wished to interest.

*•* A series of eight lectures on architecture. delivered in the Royal Acad- 
emy. The first four lectures deal with the study of architecture — its rela- 
tion to personal temperament, its appeal to the emotions and its limitations.

his conception of the aims and ideas of architecture by reference to great 
examples of the art in the past.

220. $2.00, net. 

" The work professes nothing more than to furnish a sketch of the lives 
of two men of opposite tastes and pursuits, brought into intimate relation- 
ship by the force of circumstances. They were both good men and honest 
anglers ; the first was a fisher of Men, the second an angler of Fish. Thomas 
Ken was but nine years old when Izaac Walton married his half-sister, and 
it was doubtless under Walton's roof that much of the boyhood of Ken was 
passed." — The Author.

In Old Ceylon 



By REGINALD PARRAR, Author of " The 
Garden of Asia." With 16 full-page Illus- 
trations. 8vo, pp. xii-351. $4.00. 
The book has little concern with modem 
Ceylon, its industries and exports; it tells 
rather of the bygone glories and sanctities of 
ancient Lanka, when the island was the seat 
of a powerful monarchy and dominant church. 
The interest of the book is not wholly anti- 
quation and historic however, for Ceylon is a 
vast flowering garden, of whose blossoms and 
paradises all votaries of horticulture will de- 
light to read .

" Where Mr. Briggs has fished in Scotland

In two volumes. 8vo, pp. 359+388. $8.50, net. 
This is a book of interest from various 
points of view, religious, political, and adven- 
turous. It will appeal to the Churchman and 
the philanthropist ; and to the politician as a 
chapter of Empire-building, in which the 
author himself has played no small part. The 
Bishop describes with pencil and brush as well 
as with the pen his wanderings, mostly afoot, 
through nearly 2000 miles of tropical Africa.

ROSS, Authors of " Some Experiences of 
an Irish R.M.," etc. With 35 Illustra- 
tions by E. CE. Somerville. Crown 8vo, 
pp. viii-315. $1.50. 

"... A book to be hailed with joy. 
The authors are lavish in the entertain- 
ment that they furnish. The magistrate, the 
central figure of the narrative, is a long- 
suffering individual, and his "experiences" 
might have reduced a man of less vigorous 
mentality to a pessimistic state of mind — to 
put it mildly. But the Major is blessed with 
the Irish sense of humor, and sad indeed is 
the happening from which he cannot extract 
a fund of amusement. Many of the inctdents 
are highly diverting, and they are given a set- 
ting entirely worthy of them. The book is 
well illustrated."— iV^ei<;a»-fc Evening News.

By AUSTIN BRERETON. With 1 Photogravure, 22 Collotype Plates, and 23 other Dlustrations. 

2 vols. 8vo, pp. 401+374. $6.50, net. 

This is the authoritative biography of the great actor-manager. It tells the history of his career from 
his birth to his death, and it contains a large amount of material which will be entirely new to the public. 
Of that material some was supplied to the author by Sir Henry himself, and much of it is taken from 
original documents. The numerous illustrations include a fine, and hitherto unpublished, photograph of 
Sir Henry Irving, taken shortly before his death. 

Memorials of Two Sisters, Susanna and 
Catherine Winkworth 

Edited by their Niece. MARGARET J. SH AEN. With 2 Photogravure 

Portraits. 8vo, pp. xvi-341. S3.50, net. 

Catherine was the translator of the famous collection of hymns known 
as " Lyra Germanica." Susanna Winkworth was the translator of several 
important works by Baron Bunsen, but her best known work in this direc- 
tion was that of the " Theologia Germanica," which was issued in 1854, with 
a preface by Charles Kingsley, 

The greater part of the book is composed of letters from the two sisters 
to members of their family circle and others. These letters deal with the 
literary and religious interests of their lives, and only deal incidentally 
with family and private matters. Letters are also given from various 
friends — such as Maurice, James Martineau, Baron Bunsen, Mazzini, and 
Charlotte Bronte, and in these and other letters glimpses are given of many 
well-known and interesting persons. 

Madame Elizabeth De France

Treasures." With 14 Photogravure Portraits and other Illustrations,

and McGill University, Montreal), etc. With 160 Illustrations, some of 
which are colored. 8vo, pp. x-537. $6.00, net. 

This book is the outcome of twenty years' work. In it is put forth a 
theory of the origin of vertebrates, which is based upon two fundamental 
propositions, (1) that the essential factor for the upward evolution of all 
animals is growth of brain power, (2) that each higher group of animals has 
arisen from some member of the highest group evelved up to that time and 
not from a lower group.

Lady Holland is known to readers of me-

whose social and literary accomplishments 
drew to her house the wits, the politicians, 
and the " corjnoscenti" of the day. As yet, 
however, little has been written of her earlier 
years, and on these her Journal will throw 
much light. i

AN IMPORTANT SERIES FOR THE 
CONSIDERATION OF PARENTS 

WE ask the special attention of parents, librarians, teachers, and book- 
sellers to the twenty volumes now ready in this series. The selection 
of these titles has been made from a list of several thousand books now existing 
in what is known in Germany as the "Jugend Biliothek," which comprises 
books for the young on every subject of knowledge. There is nothing else 
quite like this series available in English, and we cannot recommend the books 
too heartily for placing in the hands of young readers. The translations 
have been made by Mr. George P. Upton, whose rendering of Max Miiller's 
" Memories " has established his ability to convey to the English reader the 
finest distinctions of the German original, and we have issued the books in a 
simple inexpensive form. They can be had either singly or grouped as desired, 
and we shall be glad to send to any librarian, teacher, or responsible member 
of a reading circle board a free sample copy for examination.

Reminiscences of Scottish Life 

and Character 

THE favorable reception which has continuously been given to these 
Reminiscences since their first appearance a little more than fifteen 
years ago, at home, in America, in India, and in all countries where 
Scotchmen are to be found, warrants this new edition. This work was 
undertaken to depict a phase of national manners which was fast passing 
away, and social customs and habits of thought, characteristic of the race, 
are illustrated by a copious application of anecdotes. The special feature of 
this new edition is the set of beautiful colored illustrations of characters and

A BEAUTIFUL NEW EDITION OF

Studies of the XVIIIth Century in Italy 

IN this beautiful volume the publishers offer what they believe to be one of the most appropriate 
settings of any classic that has ever been presented to booklovers. To speak at any length of 
the book itself is unnecessary, as the essays it contains have long held a position of their own 
in Hterature. It will be recalled, however, that some of the studies are literary in character, 
taking up such writers as Goldoni and Carlo Gozzi, and some musical, discussing the composers of 
that period. For this new edition the author has prepared a most interesting preface, and 
Dr. Guido Biagi, of the Laurentian Library, has himself selected the forty rare and most interesting 
illustrations with which the volume is adorned. This includes a notable photogravure frontispiece 
from a portrait of Domenico Annibali. The book has been beautifully printed from large clear 
type on exceptional paper, and an especially rich effect is produced by the decorated border on the 
title and half-title pages, printed in silver. Altogether this superb edition deserves the careful 
attention of all those who wish to add to their libraries a beautiful example of book-making and a 
volume of permanent interest.

There is always a large circle of readers waiting for each of her new books as it

An Epic Poem on Lincoln 

THE BURDEN BEARER 
By FRANCIS HOWARD WILLIAMS 

Limited to 300 numbered copies, 8vo, 200 pages, printed on hand-made deckel 
edge paper, and bound in half vellum, stamped in gold. 

Price $2.50 net per copy 

If sent by mail, postage will be 15 cents per copy additional 

CRITICS who have read the epic declare that it is a worthy tribute to the man who for 
four weary years was the nation's burden bearer ; and that its publication is destined 
to be a noteworthy event in literary circles. 

Absolute simplicity is the keynote of the poem, as it was the leading principle in 
Lincoln's life. The author has been impressed with the fact that he could hope to main- 
tain that dignity which the subject demands only by avoiding the temptation to verbal 
elaboration and undue imagery. 

The poem is written in divers measures, the purely narrative portions being in blank 
verse and the more dramatic crises and battle pieces in meters varying with the atmosphere 
of the occasion. For the Emancipation episode the Spenserian stanza is employed, and 
the ballad and ode forms are used to give further variety to a work which seeks historic 
accuracy while avoiding prosaic statement of fact.

MAGAZINE WRITING and the NEW LITEBA- 
TURE. By Henry Mills Alden — forty years editor of 
Harper's Magazine. From the outlook of a half-century 
of close association with literature, Mr. Alden has been 
singularly able to discern the forces that have been at work 
during that period, and to bring them forward with a rare 
personal touch. That part of the book which relates to 
magazine writing is really an account of the important 
influence of periodicals upon general literature. 8vo,

THE SPEAKING VOICE. By Kathebine Jewell 
Everts. So far from being a mere discourse on elocution, 
this is a vavacious, familiar discussion of the proper manage- 
ment of the voice in ordinary conversation. The author, a 
well-known teacher of vocal culture, gives plain directions 
for overcoming common defects of speech, especially that 
hardness and shrillness of intonation to which Americans 
are said to be peculiarly prone. The exercises recommended 
are so simple and natural that any one can follow them with- 
out trouble. Post 8vo, cloth Net, $1.00

THE AGE OF SHAKESPEARE. By Algernon 
Charles Swinburne. This volume of prose by Swinburne 
is marked by every felicity of his thought and style, and it 
will reveal at once a new as well as the old Swinburne to

critical and illuminative, devoting themselves to Shake- 
speare and the writers of his time. This flowering period of 
English letters has never before been treated as Swinburne 
does it here. Crown Svo, gilt top Net, $2.00 

WOMEN, Etc. By George Harvey. These essays treat 
of a brilliant variety of subjects, from the right of woman 
to "enhance nature's charms" to her right to vote. They 
are characterized by a shrewd insight into human nature 
and affairs, by a typically American sense of the droll, by a 
peculiarly appreciative consciousness of the foible of women 
and some men, and by a delightful tone of ironic wit. Post

THE STORY OF A STREET. By Frederick Trevor 
Hill. The genuine story of Wall Street from the time when 
Wilhelmus Kieft, the Dutch Governor of New Amsterdam, 
roughly marked its direction with a cattle-guard of felled 
trees and brushwood, to the latest period of its development. 
Wall Street in the days of the Dutch, Wall Street during the 
Revolution, Wall Street in later times as the centre of govern- 
ment, as the social centre, as the centre of finance — the 
author traces all its strange transformations in his brilliant 
allusive style, mingling humorous anecdote with the historic 
narrative. It reads like a wonderful story. Illustrated.

High Calling of Maternity" — these are but a

And yet the treatment is not dry— not didac-

This is a 
Beautiful Present

The artistic gray 
green and white binding 
will appeal to her aesthetic

her sentiments, and even though she cannot 
agree with all the opinions of the author, she 
will at least be interested in them, and flat- 
tered by your selecting a work of such distinctly 
feminine interest.

DIAPHANOUS LITERATURE. 



An old protest, but one that cannot be voiced 
too often, is again made in a recent article by 
Mr. Frederic Harrison, whose powers of clear 
thinking and cogent reasoning have done so 
much, in so many directions, to keep our gen- 
eration in the paths of sanity. Whatever Mr. 
Harrison's theme may be, — ethics, politics, 
philosophy, or aesthetics — he has a way of 
striking at its heart, or of penetrating as with 
shafts of clear sunshine the obscuring mists of 
verbiage or sentimentalism that have gathered 
around it. The text with which he now pro- 
vides us is the following : 

" It is too much the fashion of our day to require in 
poetry a subtle involution of thought, cryptic parables, 
the ' curious felicity ' — or rather the laborious ' curi- 
osity ' — of precious phrase, such as may rival the 
ambiguity of a double acrostic in a lady's journal. 
There are some who will hardly count anything poetry 
unless it need many a re-reading to unravel its inner 
connotations. And for the sake of this subtlety, or 
rather as a hall-mark of this superfine ' mentality ' as 
they call it in their jargon, they desiderate an uncouth- 
ness of diction, or at least a sputtering cacophony of 
strident discords, that would ' have made Quintilian 
stare and gasp.' For my part, I have no taste for 
commdrums rhymed or unrhymed. I will read no 
poetry that does not tell me a plain tale in honest words, 
with easy rhythm and pure music? 

If this personal declaration were to become an 
accepted canon of appreciation on the part of 
intelligent readers in general, there would be a 
wholesome housecleaning of literary premises 
everywhere. Such a consummation would, no 
doubt, leave many a scribbler with his occu- 
pation gone, but it would make most wonder- 
fully for strength and vitality in the world of 
letters. 

Even in this twentieth century, we are still 
harvesting the aftermath of the romantic spirit, 
and with it many weeds of adventitious origin. 
Often, we do not get even the iridescent color- 
ing of romanticism, for which it is easy to make 
allowance, but dull obscurity and the fuliginous 
darkening of counsel. Even those of the clear- 
est powers of vision wilfully hide their light, 
while their feeble imitators, who have no light 
to hide, don the concealing robes, and wear 
them with so impressive a pose that many are 
deluded into taking the wearers for prophets of 
authentic lineage. The trick of mystification 
is readily learned, and many a masquerader, 
vacuous of real intellectual substance, gets a fol-

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



lowing by adept practice of the arts of charlatan- 
ism. In a certain sense, such unquestionably 
great writers as Carlyle and Browning and 
Meredith are responsible for the straining and 
preciosity that infect so much of our current 
literary production. It is their example that 
gives vogue to so many of our word-mongers in 
prose and verse. These men need no manner- 
isms to buttress the solid structure of their 
thought, for without mannerisms they would 
be equally great and equally individual ; but 
what is with them the accident is too often mis- 
taken for the essence by their would-be copyists, 
and is found to be easily imitable. " Words 
without thoughts never to Heaven go," but it 
is too frequently the case that they may have a 
fairly successful life upon earth, and work much 
mischief before their force is spent. 

With this mischief in the world of practical 
affairs we are not here concerned. The dema- 
gogue, the philosophaster, and the yellow journal- 
ist make it a-plenty, and the evil that they do 
lives after them, besides being patent in the 
present. It is to the mischief done in the do- 
main of art, and particularly of literary art, 
that attention is now directed. From the use 
of words for the concealment of thought to their 
use for the concealment of its absence is an easy 
step, and one that seems to be taken by extra- 
ordinary numbers of writers at the present time. 
How else should the voracious printing-presses 
be fed with " copy," or the artless public get its 
intellectual breakfast-food ? The appetite of the 
masses may, of course, be served with common- 
place thoughts and sentiments garnished with 
the tissue-paper ornaments of commonplace 
rhetoric, and their case has thus been disposed 
of in all ages. But just above the level of the 
masses there is a stratum of readers who de- 
mand some touch of distinction in the product 
set before them. Fortunately, a sham distinc- 
tion is sufficient for their needs, and they think 
brummagem quite as good as gold. These give 
to the pretentious writer, who has nothing to 
say but many ingenious ways of saying it, the 
opportunity for which he has been seeking, and 
he sets bravely out to win with his pen the 
plaudits that may be thus cheaply got. 

Among his methods are the employment of 
tortuous constructions that have to be puzzled 
out, and bold ellipses that permit several guesses 
for each meaning. Sometimes he acquires a 
reputation for great subtlety of thought by the 
use of qualifying clauses, and puts so many of 
them into a sentence that when it is ended one 
wonders what it started out to say. Sometimes 



he indulges in reckless figurative language that 
he may be credited with great powers of imag- 
ination. Still, again, he darkly hints that his 
writing is symbolical, and wiU reveal a precious 
inner significance to those who penetrate its 
verbal veil. This is a particularly fetching 
trick, because anybody can find symbols in 
anything by looking hard enough, so each 
investigator may feel sure that he has discovered 
the right ones, and admire his own acumen with 
all the naive satisfaction of an intellectual Jack 
Horner. Finally, if all these devices fail to 
bring the writer a following, he may resort to 
paradox, for paradox, if only startling enough, 
is unfailingly effective. Let him deny all self- 
evident propositions as a matter of principle, 
declare the wildest of absurdities to be the most 
obvious of truths, turn all current ideas topsy- 
turvy, posing throughout as the one normal 
thinker in a mad world, and he will soon enjoy 
a very pretty reputation as a philosopher. 
Examples of how the thing has been done will 
come to the mind of every reader of current 
fashionable literature. 

The general case which we have been seek- 
ing to characterize was diagnosed long ago by 
Schopenhauer, whose words fit present-day con- 
ditions with singular accuracy. Mediocre writers 
are much the same in aU times and countries. 

" They say what they have to say in long sentences 
that wind about in a forced and unnatural way; they 
coin new words aud write prolix periods which go round 
and round the thought and wrap it up in a sort of dis- 
guise. They tremble between the two separate aims of 
communicating what they want to say aud of concealing 
it. Their object is to dress it up so that it may look 
learned or deep, in order to give people the impression 
that there is very much more in it than for the moment 
meets the eye." 

We fancy that many a showy reputation of our 
own day would shrink noticeably, or crumble to 
pieces altogether, if subjected to the tests sug- 
gested by this incisive passage. 

The kind of writing to which our attention 
has above been devoted is anything but diapha- 
nous, and the title of our article is clearly a mis- 
nomer unless it may be justified by invoking the 
law of association by contrast. It came to us 
from Landor by way of Professor Ker, whose 
words upon the Icelandic sagas we wish now to 

quote. 

« There is nothing equal to them anywhere for their 
power of recording life. To use the words of Landor 
about his own poems, they are not prismatic, but diapha- 
nous; those who look into them can see through. One 
looks through into the tenth century, into the thirteenth, 
one sees men there, not as < trees walking'; one hears 
their conversation, not muffled in a learned language 
(like so many good things in Giralddus Cambrensis and 



1908.]

Matthew Paris), not dressed up with rhetoric, not para- 
phrased or otherwise cooked, but their very words. It 
is true, and fortunately true, that good memoirs are com- 
mon in all times and languages. But nowhere are things 
seen, and heard, so clearly as in the Icelandic stories." 

Life was simple in the days of which those 
stories were told, and it is highly complex in 
ours. Probably it is impossible for us now to 
recover the magical simplicity of the sagaman's 
art, but it is surely not unprofitable to hark 
back to it, and to seek to learn something from 
its example. 



THE CASE OF FICTION. 

It was only the other day that criticism began to 
take prose fiction seriously, but it has done its best 
to make up for lost time. The universities offer 
courses in the novel ; grave doctors discourse of its 
origin and development. It is not strange that note- 
worthy discoveries have ensued with regard to its 
scope and function. Prose fiction is, we now learn, 
the one art or achievement upon which our material 
age may rightly plume itself. It is pretty well 
agreed that in other fields the last word had been 
said before the modern race of men came into being ; 
the gift of prose narrative being our one natal gift. 
To be sure, there had been some sort of prose fic- 
tion before Richardson, before Boccaccio even; some- 
body once wrote a story of Ruth with a hand not far 
from masterly. But it is only our own age which 
could have produced an " Adam Bede " or a " Peau 
de Chagrin." 

But there is a tendency to go even farther than 
this, to fancy that fiction is about to supersede cer- 
tain older forms of literary art, such as narrative 
poetry and the drama ; and, mirabile dictu, this not 
by virtue of a decadence of the general taste, but 
by fairly defeating them on their own ground. A 
recent writer begins his elaborate discussion of 
English prose fiction with this astonishing state- 
ment : " Shakespeare did not remark that it [Lyly's 
Euphues] marked the genesis of a new kind of 
literature which was destined to usurp the place 
of acted drama. ... To find plots for his drama, 
Shakespeare ransacked the Italian novelists, with- 
out perceiving that Boccaccio and Bandello had 
invented a form of art capable of expressing all the 
passions of human nature not less successfully than 
the drama itself." Are we really ready to assent 
to this? Can we quite pit a Balzac against a 
Shakespeare? Is the novel as pure a medium for 
the higher imagination as the play? Is it, at all 
events, as pure a medium as the narrative poem, the 
true epic? Or do we lay that flattering unction to 
our souls because prose fiction is the tool to which 
our hand is now best fitted ? — because above all, to 
the mass of us to-day the novel virtually is litera- 
ture? No doubt immense progress has been made 
during the past century in the technical handling 
of this graphic literary mode ; yet the relation of 



prose fiction to other forms of literature has under- 
gone no discoverable change : it is the attitude of 
the authorities that has changed. " It confers a cer- 
tain dignity upon the study of fiction," says a recent 
critic, "to remember how universal is the appetite 
for fiction." Precisely : human beings have always 
been listening for the story ; but we need not there- 
fore discuss Hall Caine in terms of Shakespeare or 
of Homer. Prose fiction has not yet proved itself 
equal or comparable to poetic fiction. It is an unfor- 
tunate tendency of the day to confuse the boundaries 
of prose and poetry, to attribute to one the functions 
of the other. It may not have been a surprise to 
hear that sensitive enthusiast, Sidney Lanier, declar- 
ing that "in the novel we have the meeting, the 
reconciliation, the kiss, of science and poetry." But 
which way were we to look when so cool a critic as 
the late Sir Leslie Stephen asserted that " A novel- 
ist is on the border-line between poetry and prose, 
and novels should be, as it were, saturated with 
poetry " ? The truth underlying the remark is 
clearly that the best fiction demands a high exercise 
of the imagination. But is it the same thing as the 
poetic imagination ? To speak of a novel saturated 
with poetry is like speaking of water saturated with 
sunlight. The water seems to contain the light, but 
remains itself, and is at best a defective vehicle for 
that celestial visitant. 

People did not hold these vague notions a few 
generations ago. If anybody ever wrote English 
prose which seemed to be saturated with poetry, it 
was DeQuincey. Certainly he himself discovered 
no promise of sublimity in the fiction of his day. 
" To be a reader," he wrote sixty years ago, " is 
no longer that honorary distinction which once it 
might have been amongst a more elevated, because 
more select, body of readers. ... A writer of 
to-day, either in France or England, to be very 
popular must be a story-teller — which is a function 
of literature neither very noble in itself, nor, sec- 
ondly, tending to permanence." A cavalier and 
old-fashioned way of disposing of the great modern 
art ! But the kibe of the man of letters was then 
freshly galled by the advance of the popular story- 
teller. It is a favorite theory of a later observer, 
Mr. Andrew Lang, that Walter Scott's success 
really marked the beginning of the end of serious 
reading on the part of the general. At the height 
of Scott's first fame Carlyle had prophesied over 
him in a notable passage. " Literature," he cries, 
" has other aims than that of harmlessly amusing 
indolent men. . . . There is nothing to be sought 
or found in the Waverley Novels. Not profitable 
for doctrine, for reproof, for edification, for building 
up or elevating, in any shape. The sick heart wUl 
find no healing here, the darkly-struggling heart no 
guidh,nce: the Heroic that is in all men no divine 
awakening voice. We say, therefore, that they do 
not found themselves on deep interests, but on com- 
paratively trivial ones; not on the perennial, per- 
haps not even on the lasting." This is doctrine 
sterner than many of us would subscribe to. We

seem to have found some of these things in Scott; 
we seem to find him as lasting, at least, as his 
censor. Yet we cannot defend him from the real 
charge — that he fails in the test of supreme great- 
ness. He worked magic with that rushing pen, but 
the wizard of the North was after all only a wizard. 
There was no deep poetic faculty in him, and he 
remains in the end, to use Carlyle's pitiless phrase, 
the great Restaurateur. It may reasonably be con- 
tended that the writer of fiction who sticks to his 
last can hardly achieve greater success than this — 
to be a great Restaurateur. In the modern novel 
the genius of narrative often finds himself among 
strange bedfellows, exponents of political, religious, 
or social theory, who crowd him to the wall and 
well-nigh smother him in their discourse. But the 
divine awakening voice is not to be heard, for it is 
the voice of poetry, and a very different matter 
from the pleasant or busy voice of prose fiction. 
We may well remember that while the appetite for 
fiction has always been universal, the appetite for 
prose fiction is a creation of yesterday. And it can 
do us no harm to listen, now and again, to some 
such abrupt dictum as that which the late Churton 
Collins uttered, quite without apology : " Popular 
fiction moves in a sphere of its own. It has its own 
public and its own fortunes ; with serious literature 
it has no influential connection."

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A POPULAR ANNUAL PERIODICAL is the never- 
failing almanac, which makes its yearly appearance 
on the news-stands about this time, as a reminder 
that another twelvemonth has nearly fled and a new 
one is about to begin. The word " almanac " is of 
uncertain derivation, but probably from the Arabic. 
The thing it denotes is of great antiquity, \he fasti 
of the old Romans being a crude sort of almanac, 
and the printed calendar as we now know it being 
almost as old as the art of printing. Taking ad- 
vantage of the fascination of the inscrutable, almanac- 
makers early besprinkled the pages of their annual 
productions with all sorts of prognostications, not 
merely concerning the weather and the convulsions 
of nature, but also regarding occurrences of pecul- 
iar, local, and even personal interest. So mischiev- 
ous, in fact, did these pretended prophecies prove 
themselves in France that as early as 1579 they 
were forbidden by royal decree. The pages of 
Italian almanacs are sprightly and amusing by 
reason of their inter jectional comments on the 
weather. Turning to the date July 30, one may 
read, for example, " Sudano ancora le ossa ! " ^ven 
the bones sweat) ; and exclamations abound like 
" Oh, what an insufferable heat ! " " My birthright 
for a mantle of morning dew ! " " The foul fiend 
take this stifling sirocco ! " The first American 
almanac is said to have been published by William 



Pierce of Cambridge in 1639, while the most famous 
one was undoubtedly " Poor Richard's Almanac," 
which Franklin began to issue in 1732 and con- 
tinued for about twenty-five years. " The Ameri- 
can Almanac," of about 1828-60, afterwards revived 
by the late Ainsworth R. Spofford for a number of 
years, is also familiar to those interested in such 
things. "The New England Almanac" (1775- 
1817) of Isaiah Thomas, the famous Boston printer, 
and " The Old Farmer's Almanac " of Robert B. 
Thomas (also a Boston printer), now in its 117th 
year, are likewise historic. The voluminous and 
miscellaneously instructive newspaper almanacs are 
to-day well-nigh numberless.

The reference librarian's arduous task 
calls for more than scholarship and sympathy and 
tact and training ; it demands powers of divination, 
of mind-reading, a Sherlock-Holmes keenness of 
observation and unerring shrewdness of inference. 
The applicant for aid from the reference librarian 
may not, and often does not know exactly what he 
wants ; but that is no excuse for languid service on 
the librarian's part. He should know the appli- 
cant's mind better than does the applicant himself ; 
he should skip nimbly and noiselessly hither and 
yon in cheerful quest of just the right books or 
pamphlets or maps or prints to meet the require- 
ments of the case ; and he should at last send the 
satisfied applicant away swelling with new knowl- 
edge and beaming with self-satisfaction. In a late 
number of the Indiana " Library Occurrent " is a 
short article on " Reference Work " from the pen 
of the Michigan City librarian, who thus presents 
the ideal to be aimed at by the person in charge of 
this work : " Upon finding out what the reader really 
wants, and that is a difiicult and painstaking process 
at times, the librarian should be able to size up the 
information-seeker and know immediately whether 
he is a dictionary man or whether, perhaps, he 
might not be an encyclopedia man, and, what is still 
better and will bring joy to the heart of the usually 
discouraged librarian of a small library, he may be 
a real student and want everything to be had on the 
subject. In order to give the right book to the right 
man, the librarian must be perfectly familiar with 
the character of the material in the different books, 
and this means work." Yes, indeed — hard work ; 
reading and remembering the contents of some five 
hundred volumes a day would make a man a very 
fair reference librarian by the time death overtook 
him at his task. But this is a world of remote 
approximations, and we have to be satisfied with 
less perfectly equipped reference librarians.

Pragmatism at Oxford appears to be shaking 
the philosophical structure of that University to its 
foundations. An Oxford graduate who is now 
pursuing philosophical studies at Harvard recently 
sounded a note of alarm in an able and interesting 
paper read at the opening meeting of Professor 



1908.] 



THE DIAI.

Royce's Seminary. His essay, entitled '' The Present 
State of Philosophical Study at Oxford," concluded 
with this significant paragraph : " In the summer of 
this year Professor James gave a course of lectures 
in Oxford. Those lectures were of a character to 
which Oxford is unaccustomed, and (this is the point) 
of a kind quite out of harmony with Oxford's tradi- 
tional mode of philosophical teaching. Yet Professor 
James had the largest audience which Oxford has 
probably ever seen at a philosophical lecture. It 
was a singular event ; and many wondered whether 
it marked the beginning of a new era, and, if so, how 
much of the old way, so highly valued and so long 
cherished, would be likely before long to remain . . . 
For myself, I feel that, as far as Oxford and her 
purpose are concerned, there never can be any way 
better than the one so long in use, which I believe 
will survive all present unrest and dissatisfaction." 
This is not the place to discuss the merits of rival 
philosophies, but even the most cursory backward 
glance at the germination, growth, and decay of 
system after system of philosophical belief ought to 
inspire a reasonable certainty that the universe can 
withstand the strain of yet another change in this 
respect. That gasping sense of dismay which inevi- 
tably accompanies the wrenching away of old props 
and buttresses is indescribably awful, to be sure, but 
one nearly always recovers breath a little later.

The national note in literature may be a 
grand and a stirring note, but it is not the note of 
strongest and most universal appeal. Mr. Bliss 
Perry, in his address the other day at the seventy- 
first anniversary of the founding of Mt. Holyoke 
Seminary (now Mt. Holyoke College), deplored the 
absence of this national note in our literature as if it 
were the one desideratum required to make that litera- 
ture truly great. Speaking particularly of poetry, he 
said : " The body of tolerably acceptable contemporary 
verse is enormous. It shows a wide range of thought 
and a commendable technique. In one department, 
at least, it has manifested a notable progress during 
the past five years, namely, in the poetic drama. 
Yet how rarely in the mass of lyric verse does one 
catch the national note ! More sonnets are written 
about John Keats than about the United States of 
America." The greatest poets, however, and prose 
writers too, have addressed themselves to no nation, 
but to all mankind. It is love rather than patriotism 
that takes up the harp of life and smites on all the 
chords with might. The national note in literature 
is too often the provincial note, and seldom gives 
the highest pleasure except as touched involuntarily 
and unconsciously, and when heard as the undertone 
to themes of perennial and universal significance. 
• • • 

The cosmopolitanism of our best authors 
cannot be disputed. They strike, not the national 
note, but the international, or even the interplanet- 
ary. In a published interview with Mr. W. J. Locke, 
the English novelist now visiting our shores, he is 
reported as exclaiming, when Mr. Howells, Mr. 



Henry James, and Mark Twain were mentioned 
as of our country : " What, are they Americans ? 
You really bring me up with a jerk when you claim 
these writers as Americans. Howells is a household 
word with us in England. As for Mark Twain, he 
is not American, surely ; he belongs to the whole 
Anglo-Saxon race. I remember when I was a boy 
of fourteen I had learned his story of ' The Jump- 
ing Frog' by heart. Every Englishman knows 
him, and we consider that he belongs to us quite as 
much as to you. And then, as you say, there is 
Henry James ; after all, is he not literally quite as 
much an Englishman as he is an American ? He 
lives in England . . . and he stands very highly 
with us, especially in his earlier novels, which are 
decidedly and deservedly popular." Years ago it 
used to be scornfully asked in England, Who ever 
reads an American book ? Now it might rather be 
asked, Who ever fails to read a good American 
book, or in reading it stops to think of its being 

American ?

" Born in the purple " is a fine phrase and a 
coveted attribute of one's origin. But by no stress of 
retroactive exertion, by no utmost zeal in pedigree- 
chasing, has it hitherto seemed possible to make 
oneself of purple birth when that birth was just 
common green or gray or straw-color or drab. 
Now, however, all that is changed, and if the 
benevolent scheme of certain gentlemen at present 
consulting together in London is carried out, any 
American (or almost any American) with a certain 
modest sum in his pocket will be able to throw a 
purple glow about his cradle and to feel himself for- 
ever after a scion of chiefs and monarchs. In other 
words, an American "Almanach de Gotha" is un- 
der contemplation, to be called "American Purple," 
and to contain the names of all those whose pride 
of birth, when properly touched, will respond — to 
the tune of $7.50 (which entitles the proud one to 
a free copy of the book, post-paid). What imper- 
tinent rhymester shall ever again dare say of our 
purple-born : 

" A bridge across a hundred years, 
Without a prop to save it from sneers — 
Not even a couple of rotten peers — 
A thing for laughter, fleers, and jeers, 
Is American aristocracy."

Conservatism and caution in spelling- 
reform appears to be the watchword of the recently 
organized band of orthography-menders in England. 
They have established dignified and appropriate 
headquarters across the street from the British 
Museum, and have as their president no less a light 
in linguistics than Professor Skeat, and as secretary 
Mr. William Archer. " What is needed, and what 
we plan to arrange," this latter official is reported 
as saying on a recent occasion, " is an international 
commission of experts to consider the situation and 
report on it. After receiving their report we shall 
be in a position to draw up a plan of campaign, and

whether this movement, now only tentative, is a 
good and useful one. If it prove, as we believe it 
will, a boon and a blessing not only to children but 
to the whole community, it will gradually ' catch 
on ' and oust the old unreason. It will be, in fact, 
a case of the survival of the fittest." There is good 
sense in that. Festina lente is the best of mottoes 
for spelling-reform associations, and our cousins 
across the water, refusing to be stampeded in this 
matter by anyone in high civil station, have evi- 
dently adopted it. ... 

The jargon of literary criticism, like every 
other system of nomenclature, tends to become, 
through much use, worn and slippery and vague. 
Terms not originally synonymous are interchanged, 
and thus precision and clearness are always demand- 
ing the coining of new words or the borrowing and 
adaptation of words from other fields of learning. 
As an example of the manner in which a term may 
degenerate from the sharply specific into the vaguely 
general, let us quote from a review of " Diana 
Mallory " in a leading London literary weekly. 
" At the risk of being thought meticulous," says the 
reviewer, "we may be allowed to express surprise 
that so accurate a writer as Mrs. Ward should have 
gone out of her way to say that Sir James Chide 
was as ' innocent of books as Lord Palmerston.' " 
Surely, if the word meticulous (from Latin mettis, 
fear ; hence, fearful, timid) has so lost all definite- 
ness that it can be used instead of pedantic or over- 
particular, it is time it were thrown back into the 
melting-pot and its place taken by a bright, new, 
freshly minted, and clearly stamped piece of verbal 
coinage. . , , 

The " Pseudonyms " are a quiet little society of 
English librarians that may in a sense be likened to 
our own " Bibliosmiles," a little conclave of choice 
and congenial souls gathered by mutual attraction 
out of the ranks of American library workers. The 
" Pseudonyms " appear to be as little fettered by 
constitution and by-laws as are the " Bibliosmiles." 
They meet semi-occasionally in an informal way and 
discuss, informally, subjects of literary and library 
interest, or any topic whatever that happens to pro- 
voke discussion. Each member is at perfect liberty 
to air his views freely, and if opinions clash, so much 
the better. The society is described by current 
report as a secret society, meeting and dining in 
Soho, but not suspected of cherishing any treason- 
able, nihilistic, or anarchistic designs. So heartily 
enjoyable are its "evenings at home" that an invi- 
tation to one of them is prized by the lucky outsider.

"The clown of the newspaper establish- 
ment," as the Boston " Herald " fittingly denom- 
inates the motley-clad comic supplement to the 
Sunday issue, has been discontinued by that leading 
New England journal; and it is to be hoped that 
its lead will have a numerous following. Public 
protest is not ineffectual in such matters ; and as 
soon as the makers of Sunday newspapers are con- 



vinced that the people are weary of this particular 
form of ugliness and inanity, they will vie with one 
another in their promptness to suppress it. We 
heartily agree with the " Herald " when it says that 
" comic supplements have ceased to be comic. They 
have become as vulgar in design as they are tawdry 
in color. There is no longer any semblance of art 
in them, and if there are any ideals they are low 
and descending lower." In the not too distant 
future it is to be hoped that the art of illustrating 
in color will become truly a fine art, and that the 
possessor of even a nickel may purchase some of its 
benefits ; but until then, let the Sunday newspaper 
put its paint-pot away and resume the sober garb of 
an earlier, more self-respecting age.

A THIRTY years' EPISTOLARY FRIENDSHIP, if One 

may so name it, was maintained between the late 
Charles Eliot Norton and Leslie Stephen. The two 
could have seen little of each other, and must rarely 
have had the pleasure of clasping each other's hands ; 
for they were home-loving men, and they lived three 
thousand miles apart. But their correspondence was 
regular and frequent, and Stephen's last days are 
said to have been especially cheered by those wel- 
come letters from Cambridge. As Mr. Sidney Lee 
has taken timely occasion to point out, there are but 
few examples in literary annals of so warm a friend- 
ship kept alive so long by the interchange of letters. 
The lovableness of Norton's nature receives no better 
testimony than Lowell's affectionate letters to him 
from abroad. Studied and self-conscious in too much 
of his published correspondence, the poet of Elm- 
wood could let himself go in writing to his " Ciarli " — 
as he liked to spell the name, in Italianized form. The 
letters, too, that he wrote to Stephen are among his 
best. Will the world ever see such another Charley 
and James and Leslie?

" MISCORRECTIONS OF MISQUOTATIONS." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Reference is made, in the issue of The Dial for 
November 1, in a paragraph on " Miscorrections of 
Misquotations," to au apparent misquotation from 
Fitz-Gerald's Rubaiyat of Omar. The line which is 
questioned is, 

" Ah, take the cash in hand, and waive the rest," 
on which you comment: " If this last is a variant read- 
ing of the third line of FitzGerald's thirteenth quatrain, 
it is certainly an unfamiliar one." It is a variant 
reading. The first edition, published in 1859, which 
remained long obscure, contained seventy-five quatrains, 
the twelfth of which reads: 

" ' How sweet is mortal Sovranty ! ' — think some : 
Others — ' How blest the Paradise to come ! ' 

Ah, take the Cash in hand and waive the Rest ; 
Oh, the brave Music of a distant Drum ! " 
The fourth and so-called standard edition was issued 
in 1879, and differs widely from the first, as also from 
the second, the latter containing one hundred and ten

quatrains. The third line of the thirteenth quatrain 
here reads : 

" Ah, take the Cash, and let the Promise go." 
The word " Promise " in this line was subsequently- 
changed to " Credit." The third and fourth editions 
differ in a few particulars. The writer cannot refrain 
from expressing the opinion that the first edition still 
excels in forcef ulness and rugged beauty.

IMPROVING THE LANGUAGE. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
Much has been said for and against the neutral 
language Esperanto. It has gained thousands of 
adherents, but its closest students have realized that 
some vital improvement was necessary before it would 
answer the requirements of science and of commerce 
in their international relations. Such an improvement, 
carefully made on the principle of maximum interna^ 
tionality, is now a candidate for public favor. The 
simplified Esperanto, called " Ido," is now in practical 
use, and boasts of two or three magazines in Europe. 
A few words selected at random will serve to show the 
superiority of " Ido " over the old Esperanto.

STORY-TELLING IN SCHOOL AND LIBRARY. 

(To the Editor of The Dls.l.) 

Mr. Dana's argument for story-telling in the schools, 
as quoted in the comment on " The Children's Story- 
Hour at the Public Library," in The Dial of Novem- 
ber 16, seems to me most convincing. We do need 
story-telling in our schoolrooms, and many teachers, 
feeling this need, are systematically studying the sub- 
ject under professional story-tellers. 

But why need the " Story-Hour " in either school- 
room or library be limited to " 40 children " ? We 
have in many school buildings large assembly halls 
seating 500 to 600 children. We also have large 
assembly rooms in many of the Chicago Library sub- 
stations in the " field hoiises " of the small parks. 

Many children clamor for the story-hour. If out of 
a large number forty or fifty children select books and 
follow a suggested course of reading, well and good; 



but a large number besides will have felt the influence 
of the well-told tale, even though they may not at that 
time come in closer contact with the book. 

Occasionally, however, we need the " Story-Hour " in 
the library itself, to draw the children into the library 
building, into the presence of the books and the atmos- 
phere of book-lore. There should be, too, a closer cor- 
relation between the stories told in the library and in 
the school, and the lessons which the child is studying. 
Whenever possible, the librarian should visit the school- 
room and tell an occasional story. On the other hand, 
the teacher should visit the library and cooperate in the 
story-telling work there. There should be no division 
of interest; the object of both teacher and librarian is to 
bring the child and the book nearer together. This can 
be done through the " Story-Hour " held both in the 
library and in the schoolroom.

"THE TUMBLER OF OUR LADY." 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

Our attention has been called to a commimication in 
a recent issue of The Dial, in which it is stated that 
" The Tumbler of Our Lady," in the " New Mediaeval 
Library " published by us, is not now first translated 
from the Middle French as our advertisements claimed. 

We regret to perceive that the wording of our para- 
graph was not more definite. The old manuscript, which 
contains our particular version of " The Tumbler of 
Our Lady " and the remaining Miracles in our volume, 
is now first translated in its entirety. Several versions 
of the translated " Tumbler " we believe exist, though 
we do not know whether Mr. Wicksteed or others trans- 
lated from the same manuscript as did Mrs. Kemp 
Welsh. Certainly they did translate that particular 
story long before she produced her version of the entire 
manuscript. Duffield & Company.

WHISTLER'S PORTRAIT OF HIS MOTHER. 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

In the interesting review of Mr. Phythian's " Fifty 
Years of Modern Painting," in The Dial of November 
16, it is stated that Whistler's portrait of his mother 
hangs in the Louvre, and is considered by the French 
" one of the gems of the collection." 

In 1906 this painting was hanging in the room of the 
Luxembourg Gallery in Paris devoted to foreign paint- 
ers, along with Sargent's " Carmencita " and Melcher's 
" Young Mother." 

The 1904 edition of " Baedeker's Paris," which I have 
at hand, on page 311 speaks of the Whistler painting 
as being in the room referred to in the Luxembourg 
Gallery, and states that it was bought by the gallery 
for 4000 fr. (a ridiculous sum as compared with values 
to-day, if correct). 

It is possible, of course, that the painting has since 
been transferred to the Louvre. l D. T. 

Philadelphia, November 20, 1908.

the picture as still being in the Luxembourg ; and 
this, we suppose, must be regarded as authoritative.

The Personality of Richard Wagner.* 

It would seem that the earthly advent of the 
Great Man, who is to be predominant in his 
sphere and exercise a transforming and elevat- 
ing influence upon his age, should be accom- 
panied by signs and portents, significant and 
assuring to the expectant generation. We 
ought to know him in his infancy, watch with 
protecting care over his growth and develop- 
ment, save him from the disasters implicated in 
his unique temperament, and accept reverently 
his mature work and message, however destruc- 
tive of things long established and subversive of 
our choicest prejudices. 

Such, unhappily, is not the case. Unheralded, 
unproclaimed, he generally appears in some ob- 
scure corner of the earth in circumstances but 
little auspicious to the fulfilment of a great 
destiny. He struggles with needless difficulty 
toward a recognition of the part he is to play on 
the world's stage, and when that consciousness 
arrives he finds himself worse off than before. 
Conservatism and conventionality bring against 
him all their deadening and deadly weapons. 
The hatred of the foolish and the ignorant 
wounds him even while he despises it. An 
atmosphere of chilling misunderstanding sur- 
rounds him. He waits for the hour of real 
appreciation ; and its arrival means a further 
questioning of his serious purposes and a pom- 
pous criticism of his intentions which rarely 
touches the nerve and heart of his life and labors. 

Moreover, his very nature and endowment 
incapacitate him for meeting successfully the 
difficulties of ordinary daily life in which his 
compeers of the average manhood play so com- 
petent a part. He belongs in a region appar- 
ently superimposed upon the visible and tangible 
experiences of earth ; there he is at home, and 
has intuitive understanding of its structure and 
employments ; here he fails in comprehension 
of trifling things, and loses his temper at obsta- 
cles and incongruities. Fortunate is such a 
man if he finds some kindly intermediator who, 
appreciative of the higher realms of art and 
poetry and philosophy, yet has an effective 
grasp of material things and the power to give 
the new revelation a place and meaning in the 
world. 

Such an intermediator Richard Wagner found

in Angelo Neumann ; and no member of the 
genus irritabile ever had one more devoted or 
more capable. Neumann was born in Vienna 
m 1838. He was an accomplished singer, who 
began his career in the Opera at Cracow, and 
in process of time became a leading tenor in his 
native city at the Imperial Theatre. He was 
called in 1876 to Leipsic, by Dr. August 
Forster, Manager of the Leipsic Theatre, and 
was made Director of the Opera there. He 
established a company noteworthy throughout 
Germany, played remarkable engagements in 
Berlin and London, and founded in 1882 the 
Richard Wagner Theatre — a travelling asso- 
ciation of artists who gave performances of the 
music dramas of the master in the leading cities 
of Germany, Belgium, Italy, and Russia ; and 
later he was Director in Bremen and in Prague. 
The Wagner Opera owes Neumann an immense 
debt of recognition and gratitude. 

In Neumann's "Personal Recollections of 
Richard Wagner," now offered to American 
readers in an English translation, the author's 
first study of Wagner's works is presented as 
follows : 

" It was the celebrated singing teacher of those days, 
Therese Stilke-Sassi, of Vienna, who gave me my first 
introduction to the genius of Richard Wagner and fired 
me with an early enthusiasm for his new and wonder- 
ful style. This remarkable woman was training me for 
the stage, and taught me among other things the part 
of Wolfram von Eschenbach in Tannhauser. 

" I mention this particularly as in those days — the 
early forties * — it was rare indeed to find a singer with 
this role in his repertory, and managers then found it 
most diffeult to cast the important part. Being young 
and impressionable — a boy of nineteen — I soon became 
an ardent disciple of the Master." 

This enthusiasm grew with the passage of the 
years. In 1862, when Neumann became a 
member of the Royal Opera Company in Vienna, 
Wagner began his own career in that city. He 
was endeavoring to produce his " Tristan," 
which after forty-seven rehearsals was pro- 
nounced wholly impossible. He was giving 
great concerts in which he tried to interest the 
public in his new and extraordinary music. 
Later, Neumann was in the Royal Opera Com- 
pany when Wagner conducted his rehearsals for 
" Lohengrin '' and " Tannhauser." Of these 
rehearsals, our author says : 

" I was especially interested, as I then contemplated 
taking the superintendence of a theatre myself. What 
an inspiring director he was ! How he understood the 
art of spurring on his men, of getting his best work out 
of each one of them, of making each gesture, each ex- 
pression, tell ! These rehearsals convinced me that

Richard Wagner was not only the greatest dramatist 
of all time, but also the greatest of managers and a 
marvellous character actor as well. Now at the end of 
these long thirty years I can still distinctly recall 
certain incidents of his wonderful mimetic powers." 

On August 13, 1876, the first performance 
of the " Nibelungen Ring " occurred at Bay- 
reuth. Neumann was then Director of the 
Leipsic Theatre. Dr. Forster, the manager of 
this theatre, returned from the first presenta- 
tion of the Cycle with the strong conviction 
that the work was not deserving of repetition. 
He dissuaded Neumann from going to Bayreuth 
to attend a second performance of the Cycle. 
A friend from Vienna — Julius Nilius — had 
returned with Forster from Bayreuth, and after 
the theatre the three went to a restaurant for 
supper. 

" There the conversation naturally turned on the 
'Ring.' When I admitted that I 'd given up going on 
the, strength of Forster's account, Nilius exclaimed, ' I 
want to tell you something, my dear fellow. Of course 
I can't judge whether or not the staging is possible, but 
of one thing I'm quite sure; and that is, that in your 
capacity as director of the opera in Leipsic, it 's nothing 
short of your duty to see this performance, no matter 
what it conflicts with.' As he said this, he drew from 
his pocket a ticket for the second cycle and handed it 
to me." 

The visit bore its expected fruit, for two years 
thereafter, in spite of tedious waits and delays, 
disheartening obstacles, and serious discourage- 
ments, Neumann produced the " Nibelungen 
Ring " at Leipsic with great success. On this 
occasion Liszt came over from Weimar, and 
telegraphed to Wagner, "Neumann has man- 
aged the affair in some respects even better than 
you did at Bayreuth." 

After Leipsic, Neumann proceded to the 
other and larger successes. He was emboldened 
to undertake greater tasks and win more import- 
ant victories. Berlin allured him. The obstacles 
were manifold ; officialdom had to be met and 
appeased; but the "Ring" was triumphantly 
put on the stage, and met the reception it 
deserved. Then came futile attempts to present 
the Wagner Opera in Paris ; then the London 
triumph ; finally the organization of the Wagner 
Theater. This was a travelling company of the 
great singers of Germany, who visited the 
leading cities of the Fatherland, and played the 
Music Dramas before thronged and enthusias- 
tic audiences. All the noble artists were at one 
time or another under Neumann's direction. 
Nieman, Scaria, linger, Vogel, Lieban, Amalia, 
Matema, Hedwig, Reicher-Kinderman, Therese 
Vogel, Rosa Sucher, Marie Wilt, sang for him ; 
Sucher, Seidl, Mottl, Nikisch, conducted for him. 



He went about spreading the great new gospel, 
doing for the master what a disciple so devoted 
and so ardent alone could do — making the 
world know how priceless a possession had again 
been placed in its keeping. 

The portrait given in these Recollections of 
the Master, as Wagner was now generally called, 
is a full-length and appreciative representation. 
Wagner had now reached the recognition that 
placed him among the foremost men of his age. 
He was regarded as one of the great dramatists, 
and the first of musicians since Beethoven. 
Mr. Neumann shows everywhere the deepest 
admiration and reverence for him ; monarchs, 
statesmen, composers, litterateurs, vied with 
each other in honoring and lauding him. 

Wagner was the most insistent of men in 
various ways, but he showed the warmest esteem 
for those who labored in his behalf. Neumann 
relates the following occurrence at the presenta- 
tion of " Siegfried " in Berlin : 

" The Master had recommended his Bayreuth singer, 
Schlosser, for the part of Mime, but I had decided to 
give the role to Julius Lieban, an ideal Mime and a 
member of our Leipsic cast. At the close of the first 
act, Wagner, who had never seen the young singer be- 
fore, could hardly contain himself. With his charac- 
teristic dash he flew on the stage, and stormed up the 
steps, passing Lieban, whom he did not recognize, in his 
hurry. The singer himself, young and inexperienced, 
was hurrying down the stairs, anxious to hear the Mas- 
ter's verdict. As he passed him by, I called to Wagner, 
' Master, that is our Lieban,' but not recognizing the 
name, he hurried on, still looking for the artist; till I 
finally cried, 'Master, that is our Mime!' Then he 
stopped suddenly, wheeled, and rushed at Lieban, who 
stood there, trembling at the thought of meeting 
Wagner. The Master threw his arms about him in an 
ecstasy of enthusiasm, and when he exclaimed, ' You 
did that wonderfully — it was simply matchless ! ' the 
young fellow fairly cried for joy, and kissed his hand in 
reverence and gratitude." 

The relations between Neumann and Wag- 
ner, though sometimes strained, recovered from 
every misunderstanding and closed with the 
profound friendship that was the result of a 
long and serious association. Neumann per- 
sistently besought the Master to give him per- 
mission to produce " Parsifal " outside of Bay- 
reuth. In an important letter Wagner writes : 

" ' Parsifal ' — once and for all — belongs exclusively 
to my Bayreuth theatre, and it is at our yearly festivals 
that this work is to be presented. The segregation is 
due to the lofty character of the work itself. My crea- 
tion of ' Parsifal ' shall stand or fall with Bayreuth. At 
least this shall be the case until my death ; for who then 
will carry out my intentions is still a problem to me. In 
case my powers, which are put to such unspeakable 
tests by these performances, should be exhausted be- 
fore my life, and I should no longer be able to attend 
to the details, I should have to think of some other

plan for carrying out the traditions of my work. If by 
that time your Wagner Opera Company has reached 
that perfect plane towards which you are constantly 
advancing with my other works, I might then find it 
feasible to turn over to you my ' Parsifal ' for certain 
festival performances at stated occasions; audit is only 
to you, and on these terms, that I shall ever consign my 
« Parsifal.' " 

Mr. Neumann's book is written in an agreea- 
ble and intimate style ; it has more interest than 
the novels of the day ; it tells a moving and 
heroic story ; it abounds in characteristic anec- 
dotes and incidents ; it places the master and his 
immediate entourage before us in clear light ; 
it brings us into close intimacy with the great 
people and great artists of the place and period. 
The translator, Miss Edith Livermore, has done 
her work well. The publishers have made a 
fine and presentable book. It contains a num- 
ber of portraits and a facsimile letter of Wag- 
ner's, received by Neumann after the master's 
death in Venice. There is a copious and satis- 
factory index. Louis James Block. 



The DEVOIiOPMENT OF MODEKN ART.* 

Julius Meier-Graefe's elaborate study of 
" The Development of Modern Art " is laid 
before English-speaking readers in two stout 
quarto volumes, finely printed, and embellished 
with a large number of full-page illustrations, 
mostly half-tones of excellent quality. These 
plates call for more than casual mention, not 
only because they contribute much to the attrac- 
tiveness of the volumes, but because they form 
au unusually representative collection covering 
the entire period dealt with in the book. In 
selecting the paintings, drawings, and sculptures 
for reproduction, pains have been taken to choose 
works displaying the salient characteristics of 
the artists' styles. Therefore they reaUy illus- 
trate. Without their aid the book would not 
be as readable as it is, nor would the opinions 
expressed be as intelligible. 

The author calls the book " a contribution to 
a new system of aesthetics." Nowhere, how- 
ever, in all the six hundred and fifty closely 
packed pages is there any attempt to formulate 
such a system. The nearest approach to it is 
in the following passage : 

" The one point which I trust this book will make 
clear is the necessity for clearer views upon an organic 
system of {esthetics, an organic culture from which we 

• Modern Akt : Being a contribution to a New System of 
Esthetics. By Julius Meier-Graefe. Translated from the 
German by Florence Simmonds and George W. Chrystal. In

are worlds removed, and of which we have not the 
slightest inkling. I hope to show that certain things 
belong not to culture, but to life, that these things are 
necessary to the expression of intellectual needs, and 
are to be accepted even more unquestioningly than the 
convention that we shall not eat with our knives or 
introduce ladies to gentlemen. Culture is the due com- 
pletion of our consciousness with everything necessary 
to the comprehension and furtherance of the claims of 
the present. Of a hundred important artists born within 
so many years, a certain number are indispensable, not 
because they produce this or that effect upon the mind, 
but because they affect their age and because they are 
symbolical of ourselves, and to know them is to have a 
true knowledge of our own life, to possess a means of 
resistance to that pessimism which can see nothing good 
in our own time, and a valuable weapon against the wild 
optimism which declines to see what is bad in it." 

This extract is quoted at length because it 
well sets forth the author's major premise and 
at the same time affords a glimpse of his forcible 
and often piquant style. As reflected in what 
is apparently an excellent translation, this style 
is sometimes lucid and at other times a mixture 
of clever epigram and verbosity in which the 
leading thought is not readily disentangled from 
a wealth of illustrative imagery that obscures it. 
One may not always agree with what is said ; 
indeed, most readers are likely to find themselves 
alternately assenting to and differing from the 
views expressed. But always there is entertain- 
ment and mental stimulus. This is especially 
true of the brilliant opening chapter. In one 
significant paragraph, " the great error that 
retards our artistic culture " is so pertinently 
stated that it is impossible to refrain from a 
further quotation. 

" In these days, the pure work of art has been brought 
into immediate contact with every-day life ; an attempt 
has been made to transform it utterly, to make it the 
medium of the aesthetic aspirations of the house, whereas 
this function belongs properly to the house itself and 
the utilitarian objects in it. We have tried to popu- 
larize the highest expression of art, something only 
significant when applied to the loftiest purposes, some- 
thing, the enjoyment of which without a certain solem- 
nity is inconceivable, or, at least, only to be attained in 
moments of peculiar detachment. We have succeeded 
merely in vulgarizing it." 

In the dominance of planes over lines, Mr, 
Meier-Graefe sees the quality that most mark- 
edly differentiates modern art from that which 
preceded it. He therefore begins his survey 
with Rubens and Rembrandt, who, he says, 
with the Venetians and Velasquez, were the 
heroes of the victorious struggle in which the 
new manner supplanted the old. The idea that 
in the contemplation of modern paintings the 
soul receives a sense of enlargement and enrich- 
ment beyond the power of line to communicate, 
runs through the author's lengthy examination

of the position and achievements of the notable 
European artists of the eighteenth and nine- 
teenth centuries. With this there is constantly 
associated the idea of continuous growth and 
development from one artist to another. 

That the progress of art has been along what 
may be called evolutionary channels cannot be 
gainsaid. Nevertheless, the aesthetic base upon 
whi(jh all art rests remains unchanged. The 
weak point in Mr. Meier-Graefe's philosophy is 
the undue exaltation of a single aspect of truth. 
To this he might, and doubtless would, retort 
that upon the question of what is and is not 
aesthetic, opinions differ. Even so ; but in the 
last analysis it is neither line nor plane that 
counts, it is something beyond and above either 
— the creative power that brings all the ele- 
ments in a composition into harmonic relation. 
This, if Mr. Meier-Graefe perceives, he does not 
assert. Of his verdicts upon individual artists 
it may be said in brief, since it is impossible 
here to traverse the long chronicle with him, 
that they are always interesting. We are not, 
however, yet far enough removed from the 
nineteenth century to pass final judgment.

Music and Comedy in Eighteenth 
Century Italy.* 



If there were a neater rendering of the facile 
Italian phrase, istruir dilettando, than "to 
instruct while charming," I should like to bor- 
row it for use in connection with an incredible 
sort of book. Twenty-seven years ago there 
appeared in England a large volume bearing 
the title " Studies of the Eighteenth Century 
in Italy," by Vernon Lee. Even conservative 
critics found therein freshness and novelty, with 
much interesting and diverting information ; 
while from some it evoked such tributes as " the 
unsurpassed verve of this brilliant writer," and 
in Italy it became a sort of text-book. It 
turned out to be the work of a brilliant young 
Englishwoman, Miss Violet Paget, whose pen- 
name of Vernon Lee has since become well 
known to the English-reading world. She was 
but twenty years of age when this remarkable 
book was written — an unquestioned fact not 
quite easy to believe even yet. Now that the 
work appears in a new and handsome edition 
bearing the imprint of an American publisher,

Vernon Lee. New edition, enlarged, with new Preface and

considerations of its vivid portrayal of Italian 
life of the period, with the scarcity of good 
books in English relating to it, may justify the 
attempt to weigh once more what this youthful 
critic and historian had to offer. The reviewer's 
general conclusion is pretty clearly indicated by 
the opening sentence above ; and his chief fear 
is that any sober attempt to map out the im- 
portant currents of the volume may obscure the 
fact that it is above all else interesting, readable, 
charming. 

Literary and musical studies in eighteenth- 
century Italy do not exact any particular knowl- 
edge of the political history of the peninsula. 
To my juvenile complaint that the history of 
Italy during that period was unattractive, a 
wise friend replied : " Remember the treaty of 
Rastadt in March, 1714, which left to Charles 
VI. of Austria, as his share of the Spanish 
inheritance, Milan, Mantua, Naples, and Sar- 
dinia ; the transfers of Naples and Sicily to 
Don Carlos in the early thirties ; the compara- 
tive quiet of the papal domain, the Venetian 
territory, and most of the minor states. Then 
forget the years until the coming of the French 
in 1796." This invasion was the beginning of 
the storm, from which in the far future the new 
Italy was to emerge, — the nineteenth-century 
Italy, with its divine aspirations, its bitter pro- 
tracted struggles and glorious self-realization. 
The eighteenth century was essentially a time 
of recovery from the blighting influences of 
the wretched Spanish regime. To the actual 
making of history, Italy contributed practically 
nothing. In the writing of history, however, 
she numbered many honorable names, as she 
did also in philosophy and jurisprudence. In 
general literature there was considerable activ- 
ity ; and one recalls a few names of real dis- 
tinction. In tragedy we all remember Alfieri, 
even if we forget Maffei Martelli and Antonio 
Conti. But in music, lyric drama, and comedy, 
she was making magnificent contributions, which 
must be understood if we are to grasp the sub- 
sequent history of these activities in Europe. 
This was perceived in some unexplained way by 
the youthful mind of Vernon Lee, and the vol- 
ume before us deals primarily with music and 
comedy, and all the background of persons and 
places that they imply. 

The musical life of our period is not easily 
summarized ; indeed, it defies hurried treatment 
of any sort. You must linger at services in 
metropolitan cathedrals, where saints and angels 
are made to sing like heroes and heroines of 
opera, or in humbler provincial churches, where 



402

you will realize that many years have passed 
since Palestrina's day. You must loiter down 
village streets of an evening, in the golden 
Italian summer time, the mind vagrant as the 
wandering musicians themselves, the heart free 
from care, and take your place among the people 
listening to the hurletta^ lightly rendered by 
strolling players. In the very streets there is 
music of serenaders, or larking shop-boys or 
what not ; and on the morrow you may hear 
boatman or peasant singing at his work. If you 
are fortunate you may be bidden to a dilettante 
concert at some cultured hospitable home. You 
must visit at least one of the famous charity 
music schools for boys at Naples, or for girls at 
Venice, where you will hear performances un- 
surpassed by the contemporary Parisian stage. 
Finally, when the late autumn has come, you 
must betake yourself to the opera house in one 
of the great musical centres and hear the ambi- 
tious lyric drama, the opera seria. The music 
will interest you much ; the players and singers, 
more ; the audience, perhaps, most. At first you 
will be indignant at these beaux and fine ladies 
playing cards in the boxes or chatting capri- 
ciously ; at these men in the pit comparing son- 
nets or epigrams. And why do the authorities 
allow such a nondescript disorderly mob in the 
gallery? But a fine number comes and then you 
understand. The individuals of this audience, 
patrician and plebeian alike, love music and know 
music. When they are not paying attention, it 
is because attention is not deserved ; when they 
applaud, it is not because of the fame of com- 
poser or singer, but because there is something 
that charms their ears. Then you will agree 
with our author that art demands, not volitional 
attention, but instinctive appreciation. And per- 
haps, after all these varied experiences, you will 
realize that these eighteenth century Italians 
lived music, as it were, and that the serious 
opera is only a deeper breath of a general life. 
The word opera carries us back to the seven- 
teenth century, which saw the welding of melody, 
recitativo, mimetic, and mechanical show into 
the musical drama that these melomaniac 
southerners called the work. This was the 
heritage that Apostolo Zeno and his successor, 
Pietro Metastasio (1698-1782) elaborated and 
brought to perfection. Roughly speaking, they 
used the much-berated recitativo for the action 
of the play, and melody for what may be called 
the stationary parts : " the lyrical similes, the 
solitary outpourings," and similar features. The 
appearance of Metastasio's " Didone Abandon- 
nata " in 1723 " offered a musical perfection, an 



elegance of variety of blank verse and rhyme, 
such as had not hitherto been known." Between 
1733 and 1740 he produced his masterpieces. 
Herein the recitativo, as primarily the poet's 
work, was helped by the subordination of the 
musician, while the air was recognized as the 
latter's realm, wherein the poet most glorified 
himself by giving all possible scope to the com- 
poser and vocalist. Throughout the greater 
plays, the emotional situation was developed 
with a finished skill that moved rapidly to its 
goal, while showing with adequate clearness each 
significant step. It is perhaps unwise to say that 
this type of lyric drama was not capable of 
greater achievement ; but at any rate subsequent 
generations quickly left the melodramma for 
the opera with which we are now familiar. It 
is easy to see how the development of rhythm, 
accompaniment, and concertation, of harmonic 
and orchestral elaboration, led to the nineteenth 
century opera, — "a symphony of voices and 
instruments accompanying, more or less closely, 
a dramatic action." But along this path, with 
Gluck and Mozart, we may not wander. 

By these German names we are reminded of 
the controversy as to the relative value of the 
contributions of Italy and Germany during the 
period under treatment, a question to which 
Miss Paget returns with great vigor in her new 
preface. She points out the priority of the 
Italians in melody, more particularly; and 
dwells on the tremendous importance of all their 
" pioneering " work. The preponderant in- 
fluence of Scarlatti on the sequent generations 
of musicians in both countries, can hardly be 
questioned ; and our author indicates the rela- 
tions in a striking figure. Roughly speaking the 
Italian and German composers throughout the 
eighteenth century formed a brotherhood ; " but 
a brotherhood as of Jacob and Esau. Italian 
Esau, a mighty hunter (in Sir Hubert Parry's 
text ' pioneer '), but impulsive and lazy, selling 
his birthright for the pottage of vocal virtuoso- 
ship and general slipshod facility ; German 
Jacob getting the blessing meant for his elder, 
and putting it to profit under the personal guid- 
ance of the god of Thoroughness," and so forth. 
But we may surely appreciate the work of the 
Italian Esau without belittling the services of 
the German Jacob. Comparison is without 
profit only when it seeks to lower one nation or 
person in order that another may be exalted; 
and the student who has no aim save historical 
accuracy will gladly recognize that the eigh- 
teenth century maestro and the contemporary 
Kapellmeister were alike serving Apollo and

the Muses for the ultimate weal of the art they 
cherished. 

In passing from the old Opera Seria to 
Comedy, we make a rather abrupt but natural 
transition ; for they flourished side by side and 
in almost equal vigor. To some of us, perhaps, 
the latter is more of a reality ; and not a few 
readers for whom Metastasio is rather vague 
have a fairly distinct conception of Goldoni, the 
Menander of his century. And Quintilian's 
tribute to the Greek, omnem vitce imaginem 
expressit, would be quite as applicable to the 
Italian. That , Goldoni's comedy grew out of 
the Comedy of Masks is a commonplace ; but 
the history of the latter type is not clear in all 
its details. In some form or other it is as old 
as Italian civilization, or even a previous stage 
in Aryan development. A crude farce of buf- 
foons and improvisations is an early device of 
the mimetic creature called man. And down 
the centuries from Oscan days to the present 
year, some form of this primitive play has existed 
in Italy. Passing over the earlier stages, we 
recall that during the unhappy days of the six- 
teenth century the Comedy of Masks saw a 
marked revival : " Laughter in misery, buffoon- 
eries to drown the recollection of ignominy ; 
merriment to hide seditious sorrow, local satire 
to hide national satire, dialect to save Italian ; 
at any rate, one means of satisfying that inde- 
structible craving for fun in the Italian nature. 
Pan talon e, Brighilla, Arlecchino, and II Dottore 
were the four standard masks of the northern 
group. The terrible Pulcinella, the tempestuous 
Scaramuccia, the simpleton Tartaglia, the vaga- 
bondish Coviello, formed the equally represen- 
tative southern types. With them were count- 
less other buffoons, less generic and less abiding. 
These were the central figures in the Commedia 
delV Arte, although other actors were necessary, 
even for the slight plots about which the all- 
important drolleries played in erratic scintilla- 
tion. In the sixteenth century, companies of 
comedians were found everywhere in Italy ; and 
in fact in many other parts of Western Europe. 
In 1577, for instance, we remember that a band 
of mask actors migrated to England, and exer- 
cised some considerable influence on English 
drama. In one sense, the old contention that 
1600 marked the zenith of this comedy is right ; 
for by this time it had reached its " most artis- 
tic shape and its highest polish." But there is 
as much truth in Vernon Lee's contention that 
the seventeenth century was its golden age ; for 
it had a more vigorous, if less literary, life among 
the people. It was more itself, so to say, than 



in its finer clothes. At any rate this was the 
thing that came to Goldoni's door and under his 
hands grew into the Realistic Comedy. 

At first not only did the general framework 
remain unchanged, but the written text merely 
represented the old extemporized interplay of 
dialogue. The actors were the old " type " 
actors, who had played Harlequin, Pulcinella, 
and the rest. All was movement, retort, fun; 
"the scene changed as recklessly as the words." 
And in Goldoni's best period all of these origi- 
nal elements are perceptible ; but his actors be- 
come diversified and ordered ; his characters 
become coextensive with the life of his times ; 
his plots become less filmy and more natural, 
until he elaborates the high type of comedy seen 
in "II Vero Amico " and "La Locandiera." 

Of the waves of hostility that dashed against 
our comedian ; of his later years and laughter- 
moving memoirs ; of Carlo Gozzi and the 
" Venetian Fairy Comedy," written in reaction 
against the Realistic Comedy, we may not treat. 
But we may point out that Vernon Lee has not 
given quite an adequate account of the various 
influences under which Goldoni's power was 
developed. In our modest opinion she is too 
cavalier in her attitude towards Moliere; and 
she has practically neglected the Venetian's 
indebtedness to Plautus and Terence, not to men- 
tion Aristophanes. Goldoni added a scholar's 
training to his natural vis comica, and it is much 
easier to understand his career if we keep that 
fact in mind. 

Compared with the chapters that suggested 
the foregoing thoughts, those on " The Arcadian 
Academy" are less important. But they are 
delightful, and properly come first in the book ; 
for in our wanderings we do continually en- 
counter these Arcadians. On a spring morning 
of 1692, fourteen men interested in letters were 
meeting in the Prati di Castello at Rome. " It 
seems to-day as if Arcadia were reviving for us," 
said one of them, and the omen was grasped. 
Fourteen pastoral names were assigned to those 
present, and the Arcadian Academy was consti- 
tuted. It was ambitious : it was to be the literary 
arbiter of Italy and make a golden age of poetry. 
It became the vogue. Colonies were founded in 
in every part of the peninsula from Venice to 
Naples ; princes and senators mingled in this 
literary commonwealth. And all went well, 
despite internal disturbances, until it occurred 
to somebody that the thing was ridiculous, that 
Arcadia was a joke. Then it began to wane. 
In 1775 its glory was restored for a moment ; 
but' it was only a flutter. And in the destruc- 



404

[Dec. 1, 



tive years of transition from the eighteeenth to 
the nineteenth century, Arcadia disappeared 
almost as the fabric of a dream. The first time 
I was in Rome one could find on the Janiculum 
a tiny villa, the old Bosco Parrhasio, quaint in 
its very desolation. Already it was practically 
forgotten, and the pictures of the immortal shep- 
herds and shepherdesses had been removed to 
the Academy ; by this time it has probably dis- 
appeared. And yet it once really represented 
literature in Italy. 

The most hostile and fruitful criticisms of the 
volume have probably been written by Miss 
Paget herself, in the preface to the new edition. 
She says it must be full of presumptuousness 
and f oUy ; that the eighteenth century was hum- 
drum ; that the enthusiasm of youth is fuU of 
piety, but also of ruthlessness ; that her ignor- 
ance of music was pathetic ; that she never dis- 
tinguished between the novelist's plausibility and 
historic probability. And there is much truth 
in these strictures. Howbeit, she loves her book 
too well to change it ; it is her dream, and for 
better or for worse shall be kept unmarred. 
Herein I think her instinct is right. Or, if she 
errs, it is with Stevenson and all other good 
lovers of life who will leave to each age its own 
heart. In addition to the imperfections empha- 
sized by the author herself, any reader will note 
defects in style, some of them unpardonable ; but 
the book could not be re-written after thirty 
years without losing something from the beauty 
of its wings, if not some of its real power of flight. 

As one puts the volume aside, there arises 
the inevitable question : What sort of young 
person was this, who at the age of twenty wrote 
a book that is really valuable as well as a joy to 
the reader? Some explanation is to be found 
in her subjects and sources ; for the matei'iarum 
ingenium is a very real thing. But this still 
leaves a decidedly large residuum to be explained 
by the personality of the author. In " The 
Eighteenth Century," and in some of her essays, 
we catch provoking glimpses of her earlier life 
and training, glimpses which make us hope that 
some day we shall be favored with a definitely 
autobiographical sketch of those youthful years, 
written in the fine vein discernible throughout 
her better writings. 

The book is weU printed, attractively ar- 
ranged, and handsomely bound. The illus- 
trations, selected by Dr. Guido Biagi of the 
Laurentian Library, Florence, are excellent, 
and contribute their share to the vividness that 
is perhaps the salient characteristic of the work.

Latter-day Novelists of France.* 



It needs no literary Sherlock Holmes to dis- 
cover a feminine hand in the volume entitled 
" French Novelists of To-day." Phraseology 
and details of perspective aside, a critic of the 
masculine gender would scarcely have classed 
Madame Favre de Coulevain, — the bewilder- 
ingly eclectic admirer of George Meredith and 
Marie Corelli, the anxious student of five- 
o'clock teas and of the exact boundaries of the 
bourgeoisie — with Anatole France and Paul 
Bourget, in a volume which presumably dis- 
cusses the most considerable of the current 
French novelists. It is only justice to admit 
that the author's avowed object is somewhat 
different — namely, " to indicate what contem- 
porary French novels are likely to interest 
English readers." But is it impertinence to 
remind the fair critic that novels more likely 
still to interest English readers are "Arsene 
Lupin " and " La Chambre Jaune," or certain 
volumes of dubious decency, and to suggest that 
she has attempted to pick those authors whose 
works ought to interest English readers rather 
than those that are likely to interest them? 
With the possible exception of the lady men- 
tioned, the choice has been a good one for this 
purpose. 

If Winifred Stephens is able to attract the 
general reading public's attention to the eight 
notable novelists whose names fill her table of 
contents, she will succeed in doing what has 
thus far been done only very imperfectly, at 
least in America. Pierre Loti is read here a 
little, and Paul Bourget a little. One story 
by Anatole France, " The Crime of Sylvestre 
Bonnard," is known and loved ; Marcel Prevost 
is attracting more attention in this country by 
his sociological theories than by his fiction ; 
Rene Bazin is beginning to be known a little 
on this side of the water ; Maurice Barres and 
Edouard Rod are no more than names to the 
average American reader. 

The volume carries as a motto the hopeful 
prophecy of Paul Sabatier : " Mysteriously and 
sadly, making many experiments and many mis- 
takes as she goes, France is journeying toward 
a new ideal." It is difficult, however, to find a 
common ideal in the activities of the extremely 
varied eight before us; and if the author has 
found it, she has made no clear statement of her 
discovery. Anatole France is so subtle and 
ironical that no one can confidently brand him

as either pious or irreligious. He confesses him- 
self a socialist, and rails at wealth and poverty. 
He is so far from a narrow nationalism that he 
stood next to Zola in the band of defenders of 
Dreyfus. Marcel Prevost is a dogmatist ; he 
never writes a line without a moral object. In 
literary theory he is as extreme a romanticist as 
Anatole France is decided in his preference for 
classical traditions. It follows very naturally 
that his fluent and vigorous style is full of faults 
that his great contemporary would never have 
been guilty of. " The writers of the past," says 
Jules Lemaitre in discussing the writers of the 
present, " sometimes wrote weakly ; they never 
wrote badly." Prevost is so far from the cheer- 
ful skepticism of the older writer that the fearful 
intensity of his interest in the preparation of 
" Les Vierges Fortes " resulted in a nervous 
breakdown. He is an ardent feminist, and is 
ready with theories and plans for the cure of 
every social evil. Paul Bourget, on the other 
hand, is, as the author neatly puts it, " the 
apostle of arrested development," An ardent 
Catholic for some years back, he places the 
world's salvation in blind submission to tradi- 
tionary authority. Bourgeois by birth and 
early associations, he shows a preference for the 
aristocracy that lays him open to the charge of 
snobbery. Maurice Barrds began his literary 
life as an individualist, but seems to be travel- 
ling toward collectivism ; literary artist and lover 
of words for their own sake like Anatole France, 
ardent Catholic like Bourget, he professes a 
socialistic theory as earnest as the former's and 
a traditionalism almost as dogmatic as the lat- 
ter's. Barres is a furious militarist, and a 
relentless Jew-baiter ; women are to him, for the 
most part, merely instruments for the bearing 
of children. 

Rene Bazin, unlike all the others, is a whole- 
some, sweet-spirited optimist. He is careless of 
the existence of a feminist question. To him, 
a man is a human being and a woman another ; 
and the favorite French theme of unlawful love 
plays little part in his cheerful stories of the 
soil. There is evil in the world, and he dis- 
cusses it frankly ; but he sees it more than com- 
pensated for by the host of kind and thought- 
ful ones who are always at hand to soothe and 
comfort ; and he has no algebraic formulae to con- 
jure it with. He is not a mocker — even a gen- 
ial one like France ; he is very serious and very 
earnest in condemnation of the wrong ; but, in 
Bruneti^re's happy phrase, " he never raises his 
voice "; he possesses the rare faculty of literary 
self-control. 



Edouard Rod, the nondescript Swiss pessi- 
mist, is fond of denominating himself un cher- 
cheur desinteresse, which our critic somewhat 
unexpectedly translates as " a detached inves- 
tigator." He refuses to ally himself with any 
school of thought. A Calvinist by birth, he 
has grown so enthusiastic in his admiration of 
the Catholic Church that the world has been 
waiting for him to follow the reactionaries 
into her bosom ; but the prospect of his doing 
so grows less and less. He has shifted in views 
and method more frequently and decidedly per- 
haps than any other writer on our list. At first 
a crass naturalist of the school of Zola, he has 
developed into an exponent of the manner of 
writing which he names by the self-explanatory 
term " Intuitionism." His forte is the portrayal 
of the sort of violent passion which makes no 
appeal to Bazin. Religiously an agnostic, he 
has no patience with bigoted anti-religionists; 
profoundly moved by social problems of the 
day, he is as sure as is Bourget that the old 
ways are better. 

Last of all comes Pierre Loti, unlettered 
and spontaneous as Anatole France is learned 
and artful ; purposeless as Prevost is earnest, 
pagan as Bourget is Catholic ; selfish as Edouard 
Rod is devoted ; a lover of art for art's sake ; 
the greatest of living impressionists. Where is 
the common ideal toward which this group is 
tending? They have not even the common 
trait of doctrinarianism which the critic who is 
somewhat barren of ideas may ordinarily attri- 
bute with safety to a Frenchman. 

There is nothing for it but to consider this 
book a collection of eight distinct biographical 
studies ; and very charming and suggestive little 
studies they are. Loti and Bazin the poets, 
Anatole France the curious scholar, Barres and 
Bourget and Prevost the philosophers, are 
quoted, annotated, and catalogued, in a manner 
that is sane and thoroughly delightful. The 
picture of the young Loti, so filled with a long- 
ing for travel that " pictures of palm-trees and 
the very word ' colony ' were enough to make 
him wildly excited " is a vivid one ; and it is 
not easy to get away from the account of his 
first sight of the sea, which was to fill so much 
of his life with love, and fear, and sadness. 

" He had gone with his parents to a village on the 
coast of Saintonge. On his first arrival he had not 
been able to catch a glimpse of the ocean, hidden behind 
sand-hills. But as soon as dinner was over, he could 
contain his curiosity no longer. He escaped alone, and 
in the darkening twilight made his way down a wind- 
ing path through the sand-hiUs to the shore. There 
was a keenness and a bitterness in the air he had 



406

never before experienced. He heard in the distance 
a dull sound, at once loud and indistinct. Suddenly 
there opened out before his gaze the ocean wrapped 
in the glow of the evening sky. Paralyzed with 
fear, he stood still, while this dark roaring mass seemed 
to come up from all directions. Of a dark green 
color, almost black it appeared, unstable, perfidious, 
engulfing." 

The youth of Anatole France is described as 
sympathetically, although very differently ; in- 
deed, it was a very different sort of youth. As 
he himself says, in our present author's trans- 
lation : 

" At seven years old, I did not know how to read ; 
I wore divided skirts; I cried when my nurse wiped 
my nose, and I was devoured by ambition. If I had 
been able I would have gone forth to win immortality 
on the battle-field; but a horse, a imiform, a regi- 
ment, enemies, were not for me. Therefore I thought 
of becoming a saint. The profession of saint has fewer 
requirements and wins greater renown than that of a 
soldier." 

So he set about becoming a saint. But his 
attempts at fasting brought his mother down 
upon him with tonics and nostrums ; the servant 
refused to allow him to imitate Stylites on the 
kitchen pump ; his father pronounced him crazy 
when he emulated St. Nicholas of Patras by 
throwing his playthings and twelve new sous 
out of the study window, and unfeelingly 
thrashed him when he tried to manufacture a 
hair-shirt out of the cushions of the stuffed 
chairs. So he became sympathetic with the 
hermits who renounced all intercourse with their 
fellows and took up their abode in desert 
places ; and he thought seriously of retiring to 
a secluded corner among the wild animals of 
the Jardin des Plantes. 

The doctrinaires are not so amusing. I ques- 
tion if their work is as significant, even. It is 
possible that the gentle playfulness of "The 
Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard " and the infinite 
sadness of " The Iceland Fisherman " will be 
remembered when all the romans a these are 
forgotten ; and that it is not Bourget the tradi- 
tionalist or Prevost the reformer whom succeed- 
ing generations will admire, but Bourget the 
consummate story-builder and Prevost the sym- 
pathetic student of female character. 

" French Novelists of To-Day " is written for 
the " general reader." It presupposes very 
little knowledge of the subject, and each chapter 
is headed with a complete list of the works of 
the novelist, with dates. The author also gives 
the date of each writer's birth, with the excep- 
tion of Pierre de Coulevain, who is a lady and 
hence exempt from chronological scrutiny.

Those to whom " a tiny rivulet of text meandering 
between broad meadows of margin " signifies the 
acme of luxurious book-making will take much com- 
fort in the sumptuous setting given to Mr. Otto H. 
Bacher's " With Whistler in Venice " (Century Co.). 
If, because of the large type and broad expanse of 
blank paper, these reminiscences seem to have less 
substance than when printed in the pages of the 
" Century Magazine," they have lost none of their 
entertaining quality, and exemplify once more the 
pertinency of the saying that personal recollections 
furnish a most agreeable form of literary dissipation. 
Especial interest attaches to these because they deal 
with a period in Whistler's life about which com- 
paratively little is known. Bankrupt as a conse- 
quence of the famous lawsuit with Ruskin, he went 
to Venice toward the end of the year 1879, having 
accepted a commission to make a series of etchings 
for the Fine Arts Society of London. There Mr. 
Bacher first met him, and the friendship was formed 
that continued unbroken as long as Whistler lived. 
Many anecdotes are related of the days that Whistler 
spent in Venice. These picture " Jimmy "as an 
indefatigable worker, as the helpful and inspiring 
associate of a group of young artists of whom the 
narrator was one, and, in spite of his eccentricities 
and his dominant personality, as an ever-charming 
comrade and faithful friend. Incidentally they 
furnish considerable information about the methods 
employed by the master, which were often so pecu- 
liarly his own as to be inimitable. Bearing on this, 
an amusing tale is told of the Russian artist Wolkoff 
(otherwise Roussoff, as he is known in London), 
who ridiculed Whistler's pastels, declaring he could 
execute others that could not be distinguished from 
them. A wager followed ; then a long delay which 
Wolkoff explained was caused by his inability to buy 
in Venice the brilliant pastels with which Whistler 
obtained his effects. He was then accorded an 
opportunity to select some pieces from Whistler's 
own box ; but they proved no better, the brilliancy 
lying not in the materials, but in Whistler's use 
of them. The volume is embellished by reproduc- 
tions of a number of the Venice series of etchings, 
and of several etchings by Mr. Bacher of views from 
the windows of the Casa Jankovitz, where Whistler 
roomed. Facsimiles are given of four letters writ- 
ten by him to Mr. Bacher. In one of these mention 
is made of Theodore Duret, the Parisian connoisseur, 
whose portrait is one of Whistler's masterpieces. 
Strange as it may seem, neither Mr. Bacher nor his 
publishers have been able to read the name, though 
it is plainly written ; and in the text of the book it is 
printed " Ducet (?)." The good taste of including 
the letters of " Maud Whistler " is perhaps open to 
question; and in always making Whistler refer to 
himself by name there is an implied intimation that

this was his customary manner of speech, whereas 
the truth is that such an aif ectation was most unlike 
him. For printing Whistler's own version of the 
well-known goldfish story, the ai'tist's friends owe 
Mr. Baclier a deht of gratitude. Even Mr. and Mrs. 
Pennell ascribe the exploit to Whistler himself. 
This ascription Mr. Bacher stigmatizes as a libel, 
and says the actual performer was a clever French- 
man, once Whistler's roommate in Paris. 

The late Grant Allen, who had a mind so many- 
sided and keenly sensitive to life in all its aspects 
that he has been described as " naturalist, anthro- 
pologist, physicist, historian, poet, novelist, essayist, 
and critic," always contrived to invest his chosen 
topics with fresh interest by considering them from 
some novel point of view. One of his early efforts 
was an investigation into the physiology of aesthetics, 
upon which he published a treatise in 1877. He 
was not an art critic in the oi'dinary sense of the 
term, but being compelled by ill-health to spend 
many winters in a climate less rigorous than that of 
England he had abundant opportunities for visiting 
Italian and other art galleries and utilized them in 
studies for which his early work had been a prepara- 
tion. The outcome of his observations was a series of 
papers in the " Pall Mall Gazette "and the " English 
Illustrated Magazine," which are now reprinted in 
a handsome volume with their original title, " Evolu- 
tion in Italian Art " (A. Wessels Co. ) . These papers, 
left practically complete at the author's death, have 
been revised and brought up to date by Mr. J. W. 
Cruickshank, who supj)lies a useful historical intro- 
duction. The novelty of Mr. Allen's treatment of 
the subject is in "the conception of the individual 
composition as an organic type evolving along lines 
of its own." Taking up the principal themes of the 
Italian painters, such as the Marriage of the Virgin, 
the Visitation, the Madonna, the Adoration of the 
Magi, etc., he shows that each picture should be 
viewed as a variant upon a central type, and that "the 
variations themselves follow fixed laws of develop- 
ment." This applies also to the separate figures of 
saints that appear in many different compositions. 
The conditions under which the early Italian artists 
worked made the course of evolution peculiai'ly 
direct. The artists themselves were free agents only 
to a very limited extent, receiving as a rule commis- 
sions for some definite work, such as a Transfigura- 
tion, or a Madonna and Child attended by certain 
specified saints, it even being required in many cases 
that the treatment should closely follow the repre- 
sentation of the same subject in such and such a 
picture by another hand. That Mr. Allen has proved 
his contention must be admitted. Incidentally, by 
the exercise of the close analysis and comparative 
method employed in scientific research, he throws 
light upon various items that help to better under- 
standing of the works of the primitive artists. His 
cogent argument is pleasant to read and by the aid 
of a large number of excellent illustrations is made 
easy to follow. Mr. Allen based his work on studies 
made in the Italian galleries during his many visits 



to Italy, and the illustrations represent the master- 
pieces of those great collections. 

A history of " British Water-Colour Painting," 
at once comprehensive, authoritative, and readable, 
is that of Mr. H. M. Cundall, published by Messrs. 
E. P. Button & Co. Fifty illustrations, beautifully 
reproduced in color by the best modern methods, 
both elucidate Mr. Cundall's descriptions and make 
of his book a sumptuous art volume. Mr. Cundall 
does not lay claim to any fresh discoveries, but his 
classification of the artists in water-color in eleven 
distinctive categories gives a new turn to the mate- 
rial ; and his appendices, containing lists of members 
of five great British Societies of water-color artists, 
wUl be of great value to students. The arrange- 
ment is by groups, and in general is chronological. 
The first chapters are devoted to miniature paint- 
ers and topographical draughtsmen, two branches of 
art little practised in the nineteenth century. Gir- 
tin, Turner, and Constable, forerunners of the En- 
glish landscape painters, are discussed together in an 
interesting chapter. Another discusses " The Influ- 
ence of Pre-Raphaelitism." Each Society is repre- 
sented by a chapter, and " The Last Decade of the 
Nineteenth Century " speaks of Whistler, and, in a 
very general way, of the Impressionistic School. 
Sane and balanced judgment, and careful economy 
of space by judicious selection from a wide field are 
the best points about Mr. Cundall's method. 

The high standard of excellence set in the earlier 
volumes of " The Art Galleries of Europe " series 
(L. C. Page & Co.) is fully maintained in "The 
Art of the Netherland Galleries," by Mr. David C. 
Preyer. Compelled by the nature of his material 
to adopt a method of treatment different from that 
followed in the rest of the series, the author, who is 
a Hollander by birth, has taken advantage of the 
circumstance that the great majority of the paint- 
ings in the galleries described are by Dutch artists, 
in order to present a complete history of Dutch art. 
Strange as it may seem, such a history has not be- 
fore appeared in English, nor in Dutch in the same 
completeness. Comparatively little information 
concerning the early painters is available, as most 
of their works perished during the two decades of 
the Spanish war and the fanatical outburst in 1566 
known as the "Image Storm." Even in the case 
of an artist so distinguished as Lukas van Leiden, 
only one easel picture was saved. But from the 
middle of the sixteenth century onward, the mate- 
rial is ample, and the list of artists who are repre- 
sented in the galleries of their native land is a long 
one. Many of these men are known chiefly by 
their works, few biographical details concerning 
them having survived. Mr. Preyer's account of 
these lesser men, as well as of their more noted 
fellows, is written with intelligence and discrimina- 
tion. The history is brought down to the present 
day, even the younger living artists being included 
in the purview. Following this section of the book, 
five chapters are devoted to "Walks through the 
Galleries." There is also a useful bibliography and

an index. The illustrations, which are reproduced 
in a pleasing sepia tone, in duogravure work of 
fine quality, are as distinguished in their way as 
is the text. 

Accurate scholarship and painstaking workman- 
ship are manifest throughout "A Short History of 
Engraving and Etching," by Mr. A. M. Hind of 
the British Museum, Department of Prints and 
Drawings. The scope of the book is unusually 
wide. The history of the art is traced from its 
earliest beginnings, and the course of its develop- 
ment is followed through all the countries of 
Europe, even present-day etchers and engravers 
being included in the survey. The views expressed 
are sound and conservative, and fairly represent 
the consensus of well-informed opinion. Consider- 
ing the necessity for terse statement to keep the 
work within the limits of a single volume, the 
amount of information given is surprisingly large. 
Extended comment upon individual men is pre- 
cluded, only the more eminent artists being treated 
with any fulness ; but the inadequacy in this respect 
is more than offset by the extensive bibliographies 
and compendious indexes that are provided. The 
students and collectors for whose use, according to 
the title-page, the book has been prepared, will find 
these of great value. They occupy no less than a 
hundred and thirty-one of the book's four hundred 
and seventy-three pages, and are alike admirable in 
substance and arrangement. The " Classified List of 
Engravers " supplies data about more than twenty- 
five hundred members of the craft, grouped by coun- 
tries. Following this is a " General Bibliogi'aphy," 
which the author claims is more ample than any 
similar list attempted in any other publication. 
There is also an "Index of Engravers and Indi- 
vidual Bibliographies " which serves as a general 
index to the book. Coupled with the names of the 
engravers in this latter index are the titles of publi- 
cations containing information concerning them and 
their works, a feature that will be appreciated by 
every student having occasion to consult the list. 
A considerable number of well-chosen illustra- 
tions add to the attractions of a most useful book, 
which is issued in this country by the Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

" Cathedrals and Churches of Northern Italy " 
by Mr. T. Francis Bumpus, the latest publication 
in the "Cathedral Series" (L. C. Page & Co.), 
might be described as an ornate hand-book, so closely 
does it combine the useful and the ornamental. An 
introductory chapter traces with unusual clearness 
the development of the cathedral from the Roman 
basilica. The remainder of the volume describes 
over one hundred cathedrals and churches, grouped 
according to location. A large mass of detail is 
condensed in the four hundred pages, for to com- 
ments on architecture, paintings, and mural decora- 
tions is added more or less of the history of build- 
ings, architects, and bishops. Most of the technical 
matter is clear enough to be easily understood by 
the novice in art-study ; and this is saying much for 



a writer who deals in apses, pilasters, ambons, bald- 
achinos, and such-like " ecclesiological " material. To 
the ordinary reader, however, and to students not 
intending an early pilgrimage to these shrines, the 
more general comments will appeal with greater 
force ; and these are many and valuable. The fail- 
ure of Italian architects to master the Pointed 
Gothic, the prevalence of great unfenestrated wall 
spaces, the scarcity of stained glass, and other pre- 
dominant features of Italian churches are logically 
accounted for. The book closes with a list of pictures 
and wall-paintings in the churches described, which 
will be a convenience to students. Over thirty 
photogravures are placed well for further elucida- 
tion of the text. The light covers with ecclesiasti- 
cal designs in red and gold, elaborate cover linings, 
and marginal traceries of sacred emblems around 
the illustrations, give the volume a sumptuous 
churchly look. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. have inaugurated a 
remarkably attractive series of " Little Books on Art " 
with four volumes — " Enamels," by Mrs. Nelson 
Dawson ; " Miniatures, Ancient and Modern," and 
" Jewelry," by Mr. Cyril Davenport ; and " Book- 
plates," by Mr. Edward Almack. Each volume is 
fully illustrated, the frontispiece being in color ; 
and their small size and simple but attractive bind- 
ing suggest their suitability as gifts for those whose 
interests centre in the artistic handicrafts. The text 
is necessarily general in scope, but it is in each case 
authoritative, comprehensive, and readable, — in- 
tended for amateurs in search of accurate informa- 
tion which is not too technical for the amateur 
understanding. 

Books of Travel and Description. 

Lovers of Dr. van Dyke's books — and what 
reader of them is not a lover ? — will rejoice that 
their number is increased by a record of the author's 
recent journey to Palestine. The volume is entitled 
"Out-of-doors in the Holy Land" (Scribner), and 
is bound uniformly with others by the same author. 
The conventionalized design of the cover suggests 
the " flowers of the field," and the unusually beauti- 
ful illustrations, in delicate pastel tints, are such as 
might adorn a much more expensive book. Dr. 
van Dyke has discovered that "Christianity is an 
out-of-doors religion," and journeys in the faith that 
" the shut-in shrines and altered memorials are less 
significant than what we find in the open, among 
the streets and on the surrounding hill-sides." His 
"impressions of travel in body and spirit" (his 
sub-title) are therefore not heavy with human creeds 
and contentions, but breathe the spirit of the land 
itself. His writing always combines poetry, religion, 
and the love of nature, and this threefold felicity 
could not be more appropriately displayed than in 
celebrating the birthplace of Christianity. From the 
" city that is lifted up " to the Sea of Galilee, 
" sleeping in still, forsaken beauty among the shelter- 
ing hills, and open to the cloudless sky which makes 
its water like a little heaven," his descriptions of

these long-loved places are at once refreshing and 
reverent. Psalm-like, unrhymed songs at the close 
of each chapter, beautiful enough to deserve publica- 
tion as a book of poems, recall " The Welcome Tent," 
"The Distant Road," "The Unseen Altar," and 
other memories of the journey. 

If we cannot quite apply the poet's words to Mr. 
Robert Hichens and say of him that he has seen the 
mystery hid under Egypt's pyramid, we can at 
least admit that he has potently felt that mystery in 
his recent re-visit to the " land of sand, and ruins, 
and gold," after an absence of fourteen years. In 
a large octavo, nothing short of luxurious in its 
appointments, entitled " Egypt and its Monuments " 
(The Century Co.), he writes of the pyramids and 
the sphinx, of the colossi of Memnon and the tombs 
of the kings, of Cairo and Karnak and Luxor and 
the Nile, with a rich accompaniment of full-page 
illustrations from the camera, and from the brush of 
Mr. Jules Gu^rin. The size of these illustrations, 
corresponding with the ample page and the large 
print, makes the book an impressive work of art. 
To be sure, the brilliant greens and yellows, reds 
and blues, of the reproduced paintings are a wide 
remove from nature and realism ; but probably they 
express the spirit and the spell of the scene better 
than do the severely literal photographs that accom- 
pany them. Of the sixty pictures, twenty are of 
Mr. Gu^rin's execution and in his well-known style. 
The eighteen leisurely chapters of the volume have 
nothing suggestive of the guide-book about them. 
It is the fascination of the country, and not its hotels 
and routes of travel, that the author of " The Garden 
of Allah " has dwelt upon, and not a few of the thou- 
sands who now every year visit Egypt will find 
pleasure and stimulus in his pages. 

With that genially serious attention to minute 
details, that humorous circumstantiality in treating 
the commonplace, which we have all come to know 
so well and to like (or dislike) so heartily in Mr. 
Howells, he has filled a substantial volume with his 
easily-flowing narrative of a Mediterranean vacation 
journey, naming his book " Roman Holidays and 
Others" (Harper). The first landing of his party 
was made at Madeira, whence they proceeded to 
Gibraltar, and then to Genoa, Naples, Rome, Leg- 
horn, Pisa, Genoa again, and Monte Carlo. The 
style of the narrative — if it is necessary to indicate 
it at all — is well illustrated by the opening words 
of the second chapter : " There is nothing strikes 
the traveller in his approach to the rock of Gibraltar 
so much as its resemblance to the trade-mark of the 
Prudential Insurance Company. He cannot help 
feeling that the famous stronghold is pictorially a 
plagiarism from the advertisements of that institu- 
tion." Mr. Howells says of the present-day Romans 
that they have " a republican simplicity of manner, 
and I liked this better in the shop people and work 
people than the civility overflowing into servility 
which one finds among the like folk, for instance, in 
England." The great number of half-tone illustra- 
tions, done in a pleasing brownish tint that suggests 



etching, are a feature of the book, which in general 
appearance is uniform with Mr. Howells's other 
recent volumes of travel and comment. 

"The motor-car has restored the romance of 
travel." Thus alluringly does Mrs. Edith Wharton 
begin her account of " A Motor-Flight through 
France" (Scribner). One may question the truth 
of her statement, feeling that a mad rush along 
dusty roads, past flying scenery and frightened 
peasants, has little of the " restored " charm of the 
old post-chaise. But the further one reads, the 
less he is inclined to dispute with Mrs. Wharton. 
Motoring may not strike the average person as 
a romantic means of transit, but she finds it so. 
It makes possible the quick transitions, the easy 
blotting out of non-essentials, in the fashion best 
suited to her impatient, restive, and luxury-loving 
temperament. It snatches her from a cathedral 
door, drops her before a chateau in the next village, 
blurs all impressions between save the few great 
moments, and leaves those distinct, etched on a 
background of flying clouds. It furnishes bird's-eye 
views, salient yet subtle pictures, simple because 
their complexity is too deep to do more than fasci- 
nate the eye of " the woman in the car." So, while 
most automobile tourists see nothing, Mrs. Wharton, 
with a mind extraordinarily alert, sees the gist of 
everything, and fully justifies her initial hypothesis. 
Her sketches appeared originally in the "Atlantic 
Monthly," of course without illustrations. In book 
form they are supplemented by a very generous 
allowance of excellent photographs, and the gain in 
readability is very great. Readers who enjoy style, 
readers who are fond of automobile riding, readers 
who are interested in rural France, whether for its 
art, its architecture, or its landscape, will enjoy 
Mrs. Wharton's book. 

A sumptuous and — what is more — highly read- 
able volume entitled "Florida Enchantments" has 
been written by Messrs. A. W. and Julian A. 
Dimock, and published with almost innumerable 
illustrations from photographs, by the Outing Pub- 
lishing Co. The pictures, however, are not strictly 
numberless ; there are 120 of them, all large plates 
to match the generous pages of the book. Accounts 
of crocodile-hunting, tarpon-fishing, canoeing in the 
surf, searching for wild honey (and finding it), 
crossing the everglades in a power boat, capturing 
a sea-cow, intercourse with the Seminoles, and other 
more or less thrilling adventures, fill the volume in 
a manner acceptable to the reader, adventurous or 
unadventurous. The book is not the inspiration of 
a moment. " Florida the Fascinating," writes one 
of the authors at the beginning, " cast the spell of 
her witchery upon me many years ago. I felt it 
then, I know it now. We were sailing, my family 
and I, up the lovely Hermosassa and approaching 
the little islet which sentinels the small bay that 
fronts on Tiger Tail Island, once the home of the 
famous Seminole, afterward the manor of the late 
David L. Yulee, and at the time of which I write, 
a realized Utopia." The annual migration to Florida

is at hand. The book would be an excellent one 
to read before going, or on the way, or even after 
arriving there. 

The Chinese character is a veritable Chinese 
puzzle to us, and any contribution toward its solu- 
tion is welcome. Mr. J. Macgowan, of the London 
Missionary Society, and author of previous works 
on China, has given us, in his " Sidelights on Chinese 
Life" (Lippincott), a series of informing and in- 
teresting chapters on such subjects as the family life 
of the people, child life, servants, amusements, the 
farmer, the mandarin, schools and school-masters 
and school-books, religious forces, the seamy side 
of Chinese life, and other matters of which he has 
intimate personal knowledge. The book is well 
made, has an outside wrapper of cloth, an agreeably 
flexible binding, and numerous illustrations — twelve 
of them in color, the others in the familiar but ser- 
viceable half-tone. The colored views, landscapes 
' chiefly, are so gaudily tinted as to be caricatures of 
nature, unless nature's aspect in China is utterly 
unlike her appearance in western lands. In view 
of recent noteworthy occurrences in the Celestial 
Kingdom, and the prospect of still more noteworthy 
ones to follow, this authoritative account of condi- 
tions there prevailing should minister to a natural 
and legitimate curiosity on the part of readers. 

A more readable book of travel than Mr. Clifton 
Johnson's " Highways and Byways of the Pacific 
Coast" (Macmillan) is not often published. Jour- 
neying with his camera from the Mexican to the 
Canadian frontier along the coast and as far inland as 
Arizona, Nevada, and Idaho, this experienced " high- 
way and byway " traveller and author has contrived 
to encounter a good many interesting experiences, 
to see many unusual sights, and to meet and talk 
with a number of highly original and entertaining 
characters. As in other volumes of the series, he 
has described the rurally picturesque and typical, 
and has avoided the urbanly conventional and unin- 
teresting. The difficulty of getting into close and 
vmconventional contact with the people, he has 
admirably surmounted, and his book abounds in racy 
talk from the unspoiled rustics he has met. This 
abundance of conversation gives his pages a human 
interest and an inviting appearance not found in the 
ordinary book of travel. To make his chapters 
more serviceable to intending travellers over the same 
route, Mr. Johnson has continued his previous prac- 
tice of appending to each a useful note of desirable 
information. The sixty-three full-page illustrations 
from the author's photographs are excellent ; and 
the binding and type are all that one could ask for 
in such a work. 

Much in the manner of her " Roma Beata " and 
'' Two in Italy," Mrs. Maud Howe Elliott has given 
her impressions of " Sun and Shadow in Spain " 
(Little, Brown & Co.) in chapters that treat of 
Gibraltar, Seville, Cordova, Granada, Tangiers, 
Madrid, Toledo, the Carnival, the King's wedding, 
and various other interesting matters, all profusely 
illustrated with half-tones and colored drawings. 



An abundance of conversation gives the pages an 
inviting appearance, while there is enough of serious 
attention to art and architecture and matters of his- 
toric interest to preserve the book from the charge 
of frivolity. It is pleasant to read, apropos of an 
incident illustrative of Spanish courtesy : " I think 
this could not happen outside of Spain, the most 
democratic of all countries. Here every man is 
equal, not merely in the law's eye, but — what 's far 
more important — in his own eyes, and proves it by 
allowing no other man to show, better manners than 
he." This speech is put into the mouth of one of 
the characters of the book. For promoting a more 
intimate understanding and a warmer friendship 
between Americans and Spaniards, this attractive 
picture of the land and its people is likely to do 
good service, besides affording considerable enter- 
tainment. 

Picturesque Ireland is very agreeably presented, 
with pen and camera, in Mr. Plummer F. Jones's 
" Shamrock-Land" (Moffat, Yard & Co.), which has 
just enough of historical and statistical information 
to be useful without being tiresome, and a wealth 
of personal observation and experience that make 
excellent reading. The people, lively, emotional, 
keen of wit, receive sympathetic treatment at the 
author's hands, and on the whole appear to be light- 
hearted, kindly disposed to all the world, and living 
their lives with admirable heartiness. Of the gentler 
sex we read : " Perhaps no other women of the 
world have just that piquancy and vivacity of man- 
ner which characterizes the women of Ireland. 
There is an animation, a force of manner, a spon- 
taneity of expression which makes them attractive 
in the extreme. One cannot come in contact with 
them without feeling that with the proper environ- 
ments they might furnish the woi'ld a type of the 
perfect woman." In seeking places of interest and 
scenes of beauty, of course the author visited Lissoy 
( now better known as Auburn, Goldsmith's Deserted 
Village), the Lakes of Killarney, Blarney Castle, 
the Giant's Causeway, the Golden Vale of Tipper- 
ary, and other inviting districts. Of the sorrows of 
Ireland he refrains from speaking, nor do they seem 
to have obtruded themselves very painfully upon 
him. There is much more of the sunshine of the 
Celtic temperament than of its occasional gloom in 
this study of Pat and his Emerald Isle. The pic- 
tures are excellent, as is in fact the entire workman- 
ship of the volume. 

Between the English " trippers " and the travel- 
ling Americans, England is pretty well tourist- 
ridden ; so that Mr. Henry C. Shelley's title for his 
book of sketches — " Untrodden English Ways " — 
provokes at once both interest and apprehension. 
Investigation proves the title, in some cases at 
least, unwarranted ; surely Bath, the Poets' Corner at 
Westminster, and the graves of Thackeray and of 
George Eliot, are not unvisited by tourists. On 
the other hand, St. Ives and its artist colony, Inver- 
ary Castle, Hursley with its relics of John Keble, 
historic Witney, and many other spots described

by Mr. Shelley, are mere names to most travellers 
in England or to readers of books of English travel. 
Mr. Shelley's style is easy and readable, bespeaking 
intimate acquaintance both with the subject in hand 
and with the "untrodden ways" of English litera- 
ture. Pictures in color and line from the work of 
Mr. H. C. Colby, and reproductions of photographs 
taken by the author, furnish a varied and beautiful 
adjunct to the text. (Little, Brown & Co.) 

General interest in the preservation of Niagara 
Falls makes not untimely Mr. Archer Butler Hul- 
bert's elaborate descriptive and historical work on 
"The Niagara River" (Putnam). By a reversal 
of what would seem to be the more natural method, 
he has, in his first six chapters, considered the 
Niagara of the present, with its problems and inter- 
ests, while in his concluding six he dwells on the 
history of the region and some of its heroes. His 
sixth chapter, " A Century of Niagara Cranks," is 
an entertaining review of the many tight-rope- 
walking and cataract-shooting performances by 
which a raging thirst for fame has sought to assuage 
itself. Chapter V., on " Harnessing Niagara Falls," 
has an even greater interest — to the practical, 
utilitarian mind. The illustrations throughout are 
good, the winter scenes being especially beautiful. 
The ample page permits most effective work of this 
sort. In mechanical execution, as well as in liter- 
ary style, the volume has decided merits. 

Standard Literature in Holiday Form. 

Thoreau's popularity as an author has greatly 
increased since he died in 1862 at the age of forty- 
four, with only two published books to his credit. 
Since then the publication of even his informal diaries, 
with all their imperfections of form and repetitions 
of thought, seems to indicate that the world can never 
have enough of that keen-witted Yankee dreamer of 
Concord. Emphatically worthy of this posthumous 
publication, however, was his " Cape Cod," which 
appeared in print three years after the writer's death 
and has gone through many editions. An unusually 
attractive reprint of the work, prefaced and fully 
illustrated by Mr. Clifton Johnson, is now issued by 
Crowell & Co. The illustrations, thirty-three in num- 
ber, are from photographs taken at different points 
along the identical route travelled by Thoreau, and 
in the same month of October to which his descrip- 
tions mainly refer — although his book was the fruit 
of more than one pilgrimage over those shifting sands. 
So delightfully slow of progress, so sturdUy tenacious 
of the tried and tested, are the good people of the 
Cape that we may safely assure ourselves that we are 
looking out, through Mr. Johnson's camera, on very 
much the same scenes as met Thoreau's shrewdly 
observant scrutiny half a century ago. The typog- 
raphy of this edition is large and clear, a luxury to 
failing eyes ; and the binding is not only handsome, 
but strong and flexible. 

The charm of " Marjorie Daw " was so irresistible 
when first she gleamed upon our sight — a lovely 
apparition sent to be a moment's ornament — that 



the story was immediately translated into several 
foreign tongues and even enjoyed the honor of repub- 
lication in the Revue des Deux Mondes. That was 
a generation ago. Now, for the first time, and in 
suitable accompaniment to Aldrich's biography, his 
little masterpiece appears in a volume by itself 
(Houghton), with colored illustrations by Mr. John 
Cecil Clay. Heavy paper, wide margins, and very 
large type (great primer, or nearly that) combine to 
make a fairly large book out of the story — which, 
as some may recall, was first printed in " The 
Atlantic Monthly " for April, 1873. The drawings 
would be better without the splashes of color ; but 
they help to a better conception of the characters, 
especially of the incorporeal heroine. 

It is surprising how long it took for " Lorna 
Doone," first published in 1869, to struggle into 
anything like popularity. It had been on the mar- 
ket three years when a chance association or confu- 
sion of Lorna's name with that of the marquis who 
had lately wedded the much loved Princess Louise 
brought the book into general notice and caused it 
to be read. It had been rejected, as Blackmore 
himself has written, by all the magazines and by 
many publishers ; yet as soon as the great reading 
public became aware of its existence, the demand 
for it kept the printing-presses busy. The author's 
account of the rise and prosperity of his masterpiece, 
as contained in his preface to the twentieth edition, 
is quoted in part by Mr. H. Snowden Ward in his 
fifty-page introduction to the " Doone-land edition," 
which is published in this country by the Harpers. 
Much has already been made known concerning this 
elaborate re-issue of the book, — its topograhical and 
antiquarian and historical features, as supplied by 
the zealous editor's pen ; and its equally elaborate 
pictorial embellishment, as furnished by the indus- 
trious Mrs. Ward's camera. It is hard to see how 
the work could have been better done. The numer- 
ous views, even the wide landscapes, have an admir- 
able clearness and finish. The editor's lore will 
please the curious, and will be at least skimmed by 
the indifferent and careless. The exigencies of a 
one-volume edition have necessitated rather small 
type and a somewhat crowded page ; otherwise the 
appearance of the book is excellent. 

Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons have anticipated 
the Poe centenary by issuing a sumptuous illustrated 
edition of the " Complete Poems of Edgar Allan 
Poe," with a critical introduction by Professor 
Charles F. Richardson, and pictures, reproduced in 
photogravure, as well as ornamental head-pieees and 
tail-pieces in line, by Mr. Frederick Simpson Coburn. 
Nothing could be worse than Poe badly illustrated; 
but those who know Mr. Coburn's style will feel no 
doubt of his competence. The simple, sensuous, 
mystical, yet picturesque quality of Poe's verse, its 
elegant aloofness, contrasted with its human thrill, 
are all suggested in the photogravures. The head- 
ings, symbolical or merely decorative, and a taste- 
ful cover design in gold, carry out the effect of 
decoration.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



A decidedly inviting edition of Sterne's "Senti- 
mental Journey," with an engraving of Joshua Rey- 
nolds's portrait of the author, and a great number of 
line drawings by Mr. T. H. Robinson, comes from 
the press of J. B. Lippincott Co. The little story, 
without the impertinence of an introduction, has been 
so treated by printer and illustrator that it spins its 
slender length through 442 pages (including those 
that are blank and those that contain pictures only ) , 
But it is meet that this leisurely stage-coach ramble 
through France and Italy should, in its telling, pre- 
sent no appearance of stress or hurry, or vulgar con- 
sideration of the value of economy, whether of time 
or space. The drawings are spirited, the print 
delightfully uncrowded and legible, and the binding 
is evidently designed for wear even more than for 
looks. 

To the " Thumb-nail Series" of small but dis- 
tinguished reprints The Century Co. has this year 
added two titles — Keats 's " Odes, Sonnets, and 
Lyrics," with a preface by Edmund Clarence Sted- 
man and a note by Mr. Richard Watson Gilder; 
and Emerson's essays on Power, Success, and Great- 
ness, with an introductory appreciation, also by 
Mr. Gilder. Both volumes have portrait frontis- 
pieces, and embossed leather covers specially designed 
for them by Mrs. Blanche McManus Mansfield. 

The newest volume in the "English Idylls " series, 
with a dainty binding and colored illustrations 
after designs by Mr. C. E. Brock, is Miss Austen's 
"Mansfield Park" (Dent-Dutton). This is the 
fourth of Miss Austen's novels to be reprinted in 
the series, for which their old-time humor, with its 
wide scope for the illustrator's art, makes them 
particularly well suited. 

Miscellaneous Gift Books. 
It is dangerous to use superlatives about any 
particular holiday book, especially this year when 
the publishers have vied with one another, as it 
seems, to produce luxurious effects. But if not the 
most sumptuous, one of the most sumptuous and 
artistic publications of the season is " The Book of the 
Pearl" (Century Co.). The volume is royal quarto 
size, and the cover-design shows a net-work of gold 
filagree inset with pearls. The illustrations, of which 
there are over one hundred, are in photogravure, 
color, tint, and black-and-white. They include por- 
traits of famous women wearing superb pearls, pic- 
tures of crown jewels, of notable stones, and of jewels 
with unusual settings or adapted to unusual uses, be- 
sides scenes from the pearl fisheries throughout the 
world. The text is the joint production of Dr. 
George Frederick Kunz and Dr. Charles Hugh 
Stevenson, one the gem expert of Tiffany & Co., 
the other a statistician of acknowledged authority. 
It touches upon every conceivable phase of the sub- 
ject: the artistic uses of pearls in all ages; their 
pictorial values ; all obtainable facts and many 
theories concerning their origin, growth, and struc- 
ture ; their commercial value ; their mystical and 
medicinal properties ; the proper way to preserve 



their beauty ; the history of the pearl-fishing indus- 
try in all parts of the world and its methods ; the 
necessity of husbanding the natural resources for 
pearls and the possibilities of their artificial culture. 
In short, there is nothing to know about pearls that 
may not be found somewhere in the six hundred 
pages of " The Book of the Pearl." Encyclopaedic 
in character, and representing an appalling amount 
of the most laborious research, the book is neverthe- 
less thoroughly readable — a strong proof of the 
patience and genuine interest of the authors in their 
work. It would doubtless require a very strong 
interest in the subject to cause any reader to go 
through the whole book in sequence ; but whatever 
the ground of his attraction to the pearl he can find 
much to elucidate it, and once having begun to read 
it is safe to say that he will not soon stop. The his- 
tory of the pearl fisheries reads like a romance. The 
account of the supposedly mystical qualities of the 
queen of gems, from the first reference in the 
Atharvaveda, at least 2400 years ago, to the al- 
most contemporary recommendation of pearls as a 
medicinal cure-all, by a native Indian prince, makes 
a fascinating chapter. Readers who do not care 
for mysticism may turn to the following chapter, a 
very practical account of the money-value of pearls. 
No more beautiful gift than this could be desired, 
either for lovers and owners of pearls, or for lovers 
of fine book-making. 

An imposing quarto over which a lover of gardens 
might dream by day or night is entitled " Gardens 
Old and New," and is the third in the series called 
" The Country House and its Garden Environment " 
(Scribner). The work is, first of all, a gallery of 
garden views, and contains about four hundred half- 
tones from photographs by Mr. Charles Latham, 
many of them full-page in size and all of them fas- 
cinating in subject. The thirty gardens chosen for 
this royal noticing are either English or Welsh, and 
are situated between Newton Ferrers, Cornwall, and 
Bramham Park, Yorksliire. To make it possible for 
stay-at-homes to imagine truly the historic box-maze 
and ancient cedars of Wilton, the Italian terraces of 
Bowood, the immemorial yews of Gayhurst, the rose 
garden of Treworgey, the gorgeous parterres of 
Holland House, the broad lawns across which rise 
the turrets of Hatfield, and many other scenes of 
delight, — this is what these pictures accomplish. 
The text, though subordinate, is not at all a mere 
sign-post. An introduction, presumably by the editor, 
Mr. H. Avray Tipping, records the characteristics of 
English gardens both humble and aristocratic from 
the time when Markham timidly suggested the separ- 
ation of flowers and vegetables because " your Gar- 
den flowers shall suffer some disgrace if among them 
you intermingle Onions, Parsnips " etc., through the 
times when "Capability" Brown destroyed the 
beautiful past to make room for his " artificially 
natural serpentines," up to the present, with its 
encouraging harmony of nature and art. The chap- 
ters supply much information about the architecture 
of the houses and the history of the families who

occupy them, besides pointing out detailed beauties 
of the gardens which might otherwise escape obser- 
vation. The volume is bound in dark blue cloth 
with elaborate Renaissance decorations in gilt, and 
forms a notable addition to garden literature. 

In a lavishly illustrated quarto which he en- 
titles " Historic Houses and their Gardens " (John 
Winston Co.), Mr. Charles Francis Osborne has 
brought together descriptions of over thirty of the 
world's most famous dwelling-places, from Tokio to 
Mount Vernon. A brief introduction by Mr. Frank 
Miles Day states some principles of garden archi- 
tecture which are worth remembering. Mr. P. H. 
Ditchfield contributes six of the chapters, and some 
twenty writers furnish the others ; so that the essays 
are interesting from variety of personal predilec- 
tion and view-point as well as subject. A scholarly 
study of ancient Roman country houses, elucidated 
by many sketches, is supplied by Professor Hamlin 
of Columbia University, and an ingenious compar- 
ison of the mediaeval and modern plans of the Taj 
Mahal gardens is made by Mr. Havell. National 
characteristics shown in landscape gardening are 
pointed out in chapters on Indian, Persian, and 
Mexican gardens — such, for example, as the pre- 
eminence of the Grand Moguls in " the art of plan- 
ning and planting gardens in direct harmonious 
relation to the house, palace, or mausoleum to which 
they belonged." The descriptions are all brief, 
occupying much less space than the illustrations. 
Whether accidentally or not, it has come about 
that those of English places, Blenheim, Moor Park, 
Claydon, Stowe, and Warwick, are given almost 
wholly to the houses, their histories and occupants, 
while those of Italian and Spanish villas are chiefly 
concerned with the gardens. And no wonder these 
gardens monopolize attention ! The only wonder 
is that people who could wander through such 
vistas as the pictiires show, beside such fountains 
and parterres, and feast their eyes on such visions 
of distant mountain and valley, should ever have 
cared to build houses at all. Would anyone who 
found his feet on the hedged ramps of vine-clad 
terraces of the Villa Lante, or among the mosses 
and ferns of the Villa D'Este, where "man has 
created where Nature does not provide, but with 
Nature as his perception," ever care to enter even a 
palace in which '' there are servants and furniture"? 
Yet when one comes to think of them, these lordly 
pleasure palaces all have their own beauty, ranging 
from the ornate harmony of the Spanish arcade and 
the airy lightness of the Indian pavilion to the gray 
solidity of the English keep. The book will bring 
travellers' joy, whether reminiscent or imaginary, 
to those who turn its pages. 

A series of unusual distinction, both in subject- 
matter and as examples of artistic book-making, is 
" The New Mediaeval Library " of Messrs. Duffield 
& Co. The series makes its advent this fall with 
five volumes. Its object is to offer reprints, in 
translation, of the choicest mediaeval romances and 
other interesting works, especially those that are 



little known to modern readers. The mediaeval 
note is emphasized by the antique style of binding, 
in brown pigskin with metal clasps. The texts are 
clearly printed on pure linen paper, and illustrated 
with photogravure or wood-cut reproductions of the 
original illustrations contained in old editions of the 
work reprinted. But the mechanical perfection of 
the series is no more alluring than befits the delight- 
ful works chosen for reprint, and the fine and dis- 
criminating quality of the editorial work and the 
translation. " Of the Tumbler of Our Lady, and 
Other Miracles" has been translated from the 
Middle French, with a sympathetic introduction, by 
Miss Alice Kemp-Welch. Miss Kemp- Welch is 
also the translator of the fifteenth century French 
romance by Christine de Pisan, " The Book of the 
Duke of True Lovers," The ballads which occur 
in the old tale are translated in the original metres 
by Messrs. Laurence Binyon and Eric R. D. Mac- 
lagan. "The Chatelaine of Vergi," a thirteenth 
century romance, also translated by Miss Kemp- 
Welch, is short enough so that the original French 
text has been reprinted after the translation. Mr. 
L. Brandin furnishes a delightful introduction for 
this volume. " The Legend of the Holy Fina, Virgin 
of Santo Gimignano" is a thirteenth-century Italian 
legend chronicled by Fra Giovanni di Coppo. It is 
translated and furnished with preface and notes by 
Mr. M. Mansfield. Quaintest of all, perhaps, is 
"The Babees' Book: Mediaeval Manners for the 
Young," done into modern English from Dr. Furni- 
vall's texts by Miss Edith Rickert. These curious 
codes of good behavior form the intricate basis for 
the whole fabric of the mediaeval romances, so that 
their intrinsic human interest is heightened by their 
relation to the social organization and the literature 
of their time. Each of these little books will be 
treasured by those who appreciate rare things, culled 
in literary by-paths and fittingly presented. 

That Madame Mary King Waddington knows 
her Paris perfectly, we have already learned from 
her "Letters of a Diplomat's Wife." That she 
also knows her rural France almost as well is now 
made clear in a fresh book of very agreeable descrip- 
tion and anecdote, entitled " Chateau and Country 
Life in France" (Scribner). Sojourns at various 
country places in different parts of France are 
described in the author's now well-known style ; and 
illustrations, sketchy and suggestive rather than de- 
tailed and finished, help to place us amid the scenes 
and characters successively chosen for our entertain- 
ment. As a sample of the book's quality, this pass- 
ing pen-portrait of the dowager Comtesse de Florian, 
at whose chateau on the outskirts of Valognes the 
writer was hospitably entertained, is good: "She 
does n't take much interest in the outside world, nor 
in anything that goes on in other countries, but is 
too polite to show that when she talks to me, for 
instance, who have knocked about so much. She 
doesn't understand the modern life, so sans gene and 
agitated, and it is funny to hear her say, when talk- 
ing of people she doesn't quite approve of, ' lis ne

sont pas de notre monde.' " Speaking of the pres- 
ent Marquis de Lafayette, great-grandson of the 
famous Lafayette, she says : " There is something 
in perfectly well-bred French people of a certain 
class that one never sees in any other nationality. 
Such refinement and charm of manner — a great 
desire to put every one at their ease and to please 
the person with whom they are thrown for the 
moment." It is the human element in Mme. Wad- 
dington's book, rather than her references to archi- 
tecture and landscape, that makes it especially 
enjoyable. 

To Mr. Francis Gribble the love affairs of cele- 
brated characters are extremely important and 
worthy of the minutest study and the most pains- 
taking research. The follies of their unguarded 
moments shall not be suffered to lapse into chari- 
table oblivion if he can help it. Having already 
given us the details of Madame de Stall's and of 
George Sand's unlicensed loves, he now selects still 
another French character for similar treatment.

for this new life in English of one whom Mr. John 
Morley (as we still like to call his lordship) has 
made the subject of an excellent biographical study, 
is sought for in the recent discovery and publica- 
tion, by certain delvers in French archives and 
private papers, of many letters and other documents 
that throw new light on the philosopher's idiosyn- 
crasies and demonstrate the palpable untruth of cer- 
tain portions of his own autobiography. If one is 
interested in Rousseau's life — and who can help 
being more or less interested ? — it is better to have 
the real facts than falsehoods ; and so Mr. Gribble 
has rendered a not unuseful service. 

The fresh-looking green covers of Mr. Stanton 
Davis Kirkham's "In the Open" (Elder) give 
promise of a spring-like quality in the book Avhich 
the reading of it finds fulfilled. The author is quite 
capable of the more wintry acumen of scientific pre- 
cision, as is proved by his remarkable account of a 
battle between red and black ants. But one feels 
that the scientific spirit is secondary with him and 
that his mood is first of all that of gentle responsive- 
ness to Nature's " perpetual invitation." '' To count 
among his friends the birds and flowers and trees " 
is his ambition. Through intimate companionship 
he reaches a power of delicate characterization 
unique even among trained nature-lovers. To his 
eye the beech in the winter woods is a " stripped 
athlete, every muscle and sinew in evidence "; the 
stones of a New England pasture " are almost as 
individual in appearance as men." To his ear '' the 
brook seems as if inhabited by a number of spirits 
throughout its length, some whispering, some laugh- 
ing, others singing." He feels in the forest " imper- 
turbable calm, that stable equilibrium of the granite 
ledge and the great tree trunks "; and adds, " the 



forest has its luxuries, and they consist, in a meas- 
ure, of freedom from those things considered lux- 
uries in the city." In the moimtains, he says, " one 
would better wander alone, for in our deepest 
moments the mountains are company enough." 
His readers will often pay him the subtle compli- 
ment of exclaiming, " That is just what I have 
thought." The book has several dainty half-tone 
illustrations, and a beautiful frontispiece, after a 
painting by Louis Agassiz Fuertes, which fixes in 
color that vision never clearly enough seen in real 
life, a wedge of wild geese in full flight. 

No city in America is richer in historic associar 
tions than Boston. Miss Mary Caroline Crawford, 
already known for her studies in New England his- 
tory and antiquities, has prepared a work, full of 
zealous research and written in an agreeable style, 
on " St. Botolph's Town " (L. C. Page & Co. ). It 
is especially the human and personal element that 
appeals to her in reviewing the past, and so she has 
given considerable space to Winthrop and Vane, to 
Samuel Sewall and the two Mathers, to Anne Hutch- 
inson and Dorothy Quincy, and to other picturesque 
or otherwise interesting characters of that olden time. 
" History," she says in her preface, " seems to me 
worse than useless unless it illustrates the times of 
which it writes as those times affected the lives of 
its men and women. A book like this has no justi- 
fication, to my mind, save as it makes us understand 
just a little better the part New England, in the 
person of its chief town, has played in the mighty 
drama of nations made up of thinking, feeling men 
and women." The many illustrations from old paint- 
ings and engravings reproduce the persons and places 
treated, and a map of 1722 strikingly demonstrates 
how little of the present city stands upon soil that 
was in existence when the waters were gathered 
together unto one place and the dry land appeared. 
The book is clearly printed on substantial paper of a 
creamy yellow tint, and the binding is appropriately 
decorated. 

For moral uplift and sane optimism, Dr. Henry 
van Dyke's essays are of acknowledged excellence. 
In a little volume called " Counsels by the Way " 
(Crowell) are reprinted nine of his best productions 
of this sort, selected from the still smaller booklets 
that the same publishers have brought out in the last 
few years, and that have met with deserved favor. 
A prefatory note explains that " the little gift books 
containing single essays may still be had as for- 
merly," but that requests for a single volume suit- 
able for the library has induced the publishers to 
issue the present collection. The subject matter of 
the several essays is indicated by the titles, — 
"Pilgrims of the Sea," "Whither Bound?" "The 
Haven of Work," "The Haven of Character," 
"The Last Port," "The Poetry of the Psalms," 
"Joy and Power," "The Battle of Life," and 
" The Good Old Way." The book is well printed 
and of pleasing aspect. 

"My Lady of the Fog" (Lippincott) is one of 
Mr. Ralph Henry Barbour's characteristically light 



1908.] 



THE DIAL

and whimsical romances. Beginning four or five 
years ago with " Kitty of the Roses," Mr. Barbour 
has written a novelette a year, each more original 
in plot and better finished than its predecessors. 
The " Lady of the Fog " is lost off the coast from 
Gloucester, and rescued by a stranger, who is, as it 
turns out, an employee in one of her mines in the 
West. And in the end the foreign count who has 
been looking for an heiress finds that he has to 
look further. Twelve illustrations in color, by Mr. 
Clarence F. Underwood, and dainty page borders, 
also in color, by Mr. Edward Stratton HoUoway, 
make the story the prettiest possible sort of Christmas 
remembrance. 

One cannot see the title of Miss Helen A. Clarke's 
recent volume, " Browning's England " ( Baker & 
Taylor Co.) without thinking of Mr. Winter's 
"Shakespeare's England," and wondering if the 
new book is analogous to the old. As a matter of 
fact, there is scarcely any resemblance between the 
two, for Miss Clarke's is a book of literary criticism 
pure and simple. This is confined to poems which 
are at least partly English in inspiration — hence 
the title ; and as their number is considerable and 
most of them are quoted entire, the volume is of 
appreciable size. Studies which furnish new and 
valuable material are made of such subjects as these : 
the poet's early adoration of Shelley and Keats ; his 
feeling toward Wordsworth, and toward Shake- 
speare ; the historical background of " Strafford," 
and the social aspect of " A Blot in the 'Scutcheon "; 
the relations which various Englishmen bear to 
some of the poems — Alfred Domett to " Waring," 
Bunyan to " Ned Bratts," and so forth. A charm- 
ing portrait of Browning serves as frontispiece, 
and numerous illustrations recall the persons and 
places mentioned. 

With "The Open Road," "The Friendly Town," 
and "The Gentlest Art," Mr. E. V. Lucas has 
achieved an enviable position as artistic compiler. 
This year he has edited " The Ladies' Pageant " 
(MacmiUan), a collection, as delightful as the rest 
that he has made, of feminine portraits, real and 
fictitious. As usual, the captions for the various 
groups — " The ' Buds," " Daughters of Erin," 
"Wayside Flowers," "Good Company," "Saints," 
"The Blues," "Aunts and Grandmothers," "The 
Tyrants," and so on — give an individual quality 
to the small volume. The theme offers plenty of 
scope for variety, and there is no lack of that 
quality in Mr. Lucas's book, the selections in which 
are cuUed from all imaginable sources, both in prose 
and poetry. 

The Roman villas, " asleep in lap of legends old," 
have been chosen by Mrs. Elizabeth W. Champney 
for the latest volume in what might be called her 
romance-of-turrets-and-towers series. An earlier 
work of hers (" Romance of the Italian Villas ") 
dealt with famous villas outside of Rome. Now her 
" Romance of Roman Villas " (Putnam) presents, 
with a generous embellishment of song and story, 
the historic villas of the sacred city itself, of the 



Renaissance period. "Still unrivalled," she says 
in her introduction, " after the lapse of four cen- 
turies the villas of the great cardinals of the Renais- 
sance retain their supremacy over their Italian 
sisters, not, as once, by reason of their prodigal 
magnificence, but in the appealing charm of their 
picturesque decay." Her book is a highly orna- 
mented, profusely illustrated, handsomely printed 
volume of almost four hundred pages. 

Maeterlinck's poetic drama, " Pelleas and Mdl- 
isande," appears in a new edition (Crowell) with 
pictures in color and half-tone. These are repro- 
ductions of photographs representing scenes from 
the Debussy opera on the same theme, as it was first 
presented in New York with Miss Mary Garden as 
Mflisande. The translation is that of Mr. Erving 
Winslow, and an introduction by Mr. Montrose J. 
Moses puts the reader in touch with Maeterlinck's 
point of view and with this particular example of 
his work, and explains the relation between it and 
Claude Debussy's music-drama. Colored page bor- 
ders lend an additional decorative touch to the new 
edition. 

Readers of " Life," " Puck," and « Judge " will 
recall the clever nonsense verses of Mr. Thomas 
Ybarra, often accompanied by Mr. Hy. Mayer's 
humorous drawings to give an added zest to their 
absurdities. Some of the verses have now been 
collected in a small volume entitled " Davy Jones's 
Yarns, and Other Salted Songs" (Holt). Davy 
Jones is a delicious caricature of the Ancient 
Mariner, with many mad adventures to relate. The 
Swiss Admiral, the Mince Pu*ates, the Cuban Rev- 
olution Bug, and the Icecreamberg, figure conspic- 
uously in the five " Yarns." The " Salted Songs " 
are in similar vein, with a fantastic quality in their 
humor that is as unusual as it is delightful. The 
pictures, which are printed in two colors, are a dis- 
tinct attraction. 

A collection of brief essays on various things that 
make up the fascination of city life — beauty, human 
interest, fellowship, opportunities, holiday-making, 
the charms of a great past and a glorious future — 
written by Mr. Charles Mulford Robinson, appears 
from the press of Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. with 
the expressive title " The Call of the City." The 
book is beautifully printed on handmade, deckle- 
edged paper, with a photogravure frontispiece and 
a novel binding. Verses, selected with the same 
discrimination and originality that mark the style 
of the essays, appear as headings for the prose. 

"The Christmas Book" (Griffith & Rowland 
Press), by Miss Jane A. Stewart, is full of informa- 
tion about the origin of the universal holiday, and 
its characteristic sports and observances in this land 
and many others. There are also two Christmas 
exercises for children and some suggestions for 
home-made Christmas gifts. Illustrations, some of 
them in color, decorative headings, gay end papers 
and cover design, add a Christmas touch to the 
appearance of a book that is full of the Christmas 
spirit.

Notes. 



A revised edition of Miss Mary E. Lang's " Reading: 
A Manual for Teachers," is published by Messrs. D. C. 
Heath & Co. in their « Pedagogical Library." 

The Macmillan Co. publish a new translation, by Sir 
Clements Markham, of that famous picaresque novel, 
« The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes." Considerable edi- 
torial apparatus goes with the translation, and there are 
numerous illustrations. 

" The Origin and Early Development of the English 
Universities to the Close of the Thirteenth Century," 
by Mr. Earnest Vancourt Vaughn, is an important 
study in educational history, now published in the 
« Social Science Series " of the University of Missouri. 

" Poems of New England " is a reissue, in a single 
volume, of that section of Longfellow's " Poems of 
Places" which relate to the New England country. 
The compilation is now thirty years old, but it is well 
worth bringing before the attention of the new genera- 
tion. It is published, of course, by the Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

The Oliver Ditson Co. publish " Panseron's A B C of 
Music," as revised and extended by Mr. N. Clifford 
Page. This little book is a primer of vocalization by a 
musician who died half a century ago, and it has long 
been favorably known as an elementary text. Its first 
American edition dates from 1846, and has had a wide 
circulation. 

The first two volumes of a new " Readers' Library," 
published by the Fleming H. Revell Co., and edited by 
Messrs. W. J. and C. W. Dawson, are devoted to " The 
Great English Letter Writers," and give us a classified 
selection of examples from a wide range of authors. 
Considerable ingenuity has been exercised by the editors 
in bringing together letters from widely scattered 
sources under such suggestive and alluring categories 



420 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



as "Tribulations of Genius," "Pocket Philosophies," 
" By-gone Lovers," and " The Artist and His Art." 
Future volumes in this attractive series are to be devoted 
to essayists, historians, nature-lovers, "accusers," and 
other interesting groups. 

The "Dictionary of Quotations," compiled by Mr. 
Norman MacMunn, and published by Messrs. George 
W. Jacobs & Co., is a small volume of " extracts old and 
new from writers of all ages " — too small a volume, in 
fact, to be of much use in running down any given 
quotation, although it may benefit the writer in search 
of an appropriate text for some discourse. 

To reduce " Les Mis^rables " to text-book dimensions, 
allowing space for much editorial matter and a fairly 
complete vocabulary, means pruning of a rather merci- 
less sort, and we are not sure that we consider the task 
worth undertaking. However, it has been performed 
by Dr. Douglas L. BufEum, and the work is now issued 
for school use by Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. 

Three Grerman texts just published by Messrs. Henry 
Holt & Co. are the following: Moser's "Ultimo," 
edited by Professor Charles L. Crow ; Moser's " Der 
Bibliothekar," edited by Professor HoUon A. Farr; and 
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach's " Lotti, die Uhrmach- 
erin," edited by Professor George H Needier. The 
American Book Co. publish " Fritz auf Ferien," by the 
writer who calls herself " Hans Arnold," edited by Miss 
May Thomas. 

Almost the last piece of literary work from the pen 
of the late Professor Charles Eliot Norton, if not quite 
the last, was the writing of an Introductory Note for 
a new edition of the famous stories of Maria Edgeworth, 
whose work Mr. Norton admired, believing that the 
pictures of good breeding and pleasant manners of their 
time cannot fail to have a helpful influence on the 
young people of to-day. The volume is edited by that 
veteran purveyor of children's literature, Mr. Charles 
Welsh, and is published by Messrs. H. M. Caldwell & 
Co. with the title " Tales That Never Die." 

One of the most impressive peace documents ever 
prepared is Pastor Frenssen's story of " Peter Moor's 
Journey to Southwest Africa," which is a plain narra- 
tive, in the first person, of the experiences of a private 
soldier in the inglorious German campaign. It is the 
naked reality of warfare, not its blaze and glory, that 
confronts us in these pages, and no one can read them, 
we should think, without taking their lesson to heart. 
The translation, which is authorized, has been made 
with exceptional skill by Miss Margaret May Ward, 
and the little book is published by the Houghton 
Mifflin Co. 

Herr Axel Olrik is one of the most learned and in- 
dustrious modern students of the civilization and liter- 
ature of the old Scandinavian peoples, and already has 
a dozen or more works to his credit. His latest book 
is a condensed account of " Nordisk Aandsliv i Vikinge- 
tid og Tidlig Middelalder." Beginning with the age of 
the myth-makers, this monograph carries the story of 
the Norseman's spiritual life down to the early Christian 
era and to the time of the folk-songs. The work is 
beautifully prmted and illustrated. Herr Olrik has 
also issued a new edition of his selection of " Danske 
Folkeviser," with an extensive introduction and notes 
adequate to the purpose of the work, which is especially 
planned for the use of Danish schools. Both these pub- 
lications come to us from the Gyldendalske Boghandel, 
Copenhagen and Chicago.

Two Important Volumes 

Hawthorne and His Friends 

By F. B. SANBORN 

A comprehensive and sympathetic study of Nathaniel 
Hawthorne, and of the group of New England writers who 
did so much to mould American literature and bring it to 
the present high standard. Mr. Sanborn writes from an 
intimate knowledge of his subject, and from actual acquaint- 
ance with the circle of that period. A heretofore unpub- 
lished portrait of Una Hawthorne is included. 

Printed on handsome paper throughout. 
Torch boards extra. $3.00. 



Bronson Alcott and His Fruit- 
lands Experiment 

By F. B. SANBORN 

(Illustrated with seven portraits and views) 

A work of unusual interest, not only as a study in experi- 
mental socialism, but because it gives an especially clear 
insight into the remarkable experiences of that body of men 
and women who joined with Bronson Alcott in his singular, 
though unsuccessful, effort to establish an ideal community. 
Here again Mr. Sanborn knows his subject thoroughly. 

Printed and hound uniformly with the above. $3.00.

DAVID SWING 

POET-PREACHER 

By JOSEPH FORT NEWTON 

Interesting, not only as a worthy contribution to good litera- 
ture, but as a biography in the broadest sense — having for its 
theme the genius and character of one of the most eloquent 
preachers and essayists of the nineteenth century, one whose 
historic ministry in Music Hall, Chicago, is among the best 
traditions of the West. 

The book is written in a style that for beauty of diction is 
unusual ; and possesses the merit of authenticity, having been 
prepared after the most careful research, and with the assist- 
ance of the family of Professor Swing.

MILTON AS A SCHOOLMASTER 

John Milton was born in London in 1608, just three cen- 
turies ago, his birthday being December 9. One interesting 
and useful recognition of the ter-centenary, which will be 
valued especially by our teachers, is the publication by the 
directors of the Old South work in Boston, as one of their 
large series of Old South Leaflets, of Milton's famous little 
treatise on Education. A most remarkable treatise this was 
for its time.

POET LORE'S FICTION OFFER 



To increase the subscription list of POET LORE we have made arrange- 
ments with the publishers of the following books by which we are able to 
offer with each new subscription received before January i, 1909, a copy of 
any one of these, free of all cost to you. They are by well-known authors

THE COUNTRY BAND By Henry A. Shute 

Illustrated by Groesbeck 

i2mo Cloth Ornamental $1.00 

With "The Real Diary of a Real Boy" Mr. Shute 
established his reputation as a genuine humorist. 
"The Country Band," giving the experiences of 
the band in a typical country town, is even funnier. 
That 's the most anyone can say, and everybody 
who has read the book says it is a true statement. 




LILA SARI By William Lee Howard 

i2mo Cloth Ornamental $1.50 

A gripping romance of love, passion, and adventure. Audacious in its 
descriptive details, it is true to the laws of life and nature. Lila was queen 
of Paradise Island, in the Eastern seas. How she succumbed to the 
simplicity of a young naval officer is told in a bold manner in this interest- 
compelling story.

POET LORE'S FICTION OFFER 

(See Previous Page) 



MRS. JOHN VERNON By Julia De 

Frontispiece by Charles Dana Gibson 

i2mo Ornamental Cloth $1.50 

A wonderfully true story of social life in Boston. 
"Mrs. John Vernon" shows the narrow conven- 
tions of old Beacon Hill, the livelier spirit of the 
younger set, and the always underlying scandal. 
The cover and frontispiece by Charles Dana 
Gibson is notable as the only black and white he 
has done for several years, and is one of the most 
effective he has ever done. 



Wolf Addison 




EVERY MAN HIS CHANCE By Matilda Woods Stone 

i2mo Cloth Ornamental $1.50 

This is a story of the West, and truer to the section than hold-ups or the 
reckless gusto of the round-up. It tells of the rise and fall of a small town 
aspiring to be a large city. 



MENOTOMY: A Romance of 1776 By Margaret L. Sears 

i2mo Cloth Ornamental $1.50 

A thoroughly well-done story of the Revolution that possesses genuine 
merit and sustains the reader's interest to the last page. 



Any one of these books would be an ideal Christmas gift, while you can 
enjoy POET LORE the entire year. 

Subscription : $4.00 a year, in advance.

By HENRY VAN DYKE

the most important recent achievements in the poetic

for three of the most noble and powerful human impulses 
combine to give it volume, depth, and moving interest: 
love, patriotism, and religion. In idea and feeling it is 
unaflfectedly religious, in interest it is engrossingly dra- 
matic, in form and phrase it is deeply poetic. It is 
primarily a noble poetic play ; it is a play of varied and 
rapid movement, and it is also a drama of the intensest

so little literary work of serious spirit and high quality 
this play brings heart and hope to lovers of poetry."

phrasing . . . this is one of the many stimulating, joy- 
ously, unacademic ideas in the book." — Bookman.

OF THE MAGNIFICENT .u^^..,^^ 

OLD TESTAMENT 

As Illustrated by J. JAMES TISSOT 

The most beautiful, instructive, and valuable publishing achievement the world has seen. 
396 ILLUSTRATIONS— 117 IN COLORS 

Nothing approaching this work has ever been attempted before. In a series of nearly four hundred 
splendid pictures all the great and impressive scenes and incidents in the Bible story are depicted, true in 
color, costume, landscape, and all details to the life, the country, and the time. 



AN INSPIRATION IN RELIGION 



AN EDUCATION IN HISTORY 



A REVELATION IN ART 



The type is large, clear, new, and beautifid ; the paper is exquisite, thus enabling the printer to secure 
in colors an exact duplicate of the original paintings. The work is sumptuously bound in three-quarter 
leather, gold tops, two royal quarto sections of three hundred and fifty pages each. 

Tissot was something more than a great painter. He was an accomplished archaeologist and an 
indefatigable student of Bible history, and he had the God-given faculty of imparting to others by means 
of his pencil the same vision of persons, places, and incidents which he himself had acqHired.))y,t|^^duou^ 
studies and investigations of many years. !: K ■ -^V "' '" ' v'^' t> 

Tissot's Bible, then, is the Great Book in its most graphic and striking form. ' ' "' ^ , • ^'' 

To those who read the Bible habitually it is of the highest value, and to those who are seeking t6 
awaken a desire for Bible reading and study in others it is an invaluable auxiliary; Its strongest appeal 
is perhaps to parents and teachers, but we cannot imagine a home in which Tissot's wondrously illustrated 
Old Testament, if acquired now, will not be a treasured possession for generations to come.

thorne, and of the group of New England writers who did so 
much to mould American literature and bring it to the present 
high standard. Mr. Sanborn writes from an intimate knowl- 
edge of his subject, and from actual acquaintance with the 
circle of that period. A heretofore unpublished portrait of Una 
Hawthorne is included.

Bronson Alcott and His Fruit- 
lands Experiment 

By F. B. SANBORN 

(Illustrated with seven portraits and views.) 
A work of unusual interest, not only as a study in experi- 
mental socialism, but because it gives an especially clear insight 
into the remarkable experiences of that body of men and women 
who joined with Bronson Alcott in his singular, though unsuc- 
cessful, effort to establish an ideal community. Here again Mr. 
Sanborn knows his subject thoroughly. 
Printed and bound uniformly with the above. Prepaid $3.12, 



A Valuable Biography. Octavo, cloth. $2.00 (postpaid $2.18) . 

David Swing: Poet-Preacher 

By JOSEPH FORT NEWTON 

Interesting, not only as a worthy contribution to good litera- 
ture, but as a biography in the broadest sense — having for its 
theme the genius and. character of one of the most eloquent 
preachers and essayists of the nineteenth century, one whose 
historic ministry in Music Hall, Chicago, is among the best 
traditions of the West. 

The book is written in a style that for beauty of diction is 
unusual ; and possesses the merit of authenticity, having been 
prepared after the most careful research, and with the assist- 
ance of the family of Professor Swing.

THE COPYRIGHT QUESTION. 

Sometime during the coming year, the story 
of "The Celebrated Jumping Frog" will be 
removed from the protection of our law of copy- 
right and become the prey of the irresponsible 
publisher. Its aged but still sprightly author 
will have no legal means of preventing anyone 
from reproducing, in any form that may suggest 
itself, even a form inaccurate and mutilated, this 
pleasant tale of the guileful stranger who took 
a mean advantage of his unsuspecting fellow- 
countryman. The case is of no consequence in 
itself, but is typically important because it illus- 
trates a great wrong done by American law- 
makers to the profession of American authorship. 
The author of this particular bit of writing was 
among those who went to Washington two years 
ago to plead with Congress for a fairer system 
of copyright protection, and was welcomed as a 
humorist, but treated with indifference as a 
champion of the rights of literary property. 
Briefly stated, the grievance is simply that every 
American author who lives to the age of seventy 
or thereabouts must see his earlier writings pass 
out of his control, and his income from their 
sale become a vanishing quantity. The present 
decade has witnessed the expiration, during the 
author's lifetime, of copyright upon important 
works by Stedman, Aldrich, Norton, Dr. Mit- 
chell, Colonel Higginson, and Mr. Howells. In 
this respect we are far behind the rest of the 
civilized world, for most countries respect an 
author's rights in his own books as long as he 
lives and for a considerable term of years after 
his death. 

This is only one of many defects in our tangled 
copjT-ight legislation, but it is a particularly sali- 
ent one because of the personal injustice which 
it so clearly works. We consider the principle 
of perpetual copyright, although logically sound, 
to be of academic interest only ; for we believe 
that substantial justice wovdd be done by pro- 
tecting literary property during the author's life- 
time and for one or two generations beyond. To 
secure such protection should be the primary 
aim of the American Copyright League, which 
is about to renew its demands upon the national 
legislature. The League may have seemed mori- 
bund during the years since 1891, when its 



444 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



efforts brought about the imperfect although 
considerable triumph of International Copy- 
right, but its Council has been doing a good 
deal of quiet work all the time, and the activities 
which it now plans will not constitute a new 
departure. The membership of the League is 
now being reorganized, " so that the full force 
of American authorship may come to the sup- 
port of the Council, and that many authors 
who have achieved distinction in the last twenty 
years may have the honor and responsibility of 
contributing to the improvements in the pres- 
ent statute." \ 

The failure to protect authors in their liter- 
ary rights during their own lifetime and that of 
their immediate descendants is one of the two 
major evils of our copyright law as it now exists. 
The other is the " manufacturing clause " in the 
act granting copyright protection to foreign 
authors. To say that an Englishman shall have 
no rights under our law to the product of his 
brain until that product shall be put into mar- 
ketable form by American labor, is precisely 
like saying that the same Englishman, landing 
in New York, shall have no right to personal 
protection against violence until he has pur- 
chased American-made garments and clothed 
himself therein. Looked at in this light, the 
sheer economic waste of the duplicate type- 
setting becomes a less important aspect of the 
evil than the downright wrong done the indi- 
vidual by this piratical demand. We are well 
aware that without the acceptance of this obnox- 
ious requirement the Act of 1891 would have 
failed of its passage, and as a temporizing ex- 
pedient, resorted to for the sake of securing an 
instalment of equity, we were willing to justify 
it. But every friend of fair dealing is bound to 
lift up his voice, in and out of season, to protest 
against a supine acceptance of this condition as 
a part of any final settlement. It is a compro- 
mise essentially revolting to the sense of inter- 
national justice. 

We could wish that the agitation for copy- 
right reform might be narrowed down to the 
discussion of the above two evils only, until they 
were effectively remedied ; but this wish would 
be futile. We may reasonably hope for an 
extension of the term of copyright, but there is 
little immediate likelihood of our giving more 
than the present half-measure of justice to the 
foreign author. The unholy alliance of special 
interests which has made " protection " a syno- 
nym for " oppression " is too firmly in control 
of the law-making machinery to allow us to 
hope that the grip of its typographical tentacle 



will be loosened in the near future. There 
seems to be nothing for it but to keep on tem- 
porizing, and work for improvements in small 
matters, while the large question of principle is 
left for another generation to settle. But we 
repeat that this large question should never be 
lost sight of, and that its equitable settlement 
should be the underlying aim of all who honestly 
work for a more enlightened law in copyright 
affairs. 

Among the reforms just now thought prac- 
ticable by the League are an extension of the 
term of copyright, the abolition of the manu- 
facturing clause in its application to foreign 
languages 07ily, the establishment of penalties 
for violations of copyright and stageright, the 
protection of copyrights assigned to corporations, 
the simplification of certain details of the law 
as now existing, the abolition of the disfiguring 
copyright notice on works of art, and the recog- 
nition of the rights of composers in mechanical 
reproductions of their music. The whole ques- 
tion of copyright legislation is exceedingly com- 
plicated, and is becoming more so all the time. 
The problem last named in the above list has 
been injected into the discussion very recently, 
and has made a great deal of trouble. It was 
the opposition of the mechanical music pirates 
that mdlified the efforts of the League two years 
ago, when a determined attempt was made to 
induce Congress to amend and rationalize our 
law of copyright. We presume that the com- 
poser ought to be protected against the manufac- 
ture of mechanical devices for the reproduction 
of his music, but we wish that his grievance, so 
comparatively new, might be separated from the 
long-standing grievance of the authors' guild, 
and dealt with on its own accoimt. That it may 
not be thus distinguished means simply that a 
new " vested interest " joins hands with the old 
ones in opposition to the rights of intellectual 
workers, and makes their prospects seem darker 
than ever before. 

Probably some of the reforms now urged by 
the League will be effected by its activity. 
We may perhaps get, instead of a few patches 
here and there, a general revision and codifica- 
tion of the entire body of law relating to intel- 
lectual property. This is an aim worth working 
for, even if the law should remain bad in some 
of its essential features. As matters no«v stand, 
only an expert (and he not always) can tell 
what the law is upon many points. It may be a 
necessary preliminary to the securing of a wise 
and just law that we should first be enabled to 
get a clear view of the law that we actually

have. At all events, it is clear that much work 
remains to be done, and it is work in which 
every American author should take an interest, 
which means, among other things, contributing 
both money and personal effort to the campaign 
now about to be inaugurated anew. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



Some idiosyncrasies of Sardou have been 
recalled by his friends since his death. That he 
had an eagerly acquisitive and (in a good sense) 
inquisitive mind, need not surprise us. " You should 
have watched him turning the leaves of a book," 
says one who knew him, " or scrutinizing a picture. 
Thoughts, ideas, images he devoured. He trans- 
formed them and made them his own." In his 
youth, when, poor and often in need of food, he 
roamed about Paris seeking employment, it seemed 
as if nothing unusual could happen without his being 
on the spot to see it ; and he was also an indefatigable 
questioner of those who had been eye-witnesses of 
memorable events beyond his reach. " I have heard 
him tell of his meeting with Mme. de Metternich," 
writes another friend. " As soon as he knew of her 
presence in the house where he was a guest, he 
hastened to interrogate her. He asked for her recol- 
lections of Metternich, of the Vienna treaty, of 
' I'Aiglon *; then he asked whether Metternich was 
wont to talk much about the emperor, and burned 
to find out what he had said of him. That is how 
he came by the anecdotes he used to relate with 
such spirit." Still another friend, visiting the great 
dramatist in his illness, found him distressed at his 
inability to work. •■' All the same," he cried abruptly, 
*' I have strength enough to reply to the wretch who 
has been guilty, in an article on Beaumarchais, of 
saying that when the author of ' Figaro ' came to 
Paris he lived in the third house on the left of the 
boulevard, whereas God knows it was the first house 
on the right ! " And then he indulged in a fine burst 
of wrath against the inaccurate historian. He appears 
to have been almost as passionately alive as the famous 
actress for whom he conceived some of his greatest 

characters. 

• • • 

Types of pedantry that afford no little entertain- 
ment in the amusement or the amused exasperation 
that they excite have been created in considerable 
number by the great novelists and playwrights. 
Scott's Antiquary and Dominie Sampson, Shake- 
speare's Holofernes and George Eliot's Mr. Casau- 
bon, are a few of the pedants that live and long will 
live in our literature. Worthy to be ranked with 
these — in fact, almost a twin brother to Mr. 
Casaubon — is Lucas Malet's Dr. Casteen, the exi- 
gent and patience-trying father of the heroine in " A 
Counsel of Perfection." A recent reading of the 
book impresses one with the admirable skill displayed 



in the portrayal of this purblind, self-absorbed, and 
altogether unamiable scholar. " Lucas Malet," as 
perhaps not all readers may remember, is the pen- 
name of Mrs. St. Leger Harrison, youngest daughter 
of Charles Kingsley. In the Rev. Dr. Casteen, 
learned author of "The Heretical Defections from 
the Early Church," the world of letters gained a fit 
companion to Dorothea Brooke's mummified hus- 
band, the sour-visaged recluse whose interests were 
wholly centred in his projected but never completed 
" Key to All Mythologies." Compare the unrespon- 
sive hardness of the two men. In the midst of a 
little discussion with Dorothea in which Mr. Casau- 
bon's position threatened to become untenable, he 
broke off with the dry suggestion, " We will, if you 
please, say no more on this subject, Dorothea. I 
have neither leisure nor energy for this kind of 
debate." No wonder the young wife exclaimed to 
herself in despair : '' What have I done — what am 
I — that he should treat me so ? He never knows 
what is in my mind — he never cares. What is the 
use of anything I do ? " Much in the same manner, 
Lydia Casteen finds herself continually misunder- 
stood and put in the wrong by her father despite all 
her uncomplaining devotion to him and his great 
book. Dr. Casteen checks a debate with Lydia in 
which he is not distinguishing himself for openness 
and liberality, by saying: "I must entreat you to 
exercise a little more self-control; pray spare me 
any more of these protests — this emotion — this 
instability of thought and intention. I am really 
unequal to further discussion. ... It behooves me 
to husband carefully the remnants both of my mental 
and bodily strength." No wonder Lydia's "heart 
was sore for a little affection, her thoughts bitter, 
her sense of injury keen. Her father, as usual, had 
contrived to put her in the wrong." For concen- 
trated selfishness under a cloak of pedantic devotion 
to a magnum opus, these two desiccated embodi- 
ments of dead learning are a pair hard to equal. 
That the creator of Dr. Casteen has studied appre- 
ciatively the valetudinarian Mr. Casaubon is evident, 
but need not redound to her discredit. She is a 
writer of distinctly original quality. 

Dead authors who ought not to be buried 
in oblivion are repeatedly coming to the notice of the 
literary rambler. For example, there is Mortimer 
Collins, author of " Sweet Anne Page," a story of 
acknowledged charm, and of " The Inn of Strange 
Meetings," a volume of clever verse ; and it was his 
daughter, Miss Mabel Collins (let it not be inferred 
that she too is dead), who wrote the novel with the 
very taking title, "The Prettiest Woman in Warsaw." 
A chance newspaper paragraph on the father gives 
a most prepossessing picture of the man, and makes 
one wish for a shelff ul of his books ( if he wrote so 
many) and a week's vacation in which to read them. 
" His work," says one who knew him, " reflected in 
a remarkable degree his wonderful personality.

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Although it is over thirty years ago, I can still recall 
the magnificent frame and leonine head of Mortimer 
Collins when, on one bright summer day, he sailed 
into the office of his publisher, Mr. Henry S. King, 
on the historic spot from whence the CornhUl 
Magazine was first issued under Thackeray's editor- 
ship, and I can again hear in fancy the sound of his 
deep, melodious voice, as I first heard it then. . . . 
He was every inch a man, a self-proclaimed artist 
and poet, and his books and his looks revealed 
another side of his character also. . . . The pleas- 
ure of dining at his table, garnished as it was with 
his own wonderful wit, was a never-to-be-forgotten 
experience. He was, as may be judged from the 
foregoing, the most unconventional of men in every 
respect ; but he was not, like many a poet and 
scholar, 'gey uncomfortable to live wi'.' On the 
contrary, he made a poem out of life and fun out of 
everything. He was as big-hearted and boyish, 
genial, guileless and lovable as a great Newfound- 
land dog. The celebrated journalist, George 
Augustus Sala, characterized him as 'a ripe 
scholar and skilled mathematician, an antiquary, a 
botanist, a most melodious and facile versifier, a 
humourist and a wit.' " We are wont to complain of 
a dearth of great writers ; but, once having con- 
sented to seek enjoyment in authors not perched on 
the very apex of the pinnacle of greatness, how 
many of them there are with whom even a well-read 
person may find himself astonishingly unfamiliar. 
• • • 

The book-lover and the tbee-lovek may 
exist in one and the same person, and yet the book- 
loypr is, in a certain sense, and commonly without 
knowing it, a tree-destroyer, and so an enemy to 
trees. To provide wood-pulp for the paper that goes 
into the great bulk of our books and magazines and 
other periodicals and newspapers, there are annually 
denuded one thousand eight hundred and thirty 
square miles of woodland. (This interesting fact 
was brought to public notice at the recent investiga- 
tion of the so-called paper trust, when a representa- 
tive of newspaper interests argued convincingly for 
unprotected paper-manufacture.) How many square 
miles are left bare each year by the cutters of timber 
for building purposes, we cannot say ; and how many 
are left in blackened ruin by forest fires, we shudder 
to imagine. But the buyer of books, or of printed 
matter in almost any form, is adding his infinitesimal 
fraction to the demand for more wood-pulp ; he is 
unconsciously calling to the woodman not to spare 
that tree ; and he is hastening, however innocently, 
the time when treeless, freshet-washed wastes, de- 
nuded of fertile soil and incapable of retaining the 
refreshing rains, shall give unpleasant premonition 
of the ultimate cessation of vital activity on this earth 
of ours. Not that this melancholy end is near enough 
to keep us awake nights, — it may be millions or 
even billions of years in the future, for aught we 
know. But it is well for the reader to be reminded 



in due season that when this ruthless denudation of 
old mother earth shall have been accomplished, he, 
little though he may now be dreaming of any such 
thing, will have been & particeps criminis.

The tender grace of a day that is dead 
haunts the house in Plymouth Grove, Manchester, 
England, where "Cranford" and "Mary Barton" 
and the other delightful stories of Mrs. Gaskell's 
were written, a house that for nearly half a century 
has remained a centre of social warmth, of refining 
influence, of a certain old-fashioned human charm 
and hospitality. The recent death, in that house, of 
Miss Julia Gaskell, the youngest daughter of the 
novelist, and herself one of the best known person- 
ages in the social life and the philanthropic under- 
takings of Manchester, carries us back once more to 
that vanished Victorian age in whose prime her 
childhood was passed. She had, says one who knew 
her, the eager sympathy and communicative quick- 
ness that make good talk possible ; she was ardently 
interested in letters, painting, the theatre, and 
music, and her convictions and point of view were 
always unmistakable and characteristic. With an 
elder sister, also unmarried, she had continued to 
live in the house where her mother and her father, 
the Rev. William Gaskell, of Cross-Street Chapel, 
had years before settled in what was then a rural 
suburb of the manufacturing city, but is now a 
crowded urban quarter in which almost the only 
breathing space is a recreation park recently pre- 
sented to the city by the Misses Gaskell. Wealth 
and fashion have moved to the more attractive 
green spaces outside, but the Gaskell house remains 
a now somewhat melancholy reminder of the good 
old days. Yet a little while, and it too will have 
vanished. ... 

Recognition by one's fellow-craftsmen is 
always a sweet reward for toil. A curious instance 
of such recognition on the part of a noted playwright 
recently deceased may be worth relating, or recall- 
ing, at this time. In that unusually interesting and 
perhaps too little known life of Robert Buchanan 
which his sister-in-law. Miss Harriett Jay, wrote 
immediately after his untimely death, occurs the 
following pleasant incident in connection with 
Buchanan's dramatization of the Cupid and Psyche 
legend. " The Bride of Love " was the name he 
gave to his poetical and imaginative rendering of 
the ancient myth. " There is no modern instance, 
I think," writes Miss Jay, " of a poetical play atti-act- 
ing audiences on its own merits apart from the arts 
of the showman and the tricks of the scene-painter. 
This experiment cost him some thousands of pounds, 
nor was he much consoled, I fancy, by the almost 
daily receipt of letters from unknown admirers con- 
gratulating him on the work. One of these letters 
was so remarkable in the tone of its compliments as 
to be almost unique. The writer said that he had

long ceased to find in the theatre the enjoyment 
and the interest of his early years ; the glamour 
had all passed away, as he thought, forever ; but in 
witnessing the ' Bride of Love,' he said, all the 
charm and all the glamour had returned, and he felt 
again the delight and enthusiasm of his boyhood. 
The signature to this letter was that of the distin- 
guished American dramatist, Bronson Howard."

The Boston Public Library's Miltoniana, 
rich in number and variety, were temporarily aug- 
mented to form an exhibition in memory of the great 
poet's birth three hundred years ago. On the ninth 
of this month (Milton's birthday) there was opened 
to the public such a display of Milton books and 
manuscripts and portraits as had never before been 
gathered together in this country. To the treasures 
of this sort already owned by the library, valuable 
additions were made in loans from Mrs. J. Mont- 
gomery Sears's collection and from the large stock 
of literary rarities accumulated in London by that 
genius of the book-trade, Mr. Bernard Quaritch. 
Perhaps the most interesting item in the exhibition 
was an autograph loaned by him in the form of an 
old parchment, about two feet long by eighteen inches 
wide, dated 1623 and bearing the boy Milton's sig- 
nature at the bottom. It was a post-nuptial settle- 
ment between the poet's sister Anne and Edward 
Phillips. Milton's extant signatures are so rare as 
to give great value to this document. In connection 
with all this tercentenary celebration the natural 
query arises, Will it prompt one person out of half 
a million to open his " Paradise Lost " and read it 
through from cover to cover, or even one book of it ? 
Somehow the poem does not irresistibly appeal to 
twentieth-century cravings. One would like to know 
what is the present demand for it at public libraries 
and book-shops. , , 

A TRANSLATOR OF UNEXAMPLED POPULARITY 

has been taken from us, to the grief of thousands 
of readers — especially young readers — by the 
recent death of Mrs. A. L. Wister at the home of her 
brother, Dr. Horace Howard Furness, in Philadel- 
phia. To find another American writer who has 
made for herself such a place in girls' affections, one 
would have to go back to Louisa Alcott. Mrs. Wister's 
books, translations though they were, seemed to 
breathe her own personality ; they all had her charac- 
teristics. To be translated by Mrs. Wister must have 
been felt, by the German story-tellers whom she thus 
distinguished, to be a high honor. There was a sin- 
gular prophecy in the dedication to her last published 
work, " The Lonely House," by Adolph Streckfuss. 
She wrote : " I take pleasure in inscribing this 
translation — the last I shall ever complete — to 
the children and grandchildren of those who so 
kindly welcomed the first, published a lifetime ago." 
By generations of children yet to come her versions 
of wholesome and homely German romances are 
likely to be read with all the delight that hailed their 
first appearance. 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 



THE " DISSIDENCE OF DISSENT " AMONG 

ESPERANTISTS. 

(To the Editor of The Dial.) 

The letter of a correspondent in your last issue, 
advocating " Ido " in place of the universal language 
Esperanto, has caused some amusement among Esper- 
antist circles in the East. Mr. McPike is neither con- 
vincing nor consistent. " Simplified Esperanto " (called 
" Ido ") is no more practical than simplified English, 
and the ultimate result of the two will be the same. It 
is not generally known that the author of " Ido " is 
M. de Beaufront, and that what seems to be his chief 
reason for publishing this rival to the language which 
he formerly endorsed is his dissatisfaction with the 
subordinate position that up to this time he has been 
content to take. Even the title of his language is an 
Esperanto word, meaning a descendant ! 

This defection has caused some indignation among 
Esperantists, who have been working for twenty-two 
years, spreading the language all over the world and 
meeting with remarkable success; and all who have used 
it — such men as Count Tolstoy, Sir WiUiam Ramsay, 
Professor Ostwald, and Mr. George Harvey, president 
of the national Esperanto association — unite in declar- 
ing it entirely satisfactory for representing every shade 
of meaning of which the human speech is capable. If 
the new generation, they protest, is to be informed 
that changes are proposed in this perfectly practical 
language by a band of childish malcontents, the people 
will naturally hesitate before taking up the study, not 
only of Esperanto but of any universal tongue whatever, 
arguing that if " reforms " are once started (where they 
are unnecessary) there would be little use in giving time 
to acquiring a language the fundamentals of which are 
likely never to remain constant. 

The author of " Ido " is nothing less than a plagiarfst, 
for it is evident that he has appropriated nearly all the 
advantages of Esperanto and has added to them ideas 
of his own which improve Esperanto little. These 
ideas, if published broadcast with the mantle of a 
former authority on and adherent of the tongue which 
he now seeks to supersede, may work havoc with the 
cause of any universal tongue. 

But Esperantists, knowing the history of " Ido " and 
its inventor, do not apprehend any serious rivalry.

THE WORD "METICULOUS." 
(To the Editor of The Dial.) 
In your issue of December 1, in a paragraph under 
the heading " Casual Comment," you are rather severe 
on the English reviewer of " Diana Mallory " for using 
the word " meticulous " in the place of over-careful. In 
my Century Dictionary the word has just this meaning. 
" We are none of us infallible — not even the yoimgest." 

W. L. D. 

[No, not even the youngest dictionary. We 
should have to reprint the entire paragraph from 
our last issue (p. 396) to make clear our objection 
to the use of the word made by the English critic.

The Atjthokized Life of Whisti.ek.* 



Whistler's selection of Mr. and Mrs. Pennell 
as his biographers was an exceptionally happy 
one. Whatever may be thought of their esti- 
mate of him as " the greatest artist of his time " 
and one of the commanding figures in the art of 
all time, there can be no question that Mrs. 
Pennell, upon whom the literary workmanship of 
"The Life of James McNeill Whistler" devolved, 
has written a most enchanting book. This much 
must be admitted even by the Philistines who 
neither know nor care anything about art. 

The charm with which the relation has been 
invested is indeed compelling. The abundant 
material, brought forth by painstaking effort, has 
been arranged with consummate skill. Much 
was learned from the lips of the master himself. 
This has been supplemented by the recollections 
of his friends and of many people who in one 
way or another had been brought into close 
contact with him. The book is a conscientious 
endeavor to put before the reader Whistler as 
he really was — as he appeared to those privi- 
leged to know him intimately. So to tell the 
tale that his unique personality would appear 
in its proper light, that his idiosyncrasies would 
not obscure the vision of the inner man and 
rob the portrait of verisimilitude, was not an 
easy task. Its successful accomplishment is 
largely due to the straightforward simplicity 
and directness of the narration. The numerous 
anecdotes with which the pages are enlivened are 
so introduced that each one contributes some- 
thing to our understanding of the man. No 
attempt has been made to gloze over his faults. 
Frankly set forth, they are left to make what im- 
pression they may ; and if they seem not greatly 
in evidence, it is because such things are, after 
all, always relative, and in Whistler's case they 
were far outweighed by his finer qualities. 

The world is dominated by conventional ideas 
from the bondage of which few have the pre- 
science or the courage to break away. To 
strive long and suffer much in the effort to im- 
press new truths upon the inert mass of their 
unthinking fellows has been the usual experi- 
ence of the bearers of important messages that 
did not square with prevailing notions. 

It was Whistler's lot to be the bearer of a 
message for which the world is not yet ready — 

♦The Life of James McNeill Whistler. By E. R. and 
J. Pennell. In two volumes. Illustrated. Philadelphia: J. B. 
J ippincott Co. 



an intellectual concept easier of apprehension 
than comprehension by the mass of mankind, 
and likely therefore to be fought over by oppos- 
ing factions for many generations to come. The 
concept is not a new one, nor was Whistler its 
first prophet. It is merely that subject as such 
and art as such are separate, although not sep- 
arable, things ; that the appeal of art is solely 
to the aesthetic sense, and that, as a necessary 
corollary, the artist has no mission except to 
create beauty. This concept Whistler presented 
in concrete form. His pictures were its visual 
exponents. He called them " arrangements " 
in certain colors, and the conventional world 
about him knew not what to think of them or 
of him. His own words in this connection are 
pertinent : 

" I know that many good people think my nomen- 
clature funny and myself ' eccentric' Yes, ' eccen- 
tric ' is the adjective they find for me. The vast 
majority of English folk cannot and will not consider a 
picture as a picture, apart from any story which it may 
be supposed to tell. ... As music is the poetry of sound, 
so is painting the poetry of sight, and the subject-matter 
has nothing to do with harmony of sound or of colour." 

Readers of the book will enjoy another famous 
utterance, too long to be quoted here, wherein, in 
terms of witty and withering sarcasm. Whistler 
paid his compliments to " the British subject." 
The critics and the people were alike bewildered. 
"He had," says Mrs. Pennell, " robbed them of 
their only pleasure in art." Accordingly they 
scoffed at what they could not understand. They 
laughed at the paintings, and they laughed at the 
painter, refusing to take seriously on.e of the most 
serious of men. 

As unfolded in the pages of this delectable 
biography, the story of the long years of patient 
effort before recognition came is an impressive 
human document. With delicate tact and sym- 
pathy Mrs. PenneU depicts the life-struggle of 
the great man, high-strung, abnormally sensitive, 
hurt to the quick by lack of appreciation and 
persistent misunderstanding, yet in the face of 
ridicule, open antagonism, and even personal 
affront, holding tenaciously to his artistic creed, 
and waiting until past middle-age for the meed 
of praise he had earned early in his career. 

Whistler's militant spirit did not permit him 
to take the buffeting meekly. Nature had 
endowed him with exuberant vitality, extra- 
ordinary social talent and personal magnetism, 
and wit of the most brilliant and pungent quality. 
These were alike his saving graces, the defiant 
masque behind which he hid his real self from 
a cruel and unfeeling world, and also, it can 
scarcely be doubted, contributory causes that did

much to defer merited honors. For the pleasure 
of impaling real or fancied enemies upon the 
shafts he forged for their undoing, he paid a 
heavy price. If he wished to be taken seriously 
he shoidd not have made the world laugh. Yet 
we could ill spare even one of these witticisms — 
so nicely calculated, exquisitely polished, irre- 
sistibly amusing, and withal so deadly. One 
might almost fancy the victims expiring in hys- 
terics between their laughter and their tears. 
His quick resentment was, alas, often aroused 
by affronts that were not intended as such, and 
it was incomprehensible to the offenders whose 
feelings would not have been hurt had the rela- 
tive positions been reversed. The misunder- 
standing was sometimes mutual. In being mis- 
understood he took whimsical and contemptuous 
delight, born of conscious superiority to a public 
incapable of perceiving truth which to him was 
self-evident. What he could not forgive was 
pretense to knowledge of art. That irritated 
and provoked him ; it was a crime against art, 
and he felt impelled to take up cudgels in her 
defense. 

There were other sides to Whistler's character, 
as Mrs. Pennell shows. Not less salient traits 
were unfailing kindness and tender affection for 
his friends, of whom he had many throughout 
the entire course of his life. Despite the insist- 
ent egoism that made him always a law unto 
himself, few men have ever inspired more ardent 
friendship. The veneration in which he is held 
by his biographers is indeed almost overpowering, 
and might raise doubts as to the veracity of the 
portrait were not adoring witnesses so many. 
Those who knew him well are all alike worship- 
pers at the shrine ; and it is impossible that their 
love could have been undeserved. Even his ser- 
vants, Mrs. Pennell tells us, were always devoted 
to him, and endured without complaint the incon- 
veniences caused by his unconventional ways and 
habitual unpimctuality. 

In a very special sense. Whistler's art was 
his life. It was "the begiiming and end of 
his every thought and ambition." To separate 
Whistler the man from Whistler the artist 
woidd be impossible. Quite properly, there- 
fore, this biography is full of details about his 
methods of working, his paintings and drawings, 
his etchings and lithographs, when they were 
executed and where they were exhibited. The 
transcendent quality of his etchings was admitted 
from the very first ; but, although his greatness 
as an artist has long been conceded, there is stiU 
rather halting recognition of the artistic worth 
of his paintings. Yet, to those who have passed 



beyond the childhood stage of art-appreciation, 
they make no uncertain appeal, and the best of 
them belong in the category of the world's 
masterpieces. As a colorist he has had few 
superiors. Upon color and composition he 
lavished all his knowledge and skill. To make 
the color " grow out of the gray " of the back- 
gi'ound, as he expressed it, was his constant 
effort. This could be accomplished to his satis- 
faction only by painting his pictures at a single 
sitting. Rather than retouch them he preferred 
to scrape out what had been done and begin 
over again. In this way countless sittings were 
required for his portraits. The method involved 
sacrifices, — among them, minute accuracy of 
draughtsmanship. Out of this grew the charge 
that he could not draw. Hands and feet in 
particular gave him difficulty, as to delineate 
them with precision would have taken more 
time than was available. He could of course 
draw, and draw divinely ; but the truth is that 
drawing was not his strongest point, and that 
rhythm of line sometimes gave him infinite 
trouble, as he admitted to his friend Fantin- 
Latour in a letter in which he " deplored the 
mistakes of his early training." 

All human accomplishment is circumscribed 
by the limitation that attainment in any direc- 
tion is at the expense of shortcoming in some 
other. No criticism is fair that does not take 
this into consideration. Whistler's art shoidd 
be judged in the light of what he aimed to do. 
It was not the only thing worth doing, though 
to him it may have seemed to be ; but the lesson 
he taught was one of great importance, and in 
teaching it he produced many works of power 
and beauty for which the world has reason to be 
profoundly grateful. No artist ever strove more 
earnestly to realize his ideal. From the Jap- 
anese he had learned that in the finest compo- 
sitions there can be nothing superfluous, and 
that every shape, every line, every hue and tone 
must be right in relation to every other and to 
the combined effect of all. Therefore, whatever 
entered into his pictures was subjected to the 
fire of the most critical taste. He was " always 
striving for the little more that meant perfec- 
tion," nor, within the limits he set for himself, 
did he fail to achieve it. 

Where art was concerned. Whistler could 
endure no trifling. Like all men of genius, he 
had infinite capacity for taking pains. His 
letters were as carefully constructed as his 
pictures, and it is impossible not to regret that 
his biographers were restrained from printing 
any of them. We could, however, better afford

to lose these than the very interesting account 
of the Aeademie Carmen contributed by Mrs. 
Clifford Adams, or Mr. Sauter's description of 
his visit to Haarlem with Whistler in 1902 and 
the rapturous exclamations of delight with which 
he revelled in the handiwork of Franz Hals : 
"Look at it — just look — look at the beautiful 
colour — the flesh — look at the white — that 
black — look how those ribbons are put in ! " 
" There," says Mr. Sauter, " was the real 
Whistler — the man, the artist, the painter, — 
there was no ' why drag in Velasquez' spirit — 
but the spirit of a youth, full of ardour, full of 
plans, on the threshold of his work, oblivious of 
the achievements of a lifetime." 

The outward appearance of Mr. and Mrs. 
Pennell's fine volumes is in keeping with their con- 
tents. The form is that of the large-paper copies 
of " The Gentle Art of Making Enemies," which 
Whistler himself designed ; and the typography 
is in accord with the most exacting taste. A 
few inaccuracies have crept in, some of them 
plainly attributable to the haste with which the 
proof-reading had to be done to get the book out 
before the holidays. Whistler's funeral was not 
on July 23, as stated, but on Wednesday, 
July 22. By a slip of the pen, the date of his 
father's death, which occurred on April 7, 1849, 
is given as August 9, 1849, although upon the 
next page that is named as the date when the 
widow and her two sons landed in New York. 
Another error is the designation of Howard 
Mansfield's catalogue of Whistler's etchings 
and dry-points, shortly to be issued by the 
Caxton Club of Chicago, as " the great Grolier 
Club catalogue." 

The numerous illustrations constitute a fea- 
ture of great interest. Many of them are in 
photogravure, and as reproductions they give 
all that could be asked for save color. Taken 
together, they afford a more extended glimpse 
of the range and character of Whistler's art 
than has hitherto been available.

the Christian consolation. Few lovers of the 
poem doubt its genuine elegiac character. The 
father's sorrow is too sore for allegory. 

" Alas ! I lost my pearl of old ! 
I pine with heart-pain unforgot." 

" I mourned my pearl, dear beyond cost, 
And strange fears with my fancy fought; 
My will in wretchedness was lost. 
And yet Christ comforted my thought." 

There falls upon the mourner, praying at the 
flower-grown grave, a sleep in which he beholds,

in 1864; and Mr. Israel Gollancz in 1891 ex- 
tended the gift to us all, printing the text on 
the left-hand pages, with a line for line and 
stanza for stanza rendering on the right. This 
translation, though making no attempt at 
rhyme, has the look of stanzas and a certain 
rhythmic movement, together with a force and 
fineness of phrasing that contribute to a general 
poetic effect. The sixth stanza, for instance, is 
thus rendered : 

" My spirit thence sped forth into space, 

my body lay there entranced on that mound, 

my soul, by grace of God, had fared 

in quest of adventure, where marvels be. 

I knew not where that region was ; 

I was borne, iwis, where the cliffs rose sheer; 

toward a forest I set my face, 

where rocks so radiant were to see, 

that none can trow how rich was the light 
the gleaming glory that glinted therefrom, 
for never a web by mortal spun 
was half so wondrous fair." 

Some readers may prefer to this the literal 
prose translation (privately printed at Prince- 
ton in 1907) of Dr. Charles G. Osgood, who 
in the year preceding had brought out in the 
I "Belles-Letters Series" a new edition of the text.

The corresponding passage in Dr. Osgood's ver- 
sion reads more simply. 

" Thence sprang my soul aloft while my body lay at 
the grave-momid in dreams. For in God's grace my 
soul set forth on a strange journey to behold marvels. 
I knew not where in the world it was ; I only saw that 
I was brought into a place where great cliffs stood 
cleaving together. Toward a forest I took my way, 
where were seen rocks of richest hue. The light — the 
gleaming glory that flashed from them might no man 
beUeve ; no fabric woven by men was ever half so bright 
and rare." 

More readers, perhaps, would respond to Dr. 
S. Weir Mitchell's version (Century Company, 
1906 ; reprinted in Mosher's "Bibelot' series, 
July, 1908), which renders a poem by a poem, 
though in different stanzaic form. 

" Thence sped my spirit far through space, 
My body tranced upon the groimd. 
My soul's quick ghost by God's sure grace 
Adventuring where be marvels found. 
I wist not where on earth that place 
With cloven cliffs, so high and sheer. 
But toward a wood I set my face. 
Borne whither radiant rocks appear. 
Their light more golden than the sun, 
A gleaming glory glinted thence : 
Was never web of mortals spun 
So wondrous fair to mortal sense." 

Yet Dr. Mitchell's rendering, altogether sympa- 
thetic and poetic, falls in two points short of the 
ideal translation. It does not reproduce the 
complicated but most effective metrical scheme 
of the original, and it gives less than half of 
the elegy, — forty-six stanzas out of the one 
hundred and one. 

The technical structure of " The Pearl " 
might well be the despair of translators, com- 
bining as it does the old alliteration with an 
elaborate system of rhyme. Each stanza con- 
sists of twelve verses, carried on three rhymes, 
one occuring six times, one four and one two. 
The closing verse of each stanza constitutes a 
refrain repeated, with slight variations, for a 
group of five stanzas that are further linked 
together by echoing in the first line of each new 
stanza the chief word in the last line of its 
predecessor. By way of illustration, here are 
stanzas 82 and 83 in the rendering of Miss 
Marian Mead (Mosher's " Old World Series " 
1908). To the father, longing for a sight of 
the City of God, the daughter gives direction. 

" ' Wilt thou see the spot where it doth hide, 
Bend thy steps up toward the river's head. 
And across from thee upon this side, 
I will follow, till thou to a hill hast led.' 
Then there woidd I no longer bide ; 
By fair-leav'd boughs I softly fled, 
Till a hill before me I espied. 
And beheld the city, as up 1 sped. 



Beyond the stream, far from me, that stead, 
That brighter than sun, with clear beams shone ; 
In Apocalypse its fashion is read, 
As describeth it the Apostle John. 

" As John the apostle saw the sight. 
Saw I that city high renown'd, 
Jerusalem the New, full royally dight, 
As it new alighted from heaven was found. 
Of pure gold all that burgh was built, 
Burnish'd, it gleam'd like glass around, 
With precious gems beneath it pightj 
The base with courses twelve was crown'd, 
Foundations twelve, full richly bound. 
And a special stone each tier thereon ; 
As well that city's praise doth soimd. 
In Apocalypse, the Apostle John." 

The above passage is fairly representative of 
Miss Mead's version throughout, exemplifying 
its general accuracy and literary skill and also 
its occasional lapses in rhyme (sight, dight, built, 
pight) and more frequent roughening of the 
music, with a lack of ease, here and there, in 
phrase and sentence-turn. Yet as a whole Miss 
Mead's version is a marked advance upon Mr. 
Coulton's (Nutt, London, 1907), the first to 
attempt the difficult metrical scheme. Mr. 
Coulton's rendering of these same stanzas is as 
follows : 

" ' If I that spot shall now un-hide. 

Bend upward to this streamlet's head. 
And I against thee on this side. 
Until thou see a broad hill spread.' 
Then would I no longer bide. 
But stole through many a flowery mead; 
Till, from a hill that 1 espied, 
I saw its dazzling radiance shed. 
Beyond the swirling river-bed 
It shone more radiant than the sim : 
In Apocalypse is its fashion said 
As deviseth it the Apostle John. 

" Even as it met the Apostle's sight, 
Saw I that city of great renown, 
The New Jerusalem, royally dight 
As it was let from heaven adown. 
Its bulwarks burned with gold so bright, 
As burnished glass that gleams around. 
With noble gems all underpight. 
And pillars twelve on their bases bound: 
On twelve gi-eat slabs the Lord did fomid 
Those walls, and each a precious stone ; 
As standeth written of this fair town 
In Apocalypse of the Apostle John." 

It will be seen that under the stress of his 
exacting task Mr. Coulton has had resort not 
only to grossly defective rhymes (mead, shed ; 
renown, adown, around, bound, found, town), 
but to words (as "un-hide") that can hardly 
pass muster under his term " archaic." If we 
must offer a glaring example of his eccentricities 
in diction, his forty-sixth stanza stands ready.

" The date of day the lord did know 

And called to the Reeve : ' Let pay my meinie : 

Give them the hire that I them owe; 

And further, that none may me repreuy, 

Set them all upon a row 

And give to each alike one penny. 

Begin at the last that standeth low 

Till to the foremost thou atteny.' 
And then the first began to pleny, 
And said that they had travailed sore: 
* These but one hour did strive and streny ; 
Us- think us ought to take full more.*" 

Surely this cannot be accepted as modem En- 
glish, or as English at all. Of our six transla- 
tors, Mr. Coulton alone has failed, and that not 
through defect of scholarship but for want of art. 
In turning to Professor Jewett's recent version 
(issued in holiday form and also in plain binding 
for class-room use) we soon realize, as with Dr. 
Mitchell's, that we are reading a poem trans- 
lated by a poet. To illustrate the fvdl group of 
five stanzas, and to make, at least in part, com- 
parison with these two other renderings in the 
original metre, we cite the New Jerusalem sec- 
tion, one of the most difficult in the whole elegy. 

" ' This flawless sight I will not hide ; 

Up toward the brook's head thou must go, 

While I will follow on this side. 

Till yonder hill the city show.' 

And then I would no longer bide, 

But stole through branches, bending low. 

Till from the summit I espied. 

Through green boughs swaying to and fro, 

Afar, the city, all aglow. 

That brighter than bright sunbeams shone. 

In writing it is pictured so. 

In the Revelation of St. John. 

" As John the Apostle saw the sight, 
I saw that city, standing near 
Jerusalem, so royal dight. 
As if from Heaven alighted here. 
The city all of gold burned bright. 
Like gleaming glass that glistens clear. 
With precious stones beneath set right : 
Foundations twelve of gems most dear. 
Wrought wondrous richly, tier on tier. 
Each base was of a separate stone 
As, perfectly, it doth appear 
In the Revelation of St. John. 

" John named the stones that he had seen, 
I knew the order that he made; 
The first a jasper must have been. 
That on the lowest base was laid. 
Beneath the rest it glinted green ; 
A sapphire in the second grade; 
Chalcedony, from blemish clean, 
In the third course was fair arrayed ; 
Fourth, emerald, of greenest shade. 
Fifth, sardonyx, was raised thereon; 
The sixth a ruby, as is said 
In the Revelation of St. John. 



" John joined to these the chrysolite, 
The seventh gem in that basement; 
The eighth, a beryl, clear and white; 
The topaz, ninth, its luster lent; 
Tenth, chrysoprase, both soft and bright; 
Eleventh, the jacinth, translucent; 
And twelfth, and noblest to recite. 
Amethyst, blue with purple blent. 
The wall above those basements went 
Jasper, like glass that glistening shone; 
I saw, as the story doth present, — 
The Revelation of St. John. 

" I saw, as John doth clear devise: 
The great stones rose like a broad stair ; 
Above, the city, to my eyes. 
In height, length, breadth appeared four-square ; 
The jasper wall shone amber-wise. 
The golden streets as glass gleamed fair; 
The dwellings glowed in glorious guise 
With every stone most rich and rare. 
Each length of bright wall bailded there 
For full twelve furlongs' space stretched on, 
And height, length, breadth all equal were: 
♦ I saw one mete it,' writeth John." 

Here we have verse moving as simply and 
with as little apparent self-consciousness as 
prose — translation whose fidelity is instinctive, 
grace answering to grace. It is not too much 
to say that Miss Jewett's translation crowns the 
series. The original stanza is kept through the 
whole poem, without a single concession to 
imperfect rhyme. Monotony is avoided by 
special skiU in the placing of the csesura and 
the sentence-stops, giving an effect of variety 
and ease. The movement is completely musi- 
cal, though occasionally asking of the reader, as 
above in " basement " and " translucent," the 
stressing of a normally unaccented syllable. The 
wording, at once simple and poetic, has distinc- 
tion. Imagination and feeling are in full play, 
the translator seeing what the mediaeval dreamer 
saw, and, with him, wondering and rejoicing at 
the vision. This unknown author of " The 
Pearl " is thus apostrophized by Miss Jewett in 
a prefatory stanza : 

" Poet of beauty, pardon me 
If touch of mine have tarnishfed 
Thy Pearl's pure luster, loved by thee ; 
Or dimmed thy vision of the dead 
Alive in light and gaiety. 
Thy life is like a shadow fled; 
Thy place we know not nor degree, 
The stock that b«)re thee, school that bred ; 
Yet shall thy fame be sung and said. 
Poet of wonder, pain, and peace, 
Hold high thy nameless, laurelled head 
Where Dante dwells with Beatrice."

Henley's liiTERARY Monument.* 



No writer could ask of the piety of his sur- 
vivors a more substantial memorial than has 
been reared to Henley in the new edition of 
his works. But the cere jmrennius nobody can 
build out of a mere fulness of fair, clear pages : 
an artist has to rear his own monument. Mean- 
while, it is pleasant that so rich a token should 
be laid like a wreath upon the memory of a 
strong man in his and our day. Henley's career 
did not go altogether as he had planned it. 
Years ago he wrote of himself (in a preface not 
included in this edition) : " After spending the 
better part of my life in the pursuit of poetry, 
I found myself [about 1877] so utterly un- 
marketable that I had to confess myself beaten 
in art, and to addict myself to journalism for 
the next ten years." The implication is that he 
recognized prose art to be not within his prov- 
ince. And indeed it was not. He produced 
no prose comparable with his verse, though all 
of it was useful and much of it brilliant. How- 
ever, his journalism was of the type which has 
produced and maintained the great English 
reviews. One of his most remarkable attributes 
was his extraordinary faculty of discovering and 
bringing out young or unrecognized talents. 
He was a great editor. But as we are now for 
the first time in possession of everything of his 
which is likely to be reprinted, as we see it 
all together and get its effect as a whole, the 
question we naturally ask ourselves is what he 
amounted to, not as a man but as a writer. 

His prose occupies in this edition five of the 
seven volumes. The two volumes of " Views 
and Reviews" suggest, he says, "less a book 
than a mosaic of scraps and shreds recovered 
from the shot rubbish of some fourteen years 
of journalism." But it is a patchwork of 
exceedingly rich materials. These brief and 
flashing notes upon great writers and painters 
express a criticism personal and impressionistic, 
but full of life. Here, indeed, rather than in 
the two volumes of essays, we find the prose 
Henley whom we like to remember. For leisure 
seems to have had a queer effect of developing 
in him a tendency to truculence, above all a 
tendency to dwell with a sort of defiant gusto 
upon those aspects of greatness which the world 
as a whole is anxious to ignore. 

Henley has been called a Pagan, perhaps 
believed himself to be one ; but there is no such 
person in the modern world — or at least no

such person is now articulate. We protest too 
much, and in the end prove ourselves to be mere 
inverted Puritans. Henley's hatred of cant and 
sentimentalism led him to extremes of utterance. 
His Introduction to the Centenary edition of 
Burns had not the obituary ring and lacked the 
dispassionateness fairly to be demanded under 
the conditions. That was not the place for a 
protest or a manifesto. The substance of his 
contention as to Burns's character is hardly to 
be seriously disputed ; we have the poet's own 
frank evidence to go by. Nor do we suppose 
that Henley was unjust to the memory of 
Stevenson in the substance of his unguarded and 
greatly resented protest against Balfour's fancy 
picture. To cover his friend's memory with 
silver-gilt really seemed to him an act of treach- 
ery. But in his hasty attempt to set that friend 
before the world as a man human in his faults as 
well as in his virtues, he allowed himself to be 
offensive. He could not be calmly judicious, 
and often appeared cynical, because he could 
not bear the thought of appearing sentimental. 
But this is not all. As you read over these 
two volumes of carefully considered essays, you 
are aware of a tendency to dwell upon sexual 
frailty which represents not merely a revulsion 
against prudery. He is not prurient, but he 
has that dangerous pride in his faculty of call- 
ing a spade a spade which ends in keeping one 
unnecessarily on the lookout for that useful but 
not ornamental object. He is very severe with 
Burns for his lewdness, but (although he resents 
Taine's label of Fielding as the " Good Buffalo " 
and pronounces him one of the best of men) 
declares that he has no doubt there was a Lady 
BeUaston in Fielding's own experience, and that 
" The Matthews and BeUaston episodes were 
profitable to Fielding: profitable and deemed 
in no sort reprehensible." It is hard enough to 
stomach the Lady BeUaston relation in connec- 
with Tom Jones : are we to be required to ac- 
cept it of Fielding with this bland complacency, 
while in the same breath we call him, with 
Henley, "■ a humane, stately, and honourable 
gentleman"? Even so he dwells upon the 
fleshly failings of Smollett and of Hazlitt, — 
above all, of Balzac ; so that in the end one 
wearies at the insistence with which this oije 
harsh string is sounded. Henley's criticism 
has notes far sweeter and sounder, though it is 
his nature and intent to be robustious rather 
than agreeable. Get him away from his hobbies, 
absorb him in his theme and not in his effect, 
and you find yourseK in the presence of a crit- 
icism sound as well as independent.

[Dec. 16, 



The volume of plays, joint work of Henley 
and Stevenson, is disappointing to read, if one 
takes it up with the expectation of finding 
therein anything of real dramatic importance. 
" Beau Austin " is a finished comedy of eight- 
eenth century manners. We can easily under- 
stand why it should have " acted well," but it 
is, after all, no more than a bit of pleasant arti- 
fice. The three other plays are meritorious 
studies in melodrama. " Deacon Brodie " is a 
sort of Dr. Jekyl reduced to the Adelphi con- 
vention ; it would have a real and lively interest 
for the gallery. " Admiral Guinea " is less 
conventional, and therefore less acceptable as 
melodrama. "Macaire" the authors call a 
" melodramatic farce "; but it seems to be rather 
a piece of very light romantic comedy suddenly 
cut short by a shocking catastrophe. The sketch 
was successfully produced, but it is hard to see 
how any gallery can have put up with it. 

In the end, our judgment of Henley's achieve- 
ment rests upon his two volumes of poetry. For 
here is a true and fresh lyric note. He was one 
of the few veritable singers of his day, whether 
the burden of his song might be war, or love, or 
work, or the life of the street. His poems of 
the London hospital and the London highway 
have naturally been more highly praised for 
their originality, their modernity, — in short, 
their timely or journalistic quality. They are 
excellent poems in their class; but the poet's 
reputation will linger rather in the perfect lyrics 
of " Hawthorne and Lavender " or in the stout 
war-songs of " For England's Sake."

trial in renewed strength and purity. Grown 
to womanhood in Italy, in the companionship of 
her father, a scholarly recluse, she comes back 
to her own English land after his death, and 
takes a country house. She has become fitted 
into her new sphere of life, and has given her 
heart to a rising young statesman, when the 
blow falls, and she learns the secret of her 
father's secluded existence, and of the tragedy 
that had darkened his life at the time of her 
early childhood. For it seems that her mother 
had been drawn into a network of wickedness, 
had killed a man in a moment of passion, and 
had been the central figure in a murder trial 
that had been the sensation of its day. Diana's 
new friends know of this tragic prelude to her 
life, but cannot bring themselves to break the 
truth to her, and she learns it just as she has 
become betrothed. She imparts the revelation to 
her lover, who is not strong enough to accept the 
situation thus changed ; he thinks too much of 
his career and too little of his love, and weakly 
lets her go. The scene of the story then changes 
from England to Italy, whither Diana flees with 
her wounded heart. Presently her former lover 
discovers that his weakness in the critical hour 
of their relationship has reacted upon his politi- 
cal career, that his power is broken, and he is 
on the point of physical collapse. He realizes 
what he has lost, and in the end persuades Diana 
to return to him. This is the bare outline of 
the story which Mrs. Ward has told us with all 
the technical mastery we have learned to expect 
from her. The merit of the work rests almost 
wholly upon its technical virtue, and upon the 
author's intimate and accurate knowledge of the 
social and political circles in which her charac- 
ters have their being. It is all so extremely 
well informed, and so thoroughly well done, that 
it is difficult to understand why we should not 
be more deeply moved by it and why it should 
not make a more lasting impression. For the 
story, even in its climactic scenes, leaves us 
comparatively cold, and seems to illustrate anew 
the fact that the ultimate aim of creative art 
may be defeated by an excess of calculation and 
a too obvious reliance upon literary artifice.

Unless Mrs. Ward can escape from the well- 
defined pattern which her latest novels have 
assumed, the continuance of her vogue will be 
a matter of mere momentum, and not the sign 
of a vitalizing influence. 

Mr. Max Pemberton has given us a surpris- 
ingly good novel in his " Sir Richard Escombe," 
a tale of England in the middle years of the 
eighteenth century. It has for its central feature 
the notorious doings of the dissolute roisterers 
who made Medmenham Abbey a name of evil 
import, and it relates the manner in which the 
disreputable Society of St. Francis was brought 
to an end. It is, of course, Mr. Pemberton's 
titular hero who is the appointed means of so 
praiseworthy an achievement; and we follow 
his career with deep interest, although his type 
— that of the daredevil Irish soldier — has been 
worked pretty hard by earlier novelists. The 
heroine also, appropriately named Kitty, is of 
the sort that always goes with this particular 
kind of hero, being by turns witty, pert, wilful, 
and unreasonable, yet ail the time sound at heart, 
and the pattern of constancy. Mr. Pemberton 
has worked up his " manners and customs " in 
a way that we find rather surprising, when we 
recall the extent to which he has hitherto relied 
upon sheer invention for his effects. He may 
have done this by a diligent reading of other 
novelists, from Thackeray down, but he cer- 
tainly has achieved an easy familiarity with the 
dialect and the fashion of the period. His tale 
is thus given an unexpected richness of texture, 
and this, in addition to a fairly creditable plot, 
makes it a highly readable piece of work. 

Curiously enough, there is an echo of the 
revels at Medmenham Abbey in "Wroth," the 
latest romantic invention of Mr. and Mrs. 
Castle. Lord Wroth, known as " Mad Wroth," 
comes into possession of his ancestral estate. 
Hurley Priory, just before the time of Waterloo, 
and, with the aid of certain choice and reckless 
spirits of his acquaintance, renews the sort of 
sacrilegious revelry that had made the Society 
of St. Francis notorious some two generations 
earlier. One wild autumn night, when the 
revels are in full swing, the Lady Juliana, 
Contessa di Belgiojoso dei Vespi, travelling by 
post in that neighborhood, is captured and 
brought into the Priory, being mistaken for a 
lady of light virtue whose arrival has been 
expected. The effect upon Wroth is magical, 
for he becomes her champion, expels the rout 
of his followers, and sends his guest upon her 
way with due honors. This constitutes the 
prologue to a romance of tense emotionalism and 



happy outcome. Wroth develops into a truly 
Byronic hero, pursues his lady all over Europe 
(after the death of her aged and wicked spouse), 
defends her against all comers, and eventually 
wins her. The tale is prolonged by a curious 
invention. The hero is on the verge of bank- 
ruptcy, and a marriage is the only condition 
upon which he may preserve his fortune. With 
characteristic recklessness he offers himself in 
the open market, and weds, as he supposes, the 
brazen creature for whom Lady Juliana had 
been mistaken in the prologue. But his bride 
is veiled, and is no other than the heroine her- 
self, who has effected an ingenious substitution 
at the critical moment. Consequently, the sub- 
sequent long pursuit is really the pursuit of his 
lawful wife — the fact known to her, but un- 
dreamed of by him. This raises a pretty moral 
issue, for the love which he offers her is an 
unlawful one, as far as his own knowledge goes, 
and she would feel degraded by its acceptance. 
It is only in the act of desperate renunciation 
that he learns the truth, thus redeeming himself 
in the sight of his lady, and winning her by his 
very willingness to make the sacrifice. The 
interest of the situation becomes fairly breath- 
less as we near the close, and it is with a sigh 
of relief that we witness the untangling of the 
coil. 

A stirring and hearty tale, written in boyish 
humor, about a hero who remains a boy in spirit 
all the way through, is given us in " The Big 
Fellow," by Mr. Frederick Palmer. Even at 
college, James Harden towered over his fellow- 
students, and his thews won for him athletic 
distinction. Fortunately, his moral plan was 
upon the same large lines, and his personality 
was magnetic as well as imposing. We first 
meet him as he is about to leave college, and go 
home to his native town in the Middle West, 
where he is eagerly awaited by a household 
consisting of mother, an aunt, and an adopted 
daughter. He finds their affairs at a crisis, 
and learns at how great a cost of privation his 
education has been secured. It will be a task 
to set the family upon its feet, but he feels equal 
to it, and goes to work with health, strength, 
and temperamental optimism for his sole assets. 
Going to the city, he takes the first employment 
that offers, and joins a gang of laborers engaged 
in street railway construction. He also studies 
law, and gets an occasional job of newspaper 
reporting. He is the sort of man who is bound 
to succeed, and hence we are not surprised to 
find him, a few years later, a lawyer waging 
successful warfare upon " grafters," a wearer of

judicial robes, and the one man who is chosen

possessions, then recently acquired. In the 
story of his Philippine career is the real sub- 
stance of the book, for he engages in the work 
with zest and high purpose, slowly acquires 
the confidence of the natives, becomes their 
friend and counseller, sets about providing them 
with schools, and successfully opposes the 
humanitarian ideal to the ideal of military 
harshness in the management of their affairs. 
It will be seen from this brief statement that 
the author is a believer in " benevolent assimi- 
lation " — that catchword which at its best 
stands for iminformed sentimentalism, and at 
its worst for cant and hypocrisy. He seems to 
have espoused in entire sincerity the " sacred 
obligation " theory of our dealings with the 
Filipinos, and he does what is possible to genial 
rhetoric in making that theory seem plausible. 
It is, of course, easy to identify the Big FeUow, 
as far as many of the traits of his character and 
incidents of his career are concerned, with a 
certain conspicuous personage of our times, 
although the drawing is more or less composite. 
But Mr. Palmer's envisagement of the whole 
problem is essentially superficial, and his mouth- 
ings about duty and destiny will ring hollow to 
readers who have followed with anything like 
close attention the history of our unfortunate 
experiment in imperialism. There is a love 
interest in the book, as prettily sentimental as 
the political interest, and the story is very 
agreeable to read, despite the underlying falsity 
of its conception. 

" The Little Brown Brother " is a story that 
proclaims by its very title that it has to do with 
Philippine affairs. It is the work of an English- 
man, Mr. Stanley Portal Hyatt, who fought in 
the American ranks at Samar, and knows the 
scenes whereof he writes. Its point of view is the 
antipodes of that from which Mr. Palmer's roseate 
picture is painted, for the American writer is on 
the side of the civil government, whereas the 
Englishman reserves all his sympathies for the 
military branch, and treats the civilian rulers as 
incompetent and even criminal in their methods. 
Mr. Hyatt's view is urged with great force, and 
illustrated with vivid pictures ; logically consid- 
ered, it reduces Mr. Palmer's argument to a 
sentimental " frazzle." If a civilized people is 
going to burden itself with the rule of savages, 
it must perforce adopt stern measures. As be- 
tween the imperialism of British tradition, and 
the imperialism diluted with sentiment of our 
recent American concoction, it seems fairly clear 



that the former gets the better of the argument. 
Once admit the general principle that superior 
races have a right to govern inferior ones, and, 
as a corollary, the justice of our own wanton 
subjugation of the Philippine peoples and Mr. 
Hyatt's conclusions follow logically enough. 
The Asiatic, whether Indian or Malayan, must 
be made to " know his place "; his conqueror 
must " civilize him with a Krag "; since gentler 
methods are wasted upon him, all talk about 
" the little brown brother " must be stigmatized 
as pestilential nonsense, and the very mention 
of humanity must be met with a sneer. This 
standpoint Mr. Hyatt consistently assumes, and, 
writing from it, has passed scathing judgment 
upon our management of the whole wretched 
business. We must not, however, convey the 
notion that he has written a mere tract ; he has, 
on the contrary, told a story of absorbing 
romantic interest, although a story involving so 
complicated a tangle of faction and motive that 
it is not altogether easy to understand. Of 
course, neither Mr. Hyatt nor Mr. Palmer faces 
the underlying fact that our original occupation 
of the archipelago was without any real justifi- 
cation, and was undertaken in violation of the 
most sacred principle of our national existence. 
France was the focus of the world's interest 
in the years 1793-7, and things happening 
elsewhere at that time seem relatively unim- 
portant in the pageant of world-history. Yet 
the period of the Terror and the young French 
Republic was one of much excitement through- 
out Europe and even in America, which excite- 
ment was, of course, largely occasioned by the 
turbulent doings on the banks of the Seine. 
In our own country, these were the years of 
Washington's second term, and the years when 
the French Revolution became an acute issue in 
American politics — the years of Citizen Genet, 
and Jay's Treaty, and the Whiskey Rebellion. 
All this material, besides much of minor signifi- 
cance, is utilized in " The Red City," a novel 
by Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, linked at a few points 
to his " Hugh Wynne," but quite independent 
in its interest. The hero is a young emigre^ 
who does not sulk in his tent, but fits himself 
into the life of the new country, even becomes 
one of the smaller cogs in its system of govern- 
ment, and finds happiness in the love of a 
Quaker maiden. The story is related with all 
the deft literary skill to which Dr. Mitchell has 
accustomed us, and enriched by all the wealth 
of his minute historical knowledge. In French 
matters, he slips occasionally, for enfantillage 
is not feminine, canaille does not take a plural.

and a performance by Mademoiselle Mars 
could not very well have been witnessed by an 
eighteenth-century hero. But these are trifles, 
and in general Dr. Mitchell's picture of life, 
political and social, during the later years of 
Philadelphia's glory as the capital of the nation, 
is rich and satisfying. But we would not be 
taken as meaning that " The Red City " is an 
archaeological narrative only ; on the contrary, 
it is a real story of real human interest, and 
its action is often exciting beyond the limits of 
Quaker sobriety. 

Mr. George Gary Eggleston, in his " Two 
Gentlemen of Virginia," does not take us as 
far back in our history as Dr. Mitchell, and 
does not concern himself so largely with public 
matters ; but the method of the two novels is in 
so far similar that both rely largely for their 
effect upon close attention to details, and are 
written from fulness of knowledge. Mr. 
Eggleston's knowledge is the product of his own 
boyhood recollection, and is for that reason the 
more exact and vivid. He writes of the period 
just preceding the outbreak of the Civil War, 
and his book is an honest one, although rather 
commonplace in style and invention. It more 
than redeems the pledge of its name, for it 
acquaints us with at least three gentlemen of 
Virginia, and the finest of the three is the old 
Colonel , of whom the title-page gives no promise. 
We also have portraits, much after our own 
heart, of two ladies of Virginia, one young and 
one old, and both of the kind in which it is 
good to believe. 

" The Trail of the Lonesome Pine " is melo- 
drama, but it is also conscientious and artistic. 
Mr. Fox has upon several previous occasions 
given proof of his quality as a novelist, and of 
the peculiar sympathy which he brings to the 
study of the Kentucky mountaineer ; but his 
latest book is even better than its predecessors, 
for it is more richly wrought and more secure 
in its grasp of character. Its interest centres 
in the heroine, whose growth from rudeness to 
refinement is portrayed with nicety of shading 
and a clear comprehension of the evolutionary 
process. The wilding charm which is hers by 
nature is not effaced by education or by contact 
with the outside world, and she returns to her 
native surroundings unspoiled by culture. Once 
only, we fear that she is going to disappoint us ; 
for the man who loves her, and to whom she 
owes her education, has had a hard struggle 
during her absence and has grown careless of 
his person and his ways. The revelation of this 
fact is a shock to her, and her gratitude is for 



a moment in abeyance. But this temporary 
revulsion of feeling soon gives way, and his love 
is returned in rich measure when she realizes 
all that he has done for her. A mountain feud 
supplies the melodramatic element of the nai'ra- 
tive, and is the basis of its most exciting epi- 
sodes. Of this the author makes an effective 
psychological use also, as he portrays the struggle 
between the clan-spirit and the conception of 
social order, between the personal view and the 
impersonal one, in the minds of the heroine and 
her kindred. Another main feature of the 
story is provided by the growth and collapse of 
an industrial " boom," the account of which is 
almost as well done as Theodore Van Dyke's 
account of a similar happening in Southern 
California a quarter of a century ago. These 
are but suggestions of the substance of the book, 
and of the reasons why it offers so much more 
than mere entertainment. 

" The Diva's Ruby" completes the trilogy of 
novels in which Mr. Marion Crawford has un- 
folded the career of Margaret Donne, and even 
before this story is ended, we cannot but feel 
that the prima donna lags superfluous on the 
stage. The magnate of the nickel trust wins 
her in the end by promising to build her an 
opera house in America. The Greek financier, 
thus plante la, consoles himself with an untu- 
tored Tartar maiden who has been wandering 
over Europe in male attire, peddling stolen 
rubies, and seeking to rim down a certain Rus- 
sian who has treated her so brutally that she 
wishes him for a husband. Learning that the 
Russian is dead, she philosophically puts up 
with the Greek. These are among the prepos- 
terous inventions to which the author resorts in 
his endeavor to keep alive our interest in " Fair 
Margaret" and her entourage. The whole 
affair is fustian, and will add nothing to Mr. 
Crawford's reputation. 

A mysterious murder, and a group of char- 
acters upon each of whom in turn suspicion for 
the crime is fastened, — this is a fairly familiar 
programme, carried out more or less successfully 
by every writer of detective stories. Mr. Web- 
ster's " The Whispering Man " belongs to the 
class of the more successfid, because of the pre- 
cision with which the parts of the plot are fitted 
together, and the clock-work regularity of the 
action. When the mystery is cleared up, our 
surprise is genuine but not violent, for reflection 
reveals the fact that it has been foreshadowed 
by a series of carefully calculated incidents, and 
if we have failed to see their significance it is 
clearly our own fault. This is the method of

the story as disclosed by analysis ; but the man 
who tracks the murderer depends upon sheer 
intuition, and goes straight to his aim without 
resorting to the laborious process of deductive 
reasoning. The " whispering man," who pre- 
tends to join in the search, turns out to be the 
criminal himself ; his vocal affection seems to be 
an irrelevant matter, attributed to him solely for 
the purpose of providing the book with a non- 
committal and alluring title. 

When Bulwer wrote " The Coming Race," 
basing it upon his conception of " vril," a means 
of destruction so potent and far-reaching as to 
make warfare henceforth impossible, he set the 
model for a long line of romantic inventions 
founded on the same general idea. The latest 
of these inventions is '' The Man Who Ended 
War," by Mr. HoUis Godfrey, and the author's 
" vril " takes the form of Hertzian waves, which 
are brought under such control that they may 
be projected from any distance to fall upon a 
given object, wiping it utterly and instantan- 
eously out of existence. The force acts upon 
metals only, which are at once dissipated by its 
attack . Having perfected his invention , the hero 
(if we may apply that title to one who works in 
secret and makes practically no appearance upon 
the scene) notifies the governments of the great 
powers that he will, unless disarmament is effected 
within a year, proceed to destroy one by one all 
the battleships of the world. The communica- 
tion is treated lightly enough until the year 
passes, and then, as one battleship after another 
is mysteriously annihilated, it becomes a subject 
of pressing concern . The climax is reached when 
two great navies, arrayed in battle-line against 
one another, are destroyed before they have got 
fairly into action. Meanwhile, three light-hearted 
young people, being a brother and sister who are 
electricians, and a newspaper reporter who is in 
love with the sister, are engaged in fathoming 
the mystery, and in tracking the agent of destruc- 
tion. Science, good luck, and inspiration, all 
aid them in the task, and they are on the point 
of success when the annihilation of the fleets 
brings the nations to their senses, and a plan of 
general disarmament is adopted. The ingenious 
inventor is disposed of at the moment when his 
figure stands revealed. He is, figuratively speak- 
ing, " hoist by his own petard," since he becomes 
a victim of the very force which he has wielded 
for the destruction of others. This is a conven- 
ient outcome, but it would otherwise be difficult 
to know what to do with him. 

A man unjustly sentenced for a crime of 
which he is innocent contrives to escape from 



his Arizona prison, and wanders far into the 
desert. He hides in a remote oasis, with a 
burro for his only living companion, and lives 
a Robinson Crusoe existence for some years. 
Incidentally, he discovers a gold mine in his 
retreat. During this season of solitude, he 
undergoes both physical and moral regenera- 
tion ; and when he at last ventures forth into 
the civilized world, he is endowed with renewed 
health and an altruistic purpose before un- 
known to him. Then a young woman comes 
into his life, and makes it worth while. As a 
matter of poetic justice, the scoundrel who had 
been the cause of the unjust conviction gets his 
desert, and evidence turns up which clears the 
name of the hero. This is the substance of Miss 
Adeline Knapp's " The Well in the Desert," a 
story in which the rough realism of frontier 
life in the Southwest is curiously blended with 
delicate sentiment and spiritual motive. The 
combination is effected with singular skill, and 
the product is deeply interesting, equally so 
whether we view it as a picturesque and dra- 
matic recital of incident or as a study of the 
development of a human soul.

Essays and General Literature. 
" Why has the reign of peace and good-will upon 
the earth been so long delayed ? " asks Dr. Crothers 
in the opening essay of his collected pieces entitled, 
as a whole, " By the Christmas Fire" (Houghton). 
This question the five bright and suggestive essays 
of the book may in a general way be regarded as 
attempting to answer, although the fourth, on " The 
Ignominy of Being Grown-Up," is rather entitled to 
be ranked as pure literature, delightfully guiltless 
of a purpose except to amuse. The others — " The 
Bayonet-Poker," " On Being a Doctrinaire," "Christ- 
mas and the Literature of Disillusion," and "Christ- 
mas and the Spirit of Democracy " — chime in very 
well with this holiday season of peace and good-will 
and of attempts (on the part of the Salvation Army 
and others) to promote the happiness of the many 
and hasten the coming of the millennium. But the 
fortunate ones who, with large means or command- 
ing abilities, are dealing telling blows at poverty and 
wrong, are not encouraged in self-complacency. The 
Spirit of Democracy, we read, " laughs at the preten- 
tions of the Strong and the Wise and the Rich to have 
created the things they possess. They are not the 
masters of the feast. They are only those of us who 
have got at the head of the line, sometimes by unman- 
nerly pushing, and have secured a place at the first

table. . . . They are not benefactors, but benefici- 
aries." A symbolical frontispiece and other ingen- 
ious drawings, from the pencil of Miss Frances Bassett 
Comstock, adorn the book. 

In a small volume most inviting to bibliophiles 
not yet so desiccated as their parchment or papyrus 
treasures, Mr. Austin Dobson has reprinted sundry 
short, light, and often amusing pieces in prose and 
verse that were originally published in various period- 
icals. " De Libris " (Macmillan) is the book's short 
and sufficient title. Scraps of curious and interest- 
ing book-chat alternate with exquisite fragments of 
Dobsonian verse. Here are a few headings from the 
table of contents, to whet the appetite : — " Some 
Books and their Associations," " The Passionate 
Printer to his Love," " A Pleasant Invective against 
Printing," "The Books of Samuel Rogers," " Fresh 
Facts about Fielding," " Cross Readings — and Caleb 
Whitefoord." Caleb Whitefoord, let us add in 
explanation, wrote in 1766 a letter to Woodf all's 
" Public Advertiser," complaining of the miscellan- 
eous, unconnected, and altogether profitless character 
of newspaper reading matter, and suggesting that 
more pleasure and quite as much profit could be 
derived by reading straight across the page, regard- 
less of column divisions. He then gave examples of 
the sprightly and astonishing news items thus discov- 
ered in even the dullest sheet : as, — " Yesterday the 
new Lord Mayor was sworn in and afterward toss'd 
and gored several Persons." Delicate line drawings 
from various sources enliven this enjoyable volume. 
That it is often reminiscent of the eighteenth cen- 
tury was to be expected from its authorship. 

Quaintly archaic is the sub-title of Mr. Arnold 
Haultain's treatise on " The Mystery of Grolf " 
(Houghton). It reads thus : " A briefe Account of 
Games in generall ; their Origine ; Antiquitie ; & 
Rampancie : and of the game ycleped Golf e in 
particular : its Uniqueness ; its Curiousness ; & its 
Difficultie ; its anatomical, philosophicall, and moral 
Properties ; together with diverse Conceipts on 
other Matters to it appertaining." That is a tour 
de force, surely enough ; but little attempt is made 
to carry the archaisms through the book. It is 
simply a present-day golf-enthusiast's enamoured 
account of the delights of his favorite pastime. The 
half-dozen pages given to " The Origin of Games " 
do not suffice to take one very far back into the 
investigation of the play-instinct in man ; nor are 
the remarks on the " anatomical, philosophicall, and 
moral properties " of golf unfathomable in their 
profundity. But the well-conceived and cleverly 
executed little treatise is amusing, especially to 
golfists ; and if they wish to own it they should take 
early action, as the edition is " strictly limited." 
The author, be it noted, is not a Frenchman, despite 
his name ; he is described as " an Anglo-Indian by 
birth, who has been for many years the literary 
assistant and co-worker of Mr. Goldwin-Smith, in 
Toronto, Canada." The book, like the series of 
limited editions to which it belongs, is a beautiful 
piece of work. 



The delicate banquet of choice literature which 
Mr. Mosher sets before his guests every year is 
always awaited with eager interest by the lever of 
books. This year its pUce de rSsistance is a superb 
edition of "The Poetical Works of Oscar Wilde," a 
volume for whose beauty of mechanical production 
and painstaking editorial equipment it would be 
difficult to find words of praise that should be ex- 
aggerated. Every detail of this edition is marked 
by faultless taste, and the volume is a delight to the 
bookish sense. It is, moreover, a definitive edition, 
for it includes all the poems before published, and 
two dozen hitherto uncollected pieces. The " Poems 
in Prose " are also included. There is an editorial 
introduction, a bibliographical index, and a set of 
facsimile title-pages of the original editions. A 
portrait, dated 1892, is the frontispiece. A dozen 
smaller books are also included in Mr. Mosher's out- 
put of the present year. Of these, none is more 
welcome than that which gives us Eugene Lee- 
Hamilton's " Sonnets of the Wingless Hours," a work 
that seems fairly assured of a lasting place in our 
literature. Mr. John Vance Cheney's " The Time 
of Roses " is a volume of thirty-five ( Shakespearian) 
sonnets, with lyrics interspersed, which quicken our 
sense of the charm of this delicate melodist. Three 
English poets who have recently died — Henley, 
Lionel Johnson, and Francis Thompson — are rep- 
resented, the two former by volumes of selections, 
the last by a single poem, but his most famous one, 
"The Hound of Heaven." Wordsworth's "Immor- 
tality " ode is another single-poem booklet. The 
poetry of a primitive age is represented by that 
fourteenth-century gem, " The Pearl," done into 
modern English and provided with a critical intro- 
duction and a bibliography by Miss Marian Mead. 
The rest of Mr. Mosher's offerings are prose : 
Hazlitt's " Liber Amoris " heads the list, and has 
for a suitable companion " Ann : A Memory," by 
De Quincey. Then there are "Three Legends of 
the Christ Child " and " Nature Thoughts," being 
two little books by " Fiona Macleod," and, last of all, 
"Toward Humanity," a selection of brief passages 
from the writings of Robert G. IngersoU. On the 
whole, we should say that it would be a difficult 
taste that could not find satisfaction in some part of 
the menu which Mr. Mosher has provided for this 
season. 

Travel and Description. 

In two large octavos, " The Rivieras of France 
and Italy " by Mr. Gordon Home, and " Venetia and 
Northern Italy " by Mr. Cecil Headland, the Mac- 
millan Co. begin a series called " Old World Travel," 
which is designed to include books on Italy, Greece, 
Palestine, and Egypt. " It is hoped," says the an- 
nouncement, " that the various volumes will not 
only prove welcome to the traveller during his visit, 
and serve as pleasant reminders of bygone days, 
but will also bring the different districts vividly 
before the minds of those who are unable to leave 
home." The volumes at hand, are well fitted to 
fulfil this destiny. Both are illustrated in color —

clear, brilliant Italian color — from paintings by 
Mr. Home, and both contain also numerous black- 
and-white reproductions of his drawings. Both 
give — usually in outline, sometimes in detail — 
the history of places described, and both avoid 
dreary enumerations of hotels, trains, and other 
mechanical matters. Mr. Home says of the Riviera 
that it " may be described as a collection of jewels 
strung together at irregular intervals on a rough 
mountain chain "; and he deprecates the fact that 
the English have disregarded the jewels at the east- 
ern end of the chain, especially the Gulf of Spezia, 
and Lerici. He conducts the traveller from Mar- 
seilles to Pisa, stopping at every point of beauty, 
and projecting its present charms against a carefully 
studied background of the past. The stay-at-home 
reader will perhaps wonder if this background is 
not too intrusive ; but the traveller who uses the 
volume on the spot will be grateful for all the facts 
given. Mr. Headland says of his book that "it 
deals in outline with the history, architecture and 
art of the towns of Northern Italy which lie within 
the triangular plain bounded on the north by the 
Alps, on the west by the Appenines, and on the 
east by the Adriatic Sea." Beginning with the 
Lombard Lakes, " the Gates of Italy," he opens 
the whole region to the appreciation of the art-lover 
and the traveller. He writes delightfully, and his 
characterizations are so clear and beautiful that they 
linger in the mind. If the additional volumes of 
the series unite as well as this the artist's vision 
with the tourist's zeal, they will become, as the pub- 
lishers desire, " indispensable to the traveller." 

Mr. Frederick S. Dellenbaugh has shown no un- 
seemly haste to rush into print with his account of 
the important Powell exploring expedition down 
the Green and Colorado Rivers, in which he took 
part nearly forty years ago. But now, Major John 
W. Powell and Prof. Alvin H. Thompson, the 
leaders of the enterprise, being dead, and no one 
else likely to leave on record a full account of this 
memorable and at times dangerous piece of inland 
waterway exploration, he at last overhauls his 
diaries and notes, and collects other related matter, 
to furnish a substantial and extremely interesting 
volume on the subject. He names his book, " A 
Canyon Voyage: The Narrative of the Second 
Powell Expedition down the Green-Colorado River 
from Wyoming, and the Explorations on Land, in 
the Years 1871 and 1872." The first Powell ex- 
pedition was made in 1869, and of this, as well as 
of the second expedition, Major Powell wrote an 
official report in his well-known " Exploration of 
the Colorado River of the West, 1869-1872," 
which, however, goes into no such details as Mr. 
Dellenbaugh has favored us with in his work. He 
calls the book " practically volume two " of his 
earlier " Romance of the Colorado River," and it 
might almost as well be considered a supplement to 
his " Breaking the Wilderness." No one could well 
be more at home in his subject than Mr. Dellenbaugh. 
His illustrations, half a hundred in number, are 



chiefly from photographs, and are clear and good. 
There is a colored frontispiece of the Grand Canyon, 
and a serviceable index. The volume is handsome 
and strongly made. (G. P. Putnam's Sons.) 

Tourists to Spain, and also those whose travels 
are of the fireside sort, will find in "Southern Spain" 
(Macmillan), as chromatically illustrated by Mr. 
Trevor Haddon and described by Mr. A. F. Calvert, 
a sumptuous and well-informed handbook. It is to 
the pictures rather than to the letterpress that the 
modest author himself calls the reader's appreciative 
attention, and they certainly are a conspicuous 
feature of the book, being seventy-five in number, 
all full-page and all most strikingly colored — too 
strikingly, in fact, one might maintain. But some- 
thing must be allowed for impressionism in the 
treatment of life and landscape in the sensuous, 
sunny South. A few words from Mr. Calvert's 
preface will indicate the plan and purpose of the 
volume. " Few travellers," he says, " have leisure 
enough to traverse the wide realm of tawny Spain 
in its every part. Those who must confine their 
attention to a single province naturally select 
Andalusia, where all the Northerner's preconcep- 
tions of the South find realization. . . . The pre- 
sent volume, mainly the embodiment of personal 
impressions and observations, is intended partly to 
supply the place of a guide-book to this part of the 
Peninsula, and with that object I have brought 
together as much of history, art, and topography as 
the traveller is likely to assimilate." The book is 
uniform with Mr. Edgar T. A. Wigram's " Northern 
Spain," and is provided with a good map. 

Miss Esther Singleton has added a volume called 
"' Great Rivers Described by Great Writers " 
( Dodd, Mead & Co. ) to the numerous compilations 
she has already made. Even to a person who had 
thought of rivers as furnishing a possible subject 
for a book, it must be a surprise that there was such 
a wealth of material to draw from. Victor Hugo's 
glowing words repeat his impressions of the Rhine 
and the Loire; Dickens tells of a trip down the 
St. Lawrence (was he so fair to it because it is more 
Canadian than American ?); Pierre Loti pictures 
the Ganges, Thoreau the Concord and the Merri- 
mac, and Mrs. Richings the Irrawaddy. All the 
rivers of the earth which are great either in size or 
in association are described by competent writers. 
It is a disappointment to find Mark Twain barred 
from the Mississippi, but perhaps that was a case 
of " no bottom." The accounts are various in 
character, some statistical and some impressionistic, 
and they show entertaining variety of style, the 
height of dignified propriety being reached by Dr. 
Timothy Dwight, who notices in the Connecticut 
"a frequency and elegance of meanders, and an 
absolute freedom from all aquatic vegetables." But 
for all the " personal importance " of the mightily 
flowing streams, the little Oise brings the reader the 
happiest memories, because it won Stevenson to 
sing its praise. Fifty excellent half-tones enforce 
the vividness of the descriptions. — Another volume

in the same series is devoted to " Switzerland 
Described by Great Writers," and again shows 
Miss Singleton's careful editing. The first division 
of the book deals with the country and the race, the 
second with their history, the third with Alpine 
climbing, the fourth is descriptive purely, the fifth 
sets forth social life among the Alps, and the last is 
devoted to statistics. The names of Ruskin, Tyndall, 
Goethe, and Victor Tissot are in the list of writers. 
Mr. Edward Whymper's exciting account of the 
first ascent of the Matterhorn alone makes the book 
notable. The many half-tone illustrations give beau- 
tiful views of mountains and lakes. 

Miss Lilian Whiting disclaims for her fascinating 
volume on "Paris the Beautiful" (Little, Brown, 
& Co.) any pretense of being a complete study of the 
city, but says it is " a little record of the crystalized 
enchantment of many springtimes and early sum- 
mers " spent there. It is, in truth, just such a record 
as actual and would-be lovers of Paris will welcome, 
because it shows the city not only in its outward 
fairness but in its beauty of intellectual and artistic 
achievement. Nor is it a " little " record, for the four 
hundred pages are literally packed with what one 
would most wish to know about streets, buildings, 
paintings, statues, men, and events. Most unique 
and satisfactory of all, it pictures Paris in its activity 
to-day. The work that is being done by scientists 
is reported as if from the laboratory, and that of 
artists from the Salons of last spring. Men like 
Rodin, Richet, the scientist Landor, and many others, 
are described in connection with labors now in hand. 
Miss Whiting's spirit is that of enthusiastic admira- 
tion of the Parisians, whose chief characteristic she 
considers is " imaginative intensity "; and admiration 
also of the city, whose atmosphere she finds not one 
of frivolity and wickedness, but of " light and color, 
of the keenest and most sympathetic human response 
in joy or sorrow, — an atmosphere, too, that is peopled 
with lofty visions and with ideals of loveliness." The 
volume is acceptably bound in cloth, with a vista of 
the Bois de Boulogne in color on the cover, and 
numerous half-tone illustrations, many of them from 
recent paintings. 

The serious-minded go to Egypt to see the Pyra- 
mids and study inscriptions. But even they — and 
still more all frivolous travellers who go to Egypt, 
and elsewhere, for amusement — will appreciate Mr. 
Lance Thackeray's effort to picture and describe ' ' The 
Light Side of Egypt" (Macmillan). Mr. George 
Ade, in a brief but pungent preface, characterizes 
the book thus : " For a real picture of Egypt — 
prop up the dusty antique in the background, put 
bewildered tourist into foreground, then flood with 
sunlight. This is what Mr. Thackeray has done." 
Crafty dragoman, " very good donkey," and easy- 
gaited camel are also conspicuous and entertaining 
foreground features. Mr. Thackeray's comments 
on his pictures allow none of their amusing implica- 
tions to escape the eye of the reader, so that his 
appeal is by no means limited to those who have 
climbed the Pyramids themselves (see illustration 



entitled •■' The Climbers ") or engaged in an involun- 
tary game of cup and ball — the "camel's favorite 
game." Especially will it be valuable to persons who 
are planning to visit Egypt in the near future, and 
are not averse to seeing themselves as others may 
see them and getting all the possible fun, as well as 
profit, from the adventure. 

No writer on American birds is more thoroughly 
at home in his subject than Mr. Frank M. Chapman, 
Curator of Ornithology at the American Museum of 
Natural History, and author of several well-known 
works on the bird-life of our continent. His latest 
book, " Camps and Cruises of an Ornithologist " 
( Appleton) is the fruit of seven years of field work 
in which, he tells us, he has devoted the nesting 
season of birds to collecting specimens and making 
studies and photographs on which to base a series of 
what have been termed " Habitat Groups " of North 
American birds, for the Museum. Two hundred 
and fifty photographs from nature have supplied 
pictures for the book; and in photographing the 
birds care has been taken to provide a suitable back- 
ground. Great panoramic views, some of them 
twenty-eight feet in length, have been painted to 
give in each case the characteristic shore, marsh, 
prairie, plain, desert, forest, or mountain height, as 
the proper haunt of the bird or birds before the 
camera. The descriptive matter has, of course, 
been prepared with equal attention to accuracy, and 
the whole is a notable contribution to bird lore. 

As long as rivers run down to the sea the Rhine 
wUl continue to be a favorite stream with travellers 
and nature-lovers. No river is so rich in both natural 
beauty and historic and legendary association. Not 
even the Tiber or the Thames or the Danube fills so 
large a place in song and story, in politics and his- 
tory. Mr. H. J. Mackinder's book on " The Rhine " 
(Dodd), illustrated in color after Mrs. James Jar- 
dine, is a substantial and handsome volume, histori- 
cal and descriptive, tracing the course of the great 
river from its origin in the Grisons to its many- 
mouthed discharge in the Netherlands, and bestowing 
a side glance on some of the river's chief tributaries. 
Physical geogi'aphy, political history, and romantic 
legend contribute each its share toward the making 
of the book. The colored views have the merits and 
the faults of such attempts to catch the hues of nature 
in the pages of a printed volume ; but some of the 
plates are at least pleasing in effect. The work 
shows careful study and patient labor, and is good to 
read by itself or to use as a supplement (even though 
a "colored supplement") to Murray or Baedeker. 
The two elaborate maps of the Rhine basin (northern 
and southern sections) and the four simpler charts 
of smaller districts are valuable additions. 

"New Zealand, painted by F. and W. Wright, 
and described by Hon. William Pember Reeves, High 
Commissioner for New Zealand" (Macmillan), 
carries us to a land little familiar to general travel- 
lers, but much written about of late, and sometimes 
represented as all but Utopian in its admirable labor 
laws and enlightened manners and customs. Mr.

Reeves takes pleasure in referring to the enviable lot 
of the New Zealand laborer and artisan, and quotes 
the testimony of Mr. Keir Hardy, who, " after a tour 
round the Empire, deliberately picks out New Zear 
land as the most desirable country for a British 
emigrant workman." The reading matter of the 
book, divided into seven chapters, deals with country 
life, sport and athletics, the fast disappearing forests 
of the colony, the outlying islands, and other mat- 
ters, with a concluding word to the tourist. Seventy- 
five illustrations, each having as many colors as 
Joseph's coat, give an aspect of gaiety to this sober 
but interesting account of a far distant country. A 
folded map at the end of the book helps to a better 
understanding of New Zealand geography. 

Miss Anne Rollings worth Wharton has an agree- 
able way of making her European travels narrate 
themselves in the conversation or letters of various 
fictitious or disguised characters endowed with 
wholesome curiosity and with alertness of observa- 
tion. The characters are also well-read and, in gen- 
eral, of the literary habit of mind. "An English 
Honeymoon" (Lippincott) treats of certain favorite 
haunts of England very much as the earlier " Italian 
Days and Ways " pictured pleasantly a number of 
scenes and events in the travels of three women in 
Italy. Mrs. Walter Leonard, in the later book, is 
supposed to describe her wedding journey in a series 
of letters to her friend Mrs. Allan Ramsay. Canter- 
bury, York, Warwickshire, Cornwall, the Lake re- 
gion, the Land of Lorna Doone, and other districts 
rich in tradition and historic or literary association, 
are visited by the happy pair, who also devote some 
time to their kodak, or otherwise procure a number 
of very good photographs of scenes visited, and re- 
produce them for the reader's benefit in the book. 
It is an attractive volume and written in Miss 
Wharton's best style. 

So acceptable to book-buyers have Mr. Gordon 
Home's pictures and descriptions of Yorkshire scenes 
proved themselves that he is encouraged to collect 
and issue in one generous volume his three smaller 
works treating of different parts of that largest of 
the English counties. "Yorkshire" (Macmillan) 
is uniform in general appearance and in excellence 
of workmanship with the other similar works issued 
from the same press. It is preeminently a picture- 
book, having seventy-one brightly-tinted illustrations, 
as well as a map of the region described. The pages 
given to Whitby and the adjacent stretches of coast 
recall Lowell's love of the old red-roofed town and 
its abbey, which became very familiar to him in 
the last summers of his life. Scarborough, with its 
castle, and with its curious story of the mayor who 
was once tossed in a blanket, is another interesting 
place. Mr. Home knows well how to give variety 
of interest to his pages — pages, too, that are admir- 
ably printed in the clearest of Scotch-face type. 

The " Greater Abbeys of England " ( Dodd) receive 
a worthy tribute in the goodly volume by Abbot 
Gasquet, illustrated in color after Warwick Goble. 
The book is devoted to the history of these build- 



ings, not to the more frequently considered subject 
of their architecture. If the general reader is not 
interested in all the details of the revenue and estate 
of the monasteries in their times of prosperity, he is 
profoundly glad of a book which brings together the 
facts of their building — and alas ! in most cases of 
their partial destruction also — and which holds 
consistently to the subject with which it intends to 
deal. Canterbury, Tintern, Westminster, and all 
the others, will seem even more wonderful to him 
when he views them through the ideal perspective 
of their legendary and historic past. The pictures 
of them in this volume, even of those most patheti- 
cally " ruined, dismantled, and time-worn " are very 
beautiful, and a possession in themselves. 

Generously illustrated from photographs, paint- 
ings, and old prints, Mr. Fredei'ick W. Watkeys's 
two-volume work on " Old Edinburgh " (L. C. Page 
& Co.) is an attractive and serviceable book of its 
kind. The character of the work is more specifi- 
cally indicated by the sub-title, " An account of the 
ancient capital of the kingdom of Scotland, including 
its streets, houses, notable inhabitants, and customs 
in the olden time." The outcome, as the author 
explains in his preface, of a recent pleasant sojourn 
in the Scottish capital, his book will be a welcome 
companion to other sojourners and of interest to 
intending visitors. It makes no claim to being 
exhaustive, nor does it seek to supersede older and 
more learned historical accounts of the famous city. 
" Rather," says the author, " has it been my inten- 
tion to bring before the reader the principal and 
interesting events in the history of the Old Town 
which have made her famous. With these has been 
given some account of the manners and customs of 
her old-time citizens, together with certain details 
relating to the ancient life of the city, which are 
not obtainable without considerable research among 
antiquarian lore." Wilson and Chambers have been 
drawn upon for much information. Especially inter- 
esting are the chapters on the Castle, the Canon- 
gate, literary Edinburgh and the University, the old 
Tolbooth, and old manners and customs. 

" Washington : the City and the Seat of Govern 
ment " (John C. Winston Co. ) is a compact, useful, 
and also ornamental volume from Mr. C. H. Forbes- 
Lindsay's practiced pen. History and description, 
and sufficiently minute details concerning our 
governmental machinery, are relieved with numer- 
ous agreeably tinted photographic views of principal 
buildings and places of interest. The pages that 
treat of journalism in Washington, the educational 
institutions of the city, the Library of Congress, and 
other matters relating to learning and literature, are 
especially inviting. The chapter on the social life 
of the capital is also good reading, but (best of 
praise) too short. Of importance to the antiquary 
are the appended reminiscences of one Christian 
Hines, who was twenty years old when the city was 
founded, and died in his ninetieth year, leaving 
behind him some memoranda descriptive of early 
Washington and its buildings. These notes, first

published in his eighty-fourth year, are now made

Biography and Memoirs. 

The fierce light that beats on a throne seldom 
spares the near relatives of that throne's occupant. 
Napoleon's brothers and wives have received their 
share of attention from the historian, and his mother 
and sisters are the subjects, collectively or singly, of 
several French studies in minute biography. But 
in English there has been little attempt to make us 
intimately acquainted with " Madame Mfere " and 
her three daughters, Elisa, Pauline, and Caroline. 
Now, however, Mr. H. Noel Williams sees his 
opportunity and offers us two substantial volumes 
on "The Women Bonapartes " (Scribner). His 
previous studies in French female biography have 
fitted him for his present task, and he seems to have 
undertaken it with zeal and relish. The treatment 
of his theme is chronological, and necessarily intro- 
duces many important characters, both male and 
female, besides the Bonaparte ladies. The events 
of the period also call for due mention, so that the 
work is really an account of the life and times of 
Napoleon from a fresh point of view. The numer- 
ous portraits and other illustrations are all that could 
be desired. 

" Cornish Characters and Strange Events" (Lane) 
industriously compiled by Mr. S. Baring-Gould, and 
adorned with "sixty-two full-page illustrations repro- 
duced from old prints, etc.," is a volume of nearly 
eight hundred pages filled with all sorts of curious 
matter. In general arrangement it is a collection 
of biographies of those Cornish celebrities who have 
escaped interment in the National Cemetery so ably 
planned and laid out and filled by Leslie Stephen 
and his successor in the editorial chair. Cornwall's 
comparative isolation, as the author remarks, " has 
tended to develop in it much originality of character ; 
and the wildness of the coast has bred a hardy race 
of seamen and smugglers ; the mineral wealth, more- 
over, drew thousands of men underground, and the 
underground life of the mines has a peculiar effect 
on mind and character." A forty-thi'ee-page index 
conveys some idea of Cornwall's wealth in note- 
worthy characters. How the subject could have been 
more exhaustively treated, the reader of this thick 
octavo would find it hard to indicate. In form and 
substance it is a companion volume to the author's 
" Devonshire Characters and Strange Events." 

From the pen of Sir Walter Scott's great-grand- 
daughter, the Hon. Mrs. Maxwell-Scott of Abbots- 
ford, there comes a well-written, clearly-printed, 
and handsomely illustrated biography of "Madame 
Elizabeth de France, 1764-1794" (Longmans). 
The "angelic Princess," youngest sister of Louis 
XVI., has probably never been so engagingly pre- 
sented to English readers as now by Mrs. Maxwell- 
Scott ; and she has moreover based her narrative on 
contemporary and other French authorities whose 
writings, as a whole, have not been available to earlier 
students in this field. The life and times of Madame 



Elizabeth are not wanting in dramatically effective 
incidents, and the writer has turned them to good 
account, especially in the chapter describing the 
tragic end of her heroine. Fourteen illustrations, 
four of them colored, are scattered through the book, 
and an index, a list of authorities consulted, and 
occasional footnotes are also provided. 

Some people, including Charles Lamb and Mr. 
Crosland, cherish a constitutional antipathy for the 
inhabitants of North Britain ; but a good many others 
find something exceedingly winsome in the Scotch 
character. To these others a new edition of Dean 
Ramsay's " Reminiscences of Scottish Life and 
Character " (McClurg), with some very lifelike and 
often, in a sober, quiet way, delightfully humorous, 
illustrations in color by Mr. H. W. Kerr, will be wel- 
come. As a rule, books of jokes are, for uninterrupted 
perusal, rather tiresome reading ; but this famous col- 
lection of Caledonian traits and humors and oddities 
has sufficient body and substance, enough connecting 
tissue, so to speak, to make it capable of yielding sus- 
tained enjoyment. Not the least remarkable feature 
of it is its objective and detached manner, even 
though it is from the pen of a thoroughbred Scotch- 
man. The author recognized — no one better — that 
cautious and canny element in his countrymen which 
is so often turned to ridicule by outsiders. " Can you 
play the fiddle ? " was once asked of an unmusical 
Scot, and his finely non-committal answer was that 
" he couldna say, for he had never tried." This and 
all the other peculiarly Scottish idiosyncrasies and 
obstinacies and whimsicalities are most entertain- 
ingly illustrated in the book. 

A " new and revised edition " of Mr. H. Noel 
Williams's "Madame de Pompadour" (Scribner), 
first published six years ago, has made its appear- 
ance. As this is the only formal biography in 
English of Louis XV.'s accomplished and skilful 
favorite, it is not surprising that it should run into 
a second edition, especially as it is written in an 
agreeable manner and at the same time bears 
evidences of careful and scholarly workmanship. 
Besides other claims on the world's attention, 
Madame de Pompadour was the prime mover in the 
establishment of the Sevres porcelain works, and in 
the founding of the Ecole Militaire, which in its 
twenty-seven years' existence furnished France with 
many distinguished military commanders, including 
Napoleon. As the author further reminds us, " she 
protected Voltaire and Montesquieu, rescued the 
elder Cr^billon from poverty and neglect, encour- 
aged Diderot and d'Alembert in their herculean 
labours, and made the fortune of Marmontel "; so 
that, whatever may have been her faults, she has 
certainly deserved well of the republic of letters. 
A portrait, engraved from Boucher's painting, 
serves as frontispiece. 

Holiday Fiction. 
"The Ruby of Kishmoor " (Harper) gives full 
play to Mr. Howard Pyle's gift for inventing wild 
adventures, while the nine illustrations in color show

his matured pictorial art at its best. Jamaica is 
the scene of the story. There the splendid ruby of 
the Rajah of Kishmoor is the centre of a romantic 
tale in which pirates of the high seas mingle with 
Quakers from Philadelphia, mysteriously lovely 
women, and desperate viUians with one eye, silver 
ear-rings, or a broken nose to distinguish them from 
peaceful citizens. In the end the ruby goes 
a-begging, for Jonathan Rugg turns his back on 
fabulous wealth and tropical romance to marry a 
Philadelphia Quakeress and live quietly and happily 
ever after. 

The Countess Diane, in the novelette named after 
her, walks barefoot on a Breton beach, is kidnapped 
and carried off in a motor-car by a terrible Russian 
Prince, is pursued and rescued by two benevolent 
American automobilists, one of whom speedily finds 
himself desperately in love with her, in spite of the 
ill-fitting peasant costume in which she has disguised 
herself. Needless to say, the tale furnishes plenty of 
excitement, while colored pictures and decorations 
by Mr. John Rae, and a dainty cover, make of it a 
very attractive gift-book. (Dodd, Mead & Co.) 

No part of General Lew Wallace's " Ben-Hur " 
could better serve the purpose of spirited illustration 
than that descriptive of the chariot-race and the 
events immediately preceding. In a thin octavo, en- 
titled "The Chariot-Race from Ben-Hur " (Harper) 
this fragment of the popular novel is republished with 
four colored pictures designed by Mr. Sigismond 
Ivanowski — not counting the blue-and-gold cover 
illustration showing the four-horse chariot in full 
career. The frontispiece represents the victorious 
qtuxdrigce straining for the goal and leaving a con- 
fusion of inter-tangled rivals in the rear. The next 
picture shows us Ben-Hur leading forth for trial 
the horses he is to drive. Then comes the scene 
where the memorable wager on the race is accepted ; 
and finally we have a group of eagerly expectant 
faces watching in agonizing suspense the progress of 
the competing chariots. 

Mrs. Hugh Eraser's "The Heart of a Geisha" 
(Putnam) is the sweetly pathetic story of a Japanese 
dancing girl, whose wit and beauty saved her lover's 
life. Colored border designs are gay with lanterns, 
flowers, and Japanese garden scenes. Every alter 
nate page is devoted to a small picture of some 
Japanese flower, and a photogravure frontispiece 
adds a touch of elegance to the book. 

Anthologies and Compilations. 
The success of Mr. E. V. Lucas's anthology of 
English letters, "The Gentlest Art," has inspired the 
publishers (Macmillan Co.) to issue a companion vol- 
ume devoted to the productions of American letter- 
wi'iters. Miss Elizabeth Deering Hanscom is the 
editor, and the title is " The Friendly Craft." The 
division headings and the titles for the separate letters 
have a decided Lucas touch, and the choice of material 
is based on the personal appreciation of the editor 
that puts Mr. Lucas's work so far above that of the 
mechanical compiler. As for the letters, all patriotic 



Americans will be proud to find that the epistolary 
art has flourished so gaily amid the bustle and hurry 
of the New World. Everyone who owns " The 
Gentlest Art " will want " The Friendly Craft " to 
place beside it on his shelves. 

A group of poetical anthologies in dainty bind- 
ings may properly be counted among the year's gift 
editions. " The Rose- Winged Hours " (Longmans) 
is the suggestive title that Mr. St. John Lucas has 
chosen for his collection of English love lyrics. It 
is not intended to be complete, but is merely, as 
Mr. Lucas describes it in the preface, " a garland of 
familiar flowers " meant to appeal to the jaded taste 
of a public too hurried to cull the flowers of poetry 
for itself. The book is prettily bound in blue and 
gold, with decorated end-papers. — An anthology 
that will appeal to nature-lovers and especially to 
bird-students and lovers is "The Bird in Song" 
(B. W. Dodge & Co.), edited by Robert Sickert. 
A photogravure of the king of birds forms the 
frontispiece. The poems comprising the collection 
are, with one or two exceptions, from English 
sources, the range of dates extending from Shake- 
speare to Tennyson. — Many famous poems, from 
Gilbert's " Bab Ballads " to Hood's " Song of the 
Shirt," first saw the light in the London " Punch." 
Mr. Francis C. Burnand has taken advantage of 
this fact to collect some " Poems from Punch " not 
so well known as those just referred to but well 
worth knowing. His book is issued as a new vol- 
ume in Messrs. H. M. Caldwell Co.'s " Remarque 
Series," a popular miniature edition. 

There is certainly no lack of attractive year books 
for 1909. Mr. Wallace Rice is the compiler of two, 
"The Washington Year Book " and " Catchwords of 
Patriotism," both published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg 
&, Co. The former is a companion volume to the 
" Lincoln Year Book " of last year. The maxims 
and morals of "the Father of His Country" are 
embellished with marginal sketches in tint, and the 
cover is adorned with tiny silhouettes of the first 
President. The patriotic " catchwords " are printed 
on pages whose borders show the American eagle, 
and Simmons's picture of Liberty forms an appro- 
priate frontispiece. — "The Carolyn WeUs Year 
Book" (Holt) of "old favorities and new fancies " 
will help to make 1909 more amusing for almost 
anyone. There are verses, anecdotes, "twisted" 
proverbs (nonsense and fun for all seasons), with 
pictures by a variety of artists, including Mr. Oliver 
Herf ord. — " Keep up Your Courage " ( Lothrop, 
Lee & Shepard Co.) is the alluring title of Miss Mary 
AUette Ayer's book of quotations. The sub-title, 
" Keynotes to Success " will suggest the character of 
its quotations, which, while they are not arranged 
for special dates, are meant to serve the same general 
purpose as the regular year books. — " The Pleasant 
Thought Year Book " ( Holt) is compiled by Mr. R. J. 
DuBois, who has gleaned its contents in many delight- 
ful literary byways. The small size of the volume 
will commend it to many, and its bright cover and 
clear print will please others.

Not the least valuable, though possibly the small- 
est volume in the year's crop of Lincoln books, is 
"The Wisdom of Abraham Lincoln" (A. Wessels 
Co.), being extracts from Lincoln's speeches, state 
papers, and letters. The make-up of the volume is 
exactly similar to " The Pocket R. L. S.," a fact 
which attests to the good taste, but scarcely to the 
originality, of the publishers. 

" Catchwords of Friendship " (McClurg) is a 
collection of two hundred wise and witty sayings 
about the making, keeping, and value of friends. 
Each page is decorated, and the frontispiece, title- 
page, and end-papers are printed in two colors, which 
gives a holiday touch to the little book. 

Holiday Editions of Standard Literature. 
It is twenty-one years since the poet-naturalist 
(he was a novelist also, as well as a miscellaneous 
contributor to periodicals), Richard JefEeries, died at 
the age of thirty-nine, leaving an astonishing num- 
ber of books to his credit, the majority of them deal- 
ing with those aspects of nature and forms of wUd 
life with which he had early cultivated a loving 
familiarity. There are now republished, with 
appropriate illustrations in color, two of his most 
characteristic and interesting works, " The Life of 
the Fields" and "The Open Air" (Lippincott). 
Miss Maud U. Clarke furnishes colored illustrations 
for the former, and Miss Ruth DoUman for the lat- 
ter. The drawing is good, and the coloring some- 
times shows much painstaking skill, but necessarily 
has its faults in the printed reproduction. How- 
ever, the pictures do bring back the country air and 
scents and sounds. It was in 1884 that " The Life 
of the Fields " first appeared in book-form with 
prefatory acknowledgment to those periodicals from 
which the several chapters were reprinted. The 
republication now, without date, of this preliminary 
acknowledgment conveys (however unintentionally) 
an impression of first publication — to the unwary. 
The reprint is timely ; nature study is in vogue ; 
and Jeff eries is almost as pleasant to read as is our 
own poet-naturalist whose name has long been a 
household word. 

Mr. George Alfred Williams, who has already 
illustrated Dickens's "Carol" and "Cricket," and 
other selected portions of his works, now turns his 
skilful hand to the pictorial interpretation of "The 
Chimes " (Baker & Taylor Co.), providing for this 
ever-popular Christmas story six full-page illustra- 
tions in color, four in black and white, and a number 
of smaller line drawings in the text. An introduc- 
tion fi'om his pen traces the history of the tale from 
its conception in September, 1844, to its completion 
in November, its illustration by the four celebrated 
artists. Leech, Doyle, Stanfield, and Maclise, and its 
publication in successive editions, of which the later 
ones have been illustrated by artists whom he thinks 
even more in sympathy with the human quality of j 
Dickens's work than were the Ulustrators who were 
his friends and contemporaries. Mr. Williams has 
studied his predecessors' efforts in the difficult task 



of depicting the Dickens characters ; and while 
one would hesitate to affirm that he has on the 
whole surpassed them, he has certainly given us pic- 
tures that have character and are pleasing. A hand- 
somer edition of "The Chimes" could not well be 
asked for. 

"Tales by Edgar Allan Poe," with colored illus- 
trations by Mr. E. L. Blumenschein, is a handsomely 
printed, wide-margined, but somewhat inflexibly 
bound volume from the house of Duffield & Co. The 
words "Centenary Edition " on the title-page remind 
one of the near approach of that wonderful year in 
which Poe and so many other celebrities were born. 
Seven of the best known tales are selected, and each 
is provided with an appropriately weird and horrible 
picture, both the drawing and the coloring doing their 
best to intensify the shivers and the shudders of the 
spellbound reader. Especially gruesome is the design 
accompanying " The Masque of the Red Death." 
The pictures as a whole are like nothing on or under 
or above the earth, but so are the stories, for that 
matter ; hence their reciprocal fitness. 

Three of the most popular of the Waverley 
novels — " Ivanhoe," " Kennilworth," and " The 
Talisman " — have been issued by the J. B. Lippin- 
cott Co. in a handsome holiday edition. Each vol- 
ume contains twelve beautiful full-page illustrations 
in color, from drawings made especially for this 
edition. The type is both readable and attractive, 
the paper of fine quality, and the binding of dark 
red cloth, with decorations in gold leaf, is rich and 
appropriate. Prefaces by the Hon. Mrs. Maxwell 
Scott of Abbotsford add to the interest of the edition, 
which is well worthy of Scott's best work. 

Longfellow's " Song of Hiawatha " is reprinted 
in the so-called " Minnehaha Edition " by Messrs. 
Rand, McNally & Co. There are many full-page 
pictures in tint, besides appropriate headings and 
decorative initials. The canvas cover shows an 
Indian design reproduced in the gay colors that the 
Navajo rug-weavers love. — " Evangeline " is issued 
this year as a companion volume to the " Wooing of 
Hiawatha," published last winter by Messrs. John 
W. Luce & Co. Paper and board-covers cleverly 
simulate birch-bark ; there are dainty decorations in 
colors, and a lacing of leather thongs adds a further 
touch of novelty to the little book. 

" Tennyson's Love Poems " is the title of a com- 
pilation arranged by Miss Ethel Harris and pub- 
lished, with illustrations from famous paintings and 
border designs in tint, by Messrs. Rand, McNally 
& Co. Over seventy of Tennyson's poems are 
reprinted. The cover is attractively designed, but 
the coloring is decidedly crude. 

Holiday Booklets and Calendars. 
Among the Christmas booklets of serious import, 
Mr. Hamilton Wright Mabie's " Christmas To-day " 
(Dodd) will be sure to find many readers. Its 
theme is the meaning of the old Christmas story for 
the world of to-day, and it is handled in Mr. Mabie's 
accustomed easy and readable style. There are

no decorations except on the very attractively 
designed board covers. — " The Higher Sacrifice," 
by President David Starr Jordan of Leland Stanford, 
is published by the American Unitarian Association. 
Presswork, paper, and board covers are all attract- 
ive, and the subject, the free gift of one's best 
powers to those less fortunate, is well suited to the 
holiday season, with a new year of life imminent. — 
President Woodrow Wilson recently made a Bacca- 
laureate address to a class of Princeton seniors on a 
theme very similar to President Jordan's: the joy 
of sacrifice. This is now published in a dainty 
booklet, entitled "The Free Life" (Crowell).— 
"Quatrains of Christ" (Paul Elder & Co.) is 
described, in a brief preface by Mr. Julian Haw- 
thorne, as a sort of Christian Rubaiyat. Not only 
are the stanzas in form like FitzGerald's, but the 
symbolism is oriental. The spirit, however, is quite 
different, being reverent, virile, optimistic. A frontis- 
piece, cover design, borders, and initial letters espe- 
cially drawn, are the decorative features. — " What 
Does Christmas Really Mean?" is the suggestive 
title of a little book whose title-page explains that it 
contains a " sermon begun by John T. McCutcheon, 
continued by Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and published for 
Santa Claus by The Unity Publishing Company of 
Chicago." The McCutcheon cartoon supplies a cover- 
design and a frontispiece, as well as a point of .de- 
parture for the text. The page borders suggest 
Christmas greens. — In " The Sea of Faith " 
(American Unitarian Association) Mr. Milton Reed 
shows that there have always been doubts and dif- 
ferences of religious opinion in the world, and that 
scepticism is not so modem a disease as one might 
think. His optimistic outlook gives to his essay the 
appropriate tone for the Christmas season. 

A handful of gift-books of an unpretentious but 
not unattractive sort must be noticed in a group. No 
one understands the art of writing amusing trifles 
better than tliat versatile artist-author, Mr. Oliver 
Herford. " Cupid's Almanac and Guide to Hearti- 
culture" (Houghton) is the joint production of Mr. 
Herford and Mr. John Cecil Clay. The latter is 
responsible for half of the daintily colored illustra- 
tions ; while the other half, the absurd jingles, and 
the ingenious descriptions of the Proposal Plant, the 
Hammock Vine, the Cosey Cornia, and many other 
flowers and weeds that grow in Cupid's garden, are 
Mr. Herford's. — Mr. Robert Williams Wood, who 
last year taught many appreciative readers " How 
to Know the Birds from the Flowers," has written 
and illustrated some "Animal Analogues" (Paul 
Elder & Co.) in which the subtle but unmistakable 
resemblances between the eel and the elephant, the 
puss and the octo-pus, the P-cock and the Q-cumber, 
and others, are deftly set forth in Mr. Wood's char- 
acteristically bouyant and convincing style. — " The 
Smile on the Face of the Tiger " (Bacon & Brown) 
is the diverting title of a diverting collection of 
limericks, new and old, the one about the confiding 
young lady of Niger being accorded the place of 
honor at the head of the list. The sources are 



indicated at the end of the book, the names of well- 
known " limerickians " jostling those of dignified 
citizens like President David Starr Jordan and Pro- 
fessor Arlo Bates. — "All in the Same Boat " (Life 
Publishing Co.), text and pictures by Mr. James 
Montgomery Flagg, is a made-to-order gift for any 
friend with a sense of humor and a European trip 
to look back upon. Diverting quatrains and absurd 
caricatures depict the familiar types to be found on 
shipboard, and in some other places too, since the 
ship is really the world in miniature. — "The Sim- 
ple Jography ; or, How to Know the Earth and Why 
It Spins " (Luce) acknowledges Mr. Oliver Herford 
as " editor " and joint illustrator with Miss Cecilia 
Loftus, whose contribution consists of " imitations 
of pictures." The book contains many laughable 
remarks on an amazingly wide variety of topics, 
including some delicious bits about President Roose- 
velt. — Hitherto Mr. Robert Seaver has contented 
himself with illustrating other men's verses ; but in 
"Ye Butcher, Ye Baker, Ye Candlestick-Maker" 
(Houghton) he has written some quaintly humorous 
characterizations of old-time types, which are exactly 
suited to illustration in the antique wood-cut style 
that he uses so successfully. Spelling, print, paper, 
border-patterns, and binding are all in harmony 
with the old-style pictures and text. — The Cynic's 
Calendar for 1909 (Paul Elder & Co.) is entitled 
" The Perfectly Good Cynic's Calendar," and Mrs. 
Ethel Watts Mumford Grant, Messrs. Addison 
Mizner and Oliver Herford have cooperated in its 
production. There is the usual assortment of cyn- 
ically distorted proverbs, and a new feature in the 
shape of " perfectly good prognostications," their 
object being to " Enable Everyone to enjoy Every- 
thing without Remorse, Expense, or Indigestion." — 
" Cupid the Surgeon," by Herman Lee Meader, with 
pictures in color by " Pal," is a treatise on the fine 
art of love-making, with full directions for pursuing 
it to a successful finish. Pictures printed in red and 
a fat Cupid repairing a broken heart on the cover 
give the decorative touch. (Altemus Co.) 

Two fables, "The Little Brown Hen Hears the 
Song of the Nightingale " and " The Golden Har- 
vest," both by Mrs. Jasmine Stone Van Dresser, 
are printed together in a small volume, with illus- 
trations in tint, colored page-borders, and cover of 
Japanese wood-boards with pictorial inset (Paul 
Elder & Co.). Both fables teach the lesson of 
patient contentment ; the little brown hen knew 
how to find sweet notes among barnyard noises, 
and the russet apple-tree hid her sorrow over her 
green apples that would not redden. 

From Mr. T. Hasegawa of Tokio comes a delight- 
ful array of Japanese calendars, all made in Japan, 
and done up in slip covers of Japanese paper or in 
Japanese boxes. The larger calendars are decorated 
with modern reproductions of rare old prints. There 
is a Hokusai calendar, with two prints slipped in so 
that when the owner is tired of one he may put the 
other on top; and a Hiroshige calendar to corre- 
spond. A beautiful floral calendar has twelve sheets, 



1908.]

one for each month ; and there are twelve street 
scenes in silhouette in a dainty case that has the 
effect of a frame. For lovers of the grotesque 
there is a fat and ugly idol, with depending paper 
streamers which hold the calendar. Panel prints 
make effective calendars, with a decidedly Japanese 
air about them. Booklets of various sizes, printed 
on crinkled paper, with gay decorations, combine 
the utility of a calendar with the unique interest 
attaching to a foreign book. Altogether we know 
of no more artistic calendars than these from far 
Japan. 

Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. have followed their 
usual custom in issuing a large and attractive variety 
of calendars for 1909, and a number of pretty wall 
mottoes and cards. The mottoes are most of them 
illuminated after the style of the old missals, and 
many of the calendars are in the same style, with 
Scripture passages or stanzas of poetry on the dif- 
ferent sheets. The " Brooks Calendar," with selec- 
tions from Phillips Brooks's sermons, is a pleasing 
example of this type. Another " Brooks Calendar," 
less ornate but more comprehensive, has a pad with 
a selection for each day in the year. The " Ingoldsby 
Calendar " and the " Mother Goose Calendar " are 
very cleverly illustrated in bright eolors. " The 
Lullaby Calendar " and " Our Cats " will appeal, re- 
spectively, to lovers of babies and of fluffy angoras. 
The " Lincoln Calendar " is timely in view of the 
Lincoln centenary. The " Madonna Calendar," in 
various sizes to suit different tastes and purses, and 
the Fra Angelico calendar, are beautiful examples 
of color-printing. And these are only a few among 
the many titles which the Messrs. Button have to 
offer. 

The object of the " Rubric Series " of Messrs. 
Buffield & Co. is to reproduce in handy and attract- 
ive form some great documents not easily obtainable 
in any desirable reprints. Two recent volumes con- 
tain, respectively, " The Sermon on the Mount " and 
'* Poor Richard's Almanac," printed, like the rest of 
the series, in two colors, with marginal borders and 
pleasing covers. 

Miscellaneous Gift-Books. 
One can imagine no more delightful subject for 
an artist's brush than "The Flowers and Gardens 
of Japan" (Macmillan). Miss Ella Bu Cane is 
the illustrator, and Miss Florence Bu Cane furnishes 
the text. The Japanese theory of landscaping is 
interesting in all its details — and its details are 
almost endless. Then there are the temple gardens, 
planted and arranged with reference to their sacred 
character. There are the nurseries where the dwarf 
trees, in infinite variety of size and species, are 
grown with infinite patience. There are the fav- 
orite blossoms, — the plum, the cherry, the chrysan- 
themum, the wistaria, the lotus, — each with its 
especially beautiful gardens and the quaint and 
charming festivals associated with its blossoming 
time. Surely no excuse is needed for writing a 
book, — the first of a popular character, — about the 



flora of " The Land of Flowers." But if one were 
needed the pictures would furnish it. The artist 
has chosen her subjects with regard both for beauty 
and variety of theme, and the resulting color-plates, 
printed by the finest modern processes, are exquisite. 
As a garden book or a book about Japan this one is 
full of interest. 

A series of books devoted to art and literature, 
and called the "Art and Letters Library" (Buffield 
& Co.), is inaugurated by three volumes, " Stories 
of Flemish and Butch Artists " by Mr. Victor 
Reynolds, " Stories of English Artists " by Mr. 
Randall Bavies and Mr. Cecil Hunt, and a new and 
enlarged edition of Mr. T. W. Arnold's translation 
of " The Little Flowers of St. Francis of Assisi." 
These initial volumes present excellent examples of 
book-making, comfortable to the hand as well as 
delightful to the eye. The cover decorations and 
the title-pages are replicas, in one case from a man- 
uscript, in the others from books, of the sixteenth 
century, and arrest attention for their delicate beauty 
of design. The illustrations are many, and are 
reproductions, either in four-color process or in 
black-and-white, of famous paintings. The two art 
books aim to present in easily available form the 
best material from numerous old and bulky his- 
tories — a list of which is carefully given in each 
volume. In quality of text, the "Flowers of St. 
Francis " is wholly different, being a direct trans- 
lation from a pious MS. which records episodes in 
the " seraphic life of St. Francis and his compan- 
ions." The present edition contains, besides numer- 
ous illustrations after Giotto and others, some quaint 
drawings from a fourteenth-century manuscript. 

A book of goodly size, and having a quiet elegance 
of appearance which harmonizes with its subject, is 
Mrs. Lillie Hamilton French's "The House Big- 
nified : Its Besign, Arrangement, and Becoration " 
(Putnam). Seventy-five illustrations show both 
exteriors and interiors of palatial American homes, 
most of them in New York or on I^ong Island, in 
which wealth and good taste have joined to produce 
the best results. The principles which should guide 
the builders of such homes in planning halls and 
stairways, in furnishing salons, dining-rooms, and 
boudoirs, and in selecting fire-places, mirrors, and 
even lamps, are persuasively set forth. Failures in 
such matters are tactfully treated in words only, 
while that which is good is emphasized by photo- 
graphs. Lovers of beautiful and spacious houses 
will find their knowledge and enjoyment increased 
by the volume, while those who are content with 
more humble dwelling places can learn from its 
expert criticism much which they can apply to their 
own uses. 

A picture-book full of precious memories to most 
of us has been made by bringing together all the 
illustrations, eight hundred and sixty-six in number, 
that were drawn for the " Household Edition " 
(1870) of Bickens's works. " Scenes and Char- 
acters from the Works of Charles Bickens " is the 
title of this inviting book, and it is imported by the

THE DIAL. 



[Dec. 16, 



Scribners. The artists contributing to that widely 
popular edition of the then lately deceased novelist's 
works were Fred Barnard, Hablot K. Browne 
( " Phiz "), J. Mahoney, Charles Green, A. B. Frost, 
Gordon Thomson, J. McL. Ralston, H. French, 
E. G. Dalziel, F. A. Fraser, and Sir Luke Fildes. 
Their designs are reprinted " from the original 
wood blocks," and they fill a volume of 584 pages, 
two cuts appearing on a page, for the most part. 
The contrast, combined with a certain general 
resemblance, between the fantastic caricatures of 
" Phiz " and the more humanly possible creations of 
Barnard is most interesting. Barnard, in fact, is the 
leading illustrator of this edition, having supplied 
pictures for eleven of the twenty-five separate works, 
while " Phiz " appears only in " Pickwick," and the 
others in one or in two instances in three works 
each. It would have greatly added to the interest 
of the volume if other early illustrators, especially 
Cruikshank and Seymour, could have been repre- 
sented with " Phiz "; but that was not in the plan. 
The scheme was happily conceived, and has been 
well executed. It is timely too, for there seems to 
be a decided revival of interest, just at present, in 
the work of Dickens. 

Mr. Will Carleton's name carries so definite a 
connotation that it is unnecessary to characterize a 
new volume from his pen. "Drifted In" (Moffat, 
Yard & Co.) is the rhymed narrative of a journey 
on a railroad train, with episodic songs developing 
thoughts by the way. One ballad which will start 
sympathetic vibrations in many hearts is called 
"The Auto and the Saint," and tells how a mule 
who had never been known to kick lost his saint- 
liness at sight of an automobile and kicked it to 
slivers. When the train is stopped by snowdrifts, 
the passengers make their own Decameron by each 
telling a story. These are various in subject, and all 
is as whole-souled in character as the people them- 
selves. A number of them, sucli as "The Merry 
Tennis Girl," " Farmer Stebbins at the Rummage- 
Sale," and "Up-train and Down-train," prove that 
the author's spirit has kept up with the times. 

In "The Henry Hutt Picture Book" (Century 
Co.) seventy -five of Mr. Hutt's best drawings are 
collected from various sources and printed on heavy 
sized paper in a volume of the ordinary picture-book 
dimensions — nine by eleven inches. About half of 
the plates are colored, and they are all extremely 
clever — in no invidious sense of the word. A 
biographical notice of the artist, with portrait, is 
prefixed. The apparent ease and the undeniable 
rapidity with which he has made his way to the 
front, and has become an illustrious illustrator at a 
comparatively early age, is set forth in an interest- 
ing sketch of his professional course. To say that 
the book is almost wholly devoted to the " Henry 
Hutt girl " — a type now nearly as familiar, from 
the pages of " Life," " The Century," " Harper's," 
and other leading periodicals, as was the " Gibson 
girl " a few years ago — wiU sufficiently indicate its 
character. 



Notes. 



The Macmillan Co. publish " Specimens of Exposition 
and Argument," a text-book for the guidance of college 
students, prepared by Messrs. Milton Percival and 
R. A. Jelleffe. 

Lafcadio Ream's translation of "The Crime of 
" Sylvestre Bonnard " forms a new volume in the hand- 
some library edition of the works of M. Anatole France, 
now in course of publication by the John Lane Co. 

" The Redeemed Captive," being an account of the 
experiences of the Rev. John Williams, taken prisoner 
by the Indians at Deerfield in 1704, is now reprinted, 
under the editorship of Mr. George Sheldon, and pub- 
lished as the third issue of the "Indian Captivities 
Series " by the H. R. Hunttmg Co., Springfield, Mass. 
A second volume of piano composition by J. S. Bach, 
edited, like the first, by Mr. Ebenezer Prout, is pub- 
lished by the Oliver Ditson Co. in their "Musicians' 
Library." The volume contains sixteen of Bach's 
larger compositions, including six fugues, three toccatos, 
and two suites. There is an introductory essay, descrip- 
tive of these works, and the usual portrait frontispiece. 
« The Poetical Works of George Crabbe," edited by 
Messrs. A. J. and R. M. Carlyle, are published in an 
" Oxford Edition" by Mr. Henry Frowde. The arrange- 
ment is chronological, and the text is complete, with 
Crabbe's own notes. Six hundred double-columned 
pages of fine print are required for this edition, which 
will probably remam the standard form of the poet for 
many years to come. 

Volume VIII. of the « Proceedings of the Aristotelian 
Society" (N. S.) is sent us by Messrs. Williams & 
Norgate. The papers included are nine in number, and 
one of them, at least, is upon a " live " topic. We refer 
to Mr. G. E. Moore's trenchant analysis of the philoso- 
phy of pragmatism as expounded by Professor James. 
The papers of Messrs. R. B. Haldane, A. Caldecott, and 
Shadworth H. Hodgson are notable, if not exactly lively. 
Two monographs recently published in the Coltunbia 
University series of "Studies in History, Economics, 
and Public Law " are distinguished from their fellows 
by their unusual dimensions, being volumes of five 
hundred and seven hundred pages, respectively. One 
is a study, by Miss Bertha Haven Putnam, of " The 
Enforcement of the Statutes of Laborers (1349-1359)," 
and the other is a history of " The Province of New 
Jersey (1664-1738)," by Dr. Edwin P. Tanner. Both 
bear the imprint of Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 

" Essays and Addresses of Edwin Burritt Smith " is 
the title of a memorial volume now in course of prepar- 
ation by Messrs. George L. Paddock, Albert H. Tolman, 
and Frederick W. Gookin, all intimately associated 
with the man whose life and work are thus sought to be 
perpetuated. The volume will include a memoir and 
a portrait, besides a selection of a score or more of the 
late Mr. Smith's papers on mimicipal government, anti- 
imperiahsm, and other topics. It cannot fail to be a 
work of great interest and value. Subscriptions ($2.50) 
may be sent to Mrs. Edwm Burritt Smith, 5530 Cornell 
Avenue, Chicago. 

Sir Edward Creasy's "Fifteen Decisive Battles of 
the World " has been a minor classic of popular history 
for more than half a century. Scholars have spoken 
kindly of it, although they have taken exceptions to the 
author's choice. Quebec and Yorktown, in particular, 
should have been included among the fifteen. The

anonymous editor of the new issue of the book (Harper) 
has repaired this fault by adding accounts of these 
two battles, and of six others — Vicksburg, Gettysburg, 
Sedan, Manila Bay, Santiago, and Tsu-Shima — fought 
since the middle of the last century. Most of the new 
chapters are signed by names that represent scientific 
scholarship. 

Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co. are the publishers of 
" The Illustrated Bible Dictionary," edited by the Rev. 
William C. Piercy, and making a volume of nearly nine 
hundred pages. The position of the editor is conser- 
vative, and he tells us that he means by conservative 
" that attitude of mind which, while welcoming all ascer- 
tained results of investigation, declines to accept any 
mere conjectures and theories as final conclusions, and 
believes that the Old Testament will emerge with rein- 
forced authority from the ordeal of criticism as the New 
Testament did in the last generation." This should be 
reassuring to timid souls who may hesitate about domes- 
ticating this imposing tome. Besides the very numerous 
illustrations in the text, there are thirty-six full-page 
plates. The Church of England supplies most of the 
contributors, and the list is one to inspire respect. 

John Bell Henneman, M.A. (University of Virginia, 
1884), Ph.D. (University Berlin, 1889), Dean of the 
College of Arts and Sciences, and Professor of English 
Language and Literature in the University of the South, 
Sewanee, Tennessee, since 1900, died suddenly in 
Richmond, Virginia, on the 26th of November. He 
was in his forty-fifth year. For nearly a year he has 
known that he was ill with a fatal disease; and his in- 
dustry, unselfish devotion to his various duties, cheer- 
fulness, and courteous regard for others, have been 
nothing short of heroic. In Professor Henneman's 
work as an educator he probably did more than any 
other man in the history of Southern Education to 
raise the standards of the Southern colleges and uni- 
versities. Two weeks before his death he read a not- 
able paper upon that subject before the Southern 
Association of Schools and Colleges. His contributions 
to literature included his work as Editor of the " Sewanee 
Review" since 1900; his edition (with Prof. W. P. 
Trent) of the complete works of Thackeray; the "Best 
American Tales " ; editions of Shakespeare's " Twelfth 
Night "; Thackeray's " Henry Esmond "; Kemper Bo- 
cock's " The Antiphon to the Stars " ; and as General 
Editor of the Johnson series of English Classics. At the 
time of his death he was the editor of the Literary de- 
partment of " The South in the Building of the Nation," 
issued by the Southern Historical Publication Society.
