ROBERT HERRICK'S New Novel 



A LIFE FOR A LIFE 



"Mr. Herrick writes with the brilliancy and 
fearlessness of a Balzac, and the keenness of 
his analysis is worthy of a study by Ibsen. He 
simply graphically pictures conditions that he 
believes exist to-day in America." From a 
review of his novel " Together." 



"The greatest novel of American life yrt 
written," was the mature verdict upon his 
"Together." As summed up by the Danish 
critic Nielson, " He is one of the few living 
authors whose work really counts, and is to be 
accepted as an authentic representation of life."

A REAL BOOK 

"NATHAN BURKE 

AND NATHAN BURKE is a historical novel, and you long ago made up your mind to read no 
more historical twaddle. YET Kingsley's HYPATIA is a historical novel, so is Churchill's 
THE CRISIS, and you were thankful for them. Hosts of imitators these great books had ; hence 
twaddle and hence your disgust of the historical novel. NATHAN BURKE in its different way is 
as good as either of these great books, and you will be thankful when you discover NATHAN 
BURKE " Thank God for it," as one reviewer irreverently says. 

A historical novel must first of all be interesting, be real, to be of value to you. NATHAN 
BURKE is a real book, and its historical setting only adds to its real charm, its real value. That 
you will also learn something while reading an interesting and agreeable book Is that distasteful 
to you? You will read NATHAN BURKE because of its quality and then, as the reviewers have 
well said, " You will want to read it right over again." 

NATHAN BURKE is a genial, whole-souled, good-natured, real gentleman of the best Ameri- 
can type. You will be glad, more than glad, to know him. He stands well the final best test of 
quality ; you can put yourself in his place and his humanity is of the quality of that of all man- 
kind, " even as you and I." 

If you wish to see NATHAN BURKE, to meet him (between covers), ask to-day at any place 
where books are sold. He will come to be cherished by you, and a lifelong friendship is worth the 
price you will pay the bookseller to make his acquaintance. 



NATHAN BURKE 



By MARY S. WATTS 



The Reviewer, All Believe in NATHAN BURKE; Read What They Say: 



" An exquisitely delightful piece of literature of 
the sort that is not common nowadays. ... A fine 
wholesome and interesting book that is a real novel." 

" An original, unique, and admirable specimen of 
fiction. Rarely has a more profoundly interesting 
novel appeared in America." 

" The acton are folk out of real life, picturesque 
and very human." 



" Hugely interesting," " Extraordinarily worth 
while," "The best novel that has appeared for years," 
" In every sense a notable achievement," " One of 
the big books of this or any year . . . few books 
have been written in yean that will please so much." 

A big, strong, homely, humorous, friendly story 
which holds your interest and is what it is because 
it has for its central figure a real, human, and yet 
noble character."

The last will and testament of Goldwin Smith, 
bequeathing to Cornell University an estate 
amounting to about a million dollars, only adds 
another link to the long chain which during his 
life attached Americans to that great scholar 
and sage counsellor, and which holds him fast in 
our affections now that he is dead. The mag- 
nitude of this gift to American education makes 
it a close second to the benefaction of Cecil 
Rhodes, and again emphatically symbolizes the 
bond of unity between the two great branches 
of our race, a bond that will, we trust, grow ever 
stronger as the years pass. The contribution to 
mutual esteem made by such evidences of the 
close relation between England and America is 
greater than the mere monetary measurement 
can indicate ; the moral significance far exceeds 
the material, for behind the gift we recognize 
the spirit of the giver, and the friendship 
which it denotes is the more precious part of 
the gracious act. 

Goldwin Smith was forty-one years of age 
when, in the summer of 1864, he first came to 
this country. The campaign which was to 
result in Lincoln's reelection was then warming 
up, and our visitor remained until after the 
crisis was past, and the end of the war clearly 
in sight. From oversea he had followed with 
deep interest the epic struggle, and had aligned 
himself with Mill, Bright, and Cobden, when 
he espoused the Union cause in the face of the 
sympathy extended toward the Confederacy by 
the most influential section of English society, 
and even by such political philosophers as 
Gladstone and Acton. He had the clearness of 
vision to perceive that the war in its essence 
was a war against slavery and its intolerably 
arrogant pretensions ; no academic theorizing 
about State rights, no superficial sentimentaliz- 
ing about a brave people rising in defence of 
their liberties, could befog the issue for his keen 
analytical judgment ; and even before he became 
an eye-witness of America in action, he did the 
Federal cause good service by pleading for 
British neutrality with both tongue and pen, 
and by such effective pamphleteering as was 
found in " Does the Bible Sanction American 
Slavery?" and the '* Letter to a Whig Member 
of the Southern Independence Association." 



THE DIAL 



[July 1, 



These were the credentials with which he 
first landed upon our shores, and which earned 
for him a warm welcome during a five months' 
sojourn which took him to the Mississippi and 
to the seat of war. At this time he was no 
more than a sympathetic English student of 
American affairs, deeply interested in the his- 
torical development of our institutions and in 
the reactions of our political crucible. Four 
years later he cast in his lot with America, and 
for the remaining forty-two years of his life was 
a denizen of the New World. The death of his 
father and the breaking up of his home, the 
expiration of his college fellowship and a sense 
of impaired health, were among the causes that 
left him free to make a change in his scheme 
of life ; and he was thinking, he tells us, " of 
settling at Providence, where I should have had 
some special facilities for the study of New 
England history." It was just at this time that 
Mr. Andrew Dickson White had undertaken the 
task of administering the gift of Ezra Cornell, 
and of founding a school in central New York. 
Mr. White was then in Europe, and, learning one 
evening at dinner of Smith's intentions, at once 
sought him out, and persuaded him to accept the 
chair of English history in the new university. 

Thus it was that Cornell gained the most dis- 
tinguished member of its faculty ; and thus it 
was that Gold win Smith, taking up his residence 
in Ithaca in 1868, when the new institution 
opened its doors for students, found himself an 
active worker in a university which had practi- 
cally none of the attributes suggested by the 
Old World connotation of that term. Cornell 
opened with a single building of its own, and 
the use of a huge structure that had been built 
for hydropathic purposes, and was opportunely 
left vacant by the failure of that experiment. 
The university was * land poor," and its equip- 
ment was meagre in the extreme. Smith 
refused to accept any salary for his services, 
and sent to England for his private library in 
order that his students might have the tools 
indispensable for historical work. He also 
brought stone-carvers from England to orna- 
ment the new buildings as they arose, and ivy 
from Oxford for their walls. He had a stone seat 
placed in the campus, and above it inscribed 
the motto, " Above all nations is humanity." 
No wonder that Cornell has ever since held him 
in grateful remembrance as its patron saint. 
His reward was found in the welcome accorded 
him, and in the improvement in health that 
resulted from this pioneer university life, with 
its open-air allurements. 



Three years later, his founder's work for 
Cornell was measurably completed, and he went 
to Toronto, where he established "The Cana- 
dian Monthly." From this time on, he made 
Toronto his home, marrying in 1875, and 
establishing his permanent residence in " The 
Grange," that fine old estate which has been for 
the past thirty-five years a place of pilgrimage 
for English and American scholars. His con- 
nection with Cornell was by no means severed 
by the change of residence, however, and he con- 
tinued, until advancing age made it no longer 
possible, to return to Ithaca every year for a 
course of lectures. As a Canadian, he plunged 
into the thick of the public life of the Dominion, 
and made himself an active force for good in 
politics. His journalistic activities were multi- 
farious and unceasing, he was a frequent speaker 
from the platform, and he was a worker upon 
innumerable boards and commissions affected 
with a public interest. A stout fighter wherever 
fundamental principles were concerned, he made 
enemies as well as friends, and became persona 
non grata to the aristocratic and imperialistic 
elements in Canadian society through his un- 
swerving championship of democracy and his 
persistent advocacy of the opinion that the beat 
interests of Canada were to be furthered by the 
closest possible union with the republic south 
of the border. But if his name came to be 
anathema in tory circles, his arguments re- 
mained unanswered and unanswerable. Econ- 
omic forces always have the last word in political 
discussion. 

There is in Canada, he once said, "a violently 
anti-American party which deems itself the 
patentee of loyalty. . . . The core of this party 
consists of descendants of United Empire Loyal- 
ists, who, partly perhaps because it invests them 
with social interest, devote themselves to blow- 
ing the embers of that feud. But anti-American 
sentiment is hollow, and easily yields to calls of 
interest." He was often called an annexationist 
by his opponents, but himself repudiated the 
word as " something humiliating to Canada." 
Yet his belief remained firm that " continental 
union in a free and honorable way will come. 
It will probably not come in the time of any- 
one as old as I am ; but it will come." " No 
schemes of Imperial Federationists will defeat 
nature, whose forces draw toward union. Race, 
language, literature, religion, political institu- 
tions, social sentiments, and habits are the same 
on both sides of the line ... It may safely bo 
said that the connection of each of the Cana- 
dian provinces with the States to the south of it 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



is stronger than that of the Maritime provinces 
with Ontario, or of French Quebec, with either. 
The populations, in short, are rapidly fusing. 
There will soon be nothing to divide them but 
a political and fiscal line." Such opinions as 
these made the heathen rage in many quarters, 
but it is a vain thing to imagine that nature 
will be thwarted forever in North America by 
any political or social contrivance. 

Goldwin Smith lived and died in the best 
sense a friend of our own country. He was 
not blind to the evils with which we have to 
contend, and thus enumerated some of the 
worst of them : " The negro difficulty, the spread 
of lawlessness, the weakness of American states- 
manship and government, the municipal cor- 
ruption, the pension list, but, above all, the 
renunciation of the fundamental principles of 
the American commonwealth, consequent on the 
annexation of the Philippines, and the entan- 
glement of the American Department of State 
with the un-American councils and designs of 
European powers." This is a list to give the 
most patriotic of us pause ; and it might be con- 
siderably extended. But in pointing out such 
failings, a friend like Goldwin Smith proves 
himself most faithful, and the fact that, seeing 
all these evil things, and many others, he could 
still believe that the soul of good in our nation 
would ultimately triumph, offers the best possible 
evidence of the depth of his attachment. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THEODORE PARKER AS A POLITICAL PHILOSO- 
PHER was the theme of Mr. Frank B. Sanborn's 
centennial address on his old-time friend at the 
recent celebration held at West Roxbury. " I choose 
for my topic to-day, ' Parker the Political Philoso- 
pher,' " said Mr. Sanborn, " and I point to Abraham 
Lincoln and the emancipation of millions of negro 
slaves as the result of his philosophy in its steady and 
natural development." To call Abraham Lincoln 
the result of anybody's philosophy, even of Theo- 
dore Parker's, is, to put it mildly, a slight misplac- 
ing of emphasis. Lincoln had a plenty of philosophy 
and of philanthropy of his own, even though we like 
to recall his undoubted debt to the New England 
free-thinker, whom he greatly admired. u The 
doctrine of Jefferson and of Abraham Lincoln a 
theory of government of the people, by the people, 
and for the good of the people was not," declared 
the speaker, " the original invention of any of these 
men ; but Parker did more to formulate it than any 
American, until Abraham Lincoln, after Parker's 
death, took up his testimony in the same behalf." 



And later he said, in a somewhat different connec- 
tion : " I have some right to speak on this point, for 
I was perhaps more intimate with Parker in his 
last four years than any of his other political friends. 
I was in his confidence ; introduced John Brown 
to his acquaintance in 1857, brought them together 
again in March, 1858, and had their correspondence 
pass through my hands in the years of the Virginia 
conspiracy. Parker was one of the few men in 
America who ventured to predict the downfall of 
slavery in the nineteenth century, though he did 
not see how rapid would be its destruction after 
Lincoln came to the height of political power." 



THE ENDLESS EVOLUTION OF THE WORK OF 

FICTION, from folk-tale and epic lay to the modern 
prose romance and the (sometimes prosy) essay in 
psychological analysis, is a thing to contemplate with 
wonder and with all sorts of interesting conjecture 
and speculation as to the shape and character of the 
twenty-fifth-century or the thirtieth-century novel. 
A questionnaire lately sent out to authors and critics 
by the London " Book Monthly " elicited various 
kinds of answers as to " the chief changes in the 
English-written novel within recent years," and as to 
the upward or downward tendency of these changes 
in respect to " human interest and literary quality." 
The replies, so far as published, indicate consider- 
able difference of opinion, but leave us by no means 
in despair of the modern novel. The decay of sen- 
timent, or of kid-glove sentimentality, is noted, and 
the rise of realism and of cool and critical analysis. 
Of Messrs. Wells and Galsworthy one reply says : 
" They are painting life as it is. The old school of 
amorists and glamorists is dead. The defect of the 
new school is that it lacks imagination and humour. 
It is photographically hard and harsh and brutal, 
like the daily paper snapshots. But sooner or later 
it will throw up a man of a genius who can fuse 
sympathy with sincerity and tenderness with truth." 
This fusion is not so very hard to find even now, 
but there is always the delightful possibility of still 
greater triumphs of genius in any and every quality 
that makes for excellence. 



THE COLLEGE STUDENT OF A CENTURY AGO would 

seem a queer creature to the typical collegian of 
to-day. Instead of a maximum of athletics and a 
minimum of study, the Harvard or Yale or Prince- 
ton youth of 1810 was nurtured on copious draughts 
of learning, of an undeniably bookish sort, and a 
very meagre or altogether wanting dose of physical 
culture. In some century-old letters written by one 
Stephen Salisbury, Harvard student, to his parents 
in Worcester, and lately unearthed for the purposes 
of a paper read before the American Antiquarian 
Society, there are revealed some curious customs of 
the collegians of that day. Culture was valued at 
its true worth by young Salisbury's father, who 
counselled his son to regard his studies not as a 
task, but as an entertainment. His mother advised

him to exercise with the skipping-rope in his room 
when hindered by rain from taking his customary 
walk or ride, and she also felt obliged to refuse his 
request for curtains to his windows, as an extrava- 
gance. Both father and mother exercised a super- 
vision over their son's dress and diet and behavior, 
and even prescribed the times and seasons for having 
his hair cut. But of course the Harvard student of 
that day was much younger than the average col- 
legian of our time. The " liberal education " of a 
century ago was imparted at Cambridge by a faculty 
of thirteen professors and four tutors, and the whole 
body of undergraduates was smaller than the present- 
day corps of instructors. 



A MUNICIPAL BLUNDER AND A LOST LIBRARY 

form the theme of an interesting true story. The 
late Judge John Handley, proprietor of the Wyoming 
Hotel in Scranton, Pa., cherished kindly feelings 
toward his city and intended to leave it the bulk of 
his large estate. But when the city council, against 
his advice and wishes, permitted the location of cer- 
tain unsightly stock-yards in front of his hotel, the 
Judge changed his mind. A visit at about this time 
to Winchester, Va., to view certain historic battle- 
fields, aroused his interest in that city; and when 
the time came, soon afterward, for him to pay the 
debt to Nature, it was Winchester and not Scranton 
that profited by his benevolence to the extent of more 
than a million dollars, including a quarter-million- 
dollar library building, the finest structure of the 
kind in the South erected by one man. The recent 
completion of this handsome monument to Judge 
Handley 's memory shows it to be in the French 
Renaissance style, executed in a buff shade of 
Indiana limestone, with terra cotta roofing and a 
noble dome sheathed in copper a fireproof building 
throughout. As soon as funds are available for the 
purpose, the interior equipment will be completed, 
the bookshelves stocked, the successful applicants for 
positions in this palace of literature will be placed in 
charge of its treasures, and the Handley Memorial 
Library will take its place on the firing line against 
the forces of ignorance and materialism and low 
ideals and sordid interests. 



THE PERSISTENCE OF A MINOR ANGLICISM that 

seems to be growing in favor, in defiance of gram- 
mar and logic, claims a word of comment. In the 
letter of an English correspondent at Rome we note 
three occurrences of the peculiar idiom within a 
space of fourteen lines. The letter has to do with 
a certain distinguished American traveller, of whom 
we read : " . . . two keen, blue eyes, now wide open 
behind the gold pince-nez, are looking searchingly 
into yours, as though the owner is weighing your 
worth in a single glance. Then he talks. His voice 
is a little hoarse ... as though he is addressing a 
public meeting. . . . The muscles of his face con- 
tract and relax and contract again as though he is in 
acute pain." Three instances we have here of " as 



though" (which, by the way, were better a.s if") 
introducing a supposition contrary to fact and fol- 
lowed by the indicative, the mood of positive asser- 
tion. "As though he were" (or, better, "as if he 
were ") would be used, and correctly usi-l, l.v ninety- 
nine out of every hundred American writers, and not 
improbably by the hundredth writer also. What is 
the peculiar construction of the English ear, that it 
should not feel the jar of this solecism ? 



THE CIRCULATION OF HUMANE LITERATURE 18 

becoming a prominent factor in the general move- 
ment for the better treatment of animals. The 
American Humane Education Society, the pioneer 
organization in this important work, has developed 
a plan for sending out travelling libraries through 
our rural districts, the books to be circulated chiefly 
under the direction of local school boards, ami with 
no charge to readers. Thirty books have been 
chosen by a committee composed of Dr. Francis H. 
Rowley, of Boston, the society's president ; Dr. 
Albert Leffingwell of New York ; Miss Sarah J. 
Eddy of Rhode Island ; and Mrs. Mary F. Lowell 
of Pennsylvania. In the list are such popular favor- 
ites as u Rab and his Friends," by Dr. John Brown, 
" Jonathan and David," by Mrs. Eliza)>eth Stuart 
Phelps Ward, " Little Brother to the Bear," by I >r. 
William J. Long, " A Boy I Knew," by Laurence 
Hutton, " Wild Animals I have Known," by Mr. 
Ernest Thompson Seton. The movement is a good 
one, and if systematically followed up can hardly 
fail of a wholesome effect upon the younger genera- 
tion. . . . 

THE EXHILARATING TILT OF THE LITERARY 

FREE-LANCE is surely, thinks the novice, a pleasant 
and a pulse-quickening exercise. In a volume entitled 
" Vocations for the Trained Woman," published by 
the Women's Educational and Industrial Union of 
Boston, occurs this alluring passage : " It may be 
said in general that it is a comparatively easy thing 
for a very ordinary writer, with very ordinary indus- 
try, to make $1,000 a year f ree- lancing in New York. 
It is a very easy and a very speedy matter to write 
a thousand words. It is not a matter of time or 
difficulty to get the material to fill a thousand words. 
The crux of the matter comes in knowing what sort 
of material to get, how to get it. and where to sell 
it" Let us hope this little "crux" will not be over- 
looked by any young woman tempted to resign a 
thousand-dollar teachership or other assured posi- 
tion, however irksome, and to hasten to New York 
to swell the already o'erburdened ranks of actual or 
would-be free-lance journalists. 


THE UNPOETIC APPEARANCE OF SOME POETS is a 

thing to try one's faith in Lavater. While Chaucer 
and Suckling and Byron, and Longfellow and Lowell 
and Emerson, with many another that might be 
named, had the stamp and bearing of poets, Ben 
Jonson and Herrirk and Goldsmith and the trooper 
Coleridge and even the gentle Wordsworth would

hardly have been singled out from a crowd as 
builders of the lofty rhyme. And now it is pretty 
well established that M. Maeterlinck, poet, mystic, 
and dreamer, apostle of much that is daintily deli- 
cate and subtly suggestive in thought and expression, 
is in his outward person a hearty, strapping, broad- 
shouldered, robustly healthy sort of man, who might 
pass for nothing more than a stolid, beef-eating, 
ale-drinking country gentleman, devoted to the care 
of his estates and the maintenance of the established 
order. And we learn, not with displeasure, that he 
is fond of working in his garden with a coarse apron 
tied about his generous waist and an old felt hat on 
his head. 



A THACKERAY CLUB IN AMERICA, affiliated with 
the English association of like name, is proposed as 
appropriate to the Thackeray centennial next year. 
The Titmarsh Club in London will, it is expected, 
take the lead in honoring Thackeray's memory, and 
then or earlier would be a good time to organize here 
a similar literary and dining society, expert in the 
post-prandial quotation of choice bits of Thackeray 
wit and wisdom, and devoted, gastronomically, to 
the dishes and wines known to have been the great 
novelist's favorites or found to be most frequently 
mentioned in his works. Such a club would be some- 
thing of a novelty with us. We have our serious 
Shakespeare societies and our Browning societies 
and our literary associations of various sorts, but of 
convivial Omar Khayyam clubs and Johnson clubs 
and Pepys clubs there is yet a lack. Why not, 
also, form a club to lead in the expected Dickens 
demonstration of two years hence, and call it the 
Pickwick Club ? A new set of " Pickwick Papers" 
would be the natural literary manifestation of its 
jovial existence. 



COMM UN 1C A TIONS. 



A WORD ABOUT THE THEATRE. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

" To make us pity his characters when they are vile 
or love them when they are noxious, to invent excuses 
for them in situations when they cannot be excused, 
in a word, to lie about his characters, this is for the 
dramatist the one unpardonable sin. To it must be 
added a second, almost equally great to allure the 
audience to generalize falsely in regard to life at large, 
from the specific circumstances of his play." 

These wise words were printed in THE DIAL of 
June 16. I wish they might be inscribed in large letters 
above every stage. On the page before, however, the 
same writer repeats a common saying, that "there is 
no such thing per se as an immoral subject for a play"; 
and here I must dissent. Yesterday I saw Mrs. Fiske 
play " Becky Sharp " in Denver. She acted, I thought, 
with consummate skill. The piece is " orthodox " 
enough, taken straight out of " classic " fiction, and the 
house was filled with young and old, men and women, 
who seemed to approve. Nevertheless, were I the only 
living person who thought it, I should maintain that the 
play in general, and some of its situations in particular, 



are absolutely offensive. I have never seen " Monna 
Vanna " on the stage, but am heartily in accord with 
the English authorities who excluded it therefrom. 
We are sometimes told about the high moral purpose 
of such productions; I do not believe that they have 
any. We are told that it is necessary to know all 
phases of life. It is necessary for the chemist to know 
a certain ill-smelling phosphorus compound ; but even 
his brother chemists would be outraged if he called 
them together for entertainment and then turned loose 
a quantity of this substance. 

The opinion I have expressed may be that of a small 
and relatively insignificant minority. Nevertheless it 
may be worth expressing. Regard it, if you like, as a 
matter of psychology. I go to see Maude Adams in 
" Peter Pan " and What Every Woman Knows," and 
come away delighted; I go to see Mrs. Fiske, and in 
spite of her great skill am disgusted and depressed. Is 
it not possible that the nawe reactions of one who is no 
expert in the drama have a certain meaning and value ?

THE INACCURACY OF "SUFFRAGETTE." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of June 16 occurs an article by Mr. 
Paul Shorey, entitled " Mill Revealed in His Letters." 
On page 418 this writer allows himself to be betrayed 
into the inaccuracy of using the term " suffragette " 
with reference to the woman's movement of Mill's day. 
This should not be suffered to pass without a protest. 
The term, belittling and derisive in its origin and philo- 
logical connotation, is an unfortunate neologism of 
Hooligan antecedents, and has no application to any 
person of Mill's time, nor to the majority of the advo- 
cates of woman suffrage to-day. It is an expression 
which was hurled by London rowdies at Mrs. Pankhurst 
and her group of so-called " millitant suffragists " in 
England, and belongs to no others whatsoever. That 
this militant group, in a spirit of bravado, chose to 
accept a title insultingly applied to them, does not bind 
other woman suffragists. The movement in behalf of 
a full recognition of civil and political equality between 
men and women is as serious and free from hysteria 
as any other of the political movements of our day, 
and is entitled to the same decency in methods of con- 
troversy. " Suffragette," as a general term for women 
who are identified with this movement, is as inaccurate 
as it is unwarranted. JAMES F. MORTON, JR.

THE CULT OF ILLITERACY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In my room at a summer resort In California I found 
tacked upon the wall a card bearing this inspiring motto: 
" Let every noble thot in yu have expression." In such 
fashion is illiteracy tot by those who have cot the mania 
for "reform " in spelling. One of the first words that 
succumbed out here was " programme." Close upon the 
heels of its abbreviation in print came its abbreviation 
in pronunciation. "Progrum "now prevails, "mono- 
grum " is making headway in the smart stationery shops, 
and "telegrum " may often be heard. But what is the use 
of argument or protest? De gustibus non disputandum 
seems the only refuge. W A B

THE L.IFE OP A STRENUOUS PEACE.M \ K i i :.* 

" A pugnacious pacificist " was the phrase 
sometimes applied to Sir Randal Cremer, the 
life-long laborer in the cause of international 
peace whose lamented death in 1908 has been 
followed now by a careful summary of his pub- 
lic services from the pen of his old friend and 
associate, Mr. Howard Evans. " Sir Randal 
Cremer: His Life and Work" presents, in three 
hundred and fifty pages, an enviable record of 
good works in many departments of philanthropy, 
but especially in those that relate to the pro- 
motion of harmony in the transaction of the 
world's affairs. That he was, however, by no 
means a man of one idea is plain from the wide 
range of public questions to which he turned 
his attention, compulsory and free education, 
public libraries, commons preservation, registra- 
tion reform, taxation of ground values, nation- 
alization of the land, religious equality, the right 
of free speech, the deliverance of trade unions 
from judge-made law, the protection of weaker 
races, and the emancipation of oppressed peo- 
ples. But it is, of course, as the founder and 
for many years the head of the International 
Arbitration League that Cremer will be best 
remembered. 

From the ranks of the lowly and oppressed, 
as might have been expected, this champion of 
the cause of right against might fought his way 
upward. From an early page of the biography 
we copy the following : 

Cremer once gave the House of Commons some 
graphic reminiscences of the home of poverty in which 
he was brought up, when he opposed the proposal of Sir 
Michael Hicks-Beach to levy a shilling duty on corn. 
He said that when his mother, who kept a dame school, 
had only five or six shillings a week on which to keep 
herself, him, and his two sisters, a two-pound loaf cost 
eightpence. For breakfast the children had three thin 
slices of bread with a very thin scraping of butter, and 
a cup of weak tea without milk or sugar. Dinner con- 
sisted of boiled duff flour and water stewed together 
and boiled like a pudding with potatoes, and perhaps 
once a week an ounce or two of meat. The tea was like 
the breakfast, and usually the children had to go to bed 
without supper, hungry as wolves." 

The eighty years of Cremer's life were so 
largely filled with public and philanthropic 
labors that it is difficult to think of him as hav- 
ing any private and domestic life of his own. 
Hi- school education was of the most rudimen- 
tary kind, cut short by the necessity of earning

his bread, his father having deserted wife and 
family in the boy's infancy. He became a buil< let- 
by trade, and was twice married, though it does 
not apjM'ar that he allowed himself many minutes 
out of the day for the enjoyment of his home. 
In fact, we read of him : 

" Few political men have lived so lonely a life as 
Cremer in his later years. His large office was in reality 
his sleeping chamber. At the back of a book-case was 
a turn-down bed, which apparently he made himself ; a 
small gas-stove enabled him to prepare his own break- 
fast. For the rest of the day he obtained his meals at 
the House of Commons or elsewhere. This, however, 
was by no means an unpleasant hermitage. I.inc..ln'> 
Inn Fields is a veritable rtu in nrbe. The rich foliage 
of the extensive gardens altogether hid the houses on 
the opposite side of the square. Only from his third 
floor front was it possible to get a glimpse of the dome 
of St. Paul's, and the graceful fieche of the Law Courts 
in the Strand." 

Though he failed to secure a seat in Parlia- 
ment until he was fifty-seven years old, he had 
from early manhood been interested in public 
questions and had early conceived the project 
of international arbitration as a means of adjust- 
ing international differences. In some scanty 
notes on his personal history, Cremer himself 
has written, referring to the time of his young 
manhood : 

" One evening there was a lecture on ' Peace,' prob- 
ably given by a lecturer of the original Peace Society. 
The speaker advocated the settlement of international 
disputes by peaceful means instead of war. I listened 
with rapt attention, and next day I discussed the matter 
with two or three shop-mates who had been present. 
They pooh-poohed the idea, and declared that the world 
had always settled its disputes by force and would con- 
tinue to do so. That lecture sowed the seed of Inter- 
national Arbitration in my mind, though the word 
arbitration ' had hardly been heard." 

Soon after the young apprentice had listened 
to that lecture, which seems to have been an 
epoch-making event in his life, he took up his 
residence in Brighton, where he joined a work- 
men's institute in which Frederick Robertson, 
the eloquent Brighton preacher, was warmly 
interested, and he frequently attended Robert- 
son's church. At Brighton it was, too, that he 
made his first political speech, on the occasion of 
a parliamentary election. In 1852 he removed 
to London, where he soon became active in the 
cause of shorter hours for labor an activity 
that lost him his position, but did not prevent 
his securing another. 

It was in 1870, when England and the world 
were stirred by the outbreak of war between 
France and Germany, that Creraer formed his 
Workmen's Peace Committee which afterward 
developed into the International Arbitration 
League. Its first important work was the draft-

ing of an " Outline of a Plan for the Establish- 
ment of a High Court of Nations," which largely 
anticipated the work of the Hague Conference. 
Of Cremer's self-imposed missions to various 
countries in the cause of universal peace, of his 
three visits to Washington, and of his life-long 
zeal and industry in the work to which he had 
put his hand, Mr. Evans's pages give a detailed 
account and are likely to find many appreciative 
readers at this time. Concerning the peace 
party's attitude toward the Boer War, the fol- 
lowing from our author's pen is of interest. 

" Throughout Europe the British people were re- 
garded as a nation of sanctimonious hypocrites. At that 
time a Briton travelling abroad found it desirable to 
hide his origin as far as he could, which was not always 
easy. With the solitary exception of Yves Guyot, no 
man in all France whose opinion was worth having had 
a word to say in our favour. One of my most bitter 
recollections is that in Geneva, that ancient fastness of 
freedom, I sat in the English Garden, on an Easter holi- 
day, watching a grand procession of the trades, and was 
suddenly confronted with the collection-box in aid of the 
Boer women and children. I gave my contribution with 
tears of shame. For the men whose pride and obstinacy 
brought us to such humiliation there can be no forgive- 
ness, for they trailed the fair fame of our own dear land 
in the dust before all Europe at the instigation of 
polyglot devotees of Mammon, who had degraded and 
debauched the Press alike in England and South Africa. 
The British nation which went trafficking in the crisis 
of the war fever has since learned by bitter experience 
that it cannot make war on the cheap, and to this day 
it is suffering from the consequences of its folly." 

The award of the Nobel Peace Prize to 
Cremer in 1903, and his bestowal of it upon 
the Arbitration League as an endowment fund, 
are matters of recent history. His hesitating 
acceptance of the knighthood twice offered him 
by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, in the lat- 
ter's term as prime minister, was a sign on Cre- 
mer's part that, though he doubted the propriety 
of all such titular distinctions, he appreciated 
the offer as an indirect recognition, in the highest 
quarters, of the value of the work accomplished 
by the advocates of peace. Rather surprising 
to many, in view of woman's influence in the 
cause he had most at heart, was his vehement 
opposition to woman suffrage. He even issued 
a tract, entitled " Shall Men or Women Rule the 
World," which gave thirty- three reasons why 
women should not vote ; and in another called 
" Some of the Legal Privileges of Women " he 
argued that, instead of being treated unjustly 
by the laws of the land, English women enjoyed 
certain important legal rights and immunities 
denied to men. Another characteristic aversion 
of his was, as his biographer tells us, " his dislike 
to the tip system by which waiters were paid, 
which he regarded as degrading and demoralizing 



to the recipients. Of course, he did not object 
to a fair wage for any class of men, but he held 
that the employer should pay his own servants. 
More than once when arranging a social function 
he stipulated for the payment of a fixed sum to 
waiters, and nothing roused his resentment more 
than to find the men who had been thus paid 
already cadging for further payment by the 
guests." 

Mr. Evans's long association with Cremer 
he has been chairman of the Council of the Arbi- 
tration League since 1877 makes him the best 
possible historian of his friend's public services. 
The book, published for the International School 
of Peace, is well calculated to further its cause. 
A good portrait of Cremer, and other illustra- 
tions, are to be found within its covers.

THE NAVAL, CONQUEST OF CANADA.* 

Since its organization, three or four years 
ago, the Chainplain Society of Toronto has fully 
justified its existence. Its publications re- 
prints and original documents have come 
out more slowly than was anticipated ; but 
this has not been an unmixed evil, as it has 
made for fuller and more careful editorial treat- 
ment. The Society has so far been most for- 
tunate in the men selected to edit its volumes, 
and never more so than in its latest publication. 
No one could have been found better equipped 
to edit the " Logs of the Conquest of Canada " 
than the author of " The Fight for Canada." 
Colonel Wood admirably combines a clear, crisp, 
and attractive style with scholarly balance and 
clear-headedness, and a genius for extracting 
marrow from the most unpromising bones of 
history. This genius was never more happily 
applied than in the present case, for, as he 
justly says, " nothing is drier than a ship's log ; 
not even Statutes at Large or the Anglo-Saxon 
Chronicle." That these logs have been made 
to yield an attractive as well as most valuable 
story of the naval side of the campaigns in 
Canada, is no mean tribute to the skill of the 
author. 

The book is divided into two equal parts, the 
latter consisting of selections from the logs of 
His Majesty's ships in the Louisburg, Quebec, 
and Montreal campaigns of 1758, 1759, and 
1760 ; and the former of editorial equipment, 
embracing a very full introduction, bibliog-

raphy, and cartography. Three charts, and a 
plan to illustrate the logs, are placed in a 
pocket at the end of the volume. 

Why, asks Colonel Wood, is it worth while, 
and very well worth while, to edit a selection 
from the logs of the ships engaged in the cam- 
paigns that determined the British conquest of 
Canada ? And he gives this answer : 

" These logs are the simplest and least self-conscious 
of all records; because they are the record of the Navy's 
work there; because the fleets were relatively stronger 
forces than the armies; because, in addition to their own 
work, they gave their armies enormous advantages over 
the enemy in every detail of ordnance, commissariat, 
transport, mobility, scouting, and military intelligence; 
because, as all the seas in the world are interdependent, 
every squadron of the British Navy was an integral part 
of the single overwhelming force which was then the 
prime deciding factor in the greatest of all imperial 
wan waged for oversea dominion; and, finally, because 
the public, and the Canadian public in particular, have 
not yet found out the one true point of view. They all 
admit that the conquest was effected by the joint forces 
of the United Service, and not by either the Army or 
Navy alone. But the stock saying, that Wolfe was 

supported by a fleet,' completely inverts the nature 
and functions of the two constituent parts of this United 
Service. What really happened was that Saunders, 
whose great fleet was working out one phase of a world- 
wide amphibious war, was supported by Wolfe, whose 
small army was used as a local landing party at Quebec." 

The primary object of Colonel Wood's 
scholarly Introduction is, therefore, to establish 
his contention that the conquest of Canada was 
the work of the army and the navy in coopera- 
tion, and that the dominating force was the fleet. 
To this argument he brings an imposing array of 
proof, and incidentally affords us many graphic 
pictures of life on board His Majesty's ships of 
war in the middle of the eighteenth century. 
Men were recruited by " pressing " and by 
"presting." Pressing was taking a man whether 
he liked it or not ; presting was giving him a 
shilling as a " prest," by accepting which he 
bound himself to be " prest " or " ready " to 
serve. The press-gang, under an officer, attended 
to both forms of recruiting. Sanitation on board 
ship was almost unknown. An official return of 
the period gives the following startling results : 
Of 184,893 seamen and marines employed dur- 
ing the war, 1512 were killed in action or by 
accident, and 133,708 died by sickness or were 
missing! There was, as Colonel Wood says, 
"nothing new in the sickness and discomfort 
induced by bilge-water. The oldest genuine sea- 
song known in the English tongue describes 
exactly what happened during the Canadian 
campaigns on board ships whose logs contained 
no entries of 4 Employed starting salt water,' or 

* Ventulater keept working.' 



' A sak of strawe were there ryght good, 
For some must lyg them in theyr hood; 
I had as lefe be in the wood, 
Without or meat or drynk: 

For when that we shall go to bedde, 
The pumpe was nygh our beddes hede; 
A man were as good be ded, 
As smell thereof the stynk.' 

The strange thing is that when ships and crews 
were so manifestly better with a clean bilge, 
boiled drinking-water, and a working ventilator, 
such simple precautions were so much neglected." 

The following account of the " fore-bitter " 
(corresponding to the sing-song of the present 
day) will be of general interest. 

" The singer took his stand on the fore-bitts, which 
were massive ends of timber, rising to a convenient 
height from the deck close to the fore-mast He had 
no instrumental accompaniment. He sang his hatchet- 
made verses to monotonous airs, and he nearly always 
wound up with a rather obvious moral. But he and his 
audience knew nothing of self-conscious pose. Singer, 
song, and audience were all intent on the direct expres- 
sion of a seaman's idea of his own life, its dangers and 
troubles, its aspiration and achievement, and its ideal of 
a home. Dibdin's songs, of course, were never popular at 
sea (as Kipling's have never been in the army); though 
they have taught innumerable landsmen more tilings in 
heaven and earth than were dreamt of in the seaman's 
own philosophy. The really popular airs and verses were, 
like all other folklore, the variants of compositions by 
unknown singers, who received and handed down by oral 
tradition whatever best suited them and their audience." 

One more quotation, from a letter written in 
1756 by a naval officer to a young cousin about 
to enter the service, is eloquent of the condi- 
tions which gently-nurtured midshipmen had to 
face a century and a half ago. 

" Your light for day and night is a small candle, 
which is often stuck at the side of your platter for 
meals, for want of a better convenience. Your victuals 
are salt and often bad ; and if you would vary the mode 
of dressing them you must cook yourself. I would 
recommend you always to have tea and sugar; the rest 
you must trust to, for you'll scarce find room for any 
more than your chest and hammock, and the latter at 
times you must carry upon deck to defend you from 
small shot, unless you keep one of the sailors in fee 
with a little brandy. Low company is the bane of all 
young men; but in a man-of-war you have the collected 
filth of jails. . . . You will find some little outward 
appearance of religion . . . and Sunday prayers, but 
the congregation is generally drove together by the 
boatswain, who neither spares oaths nor blows." 

Altogether, these " Logs of the Conquest of 
Canada," with the double light they throw on 
the operations of the fleet at Louisburg, Quebec, 
and Montreal, on the one hand, and on the his- 
tory, character, and personnel of tin- navy, on 
the other, form a most important contrilmtimi 
to American historical literature.

GOING TO THE ANT.* 

High-water mark in American biological 
scholarship has certainly been attained in Pro- 
fessor William Morton Wheeler's extensive and 
scholarly work upon "Ants, their Structure, 
Development, and Behavior" (The Columbia 
University Press), the result of a decade of 
uninterrupted study of these most interesting 
of all the so-called lower forms of life. The 
voluminous world-literature of the subject the 
extent of which may be judged by the fact that 
the author lists seventy pages of titles has 
also been ransacked to bring together all avail- 
able information supplementary to the author's 
own intensive and thoroughgoing investigations. 

The work appeals to a wide range of readers. 
The zoologists and entomologists will find all of 
its pages replete with learning, and invaluable as 
an authoritative source of trustworthy informa- 
tion on all phases of myrmecology. The general 
reader interested in natural science will discover 
that the larger part of the book is devoted to sub- 
jects of unusual interest, written with clearness 
and remarkable freedom from special pleading 
for pet evolutionary hypotheses or bias toward 
unproved theories, and from sensationalism. 
While it is strictly scientific in its search for the 
truth, the reader cannot fail to be infected by 
the author's warm enthusiasm for his subject. 
The ants are a dominant group among insects, 
as a result of their unusual variability, wide 
distribution, numerical ascendency, longevity, 
abandonment of detrimental specialization, and 
great versatility in their relations to plants and 
other animals. They exhibit a high degree of 
social organization, based upon a remarkable 
structural and functional differentiation among 
the members of the colony. They thus exhibit, 
among still existing types of colonies, many 
phases in the probable course of evolution of the 
complicated polymorphisms and unique diversi- 
ties of instinct. The author discusses, among 
other interesting topics, the development of ants 
and the remarkable maternal instincts found in 
queens and workers, the light thrown upon the 
past history of ants by forms found fossil in 
amber, and the structure and construction of 
ants' nests. Other chapters are devoted to those 
rare and primitive groups of ants which repre- 
sent the oldest existing expression of social life, 
the stage in which to use Maeterlinck's 
words we have passed from the " precarious 
and incomplete egoistic to a social life with its

slight accession of certainty and happiness"; 
with the more complicated habits and specialized 
instincts of the driver and legionary ants, of the 
harvesting ants, and of those which grow subter- 
ranean fungus gardens, attend herds and flocks 
of plant-lice, scale insects, tree-hoppers and 
caterpillars, and mayhap store for the time their 
garnered dairy products in certain " replete " 
members of the colony ; with the slave-makers 
and amazons, and the more degenerate slavers 
and permanent social parasites. 

The philoprogenitive instincts and social 
habits of ants have made possible intimate rela- 
tions between themselves and other animals, 
resulting in a perplexing assemblage of assasins, 
scavengers, satellites, guests, commensals, and 
parasites, which are found in their nests. In- 
deed, nearly four hundred species of beetles 
and other insects are amicably treated, licked, 
fondled, fed, and even reared, by ants ! The 
instincts of ants form a fascinating subject for 
the naturalist, the physiologist, the psychologist, 
and surely also for the sociologist of biological 
sympathies. This subject is treated at length 
from an objective standpoint. The encyclopaedic 
nature of the work is enhanced by appendices 
dealing with the methods of collecting ants and 
of keeping them under observation in formi- 
caries. A key to the genera and sub-genera of 
North American ants, and a list of described 
North American species, with their distribution, 
are also given. Practical methods of extermin- 
ating noxious ants are also discussed. The work 
is authoritative, encyclopaedic, intensely interest- 
ing to the biologist and naturalist, and exception- 
ally attractive to all who are interested in natural 
history. CHARLES ATWOOD KOFOID. 



THE FIELD OF FICTION.* 

To those who find in fiction the most signifi- 
cant reflection of contemporaneous life and its 
most important literary product, a survey of the 
origin and development of its types, and of the 
work of writers of the past as well as of the 
present, possesses abiding interest.

in big account of " The Short Story in English," 
traee- tin- progress <>( this type through tin- his- 
tory of its changing fashions, beginning with the 
religious tales of Anglo-Saxon times and con- 
tinuing through the products of the centuries, 
moulded by various influences, to the result of 
these shaping forces seen in " the powerful en- 
gine for the expression of life " the extremely 
technicalized short story of to-day. The stages 
in this development are interestingly marked. 
The Roman Church influence is succeeded by 
the influence of mediaeval France, with its fab- 
liaux, lais, and contes devots. Then Chaucer, 
renascent Italy, and France, in a new wave of 
tendency, exert their sway. The English essay- 
ists next take a hand in the shaping of the form, 
until writers in the sweep of the romantic move- 
ment prepare the way for Poe the first indi- 
vidual of commanding importance in the history 
of short-story writing. After Poe, the emphasis 
on technique, though intensifying the effect, 
artificializes the form, as is well recognized in 
the typical work of the day. What the present 
tendencies are, and what the future will bring 
forth, seem not too difficult to judge. 

" Our modern short story began as technique for a 
worthy effect. In lesser hands, at least, it is degenerat- 
ing into a technique whose effect is merely technical. 
The specific word, the rapid introduction, the stressed 
climax, the careful focus and the studied tone, are too 
often the masters, not the servants, of the story. Facil- 
ity is widespread, artificiality rampant. Scores of well- 
known short-story writers prepare to ascend their little 
peaklet of narrative accoutered like Tartarin in his 
Alpine regalia, equipped not for their Rigi but Mont 
Blanc. In so recent a collection as ' Plain Tales from 
the Hill.-,' the effort is already as patent as the success. 
When our tastes are a little more jaded by the nervous 
endeavor of the modern short-story, many and many a 
successful tale will seem as false in taste as the vapidities 
of the Euphuists. A less labored story must come back. 
The movement will be towards the ideal of Chaucer and 
away from the strenuosity of Poe." 

It is a far cry, in Professor Canby's narrative, 
from Aelfric to " O. Henry." A wide gap of 
centuries has to be spanned. It is no easy task 
to pioneer in the detailed and careful tracing of 
his type through such a period, and the writer in 
several instances lays himself open to criticism : 
but he has dared and done, and done well. He 
has written seriously yet interestingly of our 
most significant modern literary type and of its 
development from its origins ; and he has accom- 
plished a praiseworthy feat in linking its vital 
present with its instructive past. 

Like Professor Canby, Miss Clara Whitmore 
has devoted herself to the study of a special class 
of fiction. He, however, interests us chiefly by 
tracing the evolution of a type; she, by the 



endeavor in empliasi/e a <vrtain point of view. 
Many women writers have sunk into an oblivion 
from which, she claims, their intrinsic merit 
should have preserved them : and she believes 
this misfortune due to the fact that most books 
on literature have been written from the man's 
standpoint. Her book has been written from the 
woman's point of view. To portray women writ- 
ers, and women's and the woman's outlook upon 
life and its interpretation, is her aim. Just 
what the feminine viewpoint is, however, seems 
as difficult to state definitely in a treatise on 
fiction as in a study of life. The task, perhaps, 
belongs more properly to the psychologist than 
to the literary historian ; and our author for 
the most part leaves it to the psychologist or 
to someone else, and in this respect piques 
without satisfying our interest. Once or twice 
she comes boldly out to emphasize certain char- 
acteristically feminine qualities, as introspection 
and quickness in grasping motives and passions 
underlying action. Woman's view of life as 
represented in fiction is shown, however, to be 
largely objective. Women have developed the 
historical novel ; have brought the novel of mys- 
tery to a high state of perfection, but have left 
the most enduring stamp on literature as realists. 
All of which goes, perhaps, to suggest a not 
uncharacteristic inconsistency. It should be 
noted that this book portrays a succession of 
personalities, and that the author's intention is 
evidently to reveal or suggest the type through 
them, rather than to regard the type as the main 
thing and them as incidental or merely illustra- 
tive. The method of the writer here, then, is 
just the reverse of that of Professor Canby ; 
and hers is a far simpler task. Miss Whitmore's 
book is an enlarged master's thesis ; and it has 
some of the defects of its qualities. It suggests 
the student rather than the real critic in its 
frequent and lengthy citations of the opinions 
of others. An irritating rather than a serious 
fault is the overlooking of several misprints 
like " Maria Edgewood " (p. 102) and " Rodney 
Crawley " (p. 164). A matter of greater im- 
portance is the allotting of so little space as a 
couple of pages to so great a figure as George 
Eliot. Generally, the strength of the work does 
not lie in the treatment of the jrreatM writers. 
Perhaps the chief value of the book lies in its 
bringing to light again forgotten or half -forgot- 
ten names such as Margaret of Newcastle, 
Mrs. Haywood, and the " Sidney Biddulph " 
of Mrs. Sin -ridan : in its suggesting the real 
importance of time-dimmed figures in their 
contribution to the history and development of

fiction ; and its emphasizing frequently both 
the salient characteristics of a writer's work 
and her relation to the general scheme. As 
a handy reference-book, and a chart of the 
woman-novelist field previous to 1865, it has its 
useful place. 

Characteristics of the work of Professor 
Burton are generally recognized. In his study 
of the " Masters of the English Novel " it is not 
his object primarily to grub for the origin of a 
type and laboriously to track its evolution ; nor 
does he attempt to force a way into brambly 
and neglected by-paths of literature seeking for 
modest merit lowly laid. His course stretches 
over literary heights. There he paces with the 
practised tread and assured step of one on con- 
genial ground and at home in high places, yet 
not unmindful of the world below and of an 
author's relation to it. He treats the greatest 
novelists Richardson through Hardy show- 
ing what part they played in the development 
of the novel, and what part the novel played as 
a depicter of the spirit of the times. One feels 
that the writer is no novice at his task. At 
times, however, one pauses long before accepting 
some of his critical dicta. Remembering some 
of the most famous or notorious novels of the 
century, one may question, for instance, such a 
generalization as this : 

" The novel seems to have been the special literary 
instrument in the eighteenth century for the propaga- 
tion of altruism; here lies its deepest significance." 

Also, one may think Fielding too much depre- 
ciated in comparison with Smollett. Condem- 
nation of Coleridge's opinion of the plot of 
"Tom Jones," and invidious praise of Smollett's 
characterization, are judgments in which not all 
would care to coincide. They do, however, 
prepare us for Professor Burton's appreciation 
of Dickens, and for his mention of " Henry 
Esmond " and The Tale of Two Cities " in 
the same breath, naming the latter first. The 
book is excellently appreciative of Hardy, and 
fairly so of Scott and Stevenson ; and if it 
lauds Dickens in accordance with the grow 
ing fashion of our day, it also does justice to 
Thackeray. One finds in the book the reflective 
work of a class-room lecturer, vivifying familiar 
names and writing stimulating criticism with 
depth of purpose and an attractive style. 

" Leading American Novelists," by Professor 
John Erskine, is a needed book in a promising 
field. The value of American fiction, in its 
scope, development, and significance, has been 
so inadequately recognized that a worthy con- 
tribution to the subject is deserving of especial 



note. Professor Erskine has focused his atten- 
tion on six figures: Brown, Cooper, Simms, 
Hawthorne, Mrs. Stowe, Bret Harte. To each of 
these he allots a chapter, headed by a full-page 
illustration of the author dealt with. Such an 
arrangement, with its suggestion of emphasized 
mechanical divisions of the subject into just so 
many or just so few parts, has this disadvan- 
tage that it may recall to mind the method 
of the grade-school text-book ; also, where only 
few authors are chosen for criticism and where 
not all are of the highest class, it accentuates 
the relative unimportance of the minor figures. 
William Gilmore Simms. for instance, seems 
hardly to deserve the height of his pedestal; 
and to devote almost a seventh of one's space to 
Harriet Beecher Stowe appears too wanton an 
assertion of the poverty of our American pro- 
duct in fiction. More lives, more life, and less 
protracted criticism in the case of minor work, 
would have better covered the field and revealed 
a truer sense of proportion. In the details of 
his criticism, however, one follows Professor 
Erskine with confidence. Although he disclaims 
an attempt at originality in final judgments, 
endeavoring to render the opinion of the best 
critics of to-day rather than his own individual 
impressions, he deserves commendation for show- 
ing excellent taste in choosing his sources, and, 
instead of tiresomely quoting, for fusing all his 
material into a well-rendered and generally con- 
vincing form. What is said in different parts 
of his book especially of Brown, Hawthorne, 
Cooper, and Bret Harte is illuminating, and 
suggests the taste of the true critic. He is 
generally consistent in his critical attitude. The 
separate stars in his galaxy of critical opinion 
go together to make up a "firmament of light." 
One would especially recommend the book for 
its well-stated and deep critical generalizations ; 
and its author for giving evidence of possession of 
the " seeing eye," and for revealing himself as a 
worthy seeker of the light a consistent follower 
of the Gleam. STEPHEN FAUNCE SEARS.

dices which we hope to obliterate? Perhaps 
such a use might be made of the works that 
have resulted from Mrs. Catherine Seipp's 
prizes, offered in 1904, for the best essays on 
the German Element in the United States. But 
if interest and pride in ancestry and nationality 
are themselves justifiable and who will doubt 
this ? then Professor Faust's work on this 
subject is justified. And for the Germans, 
more than for other nationalities perhaps, such 
a summary of their worth and achievements was 
called for because, since the employment of 
German mercenaries in the British army during 
the Revolutionary War, there has existed more 
or less unreasoning prejudice against them, 
manifested under the ignorant application of 
the would-be contemptuous epithet " Dutch " 
to all persons of Teutonic origin, saving Anglo- 
Saxons and Scandinavians. 

Inevitably, the task set by Mrs. Seipp must 
ever be an incompleted one. But for all that, 
the beginning could not be put off indefinitely. 
Several earlier attempts had been made to sur- 
vey the German element in the United States, 
and a number of Germanistic societies have 
been engaged for twenty years in gathering 
materials in particular German centres nota- 
bly the German-American Historical Society of 
Pennsylvania. Professor Faust found, there- 
fore, much material ready to hand, while for 
some ten years he had been preparing for the 
undertaking. In the nature of the case, he 
could not visit and examine personally all the 
German settlements and institutions in our 
country, but he has shown due diligence in 
gathering by correspondence much first-hand 
material. 

In the two large volumes of his work he treats 
his subject first historically and then topically. 
This leads naturally to some repetition ; but with 
so large a mass of material it was certainly well 
to resort to this method of making it accessible 
from different points of view. 

It is not remarkable that Professor Faust's 
work often assumes the tone of a defence and a 
eulogy. Occasionally this tone might have been 
subdued. In the opening chapter, for instance, 
the claim of Mercator, a native of Belgium, of 
~yrker in Ericson's problematic voyage to 
America, of Fabian, a Swiss, as representatives 
of the German element would justify extending 
he claim to include the entire Anglo-Saxon 
portion of the English-Scotch settlers. But on 
the whole this tendency to claim credit is not 
unpleasantly obvious. 

Neither does a careful inspection reveal many 



hooks for the little tags of detailed critic 'ism. 
The contents table is clear and full, and the illus- 
trative plates and maps and tables an- IIUMIIT- 
ous and genuinely helpful as a rule. Firmian 
(p. 235, I.) is not a principality; Waldo's son 
lived in Frankfurt at the LntJn rhunn^ not at 
the house of Luther (p. 258, I.); there is no 
prominent Mennonite colony " German ia " in 
Kansas (p. 501, I.); and the work of C. B. 
Schmidt, Immigration Commissioner of the 
A. T. & S. F. Ky., in establishing German col- 
onies, might well have been mentioned. But 
these are very minor matters. 

Professor Faust has brought his material 
down to date, and has furnished a work that 
may almost be called monumental. He writes 
simply and clearly. He has presented very justly 
a survey of the really notable contribution of 
Germany to the commercial, religious, and edu- 
cational life of the United States, a survey 
that may serve both for the gratification of the 
patriotic German here or in Germany, and for 
the illumination of the non-Germans who too 
often underestimate that contribution.

NEW STUDIES ix FRENCH LITERATURE.* 



In view of the studies of French literature by 
Saintsbury and Dowden to mention only two, 
and the translation into English of Brune- 
tie're's Manual, a new work on so comprehensive 
and important a subject must show cause for its 
appearance. Mrs. Anna Lemp Konta's " His- 
tory of French Literature" does not lack in 
comprehensiveness, certainly, since it extends 
from the oath of Strasburg to " Chantecler " 
which, by the way, is steadily misprinted 
" Chanticler " in her pages. Nor is it impossi- 
ble to say some pleasant things of the book. In 
general, and especially when dealing with the 
modern period, the author exhibits an intelli<:< nt 
grasp upon essentials and in a sketchy way makes 
a story that, while very readable, is not untrust- 
worthy because of ignorance or eccentricity. She 
is, too, keenly aware of latter-day manifestations. 
Her method admits of frequent quotation, and 
this, in a work for the most part frankly deriva- 
tive, adds to its value, and has been used in the 
main with discretion, although at times it makes 
the page a patchwork rather than one blending. 

But to go further and claim for the book dis- 
tinction of manner, or the philosophic correla-

tions which such a work, to become first-rate, 
demands, would be going altogether too far. 
There is a failure in English idiom which at 
times gives a naive effect to the style ; and one 
could write a volume concerning disagreements 
and corrections, when it comes to details. In 
the chapter on the Modern Drama, for example, 
Brieux is disposed of by the remark that he 
"has come to be accepted as a satirist of a sort," 
which seems peculiarly mal apropos in view of 
that distinguished playwright's recent election 
to the Academy. Or again, in the treatment 
of Zola, to declare that the trilogy of the cities 
" has not enhanced his reputation " is certainly 
to make a mistake in relative values. The chap- 
ter on Recent Poetry is an extreme illustration 
of the danger of trying to summarize important 
writers by a line or a phrase ; nor can one accept 
the sweeping statement that " French genius 
does not lean to lyricism." The description of 
Rostand's new drama has mistakes which cannot 
but awaken suspicion as to the critic's method; 
she is wrong in saying that one of the actors 
steps before the curtain and announces it as a 
play of animals, and wrong again in saying that 
it is written in modern French pentameters, 
since it is, of course, written in Alexandrines. 
Or to go back a little in speaking of George 
Sand the author says that this great novelist 
read the principal works of Locke, Bacon, Rous- 
seau, Aristotle, Pascal, Montaigne, and other 
masters, and then comments : " Her literary 
talent proceeds from these authors ; personal 
inspiration has added to it a stamp of original- 
ity," to put it mildly, an odd way of expressing 
the thought. A good word should be said for 
the chapter on the French Press, a phase of 
letters too often overlooked. 

One could wish that with a book so readable, 
which avoids the sin of dulness, more accuracy 
might have been attained, and the organic rela- 
tions of the subject so presented as to bring 
the study into a truer unity. 

RICHARD BURTON. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



The diverting Mr ' Adrian Hoffman Joline is not 
reflections of only an enthusiastic autograph- 
a book-lover. collector and a true lover of books ; 
he is also sufficiently a man of affairs, being a New 
York lawyer in active practice, to be saved from 
the pitiable fate not uncommon to bibliophiles, of 
becoming possessed with the notion that the world of 
books is the only real world, and the outside universe 
its grossly imperfect imitation. Hence his chatty vol- 



ume, "At the Library Table" (Badger), is agreeably 
sprinkled with worldly-wise observations, besides 
containing many of the expected praises of first edi- 
tions and Cobden-Sanderson bindings, and notes on 
other matters familiar to bibliophilosophical persons. 
The title of the book is also that of the first chapter, 
which has, of course, nothing to do with the public- 
library table, a piece of furniture evidently abhorred 
by Mr. Joline almost as much as he dislikes a card- 
catalogue and sundry other appurtenances of " the 
people's university " a frame of mind natural and 
permissible in one who enjoys the possession of a 
good library of his own. Chapter two contains the 
diverting "Deliberations of a Dofob" (a Dofob, we 
infer from the context, being a "D d Old Fool On 
Books ") . Then come two more chapters of mingled 
literary and reminiscent character, and finally two 
longer disquisitions on William Harrison Ainsworth 
and G. P. R. James. A footnote in the James article 
questions the truth of the report that the novelist of 
solitary-horseman fame was sometimes called George 
Prince Regent James, and that many even believed 
this to be his real name. On this point Mr. George 
Gary Eggleston's lately-published " Recollections " 
has a few authoritative words, from which it appears 
that the curious appellation originated in Richmond, 
where it gained common currency and was considered 
peculiarly apt. Mr. Joline shows himself a good 
hater of automobiles and motor-cycles, a stanch 
defender of General McClellan, no admirer of 
Charles Sumner, nor of " the deified murderer and 
horse-thief, John Brown," nor, finally, of " the mod- 
ern smooth-faced devotee of the safety razor, who 
freely permits the unattractive contour of his mouth 
to betray the imperfections of his character." But 
we all have our ingrained likes and dislikes. He has 
permitted his pen, or his printer, to speak of Mr. 
" Crother " and the poet " Keat " or, rather, he 
has used the possessives "Crother's" and "Keat's," 
which is practically the same to the critical eye. On 
the whole, Mr. Joline has given us a worthy successor 
to the " Meditations of an Autograph Collector " 
and "The Diversions of a Book Lover." 

The beginning Mr " Percival Lowell is an artist in 
and the end the writing of popular books on 
of worlds. astronomy. While, as is well known, 

his chief interests lie with the planet Mars, con- 
cerning which he has published two interesting 
works, he has lately produced a volume of wider 
range, entitled "The Evolution of Worlds" (Mac- 
millan). Like all his books, this one is a delight to 
the eye, being sumptuously printed, tastefully bound, 
and finely illustrated. The elegance of its make-up 
is well matched by the fascinating style in which it 
is written. The title of this latest essay on astro- 
nomical evolution is somewhat larger than the 
subject ; for the author confines himself to a con- 
sideration of the birth of a system like that of our 
sun and its attendant planets. The systems of 
double-stars, which bestrew the sky by the tens of 
thousands, are not studied. The original hypothet-

THE DIAL,

ical nebula, from which Laplace traced the develop- 
ment of our system, is relegated to the astronomical 
ash-heap. Mr. Lowell says : " Darwin's theory dis- 
tinctly avers that we were not descended from 
monkeys; and Laplace's fire-mist under modern 
examination evaporates away." To account for the 
origin of our system we are introduced to the more 
modern speculation that some dark star, feeling its 
way by the starlight through the darkness of infinite 
space, comes into collision with another star, or at 
best barely grazes it Titanic forces are thus 
brought into play. The encountering worlds are 
disintegrated, and the ruins assume the form of a 
spiral nebula. From this beginning of our family 
of planets, Mr. Lowell leaps lightly over unmeasured 
aeons of time, and proceeds to describe the inner 
group of planets chiefly Mercury and Venus, as 
we see them to-day with special reference to the 
observations made at his own observatory at Flag- 
staff, Arizona. The asteroids and the large outer 
planets are next described in illuminating fashion. 
The reader is then in position to understand better 
the ensuing discussion of the formation of the planets 
from the spiral nebula, and of their subsequent his- 
tory as the heated masses gradually become cold, and 
fit for the support of life analogous to that on tha 
earth. This part of the argument is beset with 
numerous pitfalls for even the wariest feet, which 
the author seems to realize, when he says : " Attack- 
ing the subject in this judicial spirit, the reader can 
hardly expect one to satisfy him with a cosmogony 
entirely home-made, but at best to pursue a happy 
middle course between creator and critic, advocating 
only such portions as happen to be my own, while 
sternly exposing the mistakes of others." Having 
led us in this manner through the history of the 
planets down to our own day, Mr. Lowell goes 
further and considers the death of a world. The 
moon is already dead ; Mars is going into senility. 
Even the sun itself, now so plethoric with energy, 
will some day lose its last spark. "(Jhost-like it 
will travel through space, unknown, unheralded, 
till another collision shall cause it to take a place 
again among the bright company of heaven." The 
cycle of change is then finished, and a new cycle 
has begun. 

Dr. Henry Smith Williams is in 
man y wa y 8 qualified to speak author- 
itatively on the rules to be followed 
in order to secure comfort of body and peace. of 
mind. His book on " The Science of Happiness " 
( Harper) forms an excellent manual of self-culture, 
physical and mental, and is of a literary quality that 
makes it pleasant reading, didactic and moralizing 
though its tone necessarily is. The problem of happi- 
ness he considers under four aspects the physical, 
the mental, the social, and the moral. In his gen- 
eral directions for bodily health, he makes right eat- 
ing so fine an art that "every indigestible particle 
of food taken into the stomach, and every particle 
of any kind in excess of what is needed " are to be 



regarded as dietetic blunders. But Dr. Woods 
Hntchinson has with equal emphasis declared that 
our digestive machinery need not be and ought not 
to be considered as so delicately adjusted a nierlian- 
ism ; it calls for coarse as well as fine material, 
hence the reason of " shredded doormats " on our 
breakfast table. In treating of methods of work, 
the author makes regularity and method all-essential, 
even for literary workers, asserting that " most suc- 
cessful artists and authors even learn this lesson 
finally, and, instead of waiting for inspiration, drive 
themselves to the task at a given time, and grind 
away regardless of desire for rest till a reasonable 
work is done." It is more than doubtful if the best 
creative work in literature has been done in this 
plodding fashion. u We cannot kindle when we will 
the fire which in the heart resides." Among the pen- 
slips that have crept into the book, some imp of the 
ink-bottle has made the author write " 60 dollars " 
as the equivalent of " eight hundred francs " in 
the very chapter that inculcates the necessity of 
accuracy. "Climatic" occurs, intentionally or other- 
wise, apparently in the sense of "climacteric." And, 
finally, the eminent scientist allows himself the 
etymologically unscientific if not downright mean- 
ingless phrase, " to perpetrate senile views." But 
these are comparative trifles. As the well-pondered 
utterance of one speaking from ample personal 
knowledge even though the chapter on " How to 
Die " necessarily lacks the note of actual experience 
the book commands and will receive the ready 
attention of many readers. 



Home activity have written much, 

at the North in and somewhat minutely, of economic 
the Civil War. an( j c j v y con( litions in the South in 
the days of the Confederacy, but conditions in the 
North during the War have received less attention. 
With the exception of a short chapter in Mr. Rhodes's 
History, little has hitherto been done to exhibit the 
industrial and social side of life in the Northern 
States from 1861 to 1865. Hence Dr. Emerson 
David File's "Social and Industrial Conditions in 
the North During the Civil War " (Macmillan) is 
a needed work. While in the Confederacy every 
industry languished, in the North every industry 
made unprecedented progress, and at the end of the 
war the North was actually wealthier than in 1861. 
This progress was due, as Dr. Fite shows, not alone 
to the artificial stimulus of the war, but it was based 
on solid economic foundations. Of new conditions 
brought about by the war, one of the most interest- 
ing was the tendency toward consolidation. This was 
seen not only in the centralization of the government, 
but in the combination of transportation agencies, 
of capital, of manufacturing plants, of banking and 
telegraph systems. Local railway lines were com- 
bined to make trunk systems; capitalists pooled 
their resources, and manufacturers drew together 
to monopolize certain fields of production. Popular 
education was stimulated by the war, though the 
enrolment fell off for a time in the best college*.

The nouveau riche flourished, but in the North as 
in the South the finest expression of popular feeling 
was in the charitable and relief work conducted 
mainly for the benefit of the soldiers. Yet while 
industries made progress, and capital was multiplied, 
the average laborer was pinched by hard times. 
Wages did not rise to correspond with the increased 
cost of living, and the development of labor-saving 
machinery prevented the laborers who remained at 
work from profiting by the absence of those who 
served in the army. Dr. Fite's work shows a thor- 
ough acquaintance with the material relating to the 
subject ; it is interesting in itself, and valuable for 

reference. ___ 

In a volume entitled " Revolution, 
C and ther Ey " (Macmillan) Mr. 
Jack London gathers together a 
baker's dozen of brief papers written within the last 
ten years, and treating chiefly of the capital-and- 
labor question and the general iniquity of the present 
order of things in our society and government. 
Much is said, first and last, of the prosperous folk 
who go on " prattling sweet ideals and dear moral- 
ities," blissfully unconscious of the volcano on which 
their prosperity rests, and which some day will 
burst and make havoc of all these smug prattlers of 
sweet ideals and dear moralities. The revolutionists 
that are to effect this righting of wrongs are counted 
as seven million strong, and continually increasing. 
The writer does a service in calling renewed atten- 
tion, in language idiomatically forceful, to some of 
the defects and injustice of the existing social order, 
and especially to the frightful hardships now suf- 
fered by the poorest classes among the unskilled 
laborers ; but his comparison of the average cave- 
dweller's lot with that of the thousands of over- 
worked and underfed men, wome.n, and children of 
the present day, hardly establishes the primitive 
man's greater immunity from suffering and danger, 
and leaves out of account his vastly lower state of 
civilization as compared with that of the modern 
world. We cannot, even viewing the world through 
the socialist's or the nihilist's spectacles, believe that 
it has been retrograding through all the centuries, 
or that revolution, in the commonly accepted sense 
of the term, is to be the ultimate salvation of the 
race. Some of Mr. London's pages are personal 
and autobiographical in character, and hence of 
peculiar interest. The book contains food for 
thought, and its style is the opposite of wearisome. 
A passing apt quotation from Erasmus both sur- 
prises and delights the bookish reader. 

imaginary Mr - Maurice Baring's "Dead Let- 
correspondence ters " ( Houghton) must have been 
with the great. as amu sing in the writing as they 
are in the reading. Appearing first in the London 
"Morning Post," they entertained many readers, 
and, incredible though it may appear, imposed upon 
not a few who, by the author's confession, wrote to 
him requests for further details from his secret 
sources of information. As these imaginary sources 



have to do, in part, with Clytaemnestra and 
thus, Cleopatra and Antony, Lear and his daughters, 
Romeo and Juliet, and various other ancient or 
semi-mythological personages, one must be preter- 
naturally credulous to take the packet of letters in 
sober earnest. The local color, too, and the inci- 
dental allusions are not studied with wearisome 
accuracy, nor were they intended to pass muster 
with the severely critical. Lighter and shorter and 
more colloquial than Landor's " Imaginary Con- 
versations," these letters are in many instances 
written (supposedly) by women, and are hence the 
ready medium of much amusing gossip and some 
equally amusing spitefulness. The author enjoys a 
free hand in whitewashing any historic character 
that may have fallen into a disrepute which he 
thinks unmerited. Messalina, for instance, he pic- 
tures as an angel of innocence and the unhappy 
victim of envy and malice. Marcus Aurelius, on 
the other hand, appears as a tiresome pedant, wear- 
ing the aspect of " a barber who catered for the 
aristocracy," as the author expresses it, with some 
confusion of trades. Among the moderns, Heine 
and Goethe and Peter the Great are familiarly 
introduced. But, on the whole, it is when dealing 
with personages of antiquity or mythology that Mr. 
Baring lets himself go with most effect. As a 
pleasant reminder of our schoolday studies not a 
painful reminder of how much we have forgotten 
since then the book is excellent vacation reading. 

The laureate of the Confederacy is 
f . the distinction claimed for the author 

of " Maryland, My Maryland " by 
Mr. Matthew Page Andrews in his recent edition 
of " The Poems of James Ryder Randall " (The 
Tandy-Thomas Co.). To this judgment, admirers 
of Ryan and Timrod will give but tardy assent. 
Nevertheless, the editor of the present volume brings 
to the support of his position the alleged assertion of 
Oliver Wendell Holmes that " My Maryland " was 
" the greatest of all poems produced by the War "; 
and he might have urged in further support of his 
position that Randall composed a considerably larger 
body of war verses than did either of his rivals. But 
in justice to all concerned, it should be said that, 
with the exception of his famous battle-song, Randall 
wrote little that can compare with the best that 
Timrod and Ryan did. The volume contains, besides 
the war-lyrics, about fifty other short pieces, the 
bulk of them either personal and reminiscential in 
nature, or of the knee-buckle variety. Few of these 
display much of freshness or of finish, and still fewer 
exhibit anything of power. In an interesting intro- 
duction, however, the editor makes it plain why 
Randall did not accomplish greater things : like 
most of his fellow-poets of the South, he could not 
bring himself to look upon verse-making as a serious 
business, but conceived of it merely as a more or less 
respectable sort of diversion. But that Randall had 
keen insight into things, and was capable of strong 
feeling and of considerable power in expressing it

is clearly shown by the account given of his life and 
work, chiefly in the field of journalism. Moreover, 
he possessed a large soul, and was the most modest 
and unselfish of men. 

^ anyone doubts that dogs have 
some power so nearly resembling 
reason that it is not worth while to 
hunt for another name by which to call it. let him 
read Mr. Henry C. Merwin's " Dogs and Men " 
(Houghton), reprinted, with illustrations and a few 
additions, from "The Atlantic Monthly." The 
human feeling that throbs in the canine heart and 
looks out of the canine eye is dwelt upon and exem- 
plified in a most interesting way, and the author 
even goes so far as to declare that " the mission of 
the dog I say it with all reverence is the same 
as the mission of Christianity, namely, to teach 
mankind that the universe is ruled by love." Speak- 
ing of a certain familiar class of smugly self-satisfied 
and eminently respectable persons into whose blood 
there has crept "a coldness that would chill the 
heart of a bronze statue," he thus continues : " Such 
persons are really degenerates of their peculiar 
kind, and need to be saved, perhaps by desperate 
measures. Let them elope with the cook ; let them 
get religion ; or, if they cannot get religion, let 
them get a dog, give him the run of the house, love 
him and spoil him, and so, by the blessing of Provi- 
dence, their salvation may be effected." The little 
book will delight all animal-lovers, and perhaps 
convert some animal-haters. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



"What Pictures to See in Europe in One Summer," 
by Miss Lorinda Munson Bryant, is an art guide for 
tourists who take the beaten track, and are fairly in- 
nocent of artistic cultivation when they set out. For 
such persons, books like this are no doubt useful. The 
John Lane Company are the publishers. 

The latest of Baedekers is a " Southern Germany," 
meaning Wurtemberg and Bavaria, which now reaches 
its eleventh revised edition. Although a comparatively 
small volume, it has upwards of eighty maps and plans. 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons are the importing agents 
for these guide-books. 

The excellent " Everyman's Library " is steadily 
increasing, fifty-three new titles having recently been 
added to the series, which now consists of four hundred 
and fifty-three volumes. This admirable series contains, 
as is well known, some of the choicest classics in th 
English language, neatly and tastefully bound, of con- 
venient size and good type, and procurable at a very 
modest cost. 

" Marcus Aurelius and the Later Stoics," by Dr. F. 
W. Bussell, is a new volume in the series of "The 
World's Epoch-Makers," published by Messrs. Charles 
Scribner's Sons. It is a scholarly work, and, consider- 
ing that it has to do with the expounders of what the 
author considers "an untenable creed," shows nn un- 
expected degree of sympathy with the thought of the 
imperial philosopher and his followers. 



The present overflow of Roosevelt enthusiasm finds 
appropriate expression in Mr. John T. McCutrheon's 
new volume, "T R. in Cartoons," issued by Messrs. 
A. C. McClurg & Co. The cartoons, of which there 
are over a hundred, originally appeared in The Chicago 
"Tribune," and are accompanied by a preface in which 
Mr. McCutcheon cleverly describes the ex- President as 
" a cornucopia of suggestions for cartoon material." 

From Messrs. Frederick A. Stokes Company come the 
first two volumes in a new series of monographs to be 
called Garden Flowers in Colors." Each volume con- 
tains eight illustrations of flowers in life-like colors 
reproduced with unusual skill and care by the same 
engravers who produced the illustrations for the 
"Masterpieces in Color." The text gives outlines of 
the histories and classifications of the flowers, practical 
directions for their culture, lists of varieties best suited 
for special purposes, and chapters on common insect 
pests. 

"How Americans are Governed in Nation, State, and 
City " (Harper), by Mr. Crittenden Marriott, is a text- 
book of civics marked by a strong stress upon the 
practical aspect of the problems of government, and 
presenting its array of facts in logical sequence and 
engaging exposition. The author's reasoning is not 
always sound, but his matter is usually informing and 
interesting. In his deliberate exclusion of the historical 
side of the subject, however, he has missed giving his 
book the truly educational character that such a work 
should have to commend itself to the attention of the 
teaching profession. 

" Man in Many Lands," by Mr. L. W. Lyde ( London- 
Black), is described as "an introduction to the study 
of geographic control." This means that it is intended 
to supply the information which shall answer such ques- 
tions as Why the Swedes invented cream separators, 
Why the Buddhist color should be yellow, and Why 
Portuguese women are so ugly. The author, an ex- 
aminer in geography for various institutions, gets ques- 
tions like these from many parts of the world, and thinks 
that the study of geography should supply the intel- 
ligence needed for answering them. This is a refresh- 
ing (and pedagogically sound) view to take of what is 
too often a humdrum subject, and teachers may well 
profit by the little book. It is a school book only in an 
auxiliary sense, and makes refreshing reading. There 
are many pretty illustrations in color. 

The series of plainly-worded and fully-illustrated 
little pamphlets, edited by Mr. John Cotton Dana, on 
"American Library Economy" as practised by the 
Newark (N. J.) Public Library, has now advanced to 
its Second Part, in one number, entitled " Booklists and 
Other Library Publications," the First Part being 
divided into four sections, or numbers, all treating of 
the Lending Department as it is organized at Newark. 
We thus have a pamphlet on the Registration Desk, 
one on the Charging System, one on the Administration 
of the Lending Department, and finally one on the 
Relations with the Public in this Department. Intend- 
ing librarians might be dismayed at first by the apparent 
intricacy of library management as detailed in these 
successive booklets; and they do indeed leave little to 
the reader's imagination which perhaps is well. The 
Newark library's activity in publishing numerous aids 
to readers is commendable. The series is tastefully 
executed at the Elm Tree Press, Woodstock, Vt., the 
business office of which is at 189 Broad St., Newark,

NOTES. 



A new two-volume edition of Madame Blavatsky's 
" The Secret Doctrine," reprinted from the original 
edition of 1888, is announced by the Theosophical 
Publishing Co., at Point Loma, California. 

"Making Good" is a new volume in "Harper's 
Athletic Series." Its contents are eleven short stories of 
outdoor sports, by such writers as Mr. F. H. Spearman, 
Mr. Van Tassel Sutphen, and Mr. Poultney Bigelow. 

Dr. Isaac Taylor's " Words and Places " has been 
for nearly half a century a useful work of reference. It 
is now reedited by Dr. A. Smythe Palmer, and brought 
out in an attractive new shape by Messrs. E. P. Dutton 
& Co. 

The Houghton Mifflin Co. have added to their 
" Riverside Literature Series " Mrs. Gaskell's " Cran- 
ford," edited by Mr. H. E. Coblentz, and a volume of 
selections from Irving's " Bracebridge Hall," edited by 
Mr. Samuel Thurber, Jr. 

Messrs. Duffield & Co. announce that they will 
publish Rostand's " Chantecler " in book form on 
August 15. Recent magazine advertisements, there- 
fore, stating that the play can be read in English only 
in its serial form, are misleading. 

Sainte-Beuve's " Causeries du Lundi," from October, 
1849, to March, 1851, may now be had in an English 
translation by Dr. E. J. Trechmann. The work fills 
five neat volumes, has notes and other editorial matter, 
and is published by the Messrs. Dutton. 

A paragraph in THE DIAL recently having mentioned 
that there was no known living relative of the poet 
Keats bearing his surname, a correspondent in Georgia 
writes to say that Mr. John H. Keats, son of the poet's 
brother George who settled in this country, still resides 
in Missouri, or did so at a very recent date. 

Mr. S. E. Forman, who is the author of the best text- 
book of civil government ever written for American 
students of high school age, now appears as the author 
of " A History of the United States for Schools," pub- 
lished by the Century Co. It is a book for the elemen- 
tary schools, and is amply equipped with educational 
aids besides being richly illustrated. 

Messrs. Sturgis & Walton Co. announce for early 
fall publication a book by Miss E. Sylvia Pankhurst 
entitled " The Suffragette." The author of the work, 
which is to be in a manner the official history of the 
English equal-suffrage movement, is a daughter of the 
well-known Mrs. Pankhurst, the leader of the militant 
wing of the suffrage party, who will provide the intro- 
duction. 

Messrs. Cassell & Company announce that they have 
ready for publication the first volume of " The Life and 
Times of King Edward VII," giving the story of Eng- 
land from the birth of King Edward down to the present 
day. When completed the work will be in five large 
octavo volumes. Queen Alexandra has personally given 
the publishers her consent to the reproduction of the 
photographs of the King that will appear throughout 
the work, and which, with the other illustrations, will 
form a special feature. 

Hauff's " Lichtenstein," edited by Professor James 
Percival King, is one of the most acceptable of recent 
German texts, and is published by Messrs. Henry Holt 
& Co. From Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co. we have "A 
German Grammar for Schools and Colleges," by Pro- 
fessors W. H. Fraser and W. H. van der Smissen; 



' Progressive French Idioms," compiled by M. R. de 
Blanchaud ; " French Anecdotes," arranged by Professor 
W. F. Giese and Mr. C. D. Cool; and Voltaire's 
" Zaire," edited by Professor Charles W. Cabeen. 
Messrs. Macmillan & Co. publish Louis Enault's " Le 
Chien In Capitaine, edited by Miss Margaret de G. 
Verrall. 

Mark Twain's authorized biography is already in 
preparation at the hands of Mr. Albert Bigelow Paine, 
who, with the deceased humorist's daughter, is his 
appointed literary executor. The fortunate possessors 
of letters from Mr. Clemens are requested to commu- 
nicate with Mr. Paine at Redding, Connecticut. All 
epistolary matter sent to him will be copied and returned 
to the senders. Cordial cooperation in this respect is 
earnestly desired, to the end that a full and authorita- 
tive biography may be prepared. 

The new edition of William Sharp's works, edited 
by Mrs. Sharp and published by Messrs. Duffield & 
Co., is steadily gaming headway. Of the seven vol- 
umes which are to complete the edition, the first four 
are now ready, containing " Pharais " and " The 
Mountain Lovers " ; " The Sin Eater " and " The Washer 
of the Ford "; " The Dominion of Dreams " and " Un- 
der the Dark Star "; " The Divine Adventure," " lona, 
and " Studies in Spiritual History." Each volume is 
illustrated with a frontispiece in photogravure, and both 
the type and paper are excellent. 

The Mikszath Jubilee in Hungary has been made 
memorable by that nation in a manner that does credit 
to those concerned in it. Three estates, valued at 
nearly twenty-five thousand dollars of our money, were 
presented to the veteran romancer as a jubilee gift. A 
prophet not without honor in his own country, Mikszath 
is also favorably known in America and England, chiefly 
through the English translation of his " St. Peter's 
Umbrella " a book which, according to a current 
story, Mr. Roosevelt assured its author, whom he took 
pains to meet in his late visit to Budapest, was the very 
last book he had read before leaving America for the 
jungles of Africa. It is of interest to note that much 
of Mikszath's work has first appeared serially in Kos- 
suth's old paper, Pesti Hirlap. Now that Jdkai is gone, 
the author of " St. Peter's Umbrella " is to us the most 
attractive figure in literary Hungary. 

The Lummis collection of books, paintings, and Indian 
relics, lately presented to the Southwest Museum at 
Los Angeles, is briefly described in the current issue of 
"News Notes of California Libraries." An extract 
says: "In celebration of his fiftieth birthday, and to 
round up many years' activity in various fields pertain- 
ing to the history of Spanish- America, Mr. Charles F. 
Lummis has donated to the Southwest Museum his 
entire collection of objects gathered during his travels 
through New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, and Central 
and South America, as well as his books and paintings. 
Mr. Lummis's collection of Indian relics has been rec- 
ognized by scientists as one of rare value." From a 
notice in the Los Angeles " Times " it appears that 
" the Lummis library contains over 2000 volumes and 
4000 other items. . . . Along with the library are 
given archaeological and historical collections . . . illus- 
trative of the history of the west coast of the New 
World in the last 1000 years. The Lummis collections 
and library will be maintained for the present in the 
Lummis home, which is expected to be put in trust with 
the Southwest Museum forever, with its collections."

GEORGE MEREDITH 
JAMES M. BARRIE 

AN INTERESTING SOUFENIR OF 
TITO FAMOUS LITERARY MEN 

NEITHER DORKING NOR 
THE ABBEY By j. M. BARRIE 

OF the many tributes to George Meredith 
called forth by his death last May, prob- 
ably the most appropriate and beautiful was that 
contributed by Mr. J. M. Barrie to "The West- 
minster Gazette" of London, under the title 
"Neither Dorking nor the Abbey." That this 
brilliant little essay may not be lost to the many 
who love both Meredith and Barrie, we have 
issued it in attractive booklet form, printed on 
handmade paper and silk-stitched in blue hand- 
made paper wrappers with printed title -label. 
There is a brief prefatory note, and appended are 
Thomas Hardy's fine verses on the death of Mere- 
dith. As the edition is limited, orders should be 
sent at once. Price, 50 cents, postpaid.

HARPER & BROTHERS ANNOUNCE: 

Mark Twain's Speeches 

With a Preface by Mark Twain, and an Introduction by W. D. Howells 
THIS NEW BOOK reveals Mark Twain in a new and interesting phase. Murk Twain was first of all 
a lecturer, almost before he began to writ*-. Conceived and com|K>scd to IMJ spoken, the-e spot-dies are 
even more simple and direct than hut written works. These speeches are all humorous in their style and 

method. They show one remarkable thing about Mark Twain's work, 
whether spoken or written he never repeated himself. It naturally 
follows that these lectures cover almost every conceivable -nliject. 
from weather and women to politics and fishing. The speecho \ 
Mark Twain, in point of time, cover a little more than half his life. 
Many of them were delivered at important occasions. Here will !> 
found the speech delivered at Oxford when he received the Doctor's 
degree from that university, speeches at various birthday dinners, tin- 
address delivered at the Aldrich Memorial meeting, etc.

The Wild Olive 

The remarkable new novel by the author of " The Inner Shrine " 
This week four days less than a month since it was published "The 
Wild Olive" is reported the best selling novel in the I'nited states. 
This is the verdict from country-wide sources of trade information 
"The Wild Olive" is the best, and its success is greater than "The 
Inner Shrine " because the story is greater better, finer. " The Wild 
Olive " lias a broader basis of plot, a nobler conception of character, a 
higher idealism. It is above all else a remarkably human story. 
Splendidly illustrated by Lucius Hitchcock. Post 8vo. Cloth, $1.50. 

Going Some By Rex Beach 

It is curious that a writer should have two personalities two opposite 
ides curious and most unusual. Here is Rex Beach whom we know 
only as the author of splendid stories of outdoor life. Now hi- comes 
before us in a new and surprising role as the writer of one of the very 
funniest stories ever written. It is rollicking, galloping, scintillating, 
sparkling fan from beginning to end and withal clean and sweet as a 
girl's fresh laughter. Trouble arises from the fact that the hero has led 
his friends to believe he is an athlete, when, as a matter of fact, he never 
did anything more athletic than lead the cheering for others. If you mind 
slang, keep away ! Illustrated. Post 8vo. Cloth, $1.25. 




The Ramrodders 

By Holman Day 

Here is a so-called " man's novel " which is being read by 
more women than nine-tenths of the Spring romances. 
Why? Simply because it's real a genuine M< 
power and humor. " Interest as keen and unwavering as 
that of a hunter awaUing the coming of a horn-lured 
moose is aroused in "The Ramrodders,' a powerful, im- 
portant narrative." This is the opinion of The Hotton 
Globe, which adds : "And not since David Harum days 
has such genuine, smile-making, hack-on-the-soil humor 
been found between the covers of a book. 1 '

The O'Flynn 



By Justin Huntly McCarthy 

The scene is laid in Ireland in 1689, the year of Borne 
battle. The time is a brilliant one. Irish soldiers of for- 
tune with delightful names did splendid deeds against 
deHperate odds, and fair Jacobite ladies moved gnu 
through the glitter of a transient court at Dunlin. 1 lynn 
O'Flynn is one of these soldiers of fortune and his love for

THE MYSTERY OF CULTURE. 

In a recent volume of essays which he calls 
" Academic Performances," Professor Barrett 
Wendell makes some striking observations on 
" The Mystery of Education." He refers to 
the notion common with those who have never 
been to college, that the four years spent there 
teach something positive the command of 
foreign languages, for instance, the appreciation 
of fine arts, thorough acquaintance with litera- 
ture, familiarity with science, or preeminent 
skill in some branch of activity. But, alas, he 
confesses : 

" We graduates of colleges have the sad misfortune 
to know better. Few of us, for example, who have 
studied French or German for years, can pretend to use 
a text-book in either language far less turn to the 
literature of either, as a matter of pleasure. Hardly 
one of us, unaided by translation, can make much sense 
out of a page of Latin or of Greek. Very few could 
tell you off-hand the century in which Herodotus wrote 
or Cicero, could distinguish between St. Gregory and 
Hildebrand, could give a clear account of Lady Jane 
Grey, could name the Presidents of the United States, 
could explain why no one who understands Elizabethan 
literature has ever supposed that the author of Bacon's 
Essays wrote ' Hamlet ' and The Tempest,' or could 
expound the principles of Descartes, of Locke, or of 
John Stuart Mill." 

This failure on the part of the college to place 
its graduates in possession of something hard 
and fast seems to have made a deep impression 
on one of Professor Wendell's students, who, 
on acquiring an encyclopaedia and noting within 
what moderate compass it claimed to have 
embraced all human knowledge, conceived the 
idea of mastering his encyclopedia, from A to 
Z, and of then seeking a professorship of 
universal knowledge and of sending forth his 
pupils with definite, positive, and complete 
acquisitions that should justify the years spent 
in their pursuit. 

Not less misguided than this young enthusiast 
for positive knowledge are those who imagine 
culture to be something definitely attainable by 
following a prescribed course. On the contrary, 
as Dr. Furness assured the graduating class at 
the University of Pennsylvania a few years ago, 
culture is not a result, but a process. Culture 
sought as an end is an odious thing. True 
culture, says Emerson, avoiding the finality of 
precise definition, " is the suggestion from cer- 



TILE DIAL 



[July 16, 



tain best thoughts, that a man has a range of 
affinities, through which he can modulate the 
violence of any master-tones that have a dron- 
ing preponderance in his scale, and succor him 
against himself. Culture redresses his balance, 
puts him among his equals and superiors, revives 
the delicious sense of sympathy, and warns him 
of the dangers of solitude and repulsion." It 
is, one might add, very much like happiness, 
unattainable by conscious effort, and furthest 
from us at the very moment we exclaim that 
we have grasped it. 

Unmistakable to the discerning eye, however, 
are the marks of culture in others. Reference 
was made above to Dr. Furness's commencement 
address at Philadelphia. It was on the subject 
of culture, and its tone and spirit most admir- 
ably illustrated its theme. Excellent as were 
the thoughts expressed, the manner of their ex- 
pression was even better. Let us quote a few 
sentences. Emphasizing the truth that culture 
is not a profound and exhaustive thing, but in 
its very nature superficial, the speaker said : 

Wheu the whole science of electricity was comprised 
in the solitary fact that if amber be rubbed it attracts 
straws; when all that astronomy revealed was that stars 
were exhalations which the rising sun dispersed; when 
in all chemistry there were but four elements, earth, 
air, tire, and water; and when no music was heard 
more ravishing than that extracted from three strings 
stretched across a tortoise shell, or than the breath 
blown through a reed, then, in that happy golden age, 
every man was an encyclopaedia, and culture, thorough 
and profound, might be acquired in an hour, - - then any 
child could pluck up the whole tree of knowledge by 
the roots. But we have changed all that; we are 
now the heirs of forty centuries, and the heaven-high 
Sequoias of Mariposa only very faintly symbolize the 
gigantic proportions of the same present tree of knowl- 
edge, and the concentrated devotion of a lifetime is 
demanded for a thorough mastery of a single tiny 
twig." 

It should be noted, in passing, that the speaker, 
far from making culture to consist in a smat- 
tering of all knowledge, insists on the necessity 
of thoroughness in some one chosen department. 
" Know everything of something, and something 
of everything." But in other regions, "be- 
cause we cannot distinguish all the varieties 
of Solidago, must we forego," he asks, " the 
charm of recognizing Goldenrod when it trans- 
forms an autumn meadow into a field of the 
cloth of gold ? Because we cannot expound the 
theories of the binary stars, are we to forbear 
to name the constellations of the midnight sky ? 
Shall we close our Homer because we cannot 
name the ships that went to Troy? A little 
knowledge is not a dangerous thing. If I 
cannot, for lack of time, drink deep of the 



I'i.-rian spring, let me, in heaven's name, at 
least take ;i >i]>." The office of poetry in con- 
ferring culture is dwelt upon, and, of course, 
Shakes]>eure. Kmperor, by tin- (inter of (i.nl, 
of all Literature," is proj>erly commended to 
the seeker of culture. 

These words from Dr. Furness are hero 
quoted, not because they make clear exactly 
what this mysterious thing called culture realK 
is which no words can make clear but be- 
cause they and the utterances of others on the 
subject throw some side-lights and help us to see 
at least what culture is not. Emerson, writing 
on culture fifty years ago, ranges far and wide, 
after his usual manner ; and his latitude is in 
entire harmony with the breadth of that culture 
which he sought to describe and which he him 
self exemplified. In hearty agreement, before- 
hand, with the sentiments expressed by our 
Shakespearian scholar, he says : " I am always 
happy to meet persons who perceive the trans- 
cendent superiority of Shakespeare over all 
other writers "; and further : " I like people 
who like Plato, because this love does not con- 
sist with self-conceit." Again, with the most 
liberal interpretation of the meaning of culture, 
he speaks of it as opening the sense of beauty, 
and adds : " I suffer every day from the want 
of perception of beauty in people. They do not 
know the charm with which all moments and 
objects can be embellished, the charm of man- 
ners, of self-command, of benevolence. Repose 
and cheerfulness are the badge of the gentleman, 
repose in energy." He finally sums up the 
whole matter by declaring that " a cheerful and 
intelligent face is the end of culture, and success 
enough." 

Matthew Arnold has a large and worthy 
conception of culture in asserting it to be " the 
disinterested pursuit of perfection." The end 
here is certainly sufficiently unattainable to suit 
the most ardent idealist. Not quite so good is 
his other and probably better-known definition 
of culture as " the acquainting ourselves with 
the best that has been known and said in the 
world, and thus with the history of the human 
spirit." The best that has been known and said 
is not at all times the easiest thing to determine ; 
and even if it were, a mere book-worm of good 
memory could master it without necessarily be- 
coming thereby a person of culture. 

John Addington Syraonds, while asserting 
that culture is not an end in itself. Imt that it 
" prepares man for life, for work, for action. t>i 
the reception and emission of ideas," yet mak< - 
it something a little too definite, too attainable, 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



29 



one might say, in describing it as " the raising 
of previously educated intellectual faculties to 
their highest potency by the conscious effort of 
their possessors." Better is his shorter and less 
precise definition, " self -effectuation," or the ar- 
rival at what the Germans call Selbst'dndigkeit 
except that here too we have a result rather 
than a process. A later passage has more of 
suggestion and enlightenment ; it identifies cul- 
ture with " a psychical state, so to speak, which 
may be acquired by sympathetic and assimila- 
tive study." By a rather unexpected concession 
from this eminent humanist, humanism and 
also science are named as the "two principal 
methods for arriving at the ends involved in 
culture." But it is soon added that if, as Pope 
asserts, "the proper study of mankind is man," 
then humanism must always hold the first place 
in the higher intellectual culture. 

Curious and perplexing are the relations 
of culture to genius and of genius to culture. 
Talent and culture naturally consort with each 
other, but genius is impatient of all rules and 
limitations. Burns and Turner and Walt Whit- 
man were hardly men of culture, perhaps because 
they were so much more. Goethe and Heine, 
Dante and Petrarch and Tasso, Milton and 
Keats, were all cultured men of genius. To 
Shakespeare it would be absurd to deny cul- 
ture, and it would be scarcely less absurd, or at 
least it would be feeble and pointless, to ascribe 
it to him. " Genius does what it must, but 
talent does what it can," is the one memorable 
line in the works of a poet not otherwise mem- 
orable. Self -effectuation by conscious effort 
is not what we see in the manifestations of 
genius. Self -suppression is what would require 
the conscious effort. It is the innate, the invol- 
untary, the compelling, the something independ- 
ent of culture and defiant of law and custom, 
that startles the world and forces it to stand still 
and admire. Nothing has it to do with that cul- 
ture which, entering into the life of the specialist 
absorbed in the study of tadpoles or of Jupiter's 
moons, teaches him his and their true relations 
to the universe. 

It is safer, and more likely to profit us, to 
make our conception of culture too generous, 
too inclusive, too vague even, than to form it 
on too narrow and inflexible lines. The defini- 
tions and general descriptions found in the 
authors cited above, and in others, are collec- 
tively not unsatisfying ; but no one formula 
seems to cover all that is meant by culture. 
Probably no formula satisfactory to all could 
ever be framed. Possibly it may suffice for the 



present to conceive of the essence of culture as 
lying in that intellectual and emotional awaken- 
ing that comes with wider knowledge and deeper 
insight, and that is promoted by the study of 
the best in literature and art. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE DEATH OF CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER reminds 
us a little sadly of the fast decreasing number of 
those who were contributors to THE DIAL in its 
earlier years. Mr. Fuller or " Mel " Fuller, as 
his friends knew him then was a great reader of 
books of all sorts, and an excellent reviewer of them. 
He did not disdain the novel ; and his first contribu- 
tion to THE DIAL (Jan. 1, 1881) was a four-column 
review of Disraeli's "Endymion," which had then 
just appeared. It was one of the "best sellers" of 
its day largely because, as the reviewer said, it 
was "the work of a Prime Minister of England." 
The novel fails, we are told, in "the only real test 
of the merit of a production like this" in anything 
like a masterly delineation of character; and the 
summing up is that "upon the whole, the Earl of 
Beaconsfield must depend for posthumous fame upon 
something else than his novels " an opinion which 
time has pretty well approved. Mr. Fuller was espe- 
cially fond of biography, and contributed to an early 
number of THE DIAL an extended review of the life 
of General Hancock, a character whom Mr. Fuller 
greatly admired, not only as a gallant soldier but 
because of his " profound sense of the importance 
of subordinating the military to the civil authority," 
and his "deep conviction of the utility of the peace- 
ful methods of civil government." " Paternalism, 
with its constant intermeddling with individual free- 
dom, has no place in a system which rests upon the 
self-reliant energies of the people." was the demo- 
cratic utterance of the future Chief Justice. Others 
of Mr. Fuller's biographical writings were on John 
Quincy Adams (THE DIAL, April 1, 1882) and on 
Jefferson and Hamilton (May 1, 1883). Readers 
of the present day might find entertainment in Mr. 
Fuller's eight-column review of a life of Benton 
by Theodore Roosevelt (May 1, 1887), in which the 
reviewer finds that " Mr. Roosevelt holds the pen of 
a ready writer, and has a mind definitely made up 
as to public men and measures of the period under 
consideration." A peculiar interest attaches to an 
article on Chief Justice Marshall (THE DIAL, May 
1, 1885), of whom Mr. Fuller said : " In mere juridi- 
cal learning he has been surpassed by some, but in 
the power of pure reason by none." An illustration 
of Mr. Fuller's highly devout nature is revealed in 
this passage: "Numerous personal incidents are 
narrated in illustration of the simplicity of his 
[Marshall's] character ; but there is none more 
striking than the fact that the head of the most 
powerful tribunal on earth never retired to rest 
without repeating the Lord's Prayer and the lines

commencing 'Now I lay me down to sleep.' As 
the yean pass, the fame of thin great man continues 
to shine with undiminished lustre, and so will con 
tinue until the firmament front whence beam the 
glories of Tribonian and D'Aguesseau, of Hale and 
Mansfield, is rolled together like a scroll." And 
these words were penned but three years before Mr. 
Fuller stepped from private life to occupy the posi- 
tion of the illustrious jurist of whom he wrote. 


I Hi: ANNUAL OVERHAULING OF OUR EDUCA- 
TIONAL METHODS has been going on in Boston, with 
teachers reckoned by the tens of thousands from all 
parts of the country in attendance. As is usual on 
such occasions, there has been much criticism of 
the existing order, much attempt to tear down, and 
some worthy endeavor to build up. Outspoken cen- 
sure of the Carnegie Foundation as " one of the 
biggest monopolies in education that ever existed " 
was heard at one meeting ; at another, college men 
were pronounced incompetent for practical work as 
compared with high-school graduates, the colleges 
having become rather social and sporting clubs than 
training schools ; and, again, colleges and univer- 
sities were declared to be usurping the functions 
of the normal school, functions that they are not 
qualified or intended to perform. In a discussion 
concerning the teaching of English, one speaker 
found fault with the material placed before the pupil 
as too remote, not of present and living interest, 
and urged the study of authors more likely to rivet 
the young reader's attention. Perhaps there is 
danger here of conceding too much to the pupil's 
intellectual laziness. Those instructors in Knglish 
who use in their classes current clippings from the 
newspapers, instead of Goldsmith and Burke and 
Charles Lamb and Walter Scott, for serious study 
and discussion, may succeed in arousing the pupil's 
interest ; but whether it is an interest that is worth 
arousing, or the highest and best sort of interest that 
can be aroused, are open to serious question. The 
most notable incident of the Boston meeting was 
the choice of Mrs. Young of Chicago for President 
the first time a woman has ever been President of 
the National Education Association. 



THE KINO AND THE MAN OF LETTERS are both 
human beings, and one likes to see them meet occa- 
sionally on that common footing of humanity. Mr. 
Arthur C. Benson adds a bit of personal reminis- 
cence to his graceful tribute to King Edward the 
Third, in the June ' Cornhill." " I came away," 
he says, "from an interview with the King at 
Buckingham Palace, in which he had spoken to 
me very warmly and graciously of the Letters of 
Queen Victoria. When I came out, an Equerry, 
with whom I was acquainted, was waiting for me. 
'Well,' he said, 'how did you fare?' I said the 
only words which came into my mind : 'The Kini; 
was very kind.' ' He always is,' said the Equerry, 
with a smile. That was the simple secret an 
invariable and genuine kindness, which streamed 



from the King like light from the sun." And 
further praise of his gentle dignity and j^reat charm 
follows. Compart* with thin Boswell's account of 
Johnson's memorable interview with George the 
Third in the Queen's Library at Buckingham House 
on the site of the present Buckingham Palace 
where Mr. Benson had his interview. " After the 
King withdrew," writes Boswell, " Johnson shewed 
himself highly pleased with his Majesty's conver- 
sation and gracious behaviour. He said to Mr. 
Barnard [the librarian], 'Sir, they may talk of the 
King as they will; but he is the finest gentleman I 
have seen.' And he afterwards observed to Mr. 
Langton, ' Sir, his manners are those of as fine a 
gentleman as we may suppose Lewis the Fourteenth 
or Charles the Second.'" Again, with pleasing 
frankness, he assured Sir Joshua Reynolds, " I find 
it does one good to be talked to by his Sovereign "- 
although Johnson, as he himself admits, did the 
greater part of the talking. Mr. Benson and Johnson 
agree in finding the near presence of royalty stimu- 
lating and genial. ... 

UTILITABIAN SUBSTITUTES FOR POLITE LEARN- 
ING, in our colleges and universities, are so rapidly 
crowding Plato and Aristotle, Homer and Virgil, 
Thucydides and Tacitus, into the background, that 
in a few more decades it will be a marvel to find a 
bachelor of arts who has ever even heard, for 
example, of the Peripatetic School, or who can tell, 
off-hand, who wrote the " Agricola," and whether the 
same pen produced the " Jugurtha." At this season 
there are appearing sundry interesting announce- 
ments of new and never-before-imagined courses of 
study for the coming college year. The University 
of Wisconsin, for instance, will henceforth give 
instruction in "wood technology" to those yearning 
for a closer acquaintance with the chemical com- 
position and physical properties of beech, birch, 
and maple, and other members of the tree family. 
At the University of Rochester, Mr. Howard T. 
Mosher will in the autumn take his seat in the 
brand-new chair of "citizenship" and proceed to 
teach the principles of sanitation, fire protection, 
police administration, school systems, water work.-. 
care of streets, and much else that relates to muni- 
cipal or village life. It is to be noted that the new 
course does not promise to make good citizens of all 
those who pursue it, good citizenship like good 
morals being far less a thing of theory than of 
practice. 

A SUPERFLUOUS YARD OF PUBLIC-LIBRARY RED 

TAPE still remains, in some places, for reform and 
common-sense to cut away. In connection with the 
recent action of the librarian and trustees of the 
Chicago Public Library in deciding upon a partial 
adoption of the open-shelf system, a word may be 
said regarding one of the reasons commonly nrijed in 
favor of that system as against the old one of gratings 
and bars and strict formality of procedure. The 
applicant for a book, judging of its nature and con- 
tents merely from a brief catalogue entry, often has

delivered to him a volume entirely failing to meet 
his wants or equal his expectations ; but the rules 
forbid the loan and return of a book on the same 
day, hence the disappointing thing must be lugged 
home and brought back again the next day, or later, 
when a fresh trial, perhaps equally unsatisfactory, 
is made. Therefore the extreme desirability of free 
access to the books themselves. But if, as many 
librarians claim, thefts and misplacements and hard 
usage render the open-shelf system inadvisable, at 
least let the stupid and arbitrary rule governing the 
return of books be abolished. To be sure, it makes 
a little more work to have a book handed back before 
the record of its loan has been properly filed ; but 
what of that ? It is easy enough to register the return 
on a special slip and lay it aside until the next day, 
when everything can be made straight in the frac- 
tion of a minute. Some libraries, probably many, 
have adopted some such plan. But we and doubtless 
many of our readers know to our sorrow that not all 
of the closed-shelf class have yet shown this amount 
of sweet reasonableness in smoothing the path of the 
book-borrower. 



THE IDENTITY OF " GEORGE MEEK" now consti- 
tutes a " question of the hour " in literary London, 
and is turning gray the hair of the public-library 
cataloguer, who is torn with conflicting impulses 
whether to class the already famous "George Meek, 
Bath Chair-Man, by Himself " with biography under 
" Meek " or with fiction under " Wells." Certain 
chapters of the book, reinforced by certain passages 
of Mr. Wells's Introduction, almost persuade the 
cataloguer that the book is a genuine "human docu- 
ment "; and then again certain other features of 
it almost demonstrate its utter fictitiousness and 
fraudulence. The fact that "George Meek" is 
writing to the newspapers in vehement asseveration 
of his flesh-and-blood reality, and of his veritable 
authorship of his own autobiography, weighs little 
one way or the other ; it is easy enough to write 
fraudulent letters to the newspapers, after having 
once perpetrated the fraud to which they refer. 
And it would be easy enough, again, to write further 
letters vindicating the authorship of the first series, 
and so on ad infinitum, or at least to the end of the 
writer's finite existence in this world of pens and 
ink and of hoaxes and humbugs. 


THE WANDERINGS OF SABRINA, better known in 
certain college circles as the protecting divinity of 
the even-year classes at Amherst than as the nymph 
of the river Severn (Latin Sabrina), have been 
chronicled in a book that seems deserving of a place 
among the best of American student publications. 
To those who know not Sabrina, any handbook of 
classical mythology will give her pathetic history. 
Milton has honored her with brief mention in his 
" Comus." But it was left to Mr. Max Shoop, the 
goddess's guardian for the class of 1910, to prepare 
the most detailed and variously interesting account 
of the lovely maiden in his " Sabrina : the Class 



Goddess of Amherst College," which is published 
at Amherst by Mr. Shoop himself. The bronze 
(or zinc) statue which, to be honest, is the real 
subject of this truthful history, is a replica of the 
Shrewsbury representation of Sabrina, and was given 
to Amherst College in 1857 by Col. Joel Hayden of 
Haydenville, lieutenant-governor of Massachusetts 
from 1863 to 1866. The goddess's trying expe- 
rience on the college campus, and her subsequent 
many wanderings after the higher powers had re- 
fused longer to sanction her presence there, can 
readily be imagined to furnish material for the 
literary exercise of collegiate wit and wisdom. The 
much-travelled divinity was reposing in a fishing 
hamlet on the Maine coast when Mr. Shoop's book 
went to press, but was about to start on a journey for 
parts unknown, to escape the profane gaze and rude 
touch of odd-year collegians in hot pursuit of her. 



THE ELIMINATION OF THE REDUNDANT has been 
the passion of some of the greatest writers. Flau- 
bert, in seeking ever to clothe his thought in just the 
right words, with not a shade too much or too little 
of emphasis, attained to something like perfection 
in exactly fitting the expression to the idea. Cut 
his sentences and they bleed, such is the vitality of 
his style. Jules Renard, the French poet, novelist, 
essayist, and playwright, who has just died at forty- 
six, is said to have studied simplicity and brevity of 
style with an enthusiasm amounting almost to mania. 
" I would rather," he declared, "write a short story 
than a novel, I would rather write a paragraph than 
a short story, a sentence than a paragraph. I like 
to rewrite a sentence twenty times in order to give 
it the precise form that best fits it." This passion 
for restraint and economy in literary style, while it 
sometimes betrays one into mannerisms and affec- 
tations, recalls the excellent saying of the Hindu 
pundit: "A wise man rejoices more over the saving 
of a syllable than over the birth of a son." 

DISTRACTIONS FROM THE SERIOUS PURSUIT OF 
FICTION are in certain quarters making notable 
inroads on the public-library records of circulation. 
At Dubuque, Iowa, for instance, 9671 fewer novels 
were loaned in 1909 than in 1908, the circulation 
in other departments of literature remaining about 
the same. Certain Massachusetts libraries, too, have 
reported a slight decrease in circulation for the past 
year, and the suggestion has been offered that pos- 
sibly the moving-picture show is responsible. If it 
is found that only fiction is being thus slighted by 
the public, the lessened circulation need not be 
regarded with unmixed regret. Out-door pastimes, 
notably golf and automobiling, to say nothing of 
ballooning and aviation, are in the ascendant, and 
are to be encouraged. The more serious reading of 
the scholar, the writer, the literary club member, 
and others to whom the world of letters is far wider 
than the domain of English prose fiction, is not likely 
to be materially lessened by any feverish enthusiasm 
for base-ball or other passing amusement.-

A GALAHAD OF THE MAKKET-PLACE.* 

Those who knew William Henry Baldwin, Jr., 
in his lifetime, or who even met him but casu- 
ally, can never forget the charm of his person- 
ality or the beauty and strength of his character. 
Those who had not the good fortune to know 
him personally can yet frame for themselves, 
out of the record of his manifold activities and 
interests and noble enthusiasms, some fairly ac- 
curate conception of him as he lived and moved 
among his fellows during the much too short 
span of life allotted to him. The careful chron- 
icle of his brilliant achievements prepared by 
Professor John Graham Brooks, with the title 
44 An American Citizen," must appeal to all 
readers concerned with questions of social wel- 
fare and interested in the lives of those who 
have generously devoted themselves to the pub- 
lic good. 

The life of Baldwin as told by his biographer 
goes far toward disproving the common asser- 
tion that no man can play the game in the "big 
business " of the world, and win, without loss 
of moral integrity. The late president of the 
Long Island Railroad, and director or officer 
in thirty-seven other important business corpo- 
rations, held himself always ready, in spite of 
his unfailing success as a captain of industry, 
and in spite of the public service he was able 
to render in that capacity, to relinquish his post 
and devote all his energies to the numerous 
philanthropic causes that already claimed so 
much of his time and strength, if it appeared 
that his continuance in business was morally 
detrimental to himself or others. But he re- 
mained ever " the Galahad of the market-place," 
as Dr. Felix Adler called him ; " the uncor- 
rupted knight," as Dr. Slicer expressed it. 

William Henry Baldwin, Jr., was born in 
Boston, February 5, 1863, being sixth of the 
nine children of William Henry and Mary F. 
A. (Chaffee) Baldwin. The father, whose death 
last year fell within a few days of that of his 
lifelong friend Edward Everett Hale, abandoned 
money-making for philanthropy, becoming the 
first president of the Boston Young Men's 
Christian Union, and repeatedly refusing the 
most tempting inducements to devote his great 
abilities to the pursuit of gain. With such an 
example of unselfish consecration to the service

of others, it is not strange that the son, after 
completing his education at Harvard, looked 
sfurrhingly about for some good work to which 
to put his hand. The various professions, and 
especially that of the preacher, were successively 
thought of as possible gateways to a life of the 
larnvst usrfulnrss : hut noiu- s-.-nif<l .(iiitr sat- 
isfactory to the young man, although In- <li<l 
spend a few months in the 1 1:u-\.-ml Law School 
before accepting Mr. Charles Francis Adams*s 
offer of a humble position in the Union Pacific 
Railroad offices. His subsequent work in es- 
tablishing reading-rooms and libraries for the 
railway hands, his rapid advance to higher ami 
higher posts and increasing responsibilities, his 
management of the Montana Union Railroad, 
of the Flint and Pc*re Marquette, and of tl it- 
Southern, and his presidency of the Long Island 
road, constitute an enviable record of earlv- 
developed and speedily-enlarged executive capa- 
city in a most exacting department of business 
a record nowhere stained with the least sug- 
gestion of dishonorable deed or intention. 

Concerning the difficulties confronting the 
young and determinedly honest railroad man- 
ager in those early days at Butte, we read in 
Professor Brooks's pages : 

"In the getting of new business, especially in tilling 
his freight cars, he meets the familiar spectre of petty 
briberies. He finds his rivals distributing ' favors ' to 
those who have it in their power to decide where freight 
shall go. He learns that these men are often shown 
the town' by his competitors; that he too is expected 
to make provision for the display of dreary vices at 
expensive rates. With bald effrontery these practices 
have been such a part of the competitive system as to 
rank among the commonplace necessities of busim -- 
enterprise. They have taken innumerable shapes, from 
mere ' seeing the town ' with charged-up revelries in 
local dives, to the politer forms of gift and entertain- 
ment which soften and conceal the bribe through flat- 
tering indirection." 

Baldwin's way of facing such situations, of 
which he had a plenty to face in his nearly 
twenty years' experience of railroading, may 
be illustrated by his manner of attacking this 
first hard problem. Writing from Butte to a 
trusted friend, he said : 

" When I came to Butte, I had the toughest job to 
tackle on the U. P. as railroad men said, an unen- 
viable position. I was told that I would have to be a 
champion liar and become a veritable bum ' in order 
to secure any business. I gave orders at once, howcMT, 
that all business from my office must be done on an 
honorable basis, and that any statement made must be 
the truth. I decided to work the opposite of the game 
played by many of my competitors, and have business 
men feel that honor and fair treatment were our motto. 
. . . We had almost no friends, and the bitterest oppo- 
sition; and it has been the worst up-hill work." 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



33 



But he is able to write later that his plan has 
proved successful and that he can win the game 
and still keep his self-respect. " I am not a 
sentimentalist, quite the opposite," he declares 
on another occasion ; " but every day makes 
me more and more convinced that I can carry 
out my ideals which grew out of my life with 
you and a few of our common friends." Added 
to the perfect squareness of his dealings was a 
remarkable ability to get along smoothly with 
associates and subordinates. Those under him 
admired and respected him, and also felt a 
cordial liking for him ; hence they obeyed his 
orders and were always ready to listen to him 
when differences had to be adjusted to prevent 
a strike or other serious disturbance. His 
faculty for conciliating discontented or hostile 
workmen was notorious, and it became the 
habit of his superiors to " leave all the rows 
to Baldwin." It was his transparent honesty 
and his sense of fair play that prevailed where 
others would have but wasted their words. 
When the presidency of the Long Island Rail- 
road was offered him he told the directors that 
he did not think himself the man they wanted, 
because he was known to be on the working- 
man's side and that was not the attitude they 
would expect in a railroad president. On the 
contrary, was the reply, that was just the reason 
they wanted him for president. And when 
his anti-Tammany activity as chairman of the 
famous Committee of Fifteen seemed likely to 
impair his practical usefulness in the great work 
of securing tunnel and terminal rights in New 
York for the Pennsylvania and the Long Island 
Railroads, he had his resignation all ready to 
send in to the railway officials ; in fact, it was 
sent in, but was refused, as we are glad to note. 

Baldwin's work for Tuskegee and for South- 
ern education in general, his exertions for 
tenement-house reform and for the lessening 
of the social evil, his service as Smith College 
trustee and as co-worker in countless good 
causes, as well as individual doer of many kind 
deeds unknown to the world, would by them- 
selves fill a volume. Professor Brooks has, 
naturally enough, chosen to dwell on his efforts 
and achievements as a broad-minded, far-seeing 
railroad man, as a student of the race question 
and an active worker for the improvement of 
the negro, and as a social reformer conspicuous 
in the many movements for weeding out the 
innumerable evils that rankly flourish in the 
administration of our municipal affairs. With 
Baldwin as his starting-point and returning- 
point, the biographer has made numerous excur- 



sions into domains familiar to him and inviting 
enough to the reader, but having little immediate 
connection with his main theme. For example, 
the chapters on "Trade-Unions," "Labor and 
Capital," and " Open or Closed Shop," though 
excellent and useful, and here and there show- 
ing where Baldwin stood in the larger concerns 
of his calling, do not contribute much toward 
filling in the portrait which the book is supposed 
to present of this singularly winning and gifted 
character. That he was richly endowed with 
other capabilities than those of a commercial 
and executive order, is made plain by the fol- 
lowing paragraph from his close friend, Dr. 
Samuel A. Eliot, quoted by Mr. Brooks : 

"What sensitiveness to beauty played about his 
strength! He sunned his soul in music. He could 
always sing well, and nothing gave him greater pleas- 
ure. He never had time for much instruction in music, 
but he could manage to play somehow on almost any 
musical instrument. If he had not been a railroad 
president I think he would have liked to be a church 
organist. He loved nature and enjoyed the perplexities 
and trials of a farmer's life. He could talk about soils 
and crops with the same buoyant enthusiasm as about 
subways or the great composers. He loved the bright 
laughter of little children, the flying cloud-shadows on 
his lawn, and the rush of the surf up the beach." 

As a lesson in civic righteousness, Baldwin's 
life, as told by Mr. Brooks, is most admirable ; 
and the tale is full of warm human interest, 
despite the social and economic disquisitions 
which have been interspersed and for which we 
are not ungrateful. Three portraits are pro- 
vided : of Baldwin the young college graduate, 
of Baldwin the man of thirty-six, and of Bald- 
win as he appeared in his last years. The book, 
dedicated "to the men and women of America 
in whose keeping lies the civic and business 
honor of the nation," is worthy of their careful 
reading. PERCY F. BICKNELL.

are but a remnant of the multitudes of their 
generation which came into the world. A simple 
calculation will demonstrate this, for if all the 
individuals of even the slowest breeding species 
were to survive, the world would be overstocked 
in a short time. In this game of life, with the 
odds so heavily against the individual, much de- 
pends upon success in eluding natural enemies. 
As the slayer sharpens his wits and claws, so 
must the slayee contrive new ways to escape 
him, or all is lost. Yet it is not quite correct 
to say "contrive," for usually no volition or 
deliberate intention is involved. It is simply 
this: through the continual destruction of the 
more easily detected individuals, in the course 
of ages, all variability in the direction of ineon- 
spicuousness is favored, with a final result which 
is at once the delight and wonder of anyone 
who will pay attention to it. 

To anyone who has seen a bird hunting in- 
sects, it may well seem that all the concealing 
coloration in nature, wonderful as it is, is really of 
no account. The robin on the lawn can find grubs 
enough for a full meal where I saw nothing. The 
predators get enough to eat, in spite of anything ; 
and what could they more ? Then again, some 
concealing devices are admittedly nearly perfect 
to our eyes, but what about the lesser degrees of 
inconspicuousness leading up to them ? Would 
they deceive anything? Would not the animals 
perish before they attained any sort of success? 

In answer to this, it must be recalled, in the 
first place, that in the long ages past the hunt- 
ers must have grown in skill, the ability to find 
and the ability to avoid being found developing 
in equal measure. In the second place, the 
important thing, after all, is usually relative 
inconspicuousness. A plate of peaches passed 
around the table, all of them in full sight, will 
sometimes illustrate the principle of natural 
selection. When food is abundant, as is com- 
monly the case, the predator will select, })erhaps 
unconsciously, the more conspicuous, other 
things being equal. Thus, when there is more 
than enough to go round, creatures which would 
be readily detected were they alone will escape 
amid the multitude of more noticeable or more 
attractive objects. 

The outcome is, that living nature abounds 
with disguises of every kind ; and there is no 
more fascinating occupation for the naturalist 
than to hunt these out, as they occur in every 
woodland or meadow, mountain or desert, and 
even in the great ocean. For the most part, 
these things are never seen, and so to many 
who read Mr. G. H. Thayer's new book on 



" Conceal ing-Coloration," there will IK? opened 
out a whole new world of wonder ami leauty. 
Tin* l>ook is l>ased primarily on the ideas of 
Mr. Abbott II. Thayer, who is well known as 
a skilful artist. In 1896 he published the 
important generalization which is now known as 
"Thayer's law," showing that nearly all animals 
are darker above than beneath, this difference 
very accurately balancing the amount of illumi- 
nation. By means of models he made it evident 
that if animals were merely "colored like their 
surroundings," they would be conspicuous !> - 
cause of the shaded under parts, but the actual 
difference of tint produces a nearly uniform 
effect which makes them "flat" and incon- 
spicuous. This common-sense suggestion was 
widely and favorably discussed, and it was 
remarked that it took the eye of an artist to 
fully appreciate the meaning of color in nature. 
After this success, Mr. Thayer and his son con- 
tinued to follow up the subject with enthusiasm, 
and as a result we have a large and beautifully 
illustrated book, written by the latter. In the 
Introduction, it is claimed that this whole sub- 
ject belongs properly to the arti>t. 

"The entire matter lias been in the hands of the 
wrong custodians. Appertaining solely to animals, it 
has naturally been considered part of the zoologist's 
province. But it properly belongs to the realm of 
pictorial art, and can be interpreted only by painters. 
For it deals wholly in optic.-il illusion, and this is the 
very gist of a painter's life. He is born with a sense 
of it; and, from his cradle to his grave, his eyes, where- 
ever they turn, are unceasingly at work on it, and his 
pictures live by it. What wonder, then, if it was for 
him alone to discover that the very art he practices is 
at full beyond the most delicate precision of human 
powers on almost all animals ? " 

The writer of this review, being one of those 
who are thrown out of court by the terms of 
this utterance, should perhaps be still ; but he 
will venture a mild protest. Were he an artist 
like Mr. Thayer, he would be tempted to ask 
the editor's permission to insert a cartoon repre- 
senting the new-born infant investigating optical 
i illusion. The truth is, that the painter is trained 
; to view color, form, light and shade, in a partic- 
ular way ; and there is no doubt whatever that 
he has a special outlook on the world for this 
reason. It may fairly be suggested, however, 
that all artists seek harmony and beauty, and 
are able to find it where others cannot. Is it 
not possible, therefore, that they sometimes sec 
too much, from the standpoint of the present 
investigation ? Predatory animals are not look- 
ing for color harmonies, but rather the reverse, 
and their whole training and point of view must 
be very different from that of Mr. Thayer.

It would take another book to discuss the 
facts in detail, but after prolonged considera- 
tion I can only conclude that the field is still 
open for a more critical and scientifically trained 
investigator. The authors appear to have such 
absolute faith in their own judgment, and so 
little regard for any other possible points of 
view, that they are not in the best position to 
do scientific work. One is continually reminded 
of Whistler's remark to Chase : " My dear 
Colonel, I 'm not arguing with you : I 'm telling 
you ! " In consequence they lead us to such ex- 
treme views that we are almost ready to believe, 
by way of reaction, that the whole thing is hum- 
bug. Every bird and every animal is assumed 
to be inconspicuous in its proper surroundings, 
and if it has any striking patches of color these 
are said to " cut up " its figure so that it looks 
like something else. No doubt there is some- 
thing in this ; but placing ourselves in the sup- 
posed position of a predator, we find that we 
are looking continually for something which, 
according to the hypothesis, we never see. We 
rather conclude that under the circumstances we 
should drop the psychological concept of what a 
bird ought to look like (how did we get it?) and 
begin to attend to actual appearances ! Perhaps 
the climax of our astonishment is reached when 
we come to some pictures of flamingoes. The 
red flamingoes match a brilliant red sky, at sun- 
rise or sunset, but the white species with a dash 
of red matches a white cloud, with a red sunlit 
one seen against it ! In general, in spite of 
artistic authority to the contrary, we are satisfied 
that the color-tones in the pictures are far too 
flat and uniform (e. g., plate xi.). This may be 
partly due to the method of reproduction, but 
we are invited to accept them as they stand. 

On the whole, it seems to me that the book is 
un suited for those who will use it uncritically ; 
but for those who care to study the phenomena 
it discusses, it will be helpful and instructive, 
and its very faults may then prove stimulating.

A GREAT AMERICAN EDUCATOR.* 

Of all recent biographies, one of the most 
interesting, especially in educational circles, is 
the Life of Daniel Coit Gilman, prepared by 
Mr. Fabian Franklin. Mr. Franklin under- 
took the work at the request of Mrs. Gilman, 
and himself wrote the last five chapters ; while 

*THE LIFE OF DANIEL COIT GILMAN. By Fabian 
Franklin. Illustrated. New York : Dodd, Mead & Co. 



in the first three, dealing with President Gil- 
man's career before the founding of the Johns 
Hopkins University, he edited chapters contrib- 
uted respectively by Mr. William C. Gilman, 
Miss Emily H. Whitney and her sister Miss 
Margaret D. Whitney, and Professor William 
Carey Jones of the University of California. 
The book thus has the unity of a single author's 
work, and the additional advantage that each 
period of Dr. Gilman's life is sympathetically 
presented by one who knew him at the time and 
could draw upon a rich fund of personal recol- 
lection. 

President Gilman was preeminently an edu- 
cational organizer and leader. His thought was 
often, indeed one might say usually, a generation 
in advance of the day ; but his effort was always 
practical. The keynote of his whole career is 
sounded in a letter that he wrote from Berlin, 
in 1854, when he was still undecided upon any 
definite course in life. 

" For some things, I rejoice to find that my notions 
grow more and more definite. For instance, in the 
desire to act upon the minds of men, to do my part, 
even though it may be but little, for the elevation and 
improvement of such society as my lot may be cast in. 
It seems to me that I care less and less for money and 
for fame, but I do desire to use what influence I can 
for the establishment of such ideas as seem to be im- 
portant and right. Whether this be done by the voice 
or the pen, or by both, whether in the pulpit or in the 
college, in the editor's chair or the office of a common 
school superintendent, cannot perhaps for many years 
be decided." 

Truly this was an ideal of unusual maturity 
for a young man of twenty-three, and it was in 
holding to this ideal of helpful service for more 
than fifty years that his greatness consisted. 

Mr. Gilman was born July 6, 1831, and 
graduated from Yale in the class of 1852. In 
December of the following year he and his life- 
long friend, Dr. Andrew D. White, sailed for 
Europe as attaches of the United States Legation 
at St. Petersburg. The next two years were 
spent partly at the Russian capital, partly in 
study and travel. In 1855 he returned to New 
Haven and became assistant librarian, subse- 
quently librarian, at Yale, a position that he 
held for the next ten years. Prior to 1859 he 
also acted as school visitor, when his efficient 
service in introducing the graded system and 
written examinations in the grammar schools 
led to the appointment of the first Superintend- 
ent of Public Schools in New Haven and the 
establishment of a high school. These were 
formative years for the modern system of edu- 
cation, and the ideas he advocated at that time 
are worth noting. In a pamphlet on " The 



36 



THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



Idea of the Graded School " he not only pre- 
sented the advantages of the system, but in urg- 
ing the cultivation of habits of clear thinking and 
close observation he advocated a more careful 
study of English and the use of simple geo- 
metric figures with elementary drawing. These 
ideas have in large measure been realized in 
recent years in all our better schools. Unfor- 
tunately, his notion that the cultivation of the 
voice in speaking is more important than in sing- 
ing has not as yet found general acceptance. 

With the passage of the Morrill Act, Mr. 
Oilman interested himself in securing its bene- 
fits for tbe Scientific School already established 
at Yale. He was appointed Professor of Physi- 
cal Geography in 1863, and for the next nine 
years proved himself not only an exceptionally 
inspiring teacher, but in his administrative work 
as secretary of its faculty he was largely instru- 
mental in securing endowment and so shaping 
policy that the " step-child " of Yale became 
the Scheffield Scientific School. It was at this 
time, partly by force of circumstances, that he 
worked out the idea of the "group system," an 
idea that later proved of the utmost value to the 
universities that he directed and to educational 
policy in general. 

In 1865 Professor Gilman resigned his posi- 
tion as librarian, because he could see no pros- 
pect of obtaining adequate funds for either books 
or administration. It is an interesting commen- 
tary on progress in library affairs to note that 
the library at Yale was then open but five hours 
daily, was housed in a building practically 
unheated, and that students desiring to borrow 
books were required to pay a fee for each 
volume taken out. It is pleasant to add that, 
largely through Mr. Gilman's influence, the 
reforms that as librarian he had been unable to 
obtain were soon secured. 

In the spring of 1866 Mr. Gilman prepared 
the first annual report of the State Board of 
Education. Many of the ideas he then advanced, 
especially regarding the consolidation of small 
school districts, the care of vicious and backward 
children, and cooperation between the schools 
and colleges, though now generally considered 
necessary, are not yet carried through ; indeed, 
they are often regarded as among the most recent 
notions in educational development. 

Between 1865 and 1872 Mr. Gilman, though 
devoting himself primarily to the duties of his 
professorship, gained a wide reputation as a 
man fitted to be the executive head of a large 
university. In 1870 he was called to the presi- 
dency of the University of Wisconsin, and a 



few weeks later to that of the University of 
California. He was also prominently mentioned 
as the successor of President Woolsey ; but for 
election at his alma mater he was too much of 
a man of the " new education." What would 
otherwise have been the result, is an interesting 
but fruitless query. 

In 1872 came a second call to the University 
of California ; and now family considerations 
led him to accept. Space forbids any extended 
notice of the work done by him during the two 
years that he held the position. It must, how- 
ever, be said in passing, that the time was a 
critical one in the development of the Univer- 
sity, and that to President Gilman is due the 
credit of establishing its entire freedom from 
the control of party politics in the legislature, 
and also of securing the fund that has made the 
Lick Observatory its astronomical department. 

With the founding of the Johns Hopkins 
University, in 1874, Mr. Gilman was elected to 
the presidency, and charged with the task of its 
organization and the selection of its faculty. 
It is worth noting that the Trustees, before 
making their choice, had sought the advice of 
the Presidents of Harvard, Cornell, and Mich- 
igan, and each of them had immediately named 
Mr. Gilman as the man best fitted for the posi- 
tion. His wise and tactful administration made 
the Johns Hopkins foundation the first real 
American university. To give an adequate 
description of the influence he exerted in this 
way would be to write the history of American 
graduate study, and would include the biogra- 
phies of many men now prominent in academic 
work. As a well-known educator recently re- 
marked, no small part of President Oilman's 
best service was in recognizing young men of 
extrordinary ability and setting them at research 
work. In this connection may be mentioned, 
from a far longer list, the names of Henry A. 
Rowland, C. K. Lanman, Ira Kemson, and 
Sidney Lanier. The early courses of lectures 
that the most eminent men in various lines, 
among them Lowell, Cooley, Walker, and Child, 
were invited to deliver, also did much to create 
a university atmosphere. Thus from the vory 
first, through the philosophical faculty that 
President Gilman gathered around him. the 
ideals of scholarship and scientific research 
that characterized the German universities were 
established for this country. 

In laying the foundations of the Medical 
School at Johns Hopkins, President Oilman 
also set a standard that, in the words of the 
present Dean of the School, constitutes - his

second great contribution to the educational 
development of this country." For various rea- 
sons, the Medical School was not established till 
seventeen years after the University opened its 
doors. President Oilman had, however, antici- 
pated it from the very beginning, and with the 
prevision of a great leader had insisted upon a 
high standard of preparation and professional 
attainment. At that date no medical school in 
America demanded even the preparation needed 
to enter the freshman class of any reputable 
college. But President Oilman felt that a col- 
legiate degree should be demanded, and that the 
work leading to it should be chosen with special 
reference to fitting the candidate for his subse- 
quent professional study. Natural sciences, the 
modern languages, psychology, and ethics, were, 
he felt, indispensable subjects ; and an attempt 
was made to provide such a course. What he 
wanted is well indicated by his sympathy with 
the jesting suggestion of a friend that the course 
should lead to the degree of F.S.M. (fit to study 
medicine). In working toward his ideal, the 
first biological laboratory in America had been 
established when the University opened, and 
Dr. H. Newell Martin (a pupil of Huxley's) and 
Professor William K. Brooks had been called 
to the Chairs of Physiology and Morphology. 
Their teaching attracted to the University many 
brilliant students whose names are now widely 
known. In 1884 Dr. William H. Welch was 
appointed Professor of Pathology, as that seemed 
to be the next scientific chair demanding an 
experimental laboratory and yet distinct from 
the Hospital. The latter was entirely independ- 
ent of the University and had a distinct Board 
of Trustees, but Johns Hopkins had expressly 
demanded that it should ultimately form a part 
of the Medical School. With the completion 
of their buildings the trustees of the Hospital 
proposed to begin the work of medical instruc- 
tion. To this, President Oilman was unalter- 
ably opposed. Such instruction, he felt, should 
be in intimate relation to the other chairs and 
faculties of the University. Fortunately his 
view prevailed, and the two Boards of Trustees 
united in the appointment of Dr. Osier as chief 
physician, Dr. Halsted as chief surgeon, and 
Dr. Kelley as gynaecologist, at the Hospital, 
each receiving a corresponding title at the Uni- 
versity. The Medical School thus constituted 
was opened in 1893. It was and is a graduate 
school in the sense that it accepts as students 
only college graduates. It thus appears that the 
words of Dean Howell, quoted above, are fully 
justified by the facts ; for though other causes 



have contributed to raise the standards of medi- 
cal education in this country, none has been 
more potent than the high ideal proposed and 
attained by President Oilman. 

Space forbids any further discussion of this 
most interesting biography. President Oilman's 
activity in civic affairs, in the work of organized 
charity, and especially his share in devising and 
setting in motion the machinery of the Carnegie 
Foundation, must be passed without mention. 
But it is not fair to conclude without a brief 
word concerning the letters that are included in 
the volume. In them the personal side of Dr. 
Oilman's life and work is well presented. They 
show him as a sincere friend, a devoted husband, 
a considerate and tender father and brother. In 
his selection of this material Mr. Franklin has 
shown admirable judgment and taste. Enough, 
but not too much, is given. The book is inter- 
esting, inspiring, and thoroughly satisfactory. 
It forms a notable contribution to American 
biography. LEWIS A. RHOADES. 



THE MASTERS or PROSE IN AMERICA.* 

Mr. William C. Brownell's volume on the 
masters of prose in America is a notable addi- 
tion to the books of criticism that are not to 
be lightly glanced at and laid aside. These 
six essays first saw the light in " Scribner's 
Magazine," and are now reprinted with slight 
modifications. Mr. Brownell holds a place of 
importance among English-speaking critics. 
His work on the Victorians was discriminating 
and enlightening; if he did not say the last 
word on the subject (fortunately no one can), he 
considerably advanced the discussion. At least 
the same is true, we think, of the present work. 

His method is commendable. He subjects 
each author to close scrutiny with reference 
to substance, aim, culture, and style. He 
detaches himself as carefully as possible ; he 
represses, for the most part, his own feelings ; 
his criticism is the result not of feeling but of 
conviction. His standards are uncompromi- 
singly high. His conclusions are invariably 
stated with due modesty ; he never suggests the 
attitude of ipse dixi. For him the adjudication 
of a writer's place or achievement is no easy task. 

For Cooper, Mr. Brownell makes large claims, 
and accords him, relatively, the highest praise of 
all the writers he considers. Cooper's Indians 
are ably defended ; his women are affirmed to

Emerson, Poe, Lowell, Henry James. By W. C. Brownell.

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



be, on the whole, well drawn. Incidentally 
Mr. Brownell severely handles the provinciality 
of New England in the second quarter of the 
nineteenth century. No doubt New England 
was provincial ; yet it may be seriously ques- 
tioned if Cooper's own provinciality was not in 
some respects nearly as great. Certainly it 
was not a time of large and catholic views in 
either politics or religion, in New York or in 
New England. 

In estimating the worth of criticism, the 
temperament of both the critic and the author 
criticized must be taken into account. Mr. 
Brownell disparages Hawthorne more than any 
of the others. Is he temperamentally fitted to 
estimate the work of Hawthorne? To recur to 
our last paragraph, does he understand the New 
England of which Hawthorne was the flower ? 
Beyond "The Scarlet Letter," he will allow 
little good in all that Hawthorne wrote. His 
novels " have not the reality of novels." " The 
House of the Seven Gables" is, " if not the least 
characteristic of Hawthorne's larger productions, 
at least that in which the characters have the 
slenderest interest, the most shadowy outlines " 
(p. 870). Not many will concur in this. The 
" Tales," though original, refined, and elevated, 
are nevertheless pronounced mediocre (p. 75). 
" The Wonder Book " and " Tanglewood Tales " 
"have only a juvenile appeal." The signifi- 
cance of " The Marble Faun " is " entombed 
rather than exhibited in its treatment " (p. 86). 
Finally, Hawthorne " had very little to brood 
over " (p. 107). We should be disposed to think 
he had a good deal. Mr. BrownelTs theory is 
that Hawthorne allowed his fancy to develop at 
the expense of his imagination. This theory 
may have led its champion to conclusions that 
will not find general acceptance. Take, for 
example, " The Marble Faun." Must the failure 
of this story, so far as it can be said to have failed, 
be attributed to the play of fancy (e. g., about 
Donatello's ears) indulged at the expense of the 
imagination (<.//., as regards the effects of sin 
upon the three characters) ? It seems doubtful. 

Equally questionable in some respects is the 
conclusion about Emerson. It is quite true that 
Emerson's appeal is primarily to the mind ; it 
is not quite so clear that he " deifies intellect." 
To quote one or two sentences : 

"His deification of intellect, indeed, inevitably in- 
volves a corresponding deficiency in susceptibility, and 
defective sympathies are accordingly and were as a 
matter of fact with him as characteristic of Emer- 
son's order of moral elevation as is this one enthusiasm 
to which his susceptibility limited him" (p. 147). . . . 
" Professor Woodberry . . . maintains that Emerson is 



essentially religious. I cannot myself see it. Perhaps 
it is a question of definition, but surely it is an accepted 
idea that religion is a matter of the heart, and one is 
confident that no religious or uther emotion ever seri- 
ously disturbed the placid alternation of systole and 
diastole in Emerson's " (p. 150). 

But is religion so much a matter of the heart 
rather than of the head ' \\V have the authority 
of a respectable writer that ** as a man thinketh 
in his heart, so is he." And when our critic 
affirms that Emerson's idealism was " as hostile 
to the essence as to the ecclesiasticism of Chris- 
tianity " (p. 169), the reply must be that this 
depends upon what is meant by the essence of 
Christianity a meaning which it ought not to 
be difficult to-day to ascertain. 

Of Foe, Mr. Brownell perhaps asks too much. 
What he seems to ask for is that Poe should 
have dealt with other materials of life with the 
same skill with which he handles the gruesome 
and the horrible. This is as if one were to 
quarrel with a great painter for not being as 
great a sculptor. It must, of course, be granted 
that Poe is sometimes too self-conscious ; that 
too often his attitude is that of the fat boy 
announcing to his auditors that he is going to 
make their flesh creep. The fact is, that very 
frequently Poe does this, just as he promised. 
With regard to Poe's alleged unscrupulousness 
(p. 223f.), one may admit that he reveals a 
greater lack of conscience than many others, 
but need not go to the length of calling him a 
liar. And when he is mentioned in the same 
breath with Mandeville and Miinchausen (p. 
223), the result is, we think, misleading. Even 
Mandeville was not exactly lying, in the strict 
sense ; he was writing fiction for a credulous 
age. Poe wrote for a different kind of public, 
and was perfectly well aware of its nature. 
Finally, in saying that as literature Poe's writ- 
ings " are essentially valueless " (p. 262), does 
not our critic champion an extreme view ? 

In our way of thinking, the chief defect of Mr. 
Brownell 's criticism is a slight lack of sympathy. 
'Does he not now and then fail to consider all 
the circumstances of intention, environment, the 
limitations imposed by early training, and the 
like? The possibility of this, at least, recurs 
persistently. His style, too, at times lacks 
lucidity. Two examples of this may be quoted. 
He has been speaking of Lowell's wide reading 
and the charge that Lowell lacked scholarship : 
" Not a scholar! Le moye/i, as the French say, 
for such a tremendous bookman not to be " 
(p. 295). Again, of Hawthorne : " Something 
seems distinctly left out of his organization 
that particular faculty whose function it is to

make the most of its fellows " (p. 97). Admit- 
ting that the sense of these passages can be 
made out, one may still affirm that they fall 
short of Quintilian's ideal, that it shall be 
impossible to mistake the sense. One finds, 
moreover, too many French quotations. The 
English language may be limited ; one begins, 
however, to doubt if its limitations are as pro- 
nounced as is implied by so frequently resort- 
ing to another speech. 

We repeat, however, that Mr. Brownell has 
made a distinct contribution to the discussion of 
several matters vitally important for the growth 
of American literary art. His method is the 
only safe one, and most of his conclusions will 
commend themselves to thoughtful readers. In 
his hands the art of criticism is exemplified as a 
dignified form of activity, worthy of the ablest 
minds. CLARK S. NORTHUP. 



RECENT FICTION.* 



The conception of human society which is crystal- 
lized in the terrible phrase of Hobbes, homo homini 
lupus, is presented with force and conviction by 
Mr. Robert Herrick in his latest novel, "A Life for 
a Life." The conception is an inadequete one, and 
only embittered souls will adopt it as a working 
formula; but most of us fall at times into the mood 
which it fits. Certainly the gospel of success, as it 
is both preached and practiced in our country at the 
present day, gives much countenance to the view 
that the chief end of man is to prey upon his fellow- 
man, and that the kind of life commonly held most 
desirable is to be gained only at the cost of the 
crushing of weaker lives. That great numbers of 
men have in view a higher end than this, seeking a 
life that is not built upon the wrecked happiness of 
others, we profoundly believe ; and the fault of

Mr. Herrick's picture is that it is painted in colors 
too black to be representative of the whole of life. 
This, it will be remembered, was the conspicuous 
fault of his treatment of the marriage problem in 
' Together." But indignation sometimes rises to 
such a flood as to sweep away all the sober counsels 
of reason ; and it is in this heightened temper that 
Mr. Herrick has penned his diatribe against the 
heartless and frenzied commercialism of our time. 
His method is that of Isben, although he has little 
of Isben's technical skill, and the idealist, passionate 
and far from hopeless, may be discovered below 
the pessimistic surface of his presentation. He is 
obsessed by the notion that great individual wealth 
must needs be ill-gotten, in defiance of the moral 
law ; and therein he allies himself with the sensa- 
tionalists who in the cheap magazines appeal to the 
meanest passions of their readers. What we now 
most need in dealing with the ominous problem of 
plutocracy is a constructive philosophy which shall 
distinguish between honest and dishonest fortunes, 
which shall be as zealous in its defence of the 
former as fierce in its denunciation of the latter, and 
which shall lead an attack, not upon the institution 
of private property in general, but upon the forces 
of privilege and corruption that now work such 
unquestionable injustice between man and man. 
Such books as " A Life for a Life," with all their 
admirable indignation and powerful pleading for a 
higher morality in the world of affairs, simply play 
into the hands of the socialists, the realization of 
whose aims would be the end of all civilization. The 
machinery of Mr. Herrick's novel is fairly conven- 
tional until near the close, when it becomes simply 
fantastic. His hero, a foundling, grows up in the 
country, and then comes to the great city to make 
his way. He wins a measure of success under the 
patronage of the magnate who gives him a start, and 
whose daughter he dares to love. But as his eyes 
become opened to the conditions under which success 
of this kind is achieved, he determines to renounce 
all that he has gained even the love that is his 
for the asking and cast in his lot with the people. 
The climax of the story comes with an earthquake 
which lays the great city in ruins, and in which the 
hero gives up his life. The moral is found in this 
comment of a friend : " To break the circle of ideas 
that dominate men that was what Hugh Grant 
believed must be done. The vicious circle was 
broken here for thousands by an act of supreme 
force from without. But it must be done singly, 
individually, each with himself and those nearest 
his influence. The great end cannot come through 
political action, by theory or programme, by any 
division of the spoils, any readjustment of laws, but 
only by Will the individual good will to renounce, 
working against the evil will to possess." Powerful 
as this work undoubtedly is, and deserving to be 
treated with the utmost seriousness, it must never- 
theless be urged once more that it is a biased pro- 
duction, and is devoid of any gleam of geniality.

THE DIAL 



[July 16, 



Mr. Herrick's sympathies are intense bat narrow ; 
we hope that in time they will become more com- 
prehensive. 

Absolute originality of plot is probably an ideal 
henceforth unattainable by the writer of fiction, but 
a refreshing degree of originality is still sometimes 
achieved, a notable recent example being found in 
"The Wild Olive," by the author of that rather 
tricky success of last year, "The Inner Shrine." 
In his new novel, Mr. Basil King, who now seems 
to be credited with the authorship, certainly pro- 
vides us with a fresh and piquant opening. A 
fugtitive from the law, already sentenced to death 
for murder (of which of course he is innocent), is 
hunted through the Adirondack wilderness by the 
officers from whom he has escaped. Hard pressed, 
he takes refuge in a lonely cottage, which turns out 
to be the summer home of the judge who had 
passed sentence upon him. A young woman with 
Indian blood in her veins (the judge's ward) takes 
him under her protection, hides him for some weeks 
in a secluded studio, and arranges for his final 
escape by way of Lake Champlain, the St. Lawrence, 
and a transatlantic steamer. He is provided with 
money, clothing, and a new name, all of which he 
takes with him, first to England, then to the 
Argentine, where he obtains employment, receives 
rapid promotion, and achieves a successful business 
career. The closing section of the story brings him 
back to New York, and at the same time entangles 
him in a love affair. This confronts him with the 
moral problem of his assumed name and anomalous 
legal position. He decides that he must make a 
clean breast of it and take the consequences, which 
prove to be the loss of his bethrothed (who is a 
shallow creature after all), and the realization that 
his destined companion is no other than the young 
woman to whom he has all the time been indebted 
for his new start in life. His name is cleared soon 
after he has resumed it. and the complication works 
out to a satisfactory conclusion. It makes a strik- 
ingly interesting story, and a much better one than 
its predecessor. 

Mr. Will Levington Comfort pulls the strings of 
international politics to very lively effect in his 
stirring romance, " Routledge Rides Alone." It 
seems that a British officer in India was guilty of 
an indescretion in his frontier operations a good 
many years ago, and became responsible for the 
massacre of a number of Afghans. The matter was 
hushed up, and the Afghans, ignorant of the offence, 
remained on friendly terms with the British and con- 
tinued to serve in their useful capacity as a buffer 
against Russian aggression. But the facts were at 
last betrayed to Russia by an Irish newspaper cor- 
respondent, whose hatred of England amounted to 
fanaticism. Then there was much excited con- 
sultation in the Foreign Office, and a frantic 
effort to seek cover ; for the revelation meant that 
Russia would invade India with the connivance of 
Afghanistan. Nothing but a coup would save the 
desperate situation, and when this was decided upon 



it took the form of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance 
which startled the world a few years ago. Tluu 
the war between Japan and Russia was precipitated, 
and the threatened invasion of India averted. Upon 
this historical basis, partly real and partly imagined, 
Mr. Comfort has built an impressive story of love 
and war, of intrigue and adventure, that has an 
unusual degree of interest. The hero Routledge is 
a sort of free lance among correspondents, and his 
exploits are the wonder of the profession. He is a 
friend of the Irish traitor, and the lover of Noreen, 
the Irishman's daughter. Returning to England 
when excitement over the betrayal runs highest in 
the secret councils of the Empire, he finds himself 
accused of the infamous deed, and ostracised by 
society. Learning that his Irish friend is the one 
who is really guilty, he rejects the opportunity thus 
offered to clear his own name, and bears all the 
burden of obloquy, sustained only by Noreen's 
unswerving belief in his innocence. Then he dis- 
appears, becomes an American correspondent in 
Manchuria, and wins new professional laurels. He is 
finally rehabilitated through Noreen's efforts, after 
her father has made a death-bed confession. This 
should make a good story, judging from the outline 
alone ; it makes, in fact, one of the best stories of 
its kind that we have ever read. The comparison 
with Mr. Kipling's work is inevitable; and .Mr. 
Comfort does not suffer in the comparison. His 
work is tense, virile, and deeply informed. More- 
over, it has a distinctive style, which is as far as 
possible removed from the banal or commonplace, 
and may be exemplified by a bit of introspective 
musing in which the hero indulges. " Which is 
better, a gaunt, hungry, storm-bitten wanderer, with 
his face forever at the fire-lit window-panes of civili- 
zation, or a creased and cravatted master of little 
ceremonies within ? A citizen of ordered days and 
nights, or an exile with the windy planet forever 
roaring in his skull?" The work remains closely in 
touch with actuality throughout, yet it is shot 
through with imaginative gleams, and tinged with 
the mysticism that is justified by its oriental set- 
ting. In characterization it is swift and incisive; 
it has in Routledge a very proper hero, and in 
Noreen the kind of heroine that it is good to dream 
about. 

They call him " Collars-and -cuffs " because he 
wears clean linen in a community that affects to 
despise such evidences of civilization. He is the 
new superintendent of one of the toughest divisions 
of a railway in the Southwest. When he starts 
upon his job, he finds lawlessness and insubordina- 
tion everywhere, his authority uixK-nnined, and his 
life in constant danger. He has accepted the post 
with reluctance, because he believes himself to be a 
coward, having in his consciousness the dishearten- 
ing memory of a hold-up in which he did not meas- 
ure up to his own standard of manliness. What 
makes the matter worse is that his failure to rise to 
that perilous occasion has discredited him in the 
eyes of the young woman upon whom he has fixed

his affections. But he is persuaded to test himself 
once more, and assumes the command of the desper- 
ate situation to discover, when the crisis comes, that 
his cowardice is only superficial, that it is of the panic 
sort which threatens to overwhelm for a moment 
but loses its terrors when he gets what he calls his 
" second wind." Thus he redeems himself after all, 
in his own eyes and in those of the heroine, who is 
conveniently present (looking through a crack in 
the door) at the psychological moment. All of this 
is related with verve and realism in " The Taming 
of Red Butte Western," by Mr. Francis Lynde. 
The book is an acceptable successor to " The King 
of Arcadia," which acquainted us with a not dis- 
similar set of conditions and collection of types. 
Both books have a close grip upon Western life, are 
condensed in description and natural in dialogue, 
and bear a sharp message of implied rebuke to all 
mollycoddles. 

An impoverished Virginia plantation is the scene 
of " The Scar," by Mr. Warrington Dawson. The 
characters are the widowed owner struggling to 
keep a roof over the family, her two sons, a few 
neighbors, and a vain and selfish young woman who 
first makes a visit and later comes to stay, having 
infatuated one of the sons and made herself his 
wife. The time is the present. Out of these 
materials the author has made a story of moderate 
interest, photographically true in most, matters of 
detail, but far from successful in its attempt to 
realize and make consistent all of the leading fig- 
ures. The best delineation in the book is that of the 
mother, hardened and embittered by her struggle 
with poverty, and implacable in her resentment 
toward the woman whose entrance into the family 
she considers a bold and designing intrusion. This 
woman, who becomes morally guilty of her hus- 
band's death, is afterwards mated to a man who is 
almost as wobbly as herself in his moral standards, 
and the prospect of a hardly deserved happiness 
faces them at the close. It is a rather depressing 
book, and its execution falls far short of its artistic 
intention. 

Mr. Oppenheim's novels are so much alike that 
the same formula will do fairly well for any of 
them. They are ingenious in plot, swift and varied 
in action, and are written with the superior air of 
one who has access to the penetralia of high society 
and high politics. " The Illustrious Prince " is one 
of the best of them, and keeps the reader alert. It 
is a story of international intrigue, and the "Prince" 
is a secret agent of the Japanese government who 
is also one of the wiliest of criminals, shrinking 
from no means that fit his ends.' His sojourn in 
England is for the purpose of advising his govern- 
ment as to the desirability of renewing the English 
alliance, and his decision turns upon the discovery 
that the voyage of the American fleet is not the veil 
of a sinister design to make an attack upon Japan. 
When he is at last enmeshed in the network of his 
own crimes, he permits an underling to assume all 
the guilt (after the approved fashion of Japanese 



patriotism), and gets off scot-free. He is an en- 
gaging rascal, and we do not altogether regret the 
outcome. 

A young woman connected with the circus, a pro- 
fessional dompteuse with bronze hair, a seductive 
voice, and languorous feline grace, ensnares a gilded 
English youth whose star is rising above the politi- 
cal horizon. She has a shady French husband 
somewhere adrift in the world, but does not think 
it worth while to mention the fact. Her victim is a 
nice boy, brought up according to the strictest prin 
ciples by a sternly virtuous mother, who is naturally 
horrified when she learns that her son has succumbed 
to the wiles of the enchantress. The youth is secre- 
tary to Simon de Gex, M.P., and to the latter the 
mother turns for help in her perplexity. Simon con- 
sents to interview the siren, and thus we have pre- 
pared for us at the outset all the elements needed for 
a pathetic story of the Camille-Sapho-Zaza type. The 
story is called " Simon the Jester," but its author, 
Mr. William J. Locke, is more of a jester than his 
hero, and gives the situation a whimsical twist which 
has some startling consequences. Simon is in a 
peculiar fix. He has a " pain inside " which the 
physicians have diagnosed as the sign of a fatal dis- 
ease, and he has been given six months, more or less, 
to live. His problem is to decide how to conduct 
himself during this short shrift, in order that he 
may make a self-respecting and dignified exit from 
the stage. Taking a hint from Marcus Aurelius, he 
decides to devote his remaining days to the cultiva- 
tion of " eumoiriety," which means " the quintes- 
sence of happy-fatedness dealt unto oneself by a 
perfect altruism." The appeal made by the boy's 
mother fits very well with this plan of deliberate 
altruism, and so he makes the acquaintance of Lola 
Brandt with the most disinterested of intentions. 
But fate plays him the trick of substituting a new 
victim for the old one, and the young woman soon 
makes it evident that she has transferred her affec- 
tions to her altruistic visitor. At this point, in order 
that the story may proceed without unduly ruffling 
our emotions, we are made to understand that we 
have been wholly mistaken in the young woman, 
who is no mercenary adventuress, but a very pattern 
of all the virtues and a paragon of womanly loveli- 
ness. This is a pretty predicament for Simon de 
Gex, M.P., with six months, more or less, to live. 
He has already cut himself off from political life, 
and squandered most of his fortune to help a dis- 
tressed friend all in his pursuit of eumoiriety. 
Now it becomes his hard task to respect the conven- 
tions, suppress his personal feelings, and reunite 
Lola with her lost husband. The scene then changes 
to Algiers, where the husband is discovered, more 
disreputable than the wildest imaginings had pic- 
tured him; but he is neatly despatched by the aveng- 
ing blade of a queer Greek dwarf, an exhibitor of 
trained cats, whose devotion to Lola is of the fanatic 
sort. Then Simon falls into the hands of a French 
surgeon, who performs upon him a miraculous 
operation, with the result that the menace to his 



42 



[July 16, 



life is removed, and he is restored to the prospect 
of rounding out a normal existence. He returns 
to England, but is almost penniless as the conse- 
quence of his eumoirous proclivities, and, being 
preceded by the scandal of the taking-off of the 
undesirable husband and the magnified tale of his 
reputed relations with the widow, finds himself 
ostracised. But Lola is faithful to him, and his love 
for her triumphs over all obstacles even over the 
difficulty offered by the mutilation of her face at the 
claws of an enraged cat (the Greek dwarf's legacy). 
He marries Lola, goes in for settlement work, and 
presumably lives happily ever after. This truly 
delightful tale is by no means represented by such 
a summary as we have attempted ; its chief charm 
is found, not in its invention, but in its quiet humor 
and deft allusiveness. It provides a worthy succes- 
sor for "Septimus" and "The Beloved Vagabond," 
and " The Morals of Marcus Ordeyne." 

" The Street of Adventure," by Mr. Philip Gibbs, 
is a tale of Fleet Street which is another way of 
saying that it is a tale of the life of the London 
journalist. It begins with an account of how the 
hero seeks and finds a job on "The Star" (called 
"The Rag" by its familiars), proceeds with the nar- 
rative of his reportorial trials and triumphs, and 
ends not nicely finished off, with wedding belli 
in the last line, as all good stories should" but 
in abrupt and inconclusive fashion, although the 
wedding bells are at least a possibility of the future. 
It is a very human and natural and intimate story, 
brightened by quiet humor and softened by tender 
sentiment, a story of varied and picturesque in- 
cident, and no plot worth mentioning. The staff 
of " The Star " constitute an interesting family of 
distinctive personalities, and we get an effect closely 
akin to tragedy when the group is broken up as 
the owner's willingness to ' put up " ceases and 
the paper ends its existence. The atmosphere of 
London journalism seems to be sufficiently like that 
of its American counterpart to make the book, even 
in its slighter humors and accidents, easily intelligi- 
ble to American readers. 

Another story which has no plot to speak of, but 
is packed with interesting incidents, and is clearly 
a direct transcript of life, is Mr. M. Little's At 
the Sign of the Burning Bush." It is a story of 
three Scotch divinity students, their struggles and 
vicissitudes, their successes and failures. They are 
characterized for us in very lifelike fashion, and 
we are given a truly photographic picture of their 
existence at the various stages of their careers 
:i picture from which no detail is thought too petty 
for exclusion. It is a humdrum and uneventful 
sort of life with which the book acquaints us, but of 
its essential truthfulness we are never in any doubt. 
If the young men with whose professional fortunes 
we are here concerned do not answer to our precon- 
ceived and conventional idea of what Scotch minis- 
ters are like, they are at least authentic examples of 
humankind, as are also the women folk with whom 
they are associated by the ties of blood or friendship. 



Hut if the tone of present-day ecclesiastical circles 
in Scotland be fairly represented in this work, the 
modern departure from its traditional zeal and aus- 
terity is certainly surprising. 

After a long silenc*-. .Mr. Hcnryk Si.-nkirwitv 
gives us " Whirlpools," a novel of contemporary 
Poland, added to the group which already includes 
"Without Dogma" and "The Children of tin- Si.il." 
Unfortunately, the tried translator of his other n<>v< U 
is dead, and the new work has fallen into the hands 
of a literary journeyman whose intentions may be 
of the best, but whose performance is stiff and un- 
gainly. The translator's only idea of dealing with 
an idiomatic or picturesque phrase is to put it into 
bald and literal English, leaving the reader to puz- 
zle out the meaning as best he may. Aside from 
this handicap, the new work presents itself to us as 
a rather labored effort to give organic sliape to a 
great mass of undigested material. It has to do 
with the socialistic and agrarian unrest of the pres- 
ent time, and the confusion of unbalanced counsels 
among the men who should be the leaders of the 
race. The author himself does not seem to have a 
definite programme or an orderly system of ideas ; 
and this, at least, is to be expected from one who is 
as bitterly satirical and as destructively critical as 
he. His hero is a weak but generous-hearted aris- 
tocrat who in his boyhood had seduced a peasant 
girl upon his estate. The girl reappears many years 
after, having lived for a long time in England, where 
she has been adopted by a wealthy man of affairs. 
She is now a highly educated woman and a consider- 
able heiress, and her betrayer meets her as a new 
acquaintance, having no idea that he has ever seen 
her before. Her charm captivates him, and he 
becomes her declared lover, only to be confronted 
with the revelation of her past. For a time he is 
dazed, for such a marriage would be a serious busi- 
ness in that society of caste and prejudice ; but his 
love is such that he still resolves to take the step. 
But the woman is too proud to accept the alliance if 
he is to make any mental reservations ; he fails in 
the test, through his inherent weakness of character. 
So the story ends dismally enough, and the close is 
made even gloomier by the accidental death of a 
young girl who is a sort of secondary heroine a 
bright and beautiful creature who falls an accidental 
victim to mob violence. The philosopher who, like 
a Greek chorus, comments upon the whole tragic 
perplexity, thus voices the message of the work : 
"Whirlpools! and of sand! Sand is burying the 
whole of Poland and transforming her into a wilder- 
ness, in which jackals live. If this is so, then it 
would be best to put a bullet in the head." But yet 
She lives in every one of us, in all of us together, 
and will survive all the whirlpools in the world. 
And we will set our teeth and will continue to suffer 
for Thee, Mother, and we and if God so wills it 
and our children and grandchildren will not renounce 
neither Thee nor hope." With this faintly qualified 
outburst of pessimism the story ends.

BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS. 



Fervently as English gardeners may 

bless the memor y of the late F : w .- 

Meyer for setting forth the possibili- 
ties of " Rock and Water Gardens " so sensibly and 
alluringly, Americans will find in his book far 
greater reasons for according him their gratitude, 
since on this side of the Atlantic almost nothing has 
been done in the field he chose for his own. A sin- 
cere student of nature in "her more artistic aspects, 
with a knowledge of soils and stones equalled by 
his knowledge of the needs of the infinite variety 
of plants that have an affinity for rocky or watery 
places, Mr. Meyer studied out the best possible way 
of bringing these together so as to make art forget 
itself and nature seem supreme. With great care 
and patience he has shown us how a rock-garden or 
a water-garden, or a combination of the two, should 
be planned and built in a manner to convert the 
barren horrors of an ordinary " rockery," or a pool, 
into a congenial home for a vast number of beautiful 
and interesting plants. A stretch of old retaining- 
wall of stone was his delight, and reach a of time- 
worn brick-work meant such opportunity as he 
loved ; but lacking these, he told us, cheerfully 
enough, how to go to work with new stones and fresh- 
burned brick to lay walls that shall vie with those 
in interest. The American gardener is always 
seriously handicapped by the climate of our arid 
summers, our late and inconstant springs, and our 
early frosts ; and for him there is no " Heath 
Garden " such as is described in the chapter added 
by Mr. Dallimore of the Royal Gardens at Keu. 
Otherwise there is much in this charming volume 
to stimulate and encourage plant-growers in this 
country. It is published in the attractive " Country- 
Life Library " of Messrs. Scribner's Sons. 

A handbook Comparatively few readers or tourists 
of English have very clear ideas of what consti- 

Cathedral*. tute8 a Cathedral church in England, 
or what reasons there may be for the existence of 
the ecclesiastical establishments thus designated. 
Miss Helen Marshall Pratt anticipates the publica- 
tion of a promised series of monographs, and in a 
comprehensive volume of less than six hundred pages 
gives an admirable guide-book to " The Cathedral 
Churches of England " (Duffield), valuable not only 
to those who are fortunate enough to take it in hand 
and visit the various Cathedral towns, but also to the 
many who must travel abroad in library chairs. A 
proper sense of proportion and a systematic arrange- 
ment characterize the book. All the Cathedral 
churches of England are not of like interest. A 
page each suffices to record all that need be said 
of the Cathedrals of the modern sees of Truro, 
Wakefield, Birmingham, and Manchester ; and as 
Westminster Abby was a Cathedral for ten years 
only in the middle of the sixteenth century (a fact 
usually overlooked by writers) it receives no atten- 
tion whatever. The introductory chapters give much 



information in condensed form about the Cathedral 
establishment and officers, the Cathedral fabric, 
architectural styles, stained glass, and practical 
suggestions ; and the thirty-two Cathedrals are 
separately treated in the alphabetical order of the 
Cathedral towns. St. Paul's Cathedral under this 
arrangement is treated in its proper place as the 
Cathedral church of the see of London. The classi- 
fication of the Cathedrals into those of the Old 
Foundation, of the New Foundation, and of the 
Modern Foundation, is the best that could be made. 
The book gives useful and interesting lessons in 
ecclesiastical and architectural history and church 
polity. The popular glossary furnishes a further 
fund of architectural and antiquarian lore. 

The many readers of Professor 
SoS^M^'S^iler Mathews will probably agree 

that this is his most interesting and 
helpful book. It has more than a transient value, 
but it is eminently timely. It is a sound piece of 
Christian apologetic, positive, practical, persuasive. 
Its pages are not strewn with theological compost 
or littered with the dry bones of Gospel criticism, 
but the reader is impressed constantly with the fact 
that behind every statement there lies not only a 
serious purpose but an adequate scholastic equip- 
ment. These affirmations respecting the paramount 
value of religion, the permanent importance of the 
gospels, and the supreme significance of Jesus, all 
these declarations carry the implications of mature 
reflection and mastery of the topics discussed. Thi 
is a strong, sane book, which ought to be widely 
read. The author faces the difficulties of our modern 
situation with clear insight and perfect frankness ; 
and he shows with literary skill and convincing logic 
that while some old notions must be abandoned, the 
essential facts and forces of historical Christianity 
not only remain untouched by destructive criticism 
but issue from this searching examination with 
increased beauty and power. Of the ten chapters, 
those on "Jesus the Christ" and "The Power of 
the Social Gospel" are peculiarly attractive and 
helpful. ( Macmillan ) . 

The father Professor Werner Sombart, the emi- 

of scientific nent Berlin sociologist is quoted as 

socialism. saying that Karl Marx has "drawn 

a great deal of strength from the fact that he has 
so frequently been misunderstood." Just in what 
degree wrong inferences from his teaching have 
strengthened him, may be an open question ; but 
there is no question that both his followers and his 
enemies contradict each other amazingly as to 
fundamental points of his doctrine. Under the cir- 
cumstances, Mr. Spargo's admirably lucid, direct, 
and unimpassioned life of Marx ( B. W. Huebsch) is 
helpful to those who already have some knowledge 
of the father of scientific socialism, although it is at 
the same time sufficiently elementary to serve as a 
starting-point for a study of the great German's 
doctrines and work. Mr. Spargo is a socialist, but

THE DIAL, 



[July 16, 



he is not a fanatic, and his book is a frank picture 
of an irascible, frequently intolerant, and sometimes 
unfair propagandist, but a fundamentally honest 
and devoted reformer, whose work, though full of 
errors and inconsistencies, nevertheless compassed 
the organization of "the greatest political movement 
in history." If Marx contradicted himself, he did 
so, we are told, because he was constantly reaching 
new and broader points of view, as every progressive 
thinker must do ; if some of his contentions have been 
disproved and some of his prophecies have failed, the 
class-struggle is moving toward a crisis substantially 
as he foresaw it, and there is at least a possibility 
of the triumph of the cooperative movement which 
he so confidently predicted. The volume is more 
than a socialistic appeal, it is a carefully-made con- 
tribution to biographical literature, an appreciation 
of the work of a man who was a poet before he was 
a philosopher, and a pathetic account of a life of 
heroism and suffering which was closely linked to 
other beautiful lives. A chapter devoted to a detailed 
analysis of "The Communist Manifesto," another 
handling the epoch-making treatise on Capital." 
and a final chapter entitled " His Achievements," 
make up the philosophical part of the volume, and 
form an adequate statement of Marxian doctrine 
and influence. 

It is an odd combination of poets that 
Professor Woodberry has brought 
together as exemplifications of poetic 
energy in his volume on "The Inspiration of Poetry " 
(Macmillan). Three English Marlowe, Gray, and 
Byron ; one Portuguese Camoens ; one Italian 
Tasso ; and one Latin Lucretius, each displays 
some phase of emotion. Marlowe's emotion was 
"an aspiration of all the faculties, the individual 
making out toward the infinite in all ways," since he 
was a true child of the Renaissance in its yearning 
for the impossible. Gray, who on the whole is 
treated rather apologetically, displayed the emotion 
of those who saw the new light of the romantic move- 
ment, for he discovered the romance of primitive 
literature and felt the love of wild and majestic 
scenery ; there may not be much poetic madness in 
the " Elegy," but there is in " The Bard." Byron's 
passion burst forth in his practical enthusiasm for 
political liberty, so that he became for England the 
voice of the French Revolution; his poetic energy 
lay there much more than in his personal discovery 
of the romance of the Orient and of the sentiment 
of history in landscape. Camoens saw the world in 
the sixteenth century, when Portugal was penetrat- 
ing every sea, and thus became the "poet of world- 
discovery." Tasso, who lived during the Catholic 
Reaction and does not therefore represent in Italy 
A time of pulsing passion, wrote a poem which is 
marked by emotion divorced from action, mere feel- 
ing. In his poetry," says Professor Woodberry, 
" art is seen on the way to music "; and this being 
to, Tasso is not, we should say, a good illustration 
poetic energy marking an emotional upheaval of 



the race. To speak of him as "tin- fort-runner and 
prophet of the age of music soon to dawn after him " 
is to confuse the functions of the poet and the IIMIH- 
cian. Lucretius stood in the dawn of scientific 
reason," and he conceived of his subject in terms of 
poetry ; he had a consuming passion for truth, and 
a heart pledged to the service of his race. To say 
with Professor Woodberry that of the above poets 
" each represented some mood of the world at a 
culminating point, and with intensity," exceeds our 
courage ; but we can say that they display poetic 
energy with an intensity born of their genius and 
their time. 



,, ami reamer, mystic, seer of visions, 

of a philosopher, vagabond, and artist to 
vagabond poet. his finger-tips, Mr. O'Dermid W. 
Lawler (if that be his real name) presents in auto- 
biographical form a strange and engrossing record 
of things experienced and imagined during a life- 
time outwardly obscure and even commonplace, but 
lived with an intensity and fashioned with an arti-tir 
touch that make it a thing curiously attractive if not 
wonderful to contemplate. " East London Visions " 
(Longmans) is the book's title, and the characters 
introduced and scenes depicted are of the humble 
sort, but all infused with life and reality by the 
narrator's magic skill. Although a sentence in the 
preface explains that " the significance of the story 
with its visions as here printed will . . . best be 
understood when it is considered as an Essay in 
Values, an attempt to show the supremacy of the 
Christian Religion, though not as commonly under- 
stood," nevertheless the tone of the book is by no 
means didactic or homiletic ; the purpose is far from 
being tiresomely in evidence. The Celtic strain in 
the narrator's composition, derived from a father 
who is depicted as a character of extraordinary force 
and originality, accounts for much of the peculiar 
pathos and humor in the book. Let a fragmentary 
specimen of the author's style be here introduced. 
Recalling his childhood days he writes: " Boys 
then had advantages : there was no electric light. 
Candles and rushlights revealed imineasureable 
values in interiors, faces, forms, which the electric 
light kills. The candles had smouldering wicks. You 
could blow them out, and then blow them in again. 
The old nurse Grigsum frequently did it. in the 
interval* of her boisterous fairy stories." Further 
chapters from this same oddly interesting life are 
half promised. As a happy blend of fact and fiction. 
poetry and philosophy, romance and realism, the 
book possesses unusual attractions.

matter to publish, should there be a call for it.

To collect cosmogenetic myths of ludian tribes who 
have not advanced so far in civilization as to lose their 
memory of the folk tales of their race, is a fascinating 
pursuit of the scientist, to which Dr. Clinton Hart 
Merriana has yielded with the result that we have, 
added to his innumerable books and papers on zoolog- 
ical and botanical subjects, " The Dawn of the World " 
(A. H. Clark Co.), a collection of " Myths and Weird 
Tales told by the Merwan Indians of California." The 
primary purpose of the book is to present these stories 
as a contribution to scientific ethnological and mytholo- 
gical knowledge and folklore. But a popular character 
is given to the tales ; and the illustrations furnished by 
distinguished artists, some of them in color, make the 
presentation especially rich and interesting. 

The new edition of " Who's Who in America " for 
1910-1911, edited by Albert Nelson Marquis and pub- 
lished by Messrs. A. N. Marquis & Co., is now at hand. 
This edition may be said to mark the tenth anniversary 
of the founding of this invaluable publication, the first 
volume having been issued in 1899; and it is inter- 
esting to note that, starting with 870 pages, the work 
has grown until it now contains 2,648 pages, or nearly 
three times the original number. In his preface the 
editor states that the labor pertaining to the prepara- 
tion of this edition for the press has been much greater 
than for that of any previous one, owing to the fact 
that practically every sketch has been rewritten since 
the 1908-9 issue. Much new material has been added, 
making in all a total of 17,546 sketches, of which 
2,831 are entirely new. 

It is not easy to see just what purpose is served by 
Mr. Milton Bronner's book on Maurice Hewlett (John 
W. Luce & Co.). A meagre biography, bald summaries 
of certain stories, and commonplace remarks on each 
published work, make up the volume. Mr. Hewlett's 
works are not so difficult of assimilation that they 
require to be done up in predigested tablets for the 
benefit of intellectual dyspeptics. Anyone who does not 
feel more comfortable after reading one of Mr. Hew- 
lett's charming stories than after going through Mr. 
Bronner's book about them had better consult a special- 
ist. Books on books are worth while only when they 



add to the reader's intelligent comprehension of the 
books criticised or drive him with enthusiasm to read 
and study them himself. The thin criticism and the 
fulsome praise of this volume have produced, it seems 
to us, exactly the opposite effect. 



NOTES. 



"The English Moral Plays," by Dr. Elbert N. S. 
Thompson, is a monograph published under the auspices 
of Yale University as an issue in the series of " Transac- 
tions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences." 

" Writings on American History," compiled for the 
year 1908 by Miss Grace Gardner Griffin, is the third 
annual volume in the important bibliographical series 
to which it belongs. It bears the imprint of the Mac- 
millan Co. 

A new volume in the " University Studies " issued 
from the institution at Urbana is provided by Dr. Louis 
John Paetow's study of The Arts Course at Mediaeval 
Universities, with Special Reference to Grammar and 
Rhetoric." 

"An Explorer's Adventures in Tibet," by Mr. A. 
Henry Savage Landor, is a retelling for young readers 
of the story of the author's famous journey made in 
1897. The book has many pictures, and is published by 
the Messrs. Harper. 

Professor Walter Raleigh's introduction to the 1905 
edition of Hakluyt (MacLehose) is now reprinted in a 
volume by itself under the title of " The English Voy- 
ages of the Sixteenth Century." It is a brilliant esssay, 
well deserving of this separate publication. 

Richard Wagner's polemical essay on " Judaism in 
Music," both the original of 1850 and the supplement 
of 1869, is translated into English, with introduction 
and notes, by Mr. Edwin Evans, and the book is 
imported by Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons. 

The " Physical and Commercial Geography " which 
has resulted from the collaborative efforts of Professor 
Herbert E. Gregory, Albert G. Keller, and Avard L. 
Bishop, all three members of the Yale faculty, is a short 
volume of text (with a few illustrations) designed for 
the use of college students. Messrs. Ginn & Co. are the 
publishers. 

An interesting little book published by Messrs. Ginn 
& Co. for the International School of Peace gives us a 
translation of " The Great Design of Henry IV." from 
Salby's memoirs, and Edward Everett Hale's essay on 
" The United States of Europe," written in 1871 for 
" Old and New." The volume is edited by Mr. Edwin 
D. Mead, who contributes a historical introduction. 

Dr. Lewis Henry Haney's " Congressional History 
of Railways in the United States to 1850 " was pub- 
lished two years ago as a doctoral thesis by the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin. The author has since continued the 
work to cover the period 1850-1887, and the second 
volume, even bulkier than the first, is now published by 
the University. The two sections together constitute a 
monograph of over six hundred pages. 

In commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of 
the " Harvard Monthly," it has been thought wise to 
illustrate the literary quality of that example of college 
journalism by publishing a volume of " Selected Poems " 
that first appeared when their authors were under- 
graduates. Thirty-six writers are represented, among

them the well-known names of Mr. George Santayaua, 
Mr. Bliss Carman, Mr. Edwin Arlington Robinson, Mr. 
William Vaughn Moody, Mr. Philip Henry Savage, 
Mr. Joseph Trumbull Stickney, and others almost as 
familiar to the general reader. We doubt very much 
if any other of our universities could make such a 
showing as this. 

Two briefly annotated and otherwise commendable 
book-lists have recently been issued by the Seattle 
Public Library, one of them being " A Last of Books 
for Teachers in the Seattle Public Library " (the books, 
not the teachers, are there to be found, we infer) ; the 
other, " A Brief Descriptive List of Books with Sug- 
gested Outline of Study " on the subject of the " Pacific 
Northwest." These lists were prepared by members of 
the library staff. 

Dr. William J. Rolfe, a distinguished educator and 
Shakespearian scholar, died at Tisbury, Mass., July 7, 
at the age of eighty-three. He was born in Massachu- 
setts, was educated at Amherst College, and spent the 
most of his life in his native State, mainly at Cambridge, 
lie was a teacher in his earlier years, and was the first, 
it is said, to introduce the systematic teaching of En- 
glish literature in the schools of this country a work 
for which he deserves lasting commemoration. He 
edited, with critical notes, many editions of standard En- 
glish works among them an edition of Shakespeare in 
forty volumes, which are said to have had an enormous 
sale. The list of publications to his credit make an 
extensive catalogue. Dr. Rolfe wrote much on literary 
and critical topics, and was an always welcome contrib- 
utor to THE DIAL.

The One Indispensable 

Medium for Publishers 

of Worthy Books 

'"THIRTY years of continuous publi- 
cation under the same management 
speak for THE DIAL'S stability and 
success. It is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the inter- 
ests of the book class, the literary 
and cultivated class, the class that buy 
books. It is issued from the second 
largest city in the country, the centre 
of the immense book-consuming region 
of the Middle West. 



HTHE DIAL is more generally con- 
sulted and depended upon by 
librarians in making up orders for 
books than any other American critical 
journal; it circulates more widely 
among retail booksellers than any 
other journal of its class; it is the 
accustomed literary guide and aid of 
thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country. 



T^HESE facts make THE DIAL indis- 
putably the foremost medium for 
high-grade advertising, the one 
indispensable medium for the publisher 
of worthy books. 



1910] THE DIAL, 51 

A Really Remarkable Book 

FIRST NOVEL OF YOUNG WRITER EXCITES 
ADMIRATION OF THE HIGHEST CRITICS 



BEST BOOK is not necessarily the best seller. 
"Predestined," a novel of New York life, by Stephen 
French Whitman, now in its third edition although not a 
best seller yet, is pointed out by the best judges of fiction those 
both acute and sincere as fiction of highest merit and deep signifi- 
cance. Are not these opinions guarantee of a novel's excellence : 

" Excluding the work of these masters (William Dean Howells and Henry 
James), we are of the opinion that this is the most important book of the sort 
written by an American in the last twenty years." New York Evening Sun. 

"From every point of view it is one of the most interesting pieces of 
fiction produced by an American in many years." - Collier's Weekly. 

"' Predestined ' is a 'big thing,' an overwhelmingly big thing. It 
might almost claim to be called a great novel." -New York Tribune. 

" Mr. Whitman has treated a dangerous theme with delicacy and strength. 
It is realism with restraint and human sympathy, and on the whole gives a juster 
and more vivid picture of certain aspects of life in New York's ' tenderloin ' 
than does any other novel we can recall." New York Evening Post. 

"The descriptions of places, people, and incidents in the story are 
accomplished with great understanding and skill. An excellent piece of 
work." New York Sun. 

" If it is a first novel it is a surprisingly good one a portrayal of char- 
acter both vivid and penetrating, a study of realism shot through with poetic 
glints." The Dial. 

These papers as everyone dealing with books will tell you are 
influenced by no consideration but that of actual worth. They see 
a book's substance, and, however distasteful to those interested, tell 
the truth about it. On their word you can depend: so, when next 
you want a deeply interesting narrative which is at the same time a 
significant comment upon life, get "Predestined. 11

THE ARCHITECTURAL BACKGROUND 
OF LITERATURE. 

Nature and Humanity are the terms of litera- 
ture, but there is a third factor which has grown 
to great proportions. This is the architectural 
background ; that part of nature which man has 
infused with his own spirit, and uses as a nest, 
a refuge, and a fortress. Unlike the snail and 
tortoise, he does not carry his house upon his 
back ; but in some measure, like them, he secretes 
it from his own nature. It is his second skin 
the vestiture he places between himself and the 
world. The colder or more varied the climate, 
the closer does he hug to this outer weaving, 
the more intimate his relations are to it. In a 
region where people live in the public square, 
where a man can wrap himself in a cloak and 
sleep under the foliage and stars, houses have 
not much importance in life or in its reflected 
mirror of literature. Existence in Greece and 
Italy was existence in the open air; and so it 
was with literature. The walls of Troy, the 
tents and ships of the Greeks, the palaces of 
Ulysses or Alcinous, are briefly indicated in com- 
parison with the wealth of detail which a north- 
ern writer would have expended upon them. 

The forms of architecture show this differ- 
ence in interest. Architecture for the Greeks 
was for the gods and rulers. It was an affair 
of state, a comparatively outward thing, upon 
which, indeed, all taste and cost might be 
expended, but which was not the intimate life- 
expression of northern races. The Greeks stuck 
four posts in the ground, put a roof over them, 
and were content. The lines of the Parthenon 
are duplicated in the first barn or Quaker 
meeting-house one comes to. Accepting the 
laws of equilibrium so simply, they were free to 
expend their whole energies on the casing of such 
a shell; could carve and paint and decorate. 
Gothic architecture, on the contrary, is a pro- 
test against the laws of gravitation. It gives 
wings to stone, turns timber to cloud. It is a 
prayer, an agony, a dream. All this is not to say 
that, architecturally, it is better than the Greek 
style. Indeed, as architecture is a material art, 
the physical perfection of the Greek may consort 
with its end and aim better than the spiritual 
aspiration of the Gothic. But the last is more 
individual, more steeped and dyed in human 



54

feeling. And it has reacted upon literature to 
an enormously greater extent. Buildings and 
houses in the North have become the persons of 
the drama. Heine imagined a scene where all 
the cathedrals of Europe should be gathered 
together on a vast plain, and a quarrel should 
arise among them, and they should rush on each 
other in awful combat. And one can shut one's 
eyes and call up an endless procession of the 
houses of men rebuilt by words in modern lit- 
erature. 

The line would begin away back with Asgard, 
the home of the gods, whose building calls the 
curse upon them ; and with Walhalla, where the 
Valkyrie maidens bring the slain warriors to 
revive and quaff their mead in endless feast. 
Then there is Brunhyld's home, and the Hall 
of Etzel where occurs the most prodigious 
slaughter in fiction. And there is Conor's 
palace at Emania, whither D&rdre comes to 
die. But these are mythological and heroic 
habitations ; .and it is not until we come to 
Chaucer that we get down to the earth, and 
have houses with chimneys and fireplaces, 
abodes where it snows of meat and drink. 
Spenser is of the South, or of some No Man's 
Land. His house is out of doors; he has a 
passion for gardens and " salvage wilds "; it is 
only now and then that he dashes in a vignette 
of some hut or hermitage or hall, " seated in 
hearing of a hundred streams," where real peo- 
ple would want to dwell. 

In the printed drama, the architectural in- 
terest is of course skeletonized. Such scenic 
directions as " a room in a palace " or " before 
the altar in a church " are bare bones from 
which one can extract little nutriment. Yet 
by hints and indirections, by the issue of the 
actions, the Castle of Macbeth looms sombre 
and gigantic, the most tremendous projection of 
its kind. And the Palace at Elsinore, seen at 
first with glimmering lights through the dark- 
ness, denoted by the salvo of cannon which 
hails the revelry of the King, fills the imagina- 
tion. The Tower of London broods over and 
dominates a succession of Shakespeare's histori- 
cal dramas. The late Richard Mansfield felt 
this so keenly that in his production of Richard 
III." he opened with a silent scene which 
merely showed the huge mass of the fortress 
where so much of the interest of the play cen- 
tres. In Belmont, Shakespeare is Italian, but 
he gives the place a touch of home enchantment 
which probably no Italian poet could have 
equalled. And he contrives also to make the 
cave in "Cymbeline," Miranda's home in " The 



Tempest," and Duke Theseus's palace, instinct 
with the same charm. 

The pseudo classical eighteenth century was 
a homeless one, at least in literature. Nobody 
seemed to be impressed with the poetry of 
houses; sermons in stone did not sink into the 
mind of that light, frivolous, social age. The 
influence of buildings is a romantic power, and 
only when the Romantic revival hove in si^ht 
did it come into its own. The " Mysteries of 
Udolpho" is really an epoch-making work in 
this respect. Here again was the subtle domi- 
nation or alliance of architecture and action. 
Cowper, in " The Task," sang the home, its snug- 
ness and comfort ; and Burns rescued the humble 
cottage for poetry. From the despised, rejected 
Defoe, we get what is almost the most notable 
instance of the significance of home-building. 
The fascination of u Robinson Crusoe," I think, 
arises from the fact that it shows the whole 
genesis and growth of man's necessary shelter. 
We see the human animal putting this together, 
bit by bit, furnishing it with needed implements, 
foraying forth from it in search of food. There 
is nothing in the work but the absolutely ele- 
mental facts of existence. 

Sir Walter Scott gathered all the Romantic 
threads into his single hand, and the architec- 
tural background thrusts forward prodigiously 
in his pages. From Roslyn Castle, Fair Mel- 
rose, the Hall of the Last Minstrel, to Baron 
Bradwardine's house, and Ravens wood and 
Kenilworth and Woodstock, he has a long suc- 
cession of houses whose facades or interiors echo 
and complete the human action. 

But it was reserved for later Romance writers 
to carry the architectural theme to its limit. 
Victor Hugo deliberately made Notre Dame 
the central personage, the protagonist of his 
novel. Hawthorne, in " The House of the Seven 
Gables," essayed the same theme on a lesser 
scale. Balzac and Dickens are almost more the 
historians of houses than of humanity. In the 
Alkahest of the former, the house and its fur- 
niture are as much alive as the people. And 
Dickens seems to have tried to body forth all the 
picturesqueness and gloom of London, all the 
quaintness and charm of English villages. 

There attaches to houses and buildings where 
men abide, first the property feeling, the feeling 
which each individual has that such an alxxle 
is his seat and throne, "a poor thing" perhaps, 
but their own. Then there is the sense of se- 
clusion, of privacy, of a circumscribed world. 
Catullus, always curiously modern and roman- 
tic, has an exquisite touch, where, after wander-

ing over many seas, among many people, he 
returns to his peninsula abode at Sirmio and 
stretches his limbs upon his own couch and 
feels the luxury of home. 

This little universe of the house has its central 
sun in the fireplace. The hearth has always 
been a superstition with the Aryan race. We 
are all fire- worshippers. A good part of the 
Vedas is devoted to the ritual of the hearth-fire. 
The home too is, or was until recently, the 
peculiar province of woman. It might be dis- 
courteous to call her the moon which revolves 
around the sacred hearth, and perhaps in sum- 
mer when the fires are out, or in steam-heated 
apartments, she must herself be all the warmth 
and light. Men, with their glowing cigars or 
puffing pipes, are the stars and clouds of this 
little world. The idea of food, too, attaches to 
the house. We can, of course, eat out-of-doors ; 
but eating as a fine art suggests a house with the 
accompaniments and conveniences that pertain 
thereto. What a frame is to a picture the walls 
and windows of a room are to such a festal 
site. Perhaps such restriction concentrates and 
intensifies nearly all human actions, which is 
one reason why modern writers show such a 
preference for interiors. 

It is hardly an over-fanciful idea that the 
walls of buildings may absorb, and give out 
again in influence, the actions, dramas, sorrows 
or felicities which may have occurred within 
them. Ghosts certainly belong almost exclu- 
sively to houses, or have but a tethered pastur- 
age outside. In Bulwer's extraordinary story 
of " The House and the Brain " we get the con- 
ception of a whole building plastic and pliant 
as it were to the evil will of a long-dead occu- 
pant. Secret passages, disused and mouldering 
chambers, dungeons, treasure closets, ruins, 
have all proved valuable assets in literature. 
In the latter part of the eighteenth century 
there was a great run on ruins, but they have 
rather gone out of fashion despite this pictur- 
esqueness and imaginative associations. Of 
course the other side of architecture its 
beauty, grandeur, charm, and convenience 
have all been exploited in poetry and fiction. 
The stately homes of England, in Mrs. Hemans' 
phrase, live in a thousand word-pictures. We 
have them all on our imaginary visiting-list : 
Darcy's fine mansion, which turned Elizabeth 
Bennet to marry him ; Esmond's Castlewood, 
Peacock's Headlong Hall or Crochet Castle, 
Shirley's house, Wuthering Heights, and many 
more whose precincts have been our haunts of 
pleasure or of wonder. 



The Inn is the house raised to the nth power. 
It offers the unexpected and the piquant, 
comfort without care, company without respon- 
sibility, variety without dulness. Meals simply 
happen ; they come at the clapping of our 
hands. And adventures occur without the 
trouble of seeking them. As a consequence 
literature is crowded with inns ; its pages reek 
with the savory smoke of their chimneys, glow 
with the rich light of their fires, echo with the 
clatter of their dishes, the voices and laughter 
of their guests. All inns in literature have 
some merit, even the scurvy Spanish inn of 
Don Quixote. But French and English inns 
are best. Those of Chicot and Dom Modiste, 
of D'Artagnan and his friends, of Scott and 
Dickens, are delightful enough to draw back 
translated spirits from heaven. The greatest 
of all in the whole range of fiction is the Boar's 
Head Tavern, Eastcheap, whether Shakespeare 
or Goldsmith invites us over its threshold. 
There is a passage in one of Hazlitt's essays 
which seems to me to express the inn feeling at 
its perfection. After a long summer-day's 
walk, he has arrived at a country inn and 
ensconced himself in the cosy coffee-room looking 
out on an old garden. The supper, though sim- 
ple, is good, and he has a volume of Congreve 
in his pocket, upon whose glittering prose he 
regales himself by way of dessert. Never, he 
says, did he feel the charm of literature and of 
life to a greater degree. 

It would be invidious to say nothing of the 
lodgings and chambers where so many good 
fellows, poets, artists, soldiers, men of leisure, 
the gay rattling advance-guard of each genera- 
tion, have made their first stand in the fight for 
place and fortune. The roll-call of such lodgers 
of literature would be longer than the catalogue 
of the Ships ; but Tom Jones, Thaddeus of War- 
saw, Nigel Olifaunt, Warrington, Pendennis, 
Mr. Pickwick (young at least in spirit) , Marius 
and Our Boys, rise to mind. And the prisons or 
sponging-houses where so many of these heroes 
temporarily bring up ought not to be neglected. 
Nor should the cloister cells of colleges, where 
they have their larvae state before they spread 
their splendid butterfly wings, go without men- 
tion. 

We are not altogether lacking in antiquity 
.in America, but as a rule we are so furious in 
rebuilding that we do not let our houses acquire 
the mellow crust of age, the traditions, memories, 
ghosts, which would make them serviceable to 
literature. And we march over so vast an estate 
that our architecture is more puzzling than pic-

turesque. One difficulty with our architecture is 
the varying climate with which we are endowed ; 
a building which is suitable for our winter is 
ridiculous in our summer, and the reverse. But 
we are gradually emerging from architectural 
chaos, and doubtless literature will follow on 
and decorate our homes with the wreathed 
trellis of a working brain." 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE POBT-DKEAM OF A WORLD-REPUBLIC of a 

war less and strifeless time presaged in Tennyson's 

lines from " Locksley Hall," when 

"The war-drums throb no longer, and the battle-flags are 

furl'd 

In the Parliament of Man, the Federation of the World ; 
There the common-sense of most shall hold a fretful realm 

in awe, 
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapp'd in universal 

Law," 

this poet-dream finds a peculiar echo in some words 
of Bjdrnson, uttered twenty years ago in a conver- 
sation lately reported by Mr. James W. M. Hall 
of Cambridge: "One of these days, I think Scan- 
dinavia and the United States will be one Grand 
Republic, and possibly England, too." And now it 
appears that no less a dignitary than the King of 
Italy is reported to have made, in a recent interview 
with Mr. Maxim Gorky, the following profession 
of republicanism: "If the people want a monarch, 
let them have one. If they want a republic, well, 
let them have it But what I want is the United 
States of the World. There should be one President 
of the World, to be elected once every five years." 
Perhaps some might think the term proposed too 
petty for a scheme so grand, and that the Mexican 
method of having a President for life affords a more 
likely model ; yet this is a detail to be adjusted 
later. The main thing now is to find the Man, the 
Great One who is to serve as President of this 
World Republic. There is not long to wait: voices 
innumerable are eager to shout his name over the 
roofs of the world, but let royalty here have pre- 
cedence. All eyes in this great world-convention 
are fixed on the Italian King, as he points impres- 
sively to " the most commanding personality of his 
generation . . . Theodore Roosevelt" Ah ! of 
course it was inevitable ; " the greatest man in 
the world," as a prominent Englishman (Sir Joseph 
Dimsdale) is reported to have called him in a pub- 
lic address, should certainly be at the head of the 
World Republic. Holland, the home of so many of 
Mr. Roosevelt's progenitors, is all ready for him. 
"If the Dutch people could vote," declares a re- 
turned traveller, " Roosevelt could be elected i 
of Holland.'* In his own land, the endorsements 
are of course too many and too vociferous to quote; 
but we will give one, from Dr. Rockwell D. Hunt 
of California, which touches our fancy by its elo- 



quence and sincerity: "Theodore Roosevelt is the 
greatest of living men, the ' most startling character 
since Napoleon.' . . . The conditions are perfect; 
the hero of San Juan and the Peace of Portsmouth, 
in the midst of his matchless powers, is henceforth 
called to serve humanity by accepting the post never 
before proffered to mortal man President of the 
United States of the World." What more is there 
to say? By all means, let us have the U. S. W., 
with Roosevelt as ruler, 

Till the ironclads are scuttled, and insurgents' flags are f url M 
In the Parliament of Man, the Great Republic of the World . 
There the sight of the Big Stick shall hold the fretful realms

While the great World Boanerges smites the universal jaw. 



LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT FROM YEAR TO YKM; 
cannot now be expected to show any startling leaps 
and bounds of progress. The library, like the 
school, the university, the hospital, or the public 
park, has long ago passed its experimental stage, 
and now settles down to long centuries (as we hope) 
of usefulness and honor. The late annual gathering 
of librarians at Mackinac Island was well attended, 
and was undoubtedly stimulating to all present ; 
but no epoch-making acts or decisions, no world- 
awakening speeches, no debates or momentous 
issues, made it of preeminent importance in the 
series of annual conventions, now thirty-two in num- 
ber, that have helped to establish the dignity and 
weight of the American Library Association as a 
national institution. We have learned, in the course 
of the customary addresses and discussions, that the 
paper on which our daily news is printed is of so 
perishable a nature that in half a century those 
journals that are now being bound for preservation 
will be crumbling to dust not the greatest imagi- 
nable loss to literature, yet one that might be pre- 
vented if newspaper publishers were actuated more 
largely by altruistic motives. Dr. E. C. Richardson 
of the Princeton University Library was appointed

rians at Brussels in August, and other delegates will 
be selected to accompany him. At the election of 
officers for the coming year Mr. J. I. Wyer, Jr.,

Albany, was chosen President, an honor to which his 
intelligent activity in library affairs entitles him. 



THE FLUENCY OF MR. CHESTERTON'S PEN. which 
has long astonished the world and alarmed the wise 
ones among his well-wishers, is daily becoming more 
astonishing and more alarming. His latest book, 
" What's Wrong with the World," which we may be 
pardoned for feeling reasonably sure will not have 
any appreciable effect toward righting it, is to be 
followed by a work on William Blake, a life of 
Hood for the "English Men of Letters" series, and 
a fantastic novel of the same character, we infer, as 
" The Man Who was Thursday." Truly, this bright 
young man is making a fine harvest of royalties

while the sun of popular favor shines on him. But 
the writing of four books a season, or even one book 
a month, loses something of its amazing quality 
when one considers how much of this facile output is 
merely a variation on a few ever-recurring refrains, 
whose hypnotizing note will be recognized in the 
following from the above-mentioned latest book : 
" How can it be a large career to tell other people's 
children about the rule of three, and a small career 
to tell one's own children about the universe ? How 
can it be broad to be the same thing to everyone, 
and narrow to be everything to someone?" As a 
maker of pert paradoxes, Mr. Chesterton has a facil- 
ity that comes from practice ; but we think others 
could turn them out almost as well at a pinch. For 
example, What difference does it make whether 
the world seems upside-down to three-quarters of 
the human race, or three-quarters of the human 
race take an upside-down view of the world ? With 
what reason do we complain that there are only 
three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days in 
the year, and sigh with impatience for the coming 
of the millennium? And, finally, Why should 
people relish the warmed-over platitudes of Mr. 
Chesterton, and yawn over the aphorisms of Martin 
Tapper? . . . 

THE RECREATIONS OF LIBRARIANS ought to lie as 
much as possible outside the world of books and 
catalogues and dating-stamps and charging systems, 
and all the rest of the paraphernalia of their pro- 
fession. It is pleasant to note the round-table dis- 
cussion, conducted by Librarian Ranck of Grand 
Rapids at the late annual A. L. A. Conference at 
Mackinac Island, on the subject of desirable recrea- 
tions for those of his calling. Various sorts of 
sport and exercise were wittily treated, and in so 
appreciative a manner as to prove that the librarian, 
however learned and dignified, is yet a human being. 
Not that we do not still have with us the old-school 
guardian of books who asks for no amusement more 
wildly exciting than is furnished in the pages of a 
trade catalogue or a bibliography. In fact, we have 
in mind one of this sedate and book-learned school 
of librarians who finds in the daily round, the com- 
mon task, all he needs or asks for. But all work 
and no play makes the librarian a dull pedant, and 
modern library methods and ideals call for workers 
of a different sort. 

THE UNRECOGNIZED DISCOVERER OF THE TEM- 
PLE LIBRARY AT NIPPUR, Dr. John Henry Haynes, 
who recently died broken-hearted and worn out by 
the long and a crimonious dispute ( in which he took 
no public part) over the famous find, addressed a 
few words of modest self-justification, before his 
death, to his friends in western Massachusetts, 
through the columns of a North Adams journal. 
He says, among other details concerning the work 
of the expedition under his charge : " The collection 
here referred to as the ' Temple Library ' was dis- 
covered after a long-continued, earnest and pains- 



taking search for tablets, when suddenly, and much 
to my surprise, I came upon the 'library,' which 
was found at a depth of eighteen feet in about one- 
half dozen rooms. That the complete collection 
was secured is clearly proved by the fact that the 
exploration of the surrounding rooms and buildings 
revealed no further trace of tablets or any kind of 
inscription. . . . The best years of my life have 
been freely and fully given to the prosecution of 
the work, as a sacred mission and trust. No per- 
sonal interests have been allowed to conflict with its 
duties or detract from its results. I have no apology 
to offer to anyone for facts herein given to the 
public, and only regret the necessity for correcting 
misapprehensions of facts in a work dearer than all 
else in my life." This death-bed utterance should 
prove convincing and final. Personal acquaintance 
with Dr. Haynes moves us to present his case and 
to hope that the honors withheld in life will now 
be accorded him after his lamented death. 

THE LURE AWAY FROM THE LIBRARY, which has 

caused so notable and universal a decline in circula- 
tion statistics, and to some extent in library attend- 
ance, is made the subject of a little symposium 
conducted by that alert and interesting monthly, 
"Public Libraries." " Good times " and the moving- 
picture show are almost unanimously held to be 
among the chief causes of the decrease in the de- 
mand for books. One correspondent, who fails to 
see why the decline should be so marked in the 
juvenile department of libraries, is answered that 
" good times " mean more nickels for the children 
to spend at the peep-show, and hence fewer hours to 
devote to reading. Another writer asserts that 
the automobile is responsible for this slighting of the 
library ; and it is not hard to admit that the man 
who, with begoggled eyes, unsightly, tight^fitting cap, 
high-buttoned dust-coat, and with tense expression on 
his face, nervous dread in his attitude, and wearing 
that unmistakable automobilious look in his counte- 
nance, goes racing and honking through nature's 
garden, is hardly in a condition, mentally or physi- 
cally, to find comfort or enjoyment in books. 

THE FREE DISTRIBUTION OF UNSPOKEN SPEECHES, 

or of speeches spoken before empty chairs, by our 
national law-makers, has reached such a magnitude 
that it forms no inconsiderable factor in our annual 
post-office deficit, of which we hear so much. So 
freely is the franking privilege used that as is 
estimated by a post-office official enough dead-head 
mail has gone out of Washington since the first of 
January to fill a freight-train that would need five 
engines to haul it. One recent order, on the gov- 
ernment printing-house and on the postal service, 
provided for the distribution of eight hundred 
thousand copies of a windy oration delivered by a 
Western senator, and as many more are still to go 
forth, it is said, to various parts of the country. 
This national encouragement of an all but universal

human weakness, the cacoetheg loquendi, is of course 
the height of extravant folly. No one profits by 
it, least of all the senator or representative thus 
enamored of his own verbosity. Votes will not be 
captured nor political converts made by this frenzied 
use of the franking privilege.

PERFECTION IN PROSE STYLE. A MODERN 

ENGLISH INSTANCE. 
(To the Editor of TUB DIAL.) 

Your remarks in THK DIAL for July 16, concern- 
ing the scrupulous literary workmanship of Gustave 
Flaubert and the late Jules Kenard, can hardly fail to 
remind us of the similar quality in the work of our 
English Walter Pater that parfait prosateur, as Hour- 
get once pronounced him. 

Prolonged communion with his own soul in his tour 
(Vivoire evolved for him a unique philosophical creed of 
intense living. His own splendid words best express this 
attitude of his toward the serious aspects of life: 

' ' Every moment some form grows perfect in hand or face ; 
some tone on the hills or the sea is choicer than the rest ; 
some mood of passion or insight or intellectual excitement is 
irresistibly real and attractive for us, for that moment 
only. ... A counted number of pulses only is given to as of 
a variegated, dramatic life. How may we see in them all 
that is to be seen in them by the finest senses ? How shall 
we pass most swiftly from point to point, and be present 
always at the focus where the greatest number of vital forces 
unite in their purest energy ? To burn always with this hard, 
gemlike flame, to maintain this ecstasy, is success in life." 

The New Cyrenaicism of this modern Aristippua, 
the hedonism of the ancient Epicurean communicated 
to the spirit of this modern pagan, afforded a practical 
guide to the proper conduct of the intellectual life and 
made especially mandatory a certain definite attitude 
toward the products of the beaux arts. To be constantly 
immersed in the crystal stream of pleasurable sensation, 
one must not squander his time or energy in attempting 
to fathom turbid waters. The most masterful creations 
only must serve to appease our (esthetic appetites 
those which express the very thought and spirit of the 
author. "The essence of all artistic beauty," writes 
Pater in one of his lectures, "is expression, . . . the 
line, the color, the word, following obediently and with 
minute scruple the conscious motions of a convinced, 
intelligible soul." To the intellectual anarchy of his 
time he believed this principle a stranger. He accord- 
ingly advised writers to take more pains and write 
English as a learned language. His own tiresome and 
torturous labor with the pen proved how punctilious he 
was a veritable priest preserving the fountain of 
English speech pure and undefiled. 

His own words, put in the thought of his one nota- 
ble creation, Marius the Epicurean, best exemplify his 
artistic restraint in the use of superflous words: 

" He would make of it [the native speech] a serious study, 
weighing the precise power of every phrase and word, M 
though it were precious metal, disentangling the later asso- 
ciations and going back to the original and native sense of 
each restoring to full significance all its wealth of latent 
figurative expression/' ..." From the very beginning of pro- 
fessional literature, the ' labour of the file ' a labour in the 
ease of Plato, for instance, or Virgil, like that of the oldest 



of goldsmiths as described by Apnleius, enriching the work 
by far more tli.m tin- weight <>f precious metal it removed 
has always had it* function." 

This whole matter is aptly summed up in the essay 
on Style: 

" For in truth all art does but consixt in the removal of 
surplusage, from the last finish of the gem-engraver blowing 
away the last particle of invisible dust, back to the earliest 
divination of the finished work to be, lying somewhere, 
according to Michelangelo's fancy, in the rough-hewn block 
of stone." 

The " Conclusion " to " The Renaissance " best illus- 
trates how Pater himself laboriously wielded the file. 
It contains in brief outline the summary of his philo- 
sophical and artistic creed, every word pregnant with 
purposeful meaning. I cannot forbear quoting a few 
lines. 

"While all melts under our feet, we may well catch at 
any exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that 
seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, 
or any stirring of the senses, strange dyes, strange colours, 
and curious odors, or work of the artist's hands, or the face 
of one's friend. Not to discriminate every moment some 
passionate attitude in those about us, and in the brilliancy 
of their gifts some tragic dividing of forces on their ways, is, 
on this short day of frost and HUH, to sleep before evening- 

On this short day of frost and gun, to sleep before 
evening. How much is conveyed in these few words! 
how poignant the sense they give us of the brevity of 
human life! And what penetrating precision they show 
in the handling of the tools of English speech!

COLLEGES AND THE CARNEGIE FOUNDATION. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Recently, at the meeting of the National Teachers' 
Association in Boston, there was a somewhat sharp 
attack on the Carnegie Foundation, one much distressed 
high-school teacher complaining because the Foundat i<>n 
is compelling colleges to live up to some reasonable 
standards of entrance requirements, in brief, because 
it is insisting that some things are worth counting 
toward a college degree and some other things are not. 
It is contended by the critics of the Foundation that the 
preparation for college which it demands of secondary 
schools is not a preparation for life; that college educa- 
tion itself is not such a preparation. The fact of the 
matter is, and we ought to face it squarely, that 
preparation for life, as it is lived by some people, is not 
entitled to any academic recognition whatever. 

Educationally, here in America, we have been facing 
the problem of granting academic distinction to people 
whose sole title to such honors has been that, figura- 
tively, they have learned how to dig post-holes carefully. 
It is the business of the college to say clearly and with- 
out any truckling that its distinctions are to be bestowed 
upon those who have done a particular kind of work 
and have done it with a certain degree of thoroughness; 
and upon them only. It must always have, as one of its 
chief aims, that of establishing a proper sense of value- ; 
declaring that some things are more worth while than 
others; that a scholar and a gentleman is a little finer 
product of our educational machinery than a clown, 
however efficient the clown may be in doing his part of 
the world's work; and that its rewards and recognitions 
are for intellectual effort of a certain high type, and 
for that alone. The high-school teacher referred to 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



59 



complains that the Carnegie Foundation is a monopoly 
In a certain sense that is true, but it has the justifica- 
tion of being a legitimate and proper monopoly. It is 
a monopoly instituted in defense of those who hold cer- 
tain badges of accomplishment, and are not willing to 
have them cheapened through being offered as the 
reward of another and quite different sort of achieve- 
ment. The protest by this teacher that these badges 
cannot be secured by him for his pupils on his condi- 
tions, that is, by doing a kind of work that he calls 
practical, instead of that kind that should introduce 
them to the intellectual life of the world, is at least 
amusing. It is a plea for equality of standing in spite 
of inequality of condition; a plea that we shall have to 
ignore, if college degrees are to mean anything or be 
things sought after by ambitious young men and women. 

Doubtless in a democracy the difficulty of maintain- 
ing what in a sense is class distinction is peculiarly 
serious. It is one of the dangers of political equality 
that it makes it less easy to preserve the finer ideals of 
the better classes against the clamors of the mob. That 
is in part the business of the colleges and universities; 
and in a democracy the problem is complicated by the 
circumstance that some of the official conservers of 
ideals in educational institutions have never come into 
possession of those ideals themselves in any deep sense, 
because those who are not to the manner born cannot 
acquire them in the class-room, and yet for the patient 
and the industrious some class-rooms at least are the 
road to educational preferment. Again, the very ex- 
pansion of our educational system which is one of the 
splendid achievements of our American democracy has 
brought about instruction in a vast variety of subjects, 
acquaintance with which is not the mark of any acquire- 
ments entitled to any honor or reward beyond that for 
which they have been in the first instance pursued 
material success in life. The teachers of these subjects, 
however, do not wish to be counted among the outer 
barbarians, and they are aggressive and powerful by 
reason of their numbers. They campaign for their 
cause unceasingly; but the distinction between working 
with the brain and working with the hands, between 
spending even mental energy upon big problems and 
upon little problems, is a distinction vital in things 
themselves, and no amount of propagandisin will ever 
change it. 

"That is what we want," said the teacher to whom 
reference has been made, speaking of his demand for 
recognition of everything that the high school may see 
fit to offer as preparation for college. "Don't fool 
yourselves, there's a lot yet to be done." He fools 
himself seriously if he imagines that the educational 
world is ever going to count skill in digging post-holes, 
however studiously acquired, equal to skill in unravel- 
ling or attacking some of the great human problems. 
Some people must forever be satisfied with a training 
for life that does not merit academic distinction, and 
they must leave such academic distinction to those who 
really deserve it by reason of their devotion to other 
problems of another and a higher kind of life. Perhaps 
it is a pity that we cannot all be so distinguished; but 
when we are, a great many of us will not care for dis- 
tinction, and the world will settle into a dead level of 
mediocrity. Then we will be universally content to go 
to our several human destinies through reform-schools 
with industrial educational attachments, or other like 
institutions, without feeling that there is anything to dif- 
ferentiate us sharply from university graduates. That 



will make earth a paradise for some sections of society 
against whose undue activities the Carnegie Foundation 
and some other agencies bid fair to preserve us for 
awhile. No doubt we shall do well to increase the 
efficiency of all classes of people through education, to 
provide means for that more and more, to train the 
artisan steadily to greater effectiveness in his work; 
but we must all the more certainly provide safeguards 
against the presumptions of those who would break 
down real distinctions and put the stamp of gold and 
silver upon brass and lead.

THE QUESTION OF " IMMORAL DRAMA." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Iii a recent number of THK DIAL, a corre'spoudent 
writing to commend a review of Mr. Clayton Hamil- 
ton's book on " The Theory of the Theatre " protests 
when he comes upon the quoted statement, " There is 
no such thing, per se, as an immoral subject for a play : 
in the treatment of the subject, and only in the treat- 
ment, lies the basis for ethical judgment of the piece." 

It seems to me that the attempt to controvert the 
truth contained in this passage is of little value in con- 
sidering the faults of the modern drama. Discussions 
of what plays or what novels ought to be produced or 
read can only add to the confusion in which the subject 
is involved, unless a vital distinction is kept clearly in 
mind the distinction between the ethical and the 
aesthetic. Many a fruitless contention as to whether a 
thing is immoral or not resolves itself into a question of 
whether it offends the aesthetic sense. There are many 
things, not necessarily immoral, that refined people do 
not care to see or to talk much about; they are offen- 
sive to good taste, and hence not to be desired. 

Those who uphold offensive plays because of "the 
lesson they teach " are only ridiculous ; and the claim 
of pious motives on the part of managers who produce 
such dramas is obviously absurd. It seems no less 
absurd to insist that because a play's motive is offensive 
to taste, its subject-matter is immoral. If the spectator 
dislikes the theme of " Camille," for instance, let him 
say frankly that he is out of sympathy with such sub- 
jects for stage presentation, not that the story of 
" Camille " is an immoral one. So long as a play tells 
the truth about the characters it deals with and the 
phase of life it portrays, it is not necessarily immoral. 
But if it outrages our sense of the aesthetic, or of plain 
decency, we may very properly condemn it on this 
score. To quote further from Mr. Hamilton : 

" Critics who condemn ' Ghosts ' because of its subject- 
matter might as well condemn ' Othello ' because the hero 
kills his wife what a suggestion, look you, to carry into our 
homes ! ' Macbeth ' is not immoral, though it makes night 
hideous with murder. The greatest of all Greek dramas, 
' (Edipus King,' is in itself sufficient proof that morality is a 
thing apart from subject-matter. The only way in which a 
play may be immoral is for it to cloud, in the spectator, the 
consciousness of those invariable laws of life which say to 
men ' Thou shalt ' or ' Thou shalt not.' " 

It would aid much to clear the discussion about 
" the immorality of present-day drama " to keep these 
points in view, and to distinguish clearly between that 
which offends pur sense of delicacy and that which 
presents a false or vicious conception of life.

(The $lcuj iioohs. 



To take to the law in middle life after tasting, 
if only in an amateur and i/l/t-f finite fashion, the 
delights of the muses, is less common than to 
abandon the bar for the pursuit of art or liter- 
ature. Mr. Thomas Edward Crispe, who has 
just given to the world his diverting Remi- 
niscences of a K. ( '.." did not take up the study 
of his ultimate profession until his thirty-eighth 
year, having until then been a lecturer, an actor 
of rather more than amateur pretensions, and 
the follower of a calling which he thus briefly 
describes in his opening chapter : 

" On leaving school I was articled to a quasi profes- 
sion, to complete my training, and eventually become 
what is called a scientific witness, and of my experiences 
before Committees of both Houses of Parliament, for 
and against Railway companies, School and local boards, 
drainage and other schemes, I shall have a word to say." 

Called to the Bar in 1874, when he was forty- 
one years old, he made as a pleader so good use 
of his previously cultivated oratorical and histri- 
onic powers that success was not long in coming 
to him in his new profession. In fact, he seems 
always to have had a happy knack of succeed- 
ing in whatever he undertook, and this facility 
marks the agreeable volume of miscellaneous 
recollections that now adds the honors of au- 
thorship to his other achievements. By no 
means to lawyers exclusively, but to all readers 
disposed to while away a summer's day with 
an anecdotal narrative of personal experience 
among men and women of more or less character 
and note all frankly stated and frequently 
spiced with more than a pinch of self-compla- 
cency Mr. Crispe's short and not seldom 
vivacious chapters will strongly appeal. 

The loss of his father before his birth may 
have helped to develop early a not unpleasing 
self-assurance that carried the young man tri- 
umphantly through many an ordeal, from a 
lecture delivered at twenty-two before a critical 
London audience to his latest professional suc- 
cesses as King's Counsel. In this connection 
let us quote his advice to the law student who 
wishes to succeed as a pleader of causes. 

"Let any young man who is training for the Bar 
remember, that if when he joins it he hides his candle 
under a bushel, no one will see the light There is a 
difference between being opinionated and entertaining 
a good opinion of yourself; the latter is a tonic for suo-

pen, but if you take too much of the medicine buy a 
coffin. A wholesome Ix-ln t in \<>ur own ability can do 
no harm a little modest assurance, and do not fail t<> 
express it. The man who dubs you egotist, windbag, 
and froth-blower, in all probability has no ' ego ' of his 
own not even an air retainer for intellectual bubbles. 
You must believe in yourself; if you do not, no one will 
believe in you." 

If now the reader has not a pretty good men- 
tal picture of the pushful barrister whose divert- 
ing reminiscences we are considering, let him 
go to the book itself and fill in the details of the 
portrait. Possibly a few more extracts here 
will be an immediate aid. In an early chapter 
the author says, a propos of a stage kiss and 
embrace which he as " Citizen Sangfroid " had 
to give to " Pauline " in the play of " Delicate 
Ground," "I do not arrogate much to my- 
self, but I can say I have always tried to do 
what I have had to do, thoroughly." This qual- 
ity of whole-heartedness in his undertakings, 
including the writing of his " Reminiscences," 
is not the least of his engaging attributes. In 
the relation of certain youthful experiences in 
London occurs this characteristic passage : 

" Once launched, I was soon sailing on my own 
account; but my life was not one of dissipation, rather 
of inquiry. I was acquisitive and wanted to see every- 
thing, and if I sometimes saw something which was not 
good for me, it did me no harm. I had seen it, and 
there was an end of it." 

The record of Mr. Crispe's intercourse with 
stage folk in the years when he trod the boards 
contains many amusing and informing glimpses 
of theatrical celebrities, and occasionally a rapid 
pen-portrait of some literary or artistic char- 
acter. A personal experience of his in engaging 
Thackeray to give his lectures on " The Four 
Georges " discovers in the great novelist sundry 
very human but not exactly admirable traits, 
including a robust appetite for flattery, hyper- 
sensitiveness to criticism, and a disposition to 
drive a hard bargain in pecuniary matters. 
But perhaps he is made all the more real to us 
by being represented as so undeniably human. 
A passing reference to Joseph Jefferson repre- 
sents him as far more the one-part actor than 
he really was. 

At the Adelphi I saw Jefferson in liii> van Winkle, 
which had an enormous London success. Much later 
on, playgoers had the opportunity of seeing Mr. Tree as 
4 Rip' an excellent and conscientious performance, 
but lacking the naturalness which so distinguished Jef- 
ferson, who was condemned to play the part for life, 
like Sothern, who became the martyr of ' Lord Dun- 
dreary ' in the humorous role of that very accent rit- 
nobleman." 

The following in regard to the incomparable 
Fanny Kemble, whom Mr. Crispe had engaged

for a course of Shakespeare readings at a liter- 
ary club to which he belonged, is worth quoting. 
" She was also a great success. I found her a charm- 
ing woman, but much as her relative, Charles Santley, 
has recently described her. An air of repellent dignity 
seemed to dominate her, and she made one recognize 
that she was a person of importance. Her presence was 
quite Siddonian. We old stagers, perhaps, underrate 
the merits of the actors and actresses of to-day and 
make unfavorable comparison with those of the past, 
but my belief is that very few, if any, of the ladies now 
on the stage could match her. As readings, her ' Julius 
Caesar ' and ' Coriolauus ' were superb." 

To illustrate the author's versatility as an 
actor, we find him appearing, on the regular or 
the amateur stage, in parts as various as Claude 
Melnotte in " The Lady of Lyons," Dr. Pan- 
gloss in "The Heir at Law," Cox in "Box and 
Cox," Goldfinch in "The Road to Ruin," Bottom 
in " A Midsummer Night's Dream," the First 
Witch in " Macbeth," Captain Absolute in 
" The Rivals," John Mildmay in " Still Water 
Runs Deep," " Sir Edward Mortimer in " The 
Iron Chest," Maurice Warner in " Camilla's 
Husband," and many other roles familiar to 
Victorian play-goers. 

In a chapter headed " A Few Remarkable 
Men " there are gathered some recollections of 
Archibald Forbes, Edmund Yates, Frederick 
Villiers, and others. This concerning Kinglake 
is interesting : 

" To the war correspondents whom I have met, I 
add Kinglake, the great historian of the Crimean War. 
I only knew him a few years before his death. He was 
a most courtly man with that old knightly manner 
which has gone out of fashion, full of graceful gallantry 
even in trivial matters. I recollect when my two daugh- 
ters were quite little girls, their going to a children's 
party, on which occasion he sent them two lovely bou- 
quets, which made them very proud : a mere triviality, 
but worthy of the kind heart of the author of Eothen." 

The author's professional experience of judges 
on the bench seems to have been a wide one, 
and the carefulness of his study of these digni- 
taries, with reference to the shaping of his pleas 
and arguments before them, entitles him to a 
repectful hearing in his retrospective descrip- 
tions of their various pecularities. " Study your 
judge," was always his maxim, he tells us ; 
" humour his weakness judges have some 
and never skate up to dangerous water. In such 
way, you may manage the judge whom other 
counsel have found unmanageable. Whenever 
you find your judge will do your work for you, 
let him do it ; he will do it much better than 
you can." Among the eminent occupants of 
the judicial bench whom the author presents to 
our view are Chief Justices Cockburn and Cole- 
ridge, Lord Russell of Killowen, Justice Lush, 



Sir George Jessel, Baron Huddleston, Justice 
Gainsford Bruce, Lord Brampton, and many 
others of note. Lord Russell he speaks of as 
" A figure which stood out pre-eminent among the 
legal men of the Victorian period, whether as Lord 
Chief Justice or Sir Charles Russell, whether as advo- 
cate, orator, or judge. As advocate, intrepid, brilliant, 
' he could electrify the jury by the magic of his voice.' 
A perfect elocutionist inflection, emphasis, accent, 
pause, harmony, all taking fit place. His action grand 
or graceful, as occasion required. His eloquence impas- 
sioned, he could move the multitude. In the great 
Parnell case, when he said, ' I have spoken not merely 
as an advocate, I have spoken for the land of my birth,' 
his speech was one of intense patriotism. I had the 
advantage of hearing it." 

Under reminiscences of Lord Chief Justice 
Cockburn occurs the following : 

" I remember, as if it were yesterday, his marvellous 
summing up in the Tichborne case, in which I was sur- 
prised to find my old amateur [actor] friend Dickins 
foreman of the jury. I felt great interest in it, as I 
was acquainted with ' Tichborne,' or ' de Castro,' or 
' Arthur Orton,' or whosoever he was. Many believed 
in the Claimant I confess I did. I was younger then. 
I recollect once sitting by his bedside when he was 
ill a sparsely furnished room, a large crucifix at the 
head of his bed, the burly man lying on his back. I 
was much struck by his manner, and, despite the errors 
of speech of a seemingly uneducated man, he was full 
of intelligence, his ideas well expressed, his voice soft, 
even melodious, his bearing that of a gentleman he 
was a mystery." 

Not unlike the Tichborne case was the recent 
famous Druce case, with which Mr. Crispe was 
professionally connected, and of which he writes 
authoritatively, as he also does of the well-known 
case of " The Country Girl." Other chapters, 
on which we cannot here dwell, contain useful 
advice and instructive instances for young bar- 
risters. As a combination of actor, bohemian, 
club-man, frequenter of smart society, and suc- 
cessful barrister, Mr. Crispe writes in a manner 
to attract and hold one's attention. Two por- 
traits of him, in wig and gown, appear in the 
book.

distinct advance in the way of general plan or 
intended function ; and they actually show little 
improvement in certain respects where it might 
with confidence have been awaited. Though we 
may again applaud the choice of some of the 
persons who have been enrolled as contributors, 
there is reason for astonishment at the number 
of others who are scarcely known in the field of 
English scholarship, and who in more tlian one 
instance have not succeeded in acquiring the 
bare technique of a passable style. It is true, 
Volumes III. and IV. contain a few articles 
which excel in style, in simplicity and directness 
of presentation, and in the rejection of details 
that might be confusing or in dispute, as well 
as of matter which, however attractive in itself, 
might not justly be included in the history of 
literature. Yet, to offset this, there are entire 
chapters which are devoted to such topics as 
"The Dissolution of the Religious Houses," 
" English Universities, Schools, and Scholar- 
ship in the Sixteenth Century," " The Book- 
trade, 1557-1625," and "The Foundation of 
Libraries." The second of these in particular 
constitutes a valuable discussion, long needed, 
of a subject having the utmost importance to 
students of Elizabethan poetry ; but it repre- 
sents the kind of subordinate investigation upon 
which the history of literature must be founded, 
rather than a portion of that history itself. 
And why, we may ask, should an article on the 
book-trade between the years 1557 and 1675, if 
it is to appear at all in such surroundings, be 
almost half again as long as one dealing with 
the position and influence of the Authorized 
Version of the Bible especially when the edi- 
tors in charge have given their tacit approval to 
the belief that the Authorized Version is the 
first English classic," and to citations showing 
that it has been the most vital of all forces in 
its reaction upon subsequent masterpieces in 
English? Is there any good reason for this dis- 
cord between the implied theory and the actual 
practice? No satisfying answer can be given 
to these questions ; hence we may negatively 
characterize the two volumes under discussion 
as not only lacking, on the whole, in workman- 
ship of style, but also as deficient in general 
perspective. 

It seems necessary to speak still further of 
these shortcomings, as well as to point out the 
high degree of excellence which has been at- 
tained by some of the individual contributors. 
No one, however, will expect so brief a review 
as this to emphasize all the merits of two large 
volumes ; for the work, when everything is said, 



henceforth must be regarded as indispensable 
to the serious student of English literature. 

In the matter of perspective, then, it may be 
observed that the amount of space which has 
been variously allotted to Dray ton, Campion, 
Burton, and Sir John Davies, does not by any 
means correspond to what one might naturally 
have predicted. It is not easy to comprehend 
why Drayton has a long chapter to himself, 
and not Daniel also ; or Campion a short one, 
while Davies has but a few pages. If the rela- 
tive importance of these men were to be esti- 
mated by the effect of each upon the literature 
of the nineteenth century and an objective 
standard of this sort would be better than 
none, the attention which they would respect- 
ively secure would be very different from that 
which is accorded to them in the Cambridge 
History. And by what arbitrary ruling canu 1 
the editors to decide that Sir Walter Kaleigh, 
rather than Sir Philip Sidney, should be treated 
in a separate chapter ? The fact is, of course, 
that in their desire at one time to follow the 
trend of literary movements, at another to dis- 
cuss types of literature, and at another to re- 
count the life of some very eminent individual, 
Messrs. Ward and Waller have not consistently 
adhered to any manifest principle of division 
and arrangement. As a result, we are too fre- 
quently annoyed by interruptions like the fol- 
lowing, from the account of Samuel Daniel in 
Volume IV. (p. 155) : 

" Daniel's sonnets have been discussed elsewhere 
[in Volume III.], and no further mention need be made 
of them here, while his Senecan tragedies and his 
masques also belong to another section [other sections?] 
of this work [i. ., Volumes V. and VI., which are yet 
to come]." 

Cross-references of this nature are sufficiently 
trying within the limits of a single volume. 
Where the treatise is more extensive, they are 
possibly unavoidable. Nevertheless, in a model 
structure like Croiset's Hlstoire de la Littera- 
ture Grecque the scaffolding is not thus pain- 
fully obtrusive, indeed, one topic is there 
considered at a time, and the treatment of it 
finished ; nor is the clear-out impression of any 
phase of a subject marred by the arid and 
formless writing in which the editors of the 
Cambridge History have now and then allowed 
their collaborators to indulge. A case where 
editorial revision was needed may be found on 
page 188 of Volume IV. 

" Kulke Greville, lord Brooke, belonged to an elder 
generation than that of the other poets in this chapter, 
and was an exact contemporary of Sir Philip Sidney, 
whose life he wrote. . . . Kulke Grerille, primarily,

was a statesman and man of affairs. In 1598, he be- 
came treasurer of the navy, and, in 1614, chancellor of 
the exchequer. Born at Beauchamp court, Warwick- 
shire, in 1554, Fulke Greville entered Shrewsbury school 
on the very same day as Philip Sidney, 17 October 
1564, and, from Shrewsbury, he went to Jesus College, 
Cambridge, four years later. . . . Fulke Greville was 
a great patron of letters." 

This repetitious clattering of dry bones, from a 
writer who at his best displays no little anima- 
tion and critical insight, may serve to introduce 
a few additional remarks upon the style, or 
styles, of the Cambridge History. 

At the outset, one may observe that, had the 
present work been a history of Greek literature, 
organized under the direction of men like Pro- 
fessors Tucker and Rhys Roberts, and other 
pupils of the late Sir Richard Jebb at Cam- 
bridge, the quality of the composition would 
almost certainly have been better on an average, 
and more even throughout. Is it possible that, 
by a tendency toward a too narrow specializa- 
tion, scholarship in English has been drifting 
away in Great Britain from the more humane 
traditions of culture, and that, as in Germany 
and America, special students of modern litera- 
ture are rewarded for their energy in searching 
out and merely recording, rather than for the 
attainment of a sense of values through 
investigation, of course, or for taste and the 
power of synthesis? If so, the editors of the 
Cambridge History, both of them skilled and 
acceptable writers, ought to be among thejfirst to 
react against so harmful a drift, by exercising a 
greater care in the choice of their assistants. 

One would not wish to see Mr. de Selincourt, 
from whom the remarks on Fulke Greville are 
taken, in the number of those excluded. Since 
he is by no means the worst offender, we may 
quote his " Successors of Spenser " once or 
twice more, by way of indicating the average. 
In the following, he has not regarded Robert 
Louis Stevenson on the desirability of avoiding 
a too obvious recurrence of the letter p in 
English : 

" In like manner, Sidney's famous apology for poetry 
and the English language worked upon his successors so 
greatly that they one and all wished themselves poets; 
and a surprising number were poets" (IV., p. 172). 

Similarly here : 

" He [Wither] . . . wrote pastorals, which were 
published in 1615 under the title The Shepherd's Hunt- 
ing. In the fourth eclogue, in praising the poetry of 
' My Willie,' ... he extolled the power of poetry in 
general " (IV., pp. 178-9). 

Again, this is a curious way in which to end an ac- 
count of the life of Drummond of Hawthornden : 



" He lived twenty-six years after the appearance of 
Flowers of Sion, and, from one point of view, his life in 
that year began. He took interest in the stirring events 
that followed the death of James I. ; he wrote a history 
of Scotland; he married and had many children; he 
wrote topical prose pamphlets ; he travelled ; he rebuilt 
his house " (IV., p. 177). 

" At any rate," demands Socrates in the 
Phcedrus, "you will allow that every discourse 
ought to be a liying creature, having a body of 
its own and a head and feet ; there should be 
a middle, beginning, and end, adapted to one 
another and to the whole? . . . Now in this 
rhyme whether a line comes first or comes last, 
as you will perceive, makes no difference." In 
the case of a person who displays so little self- 
suspicion as Mr. de Selincourt with respect to 
the employment of s and p, not to speak of 
sequence and other points of style, one may 
venture to exercise the animus supicax upon 
some part of his subject-matter. How many 
will agree that Drummond " saw and sang the 
truth [that God is love] less clearly, and, there- 
fore, less beautifully, than Shelley," though 
" there is much in them of surprising similar- 
ity"? "In Drummond's poems . . . the idea 
remained a beautiful theory, whereas Shelley 
applied the idea to human life and worked it 
out in amazing detail, helped by his profound 
knowledge of human nature " (IV., p. 177). To 
me at least, Shelley is distinguished by his pro- 
found lack of such knowledge. And is it safe 
to affirm that "the sympathy which Milton 
could not but feel for the rebel transformed the 
figure of Satan from a fine conception to one of 
immortal grandeur," or that Milton "human- 
ized the devil" (IV., p. 192)? "There is 
neither truth nor wit," observes Landor, follow- 
ing Addison, " in saying that Satan is hero [of 
' Paradise Lost '] , unless, as is usually the case 
in human life, he is the greatest hero who gives 
the widest sway to his own passions." Has 
Mr. de Selincourt been duped by the bombastic 
arguments of the Miltonic Satan, forgetting how 
Milton himself describes these utterances ? 

" High words, that bore 
Semblance of worth, not substance." 

In these quotations from " The Successors of 
Spenser," various odd commas, and the unex- 
pected absence of capital letters (" lord Brooke," 
"Jesus college"), are not the fault of the indi- 
vidual writer. The whole work, we must fear, is 
now committed to a mode of punctuation, espe- 
cially in the setting off of short restrictive 
phrases, adverbial qualifiers, and the like, which 
frequently is irritating and for the most part 



THE DIAL

seems to be unwaranted by the beet practice. 
The demands of uniformity notwithstanding, 
it would be well to adopt the less provincial 
usage in the remaining ten volumes. In the mat- 
ter of ordinary proof-reading also, the standard 
of exactness maintained by the Clarendon Press 
readily suggests itself as more desirable ; for 
though Volumes III. and IV. evince greater 
care in this regard than thqir predecessors, 
the number of misprints and other accidents of 
typography in them is far too large. " The Son- 
neteering Conceit of Immorality" [== Immor- 
tality] (III., p. 295) is a fair example. Also 
compare " Davison " with " Davidson," pp. 148, 
225, of Volume IV. 

But let us turn to what ought to be praised. 
" The sonneteering conceit of immortality " 
strikes a key-note in Mr. Sidney Lee's chapter 
on " The Elizabethan Sonnet," an able discus- 
sion, clear, full, and precise, showing the fruit 
of recent studies in Elizabethan authors and 
their French or Italian models; yet somewhat 
wanting in the quality of sympathetic insight. 
Mr. Lee does, in fact, lay too much stress upon 
questions of external form and superficial evi- 
dences of imitation ; so that in the next vol- 
ume (IV., p. 204) Mr. Harold H. Child is forced 
to observe : 

Into the vexed question of the genuineness of the 
sentiments expressed in [Drayton's] and other Eliza- 
bethan sonnets, this is not the place to enter. It is 
perhaps, generally recognized that the adoption of a 
poetic convention does not necessarily denote insincerity 
in the poet; and the question is not whether or whence 
he borrowed his conventions, but whether he lias sub- 
dued them to his own genius." 

We might infer from Mr. Lee that not even 
Spenser was competent wholly to subdue a bor- 
rowed form to the sincere expression of his own 
feelings. Still, if we put together what Mr. 
Courthope and others have said in these two 
volumes about the poets' poet, Mr. Lee's insist- 
ence on some of his favorite conclusions, even 
where they are not highly imaginative, will send 
no one far astray. 

Spenser does indeed, and with justice, receive 
a large share of attention in these sections of 
the Cambridge History ; and Mr. Courthope's 
special chapter on him is one of the most satis- 
factory things thus far in the whole work. It 
is not inspired no one who is familiar with 
Mr. Courthope's " History of English Poetry " 
will marvel at the lack ; but his training through 

long term of years in his own extensive under- 
taking now enables him to render emphatic those 
things which ought to be made so, and to pass 
over and omit what is relatively or altogether 



trivial. In other words, notwithstanding the 
customary dryness of his manner, he displays 
certain qualities which the Cambridge History 
as a whole does not, by manifesting a sense of 
order and proportion. His " Summary View 
of Spenser's Genius" (III., pp. 277-280) is 
admirable in its breadth and precision. 

If the editors were fortunate in obtaining the 
services of Mr. Courthope for " The Poetry of 
Spenser," they were yet more so in securing those 
of Mr. Whibley for the chapter in Volume IV. 
on the Elizabethan translators ; for his sub- 
stance is equally good, and the form of his pre- 
sentation most engaging. He too has an eye 
for what is of vital interest, so that we may 
condone his occasional fondness for epigram, if 
it betrays him into nothing worse than the 
declaration that Arthur Golding is never a 
poet and never a shirk." Are we to admit 
that the bits of Golding's Ovid that have crept 
into the dramas of Shakespeare are not poet- 
ical? But we note with satisfaction that, in 
spite of the adverse judgment of Matthew 
Arnold, Mr. Whibley regards Chapman's 
translation of Homer as not only " vigorous," 
but also "faithful." "To do full justice to 
Chapman*s work," he adds (IV., pp. 24-25), 
" a continuous reading is necessary. It shines 
less brightly in isolated passages than in its 
whole surface, various and burnished, like the 
shield of Achilles." Our commendation of the 
chapter must be extended so as to include the 
valuable bibliography of translations in thirteen 
pages of the appendix. No comparable list of 
references has hitherto been published. 

What has been observed concerning the 
choice of collaborators for these two volumes 
does not hold with reference to the scholars who 
have been enlisted from countries outside of 
Great Britain. Professor Koeppel of Freiburg, 
for example, speaks with authority upon Barclay 
and Skelton ; and our own Professor Cunliffe 
has two suitable chapters dealing with "A 
Mirror for Magistrates " and " George Gas- 
coigne." Moreover, the editors have bestowed 
a signal mark of consideration upon America 
by inviting Professor Cook of Yale to explain 
the position and influence of the King James 
version of the Bible, a task for which the 
author was well fitted on account of his investi- 
gations into the bearing of Scriptural literature 
upon Old Kn^lish, and his rontinnrd study of 
the relations between the Bible and subsequent 
writers like Kuskin, Shelley, and Burke.

FROM ALASKA TO 



With pending realization of the long hoped- 
for and long deferred opening of a canal across 
the isthmus of Panama, the great Pacific Coast 
that remotest of all shores from the main 
routes of commerce and travel is destined to 
become the goal of an increasing number of 
Argonauts. The advertising literature of enter- 
prising railroads, the richly-illustrated booklets 
of enthusiastic and experienced secretaries of 
state promotion committees and local chambers 
of commerce, and the glowing tributes of town- 
site and colony promotors, have done much to 
inform the enquiring public of the attractions, 
genuine and prospective, of the region which is 
well called the Italy of America. It is both 
refreshing and informing to turn from this 
alluring if sometimes turbid flood of informa- 
tion to a pleasing group of books whose authors 
view our occidental shores from diverse angles 
of vision and with very different horizons. 

A comprehensive glance at "The Great 
Pacific Coast " of the three Americas is to be 
found in Mr. C. Reginald Enock's book with 
that title. The author's wide experience in 
travel, and his previous works dealing with 
Spanish-American countries bordering upon the 
Pacific, have made it possible for him to bring 
together in a unique volume a very complete 
and readable account of the Pacific countries, 
from Chili to Alaska, of " these sunset lands 
where roll twelve thousand miles of ocean surge 
against the Pacific shores." Single chapters are 
given to Mexico, Central America, Columbia, 
and Ecuador, Peru, and Chili ; and four each 
to California and the Northwest, including 
Alaska. The book is rich in historical refer- 
ences, is descriptive in the best sense without 
being a dry mass of assorted detail, and is en- 
livened by personal incident and experiences. 
It exhibits to an unusual degree a comprehen-

sive grasp of the important and significant facts 
and factors in the environment of the peoples 
of the countries discussed, and of the industrial, 
commercial, social, and political factors of im- 
portance in their national life. Some inaccu- 
racies inevitably creep into a work planned so 
comprehensively. Thus, the reader might think 
that the Union Pacific Railroad entered Cali- 
fornia ; that eight thousand years was a fair 
estimate of the age of the great Sequoias, 
whereas four thousand is doubtless nearer the 
fact. The author's statistics of population also 
need chronological coordination, and his state- 
ment that prostitution is legalized in San Fran- 
cisco calls for correction. It is far from being 
true that the State University at Berkeley 
" owes its existence mainly to a Calif ornian 
millionaire "; nor is the sweeping generalization, 
made a propos of the boasted freedom of our 
educational institutions, at all justified by the 
fact that " the colour-line is jealously drawn in 
all American institutions in a way unknown in 
Britain or British dependencies." The author 
writes quite sympathetically of the Spanish- 
American peoples to whose faults and foibles 
he is at least lenient. His knowledge of Amer- 
ican life has evidently been to a considerable 
degree gained in mining communities, those out- 
skirts of modern civilization where the veneer 
of culture is badly abraded and the stratifica- 
tion of society is reduced to the simplicity of 
elemental disorder. For this reason, and doubt- 
less also for others equally good and less com- 
plimentary to the Native Sons of the Golden 
West and to later arrivals, his freely expressed 
opinion of Californians is not palatable, nor on 
the whole a just appreciation of all the forces 
at work in our cosmopolitan life. He says : 

"The Americans are a remarkable people for trav- 
elling. They are ever running across their continent 
and up and down it with the activity of ants, with one 
underlying motive business. The powers of modern 
usuary are eloquently depicted in American railroads 
and hotels, and the ceaseless, restless life of barter 
which is the soul at present of these remarkable 
people. This constant flux and movement naturally 
prevents the crystallization of the Californians into the 
distinct nationality which their geographical environ- 
ment and history might otherwise have induced. . . . 
The character of the people, to British eyes, seems 
overshadowed at times by the almost aggressive 
incivility and cynical shrewdness common to the West- 
ern American, which often hides their otherwise good 
qualities." 

Though keenly critical of our crudities and 
shortcomings, and perhaps not fully cognizant 
of the sources of our culture and their real 
strength, the author is still sanguine " that an 



66

[August 1, 



era of real civilization will be the outcome of 
the strenuous life of this splendid stiff-necked 
people." 

Our three remaining books deal with more 
restricted areas, and are written from less com- 
prehensive points of view. The title of Mr. 
C. F. Holder's "Channel Islands" at once turns 
our thoughts abroad ; but San Clemente, Santa 
Catalina, and their lesser sisters, have little in 
common with Jersey and Guernsey beyond their 
isolation. Bits of drifting desert sand, or of 
cactus-clad canon, flung far a-sea and strung 
along the coast from Point Concepcion to the 
Mexican boundary, between the latitudes of 
34 and 35 (about those of the Riviera and of 
Egypt), the Channel Islands of California offer 
one of the most picturesque and attractive play 
grounds of the world, and are destined as they 
become better known to become a boon of 
inestimable value to all lovers of nature. No 
one is better qualified than Mr. Holder to write 
of these islands, of their superb climatic condi- 
tions, cooler in summer than the shores of Nova 
Scotia and warmer in winter than Naples, of 
their submarine gardens and forests of giant 
kelps, of their unrivalled game-fishes the leap- 
ing tuna, the great black sea-bass, the yellowtail, 
and the multitudinous lesser quarry of the deep- 
sea angler. Dr. Holder knows every nook and 
corner of the fishing-grounds, and is a veteran 
angler and sportsman, the founder and Presi- 
dent of the famous Tuna Club of Avalon, 
membership in which is based solely on genuine 
piscatorial achievement. His book is mainly 
for the sportsman and tourist. It is illumined 
with abundant local color, enlivened with adven- 
ture, and filled from cover to cover with infor- 
mation attractively presented and handsomely 
illustrated. The author is a naturalist as well 
as a sportsman, and writes with enthusiasm and 
authority of the wonderful life revealed by the 
clever device of glass-bottomed boats in the 
turquoise waters of the ocean, and of the 
strange desert fauna and flora of these scattered 
islands. 

Lower California remains to-day nearly as 
much a terra incognita as it was when voyagers 
charted it as an island and peopled its valleys 
with roving Amazons. Visited by followers 
of Cortez in 1533, and planted with Jesuit 
missions on an elaborate scale at great expense 
during the seventeenth century, little remains 
to-day of the Castilian civilization save the 
language and the shattered ruins of once mag- 
nificent missions or the crumbling bastions of 
long since dismantled forts. Twice won and 



twice lost a> a province of the Tinted State*, it 
yet remains a land apart from our own, with its 
beginnings of modern commercial exploitation 
largely in the hands of English syndicates and 
of French mining investors. Mr. Arthur W. 
North's " Camp and Camino in Lower Cali- 
fornia" is a vivid account of his travels the 
length of the land along the old " camino " or 
royal road connecting the missions. Surely the 
word " road " cannot be the equivalent of 
"camino" in this land at least, for even the 
trails are often untrodden and the ancient 
highway is lost in the desert or was never worn 
through the rocky fastnesses that bar all paths 
across the peninsula and guard its shores with 
barren precipitous cliffs. It is a land of mystery, 
of forgotten history, buried treasure, haunts of 
buccaneers, treacherous Indians, fierce pirates, 
and lost mines. For centuries it has taken 
its heavy toll on the engineers and prospectors 
who seek to explore its secrets and exploit its 
resources. Mr. North's book is a narrative of 
travel throughout the length and breadth of 
this land of desert and deserted mountains, of 
cactus and rattlesnakes, of widely separated 
water-holes and remote haciendas, and of thirst, 
thirst, and again thirst. Its higher mountains 
with their forests and game, the reputed great 
mineral wealth, the air of mystery which sur- 
rounds it, all send forth a perpetual challenge 
to adventurous spirits. The author is evidently 
such an one, and his story is well told. The 
illustrations are abundant, though unfortu- 
nately not well executed; but one is lucky to 
return from such a race with death without 
any pictures of the Inferno! 

The commercial point of view dominates Mr. 
Dixon Wallace's " Beyond the Mexican Sierras," 
a book which recounts his personal experiences 
of travel in the Mexican states of Sonora, 
Sinaloa, Tepic, and Julisco. This remote and 
formerly inaccessible corner of the great South 
ern republic is being rapidly opened up to travel 
and commerce by railroad extensions, and offers 
a splendid field for American enterprise. Mod- 
ern sanitary science has made possible the con- 
trol of diseases that have ravaged this coast, 
especially in the lowlands ; while the uplands 
offer superb climatic conditions, as well as rich 
agricultural and mineral lands. Mr. Wallace's 
book is valuable in the rather intimate account 
which it gives of native peoples and customs, and 
of the facilities or, rather, lack of them 
which these rural Mexican communities offer 
to the chance wayfarer. The work is richly 
illustrated, and is practically the first in the

THE FAMILY LIFE OF MOTLEY.* 



While we are waiting for the life of Motley 
in the series of " American Men of Letters," we 
give warm welcome to the handsomely printed, 
indexed, and illustrated work on " John Lothrop 
Motley and his Family," containing further let- 
ters and records not included in the two octavos 
of Motley's Correspondence edited by the late 
George William Curtis. These later letters, con- 
nected by a thread of chronology and history, 
have been edited by Motley's daughter Susan 
and her husband, Mr. Herbert St. John Mild- 
may. Here we can look upon the portraits of 
the father and mother of the great historian, 
observe him in his earlier life, study the linea- 
ments of his intellectual ancestors, see the house 
at the Hague in which he did some of his best 
work, learn how Prince Bismarck (who was his 
classmate) looked as a student, and contemplate 
his classic features as the Dutch artist, Madame 
JBisschop, delineated them. All true Americans 
feel proud as they look upon that picture. Those 
who have been behind the scenes will welcome 
as an old friend the volume of the Dutch his- 
torian Hoofd, which Motley holds in his left 
hand, no doubt opened at a favorite page. 
With this classic writer, as terse as Tacitus and 
as philosophical as Thucydides, Motley was as 
familiar as with the face of his wife. Around 
him, near the chair in the picture, are other 
books, like those of Bor and Wagenaar ; Mot- 
ley having read the works of the latter, as his 
Dutch physician told the reviewer, no fewer 
than nine times. 

Motley knew fully the tragedy as well as the 
joy of life, and the ironies of fate that have 
befallen his memory seem almost like cruel 
jibes. All his descendants, his grandchildren, 
and great-grandchildren, are English ; and the

eldest grandson, his pet and delight, was killed 
in the South African Boer War by a Dutchman. 
Thus this intensest of Americans is remembered 
in England in his living offspring as well as by 
literary fame ; while in the United States his 
writings alone, with a few artistic memorials in 
Boston, keep alive his genial memory. 

Perhaps the most interesting portion of the 
present volume will be found in the letters of 
Bismarck, who wrote and was written to in the 
most delightful spirit of camaraderie. When 
Motley sent him a copy of his " Rise of the 
Dutch Republic," Bismarck criticised his refer- 
ence to the alleged jus primce noctis, which as 
Professor Gummere in his " Germanic Origins " 
thinks, can belong only to the " horseplay of 
history"; while Bismarck asserts that it never 
existed in Germany in the sense in which the 
adversaries of the middle ages used it as a 
weapon against the German nobility. 

Excellent taste characterizes the selection 
and editing of these letters. They show Motley 
a most intense American, and a believer in the 
ultimate supremacy of the Union arms during 
the war between the States, as expressed in 
his illuminating and forceful letters in " The 
Times." No doubt the results of Grant's pound- 
ing, Sherman's march, Sheridan's dash, and 
Thomas's tenacity had much to do with Mr. 
Edward A. Freeman's discontinuance of that 
wonderful fragment of his on " The History of 
Federal Government from the Amphyctionic 
Council to the Disruption of the United States of 
America." It is needless to say that Freeman's 
first and only volume was published before 
Appomattox, and was written previous to the 
Confederacy's being " sawed into three pieces," 
as Motley says, at Vicksburg, Gettysburg, and 
Chattanooga. The editors have wisely omitted 
some letters written during the war which, if 
printed now, might have made Motley seem 
rancorous and implacable. 

Most delightful are the pictures of society 
and life in Austria. Despite the enjoyment of 
Motley and his family in those high circles, 
there must have been much to make a Yankee 
wish to laugh. One social canon required that 
engaged couples, when in public, must sit or 
stand together, holding between them a huge 
bouquet. Happily, engagements, when pub- 
lished, were not supposed to last longer than 
six weeks. We have most delightful bits of 
history about Motley's great book, how it was 
published, its reception, and the instant place 
it gave him in society and fame. Many of 
the letters are from, or written by, his wife,

daughters, or other members of the family, so

have found it one of the most delightful addi- 
tions to American epistolary literature.

SOME RECENT DRAMAS.* 

When a drama is offered only on the printed 
page, the critic does well to pause and hesitate. 
With a poem, a novel, an essay, his task is easier. 
These are written to be read; their authors have 
in mind an audience of readers, and readers only. 
With a play it is quite different. This is not written 
primarily to be read, but to be acted. Its author 
has in mind many things that he assumes will be 
provided by skilful actors and stage manager, 
tones of voice, illusive scenery, costumes, pantomime, 
even eloquent silence. Unless the critic is prepared 
to supply much of this " stage business " between 
the lines as he reads, he should question his own 
fitness. Whether a play " will act " is a more vital 
consideration than how it reads. 

In France, where we may well look for models 
of dramatic criticism as of many other forms of art, 
they are about to reestablish the " reading commit- 
tee" for the Comedie Francaise, abolished in 1901. 
During the last nine years, the power of accepting 
or rejecting new plays has been vested in the direc- 
tor of the theatre company. Now, the French Min- 
ister of Public Instruction proposes that new plays 
shall be submitted to a committee of ten with the 
Director as president, and that at least seven mem- 
bers besides himself must be present at its meetings. 
Plays are to be read either by the author himself 
or by his representative, or by a member of the 
committee in the presence of the author if he desires 
to attend. Such are the precautions that no really 
good thing shall fail to be recognized, no poor thing 
be exposed to the merciless glare of the footlights. 

Moreover, the burden laid upon the literary critic 
of the drama is comparatively a new one. For a 
long time indeed we have had the "literary drama" 
so-called, that is, dramas written frankly for liter- 
ary effect, almost always in blank verse, in a dialogue 
far removed, and meant to be far removed, from the

actual speech of daily life, and seldom with a view 
to stage presentation. Hence they differed little from 
poems, and could be judged mainly as poetry. 

But with the advent of the modern social drama 
compositions in prose aiming to present faithful 
pictures of men and manners a new type of plays 
has presented itself for judgment These plays 
date almost entirely from the last two decades, and 
they are pouring forth in a vast flood. Of the two 
thousand manuscripts said to have been submitted 
to the New Theatre in New York during the first 
fourteen weeks of its history, it is safe to say that a 
very large proportion were of this type. Of the six 
books of plays on the present reviewer's table, five 
are written with the evident hope of stage presenta- 
tion, only one is frankly a closet drama. Also, it 
is somewhat typical of the present fashion in drama 
that not one of these six books has to deal with pres- 
ent times or themes in America. And this too is 
in accord with the experience of the New Theatre. 
Although the encouragement of American play- 
wrights was one of its principal objects, only two 
plays by American authors were found of sufficient 
merit to be chosen, and only one of these dealt with 
American characters or conditions. Can it be that 
our lives are so hopelessly dull and commonplace 
that we offer no dramatic material ? Is it not, rather, 
that the dramatist is not alive to his opportunity, 
that it is his own lack of genius for seeing below the 
surface of things, his own lack of the poetic power, 
as Emerson defined it, "to see the miraculous in 
the common"? 

In only one of our present group of books do we 
meet characters from everyday life and speaking 
the language of our own time. Mrs. W. K. Clifford, 
first on our list, offers " Three Plays " of English 
life. They seem quite well adapted for stage pre- 
sentation ; indeed, one of them " Mr. Hamilton's 
Second Marriage" has already been given in a 
London theatre. Another, "The Modern Way," has 
been adapted from a story of the same title. But 
the best play in the book is "Thomas and the 
Princess," a sweet love-story brought to a happy 
ending after a conflict with English traditions and 
class prejudices. Although not at all thrilling, it is 
sane and wholesome, and we have not too many 
such just now. 

Another volume of English plays is "Allison's 
Lad, and Other Martial Interludes" by Mrs. Bvulah 
Dix, six plays, each of one act only, and tatter 
suited to amateur than to professional presentation. 
In the four-act drama by Mrs. Munn, Shake- 
speare is the hero. The first act is laid in 1582, at 
Charlecote Park, just after Shakespeare has stolen 
the deer; the second act is four years later, and 
shows him fleeing from his fireside with a company 
of strolling players; the third is twelve years afu-r, 
when he has won fame and gained entrance to the 
courtly circles of the London of Queen Elizabeth ; 
the fourth presents him at the crisis when lie takes 
his resolve to return to his wife and children at 
Stratford. Thus the action covers that period of 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



69 



Shakespeare's life of which least is known, and 
which offers such a tempting field to the imagina- 
tion. All of the characters are historic, and no 
undue liberties have been taken with any of them. 
It all " might have been," from the little we know 
of what really was. Written mostly in blank verse, 
and in the lofty phrase of the gentlefolk of the 
sixteenth century, it would call for good reading 
on the part of actors and actresses ; but given 
these, there are enough dramatic moments, a clever 
enough plot and denouement, to make it a good 
acting play. Certainly, it would be interesting if 
offered by a company having poetic feeling and 
capacities of expression, and with an actor of the 
proper endowment to show us Shakespeare " in his 
habit as he lived." 

"The Tocsin," Mrs. Esther Brown Tiffany's 
drama of the Renaissance, is of the modern miracle- 
play type such as " Sister Beatrice " and others by 
Maeterlinck. The principal characters are an abbot 
and a nun. The scene is laid in 1586, first in 
Florence, afterward in Castle delle Torre outside 
the city of Pistoia. Its scenery and costuming 
would make this a beautiful " show " piece, but it 
is doubtful if anything but a picked audience of un- 
usual cultivation would enjoy its plot and dialogue. 
Mrs. Tiffany is to be congratulated on the beautiful 
form given to her book by the publishers, its 
Italian hand-made paper, its fine typography, and the 
charming binding of soft gray Fabriano boards. 

Another beautiful specimen of book-making is 
Mr. Gordon Bottomley's "Vision of Giorgione," 
which has all the dainty features we have learned 
to expect in a Mosher book. There is scarcely 
another painter of equal rank with Giorgione of 
whom we know so little. Vasari mentions his fond- 
ness for music and his love for a lady. This fur- 
nishes Mr. Bottomley the inspiration for his sequence 
of three poems (rather than dramas) called "A 
Concert of Giorgione," " A Pastoral of Giorgione," 
and "The Lady of Giorgione." The poet has caught 
the Venetian atmosphere very perfectly in his charm- 
ing verse ; perhaps he has also caught the secret of 
the painter's method in a passage such as this : 

" I pose models no more, 

But find adorable ladies with such fair minds 
They may be trusted to express themselves 
Graciously, perfectly in perfect gowns ; 
I ask them to come here quite half in secret, 
Wearing the gowns they think for quiet joy ; 
Sometimes I play them music of subtle discords, 
Or tell them casual fragmentary stories 
About the sudden things women do 
Which no man understands. And I watch, 
I paint and watch ; they think they are but broidering, 
Or wondering, or resting from their fate." 

The author of "A Garland to Sylvia" takes 
himself very seriously. A preliminary page of 
his book announces that " performances are forbid- 
den and right of representation reserved, under 
penalty provided by United States Statutes," of 
which Section 4966 is printed in full. A needless 
warning, one would say, for so thoroughly unactable 



a piece ! Needless also, and far too personal, seems 
the fifteen-page preface, recounting the composition 
of the manuscript, which was begun fourteen years 
ago, finished eleven years ago, and is now for the 
first time published, the eleven-year-old preface 
being included. Data so intime, in the case of 
youthful productions of a great poet like Tennyson 
or Browning after they have won their laurels by 
greater work, are sometimes worth while. They 
hardly seem so in this case of a Percy Mackaye. 
To be sure he has a certain knowledge of dramatic 
technique, with considerable poetic fancy ; and some 
of his plays have proved successful on the stage. 
But these are hardly sufficient in quantity or dis- 
tinguished enough in quality to give us a feeling of 
vital concern in his sophomoric efforts. Notwith- 
standing some pretty symbolism, and some pretty 
verse in terza rima, this " Dramatic Reverie " might 
well have been left in the seclusion where it had 
remained so long.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Roman relics Amon S visit rS J R me * a fa ' 
outside of the miliar commonplace that the longer 
Eternal City- vou 8 tay in that city the less you 
seem to know about it. So infinite is its variety of 
interest, so numerous are the inquiries it arouses as 
to its past, that the subject seems practically inex- 
haustible. But now an archaeologist, Dr. A. L. 
Frothingham of Princeton University, has given us 
a book on " Roman Cities in Italy and Dalmatia " 
(Sturgis & Walton) proving that no stay in the 
Eternal City, however prolonged, can ever be 
adequate for a study of Roman civilization, not 
because there is so much to see there, but because 
there is so little. So fragmentary are its ruins, so 
little is left in Rome itself compared with what we 
can find elsewhere in the Italian peninsula, that it 
is only by travel in these near-by regions that we 
can find answer to our most pressing questions. 
To discover what the early Romans wore and what 
they decorated their houses with, what were their 
religious rites and customs, we must explore their 
early tombs. But the number of such tombs in 
Rome is very small ; indeed, in such places as Alba, 
Praeneste, Veii, etc., there are necropoli far exceed- 
ing them in numbers, wealth, and extent of time. 
For a study of Roman architecture of the great 
style of the Empire, we have in Rome itself only 
the Cloaca and the Mamertine prison ; for a study 
of old stone walls, with their mounds and fosses, 
their towers and gates, almost nothing is left. For 
these we must go to Etruria, Umbria, Latium, and 
other regions farther south. Not until the reign of 
Augustus did the life of Italy become centralized 
in Rome itself ; and even after that time the 
fires and reconstructions of the Empire, quite as 
much as time and vandalism, helped to obliterate

or fundamentally deface all but a few works. 
Although Dr. Frothingham's book is written by a 
scholar and mainly for scholars, its style is so 
engaging, its comment so illuminating, that it can- 
not fail to command popular interest. The sixty- 
one full-page illustrations, with the maps, help us 
to answer the author's questions in his prologue : 
What remaining Augustan temple in Rome can 
compare in preservation with those of Pola and 
Assisi? What Augustan arches or gates with those 
of Agnino, Arsta, Rimini, Spello, Pola, and Verona? 
What bridges in Rome equal those of Narni, 
Spoleto, Rimini, and Vulci ? " Before going to 
Rome, it will not come amiss to anyone to read 
this instructive and agreeable book. 

Under the suggestive title -A 
Motle y" (Scribner) are gathered 
a number of Mr. John Galsworthy's 
" stories, studies, and impressions," written during 
the last ten years, and all but two published in vari- 
ous English periodicals. They all illustrate this 
interesting writer's remarkable power of using 
apparently commonplace material to present a pic- 
ture, delineate a character, or narrate an incident, 
with delicacy and vividness. In his pages, if any- 
where in contemporaneous literature, we find what 
a recent critic of current fiction was asking for, the 
fusion of " sympathy with sincerity and tenderness 
with truth." In a sketch of only three pages, for 
instance, Mr. Galsworthy moves the reader pro- 
foundly by bringing him face to face, in a French 
railway train, with a sick sailor sent on naval ser- 
vice to distant China, while his poor mother, whose 
sole support he is, remains at home to grieve over 
his going and perhaps to starve. "Tell me his 
eyes seemed to ask why are these things so? 
Why have I a mother who depends on me alone, 
when I am being sent away to die ? " The opening 
chapter, entitled "A Portrait," and now printed for 
the first time, is a masterly bit of description, almost 
without incident and thirty pages long, but so infused 
with life and reality as to hold the unwearied atten- 
tion of the reader to the end. Pathos and humor, 
which fill a larger place in life than do hilarity and 
merriment, are the prevailing note of the book, 
which might perhaps best be briefly characterized 
as a book of tears and smiles. 



One of the most careful and thor- 
ou gb * contemporary historical 
monographs is that by Mr. Julian 
S. Corbett on "The Campaign of Trafalgar" 
(Longmans). The battle itself, although treated 
with great fulness, occupies a very small part of a 
large volume ; for the book is an exhaustive study of 
causes and results. All the happenings in Europe, 
from May 1804 till December 1805, that had the 
remotest connection with the campaign and some 
whose connection is rather difficult to see are 
anxiously scanned for their bearing on the great 
sea-fight ; and the reader is constantly warned that 



all the events under consideration are bound into 
one great movement. This emphasis is a modem 
tendency that cannot be too highly approved ; )>ut 
Mr. Corbett's treatment of details is so exhaustive 
that it sometimes becomes difficult to see the city 
for the houses. He expresses surprise, in his preface, 
that the work he has performed so conscientiously 
should have remained so long undone, when >tudi-s 
of Waterloo, the great land-battle of the Napoleonic 
era, are numbered by the dozen. There are prob- 
ably several good reasons for this ; the best one is 
touched on by Mr. Corbett himself. Trafalgar did 
nothing for Europe, Napoleon was too quick and 
clever at Austerlitz, and a score of other points, 
for that, and Europe owes Nelson very little. 
Trafalgar did a great deal for England, it is true, 
not so much by securing the British Isles against 
invasion for they were never in real danger of 
invasion but by crushing the fleet that stood in 
the way of the English occupation of naval bases in 
the Mediterranean, thus securing and strengthening 
the British Empire; but its direct international 
significance was very small. Even the curtest of 
reviews must not neglect to mention the justice here 
accorded Lord Barham, the old First Lord of the 
Admiralty, who deserved quite as much credid for 
the success of the campaign as does Nelson himself, 
though he has received an astonishingly small 
amount of recognition from either his contempora- 
ries or their descendants. Mr. Corbett is Lecturer 
in History in the Royal Naval War College, and his 
somewhat technical and austere volume will prove 
especially interesting and profitable to the special 
student of naval affairs. 



For the bett <l ue8t M> n of what women's edu- 

education cat inn shall be has been debated so 

of women. i ong an( j M one _ 8 idedly that an 

impartial study of the matter is welcome. Dean 
Talbot's book on "The Education of Women" 
(University of Chicago Press) considers women's 
education from the standpoint of present-day social 
and economic needs, and is a concrete and definite 
study of these needs and the machinery for respond- 
ing to them, and of the changes necessary in our 
colleges and curricula in order to fit women for 
meeting the obligations of life more successfully. 
In Part I., women's activities, past and present, 
are discussed; Part II. deals with our educational 
machinery, and, among other things, includes a 
comparative study of the curricula of a woman's 
college (Vassar) and of a State university (Wiscon- 
sin) in the years 1861 and 1909. The conclusion 
is that education in the women's college* has become 
stereotyped around the classics and cultural studies ; 
while the State university, representing coeducation, 
has developed a superior type of training in prac- 
tical and scientific work. The writer strongly urges 
the changing of women's hitherto casual interest in 
social and intellectual affairs into a professional 
attitude toward work and study ; she advises choos- 
ing a profession early in the college career, and the

selection of courses that best serve that purpose. 
She makes very definite pleas for the training of 
women in practical affairs, in the arts of the home, 
and in child-rearing. "So far as the social and 
economic arrangements of society allot to men and 
women different tasks," she says, " so far must the 
educational machinery be developed differently for 
the two sexes. That both be treated according to 
sound psychological principles, while to each is 
given the opportunity for being trained for such 
social tasks as await the well-equipped member of 
a modern democratic community, is the ideal to be 
sought." The book is interesting and important, 
not only to educators, but to the wider public not 
so directly concerned in the training of women. 

The botany of the Naturalists of the "old school," who

revised to date. of Botany? feel especially friendly 

toward each new edition of Gray, and toward each 
new edition of other books which extend its method 
and its typography beyond the old bounds of the 
northeastern quarter of the United States. Notable 
among the outgrowths of Gray's Botany was Coul- 
ter's " Manual of the Botany of the Rocky Moun- 
tain Region," published in 1885. Excellent as this 
volume was, its very excellence soon threw it out of 
date. It gave the basis for more intensive work, 
especially of local botanists ; and this intensive work 
soon piled up the additions and corrections. The 
new edition of this work, by Professor Alven Nel- 
son of the University of Wyoming, brings the whole 
flora up to date. The classification is modern, begin- 
ning at the bottom, no longer with the " typical 
flower." The grouping of genera and species is 
along rational and scientific lines, neither radical 
beyond the facts nor conservative behind the times. 
The descriptions, after the fashion of those of Gray, 
are clearly written, condensed, and diagnostic, with 
helpful keys in the more difficult groups. The num- 
ber of species included is 2733, placed in 649 gen- 
era. The CompositCK are placed last, as the most 
complex of flowering plants. Not botanists only, 
but naturalists generally will appreciate this useful 
piece of work. 

The essays There is perhaps nothing in Francis 

of Franks Thompson's "Renegade Poet, and 

Thompson. Other Essays " (Ball Publishing Co.), 

that quite equals in critical insight and charm of 
style the author's posthumous essay on Shelley 
that article which startled " The Dublin Review " 
into an unheard-of second edition ; but there is 
enough here to make us glad that Mr. Edward J. 
O'Brien has collected these pieces into a separate 
volume. They range all the way from the playful 
humor of the first essay, that gives the title to the 
volume, to the effort in the manner of DeQuincey 
called " Moestitise Enconium," and the more labored 
narrative in the style of Poe entitled " Finis Coronat 
Opus." The humor that lightens up most of the 
book is never very brilliant, but it is also never tire- 



some. Occasionally back of the jest one sees the 
tragedy of Thompson's life, not obtrusive but none 
the less sure ; one hardly needs Mr. O'Brien's bio- 
graphical appreciation that introduces the volume, to 
guess how gloomy must have been the background 
of that life. In a criticism of Crashaw, Thompson 
reverts to the idea touched upon in the essay on 
Shelley, where he had said that "Crashaw and 
Shelley sprang from the same seed ; but in the one 
case the seed was choked with thorns, in the other 
case it fell on good ground." Both were in a way 
metaphysical poets, and one was no more a devo- 
tional poet than the other. Perhaps the most sug- 
gestive essay in the collection is that on " Paganism, 
Old and New." We cannot, and we should not if we 
could, bring back the old paganism when paganism 
was a faith ; that old paganism was without the two 
great factors in the beauty of modern poetry nature 
and love. The paganism we could bring back is 
that of the days of Juvenal, and it is this paganism 
"which already stoops on Paris, and wheels in 
shadowy menace over England." For us, the 
poetry of paganism "was born in the days of 
Elizabeth, and entered on its inheritance in the 
days of Keats." 

,,>,* " The Teachers of Emerson" (Stur- 

Sources of the v 

inspiration gis & Walton Co.), by Professor 
of Emerson. j ohn g. Harrison of Kenyon Col- 
lege, presents the results of a careful study which 
" has convinced the author that Greek thought has 
been the most important factor in Emerson's intel- 
lectual development." In three hundred and fifteen 
scholarly pages, duly provided with preface, foot- 
notes, bibliography, and index, he points out Emer- 
son's indebtedness to Platonist and Neo-Platonist 
thought throughout his works, both prose and poetry. 
It is an impressive exhibit,- but not a surprising one, 
since we are all familiar with the prevailing trend 
of thought in our New England Plato. Rather 
unaccountable in so thorough a sifting of relevant 
material is the omission of the Emerson Journals, 
two volumes of which appeared last November, five 
months before the issue of Mr. Harrison's work. 
The Journals, however, so far as published, lend no 
great strength to the theory of Emerson's predomi- 
nant indebtedness to Plato and the Greeks ; for the 
non-Hellenic authors quoted and referred to in their 
pages are greatly in the majority. And so Mr. 
Harrison's book is really a study of but one phase, 
though a most important one, of Emerson's mind.

THE DIAL, 



[August 1, 



Gompers was interested chiefly in conditions of 
labor in the various countries that he visited, such 
problems as unemployment, poverty, and related 
topics, having his special attention. Impressions of 
various other aspects of English and Continental life 
are included, however, and contrasts with American 
manners and customs mentioned, all in a keen, if 
not profound, fashion. In addition, there are a few 
chapters on more general subjects, in which such 
matters as " Tipping Systems," u Railway Travel," 
" Plain Water and Pure Air," are treated with 
sound common-sense. The book as a whole has in 
it a considerable number of facts interesting to the 
student of labor problems ; its main value lies, how- 
ever, in the first-hand impression that it gives of 
the life and work of the laboring class in Europe. 
That it is written by a man with an obviously strong 
bias for labor-unionism and a sharp eye for the 
good results of that system, need not bother anyone 
who makes the proper allowances. 

The outlook There have been so many books in re- 
for women in cent years recording various persons' 
Wfttem Canada, impressions of Canada and things 
Canadian, that one is inclined to doubt the probability 
of a new volume in this field containing anything 
particularly new or informing. Mrs. (Van's book 
A Woman in Canada " (Lippincott), has the merit 
of approaching what is after all a pretty big subject, 
from a comparatively fresh point of view. She tells, 
in a very entertaining way, the story of a journey 
through Western Canada, made with the specific 
object of studying the conditions from a woman's 
standpoint, and for the particular benefit of English- 
women who might have pluck and determination 
enough to face the hardships of pioneer life for the 
sake of winning an independence. After a careful 
examination of the conditions, her conclusion seems 
to be that there are splendid opportunities in Western 
Canada for women of the right class ; and if they 
should grow tired of an independent existence, there 
are scores of young bachelor fanners in the West 
who will be only too glad to join forces with tmm. 

Mrs. VUliers-Wardell's "Spain of 
the Spanish" (Scribner) treats fully 
and intelligently of life in Spain 
at the present day the court, the press, the theatre, 
literature, commerce, sports. The work belongs to 
the realistic rather than the romantic school of hooka 
descriptive of Spain, and gives accurately-stated 
facts instead of fleeting impressions. The bull-fight 
chapter, for instance, tells the rules and customs 
that govern the performance ; the various acts, or 
tuertes, are described, and even the costumes of the 
performers are pictured in detail. The principal 
living torreros are characterized, the breeding and 
handling of the bulls explained, the cruelty of the 
sport discussed giving the Spaniard's point of 
view, and an idea is given of that important 
organ, the bull-fight press; so that the reader is 



provided with definite information upon which to 
form opinions. This chapter is characteristic of 
the book, which treats, as stated in the Introduc- 
tion, of Spain of the Spanish, not of Spain of the 
English. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



" The Century Dictionary " has recently extended it> 
scope by the inclusion of two supplementary volumes, 
prepared under the editorship of Dr. Benjamin K 
Smith. The new volumes are not only as thorough and 
elaborate in every respect as the originals, but are 
perhaps even more completely the work of specialists. 
Some idea of the additions included may be gained 
from the following rough summary : New Words, New 
Meauings of Old Words, New Encyclopedic Articles, 
New Foreign Words and Phrases, Slang Words and 
Colloquialisms, Trade- Names, New Abbreviations, Sim- 
plified Spellings, and Proper- Name Additions and Cor- 
rections. Seventy-nine collaborators have been engaged 
upon the Supplement, which, together with the original 
volumes, now includes about five hundred and fifty 
thousand words. 

The first in order of Professor Bronson's " English 
Poems " (University of Chicago Press), and the last to 
appear, covers the period from 450 to 1450. The 
Anglo-Saxon poems are done into modern prose, the 
work of Mrs. Bronson, who has preserved as far as is 
possible the flavor of the original. The Middle F.nglish 
poems have not been adapted for the benefit of the 
modern reader, who can, however, by the aid of notes 
and glossary, interpret the text without much trouble. 
The whole series is intended for use in college classes. 
Chaucer is represented by the " Prologue " and the 
" Nonne Preestes Tale," both complete. There are 
eighteen entire ballads and two fyttes of the " Gest of 
Robin Hood." Types of mediaeval drama are furnished 
in the Chester " Deluge," the Coventry " Abraham's 
Sacrifice," " Everyman," five scenes from the " Mar- 
riage of Wit and Science," and Heywood's "The Four 
PP." Notes, glossary, and bibliography make up the 
critical material. 

A child's life of St. Francis by the late Sophie Jewett 
of Wellesley College has just been published by Messrs. 
T. Y. Crowell & Co. Under the title " God's Trouba- 
dour," the lovely mediaeval story is told with a charm 
of literary distinction such as rarely goes into the mak- 
ing of a book for young readers. One likes to think 
what it will mean to those who, however unconscious 
of the art behind its sweetness, will follow the boy 
Francis from the time when, at the gates of Assist, 
he welcomed home his splendid merchant father, 
through the years of his gay young manhood, to that in 
which mystic, saint, and gentlest lover of men he 
wandered on moonlit hillsides among the sleeping shep- 
herds and dreamed of Bethlehem ami the little Christ : 
or how, blessing bird and beast and flower, suffering, 
toiling, yet God's sweetest singer still, he waited till the 
coming of his " Sister Death." The story is full of 
vivid sketches of thirteenth century Italy, with now 
and then a word of present-day Umbria, which the 
photographs scattered through the book aptly illustrate. 
Some paintings of the early Italian masters have been 
reproduced for their concrete suggestions of old days ;

and the translations from Italian songs and lyrics 
further enhance the old-world atmosphere which per- 
vades the volume. 

Although Mr. Carleton Noyes has entitled his mono- 
graph " An Approach to Walt Whitman," his little 
book of 230 pages is such a summing-up of the poet as 
will be best enjoyed by one who is already a disciple, 
and most useful to one who is familiar with Whitman's 
work. It is a quite just appreciation of the author of 
"Leaves of Grass," obviously sympathetic but altogether 
sane. There are few biographical details ; fewer, even, 
than in Isaac Hull Platt's little volume on Whitman, 
in the " Beacon Biographies." As an interpretation of 
Whitman, however, Mr. Noyes's book deserves a place 
with Carpenter's " Whitman " in the English " Men of 
Letters " series, and Perry's " Walt Whitman, His Life 
and Work." The chapter on " Whitman's Art " is clear 
and sound. Mr. Noyes has a pleasing style a style 
free from the strain for paradox or epigram. The book 
is published by the Houghton Mifflin Company and is 
handsomely issued, containing a reproduction of the 
poet's best-known portrait. 

The two volumes of Schipper's " Englische Metrik " 
were published in 1881 and 1888 respectively, and in 
1895 an abridgment of this work, called "Grundriss 
der englischen Metrik"; now, fifteen years later, ap- 
pears the first English translation of the shorter work 
by Professor Schipper himself, under the title " A 
History of English Versification " (Oxford University 
Press). This is more, however, than a mere trans- 
lation; the first few chapters have been "somewhat 
more fully worked out," and errors noted hi the 
" Grundriss " have been corrected. The first book 
treats of the line, the second of the structure of the 
stanzas. It would have been better if the word "verse" 
had been used throughout instead of " line," if for no 
other reason than the sake of uniformity. Thus, in 
Book I., Chapter X., there is a discussion of the three- 
foot line, and in the chapter immediately following, of 
the rhymed five-foot verse. The general tendency 
to-day is to use verse for the older line and stanza 
for the older verse. There is unfortunately no index, 
but this lack is partly made up by a full table of con- 
tents. 

Professor Charles Werner's " Aristote et Pide'alisme 
platonicien " (Paris, Felix Alcan) is a volume in the 
series entitled " Collection historique des grands phi- 
losophes." A comparison with the volumes already pub- 
lished in the Scribner's " Epochs of Philosophy," or the 
Dodge Company's " Philosophies Ancient and Modern," 
shows that they do things differently, if not better, in 
France. This volume is a much more serious and 
severe piece of work than any contributor to an Amer- 
ican or English series of the kind would venture to 
offer the public. It is a close but lucid metaphysical 
analysis of the more abstract parts of the Aristotelian 
philosophy, with especial emphasis on their relation 
to Plato. The more humane and concrete works of 
Aristotle, the Ethics, Politics, Rhetoric, and the biolog- 
ical writings, are practically ignored. The work is well 
done, but this is hardly the place to attempt a summary 
of it. The most important new result reached is that 
Aristotle's God is the soul of the world. There is much 
to be said against this view. But even those who can- 
not accept the author's conclusion will learn something 
from following the course of reasoning by which he 
arrives at it. 



NOTES. 



An edition of the late Sophie Jewett's complete 
poems is announced for fall publication by Messrs. 
Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. Those who are acquainted 
with the rare quality of Miss Jewett's poetic work will 
look with interest for this volume. 

From Messrs. Stanley Paul & Co., of London, comes 
the first issue of a new monthly periodical, christened 
" The Beau," devoted to " the science of pleasure." It 
is well printed, artistically decorated, illustrated in 
etchings and photogravures, and seems to be of rather 
varied interest, containing articles ranging from " The 
Future of Marriage " and " The Sanctity of the Eccen- 
tric" to "The Woodcuts of Ellen Thesleff" and 
" Pavlova and the Spirit of Dancing." 

Messrs. Duffield & Company's list of books for the 
autumn includes " Chantecler " in English; H. G. Wells's 
" The New Machiavelli "; Marguerite Bryant's " Anna 
Kemburn, Truthseeker " ; Richard Dehan's "One 
Braver Thing"; Mrs. Sharp's "Memoir of William 
Sharp"; Esther Singleton's "Furniture"; "Heroic 
Spain," by E. Boyle O'Reilly; "Sketches and Snap- 
shots," by the Right Hon. G. W. E. Russell; Christian 
Tearle's "Rambles with an American"; "Socialism 
Past and Present," by G. R. S. Taylor and others. 

The handsome new " Memorial Edition " of Mere- 
dith, published by Messrs. Scribner, has now fourteen 
volumes to its credit, comprising the following titles : 
" The Shaving of Shagpat," " The Ordeal of Richard 
Feverell," "Rhoda Fleming," "Evan Harrington," 
"Sandra Belloni," " Vittoria," "The Adventures of 
Harry Richmond," " Beauchamp's Career," and " The 
Egoist." Each of the last five titles mentioned com- 
prises two volumes. A special feature of this edition 
will be found in the illustrations, which consist of 
photogravure reproductions of the author's portraits, 
homes, and the scenes associated with his novels. 

Dr. Johann David Schoepf 's " Reise durch einige der 
mittlern und siidlichen vereinigten nordamericanischen 
Staaten, 1783-84," translated by Mr. Alfred J. Morri- 
son, is announced for early publication. Dr. Schoepf 
was a surgeon in the German division of the British 
army, who, on coming to this country, set out from 
New York and spent ten months in the examination of 
the coast states as far south as St. Augustine. He was 
a trained observer, and did much good work in the 
study of North American geology, materia medica, 
fishes, and meteorology. As a contribution to the his- 
tory of the Confederation, his forthcoming work is un- 
doubtedly of value. 

Among the Houghton Mifflin announcements of books 
for the coming season are the following: "John Win- 
terbourne's Family," by Alice Brown; " A Man's Man," 
by Ian Hay; "The Meddlings of Eve," by William J. 
Hopkins; "The Empty House, and Other Stories," by 
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps; The Battle of the Wilder- 
ness," by Morris Schaff; "The Corsican: A Diary of 
Napoleon's Life in his Own Words," compiled by R. M. 
Johnston; "Our House and the People in It," by 
Elizabeth Pennell; "In the Catskills," by John Bur- 
roughs; " The Digressions of V," by Elihu Vedder; and 
"John Brown: A Biography, Fifty Years After," by 
Oswald Garrison Villard. In addition to these are holi- 
day editions of Bret Harte's " Salomy Jane," Brown- 
ing's " Pippa Passes," Mrs. Wiggins's " Rebecca of 
Sunnybrook Farm," and Mrs. GaskelFs " Cranford."

JAMES M. BARRIE 

UNINTERESTING SOUVENIR OF 
TWO FAMOUS LITERARY MEN 

NEITHER DORKING NOR 
THE ABBEY By j. M. BARRIE 

OF the many tributes to George Meredith 
called forth by his death last May, prob- 
ably the most appropriate and beautiful was that 
contributed by Mr. J. M. Barrie to "The West- 
minster Gazette" of London, under the title 
"Neither Dorking nor the Abbey." That this 
brilliant little essay may not be lost to the many 
who love both Meredith and Barrie, we have 
issued it in attractive booklet form, printed on 
handmade paper and silk-stitched in blue hand- 
made paper wrappers with printed title -label. 
There is a brief prefatory note, and appended are 
Thomas Hardy's fine verses on the death of Mere- 
dith. As the edition is limited, orders should be 
sent at once. Price, 50 cents, postpaid.

OUR LITERARY LOVES AND HATES. 



To have any positive literary likings and 
dislikings at all, is a gain which often is rated 
at its real worth only after years of fancied or 
outwardly-imposed literary tastes and distastes. 
To have read " Paradise Lost " three times, and 
to be able to tell why it is numbered among the 
masterpieces of the world's literature, is good as 
far as it goes, and it may go far toward refin- 
ing the taste and making it impossible to en- 
joy unreservedly a metrical performance like 
" Lucile "; but it need not mean that one heart- 
ily and spontaneously revels in the grandeurs 
and sublimities of Milton's epic. The proudly 
acknowledged favorites of those young readers 
who are something better than frivolous readers, 
or readers of cheap sensationalism, are and must 
be, as a rule, the books they have been taught 
to believe they ought to like, not necessarily 
the books they voluntarily choose out of a whole 
library. What then is the sense of dismay and 
confusion with which the adult reader one day 
discovers that what he has always supposed he 
had a real preference for is after all far from 
being what he instinctively and temperament- 
ally craves, and what he now recognizes as his 
proper literary pabulum ! The mingled aston- 
ishment and self-reproach and sense of enlarge- 
ment at so astounding a revelation to oneself of 
one's previous conscientious dishonesty (for such 
it really is) bear a close resemblance to those 
feelings of combined remorse and freedom with 
which one at last discovers if he belong not to 
the class of those who never attain to the power 
and privilege of thinking for themselves 
how small a hold on his inmost convictions 
some of the traditionally-held tenets of his relig- 
ious faith actually have. That there is not, as 
we had supposed, one and only one road to sal- 
vation, either intellectual or spiritual, for the 
whole world, is at first a disconcerting but after- 
ward a more and more exhilarating discovery. 
We too it dawns upon us help to determine 
what books shall be profitable for edification 
and shall survive the literary deluge. Even 
our weak hands aid in building the ark whence 
shall step forth on some distant Ararat the 
authors chosen out for rescue from a speedy ob-

livion and for the future guidance and uplift of 
the race. 

But beyond the fact that readers as a whole 
decide the fate of writers, and that certain gen- 
eral kinds of books are, and so far as we can 
see always must be, esteemed superior, and 
Ttuiii other kinds inferior, there is world-wit It- 
room for difference of opinion in the judgment 
of literature, and there are boundless possibi- 
lities of unforeseen developments in both the 
taste> of readers ami the ju-oduetions of writers. 
The only thing to be counted on with certainty 
is that the unexpected will surely happen with 
refreshing frequency on both sides. 

The curiosities of individual taste that tend 
to puzzle the philosopher would form a list long 
enough to circle the globe. Why, for example, 
should the sane and sensible Macaulay, of vast 
reading and of unusual powers as a writer of 
solid and enduring books, have revelled in 
Richardson's pitilessly spun-out essays in didac- 
tic sentimental ism'.' " Clarissa Harlowe," he 
told Charles Greville, he could almost restore 
if it were lost, which is far more staggering 
than his reputed ability to reproduce Paradise 
Lost." Even bluff old Johnson, the uncom- 
promising foe to all namby-pambyism, and 
known to have acknowledged to Boswell that 
" you would hang yourself from impatience " if 
you read Richardson for the story, held his 
novels in high esteem and commended their 
author as the first to teach the passions to 
move at the command of virtue. Lady Mary 
Wortley Montagu, who declared that Richardson 
knew nothing of the manners of good society, 
could not help weeping "like a milkmaid " over 
" Clarissa." A certain Dutch minister, Leslie 
Stephen tells us, even went so far as to main- 
tain that parts of this novel, if found in the 
Bible, would be " pointed out as manifest proofs 
of divine inspiration "; and Rousseau, in a letter 
to d'Alembert, avows that there is in no 
language a romance equal to or approaching 
"Clarissa." But any robustness of appetite on 
Rousseau's part for sentimental mush served in 
quart bowls need not greatly astonish one. In 
fact, there is in one sense nothing surprising in 
the admiration professed by any of these per- 
sons for the frothy sentiment of Richardson : it 
was less a case of individual bias of judgment 
than of yielding to a prevalent frenzy like 
the tulip craze that once swept over Holland, 
or the mania for monstrous hats that now pos- 
OMCO the women of two continents. 

In Mr. John Graham Brooks's recent excel- 
lent biography of William Henry Baldwin, .Jr.. 



there is printed a part of a letter from Baldwin 
to an intimate friend, in which the writer speak* 
affectionately of his small library <>f fan-fully 
selected volumes, all fondly read and re-read, 
and clung to in preference to any later or less 
trustworthy candidates for his favor ; and among 
the few he mentions by name is " Marius," as 
in need of a new binding. Assuming "Mariu- 
the Epicurean " to have been meant, we ask 
ourselves why this manager of railroads and 
active director in many great business corjxmi- 
tions, this social reformer and trustee of Tu- 
kegee, this friend of the negro and worker for 
the uplift of the poor in the South, this broad- 
minded and large-hearted philanthropist whom 
the oppression of the Jews in Russia and the mas- 
sacre of the Christians in Armenia alike moved 
with wrath and pity, why should he, of all 
men, go to Walter Pater, the secluded aesthete, 
the Aristippus of Oxford, the coiner of exquisite 
phrases, for spiritual or intellectual sustenance ? 
What could there possibly have been in com- 
mon between the minutely painstaking, the all 
but pedantic, author of "Marius," fashioning 
and re-fashioning his periods with the laborious 
nicety of a mediaeval monk illuminating a pre- 
cious manuscript, and the executive head of large 
undertakings in the modern world of affairs ' 
It is a clear case of the attraction of opposite-,, 
and is capable of no more logical explanation. 
But in the very unaccountability of our literal \ 
likings lies the strongest proof of their genuine- 
ness. The things that are real in this world 
have a way of l>eing inexplicable, or ultimate. 
What rests on a reason needs still another 
reason to support the first, and so on in infinite 
regression. 

But with all this arbitrariness of individ- 
ual choice there are, fortunately, some general 
bounds set to the play of whim and caprice in 
the selection of books. Otherwise the pub- 
lisher's business would be an even more ha/ 
ardous enterprise than it is, and the conduct of 
public libraries to the general contentment of 
the average reader would be rendered far more 
difficult. The mental and moral atmosphere 
of any particular period is the atmosphere 
breathed, perforce, by all who live at that time. 
Our standards of taste are, far more than \ve 
like to admit, determined for us, and it would 
be extremely difficult if not impossible for any 
one of us to develop a consuming passion for 
Paphlagonian poetry or for Tishbite drama 
when no one else in the world was similarly 
moved. Almost equally difficult, it is true, do 
some aggressively independent persons find it 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



81 



to acknowledge a liking perhaps even to feel 
it for what all the rest of the world happens 
just then to be reading and praising. And so 
we demand, in degrees varying with each indi- 
vidual, some friendly approval of our literary 
loves, some cordial endorsement of our literary 
hates, inasmuch as we are all human ; and also 
we occasionally welcome from others some 
measure of disapproval and some inability to 
sympathize and understand, in order that we 
may thereby flatteringly persuade ourselves of 
our own marked individuality and intellectual 
superiority. 

But here we seem to be approaching the 
region of psychology, whose deep waters do not 
invite our present sounding. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A KEAL "FIND" BY A PUBLISHER'S READER is 
an event so rare, as has been said by one of our 
genial literary essayists perhaps Curtis or Howells, 
or someone who knew whereof he spoke that 
when the patient literary purveyor discovers such 
a treasure among the reams of uncompellatory 
manuscripts through which he plods his weary 
way, he is so elated that he goes about clapping 
his friends on the shoulder and inviting them to 
take a drink with him in celebration of his luck. 
Some such spiritual exhilaration would have been 
pardonable, we fancy, to the reader for Messrs. 
Houghton Mifflin Company when the manuscript of 
"Enchanted Ground" swam into his ken. The 
joyous event must have diffused an atmosphere of 
cheer through the sedate establishment on Park 
Street, and brought prosperity to the more hilarious 
centres of culture variously located on Tremont 
Street and Beacon Hill. And now the book is 
issued, and the public become sharers in the joy, 
not necessarily to celebrate its advent with libations, 
but to delight in it and go about telling their story- 
loving friends how good it is. For that it will be 
a favorite seems to us a safe prediction. It has 
freshness, novelty, delicate fancy, and sparkling 
humor, innumerable graces of style and warm 
human interest of character and story that come 
like a grateful breeze across the arid waste of much 
of our contemporaneous fiction. The people whom 
we meet and never meet too often in these 
diverting pages are not theatrical figures from an 
artificial stage, but real persons from real life, the 
life of now and here. It is in New York our 
modern Babel that the story is laid; the city of 
Power, of Ambition, but most of all the city of 
Youth. And this is a story of Youth its trials 
and struggles, its temptations and dangers, its 
triumphs and defeats; Youth, that finds here its 
Enchanted Ground, where it may dream and strive 



but must be ever vigilant, upon which save at its 
peril it must never sleep. It is like the place of vigils 
of the " Virginians of the Valley," where 

"Still the 'Golden Horseshoe' knights 

Their old Dominion keep ; 
Whose foes have found Enchanted Ground, 
But not a knight asleep." 

We know not if the title of this book was derived 
from Ticknor's poem, but the lines quoted might 
fitly have been placed on the title-page. It does 
not lessen the charm of the work to find its author, 
Mr. Harry James Smith, a comparatively unknown 
writer. We recall a short story by him, published 
in a magazine a few years ago, which left a distinct 
impression of power and fine literary workmanship. 
He appears also as the author of " Ame'de'e's Son" 
on the title-page of the present volume. He cer- 
tainly is a writer of promise. He works in his 
own field, and his touch is all his own ; his style is 
singularly pleasing, devoid of affectation or man- 
nerism although we wish he had been satisfied 
with but one use of a word so dubious as indicible. 
But why speak of fly-specks on a fabric so finely 
wrought? One such episode as that of the old 
Frenchman (a famous chef in his time), and his 
wife, making a surreptitious pigeon-pie from a pet 
pigeon, and, after the fatigue of the achievement, 
calm'y going to sleep beside the oven where the 
wonderful pie is burning to a cinder, alone compen- 
sates for the reading of the book. And there is 
no part of it which, once begun, is likely to be left 

unread. 



THE LEGEND OF WASHINGTON'S PROFANITY AT 

MONMOUTH will doubtless survive, in company with 
the venerable tradition of the cherry-tree incident, 
with the oft-repeated assertion that men and women 
were burned for witchcraft at Salem, with the too- 
good-not-to-be-true story of Emerson's and Margaret 
Fuller's ecstatic comments on the dancing of Fanny 
Elssler, and with countless other picturesque falsifi- 
cations of historic fact. The latest refutation of the 
swearing incident comes from the pen of Marion 
Harland (in her recently-published autobiography) 
on the authority of a Revolutionary veteran, one 
Sterling Smith, who was uncle to the autobiog- 
rapher's grandfather. "He did not swear," declared 
the old soldier vehemently. " I was close behind 
him and I can tell you, sir, we rode fast when 
what should we meet running away, lickety-split 
from the field of battle, with the British almost at 
their heels, but Gen'ral Lee and his men. Then, 
with that, says Gen'ral Washington, speaking out 
loud and sharp says he, 'Gen'ral Lee, in God's 
name, what is the meaning of this ill-timed pru- 
dence ?" : Lee's answer, as given by Smith, was 
this: "I know of no one who has more of that 
most damnable virtue than your Excellency." And 
so, according to this witness, we have Washington 
indulging in nothing worse than a justifiable invo- 
cation of the Deity, and Lee garnishing his reply 
with a veritable swear-word. When John Fiske, 



THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



fifteen yean ago, delivered at Charlottesville his 
lecture on " Charles Lee, the Soldier of Fortune," 
and alluded therein to this Monmouth incident, one 
of his hearers related to him from memory, and 
afterward reduced to writing at his request, the 
testimony of another Revolutionary veteran, one 
Major Jacob Morton, who claimed to have been 
within a few yards of Washington when the historic 
utterance was made. "My God! General Lee, 
what are you about?" was Morton's version of the 
passionate speech; and he added that when Lee 
attempted to explain his conduct, the other, his 
hand lifted high as when he had first spoken, waved 
it angrily and cried, " Go to the rear, sir ! " Then 
he spurred his horse and rode rapidly forward. 
" The whole thing occurred as quickly as I can tell 
it to you," concluded the major, who, we are assured, 
was a man of well-known honesty, courage, and 
integrity. Fiske's lecture, with foot-note account of 
Morton and his report of the incident, is contained 
in the first volume of his posthumous " Essays, 
Historical and Literary." 



THE PICTURESQUE SUPERFLUITIES OF SPEECH, 

in any living language, are surprisingly numerous. 
By picturesque superfluities we mean those collo- 
quial and sometimes illogical additions that help to 
make a phrase or sentence more unmistakable or 
more emphatic in its meaning than if stripped of 
all but the strictly necessary elements. In these 
days of horseless vehicles by the tens of thousands, 
and of reckless chauffeurs at the steering-wheel, it 
is not astonishing that every week we read of some 
automobile as having "turned turtle "; and recalling 
from the happy days of childhood the helpless aspect 
of a mud-turtle on its back, we gain an immediate 
and vivid conception of the automobile's sorry 
plight. To turn, or to turn over, or to upset, would 
be strictly sufficient, and would satisfy the purist, 
but would not appeal so strongly to the imagina- 
tion. House and home, might and main, toil and 
moil, by hook or crook these are familiar exam- 
ples of the emphasis gained by repeating an idea 
in other terms. To stick fast, to stop short, to join 
together, to rise up, to sink down, to cry out, to 
issue forth, such instances of verbs redundantly 
helped out by prepositions or adverbs are innu- 
merable. It is as if the mind were not nimble 
enough or adaptable enough to grasp a quick suc- 
cession of naked statements ; some loosely fluttering 
rags and strings of amplification must be appended 
to arrest attention and facilitate assimilation. Is 
not this one reason why none of the now numerous 
artificial languages has made much headway in its 
linguistic conquest of the world ? It is as if the 
stomach were offered pure carbon, hydrogen, 
oxygen, and nitrogen, and told to digest them and 
build up thereon the bodily tissues. One of the 
more recent of these made-to-order tongues (the 
" Universal " language, we believe) has now with- 
drawn from the field in favor of French, its 



inventor perhaps p-rr-iving the hopflfsMu-ss of try- 
ing to foist on the world a mere skeleton of sym- 
bols under the name of a language. No more than 
man himself can a language, or a system of ortho- 
graphy, for that matter, live without " atmosphere." 



THE PRESERVATION OF NEW ENGLAND ANTIQUI- 
TIES is to be systematically undertaken by a so- 
ciety just organized, with headquarters at No. 20 
Beacon Street, Boston, whose purpose is to rescue 
from destruction or obliteration historic dwelling- 
houses, famous taverns, memorable battle-fields, etc., 
a museum being in contemplation for the housing of 
such movable material as shall be from time to time 
acquired. Civilized man differs from the savage 
in liaving a past and a future. The relics of our 
past have hitherto been treated with insufficient 
respect The Hancock mansion on Beacon Hill, for 
example, than which no finer or historically more 
interesting example of colonial architecture could 
have been found, was torn down in 1863 partly 
because Governor Hancock died before giving testa- 
mentary expression to his alleged intention of leav- 
ing the house to the Commonwealth, and partly 
because the legislature sitting in 1863 was too little 
enlightened and liberal to authorize the purchase of 
the famous building when it was offered at a low 
valuation. Such blunders and omissions it is the 
aim of the new society to guard against in the future. 
The first number of its Bulletin is an illustrated 
prospectus. Among the score of historic old houses 
pictured in its pages one fails to note that oldest 
and not least important of famous New England 
homesteads, the so-called Cradock House of Mt*<l- 
ford, which dates back to about 1634 and is still in 
an excellent state of preservation, thanks to certain 
timely repairs. The society invites correspondence 
from those desiring to join its membership, or who 
are otherwise interested in its work. 



EAST VICTIMS OF SUPERSTITION are commonly 
found among actors, artists, musicians, young lovers, 
and others who, whether temporarily or habitually, 
live much in their emotions and let their reason 
slumber. To the ardent Romeo, his dreams " pres- 
age some joyful news at hand " on the very eve of 
his learning that Juliet "sleeps in Capel's monu- 
ment." The veteran dramatic critic, Mr. George 
P. Goodale, contributes to "The Dramatic Mir- 
ror" some striking instances of actors' superstition. 
Edwin Booth cherished a shuddering abhorrence 
for the peacock's feather, a particular hoodoo of 
stage-folk. Upon the completion of Booth's Theatre 
in New York, a valued friend presented the actor- 
manager with a fine stuffed peacock of brilliantly 
iridescent tail. Unwilling to offend by declining 
the gift, Booth placed it on top of his oVsk. l.ut 
presently declared to another friend that the new 
playhouse was doomed. A few years later he 
walked out of its doors bankrupt in purse and void 
of hope all on account of that fatal peacock ! Mr.

Robert Edeson, no neurasthenic victim of wanton 
fancies, is said to insist on carrying in his pocket, 
when he goes on for the opening scene in a play, 
a bit of the greased paint from the stick used by 
him in his first make-up for the professional stage. 
Mr. Frank Mclntyre, the corpulent comedian, owes 
his confidence before the public to the presence on 
his person of the drawstring from the football suit 
he wore in "Strongheart." We have heard in 
regard to a certain well-known actress that she 
could not be cured of her mania for picking up pins 
in her walks, until a mischievous friend had strewn 
her path with these toilet accessories from her hotel 
to the theatre where she was playing, thus compel- 
ling her to do violence to her pet superstition or to 
miss her engagement. Probably there is no one, 
however severely rational, but keeps some little 
corner of his mind for unreason to run riot in. Life 
were otherwise too desperately a thing of causes 
and effects, a monotonous chain of antecedents and 
sequences. , 

AN INDIGNANT DENIAL OF AUTHORSHIP is Sent to 

his American publishers by Mr. H. G. Wells, who 
professes inability to "understand the mental quality 
of the people who can suppose that I " we quote 
his own words "should deliberately write a lying 
preface over my own signature to a book by myself, 
stating in the clearest manner that I did not write 
it." The book in question is, of course, the much- 
talked-about " George Meek, Bath-Chair Man, by 
Himself." Absurd, preposterous, impossible, that 
he should have written it, declares the affronted 
author of " Mr. Polly " and " Kipps " and " Ann 
Veronica." " George Meek is a very real and 
inimitable human being," he continues, in the same 
tone of outraged innocence and grieved surprise, 
" and I am about as capable of fabricating his work 
as he is of fabricating mine. Will you kindly make 
this denial public in whatever manner you think 
best." And meanwhile the sale of " George Meek " 
goes merrily on, which may possibly soothe the 
perturbed feelings of the man who is not George 
Meek. Why is not this the " psychological mo- 
ment " to bring out a new edition of the book with 
a frontispiece portrait of Mr. Meek (pushing his 
bath chair) and an appended affidavit, duly signed 
and witnessed, of his veritable existence and his 
actual authorship of his bona-fide autobiography? 
What a convincing retort that would be to these 
doubting critics of honest George ! 


A THOUSAND-DOLLAB PRIZE FOR THE BEST BOYS* 

STORY, the first considerable prize ever offered for 
juvenile fiction, is announced by the Messrs. Jack 
of Edinburgh. Two hundred pounds is the exact 
size of this tidy premium, and, like the recent prize 
offer of 250 from Mr. Andrew Melvose for the 
best novel, it is likely to evoke manuscripts from 
many new authors ; like that also it may lead to 
the publication not only of the prize-winning story 
but also of the second and third best productions. 



Thus is talent rightly stimulated, and " good stuff " 
for young readers brought to light. The commit- 
tee of award in this instance might well be made 
up from among the brightest youngsters from the 
Edinburgh public schools. Boys know what they 
like, and are frank in their opinions if given a fair 
chance to state them. 



COMM UN 1C A TION. 



THE QUESTION OF "IMMORAL DRAMA." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Your correspondent M. C. A., in your issue of Aug- 
ust 1, argues for the essential validity of the statement, 
" There is no such thing, per se, as an immoral subject 
for a play." It should be noted that a critic of this 
dictum is not required to maintain that the subject is 
immoral, per se, but only that it is immoral for a play. 
I should certainly hold that there is no subject which 
may not be discussed in a moral manner, but that it 
may be so discussed in a play presented to the general 
public does not seem to follow. Nobody would dispute 
the statement that there are substances which, per se, 
are unfit for human food; is there not some analogy 
between our physical and intellectual pabula? The dis- 
tinction between immorality and bad taste is perhaps 
not so fundamental as M. C. A. maintains. An immoral 
thing is one which is contrary to prevalent customs or 
practices considered good. Literally, only acts can be 
immoral (remembering, however, that in this sense a 
thought is an act); certainly science and philosophy 
must maintain that an immoral subject is an impossibility. 
Thus, although the statement criticised and defended is 
in reality perfectly plain, it should have read, " There 
is no subject, the representation of which in a play ne- 
cessarily constitutes an immoral act." The imagination 
of any reader should be sufficient to picture situations 
in which this would not be true. 

Is it immoral to offend good taste? It must be 
remembered that all things are good or bad, moral or 
immoral, as in the long run they affect our thoughts 
and feelings. Surely it is illogical to argue that the 
offense ceases to be immoral in its nature when it affects 
them immediately and directly. Nevertheless, there is 
a real distinction, based on the fact that " good taste " 
in a number of matters is not universal. When I say 
a thing is immoral, without qualification, it is generally 
understood that it is contrary to established good custom. 
When I say it is in bad taste, I may be taking the 
liberty of assuming that my personal taste is a valid 
standard to go by, and am rarely supposed to be assum- 
ing that the offended " taste " is even nearly universal. 
On the contrary, while everyone claims to possess 
" good taste," all admit that it is very rare. It is be- 
cause of this that I am not at liberty roundly to declare 
plays "immoral" because I detest them; but 1 may 
nevertheless conclude, after due meditation, that plays 
which I detest have an injurious effect on those who 
like them, and are, broadly and ultimately, subversive of 
the great established good purposes and ends of society. 
When I am convinced of this, I call them immoral, and 
thank my " good taste " for leading me to see the light.

[August 16, 



"CHANTECLER" IN ENGLISH. 

M. Rostand's "Chantecler" has been "done 
into English/' and is now to be had complete 
in book form. It is a prose translation, made 
by Miss Gertrude Hall. The question of an 
English version has been much discussed, and 
it must be confessed that the possibility of 
an adequate one is by no means proved even 
now. If " Chantecler " were primarily gallina- 
ceous, our idom might assimilate him ; but he is 
first of all Gallic, and he must, in spite of the 
translators, remain essentially Gallic to the end. 
As the national bird of France, his naturaliza- 
tion among us is about as problematic as that 
of the lion and the unicorn " in the old song ; 
and a single glance at the dumpy hang-tailed 
rooster, depressingly realistic, on the cover-page 
of a popular magazine, destroys all idea of his 
equivalence to the rooster rampant of the 
French louis rf'or, cocksure and splendid, with 
swelling throat and proudly flaunting tail. Yes, 
il y a une difference. " Cockadoodledoo " has 
but a hint of the clarion ring of the French 
"cocortco"; we have no fabliaux or traditions 
of military glory to exalt and magnify the figure 
of the humble guardian of the poultry-yard, 
and our gold-pieces, unlike the French ones, 
bear a bird quite different from a crowing 
chanticleer. The mere idea of a barn-yard 
drama, therefore, impresses many of us a* 
ridiculous There is little to excite the Anglo- 
Saxon imagination in this unnatural apotheosis 
of the ruler of the roost. 

It is, indeed, more than likely that, except for 
some fugacious curiosity, this is the real Amer- 
ican attitude toward Rostand's classic drama. 
The critic may talk as he please, the student 
and cosmopolite cry foul play, but the fact re- 
mains that national prejudices are untrans- 
latable. Besides, it is extremely doubtful if 
domestic animals can be domesticated on the 
American stage. In general, we have no deep 
fellow-feeling for the animals, in spite of the 
success of the immortal Peter the Monk in 
dramatic vaudeville. Of course, Rostand's 
characters are not, aufond, animals. His psy- 
chology and his use of the emotions are abso- 
lutely human, since his characters are men 
disguised two-legged animals with feathers, 
contravening the Aristotelian definition ! 

But Aristotle and the question of Rostand's

ornithological orthodoxy will take us too far 
afield. Let us get back to " Chantecler." We 
had been led to believe, all along, that this trans- 
lation would be in verse ; not in alexandrines 
perhaps, but in appropriate pendecasyllabics. 
That was our dream of an English translation 
of " Chantecler," and the prosaic reality of the 
outcome is a disappointment. Yet Miss Hall 
has given us admirable verse translations of the 
French poets, and the charm and faithfulness 
of her versions of Verlaine make one regret 
that she neglected the opportunity afforded by 
Rostand's " Prologue " and the much-belauded 
"Hymn to the Sun." The prologue-poem, a 
veritable lyrical overture, strikes the keynote 
for the whole play ; and its rendition into prose, 
with over six stanzas omitted, is the first sacri- 
fice made to the pedestrian muse. After the 
Prologue they follow thick and fast : onomato- 
poetic effects, puns (not all translatable, to be 
sure), bits of dialogue, etc. Of course it was 
to be expected that liberties would be taken 
with the French ; but if they are taken, the 
retention of the graceful lightness of the orig- 
inal should ever be the end in view, and it must 
be admitted that parts of this translation re- 
mind one too strongly of the incorrect correct- 
ness of the classroom. On the other hand, 
many of the puns are imitated in the English, 
often with considerable ingenuity, and the gen- 
eral faithfulness of the work is worthy of high 
praise. 

One lays down the volume, however, with a 
definite conviction of the impossibility of trans- 
lating Rostand. "Chantecler" in English is 
not " Chantecler " at all ; nor could it ever be. 
The outlines, the colors, may be copied well 
enough, but the life, the spirit, the esprit which 
give to the original its light and fragile grace, 
are not to be recaptured in another tongue. 
One could instance a hundred untranslatable 
lines. It is a pity but " Chantecler " in 
English can never be more than a colored 
photograph, a tissue-paper butterfly. We are 
afraid there is no help for it : we must brush up 
our rusty French if we are to enjoy " Chante- 
cler." Fortified with patience plus a dic- 
tionnaire d'argot, we can easily get into the 
spirit of the original, and in the French we 
shall find that " Chantecler " has both rhyme and 
reason. We may miss some of the puns, of 
course, but in the sum total of Rostand's too 
abundant wit we may well lose them. We shall 
lose none of the onomatopoetic beauty of the 
French ; we shall miss none of the poetry ; nay, 
we may get from the play more than if we saw

it on the stage. Reports from France tell of 
many disappointed spectators, and, indeed, 
to one who has read the play in the French it 
is evident that actors short of the very best 
could hai'dly fail to spoil it. With Guitry 
himself in the title role, did not Paris regret 
the exuberance of Coquelin? 

Let us, then, keep away from the theatre and 
read " Chantecler," if we can, in the original. 
Inferior to " Cyrano " as a drama, it is perhaps 
equal to it as a dramatic poem ; and the second 
act, with its exquisite picture of the sunrise, has 
a lyrical breadth and sweep that Rostand has 
never surpassed. The poem has a moral, too, 
which we shall not discuss, save to say that the 
splendid courage of the disillusioned hero is a 
keynote of the French character which Anatole 
France, with his deterministic pessimism, some- 
times makes us forget. Read "Chantecler." 
With all its excess of technique, with all its stren- 
uous virtuosity, it teaches a lesson of strenuous 
virtue. LEWIS PIAGET SHANKS. 



A VOLUME OF UISTKETICESTT MEMOIRS.* 



Princess Helene von Racowitza, who served 
George Meredith as a model for his heroine in 
" The Tragic Comedians," offers her autobiog- 
raphy to the world with the prefatory warning 
that it is not intended for "timid souls or 
conventional thinkers, nor for those who are 
prudishly inclined or narrow-minded." Her 
reminiscences of a brilliant and rather tempestu- 
ous life have been written, it appears, "for eman- 
cipated people for those independent souls 
who, having reached the pinnacle which stands 
above all conventions, look forward to the time 
when each one will be free to form his own life 
according to his individuality, untrammelled 
by social or family prejudices." That she has 
written with freedom and frankness, her pages 
leave no room for doubt ; and while some of her 
disclosures might well have been reserved for 
her father-confessor, that thought seems not to 
have occurred to this broad-minded and inde- 
pendent lady. Certainly the story of her life 
reads like fiction, and may be of interest not 
only to those who knew her while she was in 
this country, but to all who enjoy a volume of 
sprightly memoirs. 

Madame von Racowitza's heritage was un- 
usual. Her father's family was originally a

Swedish-Norwegian one, directly descended 
from the Vikings, with the fiercest of Norse 
blood in their veins ; her mother belonged to 
one of the old and highly cultured Jewish 
families in Berlin, whose members during the 
eighteenth century gave to the world poets and 
philosophers such as the Ashers, Mendelssohns, 
Beers, and even Heinrich Heine. During 
Helene's childhood they lived in Munich, where 
their salon was the resort of eminent men and 
women, poets, artists, scholars, and of those 
then known in Berlin as the " ^Esthetes." 
Helene's vivid temperament seems to have 
asserted itself even at this early period, accord- 
ing to an incident she relates of herself which 
occurred before she was a year old, while her 
parents were staying with the Crown Prince and 
Princess of Bavaria. One morning her mother 
left her in the castle garden in care of a nurse 
whose blithe dismissal of responsibility left 
Helene quite alone, crying broken-heartedly. 
The young crown princess, hearing the cries, 
hurried in their direction, and discovered the 
child lying face downward on the grass. On 
being carried to her mother, she shook the 
baby's fist at Madame Donnige, saying " Little 
Helene must not be deserted like this; she is 
born to be loved, and will cry herself to death if 
she is left alone " a commentary which was 
not without significance during the events of 
her later life. 

Heleiie's early education included little that 
was conducive to ideals of a moral or religious 
nature. The atmosphere in which she lived 
she describes as that of an eighteenth-century 
novel : " I never remember that anything in 
our house was considered reprehensible except 
' bad manners,' awkward speech or intonation, 
all and sundry that jarred upon the sense of 
beauty. In my father's as well as my mother's 
family there was an absolutely fanatical love of 
beauty. . . . Morals were of secondary consid- 
eration, although lying was strictly forbidden." 
At the age of twelve she was taken to private 
balls, and from that time on was made love to 
" officially," as she puts it. In describing the 
impression she made at that time, she quotes 
from Baron Voldendroff , who thus speaks of her 
in his "Remembrances of an Old Miinchner'': 

" I entered the blue drawing-room, but rny feet were 
arrested on the threshold by a wonderful picture. The 
sun's rays fell on the figure of a young girl who sat in 
the window niche a girl of such extraordinary beauty 
that I instinctively held ray breath in order not to dis- 
turb this creature out of a fairy tale. Dainty and win- 
some as a fairy, with sharply cut profile, in which the 
slightly aquiline nose and the finely drawn mouth were

conspicuous, she sat or rather reclined in the chair, her 
little head drawn back, as if by the weight of the glori- 
ous golden hair; her eyes were bent dreamily on the 
distance. And what eyes! Later on I often looked 
into them, but do not know yet what colour they are, 
whether grey, blue, or green. They continually changed 
colour; sometimes they wore the most gentle dove-like 
expression, sometimes particularly when the heavy 
lids half hid them as if in fatigue they Hamed like 
eyes of a beast of prey. ... At the noise of the clos- 
ing door, she turned her head towards me and said 
with the greatest aplomb, < Mamma is not here, but she 
will come directly, do sit down.' I mentioned my 
name, upon which she made a graceful bow, and I 
greeted her with the words, ' I suppose you are the 
Helene we have been expecting from Berlin? ' Quite 
right,' was the reply; and thus I beheld for the first 
time the enchantress Helene, who in later years was so 
passionately beloved and so bitterly reviled." 

It was soon after this that her mother forced 
her into an engagement with a profligate Italian, 
whose suit, thanks to her kindly and clever 
grandmother, did not prosper. Once rid of the 
odious Italian, however, it was not long before 
she entered upon her first real love-affair, to 
which she abandoned herself so intensely that 
Baron von Kotzebue said of it later: I have 
witnessed three elemental forces in my life. I 
have been in a typhoon ; I have seen one of the 
greatest volcanic eruptions of this century ; and 
I was a spectator of Helene von Donnige's first 
love." Unable to obtain her parents' consent 
to a marriage with the charming Russian officer, 
she spent a winter with her grandmother in 
Berlin, where, while calling upon the heavens 
for a Southerner with hot blood in his veins," she 
met Yanko von Racowitza, her dream of a dark 
fairy prince her " Moorish page," as she often 
called him. He it was who later shot Lassalle, 
and whom Helene afterward married regard- 
ing him as Lassalle's " innocent murderer." 

On the eve of her promise to Yanko to 
marry him if she did not find some one whom 
she could love far better, and if she did not go 
on the stage," she met Lassalle for the first 
time; and as the principal interest in her life 
attaches to her relationship with the French 
revolutionist, it is not amiss to quote her descrip- 
tion of the event which had such tragic conse- 
quences. She was in a friend's drawing-room, 
sitting in the background that she might listen 
to the great man before meeting him. 

"The folding doors opened, and two gentlemen 
stepped with the host into the lighted drawing-room. 
I do not know why, but having heard continually of 
Lassalle's mind and erudition, I had imagined him to 
be a little man with strongly marked Jewish feature*. 
As a matter of fact I had not thought much about his 
personal appearance, and one of the men was exactly 
as I have described. With him entered a tall figure 
with a Cfesar-like head and expression. It never en- 



tered my head that this could be I^assalle the little 
Jew must be he! Clever men are ugly ; but the tall, im- 
posing one began to speak, and I forgot all else. I could 
only listen and listen, and at hut, in a Hash, I realized 
that it mus< be he and no other. Everyone in tin- room 
listened spellbound to his conversation, \s liu-h was stormy 
and powerful, sweeping over everything 1 had hitherto 
considered as unalterable and sacred. ... 1 listened 
entranced, enthusiastic, but nevertheless not agreeing 
with everything he was saying Suddenly I sprang up, 
and forgetting that this man had never seen me, I inter- 
rupted him by exclaiming, ' No ! 1 do not agree with 
you there.' For one moment he stopped; the eagle 
glance of his commanding blue eyes was directed upon 
me, then a smile crept over his classic features, and 
stepping up to me he said softly, ' Ho, ho ! so this is 
what she looks like ! I thought so ! That 's all right. 
And ' laughing heartily ' No is the first word I 
hear spoken by this mortal ? ' It was all over. In that 
very first moment he could have said that which he did 
a little later : We both knew that we had met our 
destiny in each other.' The people around us were for- 
gotten. . . . We remained together the whole evening. 
When at last my relations got up to leave, Lassalle 
came out into the hall with me, wrapped me up care- 
fully in my cloak, and, impatient at the long farewells 
in the drawing-room, opened the door of the flat, lifted 
me high in his arms, and carried me down stairs. No 
protest was made by me at such an absolutely incredible 
proceeding. It all seemed to me so natural, so much a 
matter of course . . . and when we arrived at my own 
door he said to me, Tomorrow I am coming to grand- 
mamma to get her consent ! " 

The subsequent story of their engagement is 
well known, Helene's failure to obtain the 
consent of her parents, their shameful mistreat- 
ment of her in their effort to break off the 
match, the consequent misunderstandings and 
loss of faith which culminated in the duel be- 
tween Lassalle and Yanko. 

" Now followed in my life months of sorrow beyond 
description. To be obliged to remain with my detested 
parents and to see no deliverance but in a marriage 
with the man who, even although he had not wished it, 
was still the murderer of Ferdinand. . . . Can one 
imagine a more terrible situation ? The apathy I have 
already mentioned had taken possession of me and pro- 
tected me during the earlier time from some desperate 
act. Poor Yanko surrounded me with such tender care, 
lamented and wept so bitterly with me over my fate 
that at last I pitied him even more than I did myself. 
In my eyes I have said it thousands of times, and can 
only repeat it again and again the murderer of Los- 
salle was not Yanko, but my father. Yanko had been 
forced into the appalling situation. They had bewil- 
dered his not too keen understanding with false notions 
of honor: persuaded him he must take my father's 
place and save my honor, which had been tarnished 1>\ 
Lassalle and the countess. In short, they had forced 
the weapon into his hand with which he, without wish- 
ing it (that I can swear before God and everything I 
hold sacred), had killed the man for whose sake he had 
really meant to sacrifice himself." 

After their marriage, Yanko lived only a short 
time; and Madame Helene came to America 
with Serge von Schewitech, with whom she

afterward went through the marriage ceremony 
three separate times. For a woman with so fine 
a disregard of the conventions, this certainly 
seems a little superfluous. The remainder of 
the volume is devoted chiefly to her twelve 
years' career as actress and author in this coun- 
try. The portraits and other illustrations with 
which the volume is embellished add not a 
little to its attractiveness and interest. 

MARGARET C. ANDERSON. 



THE GREATEST OF THE SEVENTEENTH 
CENTURY LYRISTS.* 



To draw a parallel between Herrick and 
Swift seems at first sight preposterous, so radi- 
cal are the differences in their characters and 
works ; but one can hardly read through Pro- 
fessor Moorman's interesting study of Herrick 
without observing striking similarities in his 
career to some in Swift's. Both were early left 
to the care of an uncle for support, one losing 
his father shortly after, the other before, birth ; 
both found London their most congenial abode, 
and both accepted ecclesiastical appointment 
away from London ; both liked their rustic par- 
ishioners none too well, and uttered their discon- 
tent at their necessary retirement in bitter 
words ; both regarded less the sanctities of their 
profession than the cakes and ale of the joyous 
secular world ; both wrote some verses more 
remarkable for their trenchancy of sentiment 
than for their delicacy of expression. But in 
their characteristic literary work they are the 
poles asunder : one is the sweetest singer of the 
Caroline lyrists ; the other is the most vitriolic 
of the prose satirists of the reign of Anne. 

We do not know a great deal of the life of 
Herrick, and we cannot draw with safety bio- 
graphic inferences from his poetry. Professor 
Moorman has brought together all the facts fur- 
nished by a careful examination of the records 
and a judicious study of Herrick's work, and 
still there are large gaps unfilled. We know 
that he disappointed his uncle, the " close-fisted 
old knight " Sir William Herrick, when he re- 
fused to follow the latter's profession as a gold- 
smith and entered Cambridge at the mature 
age of twenty-two, and that he spent most of his 
spare time in college writing his uncle for money 
to meet his bills. The letters still exist as 
damning evidence against the old curmudgeon, 
who would not give his nephew what was right-

fully his. He also studied law at Cambridge, 
partly because he could live more cheaply at 
Trinity Hall than at St. John's. When he came 
up to London, after graduation, he apparently 
dropped the law and became, what was much 
more congenial, the music at the 

" lyric feasts, 
Made at the Sun, 
The Dog, the Triple Tun," 

and dedicated verses to " Saint Ben, to aid me." 
Here he had many mistresses to inspire his 
verse, but they seem to have been mainly poetic, 
whether they are known as " stately Julia, 
prime of all," or as the more matter-of-fact 
Mistress Elizabeth Wheeler. He chose rather 
to " follow the primrose path' of dalliance," 
enjoying to the full the pleasures of London, 
and taking no thought of the morrow. 

" I fear no earthly powers, 
But care for crowns of flowers; 
And love to have my beard 
With wine and oil besmeared. 
This day I '11 drown all sorrow ; 
Who knows to live to-morrow?" 

But the morrow brought with it unexpected 
change, and in 1629 Herrick became vicar of 
Dean Prior in Devonshire. The thought of his 
new life inspired him to indite his verses bid- 
ding farewell to poetry and to the jolly company 
of Ben Jonson and his fellows in their London 
tavern. His new life was the cure of souls, not 
the music at the feast. But this life was not 
so dull and dismal as it seemed to him then 
and has seemed to many readers of his poems. 
Professor Moorman shows that his verses 
expressing his dislike for Dean Prior and his 
parishioners belong to the later years of his 
stay there, when his Cromwellian flock were in 
strong opposition to him as their royalist vicar 
and were of course prevailing. It was then that 
he broke out into diatribes against them as 
" A people currish, churlish as the seas, 
And rude almost as rudest savages;" 

and of the place thus : 

" Search worlds of ice, and rather there 
Dwell than in loathed Devonshire." 

That he sang of " May-poles, hock-carts, wassails, 
wakes," as charmingly as he did of Julia and 
the liquefaction of her clothes, shows that he 
found pleasure in life, even though it was not 
in London. And his relations with his people 
were on the whole pleasant, even though it is 
recorded on doubtful authority that he one 
time threw his sermon at his congregation, with

insufficient evidence that be kept a pet pig, 
which he taught to drink out of a tankard, and 
to know that some of his " Noble Numbers " 
were handed down for one hundred and fifty 
years by oral tradition in the place where he 
ministered. At the end of eighteen years he 
went back to London, in 1647, as one of the 
44 on ted " clergy, who refused to subscribe to the 
Solemn League and Covenant. What else he did 
in London besides publish his Hesperides " 
and 44 Noble Numbers," we do not know in any 
detail; we do know that he returned to Dean 
Prior in 1662 and that he died in 1674. 

The second part of Professor Moorman's work 
is a critical study of Herrick's poetry, the lyr- 
ical and non-lyrical poems of the 4t Hesperides " 
and the " Noble Numbers," and a discussion of 
the relation of the Elizabethan to the Caroline 
lyric. Professors Schelliug and Wendell hold 
that the latter shows signs of degeneration in 
its evolution from the former ; Mr. Swinburne 
saw in the work of Herrick the culminating 
glory of the lyric in this continuous period. 
Professor Moorman maintains that the differ- 
ence is one of kind rather than of degree, and 
to prove his contention he outlines the develop- 
ment of this form in its various manifestations. 
There is the native product that reached its 
culmination in the matchless songs of the 
Shakespearean plays; there are the madrigals 
that came in under Italian influence, and the 
sonnets that were introduced by Wyatt and 
Surrey, both kinds in the main art-lyrics that 
lack the spontaneity of the native songs ; and 
there are the verses of the 44 Miscellanies " 
which glow with the Italy of the Renaissance, 
and of which we have a famous example in 
Marlowe's exquisite 44 Come live with me and 
be my love." This poetry is that of a nation 
in the first glory of adolescence, whose move- 
ments have an indefinable rhythmic grace, and 
whose outlook upon the world is untroubled by 
care or misgiving. It is a lyric which re- 
creates for us the golden age long dreamed of 
by the poets of antiquity." But this lyric is 
rarely intense, individual ; it does not reveal 
the recesses of the poet's soul. The Caroline 
poets, on the other hand, do reveal personality ; 
and the first of them, Donne, lays bare his soul 
in every line he writes. For him his verse is 
the 44 cry of an intense and passion-swept soul." 
Thus, as the lyric became more subjective, it 
became more and more formally excellent, more 
and more a work of art. And the great agents 
in achieving this result were Ben Jonson, and 
through him the Greek and Latin poets, 



Anacreon, Catullus, and Horace. The conclu- 
sion is therefore that, though there may IK? a 
44 loss of spontaneity, tunefulness, and at times 
of idyllic beauty, there is an immense gain in 
all that pertains to art. A sense of form and 
of structure manifests itself; and the lyric, 
sacrificing romantic charms, wins instead a cer- 
tain classic grace. . . . The seventeenth cent M r\ 
brought to lyric poetry the sense of individual- 
ity, the personal note, the lyrical cry of a 
human soul amid its pleasures and its pains. 
its hopes and its fears." 

And of the seventeenth century lyrists, Her- 
rick was the greatest. He had Jonson's classi- 
cism without his pedantry ; he becomes so 
much a pagan at times that we have to stop and 
reflect that he was a clergyman of the Church 
of England. His anacreontics are as good as, 
and in his noble flights better than, Anacreon 's. 
Lowell has called Herrick the 44 most Catullian 
of poets since Catullus," and in many respects 
this is true, though as a love poet he is far in- 
ferior to the Latin singer, since he never knew 
the pain that pierced the heart of Catullus. 
44 By thine own tears thy song must tears beget." 
Perhaps more than to any other, Herrick's sym- 
pathies went out to Horace, both in respect to 
his philosophy of life and a kinship of tastes, 
and in their, fine confidence in the immortality 
of their work. Among his contemporaries, 
Donne, and still more Jonson, influenced him ; 
and yet to both he rises superior both in range 
of subject and in delicacy of touch. 

May we agree, therefore, with Professor 
Moorman, and regard Herrick, the leading 
lyrist of the Caroline poets, as different only in 
kind and not in degree from the Elizabethans? 
His poetry is individual, personal ; he has 
brought the lyric to an artistic excellence which 
undoubtedly surpasses anything attained by the 
earlier poets. But this very excellence is one 
of the marks of decadence, when it is not 
accompanied by intense feeling. And Herrick 
did not love deeply ; he did not drink the cup 
of life to the lees, whether the draught was of 
joy or pain, and in his verse we do not get that 
intense cry that marks the supremest lyric utter-

with emotions comes perilously near insincerity ; 
and it, along with the absence of any soul- 
stirring emotion, marks the waning of the 
"golden summer of the English lyric," as Pro- 
fessor Schelling says. Yet the waning is beau- 
tiful, for it was that of the most rapturous period 
in our literature, when the world was still young 
and men had not lost all their illusions. So it 
is that " in holiday mood, we turn to the 
' Hesperides,' and find refreshment of soul in 
the contemplation of an age that knew little of 
misgiving or disillusionment, and of a poet in 
whom, beneath the garb of an Anglican clergy- 
man, there beat the heart of a votary of Apollo, 
' for ever piping songs for ever new,' and bidding 
us gather rosebuds while we may in the bowered 
glades of Arcady." JAMES W. TUPPER. 



LAKE GEORGE AXD LAKE CHAMPLAENT.* 

From that memorable day in July, 1609, 
when Champlain with his party of Algonquin 
warriors defeated the Mohawks, two centuries 
of conflict have been waged about the beautiful 
shores of the lake that bears his name. Lake 
Champlain and Lake George stood on the main 
thoroughfare between the French and English 
colonies, which was also the war road of the 
Iroquois. From 1609 to 1814, men struggled 
for their possession : at first the Indian and the 
French, then the French and British, finally the 
British and American. A century of peaceful 
occupation followed, and in 1909 the descend- 
ants of the warring nations came together on 
this historic spot to celebrate the tercentenary 
of its original discovery. As in the case of the 
similar celebrations at Quebec and New York, 
the Lake Champlain Tercentenary has given 
birth to a considerable body of special literature 
which, if not particularly original or historically 
important, at least serves to keep alive popular 
interest in the subject. 

To this literary aftermath of the Lake Cham- 
plain commemoration belongs Mr. Max Reid's 
handsome volume on " Lake George and Lake 
Champlain." Starting with that sturdy ex- 
plorer and colonizer, Samuel Champlain, he 
traces the story of the lakes through three 
centuries of discovery, warfare, and peaceful 
development. A chapter is devoted to discus- 
sing the probable site of Champlain's battle 
with the Mohawks in 1609, the author making

copious quotations from an interesting mono- 
graph by Dr. George F. Bixby, tending to show 
that Crown Point, rather than Ticonderoga, 
was the scene of the conflict. In later chapters 
he summarizes the early history of the Mohawks, 
the Jesuit missions among the Iroquois, the 
Caughnawaga settlement on the St. Lawrence, 
the building of Ticonderoga and its dramatic 
history, the connection of the lakes with the 
French and Indian wars, with the conquest of 
Canada in 1759, with the American invasion 
of 1775, and with the War of 1812. Inter- 
spersed in the narrative are Indian legends 
and pioneer reminiscences bearing on the his- 
tory of Lake Champlain and Lake George. 
These latter form by all odds the most interest- 
ing, and probably the most valuable, feature of 
the book. They constitute in many cases a dis- 
tinct addition to our knowledge of the region, 
and, while far enough from historical accuracy, 
throw light on the men and manners of a 
bygone age. Mr. Reid is at his best in telling 
the legend of Theretee. Another story, lacking 
the romantic charm of that of Therese, but not 
altogether devoid of dramatic interest, is the 
Iroquois legend of the mosquito. While per- 
haps not historically important, and possessing 
no very special bearing on the history of Lake 
Champlain and Lake George, the subject is 
timely enough to bear quotation. 

" There were, in times of old [so the legend runs] 
two feathered monsters, permitted by the Manitou to 
descend from the sky and light upon the banks of the 
Seneca river, near the present route of the canal, at 
Montezuma. Their form was that of a mosquito, and 
they were so large that they darkened the sun like a 
cloud as they flew between it and the earth. Standing, 
the one on one side and the other opposite on the other 
bank, they guarded the river, and stretching their long 
necks into the canoes of the Indians as they attempted 
to paddle along the stream, gobbled them up as the 
stork king in the fable did the frogs. The destruction 
of life was great, for the embargo was so strictly 
enforced that an Indian could not pass without being 
devoured in the attempt. It was long before the 
monsters could be exterminated, and then only by the 
combined efforts of all the warriors of the Cayuga and 
Onondago nations of Indians. The battle was terrible, 
many warriors being slain by being transfixed with 
their dagger-like bills or trampled upon by their huge 
feet, while large war canoes were overturned and their 
occupants drowned, by a single blow of their ponderous 
wings. But the warriors finally triumphed, and the 
mammoth mosquitoes were slain. But sad to relate, 
as their huge carcases decomposed in the sun, every 
particle became vivified and flew off daily in myriads 
of clouds of mosquitoes. And they have filled the 
country ever since." 

It is difficult to understand why Mr. Reid 
should have thought it necessary to pad out his 
book by quoting verbatim a couple of chapters

again rent by the reiterated huzzas of the Green Moun-

and reverberating mountains of the country around, the 
proclamation of victory ! the first triumph of Young

A RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONARY ox THE 
FRENCH REVOLUTION.* 

The French Revolution was made up of so 
many diverse currents that the task of inter- 
preting it justly is sometimes facilitated by 
studying the impressions it has left upon the 
minds of men of widely varying convictions 
and temperaments. For example, the student 
who would be far from following M. Jaures in 
his programme of social change may profit by 
reading his volumes on the Revolution, because 
their approach to many of its problems is free 
from the distorting effect of traditional pre- 
judice, and because they emphasize sympatheti- 
cally everything that concerned the fortunes of 
the common people. In the same way, one has 
a right to expect from a revolutionary like 
Prince Kropotkin some suggestive interpreta- 
tions. To a certain extent the reader of this 
volume will not be disappointed. Prince Kro- 
potkin has meditated upon the subject a long 
time. It is twenty-five years since he began his 
investigations of the peasant risings in France, 
with the aim of throwing light on the economic 
history of the Revolution. Although his book 
includes the general history of the movement, 
it is the economic aspects that he treats with 
fulness. One or two questions notably the 
disposition of the communal lands or commons, 
ordinarily neglected he discusses at consider- 
able length. Upon everything that touches the 
abolition of the feudal system he also enters 
into detail. Unfortunately, the value of his 
work is seriously compromised, and for some 
readers will be destroyed, by his failure to com- 
ply with the one essential condition of cogency,

tin- use of none but proved or provable facts, 
ignoring idle or malicious rumors, even if they 
conveniently confirm fixed prepossessions. 

At the outset, one is met by swiping but 
questionable generalizations upon the aims of 
the leaders in 1789. We are told that they 
" meant to concentrate all governmental power 
in the hands of a central executive authority, 
strictly controlled by the Parliament, but also 
strictly obeyed in the State." There is no hint 
here of that administrative anarchy, that fatal 
scheme of decentralization, which is the ]>eculiar 
feature of the constitution built up by the Con- 
stituent assembly. To his imaginary consti- 
tution, Prince Kropotkin attributes in part a 
sinister aim. '* By the side of this concentra- 
tion," he says, " they intended to proclaim 
complete freedom in commercial transactions, 
and at the same time to give free rein to indus- 
trial enterprise for the exploitation of all sorts 
of natural wealth, as well as of the workers, 
who henceforth would be delivered up defence- 
less to any one who might employ them." He 
discovers all through the Revolution a settled 
purpose on the part of the middle class (and 
in this class he places the well-to-do farmers) to 
decide every question to 'their economic advan- 
tage ; in other words, to " exploit" the situation, 
to substitute themselves for the clergy and the 
nobility as the privileged class. This is the 
reason, he thinks, why there was such a wide- 
spread desire on the part of the villagers to 
divide the commons, instead of leaving them 
intact as communal property. 

Of the middle class, as well as of the nobles 
whom they drove from power, Prince Kropotkin 
is ready to believe every damaging rumor, or, 
rather, he accepts rumors unhesitatingly, as if in 
such a case evidence is not required. Apropos 
of the ReVeillou riot, he repeats one of the slan- 
ders of the day, to the effect that Reveillon had 
made himself especially prominent 1 >y the bru- 
tality of his remarks to the poor, and had said, 
" The working man can live on black bread 
and lentils : wheat is not for the likes of him." 
In order to justify the murder of Flesselles, 
he alludes to an apocryphal correspondence. 
Although he has M. Flammermont's account 
of the fall of the Bastille before him, his own 
account contains a strange admixture of the 
rumors that were flying about Paris on that 
momentous fourteenth of July. He still be- 
lieves that the uprising of the city nipped in the 
bud a scheme of the government to dissolve the 
Assembly, punish several of its leaders, and 
crush Paris in case of resistance, although the

existence of such a plot was disproved by M. 
Caron two or three years ago in the Revue 
cTHistoire Moderne. He repeats the old story 
that Foulon " had promised to make the people 
of Paris eat grass " in explanation of his cruel 
fate later in July. It is needless to add in- 
stances of the historical method illustrated in 
this volume. 

The case would not be serious were individual 
facts the only matters treated in such fashion. 
The account of feudal property is equally regard- 
less of evidence. " Formerly," he remarks, 
" the whole of the land meadows, woods, 
waste lands, and clearings had belonged to 
the village communities. The feudal lord held 
the right of administering justice over the 
inhabitants, and most of them had also the 
right of levying various taxes ... in exchange 
for which the lords were pledged to maintain 
armed bands for the defense of the territory.'' 
This may have been partially true of Russia, 
but such theories cannot be transferred bodily 
to mediaeval France. Furthermore, the treat- 
ment of the abolition of feudalism is rendered 
inexact by the author's failure to refer to the 
texts of the several laws in the Duvergier col- 
lection. It must be repeated that discussion, 
or interpretation, is possible only if the simple 
principles of historical evidence are treated as 



constant factors.

SOME VOLUMES OF AMERICAN VERSE.* 



A striking commentary upon the indifference of 
our public toward the higher forms of literary 
expression is afforded by the note with which Dr. 
Weir Mitchell prefaces his latest volume of poems. 
He confesses to having published six volumes of 
similarly modest dimensions before the present one, 
and tells us that the average edition was of " two 
or three hundred copies, with an average sale of 
about fifty copies." A selected volume published in 
London " had a still more brilliant success than its 
predecessors in America. In all, eighteen copies 
sold in the first year, and, so far as I know, none

since." Thinking that he would like to get posses- 
sion of the remainder of this English edition, the 
author discovered that he could not have it sent to 
him, because some of the poems were copyrighted 
in America, and our exasperating laws forbade the 
importation. We tell the rest of the story in Dr. 
Mitchell's own words: 

" Accordingly, I desired Mr. Macmillan to burn the rest 
of the volumes or to consign them afresh to the paper-mill to 
serve for reincarnation of the poems in some more fortunate 
form. I asked also that fifty bound copies be sent to 
America. They were promptly stopped in the New York 
Custom-House. A book said to be copyrighted in America, 
printed in England, returned to America, the law forbids to 
enter. I asked what should be done with them. Might I 
buy them? I could not. I believe it was finally concluded 
to cremate them. 1 ' 

Truly, it is discouraging to be an American poet. 
One cannot sell his poems, and one cannot get 
possession of them to give them away ! And Dr. 
Mitchell, as our readers well know, is a serious poet 
whose work fairly belongs to literature in the refined 
and restricted sense. If one were in doubt of this 
proposition, " The Comfort of the Hills, and Other 
Poems " would alone be enough to convince. It is 
a slender sheaf, but the grain is ripe and golden. 
We need do no more by way of evidence than quote 
these stanzas from the titular piece : 

" The years that come as friend and leave as foe, 
The years that come as foes, and friends depart, 
Leave for remembrance more of joy than woe, 
All memory sifting with Time's gentle art, 
Till He who guides the swallow's wintry wing 
Gives to our grief-winged love as sure a spring. 

"The mountain summit brings no bitter thought; 
And in my glad surrender to its power, 
Familiar spirits come to me unsought, 
But unto thee, my child, the twilight hour, 
When level sun-shafts of the waning day 
Their girdling gold upon the forest lay. 

" Here, long ago, we talked or silent knew 
The woodland awe of things about to be, 
And, as the nearing shadows round us drew, 
Some growing sense of unreality, 
Ancestral pagan moods of far descent 
That thronged the peopled woods with wonderment. 

" Art with me now, and this thy gentle hand ? 
Or is it that love's yearning love deceives, 
And in too real a solitude I stand, 
Hearing no footfall in the rustling leaves, 
Sole comrade of far sorrows, left alone 
The awakened memory of a dream to own. 

" Slow fades the light of day's most solemn hour. 
The autumn leaves are drifting overhead. 
In vain I yearn for some compelling power 
To keep for me these ever-living dead. 
Peace, peace, sad heart ; for thee a gentle breeze, 
God's angelus, is sighing in the trees." 

There are not many poets living who could match 
these grave and lovely lines. 

This fine sonnet "To Virgil " is from the "Poems 
of Belief " of the Rev. Theodore C. Williams, who 
has perhaps been more successful than any other 
translator in turning the " JEneid " into an English 
poem:

THE DIAL 



[August 16, 



" Thy Rome died many deaths. Her native power 

By alow diseases, such aa nations know 

When liberty ia lost, became a ahow 
And pageantry for slaves ; then came the hour 
Of outward death, aa when a withered flower 

Falls in a tempest ; o'er her lying low 

The barbarous legions in resistless flow 
Rained aeaa of death on temple, street, and tower. 

" Bat than, imperial Virgil, couldst not die. 

Still through strange seas thy storm-tossed Trojans fare ; 

Thy visions live ; thy voice is singing still. 
We wanderers in a vaster West descry 

New worlds, new sorrows: but true hearts that bear 
The sacred past, seek Heaven's prophetic will." 

This is one of a group of several sonnets of equal 
distinction. Mr. Williams also writes stately blank 
verse, exemplified by such poems as " Seneca on 
the Soul " and " Ave Roma Immortalis." But the 
prevailing note of his volume is religious, as the 
writer's profession warrants and his title indicates. 
Sincerity of faith and loftiness of aspiration mark 
these religious pieces, which also have now and then 
a touch of mysticism. We may quote the Emer- 
sonian stanzas entitled - God in All ": 

" The flowing soul, nor low nor high, 

Is perfect here, is perfect there. 
Each drop in ocean orbs the sky, 

And seeing eyes make all things fair. 

" The evening cloud, the wayside flower 

Surpass the Andes and the rose; 
And wrapped in every hasty hour 
Is all the lengthened year bestows. 

' Therefore erase thy false degrees, 

From stock and stone strike starry fire. 
Lo ! even in the least of these 

Dwells the Lord Christ, the world's desire." 

Mr. Lloyd Mifflin's " Flower and Thorn " gives 
us an even fifty of his later sonnets, chaste, medi- 
tative, and inspired by the passion of varied ideal- 
isms. " The Lover's Retrospect " is one of the 
simplest and best in the collection : 

" In deeps of Elis, when was done the chase, 
Or ere she bathed, fair Arethusa stood 
Star-like in beauty. In that solitude 
Her loveliness lit all the leafy place. 
Alpheus, seeing the soul-light of that face, 
Loved her, although she did his arms elude ; 
At last beyond the blue Sicilian flood, 
They rushed together in one long embrace : 

' Light of my Youth ! in days of adverse fate 
I saw yon standing by my life's lone shore 
And passionately sought to clasp your hand ; 
But ah, than he I am less fortunate, 
Favored Alpheus! no Orfygian strand 
Shall see our currents mingle, ever more ! " 

Form and substance are here welded into almost 
perfect union, and both are of the purest essence of 
poetry. 

Mr. Howe's volume of " Harmonies " gives us 
graceful and cultured verse, of which the titular 
piece may be taken as fairly representative: 

" Strange instrument of many strings 
For men to play on, slaves and kings, 
Let me but keep thee, Life, in tune, 
That fall what may, by night or noon. 
Still in the heart shall sing for me 
One clear and constant melody. 



" Too oft the clamor and the .> 
Of living quench the notes of life ; 
Too oft they lose their customed way, 
In alien sequences to stray. 
Yet ever stealing back, they fall 
Into the cadence sought through all. 

" Then grief and gladness, love and pain 
Blend all their harmonies again ; 
The heavens uplift a shining arch 
Spacious above the soul's brave march : 
If I but keep thee, night and noon, 
Ever and truly, Life, in tune 
Strange instrument of many string* 
Fortlavet to play on, and for kinqt." 

It is not a deeper note but possibly a more solemn 
one, that is sounded in "The Field of Honor," 
with its fine ethical thought: 

" Soldier and statesman fall no more 

Like Hamilton, slain in his pride ; 
No sailor hero seeks the shore 

To die as great Decatnr died ; 
For honor's code of murderous lust 
Lies buried 'neath dishonor's dust. 

"Now in the dark east waits the day 

Long prophesied, prayed, yearned for still. 
When angered nations shall obey 

God's law for men thon shalt not kill. 
Then all the codes of blood shall cease, 
And fields of honor smile with peace." 

We take the poem called " Gloria Victis " as our 
illustration of Mr. Stafford's Dorian Days ": 

" Let the song cease and him who sang depart, 

Singer and song have found enough of praise ; 
The tale was all for one and touched her heart ; 
He only sang to one and won her bays. 

" Bear the dead knight in triumph though o'erthrown; 

The herald, who proclaims him conquered, lies; 
He jousted for his queen's delight alone, 

And she looked on him with acclaiming eyes. 

Let the pale martyr bleed ; he but obeyed 

The unrelenting conscience's behest. 
Of her, not of the world, he walked afraid, 
And when he gave her all she gave him rest." 

The greater part of Mr. Stafford's volume, as its 
title indicates, is made up of pieces upon classical 
themes. The author's blank verse is grave and 
restrained, almost Landorian in its simplicity and 
suggested strength. 

A pleasant conceit is expressed in " The Sea- 
flowers," one of the " New Poems " of Mr. Richard 
Edwin Day : 

" The living splendors of the main, 

The pink and purple companies. 
That spangle the untravelled plain, 
Beneath the azure seas, 

" Grow ever to an alien bloom, 

And sow the deep with buds and leaves 
Blossoms that light the cold, vast gloom 
O'er which the billow heaves. 

" But vacant is each silent court, 

And desolate each flowery way ; 
For in these paths no children sport, 
Nor whispering lovers stray. 

" No breeze of morning bends the stalks, 

No evening /fj>liyr lifts ilu- boughs 
That tremble only when these walks 
Slowly the dead ship plows.

Mr. Day turns for many of his themes to the 
romantic and legendary past to the Greeks, the 
Norsemen, and the Moors. He has, particularly, a 
group of longish poems in swinging anapaestic 
triplets that are of highly imaginative quality. His 
sonnets also are admirable, and include a notable 
sequence paying tribute to Dante.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



Kichard Hoffman, the New York

the good fortune to unite rare musi- 
cal gifts with a healthy and normal personality. 
Messrs. Scribner's Sons have recently published a 
very attractive little volume called " Some Musical 
Recollections of Fifty Years," containing a biog- 
raphical sketch by the deceased pianist's wife, his 
own " Recollections," and a reprint of his essay 
entitled " How to Stimulate Thought and Imagina- 
tion in a Pupil," published first in 1895 by D. 
Appleton & Co. An Englishman by birth, Hoffman 
came to this country in childhood, but his admira- 
tion for Queen Victoria was so great that he never 
renounced his allegiance to her. Established in 
New York as a teacher, composer, and concert per- 
former, in 1852. he never changed his residence 
and rarely visited other countries or even other 
parts of this country; but the mountain came to 
Mahomet, and he seems to have been in close per- 
sonal contact with a great number of the last gen- 
eration's musical celebrities, as well as with an 
interesting list of the distinguished in other fields. 
He is very happy in catching the curious traits of 
the great men and women of whose work he gives 
us glimpses. Mendelssohn laying aside his baton 
and applauding with the audience ; Leopold de 
Meyer being measured by his tailor while he gave a 
piano lesson ; Giulio Regondi interesting the serious 
musical public with performances on the concertina; 
Hoffman and the "Boy Wonder" Joseph Burke 
trundling a rented piano on its castors along the 
street to the owner's house after one of their con- 
certs; Sigismund Thalberg practising two bars of 
one of his own compositions all night long; Gotts- 
chalk biting his nails till he was unable to execute 
a glissando movement; these and a hundred other 



eccentric touches make the book a very engaging 
one. While not in any sense a sensational or "trick" 
performer, Hoffman himself will be remembered 
for his amazing quickness at sight-reading, which 
made it possible for him on several occasions to 
take the place of another performer on a moment's 
notice and play the most difficult music with accur- 
racy and expression. His memoirs are strewn with 
very positive general statements, which should set 
students of musical problems to thinking. He is sure 
that too much attention is being paid nowadays to 
technique, and too little to the expression of feeling. 
He tells us that the players of the last generation 
were more finished performers, because they did 
not scatter their studies over so great a variety of 
material. He considers the English chorus singers 
the best in the world, and his general estimate of 
musical England is very different from the current 
one. He is an optimist with regard to the musical 
future of America, from which country he predicts 
that "the great composers of the twentieth cen- 
tury " will come. 

The Elizabethan Mr - Bernard Shaw somewhere says 
dramatists on that he would willingly sacrifice one 
their own work. of Shakespeare's plays (which one, 
if we remember correctly, he does not specify) for 
the sake of a preface, written, we should presume 
as a necessary qualification, with the usual brilliance 
of G. B S. Shakespeare never wrote a preface, but 
he did drop a few casual remarks about the art of 
the drama ; these, along with those of his contem- 
poraries in the Elizabethan drama, Dr. David Klein 
has brought together into a volume entitled "Lit- 
erary Criticism from the Elizabethan Dramatists " 
(Sturgis and Walton Co.). The work considers 
first the criticism up to 1600, then that of Shake- 
speare and of Jonson, who had more to say about 
their art than practically all the others and on that 
account are given separate treatment, and finally that 
from 1600 to the closing of the theatres. Shake- 
speare stands forth as the romantic critic, Jonson 
as the classical ; the former conceived the theory of 
the contemporary drama, the latter founded the 
school which culminated in the eighteenth century. 
One emphasized " the inspirational aspect of poetic 
creation," the other declared that not inspiration 
but diligent labor produces poetry. The function 
of the drama develops from the purely moral pur- 
pose to that of profit and delight as in themselves 
sufficient. Authority is cast aside as the drama 
becomes aware of its own strength ; and here the 
dramatists are at entire variance with the profes- 
sional critics, who echoed the continental criticism, 
which was only a scholastic elaboration of Aris- 
totle's " Poetics." They realized too, even Jonson 
admits this in two places, though it is not his usual 
belief, that the people are the ultimate judge of 
the worth of a play. Jonson set his fellows thinking 
about the question of plot, and they bettered the 
instruction in that they saw its importance, though 
they differed as to what constituted a good plot,

THE DIAL

whether it should be simple or complicated. Jonson, 
unlike Shakespeare in the main, was opposed to the 
classical unity of action, but he held to the others ; 
thus he is reversed in modern theory. The literary 
quality of the drama was a matter of importance in 
that day, and the modern drama shows signs of a 
return to that belief, notwithstanding Dr. Klein's 
statement that the playwright to-day disregards or 
despises that quality. Out of the criticism of the 
dramatists came two profound truths: ''first, that 
freedom is essential to art ; second, that the imagi- 
nation is supreme in the sphere of art." In the 
words of Professor Spingarn, who furnishes a short 
Introductory Note, ' Dr. Klein deserves the thanks 
of scholars for having made this material accessible 
in a single volume." As to why he should have such 
spellings as " Aischylos," " Lily," and " Marlow," 
we must confess our ignorance, unless it be that 
the first is a reversion to type, and the others have 
become "reformed." 

A narrative o/ Eberhard Ludwig, Duke of Wttrtr 
love ami intrigue temberg in the early part of the 
in wurttemberff. eighteenth century, lived for twenty 
years in subservience to his capable and unscrupu- 
lous mistress, Wilhelmine von Gravenitz, a Meck- 
lenburg adventuress. This woman's life is told 
by Marie Hay in a volume entitled " A German 
Pompadour " (Scribner). Marie Hay has a certain 
skill in fleshing out historical episodes into sensat- 
ional half-romances, and her book has had its popu- 
larity. It was originally published in 1906, was 
reprinted the same year, and the present edition is 
the third one. There is a superabundance of cheap 
poetizing, and a cynical treatment of scandalous 
incidents which is not pleasing ; but the story itself 
is an exciting one, and is told with spirit. There 
is no documentation, and the curious reader is tor- 
mented to know how much of the unique complica- 
tion is history and how much is romance. He is 
the more at a loss because the work is so nearly 
sui generit. It is too rich in detail and psychol- 
ogizing to be a faithful recounting of the events of 
two centuries ago; it sacrifices dramatic effect to the 
known facts of history too often for romance, even 
the harnessed and hobbled romance of Muhlbach 
and Musick. It is a literary nondescript. Wilhel- 
mine's career is a romantic one. Summoned in 
1705 to Stuttgart from Gttstrow in Mecklenburg by 
her ambitious brother, who held a place at Court, 
Wilhelmine seems at once to have attracted the 
young Duke's favorable attention by her command- 
ing beauty and her marvellous singing voice, and 
to have easily displaced the favorite of the hour. 
Madame de Gevling. Through the new-comer's 
influence, a palace was built at Ludwigsburg, and 
the Court composed largely of her relatives and 
accomplices was transferred thither, leaving the 
Duchess Johanna Elizabetha and her sickly son to 
pine away in neglect at Stuttgart. The Duke sur- 
rendered his authority, and Wttrttemberg was man- 
aged, even to the pettiest details of government, 



by a low-born foreign woman without legal status . 
Eberhard Ludwig and his sweetheart were even 
parties to a marriage ceremony, which was promptly 
declared null and void by the Emperor. The reac- 
tion came; the favorite was deposed, exiled, recalls I. 
tried for various offenses, convicted, sentenced to 
life imprisonment, and, outliving the Duke and the 
Duke's line, pardoned at last, dying on a visit to a 
half-deserted village which was once her brilliant 
capital of Ludwigsberg. 



Recollection, Life OD the Plain8 and *' 

of Armv Hff Fort Phil Kearney Massacre, with 
on the plain*. an Account of the Celebration of 
'Wyoming Opened'" (Lippincott) is a realistic 
and stirring relation, forty years after, of the hard- 
ships and perils encountered by Mrs. Henry B. 
Carrington in her westward journey in 1866 to join 
her husband at a frontier military station in the 
then great Dakota Territory. After letting her 
manuscript lie and season for two years, Mrs. 
Carrington was moved to take it in hand again and 
add the narrative of her revisiting the old scenes 
on the occasion of the late celebration in honor of 
the victims of the Fort Kearney massacre. In that 
terrible slaughter she lost her first husband, Lieut. 
George W. Grummond, whose commanding officer, 
Colonel Carrington, she married five years later. 
The daily and hourly dangers from hostile Indians, 
and the winter sufferings from intense cold, with 
numerous other tests of her fortitude and endurance, 
are unrhetorically set forth in Mrs. Carrington's 
interesting narrative, which is accompanied by illus- 
trations and maps. In reviewing the changes that 
forty years have wrought in our great West, she 
refers to the coming of the railroad, to her own 
experience as " the only woman passenger on the 
first passenger train that went over the newly-laid 
track, nearly a hundred miles west from Omaha," 
and adds that now, instead of one road, we have 
three transcontinental lines. Railway progress has 
been even greater than that, as the latest maps 
indicate. The book is valuable as an eye-witness's 
account of memorable conditions that have long ago 
ceased to exist. _ 

Psychotherapy is in the air, and the 
world is more or less influenced by 
hygienic*. jhe widespread preaching of the 

gospel of spiritual hygienics. It is not amazing, 
therefore, that two simultaneous versions of Feuch- 
tersleben's Zur Duitetik der Seek should appear 
at this time ; and, fortunately for their translators 
and their publishers, neither need stand very much 
in the way of the other. Mr. Ludwig Lewisohn's 
translation, entitled " Health and Suggestion " 
(Huebsch) is in substance a faithful rendering 
of the original, briefly prefaced by the translator : 
while Mr. Gustav Pollak's book, " The Hygiene of 
the Soul " (Dodd) presents the Austrian physician's 
views on the subject in a very free adaptation, with 
much comment and related matter interspersed, and

with a prefatory account of Feuchtersleben's life 
and work. In fact, Mr. Pollak's sub-title, "The 
Memoir of a Physician and Philosopher," well 
indicates the nature of his book. Ernst Baron 
von Feuchtersleben was born in Vienna in 1806, 
and died there in 1849. His authorship of the 
popular German song beginning, Es ist bestimmt 
in Gottes Rath, besides other verse and prose, 
makes him interesting in a literary way ; but his 
best-known work is that of which we are now speak- 
ing, which appeared in 1838, and has now forty-six 
German editions to its credit. An English version 
appeared in London in 1852, as Mr. Pollak tells 
us, and this was reprinted in America in 1858, and 
again republished in a revised form in England in 
1873. Some aphorisms culled from Feuchtersleben's 
" Leaves from a Diary " are added to the original 
work, and a number of these have been reproduced 
by both Mr. Pollak and Mr. Lewisohn. The speci- 
mens given seem hardly to justify Mr. Pollak's 
opinion of the author as ranking "with the great 
writers of all countries in this branch of literature." 
As a psychotherapist, however, he is esteemed by 
Dr. Elwood Worcester and others of the school. 



. ful There is much useful material, not 

Shakespeare only for the teacher but also for the 
drill-book. general reader of studious bent, in 

Professor Albert H. Tolman's " Questions on Shake- 
speare " (University of Chicago Press), of which 
the first two volumes have just appeared. The First 
Part, which is introductory, consists of a compact 
exposition of Shakespeare's language and verse, and 
a select and valuable bibliography arranged under 
fifteen topics. We cannot agree with Professor 
Tolman that the metrical stress should be identical 
practically with the grammatical or sense stress, that, 
for instance, "That her | wi'de waMs | encom | 
pass'd but | on'e m'an " should have both syl- 
lables stressed in the second and the fifth feet, and 
that neither should be stressed in the first and the 
fourth. So read, it becomes prose, not verse. Even 
in prose, the " but " bears a stress. The Second 
Part is a drilling in questions of a general nature, 
then on individual acts and scenes, characters, 
sources, and text. In this part our author takes up 
the first histories the three parts of "Henry VI.," 
and " Richard III." the early poems, and the first 
comedies "Love's Labour's Lost," "The Comedy 
of Errors," " The Two Gentlemen of Verona," and 
" A Midsummer-Night's Dream." The questions 
are such as will demand a lot of thinking and con- 
siderable reading in order to arrive at satisfactory 
answers. 

The cobbler- Mr ' Wiuiam Leighton has trans- 
poet of the lated some forty-five of Hans Sachs's 

Reformation. "Merry Tales " and three " Shrove- 
tide Plays " (David Nutt) into trotting Hudibrastic 
verse, and has prefaced them with a brief " Fore- 
word " on the life and work of the author. This 
translation gives the English reader a very good 
idea of the mild satire of the cobbler-poet of the 



Reformation, for these poems are mainly satirical 
of common conditions at that time ; he pokes fun at 
the guilelessness of the peasant, the clever rascality 
of the impecunious student, the greed and laziness 
of the religious orders, the sorrows of the jealous 
husband, the iniquities of the cheating landlord. 
All this is done without the bitterness of his contem- 
porary Protestant reformers, more after the fashion 
of a rustic Chaucer who disapproves of the present 
shocking state of affairs but whose sense of humor 
forces him to smile at it. The frontispiece to this 
volume is a good reproduction of a fine portrait of 
old Hans from a seventeenth century wood-cut. 

Indian leaenas Much f the S\ am r that ^rounds 
of the great the red man or the western wilder- 
Northwest. ness j s doubtless due to the freedom, 
real or imagined, of his forest life, and to the 
sublimities of nature amid which he moved. Some- 
thing of the unfading glory of that life in the open, 
under the spell of majestic mountains, mirror-like 
lakes, pathless forests, and boundless prairies, has 
been caught and preserved for us in the pages of 
Miss Helen Fitzgerald Sanders's "Trails through 
Western Woods," published by the Alice Harriman 
Co. of Seattle. Many quaint legends and well- 
executed descriptive sketches are to be found in its 
pages. In at least one instance, we are told, native 
tradition never before published is presented on the 
authority of an Indian narrator, as translated by an 
experienced interpreter. Like all folk-lore, it is 
crude, simple, childish, and of small value or inter- 
est in itself; but it helps one to conceive of the 
vanishing Indian as he really was. In a vein of 
retrospective regret the author says: "Lafcadio 
Hearn expressed pity for the cast-off Shinto gods 
whose places were usurped by the deities of the Bud- 
dhist creed. Likewise, the best Christian amongst 
us, if he looks beneath the surface into the heart of 
things, must be conscious of a vague regret for the 
quaint, mythical lore which cast its glamour over 
the wilderness ; for the poor, vanished phantoms of 
the wood and the gods who have fallen from their 
thrones. Sometimes in the remotest mountain soli- 
tudes we dare to acknowledge thoughts we would 
not harbour elsewhere."

Morton Payne's "Leading American Essayists,"

The Introduction treats briefly of lesser essayists 
born before the middle of the last century. Some 
important writers are left for other volumes in the 
series; Lowell and Holmes, who are essayists as 
well as poets, are to be treated under the latter 
class. It is questionable whether such arbitrary 
classification of literary biographies is satisfactory. 
There is certain to be considerable overlapping of 
writers from one class to another, and not infre- 
quently the work in each class may be of the first

importance. In the individual biographies one can- 
not regard only the work done l>y the author as poet 
or as essayist or as novelist ; the full work of the man 
must be brought out in the outline of his life and his 
literary development. If, again, one wishes to study 
any one genre, such aa the essay, one must hunt 
through the series to get at all the essayists and to 
know their work. The biographies in the volume 
before us are well done. They are no mere compila- 
tions of facts from the lives of the subjects, but suc- 
cinct and readable accounts of the development of 
these men as literary forces in the great era of Ameri- 
can letters. As far as possible, the men themselves or 
their contemporaries are made their own interpreters. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 

In a volume entitled "The Health of the City" 
(Houghton) Mr. H oil is Godfrey has written ten chap- 
ters on the best way to secure health for the residents 
of cities. He writes out of full knowledge, and in an 
interesting style, of such matters as air, milk, food, 
water, ice, plumbing, noise, housing, etc. A carefully 
selected bibliography is added. 

M Euthenics, the Science of Controllable Environ- 
ment," by Ellen H. Richards, is a timely book issued 
by Whitcomb & Barrows, Boston. Nine-tenths of the 
questions which absorb the energies of most legislators 
are petty compared with those discussed by the talented 
New England woman who does so much to make the 
fundamental physical sciences serve higher human effici- 
ency. In a wasteful age and land, this message is needed. 
The table of activities and methods found at the end 
of the volume is an admirable summary of the argu- 
ment and a definite programme for community action. 

A second edition of Mr. K. H. Lock's "Recent 
Progress in the Study of Variation, Heredity, and Evo- 
lution" (Duttou) has recently been issued. It is sub- 
stantially a reprint of the first edition, the only change 
of particular moment being the addition of a chaper on 
Eugenics. Minor additions and revisions have brought 
the other chapters into accord with the developments 
which have occurred in the subjects treated during the 
period from 1906 to 1910. There is no apparent reason 
why this second edition should not succeed to the 
popularity achieved by the first as a clear and non- 
technical exposition of the general significance of the 
results of investigations made during the last decade in 
the field of evolution. 

In Mr. Harold Waldstein Foght's "American Rural 
School" (Macmillan), we have a systematic and well- 
rounded discussion of the essential aims and principles 
of the hosts of teachers who are trying to better condi- 
tions in the country school. Mr. Foght has done his 
work thoroughly well ; he knows the facts and is capa- 
ble of interpreting them from the standpoint of a pro- 
fessional teacher. He gives in one volume a summary 
of the discussions by competent leaden on the subjects 
of organization, administration, maintenance, supervis- 
ion, training, salaries of teachers, sanitation, (esthetic 
problems, gardens, clubs, manual training, libraries, 
hygiene, and consolidation. The recommendations are 
wise, timely, and practical, tke style spirited and clear; 
but the bibliography, although good as far as it goes, 
might well have been made more complete. 



NOTES. 



A new volume of Dr. Samuel M. Crothers's essays 
is a welcome announcement of the Fall season. Mr. 
Howells will also have a new volume. 

Mr. Herbert N. Casson, who not long ago gave us 
" The Romance of the Reaper," has now prepared for 
early publication " The Romance of the Telephone." 

Probably the most interesting drama of the Fall 
publishing season will be M. Maeterlinck's "M:u\ 
Magdalene," a play founded on the familiar 15il.lic.il 
theme. 

" The Book of Ruth " is soon to be brought out in an 
attractive illustrated edition by the Dodge Publishing 
Co., with an introduction by Bishop William A. Quayle 
of Oklahoma. 

Mr. Randall Parrish will have two new books to his 
credit this Fall. One of these, " Keith of the Border," 
is a tale of the Western plains; the other is a story for 
boys entitled " Don MacGrath." 

Mr. Robert Hichens's articles on the Holy Land, 
which with Jules Gue"rin's splendid illustrations in color 
have been appearing in the "Century Magazine," will 
be issued shortly as a holiday gift-book. 

An attractive " Portrait Catalogue " of the publica- 
tions of the Baker & Taylor Co. has recently appeared. 
We are reminded in its pages that this house is one of 
the oldest in the American trade, its existence dating 
back to 1830. 

The " Memories and Impressions " of Madame 
Helena Modjeska, comprising an autobiography of the 
great Polish- American actress, promises to be one of 
the most interesting biographical works of the coming 
season. 

The forthcoming novel by Mr. J. C. Snaith, entitled 
" Mrs. Fitz," is said to combine the setting and atmos- 
phere of modern English country life with the spirit of 
romance and adventure associated with the Zenda type 
of fiction. 

September 13 has been fixed upon as the publication 
date of Mr. William de Morgan's new novel "An 
Affair of Dishonor." While shorter than this author's 
previous books, the new story is said to be twice as long 
as the average novel. 

The eighteenth edition of Winwood Reade's study of 
civilization entitled "The Martyrdom of Man," with 
an introduction by Mr. F. Legge, is published by the 
John Lane Company. The recurring reprints of this 
work attest to its permanent value. 

The recent death of Dr. William J. Rolfe will bring 
to a close the revision of his edition of Shakespeare's 
plays, which was going forward, and which the Baker 
& Taylor Co. are issuing in a special limp leather edi- 
tion. The volumes hereafter to be issued in this form 
will contain all of Dr. Rolfe 's notes in unabridged form. 

At least three new books by Mr. E. V. Lucas will 
enliven the coming season. Chief among these is " Mr. 
Ingleside," a long novel of modern English life. The 
two others are " The Slowcoach," a book for children ; 
and " The Second Post," an anthology of letters on the 
same plan as " The Gentlest Art." 

Mr. G. K. Chesterton is said to have entered upon 
a new literary field in a series of detective stories. 
Strange to say, his hero is not a Sherlock Homes or a 
Leooq, but a gentle little parish priest who uses his 
knowledge of human nature gained in his religious work 



1910.]

to unravel mysterious crimes which have baffled the 
police. These stories, which are to be first published 
in serial form, are to begin with one entitled " The 
Innocence of Father Brown." 

" The New Machiavelli " is the title chosen by Mr. 
H. G. Wells for his new novel, now in press. It is said 
to be more similar in style to " Touo-Bungay " than to 
" Ann Veronica " or " Mr. Polly," and it was composed, 
after the author's fashion, in the intervals of writing 
the other two. 

In the early Fall, Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. will 
bring out a noteworthy illustrated edition of Cooper's 
"The Last of the Mohicans," for which Mr. E. Boyd 
Smith has made eight colored illustrations, and numer- 
ous outline chapter-heads, on somewhat the same plan 
as those of his illustrated edition of " Robinson Crusoe," 
published last year. 

Hitherto there has been no trustworthy account, in 
available form, of the woman's suffrage movement, 
which has lately made such tremendous headway. This 
lack is soon to be supplied in the publication of two 
important books, " The Suffragette," by Miss E. Sylvia 
Pankhurst, a daughter of the famous English leader; 
and " What Eight Million Women Want," prepared 
with more particular reference to the movement in this 
country by Mrs. Rheta Childe Dow. 

Those who have already been startled by some chance 
discovery of the debasing and deadly conditions of 
residence in our cities ask for a definite, practical, and 
authoritative plan of improvement. An attempt to 
meet this need is made by Mr. Lawrence Veiller in a 
timely work on " Housing Reform." Mr. Veiller is one 
of the best informed men in the world on this particular 
subject; he is master of all the technical problems in- 
volved; he has a constructive policy; and he knows how 
to state his points clearly and forcibly. He has been 
criticized for his conservative attitude toward municipal 
ownership of tenement property; but no one can deny 
that he bases his objections on past experience. His 
suggestions for legislative and municipal regulation 
are wise and radical in the best sense. 

A " Modern Criminal Science Series " of books writ- 
ten by continental authorities is an important enterprise 
announced by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. It appears 
that the American Institute of Criminal Law and Crimin- 
ology is behind the enterprise, for this organization is 
of the opinion that America is backward in intelligent 
and systematic improvement of the criminal law. It 
was decided therefore to translate and publish, with 
American introductions, the principal works dealing 
with the individualization of present treatment and the 
causes of crime that now hold the stage of thought 
on the Continent. The first book to appear will be 
" Criminal Psychology," by Professor Hans Gross of 
Austria, translated by Dr. Horace M. Kallen, lecturer 
in philosophy at Harvard; the author will supply a 
special preface for American readers, and Professor 
Joseph Jastrow of the University of Wisconsin will fur- 
nish an introduction. This work will be followed later 
in the season by " Modern Theories of Criminality," by 
C. Bernaldo de Quiros of Madrid; the translator is Dr. 
Alphonse de Salvio of Northwestern University, and 
an American preface to accompany the translation has 
been prepared by the author, while Dr. W. W. Smithers 
of Philadelphia will supply an introduction. Other vol- 
umes to follow in 1911 include "Crime, Its Causes and 
Remedies," by Cesare Lombroso; "Criminal Sociology," 
by Enrico Ferri, Professor of Criminal Law and Pro- 



cedure in the University of Rome; "The Individualiza- 
tion of Punishment," by Raymond Saleilles, Professor 
of Comparative Law in the University of Paris; "Penal 
Philosophy," by Gabriel Tarde, late Magistrate in 
Picardy, France; "Criminality and Economic Condi- 
tions," by W. A. Bouger, Doctor in Law of the Uni- 
versity of Amsterdam ; " Criminology," by Raffaelle 
Garofalo, late President of the Court of Appeals of 
Naples; and " Crime and Its Repression," by Gustar 
Aschaffenburg of Cologne.

The One Indispensable 

Medium for Publishers 

of Worthy Books 

"T'HIRTY years of continuous publi- 
cation under the same management 
speak for THE DIAL'S stability and 
success. It is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the inter- 
ests of the book class, the literary 
and cultivated class, the class that buy 
books. It is issued from the second 
largest city in the country, the centre 
of the immense book-consuming region 
of the Middle West. 



'"FHE DIAL is more generally con- 
sulted and depended upon by 
librarians in making up orders for 
books than any other American critical 
journal; it circulates more widely 
among retail booksellers than any 
other journal of its class; it is the 
accustomed literary guide and aid of 
thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country. 



HTHESE facts make THE DIAL indis- 
putably the foremost medium for 
high-grade advertising, the one 
indispensable medium for the publisher 
of worthy books.

UNINTERESTING SOUVENIR OF 
FAMOUS LITERARY MEN 



NEITHER DORKING NOR 
THE ABBEY u y j. M. BARRIE 

OF the many tributes to George Meredith 
called forth by his death last May, prob- 
ably the most appropriate and beautiful was that 
contributed by Mr. J. M. Barrie to "The West- 
minster Gazette" of London, under the title 
"Neither Dorking nor the Abbey." That this 
brilliant little essay may not be lost to the many 
who love both Meredith and Barrie, we have 
issued it in attractive booklet form, printed on 
handmade paper and silk-stitched in blue hand- 
made paper wrappers with printed title -label. 
There is a brief prefatory note, and appended are 
Thomas Hardy's fine verses on the death of Mere- 
dith. As the edition is limited, orders should be 
sent at once. Price, 50 cents, postpaid.

ENCHANTED GROUND 

An Episode in the Life of a Young Man 
By HARRY JAMES SMITH 

" A real ' find ' by a publisher's reader is an event so rare, as has been said by one of our 
genial literary essayists perhaps Curtis or Howells, or someone who knew whereof he 
spoke, that when the patient literary purveyor discovers such a treasure among the reams of 
uncompellatory manuscripts through which he plods his weary way, he is so elated that he 
goes about clapping his friends on the shoulder and inviting them to take a drink with him 
in celebration of his luck. Some such spiritual exhilaration would have been pardonable, 
we fancy, to the reader for Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Company when the manuscript of 
'Enchanted Ground' swam into his ken. The joyous event must have diffused an atmosphere 
of cheer through the sedate establishment on Park Street, and brought prosperity to the more 
hilarious centres of culture variously located on Tremont Street and Beacon Hill. And now 
the book is issued, and the public becomes sharers in the joy, not necessarily to celebrate its 
advent with libations, but to delight in it and go about telling their story-loving friends how 
good it \s."The Dial. 

" We suspect that this story will prove, if not a 'best ' seller, a very good one. , It has a 
strong vein of sentiment, a flexible and kindly humor, a plot directly concerned with a pair of 
young lovers, and a vigorous style." The Nation. 

" As an observer of cosmopolitan life, Mr. Smith is obviously an adept, and he repro- 
duces what he has seen and heard with a keen sense of its mingled comedy and tragedy." 
Boston Transcript. 

"An interesting and well-told story, which combines right thinking with good writing in 
a way that promises much for the author's future." Chicago Record-Herald.

An Important New Work of Interest to Scholars and Students 

WATSON 

ON THE 

CONSTITUTION 

By DAVID K. WATSON, LL.B., LL.D., of the Columbus, Ohio, Bar 

An exhaustive, well-balanced, comprehensive treatise, tracing the outlines of the Constitution from tin- meeting 
of the first Colonial Congress in 1774 to the convention which framed the Constitution in 1787. A complete 
history is given of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence ; of the correspondence of Jefferson, 
Adams, and other statesmen and members of the Colonial Congress relating to that subject, together with 
sketches of the men who composed the Constitutional Convention. The history of the Constitution begins with 
the preamble, of which there is given the most complete history ever written. Each article is then considered 
in its order, section by section and clause by clause. This arrangement is followed throughout the work.

SOME FLASHES FROM 

As brilliant a series of reviews as was ever accorded 

AN AMERICAN NOVEL 



" My candidate for the next Nobel Peace Prize would 
be Will Levington Comfort's ardent anti-war novel, 




writes Edwin Markham in the New York American. 



APART FROM THE BOOK'S THRILLING HUMANITY, 
ROUTLEDGE RIDES ALONE IS 

A LOVE STORY of great beauty and power." Washington Star. 

" A GRIPPING STORY. The terrible intensity of the writer holds one chained to the 
book." Chicago Tribune. 

" A GALLOPING STORY. In the manner of its telling it is romance raised to a high 
power." New York Times. 

A DARING STORY which stands out boldly among the fiction of the day." Phila- 
delphia Press. * 

" A RED-BLOODED STORY with the all-compelling motive of the great love of man 
for woman and woman for man." Buffalo Express. 

" A FIGHTING STORY. A half score of Men and one dazzling diamond of a Woman 
stand in the picture, not beside it." Detroit Journal. 

"A NOTABLE STORY, largely planned and nobly executed; splendid in action; alive 
with feeling." New York American. 

A POWERFUL STORY. Comfort waited to master the biggest demand of the novel 
to-day. His love interest is first." Pittsburg Dispatch. 

" A DASHING STORY. A carnival of adventure, softened now and then by the presence 
of a lady." Leslie's Weekly. 

"A REMARKABLE STORY. One of the biggest and finest romances that has been 
written these many years." Chicago Journal. 

"AN IMPRESSIVE STORY; in fact one of the best stories of its kind that we have 
ever read." The Dial, Chicago. 



" A BIG STORY that fairly overwhelms the reader " is a part of the Kansas City Star's enthusiasm. 
The Albany Times-Union adds distinction with: "A STORY OF REAL GENIUS," and the Twentieth 
Century Magazine expresses the current approval thus: " One of the best works of fiction that has appeared 
in months." 

A late addition to one of the greatest series of critiques ever accorded an American novel is from the 
Chicago Inter- Ocean's column and a half: "There's in fiction not a woman more truly lovable than the 
one woman of this book, Noreen. . . . From start to finish ROUTLEDGE RIDES INDEED; creeps, 
lags, or stumbles never once, good folk!"

The great event of the coining publishing season in 
England. The oldest institution of learning in the 
world. Of interest to Shakespeare lovers. San 
Francisco's seventy libraries. A railroad test of the 
popularity of the classics. Two curious reasons 
for the English liking of American novels. Inter- 
bibliothecal rivalry. A Mark Twain monument in 
Heidelberg. Publicity for public libraries. Pecu- 
niary encouragement for literary talent. What 
books beside novels the masses read.

TWO RECENT AMERICAN CLASSICS. 

It is the business of the literary critic to 
fight for the chiefs who have fallen on the field 
of letters, to drag their bodies from the heap of 
the slain, to build their pyre and see that they 
have due funeral honors. Or if this is too 
heroic a strain, the critic may be compared to 
Scott's " Old Mortality," who went about 
among the graveyards, freshening up the head- 
stones and recarving the names of the martyred 
dead. We do not do enough of this sort of thing 
in America, at least in our periodicals. "Out 
of sight, out of mind." What we do is to wait 
for anniversaries, when at one fell swoop we 
jumble together our impressions of our great 
men. During the intervals we allow their 
names to be obscured, their books to drop list- 
lessly from our hands. A continual modest 
service in the temple of fame would be better 
for their reputation. To change the figure, it 
is by the frequent assaying of the ore of litera- 
ture that we get at last its value and determine 
the intellectual riches of a nation. 

Stedman and Aldrich are two of our last 
inheritors of renown whose claims have not yet 
been adjudged, whose ghosts indeed have hardly 
yet come into that arena where the struggle for 
immortality is on. In their earlier life they 
were overshadowed by our older group of poets ; 
and they fell on evil days in the end, when the 
waters of oblivion seemed to rise and roll over 
everything that was distinguished, that had the 
stamp of poetry and pure art. Aldrich has been 
rescued from the engulfing tide by Mr. Greens- 
let in a biography which is a model of tact and 
taste. Stedman still awaits his memorial. 

Both these men were primarily poets. Like 
wine, poetry seems to require a certain time to 
ripen and mellow. What is minor poetry to 
contemporaries often comes of age and discloses 
quite adult qualities. Neither Aldrich nor 
Stedman, though popular in a way, was taken 
quite seriously when alive ; but they are good 
being gone. 

Both men, too, were essentially lyric poets. 
What they essayed in other fields of verse, nar- 
rative or dramatic, will hardly be counted in the 
canon of their work. As both were forced to 
depend mainly on prose writing or on editorial 
labors for a livelihood, their output in poetry is

not large. A comparison of the two may per- 
haps help to bring out the qualities that each 



In lyric poetry, there are three prime fac- 
tors the movement or lilt of the verse, the 
richness and pregnancy of the words, and the 
originality and importance of the theme. Of 
these, the first is overwhelmingly the most 
important. Lyrical poetry is song, and its 
winged rush of sound is what carries it to the 
heart and head. The poorest words, the most 
meagre thoughts, will live if they are associated 
with some gush of lyric verse, some thrilling or 
unexpected movement of metre which the senses 
find memorable. Mother Goose's melodies hold 
their place. In narrative poetry the second 
quality that of loveliness or majesty of dic- 
tion is predominant ; and in dramatic work it 
is the theme, evolved through character, which 
is all-important. Of course, in a perfect work 
of poetry, long or short, all these elements 
ought to combine and form a final flower of 
art. And of course they are seldom distinctly 
separable. We cannot put our finger here or 
here, and say that this is music, and this is 
expression, and this is theme. Poems are not 
made like a pound-cake a cupful of this, a 
cupful of that, and a pinch of the other. But 
we can usually recognize the predominant char- 
acteristic of a poem and discern the principal 
gift of the poet. 

Stedman, both by nature and conviction, 
was a singer. He carried his belief in the song- 
element of poetry into his criticism, frequently 
to the injury of his critical poise. This belief 
accounts for his preferring Hood to Arnold, 
for his adoration of Swinburne, for his over- 
estimate of Lanier. All the poems which bear 
the stamp of his right genius have a spontaneity, 
a heartiness as if they were written by the blood 
itself, in their metre and movement. Some- 
times this spontaneity is perhaps rather cheap, 
as in "The Diamond Wedding." Sometimes, 
as in " Bohemia," " The Ballad of Lager Bier," 
or " How Old Brown Took Harper's Ferry," 
it is reminiscent of Tennyson or Thackeray or 
Lowell. But in a considerable group of his 
poems, such as " Country Sleighing," " An- 
onyma," and " Pan in Wall Street," his music 
is his own, is a new thing. 

Aldrich's melodies are more of the mind, 
echoes from haunted chambers of the brain. 
He has little spontaneity, though in some of his 
early pieces the ballad of " Baby Bell " and 
44 When the Sultan Goes to Ispahan " there 



is the same throb, the same clear and open note, 
as in Stedman. But his characteristic music 
is secret and unexpected, ethereal incantations. 
All his lyrics are poems, they are not songs. 
And, indeed, even Stedman, with his far more 
obvious and easy lilt, never wrote a piece which 
any considerable number of people would want 
to sing. 

In the great quality of expression, in preg- 
nancy, pomp, or perfection of words, neither 
poet had a great deal to boast of. Without 
doing them the disfavor of bringing against 
them the large utterance of our early poetic 
gods, it may be said that there is a secondary 
American poet, with whom they had much in 
common, who may be called upon to test them. 
It may be doubted if there is anything in Sted- 
man or Aldrich which for concentration of style 
or loveliness of diction equals the best work of 
Fitz-Greene Halleck the starred, flushed, 
faceted passages of " Alnwick Castle," " Boz- 
zaris," or the poem to Burns. 

" Wild roses by the Abbey towers 

Are gay in their young bud and bloom ; 

They were born of a race of funeral-flowers 

That garlanded, in long-gone hours, 
A templar's knightly tomb." 

No, our recent classics have not the classic cast 
and color of diction of poems like these. Even 
Dr. Holmes in the one passage where he stands 
tiptoe on the pinnacle of expression, surpasses 
them : 

" The mossy marbles rest 
On the lips that he has prest 
In their bloom." 

Aldrich has more of the wonder and glory 
of words than Stedman, but his is a frail 
splendor at its best, like the cloud-wraiths 
after the sunset's fires have left them. Two of 
his sonnets, that on " Sleep " and the " Enam- 
ored Architect of Airy Rhyme," are the limitary 
outposts of his domain of words. Aldrich may 
be said to be the greatest master of the theme 
among American lyrical poets. Given a mood, 
a fancy, a fragrant thought, and he presents it 
in its naked simplicity, so that it stamps itself 
on the reader's mind and haunts him with its 
significance. And there is a large group of his 
poems in which this thematic power is exhibited. 
Among them are " Identity," " Memory," u Pres- 
cience," "Untimely Thought," " Destiny," " Ap- 
paritions." In their kind they are almost unique. 
Odd as it may sound, he may have trained his 
gift for this piercing forthright kind of poem 
from his long handling of light verse. Vers d 
societe do not require pomp of phrase or sjx?cial

richness of music. They are better for having 
nothing to call away the attention from the neat 
setting forth of central idea or scene. Aldrich's 
"Palabras Carinosas" and "Thalia" are in 
their way as simple and direct as his poignant 
tragic studies. 

Some of Stedman's later poems show this 
same thematic effect. Both poets were influ- 
enced by the spirit of the age, which had, tem- 
porarily at least, turned away from the physical, 
male, aristocratic God of poetry, towards the 
spiritual, womanly, democratic Muse. In prose 
Stedman was the critic, and Aldrich the novelist 
and short-story writer. Some may think the 
functions should have been reversed. In view 
of Aldrich's letters, which have lately been pub- 
lished, it is impossible to doubt that his literary 
judgment was surer, his taste keener, than 
Stedman's. When they clashed in opinion, 
Aldrich was always right. And Stedman, 
in his narrative poems of " The Blameless 
Prince " and " Alice of Monmouth," gave evi- 
dence of creative gifts, the power over elemental 
human nature, superior to Aldrich's talents in 
this kind. If Stedman had written novels, his 
figures would have moved in heavier marching 
order than Aldrich's light skirmish-line. But 
Stedman took up the critic's burden, and gave 
us what is on the whole our largest body of 
sound literary appreciation. It is impossible 
to over-praise his devotion to the highest mani- 
festations of literary art. He compelled Amer- 
ica for awhile to attend to poetry, something 
which no one since has succeeded in doing. He 
had his quota of defects as a critic. He was 
too temperate in his eulogy of the best, and too 
tolerant in his treatment of the mediocre. He 
kept to the via media, which, though safe, is 
hardly the path of revelation. The great 
mass of his judgments are good, they will 
stand ; but the question is, whether posterity 
will care to refer to them. They are in the 
main contemporary judgments, and it is a great 
deal easier to be wise and pregnant and pene- 
trating about the literature of the past than 
about that which is rising around one. Every 
critic has his defects. Stedman's Waterloo was 
his judgment on Arnold, whose merits, either in 
prose or verse, he seemed incapable of seeing. 

Aldrich's prose works were so fresh, so 
sparkling, that judicious readers hailed them 
as a special dispensation, the art of France 
made decorous for American homes. Read over 
again now, a good deal of them seems thin ; the 
sparkle has somewhat evaporated. But they 



have by no means gone flat like stale champagne, 
and the scaling down of their pretensions is the 
fate to which nearly all fiction has to submit. 
The novel and the short-story seem almost as 
evanescent as the art of the theatre. 

Aldrich invented an art of the short-story of 
his own ; and it was an invention which needed 
no patent, for no one could infringe upon it 
without detection. Perhaps he used his trick 
of surprise too often. But his short stories are 
still readable, and are likely to keep their place 
with those of a half-dozen of our best recent 
artists. They certainly do not class with those 
of the older men Poe, Hawthorne, or Irving. 
Of his novelettes, " Prudence Palfrey " has a 
cool, virginal charm ; there has hardly been a 
better embodiment in prose of New England 
life. The opening pages of " The Queen of 
Sheba" promise a masterpiece, and though it 
falls off in the end it is still a delightful thing. 
" The Story of a Bad Boy " is unique in its 
charm and in its healthy humor. Mass and 
velocity, Aldrich did not have. And by mass 
we do not mean length. A great artist can 
make the carving of a cherry-stone colossal, as 
witness some of Shakespeare's and Milton's son- 
nets. But grace and pleasantness appeal, and 
Aldrich's prose has enough of these qualities 
to make it permanently enduring. 

We are told that we should not try to classify 
and rank masterpieces that we should not 
look gift-horses in the mouth. The game of 
precedence is an old one, however, and we 
probably shall have to keep it up. No one can 
foretell how Aldrich and Stedman will finally 
come to stand in our roll of writers ; but no 
one would now claim for them an equality with 
the elder gods of our literature with Poe, or 
Emerson, or Bryant. Nor have they the power 
and magnificence of that more mortal monarch, 
Lowell. The romance writers Irving, Haw- 
thorne, Cooper are larger figures. But they 
are likely to have no mean place among the 
rest, with Longfellow, so melodious and sooth- 
ing, yet so essentially unoriginal, so plumb to 
the average ; with Whittier, that Quaker volcano 
who instead of fire spouted half-fused stones 
and homely earth ; or with Whitman, with his 
amorphous verse and his doctrines borrowed 
from Emerson and the Hindus and badly 
understood. A little art of great excellence will 
hold its own with masses of inferior quality. 
Aldrich and Stedman have hardly had their 
just dues, either in life or as yet in death.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE GREAT EVENT OF THE COMING PUBLIMtlM. 

SEASON IN ENGLAND will be, according to the Lon- 
don " Nation," the issue of the eleventh edition of 
the Encyclopaedia Britannica," The time of the 
publication will be about the beginning of November, 
when, in contrast with the earlier method of pub- 
lishing one volume at a time, fourteen volumes of 
the twenty-eight will see the light, and will be fol- 
lowed in about three months' time by the remaining 
fourteen volumes, which include the Index. It 
may be said at once of this great venture, to which 
Mr. Hugh Chisholm and his able staff have devoted 
eight laborious years, that, first, it is essentially a 
new book in one volume, for example, not more 
than sixteen per cent of the old material has been 
used and, secondly, that it is authoritative through- 
out Its fifteen hundred contributors cover all the 
learned institutions of the world, and include a 
great body of practical workers and experts in their 
departments of thought and life. Many of these 
first-class authorities have written, not only the 
longer articles, but the brief notices which are 
usually assigned to less accomplished students. In 
a word, the new Encyclopaedia represents a thor- 
oughly fresh and complete work of specialization. 
The great novelty on the mechanical side of the 
venture is the issue on India paper, in a form in 
which a volume of over nine hundred pages can be 
read and even turned back on its cover with the 
greatest ease. A further advantage is cheapness ; 
each volume will be issued at a little more than 
half the price of its predecessor. The work, as a 
whole, is beyond doubt a very great feat of British 
scholarship and literary organization. 


THE OLDEST INSTITUTION OF LEARNING IN THE 

WORLD is probably the University of El Ashar, at 
Cairo, founded by the great Saladin in the year 
988, and occupying an ancient mosque in the Arab 
quarter of the city. Here, sitting at the foot of a 
column assigned him by the particular descendant 
of the Prophet who chances at the time to be Chan- 
cellor of the University, any reputable man of 
learning may gather around him such disciples as his 
fame or ability succeeds in attracting. Eight thou- 
sand five hundred and ten such learners are enrolled 
in the latest catalogue ; or, at least, Patterson's " Col- 
lege and School Directory" gives that as the number. 
One is almost sorry to read that recently a wealthy 
Egyptian, some Rockefeller of the Nile, has left a 
generous bequest for the erection of a new building, 
so that the rambling old mosque, a series of cloisters 
surrounding open courts and covering several acres 
of space, is likely to be deserted ere long, perhaps 
to be torn down. What a contrast to our smart 
groups of laboratories, museums, lecture-rooms, libra- 
ries, and dormitories, which constitute the visible 
and tangible parts of our universities, is this old 
Egyptian seminary of learning! Contemplating 
its millennium of educational activity, and learning 



further, from the above-named " Directory," that 
there are no fewer than thirty-six other univenuticN 
that were founded before the end of the fifteenth 
century, one loses something of one's pride in the 
antiquity of Harvard and Yale and Columbia. In 
educational history they are but toddling infants. 



OF INTEREST TO SHAKESPEARE LOVERS every- 
where is the project, recently formulated in the I Con- 
don " Times " over the signatures of seventeen prom- 
inent literary men, to acquire by public subscription 
" The Shakespeare Head Press " at Stratford-upon- 
Avon, and to make of it a permanent centre for the 
publication of Shakespearian literature. This Press, 
it will be recalled, was established in 1904 by Mr. 
A. H. Bullen (known to all who know Elizabethan 
literature), with the primary object of issuing from 
the poet's native town a worthy edition of his works. 
That edition, completed some time ago, stands as a 
monument of dignified bookmaking a worthy mod- 
ern successor of the noble old folios. Other publi- 
cations, of less importance but all distinctive in form 
and contents, have appeared from the Press at inter- 
vals ; and Mr. Bullen has now in preparation a vol- 
ume embodying Professor Wallace's full presentation 
of his recent sensational Shakespeare discoveries. 
The Press occupies the house in Stratford once 
leased by Julius Shaw, an intimate friend of Shake- 
speare and one of the witnesses to his will. Not 
the least of the perennial charms of Stratford to 
the literary pilgrim is a ramble through this quaint 
old Tudor house, with its timbered ceilings and 
massive chimney and lovely old-world garden ' cir- 
cummured with brick." It is peculiarly fitting that 
Mr. Bullen's pious labors should find habitation 
here; and we have no doubt that Shakespeare lovers 
in America will count it an honor to bear their part 
in the plan now in progress toward lifting all 
financial incubus from his shoulders and making 
the Press a permanent addition to Stratford's noble 
memorials of her poet 



SAN FRANCISCO'S SEVENTY LIBRARIES, as enu- 
merated and briefly described in the July number 
of " News Notes of California Libraries," betoken 
unusual and very creditable activity in this branch 
of public education. Already, only four years after 
the destructive earthquake and fire of 1906, the 
public library of the city has acquired respectable 
proportions, 98,499 being the reported number of 
volumes now in its possession, with a main building 
and three branches from which to circulate them. 
Among the seventy and more libraries and reading 
or reference rooms enumerated, we note the 
" Chinese Reading Society Reading Room. Wong

Chinese consul." But when will John Chinaman 
reach the point of using our American public libra- 
ries, together with his fellow-aliens from Germany 
and Sweden and Italy and other old-world countries? 
A pig-tail in a public library has such a sight ever 
been seen ? And will it ever be ? 

A RAILROAD TEST OF THE POPULARITY OF THE 

CLASSICS was recently made by a large middle- 
Western road in its placing of sets of the Eliot 
five-foot-shelf books in the library cars of its express 
trains. That Marcus Aurelius and John Woolman 
and their comrades should have failed to captivate 
the commercial traveller and other patrons of the 
road is not at all to the discredit of Dr. Eliot's 
chosen authors, nor very much to the discredit of 
the travellers. The mood of neither the pleasure 
tourist nor the business traveller is suited to the 
reading of so serious literature as that embraced in 
the Eliot list ; and it was doubtless in tardy recog- 
nition of this fact that the company decided to 
withdraw the unappreciated volumes and leave its 
patrons to the undisputed enjoyment of their news- 
papers, their ten-cent magazines, their fifty-cent 
paper-covered novels and their cigars. The ideal 
traveller would of course be glad to relieve the 
monotony of transit across the western prairies by 
losing himself in Homer or Shakespeare, in Plutarch 
or Pliny ; but those who purvey to the literary tastes 
of a trainload of more or less tired and worried and 
fretful folk, have to face a condition, not a theory. 

TWO CURIOUS REASONS FOR THE ENGLISH LIKING 

OF AMERICAN NOVELS have been discovered by the 
London literary correspondent of a New York jour- 
nal. As they are almost the last that might have 
occurred to one, they are worth giving. Careful 
investigation has revealed to this inquirer that the 
English middle-class mother feels it safe, as a rule, 
to entrust an American work of fiction, unread, to 
the hands of her daughter or daughters, which is 
more than she dares do with the more ''advanced" 
native productions, especially when the latter are 
written by women. Secondly, the heroine of the 
American novel is well-gowned, at least by the illus- 
trator, which is not so often the case with the ladies 
of English fiction. The existence of other causes 
for the increasing vogue of our novels in England 
is admitted by this authority ; but who would have 
thought that correct conduct and correct costume 
would have proved so potent in swelling sales. 

INTERBIBLIOTHECAL RIVALRY, like intercollegiate 
rivalry and business competition, has its admir- 
able aspect, and also its less admirable. The yearly 
counting-up of circulation and attendance shows 
a commendable desire to keep all the patronage 
already won, and to win more ; but it also reminds 
one of the daily newspaper's striving to outdo its 
competitors in circulation and in number of adver- 
tisements printed. A brief passage in the current 
annual report of the Galesburg Public Library fur- 



nishes food for thought and for some mild amuse- 
ment. The librarian, after naming certain reasons 
why the library was unable to do more than hold its 
own, adds : " Further than this, the Knox College 
library was reopened, and naturally took some of the 
student patronage from us. Moreover, this must 
be reckoned with in the future too, for as the col- 
lege library becomes better equipped for the use of 
the students, their patronage, which has always been 
a large element in our work, will be transferred in a 
greater or less degree to the college library." In- 
stead of a note of rejoicing at the increased library 
facilities of the community, one detects here a cer- 
tain tone of sadness. 

A MARK TWAIN MONUMENT IN HEIDELBERG, 
where the plan of " A Tramp Abroad " was con- 
ceived, is to be erected by the American colony 
there. This rather unexpected memorial will take 
the form of a statue of the great humorist, and the 
necessary fund has already been subscribed; at 
least so says the report from the university town on 
the Neckar. A statue of Mark Twain in Germany, 
whose language and whose manners and customs 
he delighted in poking fun at, and whose national 
genius is so radically unlike that of our American 
humorist, must strike the observer as something of 
an anomaly. On American soil must ultimately be 
erected, in some shape or other, the chief monument 
to him whose humor, while it contributed to the 
gaiety of many nations, was relished to the full only 

by his own. 

/ 

PUBLICITY FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES, through local 
newspaper notices, quarterly or monthly bulletins, 
and other sufficiently decorous and dignified meth- 
ods, seems legitimate and desirable. The Haverhill 
(Mass.) Public Library reports the appearance of 
such newspaper notices (gratuitously printed) on 
sixty-six days of last year. Thirty-three lists of 
new books, and thirty-three of books and articles on 
special subjects, were thus brought to the people's 
attention. The recorded circulation of nearly two 
hundred thousand, among a population of about 
forty-two thousand, may serve as a proof of the 
wisdom of this policy of publicity. It is to be 
noted, however, as in harmony with experience 
elsewhere, that the number of books lent to school- 
children through the schools, in that city, fell off 
last year to the extent of nearly eleven hundred. 
In this matter of bringing home to the town's peo- 
ple the fact that they own, and too often neglect to 
profit by, a fine collection of the very best literature, 
why might it not be well to secure for advertising 
purposes a portion of the omnipresent billboard, 
even at the risk of crowding out some of the regular 
announcements of things eatable, drinkable, smok- 
able, and wearable? ... 

PECUNIARY ENCOURAGEMENT FOR LITERARY 
TALENT, as proposed by Mr. Upton Sinclair, is fav- 
ored by nine authors of note, whose letters to Mr. 
Sinclair are printed in a recent issue of " The Inde- 
pendent," as also are the protests from seven equally

well-known writers, to whose number Mr. Henry 
James, too unwell to write a letter, is to be added. 
His brother, the noted psychologist and pragmatist, 
puts the matter pithily : In our scribbling age, 
what is publicly most needed seems to be some kind 
of machinery for suppressing literary production 
rather than stimulating it." Worn-out authors who 
have served faithfully the cause of good literature, 
and have received but scant material reward for 
their labors, he thinks might well be held worthy of 
a pension; but "as for the young, let them scratch 
as they may, and devil take the hindmost." In this 
age of Carnegie foundations and endowed research, 
and multiplying scholarships and fellowships, there 
would seem to be enough provision for first aid to

Longfellow's poems, while Shakespeare's name

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the review of Miss Gertrude Hall's translation of 
"Chantecler," published in your issue of August 16, on 
page 84, with our name at the bottom of the column, 
your reviewer, Mr. Lewis Piaget Shanks, makes the 
assertion that six Hues have been omitted from the 
Prologue. With respect to our book this is a false 
statement, and one which we consider damaging. Six 
lines may have been omitted from " Hampton's Maga- 
zine " (we have not verified Mr. Shanks there) ; but 
he is wrong, as it happens, to assume that they were 
omitted also from our book. That it was an assumption 
seems proved by the fact that no copy of the book could 
possibly have reached your office before your issue con- 
taining the review was put to press.

THE L.IFE STORY OF AN ODD-JOB MAN.* 

The one book that every man is supposed to 
have it in him to write lias been produced by 
Mr. George Meek, who until recently pushed 
(or pulled) a bath chair at various beach-resorts 
in England, was for some years an active 
worker in the cause of Socialism, and at present 
enjoys the protection and countenance of Mr. 
H. G. Wells, who vouches for him in an inter- 
esting Introduction. He has also turned his 
hand to countless other casual occupations, in- 
cluding poetry ; but, he says, " I have come to 
the conclusion that I have no vocation for verse- 
making, much less poetry, though a few odds 
and ends of mine have been printed and one 
song published with music : I have never heard 
of anyone singing it, however." These few 
quoted words give the keynote of the book, 
dispassionate, detached, objective statement of 
facts, always well within the truth, and resorting 
to no art but the difficult one of entire natural- 
ness. No wonder Mr. Wells declares that " he 
has produced a living work that will defy the 
embargo of Mr. Mudie and all the libraries" 
an embargo which some of Mr. Meek's candor 
in the treatment of facts may very conceivably 
invite, while the polished and gilded eroticism of 
the " society novel " passes muster even before 
the severe scrutiny of " Miss Timmins " and her 
kind. 

The vogue attained by such unvarnished 
accounts of hand-to-mouth existence as have 
been written by the late Josiah Flynt, by Mr. 
William H. Da vies, by Mr. Lee Meriwether, and 
by other professional or amateur tramps, shows 
that readers enjoy having the hard realities of 
life served them (in good print and binding) 
without sauce ; but they have seldom or never 
met with a more engrossing narrative of des- 
perate poverty than this simple, yet in its way 
wonderfully eventful, life -history of a bath 
chair-man. There is in it no spectacular tramp- 
ing or " bumming," no voluntary experience of 
prison life, though there is one involuntary term 
of imprisonment for debt, and no curious explor- 
ing of the purlieus of wickedness. It is just the 
unembroidered and unsensational record of an 
up-hill struggle for existence, and yet it is pre- 
sented with such an unconscious artistry that 
it holds the attention from Ix'^iniiinj; to i-ncl.

What avails it, we ask ourselves, to study rhet- 
oric at college and to write laborious themes, 
when a Bunyan or a Meek can thus make our 
labors ridiculous and cause our favorite classic 
authors to pale their ineffectual fires ? 

Eastbourne was the birthplace and for most 
of his life the home of our chair-man. (The 
book's happy ending, with the appearance of a 
well-to-do uncle from Vancouver, shows why 
one cannot confidently assert that Eastbourne 
is Mr. Meek's present abiding-place.) Scanty 
schooling fell to the lot of George Meek, who, 
being early consigned to the care of a grand- 
father who soon afterward died, found himself 
obliged at a tender age to shift for himself. 
Worse than that, he had to work at precarious 
jobs for his living, and was dispossessed of his 
wages by an unnatural mother who returned 
from America, rather inopportunely for her 
boy's best good, after her husband had lost his 
life in the Brooklyn theatre tragedy of 1876. A 
certain native refinement and passion for the 
ideal appear in the lad, according to his own 
account of this period. He says : 

"I had few, if any, pleasures besides my reading. 
. . . Most of the boys I got to know through working 
with them were too filthy in their habits and conversa- 
tion to suit me, and I made no girl friends; I was 
usually very badly dressed, and unless I made a few 
coppers unknown to my mother I never had any pocket- 
money. And I was naturally very shy. 1 buried myself 
as much as I could in my readings and my day-dreams 
to escape the irksome realities of everyday life. Unless 
trouble was very acute and pressing I could nearly 
always withdraw my mind from my environment into 
a land of dreams a land which was my very own, 
where great and glorious things happened. This faculty 
I have enjoyed ever since I can remember, though of 
late years I find it less easy to detach myself from my 
surroundings, and the visions I see are less vivid." 

A studious house-painter from Nottingham 
converted young Meek from an indifferent sort 
of Anglican into a firmly convinced agnostic, 
and he tells us that he has since had only 
occasional relapses into religion. But, far re- 
moved though he is from religious enthusiasm, 
he has always been a worshipper of the fair sex, 
owing, he thinks, what little strain of poetry 
there is in his temperament to the fact that from 
his earliest years he has been given to idealizing 
women. " Although my experience leads me to 
conclude that I am mistaken," he confesses, " I 
always like to think of them as being but a little 
lower than the angels." Knowing now his atti- 
tude toward religion and toward women, we 
have some accurate conception of the man 
himself. A passage here and there from his 



autobiography will help to complete the picture. 
Of the early Eastbourne days he writes : 

" As I remember, I used sometimes to have to do 
very hard and even dangerous work pushing heavy 
tradesmen's trucks, carrying heavy loads, and standing 
outside second or third story windows to clean them. 
But while all my money was taken from me I was 
badly fed and clothed. Once I was at work for a 
well-to-do tradesman in Terminus Road ; he was exceed- 
ingly religious, so much so that he would not allow his 
children to go to Christmas parties. One day he set 
me to clean out the space in front of the cellar window 
which was covered by a[n] iron grating in the pavement 
in front of his shop window. Here I found about four- 
pence three-farthings in coppers, and got into trouble 
because I stuck to it ! He was a preacher for one of 
the obscure sects which drone their monotonous dirges 
(you can't call them ' hymns ') in various holes and 
corners about the town." 

To this adolescent period preceding the bath 
chair misery belongs also a brief experience of 
farming life in America " at Warsaw, Wy- 
oming county, U. S. A ," where dwelt a great- 
uncle and some cousins, and where he enjoyed 
the good cheer of his kinsfolks' bounteous table 
and the unaccustomed freedom of frontier coun- 
try life ; but the half-blind weakling was not the 
man for subduing the western wilderness, and 
back he soon went to the uncertain vicissitudes 
of unskilled labor at the smallest of wages. It 
was in February, 1891, that he sank, as he says, 
to the "profession" of bath chair-man. He 
presents successively the darker and the brighter 
side of the calling : 

" If you would know the horror of black despair go 
out with a bath chair day after day, with chair-owner 
or landlord worrying you for rent, food needed at home, 
and get nothing. Stare till your eyes ache; pray with 
aching heart to a God whom you ultimately curse for 
His deafness. And this not for weeks, but year after 
year. 

" Among the chair-men I have known since I first 
began to work at the calling seven have gone mad, 
many have taken to drink, others have died in the 
workhouse or are there still. The work demoralizes 
everyone in some way. It sets man against man. Some 
will do the meanest things to get work away from others. 
For instance, men have gone to my customers and told 
them I could not see, or that I was a Socialist, or that 
I drank. It is quite a common thing for me to get cus- 
tomers and suddenly lose them. One of the men tried 
to get the contract work I was doing last year away 
from me by telling the lady I was a Socialist, but she 
happened to be that rara avis a sensible woman and took 
no notice of it. In fact, she gave me some of Mr. 
Wells's books, besides some of the R. P. A. cheap 
reprints." 

The author stops at this part of the book to 
tell the reader that he is writing in the spare 
moments of his heart-breaking occupation, that 
he has a chair weighing about three hundred-

weight to draw, and that he is not strong. Hut 
on the brighter side such cheering incidents as 
the following were not unknown to him : 

" One Sunday in June, a few years ago, I had stood 
from eight in the morning till eight at night on the 
corner of Wilmington Square without earning a penny. 
I was pretty low-spirited. I was hiring my chair from 
a very hard man, and I had no money for him or myself 
either. As I pulled off the stand to go home, a gentle- 
man called to me. I hoped he wanted to engage me, 
but he only wanted a light. 

" Very busy ? ' he asked. 

" No,' I said ; ' I 'm sorry to say I 've been here since 
eight o'clock this morning and have n't had a job.' 

"'That's hard lines,' he said; 'here's half a crown 
for you. Are you married ? ' 

Yes,' I said, thanking him. 

" ' Any children ? ' he asked. 

"'Yes,' 1 said; 'one little girl.' 

"'Oh,' he said, putting his hand in his pocket, 
4 here 's another five shillings ! ' " 

Mr. Meek's unhesitating acceptance of such 
occasional offerings as the above-mentioned 
seems at first a little inconsistent with his evi- 
dent high-mindedness and his sturdy sense of 
personal independence ; but a starving wife and 
child at home will drive one to worse things than 
the taking of alms, and perhaps he found some- 
where in his socialistic creed a justification for 
accepting a part of the rich man's unearned in- 
crement. In this connection may be given the 
concluding paragraph of his important chapter 
entitled " My Socialist Work" : 

" Although I have ceased to take a very active part 
in politics for some time, I am entirely in sympathy 
with the latter ['. e., the Socialists]. Some day the 
workers will tire of mere politicians of every shade and 
will organize themselves for the definite struggle with 
Capitalism. Then, thoroughly grounded in the eco- 
nomics and ethics of Socialism, they will know what to 
do. It will be no great loss to the idle rich for them 
to live useful, healthy lives, nor to the business man to 
be relieved of the ever-increasing strain of competition. 
The worker will have no fear of unemployment or of 
want through sickness or old age. The reign of hatred 
engendered by the competition of individuals and the 
war of classes will give place to that of ' Peace on earth, 
goodwill to men.' " 

The prosperous uncle's entrance on the scene, 
near the end of the book, and his offer of a home 
and a living in Vancouver to the wretched chair- 
man and his family, seemed to Mr. Meek's 
publishers too much like the conventional 
story-book ending, and they hesitated about 
allowing it. But evidently they were over- 
ruled. Their own benefaction, as liberal-minded 
publishers, toward the new author also forms a 
part of the cheerful issue of the sombre narra- 
tive, as does furthermore the writer's reawa ke- 
ened hope to accomplish something still in the 
literary world. It is at present a treatise on 



ethics that he ha fixed his heart on writing. 
Hut he will never again make such a hit, both 
artistically and commercially, as he has made 
with his autobiography. He might now well be 
content to be a man of one book. 

Mr. Wells's Introduction gives the reader 
some acquaintance with Mr. Mrrk in his ill- 
fitting and dust-covered suit of black, peering 
about him, walking ill, and speaking indistinctly, 
but never abashed, never cringing, and never 
other than manly and gentlemanly in his bear- 
ing. For tht " (li'spical)!*- ^raimnarian " Mr. 
Wells has supreme contempt, and certainly the 
grammarian would be despicable who should 
bring the weight of his erudition to l-ar on 
Mr. Meek's maiden effort at book-writing. 
Nevertheless the grammarian, and also the 
ungrammared reader, may wonder what num- 
ber, exactly or approximately, is meant in Mr. 
Wells's statement that " Meek went to Ashford 
and met quite several men in a tiny room." 
Both uncritical and critical readers too will 
marvel at the book's display of unexpected 
learning side by side with something that can- 
not quite be called by so complimentary a 
name. Mr. Meek writes in an early chapter, for 
example, that his father and uncle, "like the 
Atridae," married sisters, and a few pages later 
speaks of a floor covered with coker-nut mat- 
ting." The literary sponsor's professed ap- 
proval of what is squalid and unedifying in the 
book seems a little excessive. But as a part of 
the life-story so effectively told, these portions 
take their place among the rest.

THE PROBLEMS OF THE SOUTH : 
A NORTHERN VIEW.* 



Just before the Civil War, Mr. Frederick I .aw 
Olmstead travelled extensively through tin- South 
and wrote a book telling what he saw. Profes- 
sor Albert Bushnell Hart has recently followed 
in his wake, and has written a book telling 
something of what he saw and a good deal of 
what he thinks. 

Professor Hart's excuse for writing this book, 
if excuse be necessary, is that criticism from 
an outsider is always illuminating. He would 
welcome an investigation of certain conditions 
in New England by a Southerner. But more 
than this : " In Reconstruction, the North 
attempted to bring about a new political system

with the honest expectation that it would solve 
the race question. Surely it has a right to 
examine the results of its action, with a view 
either to justify its attitude or to accept censure 
for it." The result is some things to praise 
and some to censure in the acts and attitude of 
both sections. Southern people in particular 
should welcome the book, not simply for the 
pleasant things which it occasionally says about 
them, but for the sober treatment of several 
prominent questions and the searching criti- 
cisms which it offers. The South has been 
rightly accused of being too resentful of criti- 
cism. Professor Hart was altogether right 
when he said, "A social institution that was 
too fragile to be discussed was doomed to be 
broken." Certainly the Southerner is now 
ready to discuss the negro problem possibly 
a little too ready, if the other man is a North- 
erner; and this seems almost to have misled 
Professor Hart into thinking that the negro 
question is by far the greatest of the Southern 
problems. Eight out of twenty-seven chapters 
of his book are devoted expressly to the negro, 
seven more have the negro for their key-note, 
and he plays at least a minor chord in practi- 
cally all the rest. In spite of all that is said 
and printed on the subject, the vast majority of 
Southern people pass many a day without ever 
thinking of the race problem as such. 

The Southern problem, according to Profes- 
sor Hart, is " how twenty million Whites and 
ten million Negroes in the Southern States 
shall make up a community in which one race 
shall hold most of the property, and all the 
government, and the other race shall remain 
content and industrious; in which one gets 
most of the good things of life and the other 
does most of the disagreeable work; in which 
the superior members of the inferior race shall 
accept all its disadvantages ; in which one race 
shall always be at the top and the other forever 
at the bottom ; yet in which there shall be peace 
and good will." If it is true that "the Negroes, 
who are a third of the population, own only a 
fortieth of the property in the South, and that 
one-fourth of the negroes own four-fifths of all 
negro property," then the problem is simply 
the world-old and world-wide question of the 
privileged few against the unprivileged many, 
complicated in this case by racial differences, 
antipathies, and prejudices, which the North 
once insisted should be ignored. Whether 
these differences are right or wrong, they are a 
" condition and not a theory," and must be 
dealt with accordingly. 



Another excuse given by Professor Hart for 
writing the book is that the North "has expert 
knowledge of race troubles and of ways to solve 
them," and that it may "offer something out 
of its own experience." This is not intended 
for humor. The "something" to offer is the 
Indian problem, not the earlier solution of 
indiscriminate killing, which is rightly repro- 
bated when applied to the negro, but the "land- 
in-severalty plan." 

When the Athenian envoys were defending 
at Sparta the policy of Athens in subjecting the 
other cities of Greece to her sway, they said: 
"The world has ever held that the weaker 
must be kept down by the stronger." And a 
great part of mankind has ever been kept in 
subjection of one kind or another. Yet voices 
have cried out against such monstrous philoso- 
phy, and it is no longer openly defended. On 
the contrary, we now accept the opposite phil- 
osophy, that the strong must help the weak to 
rise, though we are a little slow in putting it 
into practice. When the French serfs were 
freed they were not at once given land ; but in 
the general shakeup which immediately followed 
many of them managed to secure some. A few 
years later when the German peasant was freed 
he was given a liberal portion of the land he 
had tilled for centuries. At the very time when 
.the bonds were being stricken from our slaves, 
the Russian serfs were given lands, though on 
conditions they never could fulfil, conditions 
which were finally removed in the recent Rus- 
sian revolution. Even Great Britain is at last 
atoning for centuries of wrong by helping the 
Irish to acquire land. But it was left to demo- 
cratic America to strike the shackles of slav- 
ery from millions of men, and then give them 
the ballot instead of bread i. e., land on which 
to make it. Not only did they give the freed- 
men no land; they even left to an impoverished 
section practically the whole task of educating 
them. 

The " forty acres and a mule " dream of the 
negroes was one which the nation rested under 
some obligations to fulfil. Professor Hart's 
explanation of the reason why this was not done 
is that the North was so blind that it " honestly 
supposed " that " the ballot would at the same 
time protect the black against white aggression, 
and would educate him into the sense of such 
responsibility that there would be no negro 
aggression." This is simply the old mistake 
of eighteenth and nineteenth century political 
philosophy, that political and civil liberty is a 
panacea for all our social ills. Do the ballot

and the writ of habeas corpus protect the steel 
workers of Pittsburg, the coal miners of where- 
ever there is coal, or the sweatshop workers of 
wherever there are sweatshops? What men need 
is genuine economic freedom not the laissez 
''///' kind and the right to protect them- 
selves in its possession. The North was a little 
behind Europe in 1865 on this question ; but 
had she reached its full solution then, she would 
have been decidedly in advance of the rest of 
the world. 

Now, it seems, the South is to be left alone in 
the solution of her peculiarly difficult problem ; 
for Professor Hart tells us that a propaganda 
is no longer possible, "the North has too 
much on its own hands in curing the political 
diseases of its cities, in absorbing the foreigners," 
and, he ought to have added, in settling the re- 
lations of labor and capital. The South was a 
little slow in rejecting the ancient Greek phi- 
losophy of subjection. She, in common with 
the rest of this country, has accepted the an- 
tithesis of this doctrine that of helpfulness. 
A social philosophy which reverses the old order 
is sometimes slow to be realized in working insti- 
tutions ; but the South has at last made a begin- 
ning. When the North has solved its social and 
economic problems, beside which the curing of 
the political diseases of the cities is but a sum- 
mer pastime, perhaps the South will have made 
some progress. Meantime it is helpful to the 
South to know that she has the generous sym- 
pathy of the North, which now recognizes that 

she is sincere. __ ,

THE PROBLEMS OF THE SOUTH: 
AN ENGLISH VIEW.* 



The English journalist and author, Mr. 
William Archer, has written a book on the 
American Race Problem, with this dedication : 
* To H. G. Wells, with whom I so rarely dis- 
agree that when I do I must needs write a book 
about it." Since Mr. Wells, in The Future 
of America," came to the conclusion that the 
Southern whites were wholly wrong in their 
attitude toward their race problems, we expect 
to find quite a different account in Mr. Archer's 
book. And so we do. But it is not undiscrim- 
inating in its sympathy for the views of the

the Race Problem. By William Archer. New York : E. P. 
Dutton & Co. 



Southern whites, and it is full of interesting 
facts, discussions, and opinions ; while in many 
matters the author exhibits a freshness of 
thought and an originality of ideas that are wel- 
come to one weary of the stale American argu- 
ments and conventional statements. The book 
contains accounts of the author's travels in the 
South, in Cuba, and in Panama ; of his obser- 
vations of negro life in city and country, of 
negro homes and schools, of the relations be- 
tween the races, of " jim crow " cars, serfdom, 
and prohibition. Brief quotations from the 
Introduction will give Mr. Archer's conception 
of the American Race Problem : 

" Ought the colour-lines drawn by Nature to be 
enforced by human ordinance, and even by geographical 
segregation ? Or ought they to be gradually obliter- 
ated by free intermingling and intermarriage. Or, 
while intermarriage is forbidden (whether by law or 
public sentiment), is it possible for people of different 
colours to dwell together in approximately equal num- 
bers and on terms of democratic equality ? Or is it 
for the benefit of both races that one race should always 
maintain, by social and political discriminations, its 
superiority over the other ? Or is this opinion a mere 
hypocritical disguise of the instinct which begot, and 
maintained throughout the ages, the institution of 
shivery ?" 

The truth is, it seems to me, that no race problem, 
properly so called, arises until two races are found 
occupying the same territory in such an approach to 
equal numbers as to make it a serious question which 
colour shall ultimately predominate." 

" The race problem means (in its only convenient 
definition) the problem of adjustment between two very 
dissimilar populations, locally intermingled in such pro- 
portions that the one feels its racial identity potentially 
threatened, while the other knows itself in constant 
danger of economic exploitation. Now these condi- 
tions, as a matter of experience, arise only where a 
race of very high development is brought into contact 
with a race of very low development, and only where 
the race of low development is at the same time tena- 
cious of life and capable of resisting the poisons of 
civilization. In other words, the race problem, as here 
defined, is a purely Afro-European or Afro-American 
problem." 

The views and actions of the Southern whites, 
Mr. Archer considers natural, under the cir- 
cumstances, normal. He declares that there is 
no other race-problem in the world, and never 
has been except in the South, for never else- 
where did such conditions exist. His opinions 
may be summed up briefly : The problem is 
acute, and no solution is evident ; the jim 
crow '' car, etc., is necessary ; the white South 
is very wrong in its indifference to the abuses 
of labor laws, resulting in peonage ; the prohi- 
bition movement has been good for the negro ; 
the average negro desires the amalgamation of

THE DIAL

the races, and the Southern whites know that 
he wants it ; negro civilization is only a veneer. 
The author insists upon one principle : that the 
whole trouble is due to physical dissimilarity. 
The negro to him is so grotesque a being, so 
unlike the white, that he is repelled. "The per- 
manent difficulty underlying all impermanent 
ones, that time, education, Christian charity, 
and soap and water may remove, is that of 
sheer unlikeness. Oh ! they are terribly unlike, 
these two races ! " But " if the Ethiopian could 
but change his skin, how trifling would be the 
problem raised by his ignorance, shiftlessness, 
poverty, and crime!" For a solution, Mr. 
Archer suggests the four threadbare possibili- 
ties : Extinction ; the Atlanta Compromise ; 
Amalgamation ; Segregation. The first and 
third being out of the question, he prefers the 
fourth. That the Atlanta Compromise the 
suggestion of Booker T. Washington that each 
race will work out its own destiny, within its 
own sphere, each race aiding the other will 
ever come to pass, he doubts. Will not the 
work of the Tuskegees and the Hamptons, the 
industrial training of the negro, create a new 
form of friction ? "I did not doubt for a 
moment," he says, "that Mr. Washington's 
work was wise and salutary ; but I wondered 
whether the material and moral uplifting of the 
negro was going to bring peace or a sword. 
In other words, do the essential and funda- 
mental defects of the situation really lie in the 
defects of the negro race?" An important 
phase of the problem, usually slurred over by 
writers on this subject, is dwelt upon by Mr. 
Archer : the psychological effect of the constant 
uneasiness of the whites, especially the lower 
classes, about their women. Herein, of course, 
lies one important cause of the frequent furious 
and seemingly causeless outbreaks of whites 
against negroes. While sympathizing with the 
Southern whites, the author nevertheless points 
out some inconsistencies and weaknesses in 
their position. He is probably not altogether 
just in his estimate of negro home-life, of the 
domestic melioration attained by the upper class 
of negroes " resolute refinement," he calls it, 
" veneer." The boasted negro homes, he says, 
are not homes at all, but mere " imitative and 
mechanical tributes to the American ideal of 
the prosperous and cultivated homes." There 
might be more justification in this criticism 
were it not also true of a very large number of 
the homes of whites. 

WALTER L. FLEMING. 



THE GENTLE ART or " SICHELIZESTG." * 



Mr. Walter Sichel is known on both sides 
of the Atlantic for a series of biographies 
culminating last year in a life of Sheridan. 
His books have made a favorable impression 
on many reviewers, as they well might; for the 
style is vivacious, and a large part of the matter 
appears, on first sight, to be new. After the 
publication of the Sheridan biography, however 
Mr. Sichel's extensive claims to originality, 
announced in the preface and repeated many 
times in footnotes and elsewhere, began to be 
questioned in private and, eventually, in the 
press. It was intimated that, although Mr 
Sichel had indeed added to our knowledge of 
Sheridan, he had also drawn heavily upon the 
life of Sheridan by the late Mr. W. Fraser Rae, 
while treating his memory with scant courtesy ; 
that he apparently claimed to be the first to call 
attention to literary parallels which had been 
observed by other writers on Sheridan ; and that 
in his bibliography he marked by asterisks several 
editions of Sheridan's works and single plays as 
his own discoveries, though they may be found 
in other and earlier bibliographies of Sheridan. 
Mr. Sichel, it has been alleged, did all this while 
he professed acquaintance with " every known 
and some unknown editions " of Sheridan. 

Then came, last spring, Mr. Sichel's " Sterne: 
A Study," within a year after the publication 
of the " Life and Times of Laurence Sterne," 
by the writer of this review. Mr. Percy Fitz- 
gerald, "a pioneer" in Sterne studies, after 
reading the new book, sent a letter to the Lon- 
don " Saturday Review " (April 30), protesting 
against Mr. Sichel's literary methods, to de- 
scribe which he coined the verb " sichelize " 
after the analogy of " bowdlerize " derived from 
Dr. Thomas Bowdler, who spent his time in 
mutilating Shakespeare in the interest of pub- 
lic morality. According to Mr. Fitzgerald, " to 
sichelize " means to re-hash old facts and old 
ideas so as to give the impression that they are 
new. To quote him directly, " Mr. Sichel's 
system is to come along after the hard-working 
harvest-men have gone home to rest, and help 
himself from their granaries." A biographer 
may of course refer, in his preface or in an 
occasional footnote, to previous laborers in the 
same field ; but these acknowledgments should 
be on unessential points, or on points of dis- 
agreement, in order that the impression of

indebtedness may be kept within reasonable 
bounds ; and while claiming to bring to bear 
upon his work a large amount of " unpub- 
lished " or " unnoticed " material, he must really 
add a new document or two, else he will have 
nothing whatever to stand upon in case the day 
of reckoning ever comes. Mr. Sichel, for 
example, has made use of two letters in his new 
book not accessible to other biographers, and 
of a memorandum and two other letters which, 
though previously published elsewhere, had 
never been quoted in a life of Sterne. He also 
publishes for the first time two or more second- 
rate portraits of Sterne and an interesting por- 
trait of Mrs. Sterne, if indeed it be Mrs. Sterne. 
He really had enough new material for a letter 
to a weekly periodical, but not quite enough 
for a magazine article. Now the reviewer has 
no quarrel with anyone over the use he may 
make of the " Life and Times of Laurence 
Sterne," for the book now belongs to the public. 
It has been amusing rather than annoying to 
see Mr. Sichel tossing about, as stale and time- 
worn, the results of others' investigations before 
they were a year old, or treating conjectures as 
facts, though the writer of them now knows 
some of them not to be such. One may con- 
gratulate himself on escaping better than Mr. 
Fitzgerald, who seems to have been converted 
by one of Mr. Sichel's references into a certain 
" Mr. FitzPatrick." For further consolation, 
we are here reminded how Professor Lounsbury 
recently lost much more than his identity under 
the feminine hand of the author of a recent 
biography called " Mr. Pope : His Life and 
Times." Doubtless others also observed, on 
reading this life of Pope, that Miss Symonds 
was under great obligations to Professor Louns- 
bury for certain of her chapters, and that her 
only acknowledgement was a mere reference in 
her preface to MRS. [sic] Lounsbury's " valu- 
able book." In these days of " sichelizing," 
one should be thankful that he is not unsexed ! 

It will be instructive as well as amusing to 
illustrate Mr. Sichel*s apparent literary meth- 
ods, for if " sichelize " and its derivatives are 
to come into common use we should know what 
the words mean. Here is a sichelism lying on 
the surface, to be picked up by anyone : 

Fifty-odd pages of Mr. Sichel's book are given 
over to the publication of Sterne's "Journal to 
Eliza." Without exactly saying so, Mr. Sichel 
implies in his preface that he is publishing the 
Journal for the first time. His English pub- 
lishers and the English reviewers have so an- 
nounced it or congratulated him upon it. When 



Mr. Sichel's attention was subsequently called 
to the fact that the Journal had been published 
in New York back in 1904 as a part of the 
works of Sterne, his retort was that " the Jour- 
nal may have been transcribed in Germany or 
Kamschatka," but that he was the first to pub- 
lish it in England. Not quite satisfied, perhaps, 
with the implication that an English imprint 
(Germany and the United States not counting 
at all) is necessary to publication, Mr. Sichel 
went on to say that he really never claimed to 
publish the document for the first time. His 
publishers and the reviewers had only inferred 
it, he said, from a paragraph in the preface 
beginning " Fresh matter assists these pages " 
and ending with the entire Journal to Eliza 
speaks for itself " (" Saturday Review," 25th 
June). Mr. Sichel seems to have forgotten a 
paragraph in his book (page 17) relative to the 
" unpublished Journal to Eliza,' which will be 
found at the end of this volume." 

In a similar manner Mr. Sichel present* 
Sterne's correspondence. Letters are intro- 
duced with a declaration that they are " new " 
or with a sentence from which the uninformed 
reader infers that they are new, though they 
may be found in previous biographies or in 
various editions of Sterne's works. And so it 
is with other minor documents. On page 69, 
for instance, Mr. Sichel takes up Sterne's 
" Dream " with the remark that it " deserves 
more attention than it has received," when as 
a matter of fact it has received from M. Paul 
Stapfer (who first published it) and from other 
writers on Sterne, five times the attention de- 
voted to it by Mr. Sichel. More curious still, a 
letter on page 169 (which Mr. Sichel says " finds 
noplace in the printed collections' ) appears with 
a superscription, though there is none in the ex- 
isting manuscript of the letter or in the letter as 
hitherto published. Again, M. Tollot, one of 
Sterne's Continental friends, never quite identi- 
fied, is several times mentioned by Mr. Sidu-l :is 
" the Abbe* Tollot " (see pp. 215 and 227); but 
there seems to be no warrant for the title except 
that an educated Frenchman of the eighteenth 
century was sometimes an abbe*. And so Mr. 
Sichel proceeds merrily through his volume. 

Another form of sichelism is Mr. Su-lid's 
claim to some fact or incident which we are 
informed has been "unnoticed" or " UUJMT- 
ceived " or " missed " by other writers on Sternr. 
and consequently first noticed or pom-ivcd by 
himself. Out of many sichelisms of this kind. 
we may cite two or three. On page 34 is the 
" unnoticed fact" that Sterne has in one of the

later volumes of " Tristram Shandy " a Curate 
D'Estella, as if in memory of the romantic 
retreat called D'Estella where he courted Miss 
Lumley in his youth. This fact was noticed 
many years ago by Mr. Fitzgerald in his " Life 
of Sterne " (I. 23). Again, it is implied in 
Mr. Sichel's preface that he has discovered 
that the " Jenny " of " Tristram Shandy " is 
the " Kitty " of Sterne's correspondence. But 
all this is in Fitzgerald (I. 105-106). On 
page 129, Mr. Sichel goes so far as to say that 
the reference to " Kitty " in the last installment 
of " Tristram Shandy" (1767) " has never yet 
been noticed," and then proceeds to quote the 
references to her down to 1767, much as they 
have appeared in other biographies of Sterne. 
And, finally, Mr. Sichel says (p. 155) that " the 
real cause " of the meeting between Sterne and 
Warburton " has escaped biographers, who have 
removed the incident to a subsequent phase of 
their squabble." The "real cause" of the 
meeting and the approximate date of it (all that 
Mr. Sichel gives) have been given by Fitzgerald, 
Traill, Sidney Lee, and by the present re- 
viewer, who, in fact, stated the exact day of 
the first meeting along with the incidents that 
led up to it (" Life and Times of Sterne," 
pp. 196-198). Who are one may ask 
the biographers of Sterne ? 

Were there space for it, it would be equally 
amusing to illustrate the perils attending sich- 
elization, from the numerous misstatements, 
outside of claims, in Mr. Sichel's volume. On 
page 106, we are told, for example, that 
Sterne's " Watch-Coat " was " only posthum- 
ously printed." The " Watch-Coat," as printed 
in Sterne's lifetime (before the appearance of 
" Tristram Shandy " and " The Sentimental 
Journey ") is fully described in the " Life and 
Times of Sterne" (pp. 164-177 and 531). 
But, to proceed no further, Mr. Sichel, when 
confronted with his claims and misstatements, 
replies that they are unimportant, for it was not 
his intention to write a biography of Sterne. 
A pertinent question in rejoinder is, Why make 
claims if they are unimportant? Indeed, his 
book would stand the test no better if it were 
examined as a study. If Mr. Sichel is ac- 
quainted with the literature on Sterne, he must 
know that the aspects in which he has presented 
him, as humorist, sentimentalist, dreamer, and 
precursor of modern impressionism, have noth- 
ing novel about them at all. It was perhaps 
worth while to re-work the old mines ; but it 
savors of the promoter to advertise them as 
fresh discoveries. -yy ^ CROSS. 



BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS. 

Mark Twain's Xt is a wise word that the Polish- 

premeditated ers of "Mark Twain's Speeches" 
impromptus. (Harper) have chosen from his own 
writings as a prefatory caution to the reader : 
" There is no more sin in publishing an entire vol- 
ume of nonsense than there is in keeping a candy- 
store with no hardware in it. It lies wholly with the 
customer whether he will injure himself by means 
of either, or will derive from them the benefits which 
they will afford him if he uses their possibilities 
judiciously." As occasional reading, these speeches, 
delivered at various times in the last four decades 
of his life, are generally of a nature to entertain 
and to amuse, although their quiet perusal may not 
move the reader to praise them quite so highly as 
does Mr. Howells, who heard many of them at 
banquet or other festal occasion, and who contri- 
butes a brief introduction to the volume. We learn 
from him, without surprise, that it was his friend's 
practice to prepare his oratorical exercises before- 
hand, to commit them carefully to memory, and to 
study their probable effect on his hearers. If the 
reader cannot always catch that spirit of conviviality 
and of cordial readiness to applaud even a labored 
witticism which commonly smooths the path of the 
after-dinner speaker, he can at least admire and 
enjoy the neatness and probably telling effect of 
many of the humorous turns taken by these short 
speeches. But there is little need, at this late day, 
to call attention to the qualities of Mark Twain's 
inimitable oratory. One fault we have to find, not 
with the book, but rather with the publishers. 
Their announcement on the wrapper says that 
" here will be found the speech delivered at Oxford 
when he received the Doctor's degree from that uni- 
versity, . . . the address delivered at the Aldrich 
Memorial meeting, etc." The et cetera we have 
easily found, but have turned every page in the 
book three times in vain search for the Aldrich 
memorial address and the alleged Oxford utterance. 
Mark Twain could defy the conventionalities, but 
we had not before heard that he astonished the 
assembled Oxonians by making a speech on the 
receipt of his doctorate. Hence the keenness of 
our disappointment in not finding this promised 
gem of oratory. Otherwise, the book is, in its way, 
all that could be desired. 



" The u i desire of Miss Sophie 

duckling of Shilleto Smith, in her recent volume 
literature." on j) ean Swift and his circle of friends 
(Putnam) is to refute certain unjust slanders and 
a few generally accepted beliefs about the character 
of one of the most interesting and perplexing fig- 
ures in the history of literature and of the Church. 
The tone of the book from cover to cover is that of 
an apologia, and the author's admiration for her 
subject causes her to magnify his sensitiveness and 
dominating influence while she denounces his en- 
emies in no mild phrases. In somewhat prismatic

imagery she says, in her Introduction: "I have 
written the life neither of a saint nor a fiend ; I 
have neither dragged him down to hell nor raised 
him to heaven, I have dressed him neither in 
black nor in white ; I have not attired him in scar- 
let, nor endowed him with a cloven foot, setting 
him to dance among friends worse than himself." 
With strong emphasis upon his sunless childhood 
and friendless youth, she portrays Swift as "the 
ugly duckling of the literary world." Poverty and 
disease, two factors which influenced his whole life, 
were "heritages" from his youth; and his hoy hood 
memories seem to have been largely grievances. 
With frequent excuses for his mistakes and their 
consequences, the author traces Swift's career as 
secretary to Sir William Temple, whom she calls 
" a moral iceberg," and interweaves much of politi- 
cal history into her account of the positions of influ- 
ence in State and Church which came to Swift, in 
his manhood, as a result of his early association 
with Temple. The personality of Swift is not pre- 
sented with graphic effect in many parts of this biog- 
raphy ; and the reader must turn to the more lucid 
though briefer life by Leslie Stephen to elucidate 
certain references that are indefinite or nnsequential 
in Miss Smith's pages. But in spite of defects of 
structure and frequent heaviness of style, the story 
of Swift's life is told faithfully, and certain portions 
show intuitive touches as the revealment of his 
disappointed hopes and ambitions, his cramped 
environment at Laracor, his sensitiveness to slight* 
and misjudgments, and his disfavor with Queen 
Anne. The innate belief of Swift in his own pow- 
ers, his assurance of an unfulfilled " vocation," and 
his dominating influence, almost brutal in kind, 
over both men and women, are emphasized. There 
is no new interpretation here of his relations with 
"Stella" and " Vanessa," although the author justi- 
fies, to her own mind, his imperiousness towards 
them. Incidental attention is given throughout the 
book to Swift's writings, and a later chapter deals 
with The Poet and the Moralist" 



Libraries and Dr ' Arthur E - Bostwick's pleasantly 
librarv tdenee descriptive and attractively illus- 
in America, trated account of "The American 
Public Library " ( Appleton ) is intended for both 
library workers and general readers. It is scholarly, 
and at the same time not too technical to be of gen- 
eral interest The author's experience as librarian 
in New York, Brooklyn, and St. Louis, where he 
not long ago succeeded Mr. Crunden as head of the 
public library of that city, and his recent holding of 
the presidency of the American Library Association, 
are a sufficient warrant of his ability to write under- 
standingly on his chosen subject Partly historical, 
but more largely descriptive and wisely suggestive, 
his book contains (for the somewhat bookish, at 
least) a greater amount of agreeable reading than 
its title might indicate. While he maintains a judi- 
ciously dispassionate attitude toward most questions 



of library policy, contenting liim>flf with presenting 
the arguments on hoth sides of such questions, he 
occasionally lets us see which way his bias tends, as 
in the open-shelf and clo-t-d-slu-lf controversy, and 
in the treatment of juvenile users of the library. 
Free access to a large part of the books and special 
attention to the young folk, including the increas- 
ingly popular story-hour, are favored by him. In 
a few matters of detail, the all but impossibility of 
attaining strict accuracy in a work of this sort is 
illustrated. His useful list of "State library com- 
missions, with official name of commission or board 
and title of executive officer," gives for Maryland, 
"Maryland Public Library Commission: Secretary," 
whereas the current report of this commission indi- 
cates that it should be, " Maryland State Library 
Commission: President" Further, the table of 
"American public libraries circulating over 100,000 
yearly " is less nearly up-to-date than might have 
been expected. Dr. Bostwick's scholarly work de- 
serves a place beside such accepted hooka of its 
kind as Edwards's " Memoirs of Libraries," Mr. 
Fletcher's " Public Libraries in America," and Pro- 
fessor H. B. Adams's " Public Libraries and Popular 
Education." 



A ttudv of 

mental 

vagaritt. 



Dr. Isador H. Coriat's main purpose 
in the writing of his volume entitled 
" Abnormal Psychology " ( Moffat, 
Yard & Co.) is an admirable one, as is likewise the 
plan upon which he proceeds. He groups the abnor- 
mal phenomena of the mind about the conception 
of the Subconscious, making Part I. the exploration 
of the Subconscious and Part II. the diseases of 
the Subconscious. In all that pertains to the clin- 
ical evidence and the description of cases and data, 
some of them original and all well-described and 
related, the work may be commended. Its chief 
lack is in furnishing the lay reader with a careful 
analysis of the concepts indispensable to the under- 
standing of the wayward and irregular appearances 
which it is the business of abnormal psychology to 
set in order. The same criticism applies within 
the first division, in which there is a clear setting 
forth of the recent methods of analyzing mental 
states and of revealing hidden motives and obstacles; 
but a decidedly less clear account of the significance 
of the observations. The scope of the work and 
the interest of the problems seem so admirably 
suited to disseminate a rational understanding of 
what is often sensationally and misleadingly consid- 
ered, that it is a matter of regret that a work so 
well planned should fail in what after all is an 
essential consideration, that of a clearer analysis 
and a richer setting of the objective data. None 
the less, considering the imperfections of contribu- 
tions in this field which aim to instruct and often 
mislead the public. Dr. Coriat's work will form a 
welcome addition to the group of books that are 
coming to be called for on the shelves of many a 
library. It is possible that if the author had more

carefully and more generously indicated his obliga- 
tions to other writers, and had introduced brief 
formulas which have already been reached in this 
field, the defect of his more general statements 
would have been relieved. 



Occasional ^ our * * >ro * essor William P. Trent's 
essays on books papers in the volume entitled " Long- 
and authors. fellow and Other Essays " (Crowell) 
were prepared in celebration of centenary, bicen- 
tenary, or tricentenary events in the literary world ; 
some were written as introductions to new editions 
of standard works ; while two at least have a more 
evident spontaneity than their fellows. The entire 
ten, however, though a little stale, from a publisher's 
point of view, are surprisingly fresh and attractive 
to the reader. To say the appropriate and signifi- 
cant thing so wittily and so well as does Professor 
Trent on the occasion of a literary anniversary 
gives literary anniversaries an adequate excuse for 
being. Beside Longfellow, he briefly treats Spenser, 
Johnson, Milton, and Poe, and also discusses the 
relations of history and literature, Scott's " Heart of 
Midlothian," Daudet's " Tartarin " books, and Thack- 
eray's verses, and gives a wholesome talk to would-be 
teachers. His style is warmed with a quiet humor 
and brightened at times with a flashing wit, while 
beneath all lies the sound scholarship without which 
the rest would be but emptiness and vanity. His 
Poe-enthusiasm crops out in frequent passing refer- 
ences to the subject of his closing essay, which itself 
was delivered before the Johns Hopkins University 
at the exercises in honor of the hundredth anniver- 
sary of Poe's birth. An incidental mention of Sir 
Walter Raleigh brings out the curious fact that the 
commonly accepted spelling of his name is "the 
only way out of some seventy odd forms that he 
seems never to have used." Nevertheless Professor 
Trent still writes " Raleigh," and not " Ralegh " or 
any other form. As another matter of minute detail, 
why does he say " financial " when he means " pecu- 
niary"? So thoroughly readable a collection of 
occasional essays does not often appear. 



A littie-known Although frequently small as to size, 
painter of the the books of Mr. Bernhard Berenson 
Sienee school. are never otherwise than significant 
as to art criticism. His latest volume, '' A Sienese 
Painter of the Franciscan Legend" (Lane), con- 
tains only seventy pages, and is a reprint of two 
articles published in " The Burlington Magazine " 
six years ago. The purpose of the book is to show 
that, as a painter of Franciscan ideals, there was a 
greater even than Giotto one Stefano Sassetta, 
born in Siena in 1392. That this comparatively 
little-known man is a greater artist than Giotto, 
Mr. Berenson does not claim, but that he was more 
lyrical, more rapturous, with an imagination of a 
type better fitted to penetrate the open secret of 
Franciscan doctrine, Mr. Berenson insists with em- 
phasis and strong conviction. He places side by 



side collotype illustrations of fourteen paintings by 
Sassetta, five by Giotto, and four of the school of 
Giotto, the latter being those over the tomb of St. 
Francis in the Lower Church at Assisi, commonly 
ascribed to Giotto himself, but which Mr. Berenson 
and Professor Venturi now unite in attributing to his 
followers. As an adequate rendering of the Fran- 
ciscan soul in art, according to Mr. Berenson, the 
whole range of painting offers nothing equal to 
Sassetta's nine panels, now scattered, but once form- 
ing the front and back of a single altar-piece. Mr. 
Berenson is himself the owner of the triptych forming 
the print. In its suggestions of an ecstatic harmony 
with the spirit of all things, there is but one picture 
in European art which approaches it Raphael's 
Transfiguration, in its upper portion. And even 
that is inferior, owing to its being less simply, less 
flatly designed, and to its relatively greater realism, 
both in the figures and the landscape. In conclusion, 
Mr. Berenson finds that Sassetta was not only one 
of the few masters in Europe of imaginative design, 
but the most important painter at Siena during the 
second quarter of the fifteenth century, the channel 
through which Sienese Trecento traditions passed 
and became transformed into those of the Quattro- 
cento, nearly all the later painters of Siena being 
his offspring. 

Theproares, " The Ascending Effort" (Dutton), 
of the race by Mr. George Bourne, owes its title 

through art. to Emerson's observation, in <'The 
Conduct of Life," that "no statement of the Universe 
can have any soundness which does not admit its 
ascending effort." The all-important factor in this 
ascending effort, according to Mr. Bourne, is the art 
instinct, art being conceived of as "a form of energy 
able to set up fresh energies in our physical being." 
With this broad meaning assigned to art, which 
itself is subdivided into fine art, craft, and play, it 
becomes easily possible to elaborate a theory of 
human development and social progress that presents 
many attractive features and beautifully explains 
many of the phenomena of individual and social 
evolution. There is, however, something almost too 
mechanical, too fatalistic, in parts of Mr. Bourne's 
doctrine to make it thoroughly inspiring ; as for 
instance: "At every hour of man's existence the 
same specific vitality which assembled the tissues of 
his body and gave them its own impress before he 
was born continues to assert itself. It leads him to 
approve in other people certain things for imitation ; 
it suggests his thoughts, and is the mainspring of his 
ambitions ; while to everything he does it gives its 
bias." Excellent, on the other hand, is his concep- 
tion of art as aiming always at a noble ideal that 
never is but always to be achieved, as " toiling on for 
centuries at a task never to be finished, providing 
the fine experiences from which choice ideas may be 
fashioned. . . . Still the tales of passion and adven- 
ture have to be rewritten, the dramas to be composed 
anew, the aspects of land and sea and people to be 



120

repainted. ..." Except that he makes art too 
inclusive, playing the parts of several other actors 
in the great drama, Mr. Bourne writes convincingly 
and well. There is moral and intellectual uplift in 
his book. _ 

Wage-earning Another volume on working-women 
women and and their problems, written from a 
thrir rrobirmt. gijghtly different angle to that of 
previous treatments, is Miss Mac Lean's " Wage- 
Earning Women " (Macmillan). The contents com- 
prise some of the results of an investigation carried 
on under the auspices of the National Board of the 
Young Women's Christian Association, and managed 
by the editor. A very wide field of industry and 
extent of territory were covered, the definite purpose 
being to discover the actual social conditions under 
which women all over the country labor, with a 
view to basing betterment work on this first-hand 
knowledge. The fields of labor chosen for investi- 
gation were those of paper, clothing, shoes, and 
textile manufactures in New England, New York 
City, and Chicago; work in the New Jersey towns; 
women toilers in the Middle West, with special 
reference to Iowa and Michigan ; hop-picking in 
Oregon; the fruit industries of California; and 
women in the coal-fields of Pennsylvania. In addi- 
tion, the actual improvement agencies already at 
work are described, and definite recommendations 
for still further improvement are made. The book 
is distinctly constructive, its chief value lying in its 
numerous suggestions for social betterment. But 
in form it is fragmentary and disconnected. One 
feels that greater fidelity and fulness might have 
been secured if the separate investigations had been 
described directly by their investigators, leaving it 
to the editor merely to summarize and interpret 
the whole. _ 



A roiiin ttone than once in the course of his 

in the world autobiographical narrative entitled 
o/butine... "Astir: A Publisher's Life-Story" 
(Small, Maynard & Co.), Mr. John Adams Thayer 
refers to himself as a rolling stone and disclaims any 
desire to gather moss, which he says is for ruins, 
not for wide-awake men. A " moss-back " he most 
certainly is not, as the account of his commercial 
successes in printing, publishing, advertising (his 
own goods and other people's), magazine-booming, 
and other kindred activities, makes plain. Of course 
the chief triumph of his career thus far has been 
the immense success of " Everybody's Magazine," 
which Mr. Lawson's " Frenzied Finance " and other 
popular features lifted speedily to a circulation of 
half a million and more a month. Less familiar to 
the public, but of almost equal interest, is the story 
of how Mr. Thayer and the Napoleonic Mr. Munsey 
tried for a month and a day to pull together in 
double harness. One especial service rendered by 
Mr. Thayer to the cause of honesty in the publish- 
ing world must not be overlooked. He discounte- 
nanced and, as far as he could, suppressed the 
fraudulent advertisement, the advertisement calcu- 



lated to catch the dollars of the sick and the feeble- 
minded. But he has left abundant work for others 
in this field of reform. On the reverse of his title- 
page appears an announcement somewhat remark- 
able in its form : " Published also in French under 
the title ' Les Etapes du Succes ; Souvenirs d'un 
' business man " AmeVieaine.' " Whatever his other 
attributes, there is nothing feminine or effeminate 
about this American business man. His is a virile 
tale, set forth with no maiden coyness. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



A few years ago, Miss Lucy H. Humphreys pre- 
pared a poetic anthology which she entitled "The 
Poetic Old World." She has now given us a com- 
panion volume on " The Poetic New World," issued by 
the same publishers (Holt & Co.). The pieces selected 
are essentially poems of places those which reHect 
touches of local color combined with historic associa- 
tions. Such a collection must necessarily lack the ele- 
ment of completeness, and represent largely the personal 
tastes of the compiler. Miss Humphreys's collection is 
interesting, and is presented in a compact and charming 
little volume which will find its place in the regard of 
poetry-lovers. 

The hoary superstitions concerning the deadly perils 
lurking in fresh air are giving way before the demon- 
strations of science. In his little book on " Open-Air 
Schools " (Ooubleday), Dr. Leonard P. Ayres, of the 
Department of Child Hygiene, Russell Sage Founda- 
tion, gives the history of this interesting educational 
development from its origin in the Charlottenburg 
Forest School, started in 1904, through similar estab- 
lishments elsewhere in Germany, in England, in Porto 
Rico, and in this country, down to the latest open-air 
schools of Hartford, Rochester, and Pittsburg. An 
appended bibliography of half a hundred titles gives 
some idea of the interest in this subject even so soon 
awakened both here and abroad. The book is copiously 
illustrated, and well provided with tables and charts in 
graphic demonstration of the merits of this movement 
" back to nature." 

" The School Department Room " is briefly but ably 
and clearly handled by Mr. John Cotton Dana in the 
latest number of his pamphlet series of expert treatises 
on " Modern American Library Economy as Illustrated 
by the Newark, N. J., Public Library" (Elm Tree 
Press, Newark). After a few pages of excellent doc- 
trine on the public library's legitimate place in the 
educational scheme, Mr. Dana describes, with aid of a 
diagram, the Newark library's children's room, and the 
work it sets itself to perform. Concerning the very 
natural and commendable interest in children manifested 
by many librarians, he says : " I do believe that we have 
allowed a pardonable enthusiasm to carry us too far. 
In the story-hour, for example, we have permitted our 
delight in the pleasure we can give, almost casually, to 
a very few of the children in our respective commu- 
nities, to blind us to the fact that we are, when we take 
up such work, not only stepping into another's Held, but 
grievously neglecting our own." The little treatise 
deserves a wider reading than that of the learners in 
library science for whom the series is especially designed.

NOTES. 



Mr. Francis Ferris Greenslet, a well-known writer 
and critic, formerly associate editor of "The Atlantic 
Monthly." and for three years chief literary adviser of 
the Houghton Mifflin Company, has been elected a 
director of the company. 

The Memoirs of Goldwin Smith, which are to be 
published shortly by the Macmillan Co., will give a 
very full story of his life, beginning with his earliest 
days and ending with certain chapters dealing with his 
later years that were dictated only a few weeks before 
his death. 

Of foremost interest among literary announcements 
of the Fall season are the " Life and Letters of Edmund 
Clarence Stedman," by his granddaughter, Miss Laura 
Stedman, which Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co. will pub- 
lish ; and the " Life and Letters of William Sharp," 
prepared by his wife, which is announced by Messrs. 
Duffield & Co. 

The success of Mr. Owen Johnson's later Lawrence- 
ville stories has led the Baker & Taylor Co. to issue a 
new edition of the first Lawrenceville volume, " The 
Eternal Boy," now published as " The Prodigious 
Hickey." Mr. Johnson's lively portrait of the Amer- 
ican " prep " schoolboy seems not unlikely to take a 
place on the same shelf with " Stalky & Co." 

" The Atheuseum " makes the interesting announce- 
ment that Sir George Trevelyan intends to finish his 
" History of the American Revolution " by another vol- 
ume, written on a new plan, and with a complete change 
of treatment. It will deal largely with Parliamentary 
and social interests, and the English and European 
aspects of the Revolution. 

An extended work on " The Literature of the South," 
by Mr. Montrose J. Moses, is announced by Messrs. 
Crowell. The book comprises a study of the subject 
from its beginning to the present time, and includes 
criticism of all the modern Southern writers. This 
work is the result of several years' research and study 
on the part of the author. 

Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., whose general pub- 
lishing business has been developed during the past few 
years to a very large extent, have now entered the edu- 
cational field. They have engaged to take charge of 
this branch of their publishing business, Mr. C. E. 
Ricketts, for many years connected with one of the 
largest school-book houses in the country. 

Dr. Arthur Howard Noll, the author of " A Short 
History of Mexico " and " From Empire to Republic," 
has written, in collaboration with Mr. A. Philip Mc- 
Mahon, an account of Miguel Hidalgo, " the Father of 
Mexican Independence." The book will be published 
early this month by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co., under 
the title " The Life and Times of Miguel Hidalgo y 
Costilla." 

A Centenary edition de luxe of Thackeray's works, 
which will contain, in addition to the original illustra- 
tions, a series of five hundred new plates by Mr. Harry 
Furniss, has been arranged for publication next year by 
Messrs. Macmillan. There is also in preparation for the 
centenary of (Thackeray a new revision of the "Biograph- 
ical Edition," for which Lady Ritchie has rearranged the 
biographical prefaces, making various changes and ad- 
ditions. The edition will be in twenty-six volumes, and 
the issue will begin, it is hoped, in the Autumn. 



"A Midsummer Memory: An Elegy on the late 
Arthur Upson," by his friend and fellow poet, Dr. 
Richard Burton, is announced for publication next 
month by Mr. Edmund D. Brooks of Minneapolis. Mr. 
Brooks's name is closely associated with that of Upson, 
as he was the publisher of half a dozen volumes of the 
brilliant young poet's work, including the two-volume 
Memorial Edition of which Dr. Burton was the editor. 
The Elegy will be issued in an edition of five hundred 
copies printed from type upon hand-made paper. 

Under the title of " A Modern Outlook : Studies of 
English and American Tendencies," Mr J. A. Hobson is 
about to publish, through an English house, a selection 
from the essays on society and literature which he has 
contributed to the London " Nation " during the past three 
years. The contents of the book fall under five head- 
ings: "Life and Letters," "The Woman of the Future," 
" American Traits," " The Church of the Future," and 
" Of Politics." It is to be hoped that these discerning 
and finely-written studies may find an American pub- 
lisher also. 

News of the death, on August 26, of William James, 
for over twenty years professor of psychology at 
Harvard University, reaches us just as we go to press. 
Professor James was called to London several months 
ago by the sickness of his brother, Mr. Henry James. 
A month ago he himself became ill, and upon his ar- 
rival in Quebec two weeks ago he was taken at once to 
his summer home at Chocorua, New Hampshire, where 
he died. More extended mention of Professor James's 
notable career and accomplishment will be given in our 
next issue.

THE PLAYERS OF LONDON 

By LOUISE BEECHER CHANCELLOR. 
Decorations and Drawings by Harry B. Matthews. 
Globe, Toronto, Can. : " ' The Players of London ' is distinctly worth 
reading. ' Will ' Shakespeare, as the central figure of an Elizabethan 
smart set is made a very human figure and the center of a love story 
that fills all requirements." 

Courier, Buffalo, N. Y. : " The infinite charm of this book is like that 
of the old classics, for it has the grace and the stately style of the 
golden days of Elizabeth. The famous men and women of the period 
are introduced with rare skill. It is a work characterized by a capti- 
vating realism. The coquettish and susceptible Queen is herself por- 
trayed with fine understanding."

THEODORE ROOSEVELTS 

African Game Trails 

THE AFRICAN WANDERINGS OF AN 
AMERICAN HUNTER -NATURALIST 

We quote above a statement that this is " The Book of the Year" We 
believe it true for many reasons; chiefly because, The writer of the book had 
all his heart in the writing of it, as these words of his show: 

" I regard this book as a serious thing. I have put my best into it." 

Because he was inspired by the tremendous romance of his subject. As 
these words of his show: 

" ' I speak of Africa and golden joys/ the joy of wandering through 
lonely lands; the joy of hunting the mighty and terrible lords of the 
wilderness, the cunning, the wary, and the grim." 

Because, as the New Tork Evening Sun finds, his book is: 

"One of the handsomest volumes, if not the handsomest volume, 
that ever came from the press of CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS. The 
page is most gratifying to the eye of the reader, and the closed book 
would be an ornament to any drawing-room table." 

Because, as the Philadelphia Ledger finds : 

" It reveals the author in an entirely new light to many who have 
lost sight of Roosevelt the naturalist in Roosevelt the statesman. It is 
filled with a vivid human interest, which would make it a remarkable 
literary achievement entirely apart from the personality of the author." 

Splendidly illustrated with photographs by Kermit> by 
the naturalists of the expedition, and eight drawings. 

The book is on sale at x^TM^ Price, 

all bookstores. /ifiii^ $4.00 net, postpaid $4.33.

Rest Harrow By MAURICE HEWLETT $i.so. 

A novel that stands complete and inde|M-iidi-iit of his other books, yet is built about those rem.irkahli- < li.u .> 
s.-nhoiise. the botanist, poet, and vagabond, the beautiful and magm-tic Xm< hia. and M.n\ Middl.-h.im - s,. widi-K 
known through his former books, " Halfway House" and " Open Country." In fact, '' Kest Harrow " coinpl.-ii-- tin- 
story that ran through these, and though it displays the same exquisite style and love of the open air. .md tin- s m,.- 
Krilliant power of description, yet the way in w Inch Mr. H. -\vl.-ri continues the sore and logical development of tin-si- 
characters is its inotrt extraordinary quality. Taken as a single independent story, it stands among the very few great 
novels of contemporary literature ; but taken in connection with " < >prn < '..nutty " ami " Halfway House," as sustain 
ing the distinct personalities of these characters and bringing tln-m to their full development, it become* a nni| 
masterpiece in construction and character study. 

There are many minor characters, and they are all endowed with the breath of life. Bill Chevenix is a dcli^littul 
-ml. one of the finest English gentlemen in recent fiction. Sanc-hia's father is a splendid old fellow, and In -r nn>i Int. 
her sisters, her brothers-in-law, Aunt Wenrnan, and all the others stand on their feet and walk in the semblance of 
life. " Rest Harrow " is bound to interest every one who cares for genuine literature. N, Y. World. 

Celt and Saxon e y GEORGE MEREDITH si. so. 

"It is more brilliant than "The Egoist* for a corresponding distance into its bulk. Its style is more elastic than 
that of ' Ird Ormont aud His Aminta.' In the early chapters there is two and tlir.-i- lin>- land*<-.ip>- paimim; thai 
starts the scene out of individual imagination ; no ' laboring with the drop-scene brush,' as Diana has it. 1'n-cisvly 
in chapter four Patrick takes a swim in I >ec<Miiber weather a paragraph to set young blood dancing. It U more real 
than actual midwinter swims of one's own. And tin- only man who could do this sort of thing is gone." Boston

Of " A Motley " The Dial said : " Pathos and humor, which fill a larger place in life than do hilarity and merriment; 
are the prevailing note of the book, which might perhaps best be briefly characterized as a book of tears and smili-s.' 
And the Baltimore Sun nays : " There are twenty-eight stories, studies, impressions mere literary flash-light* 
which have such a haunting vividness of intensity that they are unforgettable as scenes revealed by the glare <>f tin- 
lightning amid the thunder and torrent of a storm."

Some of the many things he talks about are "Divorce," "Glory," "A Bachelor's Tax ' 

Travel." " Work," " Drugs," " The Rising of the Subject Races," " Woman Suffrage," etc. 

The Old Virginia Gentleman And Other Sketches 

By Dr. GEORGE W. BAGBY With an Introduction by Thoma. Nel.on Pag,. SI. SO net 

Thomas Nelson Page says : " Poe was the master of the absolutely imaginative sketch or tale so purely imaginat i\ 
that to discover any local color by which to give it locality it is necessary to analyze the work for unintentional traces 
of his surroundings. George W. Bagby, on the other hand, was absolutely realistic so purely realist i< t hat m> mi.- 
can read, even at random, a page of his genre sketches and not recognize at once the truth of the picture and point t<> 
its original. He was not a factionist, but a realist . . . Among all Virginia's writers few have had the love to feel 
and the gift to portray the Virginia life as Bagby had." 

These sketches of Virginia life before the war are written with so much sentiment, in a style so simple, as to recall 
Ik Marvel ; at times their humor suggests Charles Lamb.

NEW BOOKS AND NEW EDITIONS 

FOR THE FALL OF 1910 

CLAYHANGER 

By ARNOLD BENNETT, Author of "The Old Wives' Tale." Large 12mo. 91.50 net. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett's new novel "Clayhanger" is the first of a trilogy of novels dealing with the Five Town*.' 
In "The Old Wives' Tale," Mr. Bennett described the old spirit of the central provinces of England, lu 
this trilogy he will describe the breaking down of the old spirit by the new. This first novel relates the history 
of Edwin Clayhanger from the time of his leaving school to his marriage at about the age of thirty-five. It 
begins in the past and ends only when, after many trials and much suspense, the new ideals have definitely taken 
the place of the old. 

Edwin's love-affair is extremely long and complicated, and he only succeeds in marrying Hilda I^essways 
after the most distressing experiences, not the least of which is the decay and death of his father and all that his 
father represents. In the matter of background to these personal histories, the author has tried to show, per- 
haps, more ambitiously than in "The Old Wives' Tales" that the sociological development of a vast community 
will furnish the finest romance and color that an artist can desire. 

The Flint Heart 

A Fairy Tale 

By EDEN PHILLPOTTS. With 16 full-page illustrations by CHARLES FOLKARD. 12 mo. 81.50. 
A fanciful, grotesque tale of the kind so dear to the heart of childhood, probably the most original fairy-tale that 
has appeared since the days of Andersen and Grimm. The entirely original plot is based on an old prehistoric 
charm that reappears in Dartmore to-day and wields its uncanny influence. The story is told with a grace and 
delicacy of treatment most unusual, and proves the story to be one of the author's playtime fancy, quitr in 
keeping with his reputation as a serious novelist. 

The Book of the Animal Kingdom 

Mammals 
By W. PKRCIVAL WESTELL, F.L.S., with 274 illustrations (14 in color) chiefly from photographs of the living 

animals, by W. S. Berridge, F.Z.S. 8vo, 34.00. 

Probably the most effective attempt to present a readable account of living and extinct mammals, which is also 
scientifically accurate and which preserves a just balance and proportion of interest in the various classes 
animals. An exceptional feature of the books are the illustrations, which faithfully keep the life appearance of 
the animals before the reader. 

Hiram Golf's Religion 

Or, " The Shoemaker by the Grace of God" 

By GEORGE H. HKPWORTH. A new holiday edition, with decorative borders and four illustrations in photogravure 

by D. C. HUTCHISON. 12rao, 81.25. 

Few characters in fiction have exercised a wider influence for good than the humble shoemaker of this story. 
His wholesome, practical views of religion, entirely free of sectarianism, are widely quoted, often by people who 
do not know their source. This new edition will be welcomed for its artistic form and attractive illustrations.

JUVENILES FOR 1910 

BOOKS OF ADVENTURE, FAIRY TALES, AND STORIED 

FOR YOUNGER READERS 



Fighting with Fremont 

A Tale of the Conquest of California 

By EVERETT MCNEIL. Illustrated. 12mo. 81.50. 
The story of how California was won for the Union and 
the part played in the winning by the hardy frontier 
heroes of '46. A tale of engrossing interest with a 
sound historical outline that will captivate and entertain 
its readers and leave them with a better knowledge of 
some of the men and many of the events that helped 
to form our nation's present greatness. 

Fairy Tales from Hans 
Andersen 

Translated by MRS. E. LUCAS. Fully Illustrated in 
color by MAXWELL ARMFIELD. 8vo. Decorative 
cloth. $3.00. 

Many editions of Andersen's works have been issued 
but the publishers can justly claim for this new edition, 
the most perfect series of illustrations ever prepared 
for this prince of story tellers. Maxwell Armtield is a 
new man in the illustrating field, but so wonderfully 
has he embodied the sense of the fairy realm in his 
work that even Mrs. Lucas's masterly translation will 
gain by the association of the many full-page colored 
plates with the stories. 



Captain Pete in Alaska 

By JAMES COOPER WHEELER. Illustrated. 

12mo. $1.50. 

A new tale in the adventures of the youthful hero of 
Fuget Sound, in which he turns his attention to Alaska 
and participates in the discovery of gold just before the 
Klondike rush. His secret expedition is tracked and 
attacked by Chinese Smugglers and a dashing series of 
exciting events follow rapidly on to the final success of 
the expedition. A splendid story of adventure in the 
most romantic corner of present-day America. 

The Adventures of Tommy 
Postoffice 

The True Story of a Cat 

By GABRIELLB E. JACKSON. Illustrated. 

12mo. $1.25. 

A true child's book. A delightful story of a little waif 
shipped from one of Uncle Sam's Post Offices to another 
in a mail bag. It tells of his prompt adoption by the 
mail clerks and of his subsequent adventures, mischiev- 
ous pranks, and smart ways, and finally how he played 
Cupid in a pretty little romance. 



Where the Wind Blows 

Being Ten Fairy-Tales From Ten Nations 

Re-told by KATHERINE PYLE. Illustrated in color and black-and-white by BERTHA C. DAY. 12mo. $2.00. 
Miss Pyle's pretty little conceit of the North Wind and his Grandam runs a little thread of unity through these 
stories and binds them together in the interest of the youthful reader. So simple is the form of narration, yet 
so artistically handled in the retelling, that the collection will be found to appeal to the youngest child who 
listens as well as the child who reads for itself. 

Captain Polly of Annapolis The Listen to Me Stories 



By GABRIELLE E. JACKSON. Illustrated. 

!*> $1 50 

A splendid story of school life for girls, one in which 

the patriotic element comes very prominently to the 
f , j L 1.1 a 

front in such a way as to attract and probably influence 

its young readers to a better understanding and appre- 
ciation of what " Old Glory " stands for.

The Heritage of the Desert 

A Big New Novel by ZANE GREY 

ONCE in a while there comes a book which raises the curtain upon a fresh and unknown

half savage, intense as the sunglow of the desert and as dramatic as the shadowy depths 
of the great canons. The hero, saved from the desert and from "rustlers" by kindly 
Mormons, and the heroine, a beautiful Mescal, are disclosed in an atmosphere fragrant of 
mountain forests. In a series of swift, tense scenes the drama of the wilderness is fought to a 
thrilling close. with Frontispiece. Post 8vj. Cloth, j i . 50.

r PH!S is another of Dr. Jefferson's delightful little booklets, 
* keyed to the thought of the holiday season and yet equally 
suited to other seasons of the year, and especially to those times 
and moods when one feels the stirring of new hopes and am- 
bitions. The ruling idea of this book is that it is possible to 
live in an old world, and go through substantially the same old 
experiences, day by day, and yet find ourselves constantly in a 
new world.

T T so happens that in this year 1910, when a new tide of foreign 
* missionary interest is flooding America, the oldest foreign 
missionary society of the land, the American Board of Com- 
missioners for Foreign Missions, celebrates its centenary. 
There is therefore a double timeliness to this volume written 
by the Board's Editorial Secretary, in which the history of its 
first hundred years is briefly told.

ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL BOOKS 189 

(A classified list of the new books planned for pub- 
lication during the coming Fall and Winter season.) 



BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON. 

The season of hammock and deck-chair read- 
ing is at an end, and the shortening days remind 
us that for six months or more we shall scan 
the pages of whatever books we read in the light 
of the lamp or the electric globe, and no longer 
in the liberal light of nature reflected from 
azure skies. It is assumed, perhaps rashly, 
that this change of conditions gives to our 
thought a more serious cast, and that we demand 
a more nutritious sustenance than has seemed 
adequate for the idle summer days. Certainly, 
the plans of publishers are founded upon this 
assumption, for, to change the metaphor, they 
reserve their heavy artillery for the fall and 
winter season, bombarding us with the shot and 
shell of history and philosophy and criticism, and 
putting aside the popguns that have been dis- 
charging their pellets of "light reading" all sum- 
mer long. They, at least, will not fail us, and if 
we prove recreant to the cultural opportunities 
they offer, we have only ourselves to blame. 

In the extensive classified list of forthcoming 
books that constitutes a feature of our present 
issue, the biographical section is by far the 
richest in alluring announcements. No sort of 
book is more satisfying to the cultivated sense 
than a good biography the story of a man's 
life provided it be told with insight and 
sympathy, making large use of his own forms of 
expression, and provided also that it be a life of 
rich associations and significant activities. 
Judged by these tests, we should say that no 
other book in our list held out greater promise 
of enjoyment than the "Life and Letters of 
Edmund Clarence Stedman," as prepared by 
Miss Laura Stedman, the poet's granddaughter. 
It is nearly three years since Mr. Stedman died, 
and the record of his life has been made up 
with ample time for deliberation and the collec- 
tion of material. It is to consist largely of his 
letters, and he was one of the best of letter- 
writers, giving of himself freely to his friends, 
and not keeping all the good things for his 
books. No man was more closely in touch than 
he was for over half a century with all that was 
best in American life and thought, and his 
flashing intellect illuminated every theme toward 
which it was directed. Miss Stedman, who is 
his only surviving descendant, was the constant

companion and helper of his later years, and 
may be trusted to deal with his career in a spirit 
of delicate and tender appreciation. She says 
of her book and its subject : " So wonderful is 
his personality even after death that I do not seem 
to have written it myself. I constantly have 
had the feeling that he was directing what I 
should say and what I should not say, even 
sometimes contrary to my planning." The work 
will be in two large volumes, with illustrations. 

Three or four other volumes of a biogra- 
phical (or rather autobiographical) character 
stand out prominently in the season's announce- 
ments. The " Reminiscences " of Goldwin 
Smith are sure to have the deepest interest, and 
we understand that they cover practically the 
whole course of the veteran historian's life. They 
are edited by his private secretary, Mr. Arnold 
Haultain. Of a very different and more romantic 
kind of interest will be the " Memories and 
Impressions" of Madame Helena Modjeska, 
with their story of theatrical life in two worlds, 
of ranching-days in California, and of asso- 
ciations with the leading spirits of her time. 
Still another genre of autobiography will be 
provided by " The Digressions of V.," in which 
Mr. Elihu Vedder takes the world into his 
confidence, and reveals his own engaging tem- 
perament. Of more special interest, but hardly 
less absorbing, will be the " Twenty Years at 
Hull House," as chronicled by Miss Jane 
Addams. Other noteworthy books in the cate- 
gory now under consideration will be the " Life 
and Letters of William Sharp," edited by his 
widow ; the new biography of John Brown, by 
Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard ; " Grover Cleve- 
land: A Record of Friendship," by Richard 
Watson Gilder; "The Life of Tolstoy," by 
Mr. Aylmer Maude, the best-known English 
disciple of the Russian moralist ; and Professor 
Brander Matthews's biography of Moliere, which 
will doubtless be a worthy companion to Mr. 
Chatfield-Taylor's treatment of the same subject. 

The historical list seems rather less interest- 
ing than usual. We note among the more 
important titles, Admiral Chadwick's history 
of " The Spanish- American War " ; Lord 
Acton's " Lectures on the French Revolution" ; 
" The Wilderness Trail," by Mr. Charles A. 
Hun na ; " The Incas of Peru," by Sir Clements 
Markham ; a translation in four volumes of 
M. A ill anl's history of the French Revolution; 
General Morris Schaff's "The Battle of the 
Wilderness " ; " The Influence of Wealth in 
Imperial Rome," by Mr. William Stearns 
Davis ; and the final volume of that largely- 



planned work, the "Cambridge Modern His- 
tory." These seem to be all the titles that 
call for special mention, although we make no 
doubt that numerous other works of like iin 
portance will turn up before the season is over. 

The department of literary history and criti- 
cism offers much that is of interest. There will 
be a new volume of essays by that charming 
writer Mr. S. M. Crothers, and new volumes by 
such writers of distinctive excellence as Mr. 
Charles Francis Adams, Mr. A. C. Benson, Mr. 
G. K. Chesterton, Mr. Adrian H. Joline, Mr. 
E. V. Lucas, and Mr. W. D. Howells. M n. 
Emily James Putnam has collected into a 
volume her magazine papers on " The Lady of 
Different Times and Nations," the Japanese 
Letters of Lafcadio Hearn have been edited for 
publication by Miss Elizabeth Bisland, and a 
volume entitled " Mazzini, and Other Essays " 
has been put together from the papers left by 
Henry D. Lloyd. Mr. Montrose J. Moses has 
a work on " The Literature of the South," Pro- 
fessor Oscar Kuhns a volume on " The Love of 
Books and Reading," and Mr. Frank Harris a 
volume on " The Women of Shakespeare." 
Colonel Roosevelt's "African and European 
Addresses " may perhaps be mentioned here, and 
readers who like that sort of thing may also 
revel in a collection of " dynamic utterances on 
various subjects " to be entitled " The Real 
Roosevelt." 

The recent growth of interest in the drama 
as literature is attested by the promise of an 
unusual number of plays in book form, Herr 
Sudermann's three " Morituri " are to appear 
in English, as are also M. Maeterlinck's " Mary 
Magdalene," M. Rostand's " Chantecler," and 
Mr. Andr&ev's " Anathema." English and 
American play-writing are to be represented by 
Mr. John Galsworthy's " Justice," Mr. Rudolph 
Besier's " Don," Mr. Edward Sheldon's " The 
Nigger," and Mr. John Masefield's "The 
Tragedy of Nan, and Other Plays." The allied 
category of poetry is marked by new volumes 
from the pens of Mr. Edward Arlington Robin- 
son, Mr. Stephen Phillips, Mrs. Helen Hay 
Whitney, Mr. Samuel Minturn Peck, and the 
late Father Tabb. We note also with much 
satisfaction that Professor Curtis Hidden Page's 
long-awaited "Golden Treasury of American 
Songs and Lyrics " is at last actually announced 
for publication. 

Of forthcoming fiction, the books most 
eagerly awaited are probably Mr. Arnold Ben- 
nett's " Clayhanger," Mr. William De Morgan"^ 
" An Affair of Dishonour JlMiss May Sinclair^

" The Creators," Mr. H. G. Wells's " The New

" Harmen Pols " by " Maarten Maartens," Mr. 
Meredith Nicholson's "The Siege of the 
Seven Suitors," Mr. Robert W. Chambers's 
" Ailsa Paige," and Mrs. Katherine Cecil 
Thurston's " Max." Such a list as this should 
suffice to whet most kinds of novel-readers' 
appetites. 

FICTION AND FACT. 

Paraphrasing Browning, we might with cheerful 
confidence declare that all good things are ours, nor 
fact helps fiction more than this helps fact. Indeed, 
we might go further and find it not so very hard to 
defend the thesis that fact is based on fiction rather 
than fiction on fact. At least they are greatly in- 
debted to each other, and are so closely inter-related 
and interwoven that one can seldom or never deter- 
mine just where lies the boundary line separating 
the unadorned plainness of fact from the elaborate 
embroidery of fiction. 

What we call fact or reality is not so much a 
matter of passive perception as of active experience. 
It is man's moulding and shaping imagination, 
his color-imparting fancy, his pronenesa to see in 
a certain light and from a certain angle rather 
than otherwise, that make the world what it is to 
him. It has been said, not necessarily in any spirit 
of irreverence or even of paradox, that the noblest 
work of man is God, or, to make the parody on Pope 
complete, "an honest God's the noblest work of 
man." Next to that, his most wonderful and awe- 
inspiring creation is the universe which he inhabits, 
and with the fashioning of which and the deciding 
what objects in it shall be objects of admiration and 
desire, what of scorn and abhorrence, what shall 
partake of permanence and meaning, what of tran- 
siency and insignificance, what shall be deemed 
beautiful and what accounted ugly, man collectively 
and cumulatively has had so much to do. Because 
we are actors far more than we are spectators, be- 
cause we bring to the interpretation and enjoyment 
of life so much more than is brought to us by our 
bare existence and by things-in-themselves (if there 
be any such), we are justified in maintaining the 
primary importance of that creative imagination 
which the fiction-maker possesses in so high a de- 
gree. The very etymology of the word " fiction " 
(from fingere, to shape or fashion) emphasizes this 
power of the romancer to make his facts assume 
such form as he chooses. The aspect and meaning 
he gives them they are never thereafter able wholly 
to throw off. Mary Queen of Scots owes her beauty 
and charm, so far as we are concerned, much more 
to the author of " The Abbot " than to her bodily 
progenitors ; and the Brocken takes its weirdly ro- 
mantic character from the pen of Goethe and Heine 
and countless others, rather than from its geolog- 
ical formation or physical aspect. 



What person of mature years, and mature mind, 
but can recall the sudden sense of freedom and power 
with which he recognized, all in a flash it may have 
been, his right and privilege to interpret the so-called 
facts of existence for himself? Excepting the fun- 
damentals of ethics, there is indeed nothing either 
good or bad, but thinking makes it so. Within the 
bounds of morality, and without disregarding the 
categorical imperative, one can always refuse, if one 
thinks best, to accept the conventional meaning or 
importance of any act or event or association; and 
then, if one is a master in the literary representa- 
tion of his ideals and convictions, whether through 
the medium of prose fiction or of poetry or of drama, 
much can be done toward the establishment of new 
conventions and the perpetuation of new meanings, 
which of course must stand their chance in turn of 
being disallowed and overthrown. 

Whether there would be anything left to us of 
what we call life and reality if the element of fiction, 
or imagination, or romance, were removed, is doubt- 
less too whimsical a query to merit serious consid- 
eration; but certain it is that we get from that 
element constant and repeated affirmations of our 
own personal experiences, and a sense of our own 
reality and the worth-whileness of things, that come 
to us from no other source. "Identity of experi- 
ence," according to Professor Mtinsterberg in his 
recent philosophical work on " The Eternal Values," 
is what we all crave in order to convince ourselves 
of a something more permanent than the flashlike 
passing impression, of an individuality in us more 
stable than the "stream of consciousness" with 
which psychology concerns itself. It is these re- 
current and ever-welcome discoveries in literature 
of such identity of experience, proving that the 
most personal thing is often if not always the most 
universal thing, that give undying fascination to the 
novel or the poem or the play. The great writers 
stand to us in the position of parents or other beloved 
adults to children, whose little daily experiences lack 
the touch of actuality and meaning without the ap- 
proving or sympathizing nod of an older person. 
Just as the cake loses something of its sweetness 
and the tart something of its flavor to the infant 
condemned to eat these dainties in solitude, BO our 
loves and hates and enthusiasms would be robbed of 
their zest without the imaginative associations that 
cluster around them, and that we owe so largely, 
even though it may be indirectly, to literature. 

" I am never quite sure of life unless I find litera- 
ture in it," frankly confesses. Mr. Howells in his 
preface to "Literature and Life." He continues: 
"Unless the thing seen reveals to me an intrinsic 
poetry, and puts on phrases that clothe it pleasingly 
to the imagination, I do not much care for it; but 
if it will do this, I do not mind how poor or com- 
mon or squalid it shows at first glance : it challenges 
my curiosity and keeps my sympathy." Another 
passage from another of the same author's books 
shows how much more real than so-called reality the 
figments of poetic fancy can become to a sympa-

the book," he says, " night and day, indoors and 
out, to myself and to whomever I could make listen. 
I have no words to tell the rapture it was to me; 
but I hope that in some more articulate being, if it 
should ever be my unmerited fortune to meet th.nt 
tommo potto, face to face, it shall somehow be 
uttered from me to him, and he will understand how 
completely he became the life of the boy I was then." 

The creative imagination and interpretative skill 
of the artist in words often succeed in transfiguring 
for us what had before seemed ugly and valueless, 
much as the genius of the artist Whistler first made 
interesting and beautiful the shipping and dockyards 
and murky atmosphere of the Thames in the neigh- 
borhood of Chelsea. Such books as " Children of 
the Ghetto," " Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch," 
Little Aliens," and many other modern works of 
fiction that deal lovingly and understandingly with 
what most of us had thought only squalid and depres- 
sing, enlarge the reader's sympathies and open up 
for him unsuspected mines of wealth in unlikely 
regions. One is reminded of what Emerson says, 
that "the poet, who re-attaches things to nature and 
the whole, re-attaching even artificial things and 
violations of nature, to nature, by a deeper insight, 
disposes very easily of the most disagreeable facts. 
Readers of poetry see the factory-village and 
the railway, and fancy that the poetry of the land- 
scape is broken up by these; for these works of art 
are not yet consecrated in their reading; but the 
poet sees them fall within the great Order not less 
than the beehive, or the spider's geometrical web. 
Nature adopts them very fast into her vital circles, 
and the gliding train of cars she loves like her own." 
How different the attitude of Ruskin toward the 
hated iron road and its smoke-belching monsters of 
noisy locomotion! 

To the fashioners and the makers, the fiction- 
writers and the poets, the world owes more than it 
is wont to acknowledge for rescue from the perils 
of dead convention and of complacent satisfaction 
with the existing order. Important changes and 
reforms have a way of getting themselves effected 
more easily and quickly when no professional re- 
former or agitator appears on the stage to arouse and 
concentrate the bitter opposition of "vested inter- 
ests." What the pen of jaunty ridicule and humor- 
ous fancy and creative insight has done in pointing 
the better way and gently but irresistibly turning 
reluctant footsteps into it, can never be told. And 
so it is, as was intimated at the outset, that we, as 
inhabitants of a world partly given to us and partly 
created by us, are unprepared to say that we owe 
more to fact than to fiction, even were it possible to 
tell where the one ends and the other begins ; but 
for the beautifying and spiritualizing and ennobling 
of life we must hold ourselves vastly more indebted 
to the vitalizing imagination than to the dead ma- 
terial on which it works. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 

A POPDLARIZER OF PSYCHOLOGY, and to a scare. 1 \ 
less extent of its more abstruse sister, philosophy. 
Dr. William James leaves thousands of former 
pupils to mourn his death, and probably even more 
devoted readers to regret that the last of his fasci- 
nating studies of the deeper problems of life and 
mind has now been given to the world. Born in 
New York in 1842, son of the Rev. Henry James, 
a Swedenborgian minister, he came honestly by his 
more lately developed interest in religion as a force 
powerful for good in the uplift of the individual and 
the race. In his " Varieties of Religious Experi- 
ence " are to be found his well-considered opinions 
on this theme. " The Will to Believe " is a work 
of kindred nature, and is also of peculiar interest 
as first revealing the author's leanings toward that 
habit of philosophic thought which he later made 
famous under the name he chose to give to it, 
Pragmatism. His two books on this subject, espe- 
cially the earlier one, which had already been made 
public in the form of Lowell Institute lectures, are 
among the most characteristic of his writings. His 
literary style, whether he was dealing with the ele- 
ments of psychology, the sublimities of religious 
faith, the results of psychic research, the perform- 
ances of Madame Palladino, or "The Moral Equi- 
valent of War" (his latest and in some respect* 
most admirable piece of work), was an unfailing 
joy to the appreciative reader. For lucidity and 
dexterity and picturesqueness in the presentation of 
rather abstruse matter in philosophy and religion, 
he had no equal. 

THR STOKY OF A POST-PRANDIAL BLUNDER, as 

told both by the blunderer himself and by the toast- 
master of the occasion, may now be read in full, in 
the opening pages of "Mark Twain's Speeches," 
which was briefly reviewed in our last issue, and in 
the September "Harper's Magazine," where Mr. 
Howells continues his reminiscences of his friend 
the humorist. The dinner in question was one of 
those Boston banquets attended by the aristocracy 
of culture that was making the then still youthful 
"Atlantic Monthly" famous for its sustained high 
standard of literary excellence. Emerson and 
Longfellow and Holmes were among the distin- 
guished guests present were, in fact, the most 
distinguished ; and these three idols of their age in 
cultured New England our specially invited humor- 
ist conceived it would be amusing and not indeco- 
rous to make the subjects of a burlesque in which 
wit and fancy joined in that unrestrained horse- 
play of which Mark Twain, especially the earlier 
Mark Twain, was so eminently a master. " When 
I came to Clemens," relates the unhappy toastmas- 
ter, " I introduced him with the cordial admiring 
I had for him as one of my greatest routri I tutors 
and dearest friends. Here, I said, in sum, was a 
humorist who never left you hanging your hea*l for 
having enjoyed his joke:. and then the. .a.maz!ng

mistake, the bewildering blunder, the cruel catas- 
trophe was upon us." And now not the least 
amazing part of it all is that the blunderer himself 
should have resuscitated that lamentable perform- 
ance and put it at the head of his published speeches, 
adding at the same time an editorial note of frank 
admiration for its cleverness and a confession of 
inability to see in it any vulgarity or even impro- 
priety- . . . 

THE RIPENING OF A NOVELIST is described with 
much interesting detail by Mr. A. St. John Adcock 
in his illustrated account of the author of " Alice- 
for-Short," in the London " Bookman " for August. 
Since there is some truth in Mr. Adcock's assertion 
that " a bewildering lot of nonsensical inaccuracy 
has been published about Mr. William de Morgan, 
especially in America," a few plain statements of 
fact may be not out of place here. Mr. de Morgan 
was born in London in 1839, being the eldest son 
of Augustus de Morgan, the famous mathematician, 
author of the ever-readable " Budget of Paradoxes," 
friend of James Martineau, and fellow-professor 
with him at University College. From his mother, 
Sophia Elizabeth Frend, as well as from his father, 
the son William inherited intellect and imagination, 
together with literary aptitudes. Artistic tastes 
and abilities he has also displayed, as possessors of 
his highly esteemed pottery are aware, and as may 
be gathered from his having illustrated one of his 
sister's books of fairy tales. How he came to turn 
his hand from the potter's wheel to fiction, at the 
age of sixty-seven, and his immediate success as a 
novelist, need not here be told again, nor need we 
more than refer to his fondness for Dickens, which 
has left its mark on his pages. This and other 
qualities of his style will be enjoyed anew in his 
latest book, " An Affair of Dishonor," which is now 

fresh from the press. 



A ROLAND FOR MR. LANG'S OLIVER is what one 
is tempted to essay on reading his recent amusing 
and unfortunately too well deserved criticism of the 
imperfect familiarity with English nobility displayed 
by our novelists, or at least by one of them. "I 
find," writes Mr. Lang, " in a roman policier, ( A 
Sealed Verdict,' an English assassin who says, 'I am 
the third or younger ' (youngest ?) ' son of the late 
Sir James Allonby, sixth Earl of Menton.' If the 
late Earl did happen to possess a baronetcy, his son 
would never think of mentioning the circumstance. 
The man's father and two elder brothers have died, 
he says, so he is Lord Menton, but the amateur 
detective of the tale calls him 'Lord Allonby,' and 
he, though a very bad man, is too polite to correct 
the absurd error. 'I charge you with the murder 
of your wife, Laura, Lady Allonby.' He could 
easily have escaped, on these terms, as there was 
no Lady Allonby to be murdered! . . . Before 
coming into the earldom, this variegated miscreant, 
son of the Earl, was ' Sir Cyrus D. Anvers Allonby.' 
Did he catch the baronetcy, like measles, from his 
living father? . . . Next, he becomes, after his 



decease, 'Lord Cyrus Allonby.' C'est un comble! 
And that is not all. Lord Menton is finally 
described as ' Sir Cyrus D. Anvers Allonby,' and 
as such is he buried." This is rather hard on Mr. 
Lawrence L. Lynch, the author of the book, and 
we do not see how we can very well soften it, unless 
by indulging in a little " back talk." The English 
novelist, Mr. Max Pemberton, in his highly enter- 
taining book, " A Daughter of the States," makes 
his heroine say : " Is there any Venezuelan ship 
that would harm a subject of the United States?" 
What free-born Yankee, outside of an English novel, 
would ever speak or even think of subjects of the 
United States ? Mr. Lang, himself, in his " Dis- 
entanglers" causes one of his characters, an 
English-bred American girl, after a diligent study 
of American humorists, to utter the following as 
idiomatic : " Your Tennyson has the inner tracks 
of our Longfellow ; your Thackeray gives our 
Bertha Runkle his dust." Truly, it is given to 
few to know well more than one country and one 
dialect. . 

A NEW CLAIM FOR ESPERANTO, put forward by 
the committee of physicians at the late Esperanto 
Congress in Washington, is of passing interest, 
though the lay public will doubtless refuse to go all 
the way with these Esperantist doctors. The latter 
maintain that the promulgation of important medi- 
cal discoveries is now delayed for several years 
because of the slowness of translations in making 
their appearance. In the olden time Latin was the 
universal language of the learned world, but its 
obsolescence now renders necessary a modern sub- 
stitute, such as Esperanto, which will, it is hoped, 
serve to acquaint all nations promptly with the most 
recent developments in medical science. These 
developments, however, seem to take the form of 
discoveries of new diseases oftener than of cures for 
existing maladies ; and of new and fashionable dis- 
tempers we already have quite enough. Also, might 
not the same amount of energy that is now scatter- 
ingly bestowed on the rival world-languages be pro- 
ductive of larger results if concentrated upon some 
already widely-used tongue, such as French or 
English or German? ... 

THE PORTRAIT OF A RESOURCEFUL AND SUCCESS- 
FUL PUBLISHER is drawn with both pen and pencil 
or pen and camera in the September "American 
Magazine." The subject of the sketch is Mr. Charles 
Scribner, the present Charles, whose latest triumph- 
ant exploit in drawing into his net the prize author 
of the day, the lion-hunter of Sagamore Hill, has 
excited the most widespread interest. The closing 
sentences of the eulogistic account of his work and 
his character may not be out of place here. Patient 
and courteous he is in a high degree, though "he 
has doubtless had many experiences with business 
rivals as well as business associates which have tried 
his temper; the publishing business is enough to 
try anybody's temper. Of strong convictions, and 
vigorous ideas, it may be said that he is slow to

wrath, yet slow in no other process of his mind. He 
is eminently a just man, and punctiliously careful 
of other people's rights. . . . He was for years the 
President of the Publishers Association, and is now 
its Vice President, a director in several important 
banks, and a familiar figure in various social 
organizations." 

A DICTIONARY THAT IS CO8TINO A FORTUNE, 

comparable with that so generously spent by the 
late George Smith in creating the ' Dictionary of 
National Biography," has now at last come within 
measurable distance of its end. The " New Oxford 
Dictionary," first undertaken by the Philological 
Society, but soon afterward taken charge of, in a 
finely disinterested spirit of scholarship, by the 
Oxford University Press, will ultimately have cost 
its printers more than a quarter-million of pounds 
sterling. Sir James Murray, the chief editor, has 
won his knighthood by his scholarly devotion to the 
great Dictionary, and other noted names associated 
with the work are those of the late Dr. Furnivall, 
of Dr. Bradley, and Dr. Craigie. By a wise division 
of labor among these and other competent scholars 
the vast work has been pushed to its present 
advanced stage. By the time the last volume 
appears, however, our rapidly growing language 
will have developed ample material for a substantial 
supplement. For lexicographers, no less than for 
the wicked, there is no rest 



THE HISTORICAL EXHIBITION AT THE JERSEY 

CITY PUBLIC LIBRARY in connection with the 
Hudson-Fulton celebration hist year was of so un- 
usual interest, and so successful in every way that 
it was decided to issue an illustrated and briefly 
descriptive catalogue of the many family heirlooms 
and other noteworthy articles loaned for the occa- 
sion. In a thirty-eight-page pamphlet Miss Esther 
. Burdick, the librarian, has drawn up a careful 
list of these relics of a day that is dead. The accom- 
panying pictures, especially that of "a colonial 
interior" (an old-time bedroom, with canopied four- 
poster, antique cradle, spinning-wheel, and other 
quaint reminders of the past) are attractive. But 
will not this seem to some rather strange business 
for a library to be engaging in this usurping of 
the functions of the museum? How does it strike 
the librarian of the neighboring city of Newark, 
who has lately made some very sensible remarks on 
the proper and the improper functions of the public 
library ? 

AN ADVERTISING MYSTERY that may have puzzled 
others besides the present writer presents itself in 
the manifest reluctance of publishers to advertise 
their wares in the month of August, when more 
light literature, especially fiction, is read than at any 
other season of the year. The manager of the 
largest book-distributing agency in England has 
asserted that of all the months in the year August 
is the one when novels are most in demand ; but as 
surely as that month comes around publishers' 



advertiseraents,with few exceptions, are discontinued. 
I could name a book now," writes Mr. Charles 
Marriott to the Boston "Transcript," "well advertised 
up to the end of July, that only needs the word in 
season to turn a moderate success into a remark a Me 
one. With the opening of the autumn season it will 
be too late. The book . . . will be swamped in tin- 
tide of new arrivals. I firmly believe that one 
advertisement in August, the holiday month, is 
worth ten at any other time of the year." A word 
to the wise. To be sure, August has just departed. 
but other Augusts are coming. 



THE PROPOSED DICKENS TESTIMONIAL STAMP, 
representing a tardy royalty of one penny, and to 
be sold for the benefit of his descendants, some of 
whom are needy, would usefully and fittingly re- 
mind his many readers that such a man as Charles 
Dickens was born nearly one hundred years ago. It 
is hoped to have these stamps printed and on sale 
at all bookshops when the centenary year comes 
around. Three of Dickens's children and seventeen 
grandchildren are said to be now alive, and only 
three of the twenty are on the pension roll. If all 
owners of the twenty-four million copies of his 
works estimated as in existence should become 
stamp-purchasers, affixing one stamp to each vol- 
ume from the novelist's pen, a handsome perhaps 
too handsome testimonial could be handed to the 
less prosperous and more deserving of the Dickens 
family. But there is no probability of any such 
result. . . . 

A CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE IN FICTION, to 

which we have already directed attention, has for 
six years been producing itself from the untiring 
pen of M. Romain Holland, who has just accom- 
plished the ninth instalment or volume of his popular 
" Jean Christophe." So dear to the Gallic heart is 
this musically talented and otherwise interesting 
hero that the reading public will by no means con- 
sent to his death, or even to his honorable retirement 
to the enjoyment of a peaceful and uneventful old 
age. And so Jean Christophe bids fair to rival our 
own Elsie Dinsmore in the number of volumes 
chronicling his progress from the cradle to the grave. 
An authorized translation of the first four books is 
about to appear in this country. 


THE CENTENARY OF MRS. GASKELL falls Oil the 

twenty-ninth of this month, and should not be 
passed unnoted. " Cranford " and in lesser degree 
" Mary Barton " still have their admiring readers, 
though the author is far less powerfully imaginative 
than her friend Charlotte Bronte, and even in quiet 
realism is never rated with the incomparable Miss 
Austen. But she did produce one piece of work 
that grips the reader with a sense of unmistakable 
and, in passages, tragic reality, her biography of 
Charlotte Bronte. If ever living word fell from 
writer's pen, such may be found in that remarkable 
life of a remarkable woman.

MR. ROOSEVELT'S JUXGLE BOOK.* 



Little short of superfluous would be any 
formal review of Colonel Roosevelt's "African 
Game Trails," after the considerable portions 
of it that have appeared serially and received 
wide reading and much discussion, and after 
the daily newspaper chronicle and comment 
during the year of the distinguished hunter's 
wanderings in the Dark Continent. All the 
world knows about his leaving America on the 
23d -of March, 1909, for Naples, whence he 
proceeded to Mombosa, in East Africa, where, 
on the day after landing, he and his party 
boarded a railway train for " the most interest- 
ing journey in the world," through a vast zoolog- 
ical garden and out to the Kapiti Plains. There 
the safari awaited the hunters " safari " 
being the native term to denote " both the 
caravan with which one makes an expedition, 
and the expedition itself." Proceeding slowly 
in a generally northwestern direction, with a 
number of side trips for hunting purposes, and 
crossing the Victoria Nyanza Lake, the party 
reached Gondokoro toward the end of February, 
and, after a few days of further hunting, started 
down the Nile to Khartoum, where the finish- 
ing touches were put to the narrative of the 
" great adventure," and the last sheet of manu- 
script was despatched to the printer, March 15, 
1910, as planned a year before. 

All this of course makes a big book (of more 
than five hundred large pages), and it is one 
that fairly throbs with vigor and glows with 
enthusiasm and is tense with the strenuousness 
of physical exertion. Perils and hardships were 
not lacking to try the mettle and the endurance 
of the hunter-naturalists ; but with an attendant 
train of two hundred or more servants of various 
kinds, and with all necessary supplies (includ- 
ing a travelling library) in abundance, the rigors 
of the wilderness journey must have been very 
perceptibly and agreeably softened. On an early 
page attention is called to the fact that this was 
noamere huntsman's holiday, however it may 
have been regarded by the onlooking world at 
large, but " a scientific expedition sent out by 
the Smithsonian, to collect birds, mammals, 
reptiles, and plants, but especially specimens of 

* AFRICAN GAME TRAILS. An Account of the African 
Wanderings of an American Hunter-Naturalist. By Theodore 
Roosevelt. With illustrations from photographs by Kermit 
Roosevelt and other members of the expedition, and from

Scribner's Sons. 



big game, for the National Museum at Wash- 
ington." Of this seriously purposeful expedition 
Mr. Roosevelt was the commander, and he 
wishes to impress upon the reader that no un- 
necessary killing of animals was indulged in. 
The interests of the National Museum had to 
be kept in mind, and the expedition had to have 
its supplies of fresh meat ; but after that the 
denizens of the jungle, the antelope and buffalo 
of the plain, the birds of the air, and all the rest 
of the marvellously varied East African fauna, 
were at liberty to go their way unmolested. 
Thus at least we are repeatedly assured. 

Nevertheless the author's final " list of game 
shot with the rifle during the trip " assumes 
proportions that scarcely harmonize with these 
assurances. By Mr. Roosevelt and his son 
Kermit alone there were bagged seventeen lions, 
eleven elephants, twenty rhinos (to abbreviate 
an otherwise unpluralizable noun), eight hippos, 
nineteen zebras, fifty-three hartebeests, and so 
on to a " grand total " of five hundred and 
twelve animals, birds, and reptiles ; which can- 
not but excite our wonder at the large demands 
of the Museum and of the appetites of the 
hunter-naturalists. To suspect the latter of 
having indulged in any wanton shooting of 
unoffending beasts would be to question the 
sincerity of the author in his solemn assurances 
that no such barbarity was allowed. " Game 
butchering," he declares, "is as objectionable 
as any other form of wanton cruelty or barbarity, 
but to protest against all hunting of game is a 
sign of softness of head, and not soundness of 
heart." Just how much extinction of animal 
life is unavoidable in man's appointed task of 
replenishing the earth and subduing it must 
always remain a more or less open question ; 
but it would be difficult to maintain that Mr. 
Roosevelt's progress (significantly traced with 
a red line on the map in the book) through 
British East Africa was indispensable to the 
promotion of science or to the advance of civili- 
zation. Remarkably versed in natural history 
though he undoubtedly is, and important though 
his contributions to the National Museum's col- 
lection will justly be regarded, the whole excur- 
sion from start to finish was a grand holiday 
outing in which our exuberantly vigorous 
ex-President had a " bully time," and freely 
allowed himself something of the aboriginal 
savage's fierce joy in killing brute beasts. So 
why attempt to disguise the truth ? 

Instances may readily occur in which to pro- 
test against the taking of animal life would be 
a sign of soft-headedness, but in no conceivable 



174 



THE DIAL 



[Sept. 16, 



instance would the taking of such life be a 
necessary mark of the highest manhood ; more 
often than not it would be likely to serve as 
evidence of the blunting or the non-existence of 
the finer sensibilities. Many a man, unsus- 
pected of any softness of head, and conspicu- 
ously gifted with soundness of heart, has kept 
to the end an unconquerable shrinking from 
the infliction of suffering or death upon even the 
lowest forms of animate existence. To such it 
would have been impossible either to engage in 
or to describe in abhorrent detail any event 
like the following from Mr. Roosevelt's pen. 
It has to do with a buffalo hunt in which a 
number of the animals had been hit without 
being disabled : 

We now turned our attention to the wounded cow, 
which was close to the papyrus. She went down to our 
shots, but the reeds and marsh-grass were above our 
heads when we drew close to the swamp. Once again 
Heatley went in with his white horse, as close as it was 
even reasonably safe, with the hope either of seeing the 
cow, or of getting her to charge him and give us a fair 
chance at her. But nothing happened and we loosed 
the two dogs. They took up the trail and went some 
little distance into the papyrus, where we heard them 
give tongue, and immediately afterward there came the 
angry grunt of the wounded buffalo. It had risen and 
gone off thirty yards into the papyrus, although mortally 
wounded the frothy blood from the lungs was actually 
coming out of my first bullet hole. Its anger now made 
it foolish, and it followed the dogs to the edge of the 
papyrus. Here we caught a glimpse of it. Down it 
went to our shots, and in a minute we heard the moan- 
ing bellow which a wounded buffalo often gives before 
dying. Immediately afterward we could hear the dogs 
worrying it, while it bellowed again. 

More pleasing to contemplate is the author's 
kindly treatment of a much smaller and weaker 
bit of game, " a wee hedgehog, with much white 
about it," which would cuddle up in his hand, 
snuffing busily with his funny little nose. " We 
did not have the heart," he confesses, " to turn 
the tame, friendly little fellow over to the na- 
turalists, and so we let him go." The bagging 
of his first full-grown male lion was naturally 
an important event to Mr. Roosevelt, and he 
describes it in a characteristic passage. Equally 
in his unmistakable style, and recording a dis- 
play of cool courage worthy of a better cause, is 
his account of the dexterous despatch of another 
powerful lion that charged him with decidedly 
hostile intent. 

" I was sighting carefully, from my knee, and I knew 
I had the lion all right; for though he galloped at a 
great pace, he came on steadily ears laid back and 
uttering terrific coughing grunts and there was now 
no question of making allowance for distance, nor, as 
he was out in the open, for the fact that he had not 
before been distinctly visible. The bead of my fore- 



sight was exactly on the centre of his chest as I pressed 
the trigger, and the bullet went as true as if the place 
had been plotted with dividers. The blow brought 
him up all standing, and he fell forward on his head." 

Of more varied and less sanguinary interest 
than these successive shootings of sundry sorts 
of big game are the first and last parts of the 
book, describing the author's memorable journey 
on the cow-catcher, or lion-catcher, of a loco- 
motive as the train sped through the Pleisto- 
cene," his experiences on an East-African 
ranch, and his voyage down the Nile. As illus- 
trating Mr. Roosevelt's more studied style let 
us quote the closing sentences of his preface : 

The hunter who wanders through these lands sees 
sights which ever afterward remain fixed in his mind. 
He sees the monstrous river-horse snorting and plung- 
ing beside the boat; the giraffe looking over the tree 
tops at the nearing horseman; the ostrich fleeing at a 
speed that none may rival; the snarling leopard and 
coiled python, with their lethal beauty; the zebras, 
barking in the moonlight, as the laden caravan passes 
on its night march through a thirsty land. In after 
years there shall come to him memories of the lion's 
charge ; of the gray bulk of the elephant, close at hand 
in the sombre woodland; of the buffalo, his sullen eyes 
lowering from under his helmet of horn; of the rhi- 
noceros, truculent and stupid, standing in the bright 
sunlight on the empty plain. 

u These things can be told. But there are no words 
that can tell the hidden spirit of the wilderness, that 
can reveal its mystery, its melancholy, and its charm. 
There is delight in the hardy life of the open, in long 
rides rifle in hand, in the thrill of the fight with danger- 
ous game. Apart from this, yet mingled with it, is the 
strong attraction of the silent places, of the large tropic 
moons, and the splendor of the new stars ; where the 
wanderer sees the awful glory of sunrise and sunset in 
the wide waste spaces of the earth, unworn of man, and 
changed only by the slow change of the ages through 
time everlasting." 

" He loved the great game as if he were their 
father " is the smile-provoking quotation, from 
the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, prefixed to this 
remorseless record of harrying and slaughter. 
It is a book primarily for hunters, and second- 
arily for naturalists, with probably what will 
prove strong claims on the "general reader"; 
but it will never find a place beside those quiet, 
loving studies of animate nature that have come 
to us from the leisurely pen of White, of 
Jefferies, of Thoreau, and of many others that 
could be named. Its rush and stir and stren- 
uousness compel the attention of the hour, but 
give no sure promise of anything like immortal- 
ity. It will doubtless take rank among the 
best-sellers, despite its bulk and price, and then, 
like most best-sellers, it will have had its day. 
It must not here be dismissed, however, with- 
out a word of warm praise for its many excel-

Flemish masterpieces, it is supposed to bring 
comfort and confidence to the prospective pur- 
chaser. If on the strength of this endorsement 
the latter buys the picture, it will probably be 
a satisfaction to him to possess a copy of Smith's 
work for his own persual and to show to his 
friends. He will keep a marker at the page 
where the mention of his picture occurs ; will 
compare Smith's description of the subject with 
his own impression of it ; note the collections to 
which the picture has previously belonged, the 
engravings, if any, that have been made of it, 
and the prices at which it has changed hands in 
the past or was appraised by Smith. He will 
rehearse these particulars to his friends, point- 
ing in proud conclusiveness to the printed words 
which to those who themselves are not writers 
carry such a weight of importance. 

" Smith's Catalogue Raisonne " has long been 
at a premium. It may be only a legend of the 
salesroom, but I have heard of the original and 
only edition of nine volumes fetching as much 
as $ 1500. A copy which lies upon my desk, 
borrowed for purposes of comparison, was bought 
at public auction for close upon $900. The fact 
of its scarcity, coupled with the prevalent notion 
of the importance of the work, is sufficient ex- 
planation of the appearance of a new edition. 
This is an absolutely direct reprint of the ori- 
ginal, reproduced page by page apparently by 
photography, for even the typographical errors 
of the original reappear. The only variation is 
the insertion in the new edition of a consider- 
able number of fairly good photogravure im-

pressions of pictures described in the text. The 
reason for this scrupulous adherence to the form 
of the original is a good one, as far as it goes, 
since every reference that has been made to the 
work by volume, page, and number, can be 
identified as well in the new edition as in the 
old. The continuing value of the work as a 
book of reference is unimpaired. Meanwhile, 
this identity involves objections, to be mentioned 
later. 

Smith his name was John enjoyed dur- 
ing the earlier part of the last century an honor- 
able reputation as a dealer in pictures of the 
schools that were then popular with collectors. 
The vogue, as he himself states, excluded the 
Italian schools, and embraced pictures " of the 
first class " by Dutch and Flemish masters, 
with a partial appreciation of French art in the 
persons of Nicholas Poussin, Claude Lorrain, 
and Greuze. The first volume of his great work 
was published by subscription in 1829. It deals 
with what we reckon to-day as some of the less 
important genre painters Gerard Dou, Pietcr 
Van Slingelandt, Frank Mieris, Willem Van 
Mieris, Adrian Van Ostade, Isaac Van Ostade, 
and the brilliant and vivacious Philip Wouwer- 
inan. The enumeration throws an interesting 
light upon contemporary taste. 

The author begins with an Introduction, in 
which he addresses himself to collectors and pur- 
chasers, urging them on the one hand not to 
sacrifice the value of their treasures by injudi- 
cious cleaning and restoration, and warning 
them on the other against the wiles of the dealer 
in respect of copies and faked masterpieces. All 
of this, barring a little flavor of the rhetorical 
manner, reads very modernly. " Connoisseurs " 
of that time, it seems, were no more immune 
than our own from the epidemic of fraud ; per- 
haps our present-day victims may be able to ex- 
tract from this some balm of consolation. Thus 
launched upon his adventure, Smith prefaces 
each list of pictures with a short account of the 
painter. The one concerning Dou is principally 
composed of anecdotal gossip, drawn probably 
from Houbraken, and of generalized statements 
about the " finish " of his style. When facts are 
involved, they cannot be accepted without ex- 
amination. He gives, for example, the name of 
one of Dou's teachers as Rouwhorn, instead of 
Couwenhorn; and in the same volume assigns 
1620 as the date of Wouwerman's birth, although 
that artist was baptized in Haarlem on the 24th 
of May, 1619. These errors are symptomatic. 
Whether they result from carelessness, or from 
necessary ignorance of the facts that later exact

study has revealed, they render the biographi- 
cal portion of the work ^ nerally unreliable. 

However, it is only fair to add that the claim 
of the work to perennial value is based upon 
the " Catalogue Raisonne " the description of 
the pictures of each painter that had come 
within the purview of Smith's study. They 
comprise the examples at that time known to 
exist in the public galleries and principal private 
collections in England, Holland, Belgium, Ger- 
many, and France. Of these in most cases the 
author seems to have had first-hand knowledge 
and to have made the descriptions from per- 
sonal observation. Meanwhile, of other exam- 
ples, in galleries lying outside of his own range 
of travel, he frankly admits that his informa- 
tion has been gathered from hearsay or second- 
hand sources, and claims indulgence for possible 
or even probable errors. 

Smith's first volume was so well received that 
he followed it by seven more, published in as 
many successive years, and finally, after a pause 
of five years, he issued a bulky Supplement. 
Meanwhile, in 1838, appeared another work of 
somewhat corresponding scope. This was 
Gustave Fried rich Waagen's " Art and Artists 
in England," better known by the title of its 
re-published edition (1854), "Treasures of 
Art in Great Britain." In his preface, Dr. 
Waagen, alluding to Smith's " Catalogue Rai- 
sonne*," observes : " Many opinions on pictures 
to which we cannot assent proceed more from a 
regard to the possessors than from want of bet- 
ter judgment." To this Smith naturally takes 
exception, and hits back at the German. "An 
author," he says, "however talented, should 
surely have paused before pronouncing opinions 
on works of art of the highest importance cal- 
culated to injure valuable property ; both the 
names of painters of high-class pictures are 
changed to those of inferior masters, and the 
state of preservation of many fine pictures is 
seriously misrepresented." Among the instances 
which Smith cites of " inferior " attribution is 
the " Christ Disputing with the Doctors " of 
the National Gallery. At that date it was as- 
signed to Leonardo da Vinci ; but subsequent 
criticism has confirmed the judgment of Dr. 
Waagen that it is the work of Luini. 

It was candid of Smith to quote, in the pre- 
face to his Supplement, Dr. Waagen's criticism 
of himself ; for the shrewd German has exposed 
the bias to which a picture-dealer, however hon- 
est, can scarcely help leaning. Even if only un- 
consciously, he is interested in flattering his pa- 
trons and in extolling the value of their posses- 



sions, many of which have reached them through 
himself. Moreover, Smith had not the critical 
faculty as highly developed as Waagen. The 
latter's work in consequence has come better 
through the test of modern scientific criticism. 
While the two works do not cover the same 
ground, though in part they overlap, the Waagen 
is recognised to-day as the more generally ser- 
viceable. 

Meanwhile both of them are being put out of 
decisive commission by works of later and closer 
criticism. Had the new edition of Smith's 
" Catalogue Raisonne " been brought up to date, 
its publication would have been hailed with 
genuine satisfaction ; but merely to reproduce 
it with its original errors of commission and 
omission seems to be an act of dubious useful- 
ness ; the more so that a work of definite value, 
based upon Smith's, is now in course of being 
achieved. This is the catalogue of the most 
eminent Dutch painters of the seventeenth cen- 
tury, which is being compiled under the author- 
ity of the Dutch critic and historian of art, Dr. 
C. Hofstede de Groot. It will consist of eight 
or nine volumes, two of which have been already 
published, while a third is to be expected shortly. 
When this is completed, it will, in conjunction 
with Max Rooses' works on the painters of Ant- 
werp, relegate Smith to a position of merely 
antiquarian interest.

MEMORIALS or A GIFTED WOMAN.* 

It is chiefly to Louise Chandler Moulton that 
lovers of poetry are indebted for adequate knowl- 
edge of the life and talents of that blind poet of 
England, whose life ended almost at it> l'u r m- 
ning of fulfillment, Philip Bourke Marston. 
Among the many autographed books bequeathed 
by Mrs. Moulton to the Boston Public Library, 
is a copy of Marston 's Poems, inscribed to her 
as "true poet and true friend." It is this in- 
scription that suggests the fitting sub-title to 
Miss Lilian Whiting's memorial biography, in 
which she has portrayed her subject's tender 
and generous womanhood, and has testified that 
"poetry with Mrs. Moulton was a serious art 
and an object of earnest pursuit." 

Miss Whiting's biography is direct and clear 
in its method, chronological and narrative rather 
than critical, compiled largely from the letters 
of Mrs. Moulton and from the journal that was

kept faithfully from her eighth year to the lasi 
days of failing health but unfading activities oJ 
mind and heart. If the comments and entries 
seem over-effusive, in some places, and the trib- 
utes almost too adulatory in tone, we musl 
remember that such was the atmosphere in which 
Mrs. Moulton lived for many years. The reader 
who has chanced to be among the guests at the 
" Fridays " in Rutland Square, which for thirty 
years were considered a feature of Boston's social 
and literary life, will recall the group of admir- 
ing friends and celebrities from abroad who 
clustered about Mrs. Moulton in her library 
furnished in large part by gifts of authors and 
artists, listening to her reminiscences of distin- 
guished people or urging her to recite, in her 
sensitive musical voice, some favorite lines of 
verse. Scores of men and women in this coun- 
try who have been debtors to this hostess, and 
many more acquaintances in England, will wel- 
come this biography, although to the disinter- 
ested critic its permanent value may not be 
apparent. In addition to its revelation of the 
poet's personality, the volume furnishes several 
interesting thumb-nail sketches, and some excel- 
lent anecdotes of literary society in Boston, New 
York, and London during the last quarter of 
the nineteenth century. 

With due acknowledgment of Mrs. Moulton 's 
gifts of personal charm and poetic sentiment 
and refinement, few discriminating readers 
would ascribe to her verses that indefinable 
quality which we call genius. It is unfortunate, 
perhaps, that Miss Whiting begins her biog- 
raphy with this challenging word, as one of the 
implied characteristics of her subject. In her 
general treatment of Mrs. Moulton 's poetry, 
however, she shows justice and reserve as well 
as sympathetic appreciation. Throughout the 
poems brief, delicate lyrics like "Roses," 
" Laus Veneris," and " Now and Then," and 
the artistic sonnets, fittingly compared with 
those of Christina Rossetti and Mrs. Browning, 
were expressed rare delight in beauty, crav- 
ing for love, and subtle, mystic gropings for 
some knowledge of the invisible beyond. 
After the publication, in 1890, of "In the 
Garden of Dreams," George Meredith wrote to 
Mrs. Moulton, " You are getting to a mastery 
of the sonnet that is rare, and the lyrics are 
exquisite." The sonnet, "Help Thou My 
Unbelief," was widely quoted and commended 
by churchmen and literary critics alike. Miss 
Whiting thinks that the moods of tragic doubt 
and longing that assailed Mrs. Moulton were 



due in part to temperamental traits, and in part 
to the influence of early Calvinistic teachings 
in a home that otherwise abounded in whole- 
some and tender surroundings. These cravings 
and gropings limited her vision and gave to 
many of her verses a tincture of sadness of 
which she was conscious, for she wrote in her 
journal : 

" Louise Guiney and I are looking over my poems 
together. Oh, I wish there were more variety in them. 
They are good (I hope and think) in form, but they are, 
almost all, the cry of my heart for the love that I long 
for, or its protest against the death that I fear. Ah, 
well, I can only be myself." 

It was the fortune, or misfortune, of Mrs. 
Moulton to win immediate literary success, 
represented by extravagant praise and a sale 
of twenty thousand copies of her first book, 
" This, That, and the Other," issued when she 
was eighteen, a potpourri of sentimental 
rhymes, sketches, and tales, which she had con- 
tributed to newspapers and annuals. These 
writings, says Miss Whiting, " were as typical 
of the fashion of the day as the bonnets of the 
forties which one finds in a dusty attic." Mar- 
ried at twenty to William Upham Moulton, an 
editor and publisher of Boston, she was kindly 
received into local society, and her poems and 
prose found places in the leading periodicals. 
To the New York " Tribune " and " Indepen- 
dent " she wrote, for several years, weekly letters 
of literary gossip, of the witty friendly sort, and 
later sent similar columns from London to the 
Boston " Herald." Volumes of short stories 
and travel-sketches, now forgotten, had ephem- 
eral interest, but the prose which seems to have 
the most lasting charm is contained in her two 
volumes of "Bedtime Stories," dedicated to her 
daughter, and beloved to-day by many mothers 
and children in England and America. In 
memories of her own youth and its simple noble 
environment of nature and love, Mrs. Moulton 
was most spontaneous and sincere. One of her 
finest lyrics, tender and strong, was " Strength 
of the Hills," immortalizing Pomfret, Con- 
necticut, and her birthplace there. 

1 My thoughts go home to that old brown house 
With its low roof sloping down to the east, 
And its garden fragrant with roses and thyme 
That blossom no longer except in rhyme, 
Where the honey-bees used to feast. 

Afar in the west the great hills rose, 

Silent and steadfast, and gloomy and gray. 
I thought they were giants, and doomed to keep 
Their watch while the world should wake or sleep, 
Till the trumpet should sound on the judgment-day.

" And I was as young as the hills were old, 

And the world was warm with the breath of spring; 
And the roses red and the lilies white 
Budded and bloomed for my heart's delight, 
And the birds in my heart began to sing." 

This record of Mrs. Moulton's life has many 
pages commemorative of her social experiences 
abroad, for almost without exception, from 1876 
to 1907, she passed long summers in England, 
with side-excursions on the Continent. Her 
journals often read like the "society column" 
of a metropolitan newspaper, jottings of 
luncheons, dinners, and week-ends at the homes 
of nobility and writers, or in studios of famous 
artists. There are interesting impressions and 
a few anecdotes of Browning, Thomas Hardy, 
Lord Houghton, Swinburne, George Eliot, 
Dore", Stephane Mallarme, and many other 
people of note. Her social activity never wholly 
interfered with daily literary work in some form, 
although her biographer says truly that this 
work "was done in an atmosphere utterly in- 
compatible with imaginative production." Her 
poetry was well received in England ; " Swallow- 
Flights " was published there, in 1877, and 
thus favorably reviewed by the conservative 
" Athenaeum " : 

" It is not too much to say of these poems that they 
exhibit delicate and rare beauty, marked originality, 
and perfection of style. What is still better, they 
impress us with a sense of subtle and vivid imagination, 
and that spontaneous feeling which is the essence of 
lyrical poetry." 

Miss Whiting emphasizes her conviction, 
which is shared by many friends of Mrs. 
Moult. >n. that the latter craved and prized the 
companionship of talented and interesting people 
more than she cared for society, in the usual 
restricted meaning of that word. Her conditions 
of life and personal graces brought her into 
close acquaintance with people of talent whose 
homes were affluent and hospitable, but her 
kindliness and genuine sympathy with humanity 1 
impelled her to give as cordial a welcome to the 
obscure and those in need of help and encourage- 
ment as she gave to the wealthy and famous. 
Her correspondence in her later years was bur- 
densome, often increased by appeals for aid and 
advice in literary work, and to such inquirers 
she gave generously of her time and suggestions. 
She exemplified in her life her words found in 
a chapter on "The Gospel of Charm" in 
" Ourselves and Our Neighbors ": 

M So many new gospels are being preached, and that 
so strenuously, to the girls and women of the twentieth 
oentnry, that I have wondered if there might not be a 
danger lest the Gospel of Charm should be neglected. 
And yet to my mind there are few teachings more 



important I would advocate no charm that was insin- 
cere, and none that would loscn tin- happiness of any 
other woman; but the fact remains that the slightest 
act may be done with a graciousness that warms the 
day, or with a hard indifference that almost repels us 
from goodness itself. It is possible to buy a newspaper 
or pay a oar-fare in such wise as to make newsboy or 
car-conductor feel for the moment that he is in a 
friendly world." 

The last chapter of Miss Whiting's volumr 
contains a list of the books, to be known as the 
Moulton Collection, which have been acquired 
as a legacy by the Boston Public Library, with 
valuable comments and inscriptions chosen by 
Professor Arlo Bates, a loyal friend and literary 
co-worker of Mrs. Moulton's. The book is well 
illustrated from photographs.

BOCCACCIO AND HIS DK< \ M 1 HON.* 



So much new literature about Boccaccio and 
the Decameron attests a growing impression of 
the man and his work as deserving of serious 
study. The popular notion of him as a naughty 
writer will no doubt subsist. The Decameron will 
remain taboo to the little moralist and the short- 
sighted censor, and will continue to be placed, 
with " Tom Jones " and "Roderick Random," 
and Maupassant, and, alas! Montaigne, upon 
that schoolboy list of guilty tidbits which is so 
mysteriously passed down from generation to 
generation. This is regrettable ; but it cannot 
be helped, and it cannot put the Decameron 
upon the Indejr ejyuryutorius of any healthy 
mind. Mr. Hutton, in the preface to his bio- 
graphical study of Boccaccio, disclaims the 
intention to apologize for or to defend his 
subject. " His life, the facts of his life, his 
love, his humanity, and his labours, plentifully 
set forth in this work, will defend him with the 
simple of heart more eloquently than I could 
hope to do. And it might seem that one who 
exhausted his little patrimony in the acquire- 
ment of learning, who gave Homer back to us, 
who founded or certainly fixed Italian prose, 
who was the defender of Petrarch, the passionate

defender of Dante, and who died in the pursuit 
of knowledge, should need no defence anywhere 
from anyone." 

The tone of the champion is not absent from 
this declaration of faith. We know very well 
what the writer's opinion is of Boccaccio's 
detractors. But he attempts no repression of 
those facts which cannot be brought into accord 
with our sexual code ; they are to be taken 
into account with the other facts in making up 
our final estimate of the man. If the story of 
Boccaccio and Fiammetta is told very fully, and 
indeed with a kind of gusto, not less pains and 
enthusiasm are expended upon the events of 
Boccaccio's more mature experience. Though 
his enjoyment of youth was superabundant, age 
drew upon him apace. At thirty-seven he was 
alone in the world. His few relatives, his 
Fiammetta, were all dead. " He had seen Flor- 
ence run with blood, and every sort of torture 
and horror stalk abroad at Naples. Rome, if he 
ventured there, can have appeared to him little 
less than a shambles. Rienzi, with all that hope, 
had come and vanished like a ghost. The fairest 
province in Italy lay under the heel of a bar- 
barian invader." Finally came the plague 
a final blow to the optimist the plague which 
was to supply a strange setting for his prose 
masterpiece. 

"The Decameron," says Mr. Hutton, "is an 
absolute work of art, as ' detached ' as a play 
of Shakespeare or a portrait by Velasquez. The 
scheme is formal and immutable, a miracle of 
design in which almost everything can be ex- 
pressed." But he admits that the Canterbury 
Tales equal the Decameron in design, and far 
excel it in characterization. Boccaccio's story- 
tellers are not individualized ; they are little 
more than mouthpieces. And he (with some- 
what unneccessary reluctance) admits that the 
Decameron " lacks a certain idealism, a certain 
moral sense which is never absent from English 
work, and which, even from a purely aesthetic 
point of view, would have given a sort of balance 
or sense of proportion to the book which, I con- 
fess, in my weaker moments, it has sometimes 
seemed to me it lacks." It would have been 
better for Mr. Hutton to acknowledge this lack 
cheerfully, offsetting against it, by way of con- 
solation, a lack of the hypocrisy often present in 
English work. Whatever its demerits, this biog- 
raphy is a spirited and sincere piece of work. 

The four-volume reprint of the Decameron 
edited by Mr. Hutton for the " Tudor Trans- 
lations " series is a model of typographical 
dignity and beauty. The text is a reprint of 



the first English translation that approximated 
completeness. It was published in London in 
1620 by Isaac Jaggard. Mr. Hutton calls it the 
first "practically complete" edition in English, 
and says that it is "translated inaccurately 
but very splendidly, apparently from the French 
version of Antoine Le Macon." " Practically 
complete" seems a sweeping phrase to use of a 
version which omits entire tales and so garbles 
and Bowdlerizes others as to make them hardly 
recognizable. For instance, the tale of Rustico 
and Alibech may be more amusing than edify- 
ing, or may be adjudged neither ; but to have it 
absolutely omitted, and a long moral tale sub- 
stituted, is to take the name of the translator in 
vain . Many of the other tales are rather adapted 
than rendered; and the splendor of the transla- 
tion, where it is a translation, is not sufficiently 
overwhelming to make up for our deprivations. 
The English is rather cumbrous and halting in 
comparison with that later translation, also 
anonymous, which appeared in 1741, and which 
formed the basis of what must be considered the 
standard English version. 

The other two books in the present group 
offer the results of research rather than of criti- 
cism. Mr. Lee's attempt has been " to give a 
concise but as far as possible complete account 
of the sources of the tales in Boccaccio's Decam- 
eron, with notices of the various parallels and 
analogues . ' ' No previous attempt has been made 
to do just this thing, and the result is a book 
invaluable to students of Boccaccio and his 
period. One by one the tales are taken up, the 
sources, analogues, and obvious imitations in 
contemporary and subsequent literature dis- 
cussed, with a synopsis of many of the variants. 
One is given practically a series of independent 
notes on each of the novels ; they are all readable 
as literature, as well as packed with information. 

Miss Jones's " Boccaccio and his Imitators " 
is a drier and narrower product of modern re- 
search. There is a brief and somewhat conven- 
tional introductory essay on the subject; for 
the rest, the investigator is content to tabulate 
her results. There is a table to determine the 
relative popularity of the tales on the basis of 
the number of imitations registered. There is 
another table giving a summary of the Boccac- 
cio tales imitated by ten authors, selected two 
by two from Germany, England, France, Spain, 
and Italy, " to show the wide geographical dis- 
tribution of these tales of the Decameron," etc. 
Altogether, we find tabulated some 850 imi- 
tations of the Decameron tales. 

It cannot be denied that there is a humorous

aspect to this painstaking and spectacled grub- 
bing among the bones and the dust of the joyous 
Decameron. For a joyous book it is, though 
marred for the Anglo-American reader by the 
acrid tang of a sensualism a variety of sen- 
sualism peculiar to the Latin races. And 
yet it is well for us to to be advised from time 
to time that this story-teller was no mere trifler, 
but a man of generous mould, whose propor- 
tions grow rather than dwindle as time passes.

A CONFEDERATE'S HISTORY OF THE 
CIVIL, WAR.* 

It must be premised that Mr. Eggleston, 
author of the latest history of our Civil War, 
served in the Confederate army, and that the 
writer of this review also spent four years in the 
same service. Whatever the author's Southern 
proclivities may have been, he seems to have 
approached his task in a spirit of fairness and 
impartiality, in which he has doubtless been 
aided by his long residence in the North since 
the war ; he has tried to divest himself of pre- 
judice, and to hold the scales of justice evenly. 

The work is divided into two books, of which 
the first, comprising 173 pages, treats of "The 
Causes of the War," and the second of " The 
Conduct of the War." It is hard to treat the 
causes of the war impartially, even at this day, 
although the author says : " The passions of the 
war are completely gone. Even in politics, war 
prejudices no longer play a part worth consider- 
ing" (p. 11). This is probably in the main 
correct, notwithstanding the recent sporadic 
ebullition of "war prejudices" over the erec- 
tion of a statue of General Lee at the Capitol. 
Only one other criticism on the first book, and 
I pass to the second and by far the more impor- 
tant one. The author says : As for the ex- 
tremists [/. e., of the South] , they anticipated 
military commissions and political preferment 
for themselves, and they cared for little else 
than to occupy a conspicuous place in public 
attention for a little while" (p. 172). The 
present reviewer was of full age when he entered 
the Southern service, and he saw nothing of 
what is here charged. In fact, he has always 
regarded the action of his comrades, in April, 
1861, as purely unselfish and patriotic; and 
time has in no wise changed his views. 

THR HISTORY or THK CoNriiDKRATR WAR : lu Cauaw 
and ita Conduct. A Narrative and Critical History. By 
George Car? Egglerton. In two volumes. New York: 
Walton Co. 



In treating the conduct of the war, the author 
follows the usual chronological order. In his 
chapter on Fort Sumter, he says : " At the 
South, practically all the able-bod ie<l yonnjj 
men were enlisted in what were then called 
* volunteer companies/ though it did not yet 
appear in what cause they were supposed to be 
volunteering" (p. 187). The present reviewer 
was one of that class, and he thinks he knew 
perfectly well in what cause he was volunteer- 
ing; and he was not wiser than his comrades. 
That remark might well have been omitted. 
The author speaks of the Buchanan adminis- 
tration as "seemingly at least, promising the 
early evacuation of Fort Sumter." There was 
no " seemingly " about it, even after Lincoln's 
inauguration. We all remember Seward's noted 
telegram: "Faith fully kept; wait and see." 
We waited, and we saw; but we did not see 
" faith fully kept," but something very different. 
The " pepper-box strategy " of the Federal 
government in 1861 is commented on, and an 
account is given of the first battle of Manassas 
(Bull Run), with the Confederate mistake of 
not pressing on to Washington, and the conse- 
quent " paralysis of victory " on the part of the 
Confederates. A chapter on " The European 
Menace" follows. There was never any real 
prospect of European intervention. It was a 
Deus ex machina for which the Confederates 
were always wrongly hoping; but if they had 
discarded all thought of it, and trusted entirely 
to their own arms ; it would have been better for 
them. The chapter on " Border Operations," 
in its conclusion, touches upon the formation 
of the State of West Virginia a thoroughly 
unconstitutional operation from every point of 
view, but, like the emancipation of the slaves, 
defended, as President Lincoln always con- 
tended, as a war-measure. The importance of 
the blockade is rightly emphasized, for without 
it the United States could never have hoped to 
be successful. (In this chapter the misprint 
" Pocotatigo," for Pocotaligo, occurs three 
times.) What the author denominates " the 
era of incapacity " follows, in which Halleck is 
greatly depreciated and Grant magnified ; but 
Halleck had at least written a book on strategy, 
in which he showed himself familiar \vith its 
theory, while Grant had not yet shown what 
was in him. As soon as President Lincoln 
found Grant out, there were no more domineer- 
ings by Halleck, who sank to his proper level.

event, Shiloh would undoubtedly have been a 
Confederate victory the first day, and there 
would have been no need for the second day's 
battle which Beauregard lost to Buell's fresh 
troops. 

The war in the West is treated in better 
perspective than that in the East, where the 
exploits of the Army of the Potomac and of 
the Army of Northern Virginia are chiefly 
dwelt upon. After Farragut's capture of New 
Orleans in which chapter Butler receives a 
few well- deserved touches we return to Mc- 
Clellan, who had been all winter getting ready 
for his Richmond campaign. It should be 
remarked, in passing, that Fredericksburg is 
not on the Potomac (p. 356), and that Joseph E. 
Johnston himself made the stand at Williams- 
burg in order to give his wagon-train time to 
retire (p. 357). The author rightly remarks 
that " McClellan was not Grant, nor such as he " 
(p. 359) ; but he seems to forget that Grant had 
not yet been developed. And he might have 
recalled Grant's own words, in which he said 
that neither he, nor General Sherman, nor any 
officer known to him in the war, could have 
done better than McClellan did under the con- 
ditions in which the latter was placed in his 
operations on the Peninsula. 

If Mr. Eggleston had read the work of the 
late Colonel Allan on " Jackson's Valley Cam- 
paign," he would have obtained a clearer view 
of that stirring event, and especially of the 
cause of Secretary Benjamin's order which 
induced Jackson's resignation. The order re- 
ferred to was due to the request of General 
Loring to be ordered back from Romney to 
Winchester ; and the only result of it was the 
relief of Loring from service with Jackson. 
Too much is made of this incident. Benjamin 
did not " sacrifice " anything that " Jackson's 
energy and genius had accomplished in the 
Valley." Jackson continued "master of the 
Valley," and nobody was discouraged, except 
perhaps some of Loring's troops who thought 
they had been hardly dealt with. Having 
been Jackson's Ordnance officer in the Valley, 
the writer of this review saw something of the 
" snow and sleet and slush and mud." Jack- 
son did not have the troops that would have 
justified an invasion of Maryland and Penn- 
sylvania; he was merely " bluffing,'' as was his 
wont. While Secretary Benjamin is to blame 
for yielding to General Loring's request, and 
directing Jackson to order Loring back to 
Winchester, thus overriding both Jackson and 
Johnston, it is doubtful if anything was lost by 



it, for Romney was not " the strategic key to 
the position." It was a mere outpost, and 
Jackson would undoubtedly soon have ordered 
Loring back ; but this does not excuse Secretary 
Benjamin's action. The reviewer would like to 
dwell on Jackson's Valley campaign, which he 
went through to the end; but lack of space 
forbids. 

Next we have accounts of the Seven Days' 
Battles, the Second Manassas Campaign, and 
Lee's First Invasion of Maryland ; but the treat- 
ment is very meagre especially of the last 
campaign, which involved one of the best-fought 
battles of the war (Antietam), where the Con- 
federates had but about 36,000 men against 
McClellan's 90,000. McClellan's mistake was 
in not putting in more men, for they were there. 
We fought from daylight to 9 a. m., resisting 
successively Hooker, Mansfield, and Sedgwick, 
when we were at last forced back on the left, 
but not far, and as soon as some of McLaws's 
troops came up from Harper's Ferry the Fed- 
erals were forced back across the Hagerstown 
pike, where they stayed until we retired the 
second night, and recrossed the Potomac after 
sunrise. 

In the chapter on the Seven Days* Battles 
(p. 400), "twenty-seventh " is wrongly printed 
for twenty-sixth ; it is important to be accurate 
as to the day here. The author says (p. 407) : 
" Magruder and Huger failed Lee at the crisis "; 
but to these Jackson himself should be added, 
for he too failed on this day (June 30) to do 
what was expected of him. The battle of 
Malvern Hill (July 1) should never have been 
fought; it was fought by detachments until 
ten p. m., rather than nine, with no result but 
the loss of many brave men. The author calls 
Pope " a good and active officer, unfortunately 
given to vainglorious boastings" (p. 417); but 
I cannot concur in this commendation, for he 
wrecked a body of good troops when he should 
have gained the day at the second battle of 
Manassas. Lincoln's opinion of Pope is shown 
by his action in restoring McClellan to com- 
mand; but the latter's treatment was "hard 
lines " after his relief of Maryland from Lee's 
invasion. While McClellan was slow, he was 
certainly capable, which cannot be said of his 
successor, Burnside, who persisted in " butting 
his head against a stone wall" and suffered the 
bloody repulse of Fredericksburg. 

After a brief account of this exploit, the 
author continues his narrative of the war in 
the West. Here, as elsewhere in the work, a 
more plentiful sprinkling of dates would be 



182

desirable, and a reasonable supply of maps 
would have helped the narrative, for "chron- 
ology and geography are the eyes of history." 
Bragg is "let off easy" for his Kentucky cam- 
paign, the only result of which was "a rich 
booty of supplies," when so much had been 
expected from it. It is very true that the dis- 
proportionate numbers of Bragg and Buell must 
be taken into consideration, but it does seem 
that with better management Buell might have 
been prevented from reaching Louisville. The 
subsequent battle of Murfreesboro, between 
Bragg and Rosecrans, may be rightly called a 
drawn battle; but the Confederacy could not 
afford to fight drawn battles. 

We now travel East again, to the field of 
Chancellorsville, (Vol. II., p. 83), where Hooker 
had 180,000 men against Lee's 60,000, for but 
two divisions of Longstreet's corps (McLaws's 
and Anderson's) were with Lee. (It may be 
remarked, in passing, that Lee's soldiers did 
not call him " Mas' Bob " (p. 89), but " Mas' 
Robert"; though writers often make this mis- 
take.) An interesting account of the Chancel- 
lorsville battle is given, which, however, requires 
one or two corrections. " Hanover Court House " 
(p. 100) should be " Hanover Junction "; and 
u Culpeper " (p. 101) would have been a bad 
route to take to reach Richmond, it being on 
the road to Washington, where Hooker could 
have easily headed off Lee even without cavalry. 
The author quotes Dodge's " Campaign of 
Chancellorsville," but he should also have read 
Allan's book on the same subject. The chief 
defect in the treatment of this battle is the 
failure to mention that Hooker was stunned by 
a shell striking a post against which he was 
leaning, which seriously affected his power of 
thought at a critical moment. The next in 
command, General Couch, should have directed 
the fight thereafter, but does not seem to have 
done so. 

Following this battle, we have an account of 
the Gettysburg campaign, the events of which 
are familiar to all readers of military history. 
Here I must take exception to the author's 
use of an expression in speaking of General 
Stuart, "who had no discretion." Stuart had 
much discretion , as was shown at Chancellorsville, 
when he took command of Jackson's corps at 
the latter's request ; but in his march to Carlisle 
he met with obstacles that he had not antici- 
pated. Too much has been made of Stuart's 
absence from the main army on this march. 
Ewell" should read "Hill," on p. 135; for 
Ewell joined Hill later in the day on the left, 



Hill having brought on the battle of July 1.) 
The author rightly says (p. 143) : " Long- 
street's support of Lee's plan of battle seems to 
have lacked something of efficiency the lack of 
which may have been determinative of results." 
This is putting it mildly. Longstreet's advice 
had been overridden, and as a consequence his 
heart was not in the fight. The battle was not 
fought with the force that General Lee intended, 
and it was therefore a predestined failure. The 
author closes the chapter with a comment on 
the inactivity after Gettysburg : " The where- 
fore of this inactivity has never been explained " 
(p. 150). To anyone who was there it seems 
patent enough. Men are not machines, and 
superhuman efforts cannot be kept up indefi- 
nitely. 

Next we have an account of the Vicksburg 
campaign, with certain comments on " the state 
of things after Gettysburg." The author ex- 
aggerates the conduct of " Winder's men," the 
provost-guard of Richmond (p. 179). The 
present reviewer got to Richmond very seldom 
during the war, although his home was within 
twenty-five miles of it ; but if he had ever gone 
without a written leave, he deserved to be ar- 
rested. The events following Gettysburg must 
be greatly condensed in this brief review. 
The struggle for Charleston is followed by 
the Chickamauga and Chattanooga campaigns. 
There must always be a scapegoat for lack of 
success, and Bragg now served the purpose ; so, 
after Grant's success at Chattanooga, though 
it was partly accidental, Gen. Joseph E. 
Johnston was put in command of the Confed- 
erate Western army. He conducted an admir- 
able defensive campaign from Dalton to Atlanta. 
But the South wanted an advance, not a 
retreat ; so when Johnston reached Atlanta, 
President Davis committed the astonishing blun- 
der (though urged to it by those in whom he had 
confidence) of relieving him of his command and 
replacing him with Hood an excellent fighter 
as a division commander, but totally unequal 
to the responsibilities placed upon him, as was 
later seen. 

Grant was transferred to Virginia at the 
opening of the campaign of 1864 ; and now 
began the struggle between the two great lead- 
ers, the one with overwhelming resources of both 
men and means, the other with neither men 
nor means for the emergency. The result 
was inevitable. The battles of the Wilderness, 
Spotsylvania, Hanover Junction, ('<>!<! ll:irbor, 
followed in quick succession, until although 
the summer was not over " this line " was

abandoned for one that could have been reached 
by water without the loss of a man, and the two 
armies settled down to the siege of Petersburg, 
which consumed nearly another year. Mean- 
while Sherman, finding nothing to oppose him 
when Hood started on his " wild-goose " trip to 
Nashville, was enabled to take his holiday jaunt 
to Savannah, himself furnishing a forceful illus- 
tration of his adage, "War is hell." There 
is an interesting account of " Early's Valley 
Campaign," in which the reviewer participated 
and which he would like to discuss did space 
allow. But Early's troops were needed at 
Petersburg, and took part in that siege during 
the last tragic months. The line was stretched 
until it snapped, and after Appomattox all was 
over. 

With certain corrections, some of which have 
been noted, Mr. Eggleston's book will serve as 
a good compendium of the history of the war. 
It has the advantage over some that have been 
written, in that it covers the whole field. Doubt- 
less some portions would have been treated in 
greater detail if it had not been necessary to con- 
dense the narrative. As a Confederate soldier, 
the reviewer can commend the impartiality with 
which the work is written ; and I think a Fed- 
eral soldier will find little, if anything, to object 
to, except perhaps in the under-estimate of 
General Early's numbers in his Valley cam- 
paign. Having been Ordnance officer of the 
largest division in Early's army, I well know 
the force with which the battle of Winchester 
(Sept. 19, 1864) was fought: about 9,500 
muskets. Adding officers (proportionately very 
few at that period) and artillery and cavalry, 
15,000 would be an over-estimate, against 
Sheridan's 45,000 men of all arms. (See

BRIEFS oisr NEW BOOKS. 

Mr. James Milne's ' ' My Summer in 
London " ( Button ) covers not only 
experiences and impressions, but re- 
trospections and memories as well. It is, in fact, a 
series of informal jottings, odd bits culled here 
and there from the varied adventures of a journalist, 
whose occupation has brought him in contact with 
many aspects of London life and with many great 
Londoners and good lovers of London. Among 
these last was John Hay, who, upon once being asked 
by Mr. Milne whether he was sorry to leave Lon- 
don, quoted Johnson's saying : " Why, sir, you find 
no man at all intellectual who is willing to leave 



London. No, sir, when a man is tired of London 
he is tired of life." This anecdote, recalled in con- 
nection with Mr. Milne's pleasure in coming to live 
in the very heart of the city, suggests a comment of 
Mark Twain's on Hay's "Prairie Bell"; while a 
description of London roofs at night brings back an 
evening when the author of " Wee Macgreegor " 
shared the weird sight, and incidentally told how he 
met the little "Glasgow pickle "named Macgreegor, 
who was the original of his famous character. Again 
Gladstone's statue in Westminster is the peg upon 
which hangs a characterization of the great states- 
man based on personal acquaintance, a description 
of his way of speaking, and an account of the visit 
of Li Hung Chang to England's Grand Old Man. 
The place to see royalty to advantage is not London ; 
Mr. Milne takes us to Balmoral for that, reproduc- 
ing the impressions of homely Highlanders, and 
showing kings, queens, and princes enjoying them- 
selves quite like other people. "What London 
Reads " is the title of a chapter enlivened by anec- 
dotes from the stores of some cynical booksellers. 
"Those Dear Americans" is full of dangerous 
generalizations and some amusing misconceptions, 
underlaid with keen interest in us and cordial appre- 
ciation of our breezy directness. Altogether Mr. 
Milne has filled his summer in town with real and 
varied interests, which his readers will enjoy shar- 
ing. Excellent photographs depict the author's 
favorite bits of his favorite city. 

The pragmatic Unde * the title . " The Influence of 
standpoint Darwin on Philosophy, and Other 

in philosophy. Essays in Contemporary Thought" 
(Holt), Professor John Dewey has collected a series 
of essays and addresses dealing with various aspects 
of the pragmatic movement in philosophy. The 
majority of these papers have previously appeared 
in one or another of the technical journals of philo- 
sophy. It is to the clientele of such journals, rather 
than to the "general reader" that they are adapted 
both in matter and in manner, but particularly in 
manner. The treatment is often rather severely 
metaphysical. To one somewhat out of practice in 
this particular kind of intellectual gymnastics the 
following of the subtleties of metaphysical discus- 
sions is a rather difficult business. Thus it is not 
immediately clear in what manner the following 
statement regarding the mutual relation conceived 
by the author to exist between a rose and its smell 
helps one either to understand or to enjoy a beauti- 
ful rose : " The import of the smell is the indicating 
and demanding relation which it sustains to the 
enjoyment of the rose as its fulfilling experience; 
while this enjoyment is just the content or definition 
of what the rose consciously meant, i. e., meant to 
mean." One must hasten to say, however, that even 
though Professor Dewey's style may not always in 
matters of detail be the most lucid in the world, 
these essays do form a real contribution to contem- 
porary thought. They give a critical and conserv- 
ative exposition of the pragmatic standpoint re-

garding a number of the fundamental problems of 
philosophy; such, for example, as the nature of 
truth, the basis of morals, the problem of knowledge, 
and the relation of belief to knowledge. The first 
essay gives the main title to the collection. Perhaps 
nowhere has the essential nature of the great and 
far-reaching effect which Darwin's work had upon 
all modern thought been so succinctly and happily 
expressed as it is in the following words which form 
the concluding summary of this first essay: "Intel- 
lectual progress usually occurs through sheer aban- 
donment of questions together with both of the alter- 
natives they assume an abandonment that results 
from their decreasing vitality and a change of 
urgent interest. We do not solve them : we get over 
them. Old questions are solved by disappearing, 
evaporating, while new questions corresponding to 
the changed attitude of endeavor and preference 
take their place. Doubtless the greatest dissolvent in 
contemporary thought of old questions, the greatest 
precipitant of new methods, new intentions, new 
problems, is the one effected by the scientific revo- 
lution that found its climax in the Origin of 
Species.' " 

Short, tudie, in A tifth volume of the Right Honor- 
hittory.t'oiitict, able George W. . Russell's re- 
and literature, printed papers from the Manchester 
Guardian " and other publications is now offered 
to the lover of miscellaneous chronicle and com- 
ment, cut up into short chapters and marked with 
a high degree of journalistic fluency and positive- 
ness of opinion. "Sketches and Snapshots" (Duf- 
field) contains fifty-five articles, largely reminiscent 
of noted persons now deceased, partly also of a 
political-historical character, and occasionally de- 
voted to literary criticism. The most considerable 
and most important chapter in the book has to do 
with Gladstone, whom the author knew well, both 
as a man and as a public character, and whom he 
greatly admired. Other personages, of more inter- 
est to English than to American readers, are treated 
in more or less detail. Coming to matters of literary 
and miscellaneous interest, we catch as we turn the 
pages the following sentence, commendable in its 
sentiment : " To ' speak the tongue that Shake- 
speare spake* is a stronger title to the world's 
regard than the possession of all the bloated arma- 
ments that delirium ever conceived, or the reddest 
of red lines ever traced across a subjected Conti- 
nent." Seasonable and likely to touch responsive 
chords is this concerning a world-language : " But 
what is that language to be ? Esperanto ? A thou- 
sand times, No; for unless it is remarkably unlike 
all other languages, Esperanto must be learnt; and 
I have no mind to replace myself, in tottering age, 
under the linguistic discipline which oppressed my 
youth." In literary themes the author will meet 
with some occasional dissent on the reader's part, 
as of course he will expect to do. A paper devoted 
to Matthew Arnold makes this most Greek of 
English poets to be of the school and of the lineage 



of Wordsworth. Thus to couple the author of 
IVter Bell" and the author of "Empedocles on 
Ktna" as poets of the same school will seem to 
many as emphasizing too strongly the common ele- 
ment of nature-love in the two. In so varied and 
comprehensive a volume as Mr. Russell's he will be 
hard to please who cannot find something to suit 
his taste. 

An Englith That something original can still be 
account of done by one writing about the Civil 

our Civil War, War fa^ been ghown by Mf John 

Formby, an English writer, whose two-volume work 
on "The American Civil War: A Concise History 
of its Causes, Progress, and Results" (Scribners) 
has just appeared. The arrangement of the work 
is unique. The author divides the field of opera 
tions into the following >r<-tions: Kast. Southeast. 
South, Southwest, and West. Each chapter relat- 
ing to the war covers a half year, and at the end 
of the chapter is placed a chronological table to 
show the progress of events in each section. The 
aim is so to arrange the account that the reader can 
keep in mind the entire field of operations, conse- 
quently each chapter takes up in turn the military 
operations of each section, with footnotes and cross- 
references on each page to show what is taking 
place elsewhere the blockade, the war at sea, 
affairs in Mexico, etc. Each chapter closes with 
estimates of the leaders on both sides, of the gains 
and losses of each combatant, and a short summary. 
In order to avoid confusion, Confederate names and 
titles are printed in italics. The maps, sixty-five 
in number and very good ones, are printed in a 
separate volume, and are standardized as to scale 
the first time that this has been done. Throughout 
the volume of narrative frequent references are 
made to the maps. The unusual arrangement of the 
text destroys its unity, though it undoubtedly adds 
to the value of the work for one making a close 
study of the campaigns. The style is at times 
involved. The views of the author are always 
interesting and sometimes original. His tracing of 
the causes which led to the war is not of much value, 
and the same may be said of the brief sketch of 
Reconstruction. On the other hand the importance 
of the French intrigues in Mexico is properly 
shown, and the Mexican affairs are well woven into 
the account of the general situation. Some of 
Mr. Formby's conclusions and opinions are inn-r- 
esting. For example, he asserts that the contest 
was decided in the really vital part of the country 
between the Mississippi River and the Appalachian-. 
and that the great campaigns of the East were <liu- 
mainly to political and sentimental considerations. 
The Confederacy, he says, had three chances of suc- 
cess: the first, to win by force of arms, was lost at 
Murfreesboro in December, 1862; the second, to 
win through recognition by foreign states, was lost 
at Gettysburg in 1863; and the third, to win by 
tiring out the North, was lost when Johnston was 
replaced by Hood in 1864. If the Confederacy

could have built an efficient marine engine the au- 
thor believes that its chances for success would have 
been greatly increased. As it was, the strong Con- 
federate ironclads could not be maneuvered. The 
Confederate military organization was, however, 
superior to the Federal, for in it each officer exer- 
cised command appropriate to his rank, and quar- 
rels over seniority were therefore infrequent. Some 
of the judgments expressed about the military lead- 
ers are of interest: Pope was "a most able offi- 
cer," in spite of his erratic speech; Rosecrans was 
" the best minor strategist the war produced "; Buell 
and McDowell were fine generals who were not 
allowed proper opportunities; Sidney Johnston is 
not highly regarded; Sheridan and Hardee "never 
found their limit"; Early was an "extraordinary" 
general; McClernand was one of the ablest of gen- 
erals but "the worst of politicals"; Semmes was 
unequalled for the making and carrying out of large 
designs ; Halleck was jealous, vindictive, obstinate, 
and untrustworthy; Joe Johnston and other engineer 
generals were prone to the defensive ; Sherman "was 
the cleverest intellect brought to bear on the war"; 
Lee was prejudiced in favor of Virginia generals. 

Pen portraits " Mad Shepherds, and Other Human 
of rustic Studies " (Holt), by Mr. L. P. Jacks, 

oddities. editor of The Hibbert Journal," 

belongs to that class of quietly realistic, semi- 
humorous, and semi-pathetic delineation of humble 
humanity that can almost be said to have come into 
being within the last decade, and to which Mr. John 
Galsworthy (in his sketches entitled collectively 
"A Motley") and Mr. Edward Thomas (in his 
" Rest and Unrest ") have very recently made note- 
worthy contributions. The plot and the continuity 
of the formal novel are lacking to these delicate 
little fabrications ; but the artistic touch, the insight, 
the creative imagination, and the tender sentiment 
of the romancer are present. How true to their 
originals such characters as the Mad Shepherds may 
be, or how far idealized and beautified, one cannot 
say ; but at any rate they convey the impression of 
reality viewed with the eyes of loving tenderness 
and large charity, and presented with artistic detach- 
ment and literary skill. What reader of books and 
student of human nature could fail to find rich enter- 
tainment in Mr. Jack's atheist shoemaker of whom 
we are told that " the boots of labourers out of work 
and of other unfortunates he mended free of cost, 
regularly devoting to this purpose that part of the 
Sabbath which was not occupied in proving the non- 
existence of God," and who, as one of his cronies 
said of him, " spent his breath in proving that God 
doesn't exist, and his life in proving that He does "? 
A baker's dozen of these captivating little character- 
studies, all breathing a sense of the mysteries and 
the sublimities of our common lot, are embraced 
in the little volume, which is provided with a 
frontispiece portrait of " Snarley Bob," mad shep- 
herd, or inspired shepherd, as the reader may choose 
to regard him. 



In order to " acquaint men who are 

Seven studies interested in the bearings of modern

history on public life with sundry 

statesmen whose time was devoted not to seeking 
office or to winning a brief popular fame by chican- 
ery or pettifoggery, but to serving the great inter- 
ests of modern states and, indeed, of universal 
humanity," Dr. Andrew D. White has made a care- 
ful study of " Seven Great Statesmen in the Warfare 
of Humanity with Unreason " (Century Co.), which 
he appropriately dedicates to the memory of another 
champion of humanity, the late Goldwin Smith. 
Statesmen of the European continent rather than 
of England or America have been chosen because, 
as the author says, "the great leaders of our own 
country and of Great Britain have already been 
fully and admirably portrayed for the American 
student of history," and also because, he continues, 
" my early years abroad were spent mainly upon 
the European continent, and public duties since 
have led me to make prolonged stays in various 
Continental states France, Germany, the Nether- 
lands, Italy, Russia where the study of Continen- 
tal statesmen has been almost forced upon me." 
Of the seven statesmen selected for portraiture, 
Sarpi, Grotius, Thomasius, Turgot, Stein, Cavour, 
Bismarck, the author could, of course, claim 
anything like first-hand knowledge of only the last 
two ; and even in Cavour's case he had no personal 
impressions to draw on, but only conversations with 
friends and political associates of the great man. 
Bismarck, however, it was Dr. White's fortune to 
know long and with some intimacy; consequently 
he is presented with greater fulness and vividness 
than any of the other characters. To the author 
of " The Warfare of Science with Religion " this 
kindred antagonism between unreason and sweet 
reasonableness forms a congenial subject for care- 
ful study and illuminating discussion ; and the work 
is undertaken and executed with a scholarly thor- 
oughness and a contagious enthusiasm that give 
the book both weight and vitality. 

When Mr. Harry Graham christened 
his volume of humorous essays and 
sketches "The Bolster Book" (Duf- 
field), he was humorously apologizing for the absence 
of a quality which in fact particularly distinguishes 
his work. Mr. Graham's worst enemy could not 
accuse him of soporific dullness. He is as lively as 
a cricket, and as irresponsibly, unreasonably cheer- 
ful. His wit is not of a very high order ; it consists 
chiefly in outrageous puns, delightful misquotations, 
daring personalities, and cutting home truths indis- 
tinguishably mixed with wild exaggeration and utter 
nonsense. It plays, apparently with perfect ease, 
upon any subject, from keeping a dog, breakfasting 
in bed, or the dangerous trade of cheese-punching,

evoked from them all, provided only that the 
reader is in a mellow mood, content to be merely 
amused by this stream of desultory banter. The 
tale of Mr. Graham's expensive efforts to "livt- up " 
to the sumptuous appearance of a magnificent fur 
coat will evoke a responsive thrill in the hearts of 
many readers. The incisive analysis of the motives 
and methods of holiday-makers will please others. 
Some of the topics are hackneyed and some of the 
jokes slender, but we doubt if anybody will fall asleep 
over "The Bolster Book." 

The permanent In the meUow maturity of his eighth 
pitaturn decade, the President Emeritus of 

ofexittenct. Harvard has favored us with a vol- 
ume of five essays which readily group themselves 
under the general title, " The Durable Satisfactions 
of Life" (Crowell). This is also the heading of 
the first chapter, a brief address given to the new 
students at Harvard, October 3, 1905, on what 
makes for an honorable and useful life. More 
elaborated, and fitted to the needs of somewhat 
younger hearers, is the next-following lecture on 
''I'lu- Happy Life: The Moral Purpose of the 
Universe," which was first read before the students 
of Phillips Academy, Exeter, N. II., and afterward 
rewritten. Then comes the sketch of "John Gil- 
ley, Maine Farmer and Fisherman," which has 
already appeared in print As a lifelike and thor- 
oughly interesting account of a plain man of the 
people, who was a hero in his humble way, the sketch 
is admirable, and it exhibits the writer's powers in 
a field not habitually occupied by him. Some reflec- 
tions on " Great Riches " come next, and the now 
rather famous lecture on " The Religion of the Fu- 
ture " closes the volume. Dr. Eliot counts health " the 
chief blessing of life after the domestic affections," 
and in his opening page he says : " So far as I have 
seen, there is one indispensable foundation for the 
satisfactions of life health." Yet there have been 
chronic invalids who have conquered for themselves 
some few durable satisfactions of life, perhaps even 
some satisfactions denied to the robust. Encourag- 
ing is the author's conviction that " it is quite unnec- 
essary in this country to feel alarm about the rise 
of a permanent class of very rich people. To trans- 
mit great estates is hard. They get divided or dis- 
persed." In this, as in his other views, Dr. Eliot 
shows himself a confirmed optimist, always taking 
a wide and hopeful outlook, and seeing life in its 
wholeness. 

Memoirs of an Of unusual interest to American 
American-bom readers of autobiographical reminis- 
Prench prince**. cenceg w iu ^ tne volume entitled 

"My Memoirs" (Putnam) which the Princess 
Caroline Murat, granddaughter of the great Murat, 
King of Naples, left unfinished at her death in the 
summer of 1902. She was born in exile, at Borden- 
town, New Jersey, Dec. 31, 1833, her father being 
Prince Napoleon Lucien Charles Murat, and her 
own name Caroline pointing back to her grand- 
mother, Caroline Bonaparte, youngest sister of the 



first Napoleon and consort of the King of Naples. 
A view of the Murat house at Bordentown, from a 
painting by the writer of the Memoirs, forms one 
of the many interesting illustrations in tin- book. 
Restored to the land of her ancestors in 1848. tin- 
Princess again became a wanderer with the down- 
fall of Napoleon the Third, this time choosing Kn- 
gland for her place of exile. That she should have 
cherished for the English no fond affection is not 
surprising, and to this frank dislike of that country 
and all persons and things belonging thereto the 
reader is indebted for some of the spice and snap of 
her outspoken style. She seems to have written. 
however, in the language of that hated land, and 
at the instance of one of its citizens, Mr. Robert 
Leighton, who contributes an introduction to tin- 
volume. Many famous persons appear in her pages, 
notably the Empress Euge'nie, whom she seems to 
have cordially hated, and the Emperor himself, 
whom the kindred blood in her veins made her judge 
more kindly. The fact that the Memoirs were left 
unrevised probably makes them all the better reading, 
as far as human quality is concerned. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The late Alexander Johnston's " History of American 
Politics " (Holt) is a book which it would be difficult to 
improve, but the lapse of time since the last edition has 
made additions necessary, and these have been supplied 
by Professors W. M. Sloaiie and Winthrop More Daniels, 
bringing the work strictly up to date. 

A Bibliography of History for Schools and Libra- 
ries," by Dr. Charles M. Andrews (with two collabor- 
ators), is published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. 
The titles are usefully and intelligently annotated, and 
the book is just what is needed by a teacher of history 
in doubt as to the best books to purchase for the school 
library or for private reading. 

The vexed question of the authorship of "Tiimm <>f 
Athens " is discussed by Dr. Ernest Hunter Wright in 
a monograph recently issued from the Columbia Uni- 
versity Press. The writer makes a strong, and perhaps 
a convincing argument for Shakespeare's priority that 
is, for the view that an unknown author spoiled a play 
largely written by Shakespeare, rather than the view 
that Shakespeare built upon the basis of an earlier 
work. Dr. Wright marshals his evidence in a systema- 
tic and logical fashion, and his style is noticeably better 
than is customary in studies of this description. 

Some there are, perhaps many, who can recall the 
presence among us of the Swami Vivekananda, who was 
an impressive figure at the Parliament of Religions in 
Chicago, in 1893, and who remained in this count c\. 
lecturing in various cities, until 1895, when he pro- 
ceeded to England in further pursuance of his mission, 
returning again to America a little later on his way to 
his own country. "The Master as 1 Saw Him, being 
Pages from the Life of the Swami Vivekananda" 
(Longmans) contains characteristic passages from the 
Swami's teachings, as noted by a devout hearer and sub- 
sequent follower, the Sister Nivedita (Margaret Noble). 
The volume contains much that belongs to all true 
religion, of whatever clime or century.

NOTES. 



Two posthumous volumes of essays by the late Henry D. 
Lloyd are announced by Messrs. Putnam. " Mazzini and 
Other Essays " and " Lords of Industry " are their titles. 

" The Elm-Tree on the Mall," in a translation made by 
Mr. M. P. Willcocks, is a new volume in the John Lane 
Co.'s timely and attractive edition of Anatole France. 

A "History of the French Academy," by Mr. D. 
Maclaren Robertson, is announced by the G. W. 
Dillingham Co. The plan of the work will be biogra- 
phical rather than critical. 

Mr. Arnold Bennett's novel, " Clayhanger," being the 
first volume of a new trilogy with the familiar " Five 
Towns " for a background, will be published Oct. 1 by 
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co. 

A biographical sketch of the late Frederick William 
Mail land has been prepared by Mr. H. A. L. Fisher, 
and will be published by the Messrs. Putnam in con- 
junction with the Cambridge University Press. 

A new edition, revised for the coming year, of Messrs. 
Laird & Lee's well-known "Vest-Pocket Diary and 
Time-Saver " has just made its appearance. A more use- 
ful book, in proportion to its size, would be difficult to 
find. 

" The Function of the Church in Modern Society " is 
to be the title of a new book by Dr. William Jewett 
Tucker, former president of Dartmouth College, which 
is announced by Houghton Mifflin Co., for publication 
this Fall. 

" The Time of the Singing of Birds " is the title of 
an altogether pleasing little anthology of poems about 
birds, published by Mr. Henry Frowde. It is evidently 
the joint work of three compilers, their initials only 
being given. 

" The Forum " will hereafter be published by Mr. 
Mitchell Kennerley. A new and attractive cover appears 
on the September issue, and the contents include con- 
tributions by M. Maeterlinck, Mr. Maurice Hewlett, and 
Count Tolstoy. 

" The Egoist " and " Beauchamp's Career," each in 
two volumes, bring the new " Memorial Edition " 
(Scribner) of George Meredith's writings half-way to 
completion. The illustrations continue to form a fea- 
ture of much interest. 

Messrs. Crowell's excellent series of " Handy Volume 
Classics" has been lately extended by two new vol- 
umes, " Best American Essays " and " Best Amer- 
ican Orations." Both compilations are the work of Mr. 
John R. Howard. 

" The Merry Wives of Windsor," edited from the 
quarto of 1602 by Dr. W. W. Greg, is a publication of 
Mr. Henry Frowde in his " Tudor and Stuart Library." 
The text is a facsimile reprint, and the introduction and 
notes are elaborate. 

Miss Nanette B. Paul is the author of a manual of 
" Parliamentary Law " published by The Century Co. 
An appendix of review questions will serve to test the 
thoroughness with which the reader has mastered the 
contents of the book. 

A new English periodical, " The Librarian," is announ- 
ced, which is to " mirror the state of the library pro- 
fession in this country, and to appeal to the public 
libraries, the great private university and collegiate 
libraries of the United Kingdom. ' The advisory editor 
is Mr. Alexander J. Philip of the Gravesend Public 



Library. The editorial announcement lays stress on the 
fact that the venture is an independent journal, whose 
only purpose is to minister to the tastes of its readers 
and the highest interests of the profession. 

Coleridge's " Poems of Nature and Romance, 1794 
1807," edited by Miss Margaret A. Keeling, is published 
by Mr. Henry Frowde. The edition of 1829 is the basis 
of the present text, although other sources are drawn 
upon to a slight extent. 

The remarkable success of " The New Word " by Mr. 
Allen Upward, lends special interest to the announce- 
ment by Mr. Mitchell Kennerley that he will publish 
immediately a novel by this writer, to be entitled 
" Lord Alistair's Rebellion." 

Two new biographies of Goldsmith are under way in 
England. One of these will be the work of Mr. F. 
Frankfort Moore ; the other, dealing with " Goldsmith 
and his Friends," is by Mr. Richard Ashe King, author 
of a former volume on the same subject. 

" Bernard Shaw as Artist- Philosopher," a brief ac- 
count of the Shavian philosophy prepared by Mr. Rene'e 
M. Deacon, is announced by the John Lane Co. This 
house will also publish a little volume by the artist- 
philosopher himself, to be entitled " Socialism and 
Superior Brains." 

Maxim Gorky has just finished two new plays, and 
arrangements have been made for their production on 
the German stage. The first, which is called "Peculiar 
People," is said to be a bitter satire on Russian society 
in the days following the Revolution. The other is a 
comedy entitled "Children." 

Seven English mystical treatises of the fourteenth 
century, as first collected and printed by Henry Pep- 
well in 1521, are presented in a new volume of the 
"Mediaeval Library" (Duffield), under the title, "The 
Cell of Self-Knowledge." An introduction and notes 
are supplied by Dr. Edmund G. Gardner. 

Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co. publish a 
" Luxembourg " edition of Kingsley's " Hereward the 
Wake," that sterling work of historical romance which, 
we trust, has not yet lost its hold upon young readers. 
There are a dozen or more of rather striking illus- 
trations by Miss Gertrude Hammond. 

Sir Martin Conway's well-known book on the Alps 
is now issued by the Macmillan Co. in a new edition 
costing but one-fourth the price of the original large 
octavo edition illustrated in color by Mr. A. D. Mc- 
Cormick. A number of excellent reproductions from 
photographs illustrate the present issue. 

A " Pocket Reference Library," comprising a number 
of compact pocket-size dictionaries and encyclopaedias, 
printed on India paper, is announced by Messrs. Cassell 
& Co. The first five volumes will be : The Pocket 
Doctor, English Dictionary, Proverbs and Maxims, A 
Dictionary of Mythology, Poetical Quotations. 

Profe sor Lewis A. Rhoades of Ohio State University, 
for many years past a valued contributor to THE DIAL, 
died in Columbus on August 30. He had held the chair 
of Germanic languages and literature at Columbus since 
1903, previous to which time he had been connected 
with the faculties of Michigan, Cornell, and Illinois. 

The discovery among Lafcadio Hearn's papers of a 
translation of Flaubert's " The Temptation of St. 
Anthony" has been recently reported. The book is 
said to have engaged Hearn's attention for several 
years. It will be published before long, with an intro- 
duction by Miss Elizabeth Bisland, Hearn's biographer.

[Sept. 16, 



Miss Bisiand has also edited a farther collection of 
Hearn's Japanese letters, which will be published this 
Fall by Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co. These new let- 
ters contain Hearn's final and frankest expression of 
views in regard to Japan, and are said to be marked by 
a note of disillusion which contrasts sharply with his 
former admiration. 

Three new volumes in the series of " Riverside 
Educational Monographs," published by the Houghton 
Mifflin Co., are the following: " The Ideal Teacher," 
by Professor George Herbert Palmer; "The Problem 
of Vocational Education," by Dr. David Snedden; and 
"The Teacher's Philosophy in and out of School," by 
President William DeWitt Hyde. 

Miss Ida M. Tarbell is now preparing a volume of 
<( Selection8 from Lincoln," which will include the two 
Inaugurals, the speeches in Independence Hall and at 
Gettysburg, the last public address, and the letter to 
Horace Greeley. A brief memoir of Lincoln from the 
pen of Miss Tarbell will add interest to this book, 
which is to be published by Messrs. Ginn & Company. 

Two interesting new volumes in "The Guide 
Series " of books, published by the Baker & Taylor Co., 
are " A Guide to Biography" (American Men of Mind), 
by Mr. Burton E. Stevenson ; and " A Guide to Great 
Cities" (Northwestern Europe), by Miss Esther 
Singleton. Both volumes are illustrated, the one with 
portraits, the other with photographs of buildings and 
street scenes. 

The seventh series of " Shelburne Essays," by Mr. 
Paul Elmer More, which the Messrs. Putnam will 
publish this Fall, contains papers on the following 
subjects : Shelley, Wordsworth, Hood, Tennyson, Will- 
iam Morris, Louisa Shore, Thomas Bailey Aldrich, 
Francis Thompson, the Socialism of G. Lowes Dickinson, 
the Pragmatism of William James, Criticism, and 
Victorian Literature. 

An interesting "human document " is promised in the 
" Life of the late Empress Dowager of China,'' which 
the Lippincotts will publish shortly. This volume was 
compiled from state papers and the private diary of the 
Comptroller of the Empress's household, and also incor- 
porates the diary of His Excellency Ching Shan. The 
author, Mr. J. O. P. Bland, was for several years in the 
Chinese government service under Sir Robert Hart. 

A new volume of eighteenth century studies from Mr. 
Austin Dobson's graceful but frugal pen will be to many 
one of the most interesting announcements of the Fall 
season. The title is " Old Kensington Palace and Other 
Papers," and the contents are described as short studies, 
rather than vignettes, with a larger admixture of literary 
criticism. Though he deals mainly with English scenes 
and personages, Mr. Dobson makes some excursions 
into France. 

The reproduction of the Csedraon MS. in the Bodleian 
is to be undertaken as soon as a sufficient number of 
subscribers have been secured. This MS. of the late 
tenth and early eleventh century is of exceptional inter- 
est, both linguistically and artistically the text is 
illustrated with drawings affording a curious and instruc- 
tive display of the national art and customs of the 
period. The Modern language Association has already 
secured a number of subscribers in this country. 

New light on the ever- fascinating master of Abbots- 
ford is promised in Sir Walter Scott's Friends,'* by 
Mix Florence Mac Cunn, to be published soon by the 
John Lane Company. Alison Rutherford (Mrs. Cock- 



burn), Mrs. Anne Murray Keith, George Cranstoun 
(Lord Corehouse), William Krskine (Ixird Kinneder), 
Anna Se ward, and Joanna Baillie, are among the friends 
described in this volume. An account will be given 
of Scott's relations with other poets, among them 
Campbell, Crabbe, Moore, Byron, and Wordsworth. 

An exceptionally welcome addition to the " Riverside 
Literature Series" (Houghton) is the volume in which 
Professor Clarence Griffin Child has edited for school 
use a group of early English plays, including " Every- 
man," the Towneley "Second Shepherds' Play," the 
Brome " Abraham and Isaac," and several others The 
text is modernized, a change which could hardlv have 
been helped in a book designed for students of the 
lower schools. 

"The Edinburgh Book of Scottish Poetry" is an 
anthology, on a plan similar to the " Oxford Book of 
English Verse " and the " Dublin Book of Irish Verse," 
which is announced for publication in the early autumn 
by Mr. Fisher Unwin of London. The editor, Sir 
George Douglas, has aimed at presenting the best and 
most characteristic work of the Scottish poets, accom- 
panied by notes at the foot of each page, so that the 
reader will not be troubled by linguistic difficulties. 

A number of unpublished letters, written by Carlyle 
and Mrs. Carlyle, have recently been discovered in New 
Zealand, and are now on sale in New York, so that there 
is every likelihood of a further addition to the already 
imposing array of volumes that contain the published 
correspondence of the Carlyles. Mr. Henry Larkin, who 
acted for a time as Carlyle's literary assistant, emigrated 
to New Zealand, taking with him the letters he had 
received from the Carlyles while in England, and it is 
this collection that has now come upon the market. It 
comprises sixty-eight letters written by Thomas Carlyle, 
thirteen by Jane Welsh Carlyle, and fourteen by Ruskin. 

An historical work of considerable importance is 
announced by the Yale University Press in Dr. Max 
Farrand's " Records of the Federal Convention of 1787." 
The proceedings of the convention were held under the 
strictest confidence, and for a period of thirty years no 
word of what took place there was made public by the 
delegates. The variety of versions thereafter published 
shows the need for the present exhaustive work, which 
constitutes the result of years of study on the part of 
the editor, and comprehensively embraces all that has 
been written or published by the various participants 
in the deliberations of the Convention. The work will 
be issued in three royal octavo volumes. There is also 
to be a large-paper Subscribers' Edition, numbered, and 
strictly limited to 250 copies. 

It has been decided to issue two supplementary vol- 
umes to the " Cambridge History of English Literature," 
containing illustrative piimgoi in prose and verse from 
the great English writers, together with many repro- 
ductions of title-pages, portraits, and facsimiles. The 
fifth and sixth volumes of the History, which treat of 
the drama down to the closing of the theatres under 
the Puritan rule, will be published this month. Among 
the contents are chapters by Professor Saintsbury on 
Shakespeare, Professor Gregory Smit!i on Marlowe, 
Mr. F. S. Boas on early English comedy, Professor 
Thorndike of Columbia on Ben Jonson, Mr Arthur 
Symons on Middleton and Rowley, Mr. Harold Child 
on the Elizabethan theatre, and Dr. A. \\ . Ward on 
Thomas Heywood, and on some political and social 
aspects of the Elizabethan age. Messrs. Putnam pub- 
lish the work in this country.

ANNOUNCEMENT LIST OF FALL, BOOKS. 



In accordance with an annual custom of many 
years' standing, we present to our readers herewith 
a complete and classified summary of the books plan- 
ned for publication during the Fall and Winter sea- 
son by the leading publishing houses of America, 
an even fifty in number. This list has as usual been 
prepared especially for our pages, from the earliest 
and most authentic information to be obtained. As 
affording a trustworthy bird's-eye view, as it were, 
of the publishing season of 1910-11, its interest 
and value to every bookbuyer whether librarian, 
bookseller, or private purchaser will be at once 
apparent. About 1650 titles are included in the 
present list, a substantial increase over last year's 
total. All the books entered are new books new 
editions not being included unless having new form 
or matter. Some of the more interesting features 
among these announcements are commented upon 
in the leading editorial in this number of THE DIAL. 
Considerations of space make it necessary to carry 
over to our next issue the categories of " School and 
College Text- Books " and " Books for the Young."

THE DIAL, 



[Sept. 16, 



The One Indispensable 

Medium for Publishers 

of Worthy Books 

HTHIRTY years of continuous publi- 
cation under the same management 
speak for THE DIAL'S stability and 
success. It is preeminently a book 
journal, published solely in the inter- 
ests of the book class, the literary 
and cultivated class, the class that buy 
books. It is issued from the second 
largest city in the country, the centre 
of the immense book-consuming region 
of the Middle West. 



T^HE DIAL is more generally con- 
sulted and depended upon by 
librarians in making up orders for 
books than any other American critical 
journal; it circulates more widely 
among retail booksellers than any 
other journal of its class ; it is the 
accustomed literary guide and aid of 
thousands of private book-buyers, 
covering every section of the country. 



'"THESE facts make THE DIAL indis- 
putably the foremost medium for 
high-grade advertising, the one 
indispensable medium for the publisher 
of worthy books. 



LIBRARY ORDERS 

OUR facilities for promptly and completely filling 
orders from public libraries are unexcelled. Our 
location in the publishing centre of the country enables 
a* to secure Immediately any book not in our very large 
stock. Our many satisfied customers in all parts of the 
United States are our strongest arguments for an oppor- 
tunity to show you how we can fill your orders.

The Leading Book of the Year 
on Church Unity 



The HISTORIC 
EPISCOPATE 

By 
Rev. Robert Ellis Thompson, S.T.D. 

Price, $1.50 net; postage, 11 cents 

u One of the most interesting and illum- 
inating books on the subject. No book 
since Bishop Lightfoot's great essays on 
the Episcopate goes so thoroughly into 
the subject or is so convincing." 

Christian Work and Evangelist. 

" In these days when there is much dis- 
cussion about church union and some 
definite steps have been taken by the Epis- 
copal Church looking to this end, Dr. 
Thompson has touched upon a timely 
topic in the discussion of the Episcopate. 
He handles the subject in an unprejudiced 
manner, giving the arguments for and 
against the doctrine, but shows the fallacy 
of attempting to unite all Christian denom- 
inations on this basis. The work demon- 
strates wide research into this important 
ecclesiastical subject. It gives us in a clear, 
concise form the best that has been said 
throughout the ages on a doctrine held 
essential by many Christians." 

United Presbyterian. 

" Not only very timely, owing to the 
efforts for reunion, but writen with a clear- 
ness and thoroughness that to us is com- 
pletely convincing." Episcopal Recorder.

SIGURD 






A Poem 






By ARTHUR PETERSON 






'"T^HE story of Sigurd, or Siegfried (of which the best-known 






versions are probably the old Nibelungenlied,and Wagner's 






famous tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen), is one of the most 






celebrated of the world's epics. In the following version Sigurd 






is depicted as a young Norse rover, a wanderer not only by land 






but by sea, this latter innovation seeming to lend itself quite 






naturally to the established legend. 






The action takes place about the middle of the fifth century, 






that eventful period which may be said to mark the end of the 






ancient, and the beginning of the modern world. 






The Hon. RASMUS B. ANDERSON, formerly Professor of 






Scandinavian languages in the University of Wisconsin and 






Ex. U. S. Minister to Denmark, says of this book, in a letter 






to the author: 






"The book is a gem. . . . Your language is simply brilliant 






and your metre perfect. What delightful reading ! How I wish 






you would get millions of readers ; for Sigurd and Brynhild are 






our ancestral hero and heroine, and every American lad and lass 






should know the story by heart. You have surely rendered 






the public a distinct service, that should not fail of eminent 






appreciation."

A PEOPLE'S PERSONALITY. 

We all know what personality means when we 
are speaking of the individual ; it is what makes 
a man or woman interesting, although not neces- 
sarily admirable. " Hbchstes Gliick der Erden- 
kinder," Goethe called it, and proclaimed its 
cultivation to be the paramount duty of every 
one of us. In our own time, Ibsen has insisted 
with perhaps excessive vehemence upon its im- 
portance, and has assured us that it is better to 
have a bad character, well-rounded and sharply 
defined, than no distinctive character at all. 
This is also the underlying idea of the individual- 
ist philosophy of such men as Mill and Spencer 
and Lord Morley, who hold that every attempt 
to force individuals into a common mould is a 
step away from progress and in the direction of 
spiritual stagnation. We believe this doctrine 
to be essentially sound, and that the largest 
measure of personal liberty not absolutely antag- 
onistic to the stability of the social order should 
be insisted upon, and jealously defended, by the 
well-wishers of humanity everywhere. Repres- 
sion and coercion should be applied only when 
the necessity for them is established beyond 
question ; in all cases not perfectly clear, the 
individual should be given the benefit of the 
doubt. This position is getting more and more 
difficult of practical maintenance in these days 
of excessive regimentation and insidious social- 
istic theorizing, and it takes a good deal of 
vigilance to hold properly in check the rapidly 
multiplying assaults upon the citadel of in- 
dividualism. 

The preservation, and even the accentuation, 
of the personality of a whole people is probably 
no less important than the similar endeavor in 
the case of the individual, but the problem of 
what constitutes personality in the case of the 
aggregation has many perplexities. It used to 
be thought that the statistical method was ade- 
quate to deal with this problem. Only collect 
enough statistics of all kinds and tabulate them, 
and the character of a people was set down in 
black and white. This is still largely the method 
of the " sociology " which is struggling so hard 
to secure recognition among the sciences, and up 
to a certain point it yields useful results. But 
certain students have recently been at work upon 
what they call " the psychology of the crowd,"

THE DIAL, 



[Oct. 1, 



and their investigations seem to show that the 
character of a large group of people is not quite 
the same thing as the sum total of the characters 
of its separate units. There is perhaps no new 
element, but there is such a suppression here 
and such an emphasis there that the qualities 
which emerge do so with an energy that seems 
disproportionate to the importance of their con- 
stituent items. We get a suggestion as of the 
driving force of a turbine, and a sense of wonder 
that so tremendous a resultant should proceed 
from the pressure of the steam upon such tiny 
blades. It is evident that when the psychology 
of a people is in action as in some social or 
political upheaval we need more than arith- 
metic to account for it, that a more subtle cal- 
culus than the statistician employs is requisite 
for a complete analysis. We have got far 
beyond Buckle in our way of envisaging the 
problems of organized society, and the old cock- 
sureness has given way to a great deal of 
philosophic doubt. 

That there is such a thing as national char- 
acter, that it is possible to make definite propo- 
sitions concerning the personality of a whole 
people, are general opinions to which most of 
us will give some sort of assent, however much 
we may afterwards disagree when it comes to 
actual characterization in a particular instance. 
It is like the problem of Shakespeare as raised 
by certain modern commentators the man 
must have revealed himself in his works, 
but whose vision is clear enough to read the 
revelation with certainty? Hit or-miss character- 
izations of nations are offered us a-plenty, both 
by tourists and arm-chair philosophers. Then 
there are great numbers of conventional judg- 
ments, crystallized into telling descriptive 
phrases, passed on from generation to genera- 
tion, and accepted without close critical inspec- 
tion. The French frivolity, the English arrog- 
ance, the German stolidity, and the Russian 
melancholy, are ascriptions that have just enough 
of truth to pass muster with the superficially- 
minded, but they are subject to so many qualifi- 
cations that little is left of them after a really 
searching analysis. Now and then we find a 
student of national character who really thinks, 
and who has the insight to discern what is es- 
sential and enduring in the people under observa- 
tion. Taine had this faculty in a marked 
degree, and his examination of the English 
temper as expressed in English literature has 
lasting value. Other examples of a truly philo- 
sophical appraisal may be found in such books 
as M. de Vogue's Russian studies, Mr. Have- 



lock Ellis'g " The Soul of Spain," Mr. W. C. 
Brownell's " French Traits," and Professor 
Miinsterberg's " The Americans." Such books 
are genuinely enlightening, and will repay care- 
ful reading. But the majority of judgments 
glibly expressed by our would-be national phy- 
siognomists are the veriest snap-shots, inductions 
from observations that are neither comprehen- 
sive nor penetrating. 

The character of the American people has 
tempted a great many foreigners to display 
their acumen, with results for the most part 
pitifully prejudiced or inaccurate. Nor have 
our own self-appointed critics done much better, 
for they have rarely had an intimate acquaint- 
ance with more than a narrow section of this 
great commonwealth. One may have a fair 
knowledge of the spirit of puritan New England, 
or of the South, old or new, or of the Missis- 
sippi Valley, or of the Pacific Coast, and be 
amazingly ignorant of American life as a whole. 
Possibly there is no such thing as American life 
as a whole, or will be until the ingredients of 
the melting-pot shall have entered into a fusion 
of which there are few signs at present. It is 
true that American society has developed upon 
the basis of a few simple ideas of political and 
social relationships, but abstract ideas may be 
potent in shaping the external life of a nation 
without entering into its temper. Perhaps 
nothing is more noteworthy about our life than 
the lip-service that it pays to the ideals of the 
founders of the nation, and the unconcerned way 
in which it flouts those ideals when they are 
found to run counter to the primal instincts of 
greed and self-sufficiency. We are in theory a 
people devoted to the rights of man and opposed 
to all forms of special privilege ; we are in fact a 
people willing to ride rough-shod over the rights 
of man and to foster privilege by the enact- 
ment of iniquitous laws. Still worse, we are a 
people bound by all our inherited traditions and 
instincts to insist upon the largest measure of 
individual liberty, and yet we bow to the fetich 
of majority rule even when that rule would 
impair the right of contract and go so far as to 
regulate our personal habits. 

These remarks about national character have 
been suggested to us by an article in " The 
Fortnightly Review " which seeks to define 
"The Personality of America." The article 
is absolutely insignificant, but is typical of its 
kind. An Englishman comes to this country, 
spends a few weeks in the four leading cities of 
the Atlantic seaboard, and thinks that he has 
been able * 4 to decipher some real human pages"

of our national life. He discovers that we are 
good-natured and hospitable, that our boots and 
trousers are admirable, that we are clean-shaven 
and boisterously patriotic, and that our girls 
have a good time. By way of criticism, he 
thinks that we work too hard and neglect our 
wives. He learns that Mr. Roosevelt is our 
national hero, and thinks we have done well in 
choosing him for that part. This is a summary 
of the dozen pages of chatter which have been 
dignified with the title quoted above. Breaking 
butterflies is not a task to our mind, and it 
would be ink wasted to enlarge upon the super- 
ficiality and emptiness of this latest contribution 
to comparative sociology. Such articles may be 
useful in helping to keep up the entente cordlale, 
but they have nothing but their good nature to 
recommend them. It is, however, a little sad- 
dening to think how much of this sort of writing 
we get, and how little of the kind that bears 
with it any real message for instruction or 
chastening reproof. And we need both of these 
things if we are ever truly to know ourselves 
and resolutely to set about mending our ways. 



THE TRADITIONS AND THE NEW AGE. 



The New Age is always here. It is always im- 
patient of its predecessors, confident that it is the 
champion of humanity and the culminating epoch 
of the world. It always tries to break with the Past. 
As if it could ! As if the filaments that run through 
it had not their root in the Past, as if its flesh 
were not made and moulded of things gone ! The 
very Doppelganger of the Past, it turns and draws 
its sword upon its own image, threatens it with its 
own force, challenges it in the tones of tradition. 

Are the arts progressive? Science doubtless is, 
though we are much in the dark as to the knowl- 
edge of the ancients. In mechanics, at least, they 
could do things we cannot approach. But the ex- 
tension of scientific knowledge seems unquestionable, 
though even yet we are Newton's children, picking 
up pebbles on the sea-shore. 

Art, however, is the revelation of the human 
spirit, and as far back as we can trace it has revealed 
pretty much the same thing. There are no such 
steps rising one above the other, no such culminat- 
ing growth, in art as in science. Doubtless human- 
ity has never possessed all its faculties complete at 
one time. Doubtless one age has been stronger in 
one form of art- expression than another. There have 
been strange lapses of forgetfulness and sudden 
revivals ; but on the whole there has been main- 
tained a pretty even level. 

The work of antiquity in two of the arts, muic 
and painting, has perished. Its music has been 
doubted, but the literatures of both the Aryan and 



Semitic races are saturated with references to 
music bear witness to their intense delight and 
preoccupation with it. It is hardly conceivable that 
races so intelligent should have been continually 
talking of an art that did not exist. Painting of 
course they had. Some of their wonderful vase 
painting remains, and from the excellence of this 
almost mechanical work we may argue the greatness 
of the real artists. Homer must have seen some 
marvellous work in relief or mosaic before he wrote 
the description of Achilles' shield. In the Hindoo 
poet Bhavabhfiti's drama, "The Latter Acts of 
Rama," the whole of a long act is given up to the 
description of a set of wall paintings, which, if they 
were ever realized, must have rivalled anything in 
modern art. 

But as so little of this past work exists, we are 
driven in these two arts to near comparisons to see 
if the New Age has won out and driven tradition 
from its stronghold. The New Age in painting 
claims landscape for its own. Take, it says, to the 
Past, your figure compositions, your dramas of the 
doings of men and gods ; take your portraits, your 
realizations of the soul of man ; I admit that I do 
not equal you here, but resign the outer world to 
me. Now upon some minds Ruysdael and Hobbema 
and Claude Lorraine, and even Salvator Rosa or 
Richard Wilson, make as strong impressions as the 
modern masters. Their truths are not quite the 
recent truths, but they are true enough for illusion, 
and their pictures bear the stamp of superior minds. 
And the landscape backgrounds of Titian, Rubens, 
Rembrandt, and Velasquez are as magnificent as 
anything in modern art, which indeed they anti- 
cipate in a remarkable degree. Constable, too, is 
not quite a modern, though he is the father of mod- 
ern landscape. 

But the last great French School claims that it 
has brought the sun upon the stage, that it has 
painted light. It has theorized, has brought the 
science of chromatics to its aid, and in practice has 
actually realized the vibration of light. There are 
pictures of Degas and Monet that are absolute incar- 
nations of shimmering, pulsating light. It is not to 
disparage the often splendid work of this school, or 
the pioneer courage which its members displayed, if 
one suggests that much which they have done has 
been anticipated. In Turner's skies we get much 
the same broken vibratory light as in Manet or 
Monet. And that white sky-mud which FitzGerald 
said that Constable's sun threw up on its revolutions 
produces a like effect. There are sketches of Con- 
stable which might be signed by Monet or Seurat. 
Even the "pointillisme" of the latter harks back to 
Canaletto. For ages there have been schools both 
of drawing and engraving based on the use of the 
dot. Many of the Dutchmen, too, have painted 
artificial life as vividly and as truthfully as Degas. 
And there is a wonderful light which, whether truth- 
ful or not, has fascinated the world, in Leonardo's 
" Our Lady of the Rocks" and Rembrandt's " Night 
Watch." The fact is that as a rule we do not

want to paint light, we want to paint solid bodies 
of different hues, densities, and distances, illumined 
with light. Against light-colored backgrounds, 
clouds, white walls or water, the vibrating light of 
the moderns is a success. Against dark backgrounds 
or scenes much involved in shadow, it is a failure. 
And shadow is the soul of painting, as it is of 
literature. 

The use of flat painting is another sign of the 
moderns. But this is no new thing, and was in fact 
learned by them from Velasquez, who sometimes 
paints so thinly that the canvass shows through. 
Scorn of the Subject is another note of recent art. 
But it is pretty hard to escape from the Subject 
The subject of Manet's Dijetiner sur Vherbe is 
what caused the scandal and the persecution of that 
great painter. Whistler laughed at the English 
artist's preoccupation with story, but his own " Lady 
with the Yellow Buskin" is a subject picture. In 
its fugitive motion it embodies the idea of woman 
flying and inviting pursuit If Whistler had painted 
a nude nymph in just that attitude, given a suspicion 
of foliage to the background, and labelled it " Daphne 
flying from Apollo," he would have had a subject 
picture which everyone would have understood. As 
it is, the meaning is cryptically concealed by the 
modern dress. Gainsborough's " Morning Walk," 
though only two portraits, is a subject picture. And 
Constable's "Cornfield" might be labelled Peace " 
or " Fecundity." 

One would not wish to say a word against the 
great modern school of French artists, of whom 
Burne-Jones said that they were noble gentlemen 
working courageously for their ideals without regard 
for success or even for the necessities of life. But 
they are all fragmentary. The great painters of 
the past, Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, are war- 
riors completely equipped, armed cap-a-pie. Each 
of the moderns would seem to have seized a part of 
this equipment a helmet, a breastplate, a lance, 
or a sword; and though each one may have bur- 
nished or sharpened up his piece of hardware beyond 
anything its original owner knew, yet it makes but 
a poor show against the full armament of the 
masters. 

Music is a language that has only two words 
joy and grief. Its lively tones excite and interpret 
the one, its slow and solemn motions the other. But 
just what joy or what grief are associated with the 
notes we must determine for ourselves. Anything 
can be read into their broad expressions. This indef- 
initeness, this resolution of all existence into the 
pulsations of the heart, its systole and diastole, is 
what gives music its universal appeal, and what 
keeps it from having an intellectual content 

Again, a musical phrase is like a syllogism, it 
is a movement that has a beginning, a middle, 
and an end, and that satisfies us with its com- 
pleteness. But to give us two terms of the syllogism 
and withhold the third, or to wrench them violently 
apart, is certainly to deny any such satisfaction. 
Discords are necessary for variety and the shock of 



surprise; making a composition of them can hardly 
be musical. 

But the New Age decided that music must lit* 
dramatic, that it must express and give the exact 
equivalent for the sharply defined thoughts, feelings, 
and actions of humanity. Wagner is the great 
dividing name in music. He thought that pure 
music had reached its climax, and that nothing 
remained for him to do but to invent a new method 
of using tones as a mnemonic exercise. And his 
invention the leit-motif has great merit. Of 
course no succession of notes or chords has any re- 
semblance to a helmet or a sword or the Niblung 
gold; but after certain musical phrases had been 
associated a number of times with these things in 
the action of the drama, the mind of the hearer 
began dimly to appreciate the repetition, and to 
realize the symmetry of the musical architecture. 
It was a little like the game of " hunt the slipper "; 
but once we were trained to the quest, we could 
understand in the Wagnerian work a sort of gigan- 
tic harmony, a titanic thorough bass. Of course, 
with every new work of this kind we have got to 
learn the harmony over again ; and it is at least 
questionable if this repays us as do the legitimate 
forms of music. 

There were six hundred thousand volumes in the 
Alexandrian library. At a mere guess it may be 
doubted if more than a thousandth part of these 
remain. What did the others contain? What song 
did the Sirens sing? No one may know ; but we may 
be sure that, as Tom Moore said of the Irish epics, 
those books were not written by fools or for foolish 
purposes. From what remains we must judge that 
the literature of the ancients subtended as wide an 
arc of experience as our own. Realism and romanti- 
cism were there, and allegory, the most daring 
flights of imagination, the most literal reproduction 
of fact The New Comedy of Athens, if we had it, 
would probably be a fair offset for our whole mass 
of modern novels. And all the forms of literature 
were then invented, drama, epic, novel, tale, lyric, 
idyll. Mr. Burbank may create a new flower or 
vegetable, or we may get a new animal by crossing 
breeds ; but the modern writer may despair of making 
a new form or kind of literature. Whitman aspired 
to this sort of originality. He took the forms of 
literature, which are really its living body, to be 
cerements ; and he essayed to burst these and soar, 
a new thing. But the Greeks had their iin-^ular 
dithyrambic verse. It is a legitimate enough species ; 
though such is the craving of the human mind for 
recognizable form in poetry, for repetition, recur- 
rence, symmetry, that such shapeless verse has 
never made any wide appeal. Blake, who anti- 
cipated Whitman in the use of it. as he did to a 
great extent in thought, has never been mm-h read. 
Nor has the irregular lyrical blank verse of Milton 
and Matthew Arnold. Probably the most popular 
thing Whitman ever wrote is the little lyric. My 
Captain," which comes nearer than anything else of 
his to recognized models of metre and rhyme. 



1910.] 



THE DIAL, 



The genius of a language when in its formative 
period can and does create new forms. Modern 
accented verse differs from the quantitative poetry 
of the ancients, and each modern race has developed 
special and favorite variations of its own, as the 
assonance of the Spanish, the alliteration of Scan- 
dinavian and Celtic poetry, the alexandrine in 
French, and the heroic line in English. 

The real originality of every writer lies in the 
glow and movement and vibration of his spirit. If 
these are vivid and rapid they will certainly differ- 
entiate him from all others, though he make no 
effort for originality of thought or newness of form. 
The stronger they are, indeed, the more probability 
that he will accept the dower of the past, will 
take what tradition gives him, in order to ease him 
in his work. 

Let us deal kindly with tradition, and tradition 
will be good to us. Let us not try to push our grand- 
sires from their thrones. Rather, if it is necessary 
to save them, let us bear them tenderly on, as the 
pious ^Eneas carried old Anchises from the wreck 
of burning Troy. 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



A CHINESE STUDENT'S REASONABLE REQUEST 
that irritating and time- wasting formalities at the 
port of arrival should be waived in the case of those 
seekers for knowledge now coming in considerable 
numbers from China to the colleges and universities 
of our land, appears in a New York journal. The 
oriental courtesy and dignity and restraint that 
mark the style of the letter (and that incidentally 
remind one of the gentle phraseology of the author 
of " A Japanese Artist in London," elsewhere re- 
viewed in this issue) are highly ingratiating. We 
quote a passage, which will point its own moral : 
" I am sorry to confess that my first impression as 
I reached America was unpleasant. In order that 
the students who enjoy the benefit of the kindness 
of the United States in returning the indemnity 
money may not at the moment of their arrival 
experience the same disagreeable sensation, in 
order that no germ of hatred may arise in the proud 
hearts of these young men coming here for training 
for important offices in the New China, I plead for 
more simplicity and less restraint in the forms 
through which they are required to go upon arrival. 
These forms detained me in San Francisco against 
my will for some thirty-six hours, and were it not 
for subsequent kindness shown me, I fear that 
I should have kept a while here, and later on 
carried back to China, hatred instead of friendship 
and good feeling toward America." Let us take a 
few lessons in manners from the East while we are 
trying to give lessons in some perhaps less important 
departments. 



HOW TO MAKE THE BOOK-FUND GO THE FUR- 
THEST, whether in buying for a public or for a 
private library, is often a question of great impor- 
tance. As a help in answering it, Mr. Le Roy 
Jeff ers's " List of Editions Selected for Economy in 
Book Buying," published by the American Library 
Association, may profitably be consulted. The com- 
piler's experience as " Chief of Book Department" 
of the New York Public Library enables him to 
deal intelligently with the matter, and his nineteen 
double-column pages embrace a range of works in 
polite literature that would alone constitute a re- 
spectable library for a small town, and a more than 
respectable library for an individual. It is surpris- 
ing how many good books, well printed and well 
bound, can be had at fifty cents each, with a liberal 
discount in the case of public libraries, while for 
sixty and seventy-five something approaching to 
luxury is at one's command. In some points of 
detail Mr. Jeffers's list is a little puzzling. Why, 
for instance, does he give only a very few of the 
excellent " Astor " editions of the standard poets ? 
Matthew Arnold and George Eliot we find, but 
many others, far more likely to be in demand, as 
Milton, Byron, Scott, Shelley, and Keats, appear 
only in more expensive editions. Again, why enter 
George Eliot and George Sand under their pseudo- 
nyms, with cross-reference to their real names, but 
compel the reader to turn back from u Twain, 
Mark," to " Clemens, S. L." ? However, the little 
pamphlet is of such worth, and, in its way, of such 
interest that one ought to enjoy turning its leaves 
the oftener the better.

THE IMMORAL NOTE IN FICTION cannot be de- 
scribed in definite terms and thereafter invariably 
recognized from the description. Nevertheless a 
sensible reply to the question, " What Makes a 
Novel Immoral?" has recently been written by 
Miss Corinne Bacon of the Newark (N. J.) Public 
Library ; and her article, originally published in 
"New York Libraries," has been reprinted in the 
" Wisconsin Library Bulletin." Its breadth of view 
is worthy of all praise, as a few random citations 
will prove. " A novel may have nothing objection- 
able about it, so far as its love affairs go, and yet be 
a thoroughly immoral book. For morality includes 
the whole of life not simply one relation." " The 
sinful woman in the Scarlet Letter is a healthier 
companion than the blameless Pamela." "The book 
which degrades our intellect, vulgarizes our emo- 
tions, kills our faith in our kind, is an immoral 
book : the book which stimulates thought, quickens 
our sense of humor, gives us a deeper insight into 
men and women and a finer sympathy with them, 
is a moral book, let its subject-matter have as wide 
a range as life itself." Is it not the two-edged 
quality of all criticism that makes the censorship of 
fiction so odious a task ? '' To the pure all things 
are pure," is the disconcerting rejoinder to the one 
who has carefully run a novel through his moral

trainer and caught a few real or fancied impurities. 
And, furthermore, here as elsewhere in literature. 
what is one man's meat is another man's poison 
except that of course there are some books too 
indubitably bad to be other than poisonous to all 
readers. , , . 

THE SENSUOUS BEAUTY IN WORDS might be dis- 
coursed on at great length. "The Westminster 
Gazette " has been conducting a sort of symposium 
on the subject of the most beautiful words in En- 
glish and other languages, and of course examples 
of such mysteriously haunting vocables have been 
forthcoming in abundance. Who shall say what it 
is in sounds, sights, tastes, and smells, that conveys 
the impression of beauty or of ugliness, of sweetness 
or of sourness, of softness or of harshness, and why 
it does so? The quality of beauty is one, but its 
manifestations are countless. In the case of words, 
this appeal of the mere sound to the ear is too often 
drowned in the associations attached to the word. 
But in a comparatively unfamiliar tongue, as the 
American Indian dialects are to most of us, the 
unmodified effect of sounds on the ear and on the 
inner sense can be studied. Are there any more 
beautiful words than some of those selected by Long- 
fellow for poetic uses in his "Song of Hiawatha"? 
What, for example, could be more liquidly musical 
than the word Minnehaha " ? Or what invitation 
could fall more gratefully on the city-dweller's ear, 
on a sultry summer day, than one bidding him step 
on the magic carpet of Prince Housain and be trans- 
ported to the Falls of Minnehaha? Even though 
he never heard of the Falls of Minnehaha, what 
fragrantly moist and musical delights, what coolness 
and shady freshness, what babble of laughing waters, 
are immediately suggested ! 



TWO INSTANCES OP INTELLECTUAL PRECOCITY 

that have attracted some attention of late raise again 
the old question whether such abnormal development 
of mental powers at a very early period furnishes 
promise of later remarkable achievement, or is rather 
an ominous symptom and one to be dreaded by par- 
ents. The children in question, who need not here 
be specified by name, are the boy wonder of Har- 
vard, and the eight-year-old San Francisco prodigy 
who already speaks seven languages and has now 
begun on that simulacrum of a language, Esperanto. 
Dr. Andrew D. White in his latest book, "Seven 
Great Statesmen," has a disparaging word to say of 
those precociously learned young men who so com- 
monly sink later, under the weight of their acquisi- 
tions, into everlasting obscurity. But his selected 
statesmen were rather noted for early display of 
unusual powers of intellectual acquisition. The 
difficulty in such an inquiry as this lies in the fact 
that, as a rule, only the infant prodigies who have 
** made good " are available for purposes of investi- 
gation, while the possible thousands who have failed 
to fulfill their early promise have left no record 
behind them. We shall watch with interest for any 



future achievements in the literary or learned world 
on the part of the two children whose present men- 
tal equipment is so far above the average. 



EYE-STRAIN AMONG LIBRARIANS ought next to be 
made the subject of special study, and of a special 
volume, by Dr. Gould of Philadelphia, who has -o 
zealously pursued his quest for eye-strain and it* 
attendant ills among various sorts of learned and 
literary workers. In a paper on the recreations of 
librarians prepared for the recent Mackinac meeting 
by Mr. Samuel H. Ranck, of the Grand Rapids Pub- 
lic Library, but crowded out of the programme, to 
the regret of many, he had this to say among other 
things: "I believe that the beginning of the dis- 
organization of the nervous system among librarians 
is frequently due to eye-strain. I have seen many 
examples of this where nervous indigestion, leading 
up to nervous prostration, and all the ills that follow, 
began with eye-strain. Library work and library 
lighting can easily make all of us victims of eye- 
strain ; and I may add that the lighting in many of 
our libraries is vicious." Significant, in this con- 
nection, is the large number of library workers wear- 
ing glasses whom one sees in our public libraries. 
Nowhere else, except perhaps in a German univer- 
sity lecture-room, will one find so many be-spectacled 
pairs of eyes. ... 

THE VOGUE OF OUR LAMENTED PRAGMATIST, the 
late William James, has never before been brought 
home to us as it has since his death. From all 
parts of Europe, as well as from every quarter of 
our own country, come evidences of the esteem in 
which he was held, the extent to which he was read, 
and the measure of his influence on the lives and 
the thinking of his readers. Noting the keen regret 
in London over his death, a correspondent ventures 
the assertion that no philosophical writer of the 
present generation has been so widely read. The 
far-reaching and beneficial influence of his doctrine 
of " what works " in breaking down senseless con- 
vention, in overthrowing dogmatism, and in under- 
mining prejudice, is immeasurable. " Modernism " 
in religion, the reform of our penal system, and the 
radical tone of much recent legislation, must all 
owe something, however indirectly, to the growth 
and spread of the pragmatic habit of mind ; and 
most who have caught the habit have done so from 
his books, magazine articles, and reported utter- 
ances. His was a message that seems likely to be 
delivering itself to future ages long after the name 
of William James himself shall have been forgotten. 
. . 

THE LIBRARIAN WHO WRITES is probably in 
more perilous case than the librarian who reads. 
"The librarian who reads is lost," runs the aneinit 
adage; and any who desire an illustration of its 
truth should turn to "The Old Librarian's Alma- 
nack" and see there what befell the admirable 
Timothy Mason, a librarian whose love for the in- 
sides of his books exceeded his love for their out-

sides. Among the writing librarians must be in- 
cluded the late Leopold Delisle, whose custody of 
the literary treasures of the Bibliotheque Nationale 
ended a few weeks ago with his death at Chantilly. 
So prolific a writer was he that the number of his 
books and learned treatises, with the works edited 
and annotated by him, runs up to nearly two thou- 
sand 1889 more exactly. A complete bibliography 
of his literary labors is said to fill a volume of more 
than five hundred pages. But the librarian in him 
came so near to being lost in the author and scholar 
that his administration of the famous library under 
his care was adversely criticized by more than one 
student who had occasion to use it. In view of 
Delisle's long and ardent devotion to his literary and 
learned labors, it is not surprising that the French 
National Library should now be far less ably man- 
aged than the library of the British Museum, which 
in turn cannot compete with our great American 
libraries in practical efficiency as a public institution. 



THE LEFFERTS COLLECTION OF POPE'S WORKS 
which has recently been presented to the Harvard 
University Library, through the generosity of an 
unnamed benefactor (presumably Mr. J. Pierpont 
Morgan), contains more than five hundred volumes, 
none of later date than 1751, when Warburton's 
complete edition was published, and is the largest 
collection of first and other early editions of Pope in 
existence. It was brought together by Marshall C. 
Lefferts, the bibliophile, whose fond hope it was to 
acquire a copy of every early edition of every one 
of the poet's works. But forced in his old age to 
recognize the impossibility of accomplishing his 
object, he decided to sell the collection, and it was 
placed in the hands of Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co., 
from whom it has now been bought and given to 
Harvard, which already had about one hundred and 
fifty Pope volumes in addition to the Lefferts lot, 
so that its present equipment in the editions of that 
poet's works is unequalled in this country and, one 
might confidently assert, in the world. 


AN OCTOGENARIAN COLLEGE STUDENT who has 

already attracted our admiring attention, and who 
is undoubtedly the only undergraduate of eighty 
now climbing the hill of knowledge with the inten- 
tion of completing the four years' course and of 
following it with post-graduate study, is Mrs. Amy 
D. Winship of Racine, Wisconsin, widow of the 
late E. B. Winship of the Winship Manufacturing 
Company. This eighty-y ears-young-collegian (she 
is now a sophomore, apparently) is enrolled at 
the Ohio State University, whence a press despatch 
announces her chosen studies for the coming winter 
to be philosophy, psychology, and literature, with 
Shakespeare for a specialty. Not content with the 
regular college year of work, she attends summer 
school in the long vacation. No wonder she is 
reputed one of the best-read women in Wisconsin, 
as well as one of the closest students. 



THE TRAVELLING LIBRARIES OF WISCONSIN now 

go to some nine hundred towns, or " stations," as 
they are called in a well-written and well illustrated 
pamphlet ("Traveling Libraries in Wisconsin, with 
Directory of Stations " ) compiled by Miss Lutie E. 
Stearns, chief of this department of educational 
activity in that energetic commonwealth. It appears 
that the state and the county systems together own 
nine hundred and forty-four of these peripatetic 
collections, with a total of nearly forty-five thousand 
volumes, and that only lack of funds prevents a still 
more extensive circulation of much-desired reading 
matter. Travelling study libraries, for study clubs, 
together with typewritten outlines for guidance, go 
also to the more serious-minded communities. A 
map that forms the frontispiece to the little pamphlet 
shows that nearly all the counties are well studded 
with " stations," no county being entirely neglected, 
and even the lonely lumber camp receiving an 
appreciated attention. As fore-runner to the per- 
manent library, its itinerant substitute is doing a 
good work. 



COMM UN 1C A TIONS. 



THE JOURNALIZED SHORT STORY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In a recent number of " The Athenaeum " a writer, 
who signs himself L. N., heartily complains of the 
abuse of the short story in England. Editors, so he 
asserts, have desired " force and body," both of a physi- 
cal kind, writers have been weak enough to respond, 
and, as a result, that desirable kind of short story which 
does perfectly what in so brief a space can be perfectly 
done, has gone down before condensed novellettes cram- 
med with stereotyped incident and machine-made char- 
acters. As a touchstone to test the inferiority of the 
contemporary product, he brings forward Scott's 
" Wandering Willie s Tale," and so concludes a criti- 
cism which deserves circulation on this side of the 
water. 

It deserves circulation here, whatever its truth for 
England, because it describes admirably the vulgarizing 
of the short story by the new American magazine. 

The new magazine we all know, and, within limits, 
admire. It is active, it is thoroughly contemporary ; if 
one is looking for news it is interesting ; it is read to 
an extent which is astonishing or appalling according to 
one's point of view. The pamphlets of the eighteenth 
century were not more effective politically. But it is 
not a magazine. 

A magazine is specifically a storehouse of literature, 
or of writing which aspires to be literature. But the 
new so-called magazine is not so to be described. Ex- 
cluding the poetry, which remains as a survival, and, in 
some measure, the short stories, it is sheer journalism, 
as a rule good journalism. Far from representing, as 
some pessimists think, the decline of the old magazine, 
it is actually a step forward in the perfection of the 
newspaper. Its leading articles make little attempt to 
refine upon life as literature must ; on the contrary, their 
purpose is to emphasize, as journalism should, the 
" features " of the month's events. The new periodical 
accomplishes its end. It accomplishes it so well that it

THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1. 



has robbed the dailies of some of their popularity and 
much of their influence. Only the narrow-minded will 
criticise it because it is journalistic instead of literary, 
or will insist that it should become a true magazine. 

But, unfortunately, these extra-illustrated newspapers 
insist upon feeding the hungry for news and the hungry 
for art oat of one ladle. As the dress-coat has kept the 
sword button, so these periodicals have retained certain 
appurtenances of the literary magazine, namely, 
poetry and the short story. The poetry was so inef- 
fective that a great change in setting has only narrowed 
its already straitened province. But the short story has 
been the sweetening, the ballast, the most popular ele- 
ment of the new magazine, and, inevitably, it has been 
journalized. 

The symptoms of the journalized short story are 
easily distinguished. Lack of style is the most evident, 
and this probably means a failure to mature the thought, 
to ripen the character-study, to drive observation 
beneath the drift of occasional happenings. It would 
be easy to name twenty short stories of the last decade 
in America that lack only style to be perilously near 
greatness. Sensationalism, which after all is only ex- 
aggeration and therefore bad art, is another symptom. 
The journalized short story roars its laughter, bellows 
its pathos, shouts its strenuosity. Or it is crudely 
realistic, smeared with local color, stuck over with a 
specialized slang or rare dialect, all in the attempt to 
make the thing " go " with hasty readers, to give it a 
u challenge," as the magazine people say. An overplus 
of " body " is probably a symptom also. By overplus 
of " body " the " Athenaeum " writer means a crowding 
of incident, an accumulation of climaxes, a stringing 
together of vivid episodes, so that the purchaser shall 
feel that he is getting his money's worth of fiction. But 
this fault is more English than American. Since Irving, 
Poe, and Hawthorne began the cultivation of the fine 
short narrative among us, the American sense for what 
should and should not go into a short story seems to have 
been keener and truer than the English. Kipling and 
Stevenson are exceptions, but then the one studied Bret 
Harte, the other Hawthorne. Such clever craftsmen 
as Mr. Galsworthy and Mr. Hewlett will blur the lines 
of a short story whose technique a much lesser American 
would handle with skill, while even the journalistic 
short stury is usually well constructed and duly limited 
in scope when it appears in an American magazine. On 
the other hand, if journalism has not affected our tech- 
nique it has certainly drawn the short story into the 
service of the propaganda which gave the new magazine 
its reason for being and its success. These journalistic 
stories smell of the muck-rake. Too often a strained 
plot and a warped character-study show that they are 
cut to fit a popular movement, or made to order for the 
illustration of some social or political defect. 

So far we can hug the Englishman's grievance to our 
breasts, and, if that is any satisfaction, feel that " L. N." 
would add fire, salt, and vinegar to his strictures if he 
could but spend an hour over a Subway news-stand. And 
yet, however just his words may be for England, and 
however truly they apply to our journalized short stories, 
there is one group of American narratives which they 
misfit in an almost ludicrous fashion. I do not mean 
the thoroughly good short stories which, in spite of all 
evil tendencies whatsoever, are being written here more 
numerously and, I believe, more excellently than in 
England. I mean the feminized short story. The

servative monthlies which still deserve the name of 
magazine. A pale, faint creature this, usually tinged 
with the local color of some rural neighborhood, or puls- 
ing gently to the flow of a pathetic sentiment. I >rlu .i<-\ 
is carried to the verge of emptiness, suggestiveness to 
a point where nothing interesting is suggested, the 
"spiritual body," for which our English critic asks, 
is attained by starving the physical. The authors and 
editors of such stories are, after all, less dangerous than 
the journalists they have at worst emasculated an 
art which should be delicate and graceful, though strong. 
But they have rendered bad service to the cause of fic- 
tion, for they have led many readers to associate a 
literary touch with effeminacy and tonelessness, with the 
tale of a dull farm, and a faded old woman who looks 
through dingy curtains and talks dully. Such tales, 
since they are literary but unsuccessful, have left open 
the way for an unliterary narrative which, thanks to a 
similitude of vigor and masculinity, has attained a con- 
siderable if not a meritorious success. They must share 
the blame for the journalized short story. 

An American, however, who sought to escape from 
these unfortunate tendencies, would scarcely instance 
Wandering Willie's Tale " as an example of what one 
would advise our tellers of short stories to be doing. 
Much water has run under the bridges since Scott wrote 
the Tale. It has the worthy and sufficient style which 
many of our stories, for lack of maturity, are wanting 
in. It is written with that subtle interweaving of strand 
and strand of the narrative which makes consummate art. 
But the mode of its telling is the straightforward, in- 
cident-by-incident fashion of Chaucer and Boccaccio. 
In English, to judge by the scarcity of great successes, 
this has always been a difficult mode for the short story, 
I do not know why. And surely, for the situations or 
impressions out of which we make so many of our mod- 
ern short stories, the difficulty is enormously increased. 
It would seem that we must grapple with such material 
for stories, in the majority of instances, by means of 
the technique which Poe gave us, the technique which 
bends every word towards the end of the story, and 
arranges tone, setting, and succession of incident so as 
to throw all emphasis upon the situation or impression 
which is subject and conclusion of the narrative. This 
technical method is surely not to be neglected when, in 
America certainly, hundreds can use it successfully. 
Nor is it to be neglected because thousands are carrying 
it into abuse. 

In all probability it is the likeness of this method of 
story-telling to the methods of the journalists which 
accounts for the ready abuse. Poe developed this tech- 
nique in search of the power of vividness and immedi- 
ate effect which journalism, for other purposes, likewise 
desires. Under the whip-lash of demand our moderns 
seem to be taking it from literature to give it to jour- 
nalism. But if so, the cry for the writers of the American 
short story is not back to the technique of Scott, or to 
any technique whatsoever. It is rather back to litera- 
ture, and all that literature implies of style, of worthi- 
ness, and of art. Only so can they hope to gather 
immortelles from an age which offers unexampled op- 
portunities for the keenly-poised, carefully-wrought 
short story. Otherwise they will be swung along in 
the wake of the extra-illustrated newspaper, their 
stories, like canoes lashed to a steamer's stern, strained 
and sprung out of art, out of beauty, and out of grace.

THE WRITING OF HISTORY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

A half-century ago, Macaulay, as essayist and his- 
torian, if not as poet, was all the vogue. Indeed, one 
might say simply as historian; for most of his essays 
were on historical subjects, and his very poems were 
historical. 

In several of his essays he had set forth, years before 
he undertook his great historical task, his conception of 
what a history should be. In the main he worked up to 
this ideal, and the result was at the time truly marvel- 
lous. His history was more entertaining than most of 
the novels of the day, and was read with enthusiasm all 
over the English-speaking world. His clear-cut and 
vigorous style, as lucid as Voltaire's French and often 
as caustic, made reading easy and stimulating to the 
weariest minds. His rich allusiveness to the whole 
known world of literature flattered and delighted those 
whose general reading permitted them to catch the force 
and aptness of the allusions, and piqued the curiosity 
of those who failed to comprehend them. The vastness 
of his knowledge inspired confidence in his judgment; 
and his very cocksureness his greatest foible was 
to many minds a steady support against doubt and 
vacillation. His own enthusiastic optimism was in 
keeping with the spirit of the age, unaffected as yet to 
any great extent by the vaticinations of Carlyle and 
Rusk in; and he might be said to have found myriads 
of disciples ready-made, holding his own doctrines and 
only too glad to have them confirmed and ratified by so 
plausible a reasoner and set forth by so vivid a narrator. 

He died, and speedily the reaction came. His imi- 
tators had made that facile, forcible, uncompromising 
style a disgust to many. Truth, they argued, could not 
possibly be so direct and unmistakable; there must be 
limitations, modifications, exceptions to almost any state- 
ment. Besides, science had then captured the attention 
of the public and wholly absorbed it. Darwin, Wallace, 
Spencer, Huxley, and their followers, were directing the 
forms and the trend of thought. A craze for explaining 
everything by scientific analysis and in terms of evolu- 
tionary progress had seized upon the whole thinking and 
reading world, and it was seriously believed that history 
could be made a science. There are some who still 
cherish the delusion. 

Buckle set himself to working the environment hy- 
pothesis. Taine explained literature by climate; Free- 
man, Stubbs, Creighton, Gardiner swore by documents, 
and pretty well eliminated the personal human element. 

The new school of Kterary expression also turned its 
back on Macaulay. His method was rhetorical. The 
younger writers, at the head of whom was Matthew 
Arnold, disdained rhetoric, and devoted themselves to 
critical analysis. They drowned their thought with an 
endless tangle of modifications. Those who still stood 
by rhetoric looked on Macaulay's style as crude and 
sometimes cacophonous, and aimed at effects which we 
call, after the French, " precious." Of these were 
Walter Pater and Robert Louis Stevenson. 

Well, what has been the result? Perhaps we have 
greater exactness as to facts, in many cases new points 
of view, a more cautious summing up of the evidence; 
but nowhere is the clear and flowing current of narra- 
tive, the allurement of style, the wonderful touch of art 
in the presentation of truth. Many modern historical 
studies put before us merely ill-digested chunks of 
material the material for history, not history itself. 



Every crude investigator imagines himself a historian, 
when he is nothing but a miner digging out facts; and 
his facts are either meaningless or else make a wrong 
impression from lack of proper contrast, relief, or per- 
spective. Every artist knows that there is no greater 
liar than the sun; but the camera-fiends do not know 
this, and cannot be brought to understand it. 

The student of history on a large scale knows that 
it can never be a science. Research is admirable, but 
one may have done excellent work in that line and yet 
be perfectly incapable of turning into history the mate- 
rial that he has so industriously gathered. This is what 
has happened in the case of most of the joung doctors 
turned out by our higher institutions of learning, under 
the lead of the Germans. It is deplorable that they 
should have been taught to believe that their theses 
were both science and history, when in point of fact 
they were neither. 

It is about time that the writers of history should 
return to the spirit and methods of Macaulay ; that 
they should try at least to do their digesting of docu- 
ments before they begin their real work, and then should 
seek to acquire some skill in the use of his variety of 
statement, his art in emphasis, his illuminating allusive- 
ness, his compass of view, his sense of perspective, his 
sweep and flow of coherent narrative, and, above all, his 
capacity to breathe into his characters the breath of life. 

The historical writers who superseded Macaulay 
accused him of partisan bias, and prided themselves 
on their own impartiality. There can be no doubt that 
their charge against Macaulay was well-grounded; but 
neither have they succeeded in writing without bias. No 
thinking man can be wholly impartial ; and since this is 
so, better a thousand times that a writer having the 
defect of partisanship should also have the divine gifts 
of the writer who can make the Past live again for those 
who read his pages. Macaulay not only does this, but 
he hangs that Past of which he writes upon the chain 
of human historic development, and links us with the 
remotest Past of the historic nations, giving us a sense 
of continuity that assures us of our being a part of the 
Divine Plan. His optimism reaches back as well as 
forward, and is in its essence a true philosophy of life. 
His ordered thought on the historic sequence of events 
has for its foundation recorded facts; for its buttresses 
the steadiness of law; for its columns, capitals, and 
arches, the charm of art; and for its inner adornment 
the innumerable delights of literature.

SAN FRANCISCO'S PUBLIC LIBRARY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

We appreciate the favorable comment on the San 
Francisco Library which appeared in the September 1 
issue of THE DIAL, but we have accomplished a little 
more than you give us credit for. Instead of three 
branches we have six in operation, and in addition there 
are eleven deposit stations. 

The " pig-tail " has been seen in the public library 
here, though most of the educated Chinese have adopted 
American customs. Our reference room is not infre- 
quently visited by this class for purposes of study, and 
they usually call for the best class of books. Very many 
of the Japanese avail themselves of the resources of 
the Library, but for serious purposes rather than for 
recreation. WM. R. WATSON, Librarian.

A CHILD OF Tin OKMNT ix THE TURMOIL, 
OF LONDON." 

Of the exquisite art and captivating artless- 
ness of Mr. Yoshio Markino something is already 
known from his three large color books, " The 
Color of London," " The Color of Paris," and 
" The Color of Rome," to each of which the 
illustrator's own pen has added a single chapter 
of even more arresting quality than the beautiful 
pictures themselves. And now he has written 
an entire book, " A Japanese Artist in London," 
which is the richest possible treat of its kind. 
Mr. Wallace Irwin, in his mirth-provoking 
44 Letters of a Japanese Schoolboy," has some- 
what familiarized American readers with the 
peculiar idiom of the visitor from Dai Nippon 
attempting to give in English his impressions of 
the West ; but the studied drollery of that book 
must yield precedence to the simple and spon- 
taneous comicality of Mr. Yoshio Markino's 
style. It was a rather difficult task for me 
to go on for a whole book with my terribly 
deformed English," he confesses, " but my 
English friend has so kindly dragged me all 
round to reach the finishing point." 

These humorously pathetic pages from his 
own life begin with a brief account of the writ- 
er's harsh experience of Calif ornian in hospitality 
in San Francisco, where he arrived as a mere 
lad from Japan in the summer of 1893, and 
where he stayed four years, having run away 
from home " with a hope to become a poet or a 
writer in English." But the difficulties of the 
language in which he had hoped to write his 
way to fame soon led him to take the advice of 
friends and turn artist. 

44 So I entered into Hopkins' Art College. Of course 
I was penniless. I had to make livelihood by washing 
windows and dishes, or a little better thing, making sets 
of false teeth for some dentists. It was awfully difficult 
for me to pay my school tuition, seven dollars a month. 
. . . The school used to supply French breads to the 
students for the purpose of charcoal drawing. But I 
used to live on this bread. I made it as my luncheon 
every day. (This is the very first time that I confess 
the truth. Thank Heaven that the curator did not find 
out!) 

" I was rather amused with my poor life, but by no 
means did I feel pleasant with the way those Californians 
treated me. It is the world-known fact that they hate 
Japanese. While I have been there four years I never 
went out to the parks, for I was so frightened of those

when I was walking on the street the showers of pebbles 
used to fall upon me often. And I was spat on more 
occasionally. Of course they were very low-class peo- 
ples, but even better-class peoples had not a very nice 
manner to the Japanese." 

What a change from all this to the compar- 
ative cordiality of London ! " Nobody shouted 
me," relates the new-comer with surprise. 
44 Then I went near the crowds of people with 
still more fear. But being quite ignorant of the 
English civilization I anticipated some pebble- 
showers every minute." None came, however, 
and ere long we find him rejoicing in the safety 
of London streets, even in the dead of night, 
when he frequently sallied forth in quest of new 
impressions and novel artistic effects. Devoted 
to his art, he scorned delights and lived labori- 
ous days, or, as he expresses it, he 44 rejected 
the comfortable life." The shifts to which In- 
was reduced to keep body and soul together 
must have been far less amusing to experience 
than they are to read about. Compelled at 
one time to accept the position of designer to a 
tombstone manufacturer, he suffered his admira- 
tion for the beauty of English women to affect 
his stone angels, turning them all to the sex 
where, etymologically, they do not belong ; and 
so he lost his place, and was reduced, as often 
both before and afterward, to penniless poverty, 
as he describes it, and to the position of a starv- 
ing unemployee. 44 But only one thing was," 
says this son of a family that could trace its 
lineage back for a thousand years, 44 1 could not 
ask any disgraceful money like chips [tips ?] or 
charity. Even in my hardest time, it seemed to 
me the Samurai spirit of my dead father above 
was always demanding me, 4 Keep your own dig- 
nity.* " The guilelessness of the young artist 
was more than once imposed upon by unscrupu- 
lous publishers, and he was both saddened and 
made to suffer hunger by this dishonorable con- 
duct. Comparing the spirit of the two coun- 
tries, England and Japan, he writes : 

The Soul of Old Japan is Honor, and the soul of 
England is business. For the sake of Honor many 
Samurais had dend-lieat duels with thi-ir dran-M friend-. 
and for the sake of Honor the fathers often stabbed 
their children unto death. In England Business has 
the power almost the same witli Honor in .Japan. I 
often notice my English friends change their expression 
and knock the table with their fists and say, ' Ah, but 
this is Business.' For business ' laughter gets serious, 
drunkards get sober, friends quarrel, and lovers depart 
each other. English husbands would bring their wives 
to the court, all for the business matter. Of course I 
know that English peoples do much for Honor also, but 
in Japan it is only the merchants who do the business, 
while in England it may be that even Princes have 
business."

Another passage, showing the writer's atti- 
tude toward the religion of his adopted country, 
furnishes matter for thought : 

" One day those friends of hers [of Mrs. Dryhurst] 
surrounded me and asked me how was about the religions 
in Japan. That was a very difficult question to me. It 
is fact that I was at an American Missionary College in 
Japan and studied the Bible lessons for four years. But 
among us, the young schoolboys, the Christians were 
looked down as ' not highly educated.' I think the main 
reason was that those terribly ignorant and uneducated 
American missionaries in Japan were talking and doing 
too much nonsences. While I was in America when 
anybody asked me if I were a Christian I always an- 
swered negatively to prove that I was not one of those 
' Uneducated.' But to my astonishment I was entirely 
knocked down. They called me ' Pagan ' and ' Heathen ' 
and ' Barbarian,' and they treated me as if I were not a 
human. Fancy ! that one whose duty is supposed to be 
' to seek the lost sheep ' should act himself not at all 
humanly ! " 

But his English friends, on this occasion, 
applauded him when at last he mustered courage 
to declare his loyalty to Laotze, Confucius, and 
Mencius, his "very best sweethearts in this 
world," as he calls them in his book. " I do 
not worship them as gods," he adds, " but I 
heartily love them as my elderly brothers." 
Some effects of his early Bible study show 
themselves here and there in a curious or apt 
English phrase, as when he explains why he did 
not present a few bottles of Japanese wine 
(sake) to his landlord, who preferred Scotch 
whiskey. " It was pearl to a pig. Too pity to 
give away such precious thing which we cannot 
get by money ! So I finished all seven bottles 
in one night" with consequences that were 
rather startling. 

The injurious effects of poor living, overwork, 
exposure, and other hard experiences, at one 
time brought the struggling artist to a condition 
in which he could have sympathized feelingly 
with Job. But through it all he retained his 
native cheerfulness and courage, as we infer from 
passages like the following : 

" Blood-poison visited me next as the penalty of the 
bad food I had. Toothache, influenza, and intestine 
troubles were not modest enough to keep away from me. 
However, the ill-health and the bad weathers never 
affected on my tempers at all. The worst thing was, or 
is evermore, the insincereness of business peoples. Oh, 
those intentional insincerities on the matter of only a 
little payment ! I often sank into most disheartened 
condition, when i thought how faithless this world was." 

Note the delicacy with which the writer refrains 
from accusing these " business peoples " of dis- 
honesty or cheating. It is only " insincereness." 
From first to last, money appears to have been 
a thing beneath the serious consideration of 
this high-minded Samurai. His art and his 



ideal of perfection are what he is seriously con- 
cerned with. Again and again he refuses to 
descend to " pot-boilers," and at all times feels 
reluctant to sell any of his work, so inferior 
does he regard it to that which he aspires to 
execute. It is " studies " simply that he feels 
himself to have been engaged in thus far ; the 
worthy product of his art he sees only far in 
the future. A paragraph from his own pen will 
show his way of looking at the question : 

" At this time I was not at all in ' safe condition of 
my livelihood.' Some kind-hearted person offered me 
a position as an artist for lithographer firm. It was 
3 10s. a week. I absolutely refused this, because I 
knew it would stop my study altogether. Many of my 
friends were either angry with me or laughing at me. 
I got a name, ' most foolish boy.' " 

If it has not already been made plain that 
Mr. Markino's book is written from the heart, 
is in fact the very quintessence of that " sincere- 
ness " which he so justly values, let the conclud- 
ing words of his volume remove all doubt in 
the matter. 

" When I finished writing this book I showed it to 
some friends : they looked rather amazed because I have 
written about my friends and everything < too directly,' 
and I have come back to my own conscience to think 
that I might have written too much. But I am not 
clever enough to conceal the fact that I am not hypo- 
crite enough to tell a lie. So this book itself is I myself. 
When Confucius made Shunju, he said, It is this book 
through which the public will know me. It is this book 
through which the public will condemn me.' I must 
say, too, that it is this book through which I may get 
bitter enemy. It is this book through which I may 
get real friends. Anyhow, it is this book through which 
the public will know me thoroughly." 

The pictures in the book, eight in color and 
four in black and white, are of a daintiness and 
delicacy wholly characteristic of Japanese art, 
but also of a faithfulness in drawing and per- 
spective that remove them from any such mis- 
leading classification. As the artist himself says, 
his style is not Japanese ; it is rather European, 
but he himself would be better pleased to have 
us simply commend its excellence, since, as he 
holds, art that is worthy of the name belongs 
to no one country or one continent. He has 
made a special study of London atmospheric 
effects, and is particularly successful, in these 
illustrations, in giving the glimmer of electric 
lights through fog, and in reproducing the 
veritable rain and slippery wetness of London 
streets in nasty weather ; and all with the trans- 
figuring touch of art. Mr. Douglas Sladen 
contributes a short introduction, and the book 
is dedicated to the author's patrons and friends, 
Mr. and Mrs. M. H. Spielmann.

THE INDIAN AND HIS PROBLEM.* 

To those who have followed Mr. Leupp's 
administration of Indian affairs, and who have 
heard him talk as he did at Mohonk in October, 
1908, the assertion made by his assistant and 
successor, Mr. Valentine, before the Mohonk 
Conference in 1909 that Mr. Leupp had con- 
tributed force and virility to the Indian Service 
as no other man had ever done, will meet with 
a ready endorsement. The same assertive, vigor- 
ous, dominating personality is revealed in the 
book which Mr. Leupp has written concerning 
the Indian problem as he has seen it from both 
within and without the Service. His book will 
probably long remain as the most interesting 
and popular work dealing with the Indian and 
the government attitudes and policies in Indian 
affairs. Mr. Leupp is an adept in combining 
abstract theory with concrete illustrations. In 
fact, his story of personal experiences, limited 
in number as those stories have to be, almost 
obviate the necessity of any formal statement of 
theory. To the casual reader, the book must 
prove not only absorbing in human quality and 
dramatic narrative, but equally persuasive and 
convincing. 

The fundamental proposition of the first 
chapter, that to understand the problem we 
must first understand the Indian, both from 
intimate contact and in perspective, is undoubt- 
edly correct. To a student of the problem it 
must always seem strange that assertions need 
be made that the Indian is genial, talkative, 
honest, artistic, and religious. But on these 
points the reader will turn for fuller and 
even more convincing information to Mr. 
McLaughlin's book on "My Friend the In- 
dian." The author has labored in the Indian 
Service for thirty-eight years, as Agent and 
Inspector, chiefly among the Sioux. Know- 
ing the Indians most intimately, and speaking 
their language, he has been a potent factor in 
Indian affairs for more than a third of a century. 
In this book he reveals rather than tells what 
power he has exerted. What he has seen and 
experienced, as well as what he has learned 
from the lips of noted and unnoted Indians, pro- 
vides him with material for a book that is as 
fascinating as a novel. The style may be uneven, 
but it attains in many places to the beauty of 
poetry and the power of eloquence. The lure of 
the frontier, the romance of love, the tragedy

of suicide, of murder, and of war, all find ex- 
pression here. The Indian's side of the Little 
Big Horn battle and the Ouster tragedy; the 
ghost-dancers and the death of Sitting Bull ; 
Captain Jack and his Modocs ; Joseph and the 
Nez Perec's, all these furnish topics of absorb- 
ing interest. But the more important contribu- 
tion lies in the author's estimate of Indian 
character and in his statement concerning the 
proper treatment of the Indian. 

Mr. McLaughlin believes that the Indian and 
his ancestors "have been treated as liars and 
cheats by liars and cheats." He adds, " I have 
been asked how I have succeeded in retaining 
the respect and even regard of the Indians. . . . 
I may say now . . . that I treated the Indian as 
an individual as nearly as possible as though he 
were a white man and capable of coping with 
white men with their own weapons." "When I 
said I would do a thing I did it." " I had con- 
ceived the idea that the Indian had rights." 
" The making of unfair treaties and the violation 
of treaty rights are the two things of which the 
Indian has most right to complain." The author 
has in recent decades been a maker of treaties 
and agreements with Indians. Although the 
reviewer has never met Mr. McLaughlin, he 
believes that they were both under the same 
treaty tent in Wyoming in the year 1904, after 
the Supreme Oourt had decided in the Lone 
Wolf case that what was regarded by the Indians 
as a treaty was not necessary even as an agree- 
ment. Consultation was an act of grace on the 
part of Congress. Perhaps it was not insignifi- 
cant that the tent came down upon our heads, 
and so forced the meeting from the Indian's 
outdoors to the government council hall. If we 
may believe Mr. McLaughlin, he has exercised 
his large powers in the interest of the red man, 
and he avers that " there never was a time in 
the history of his country when the government 
could not have obtained any reasonable con- 
cession from the Indians, if it had treated the 
red men honestly ; and I know of few Indian 
outbreaks . . . which were not preceded by acts 
of oppression practiced by the civilized people 
on the barbarians." His indisposition to use 
the troops, his belief in a literal fulfilment of 
treaty obligations, and his emphasis upon sub- 
stantial legal rights, are all points worth 
pondering. 

Mr. Leupp's second chapter gives us a brief 
review of the policies which resulted from the 
conquest of the continent by the whites, and 
the consequent pushing aside of the Indians. 
The assertion is made that the buffaloes were

exterminated as a means of reducing the Indians 
to submission, and that the reservation system, 
rations, idleness, debauchery, and graft, were 
the natural outcome. Education was at first 
left to the churches, and to mission schools ; but 
sectarian jealousies brought an end to govern- 
ment subsidies, and compelled a great national 
educational policy. The Government schools, 
however, Mr. Leupp avers, in proportion to out- 
lay do not begin to equal the mission schools in 
results, and " in vital energy must always be 
lacking." Here the reader must beware. Mr. 
Leupp's belief is so strong, and his style so 
lucid and compelling, that we are apt to forget 
that there is another side to the question, and 
that the argument presented is based on a funda- 
mental premise as yet unexpressed. In passing 
it should be said that mission schools, as schools, 
are notably inefficient. It should further be 
remembered that we have in our government 
schools many teachers possessed of an immense 
"vital energy" and the truest devotion. More 
important still, what we lack in school efficiency 
is due in large part to the miserably small 
salaries paid the teachers, to the unjust and 
unnecessary subordination of the school to the 
general administrative authorities, and in partic- 
ular to the disastrous military discipline which 
pervades the whole system. 

The great number of topics discussed by 
Mr. Leupp, and the very practical reforms 
initiated by or under his administration, cannot 
be reviewed here. Problems of land, property, 
inheritance, education, liquor, and administra- 
tion, are all taken up with a view to the enlight- 
enment of the public, the justification of self, 
and criticism of the critics. Mr. Leupp, in 
spite of a special disclaimer to the contrary, 
seems to put a majority of his critics in the 
class of the malevolent or the ignorant. As a 
matter of fact, there are people who are neither, 
who yet differ radically from him. The bottom 
question at issue is summed up in Mr. Leupp's 
striking phrase, " Improvement, not transfor- 
mation." He holds that with all his good 
qualities, the red man remains essentially a 
different being from the white, and that there- 
fore we should cultivate his racial aptitudes, 
with a view to his continued existence as a 
separate species until disease and intermarriage 
remove him from the stage. The Indian is 
and must remain fundamentally incapable of 
certain of our moral, social, and intellectual 
standards, and we make him a hypocritical 
" hopeless and pathetic nondescript " when we 
attempt to introduce him on an even basis into 



our national life. The Indian's " unbalanced 
white friends " have led a number of the race 
to professional aspirations, and these have 
survived, save in three or four instances, only 
as they have settled in some philanthropic city 
where they subsist by continuous borrowing, 
by philanthropic subsidies, and by frauds upon 
the landlady. Without attempting to suggest 
the sharp disclaimer which might be entered 
here, it must be recognized that Mr. Leupp 
argues very strongly for a "policy of shrink- 
age" long known by the term "vanishing 
policy" which will make the Indian a citizen 
with the full rights and obligations of all citi- 
zens. Earnestly, however, as he argues for 
such a policy, he himself has been one of the 
most serious barriers in the way of its realiza- 
tion. When by his influence the Burke law 
superseded the Dawes Act, the possibility of 
citizenship for most Indians was postponed fully 
twenty-five years beyond the time when land 
in sever alty should be granted them. True, 
individual Indians may apply for and may be 
granted citizenship upon proof of special capa- 
city, but Mr. Leupp recognizes that it is only a 
rare Indian who will voluntarily dissociate him- 
self from his tribe, and experience in Canada 
has fully demonstrated the fact. The Indian will 
never choose to jump the chasm which separates 
his stage of civilization from ours, yet his only 
hope of salvation lies in taking the leap. An 
Indian can survive in our civilization only by 
living in it and trusting completely to it, just 
as a man learns to swim only when he casts 
himself into the water. Primitive race after 
primitive race has died out in the presence of a 
higher race, under the unpractical theory that 
gradual improvement rather than quick trans- 
formation was possible. In comparative isola- 
tion, gradual improvement is possible ; under 
sharp competition, the less advanced race has a 
choice between transformation and extinction. 
Mr. Leupp's plan is more drastic than Senator 
Dawes's, for it gives both economic and politi- 
cal freedom at one time, and it postpones the 
moment of transition for most Indians a gen- 
eration in the future, when conditions may be 
harder and the Indians still less prepared than 
now. If we may not hold to the Dawes policy, 
let us at least make self-responsibility compul- 
sory upon the youth as they emerge from our 
schools. 

The same philosophy which would early ad- 
mit the Indian fully into our economic, political, 
and intellectual life, would insist strongly upon 
the inculation of ideas of a legal order by an 



230 



THE DIAL 



[Oct. 1, 



administration based upon definitely established 
law. Unfortunately, it would seem that the 
government from the beginning has essayed to 
prevent any clear definition of the legal status 
of the Indian. This is one of the fundamental 
reasons for the great confusion in Indian poli- 
cies, and for our relative failure in the solution 
of the Indian problem. It is not unfair, then, 
to suggest that perhaps what Mr. Leupp regards 
as a great failure in administrative justice at 
the close of his official career in the famous 
Navajo case may prove to be one of the land- 
marks of progress in Indian affairs and in 
American law. The country owes a debt of 
gratitude to the Indian Rights Association for 
carrying the case to the courts; losing in the 
lower courts, it won in the Supreme Court of 
the Territory. Mr. Leupp probably is right in 
thinking that the government should have car- 
ried the case to the national Supreme Court, 
that we might have a final and definite determin- 
ation of Indian rights and Indian law. Congress 
or some private association should formulate 
at an early date an Indian code. It certainly 
ought not to be true that if the most definite 
court decision on this question (the Standing 
Bear case) is sound and of general application, 
no federal officer who has had charge of the 
dependent race has got through his administra- 
tion without violating the law from once to fifty 
times." The facts and the law regarding the 
Navajo case are likely to be matters of dispute 
and discussion for some years to come. If the 
result be more definite law and a more clearly 
legal administration, the country will have 
reason to be thankful. 

In his discussion of missionaries and of phil- 
anthropic societies, Mr. Leupp raises some very 
important questions. It is probable that in his 
citation of unworthy missionaries he misrepre- 
sents himself to the reader. Three or four 
cases, as he would agree, do not determine the 
character of the great body of missionaries, any 
more than government opposition to mission- 
aries in as many cases demonstrates government 
antagonism to religious teachers as a class. Yet 
it is well to remember that even a missionary 
may be indiscreet and unwise. But beyond that 
we should also remember that people of widely 
different standards, as missionaries and Indian 
Agents sometimes are, see things in very differ- 
ent ways, and that the missionary who will fail 
to protest in certain instances will lose the 
greater part of his power. The efficiency of the 
national administration depends in large part, 
not on the suppression, but on the encourage* 



ment, of independent sources of moral author- 
ity. Pitiful is the case of the missionary who 
has succumbed and become a reservation 
sycophant. On the other hand, our churches 
and societies should demand the highest stand- 
ards of intelligence as a part of character for 
the men and women it is sending into the field. 
The thousand and one ignorant, petty, inter- 
ested or malevolent criticisms that come to a 
Commissioner of Indian Affairs are probably 
enough to make him question the intelligence or 
the virtue of the public. Nevertheless, they are 
the price we have to pay for democracy. A 
remedy which would require every person or 
society to report even its suspicions of wrong 
first to Washington, would be worse than the 
(list-as.-. Such a jHilicy has IM-.-M known to havt- 
absolutely no effect, while a suggestion of a dif- 
ferent method has brought immediate results. 
Even for a Commissioner of the highest energy, 
intelligence, and integrity, such a policy would 
become an intolerable burden. If the remedy 
for democracy is more democracy, the remedy 
for publicity and public intervention is more 
publicity and more public intervention. The 
public would be less ignorant if it knew more. 
We have suffered too long from obscuration of 
principles and suppression of facts. These two 
books make a notable contribution to general 
knowledge, and so will make criticism more 
effective because more intelligent. For the 
same reason, they will also make administra- 
tion, both public and private, more efficient.

THE WORLD AXD MR. CHESTERTOX.* 

The title of Mr. Chesterton's new book is 
" What 's Wrong with the World." He would 
have preferred the terser " What is Wrong," 
but he relates that it startled his mild lady 
visitors and ministerial friends too painfully 
when he remarked to them casually, " I have 
been doing * What is Wrong ' all this morn- 
ing." This would not have mattered to some 
modern authors ; but Mr. Chesterton has a deep 
regard for mild-mannered ladies and orthodox 
^t-ntlfinrn of tin- ol-l >rhool. lit- trinprrnl his 

title. He has also slightly tempered his style ; 
it is not quite so Chestertonian as formerly. 
That is to say, it is better suited to the gravity 
and complexity of a great theme. The sprightly 
manner that befits the defence of pet absurdities,

THE DIAL 



231 



the consideration of life's ephemeral aspects, 
the discussion of " tremendous trifles," or even 
of gay heretics like Mr. Bernard Shaw, is not 
adapted to a serious analysis of the fundamental 
ills that beset modern society. 

What is wrong with the world, according to 
Mr. Chesterton, is of course too much Progress : 
too much G. B. S. with his Fabian Calvinism 
and his obnoxious Superman, too much of Mr. 
Kipling's imperialism, too much Mr. Wells 
romancing easily of a capricious future, too 
much heresy, too much talk of expediency and 
efficiency, too much business, too much special- 
ization, too much muddle-headedness, all 
resulting in too little sensible, democratic, 
definite understanding of what sort of world 
most of us really want. " What is wrong is 
that we do not ask what is right," explains 
Mr. Chesterton airily, meaning, possibly, that 
we cannot agree about what is right. At any 
rate, having put "What's Wrong" in his title, 
Mr. Chesterton makes it his chief care to depict 
the world as it would please himself and " the 
man in the street" that omnipresent, inar- 
ticulate creature who is left out of most socio- 
logical theorizings, but who has found so staunch 
and so brilliant an advocate in G. K. C. The 
paradox of the Chestertonian manner explain- 
ing and defending the habits, tastes, beliefs, 
and hopes of the Average Man is of course the 
ultimate basis for the Chestertonian charm. If 
Mr. Chesterton's conclusions were as subtle 
and esoteric as his reasons, he would be a cult 
for the few, like the second manner of Mr. 
Henry James. But everybody enjoys speculat- 
ing on the subtlety and complexity of common 
things, so long as they remain common. 
Fireworks are fascinating, when they do not 
set anything on fire. 

Thus Mr. Chesterton begins by brilliantly 
demonstrating the fallacy of a few idols of pop- 
ular thought. He proves that idealists are the 
only practical men, that the current insistence 
on that maxim of hope, " Look forward and not 
back," is responsible for many current evils and 
misapprehensions, that wealth and not poverty 
is the great social canker, that compromise is 
ever the great foe to getting something done. 
All this in order that he may clear the way for 
his remedy, or rather for his picture of an ideal 
world, which is to be founded on the simple 
facts that every normal man wants a home of 
his own not a model tenement with com- 
munal cooking, but a house ; that every normal 
woman prefers the " wildness of domesticity " 
to the tame routine of manly labor in factory 



and office, or even to the wildness of being a 
suffragette ; that every child might be healthy 
and happy if its education were directed by its 
mother and not by a schoolmaster with require- 
ments alien to the traditions and possibilities of 
the home. In brief, Mr. Chesterton considers 
the institution of the Family more important if 
possible than the institution of the State. If 
the Socialist agrees with him to the extent of 
wishing to preserve the family, he is warned that 
he must stop talking nonsense about women ; 
if the Tory is of the same mind, he must be 
willing to help equalize property. What is to be 
done with the women, otherwise normal, whom 
Socialism, or some other ism, or the goad of 
necessity, has already turned against " the wild- 
ness of domesticity" is not specified. Mr. 
Chesterton is evidently quite convinced that the 
suffragists are an inconsiderable minority, and 
he implies an easy assurance that the same is 
true of voluntary wage-earners among women. 

But it is idle to criticize Mr. Chesterton for 
not having written a practical guide to the 
re-domesticating of woman. The thing to do 
with Mr. Chesterton is, always, to enjoy him, 
to be waked up by him, to grasp at the distinc- 
tions and analyses that fit in with one's own 
consciousness of life, and not to be irritated 
more than is quite pleasant by those which 
seem absurd. If this attitude is impossible, it 
would appear that the best thing to do with 
Mr. Chesterton is to leave him alone. 

For example, Mr. Chesterton does not know 
all about women, but he puts many of his 
theories very cleverly. This, for instance, about 
the supposed subjection of women : 

" Some impatient trader, some superficial missionary, 
walks across an island and sees the squaw digging in 
the fields while the man is playing a flute ; and immedi- 
ately says that the man is a mere lord of creation and 
the woman a mere serf. He does not remember that 
he might see the same thing in half the back gardens 
in Brixton, merely because women are at once more 
conscientious and more impatient, while men are at 
once more quiescent and more greedy for pleasure. It 
may often be in Hawaii simply as it is in Hoxton. That 
is, the woman does not work because the man tells her 
to work and she obeys. On the contrary, the woman 
works because she has told the man to work, and he 
hasn 't obeyed." 

Another good bit is this, about human pleas- 
ure in property : 

"The mass of men have neither time nor aptitude for 
the invention of invisible beauty. For the mass of men 
the idea of artistic creation can only be expressed by 
an idea unpopular in present discussions the idea 
of property. The average man cannot cut clay into 
the shape of a man ; but he can cut earth into the 
shape of a garden; and though he arranges it with red

geraniums and blue potatoes in alternate straight lines, 
he is still an artist; because he has chosen. The average 
man cannot paint the .sunset whose colon he admires; 
but he can paint his own house with what color he 
chooses, and though he paints it pea green with pink 
spots, he is still an artist; because that is his choice. 
Property is merely the art of the democracy. It means 
that every man should have something that he can 
shape in his own image, as he is shaped in the image 
of heaven." 

We should like to go on with passages about 
the economic dependence of woman and the 
dullness of domesticity, both treated as fallacies 
generated by "mere wealth"; with Mr. Ches- 
terton's ideas about the despotism of modern 
business, and the essential difference between 
umbrellas and walking-sticks, as paralleling the 
difference between communal laundries and com- 
munal kitchens. But the quotability of his ideas 
is less a warrant for quoting them than for going 
to the original source, where juxtaposition gives 
a delightful sense of sprightliness and inex- 
haustible energy, and where close-knit logic 
adds cogency and point.

REMINISCENCES or AN ENGLISH TEACHER.* 

Oscar Browning has for many years been a 
familiar figure in English education. He has 
written much, but his most important work has 
been done as a teacher. His fidelity to this 
task has had the natural result that his repu- 
tation is mainly English, and that in America, 
except to those who know King's College, Cam- 
bridge, and the older Eton, he is hardly more 
than a name on the title-page of several interest- 
ing books. As these books belong to two or 
three different fields, one does not always re- 
member that the Oscar Browning of " Edu- 
cational Theories " is also the author of the 
"Flight to Varennes" or of "Napoleon, the 
First Phase." 

For this reason, some readers of these 
"Memories of Sixty Years" may at first be 
surprised by the author's attitude, by the 
apparent absence of a sense of proportion, infer- 
red from the way in which the "I" and the 
" my " recur on the same levels of importance 
with the names of cabinet ministers and literary 
notabilities. Mr. Browning seems to regard 
with affectionate interest everything that belongs 
to the story of his experience. The little and

indexes trivial incidents of travel, like a tri- 
cycle accident, or an uncomfortable journey in 
a diligence, with the result that the entries 
under his name fill five columns and a half of 
the index. His "Memories" are a sort of 
monologue, and into it the zest of the original 
action brings many matters which to the out- 
sider are seemingly unimportant. Old pupils, 
companions of travel, and friends, are not 
viewed objectively in his pages, even if one of 
them has since become a prime minister and 
another viceroy of India, but intimately, as one 
of his own group. Mr. Balfour is still Arthur 
to him. This attitude, interpreted aright, adds 
interest to Mr. Browning's reminiscences; for 
through his manner of giving them we come to 
know "O. B.," although we may have never seen 
King's College. It is evident that he has always 
been a person of abounding energy, which car- 
ried him whole-heartedly into everything he un- 
dertook, and impelled him to give time and 
devotion without stint to his students or friends. 
Oscar Browning was born in 1837, and was 
educated at Eton and at the King's College. His 
description of the older Eton is vivid. The 
material comforts for the young aristocrats were 
certainly not excessive. For food, the " juniors 
had to content themselves with 4 cabobed breast,' 
a dish I never saw on any other table. It was 
composed of bones, a thin layer of flesh and a 
thick layer of 'cabob,' which looked to the 
uninitiated like boiled chickweed. . . . There 
were not enough plates to go round, and knives, 
forks, and glasses had to be struggled for. One 
left the table as hungry as one had approached 
it." Mr. Browning believes that if he had 
been fed properly at Eton he would have been 
several inches taller. The arrangements for 
washing were so primitive that it was no wonder 
if " little washing was done and less drying, if 
their hands were begrimed with dirt and seamed 
with bleeding cracks. How often was I kicked 
at my tutor's for being a 'dirty tug'!" He 
went back to this unreformed Eton as master 
in 1860, and remained until 1875, when a dif- 
ference with the head master led to his dismissal. 
While at Eton he also had charge of one of the 
houses where the boys lived. His income from 
the two sources would cause the ordinary Ameri- 
can teacher so much astonishment as to leave 
no room for envy. Mr. Browning estimated 
it at 3,000 a year. In 1875 he returned to 
King's College, where he became one of the 
organizers of the " History School," and presi- 
dent of the Cambridge University Day Training 
f..r trachrrs. \sliich he had hcl]-d to

found. The latter position he held until last 
year. 

His " Memories " include accounts of his 
experiences as student and teacher, some exposi- 
tion of his theories of education, and the record 
of innumerable journeys on the continent, 
for as long as he was at Eton at almost every 
vacation he hastened across the Channel, return- 
ing only in time for the first exercise of the 
new term. His work as a teacher and manager 
of a house was exhausting, and he needed the 
diversion of travel in order to maintain the 
pace he had originally set. By his family rela- 
tionships, by his life at Eton and Cambridge, 
and in his travels, he was brought into contact 
with many persons, some of them famous ; and 
of these he notes his impressions. Many of 
these recollections are no more than statements 
of passing contact as, for example, that he saw 
the Emperor Napoleon III. on the street several 
times. Others contain impressions which will 
add something to our knowledge of George 
Eliot, Tennyson, Robert Browning, and certain 
lesser personalities. He looked upon George 
Eliot as an oracle, whose pronouncements he 
obeyed always, except once when she told him 
not to come again until he had gotten himself 
married. Even in this case he offered to obey, 
if she would indicate the person. Her influence 
over him was so great that he was drifting into 
positivism, when an acquaintance with the 
Tennysons, which ripened into intimacy, and 
the influence of Mrs. Tennyson, whom he re- 
garded as a woman ideally beautiful, turned his 
" thought in a spiritual direction." Apropos 
of Tennyson's "Lucretius," which he notes 
" was written to show how an indelicate subject 
might be treated delicately," he says that while 
Tennyson was reading it to him, the poet ex- 
claimed : " What a mess little Swinburne would 
have made of this!" Although he does not 
think Tennyson exaggerated Arthur Hallam's 
abilities and promise, he reports a remark of 
General Fox to the effect that Hallam "was 
the most conceited and priggish young man he 
had ever met." 

What Mr. Browning says about education pos- 
sesses an interest for those who are baffled by the 
confusion of much talking on this problem and by 
the inadequacy of the solutions that are offered. 
He thinks the older Eton gave an excellent edu- 
cation, in spite of its shortcomings, because it 
was founded on the study of literature, and 
because it combined a " firm and uniform course ' ' 
with an element which was " adaptable, fitted 
for every kind of mind and capacity." This 



adaptable element was the " private business " 
which was done in the " pupil room of the tutor, 
and consisted mainly of reading Greek and 
Latin authors apart from the regular course." 
He describes the scene in William Johnson's 
pupil-room : 

"Some dozen fourth-form boys are seated at the 
desks doing their weekly copy of Latin verses. He has 
allowed each to choose a different subject, which, with 
their cooperation, he elaborates as they proceed. . . . 
He calls out to each in turn, stimulating their invention 
and their humours. Each copy of verse when com- 
pleted is a gem, full of fancy and wit and supreme in 
scholarship. While he is driving a not always very 
orderly team ... he is seated at his desk correcting 
with perfect ease copies of sixth-form Greek Iambics, 
translated from Shakespeare, and whistling in a tone 
very sweet and low an air from ' Lucia,' or something 
like his own Eton boating-song." 

When a master Mr. Browning endeavored to 
treat each pupil individually, on the theory that 
every boy's mind has its own order of develop- 
ment, and shows a real desire for knowledge, if 
only the appropriate knowledge be offered at the 
right time. This sounds like an echo from 
Rousseau, but is none the less worth remarking. 
It was in the pupil-room, or in the houses where 
the boys lived, that their growth could be studied 
carefully and the method of treatment be adapted 
to their requirements. The secret of Mr. Brown- 
ing's success was his devotion to his pupils. 
With him, teaching was not a means of income, 
or an opportunity to pursue favorite studies, or 
to write. His great ambition was to train states- 
men. He believes that the study of literature 
furnishes the true basis for the development of 
public spirit, because of the suggestiveness of 
writings like those of Cicero, Livy, and Tacitus. 
Although he had a share in introducing the 
study of science into Eton, he regards its edu- 
cational value as now over-emphasized. The 
chief difficulty of the present situation comes, 
however, from the exaggerated interest in ath- 
letics, which, he believes, amounts to a national 
peril. When he was at Eton, he resisted the 
encroachments of athletics, and his efforts 
divided the school into two parties, the " High 
Souls " and the " Bludgers."

MEANINGS OF Music.* 

Music, being the latest of the arts to arrive 
at maturity, has not given as long a time to 
the theorist for the discovery of its substance 
and the explanation of its achievements as the 
others have done. Moreover, the theorist in the 
new field has had some special difficulties to 
overcome. A painting evidently reproduces a 
scene or a person ; a cathedral is designed to 
afford a place for a ritual and a worship ; a 
statue presents a figure that delivers a ready 
message ; a poem often tells a definite story ; 
the symphonies of the masters, what are they? 
and how do they relate themselves to the essen- 
tial life of mankind? 

Professor Combarieu, in his " Music, its Laws 
and Evolution," has an answer ready, which he 
presents in pages of entertaining and often 
eloquent argument. The matter is carried 
through with the clearness and simplicity char- 
acteristic of the French mind ; but there are not 
wanting indications that some exceptional diffi- 
culties in the subject have been treated with a 
deft lightness t hat is far from being entirely 
convincing. Among his definitive statements 
we find the following : 

Music is the only popular art. It draws its sub- 
stance from social life, as a plant draws its substance 
from the soil into which its roots plunge. There is no 
popular painting, no popular sculpture. Architecture is 
too complicated an art, too loaded with technical knowl- 
edge and archeology, and too much subjected to the 
prejudices of luxury or to special needs, to be the spon- 
taneous product of a community. To music alone, and 
to its younger sister, poetry, belongs this privilege. 

' Such are the principles we shall elucidate when re- 
viewing different peoples and ages. Taking as our basis 
the first proposition, that music u the art of thinking in 
founds, we shall reserve to ourselves the right of adding 
this, which is founded on observation: Musical thought is 
the manifestation of a general and deep instinct, more or 
less hidden, but everywhere recognizable in humanity." 

After the definitions, we have this summary: 

Music a synthesis of sounds not to be confused 
with purely sonorous phenomena has a meaning un- 
translatable into verbal language ; it is formed by a 
thought without concepts, rhythmically constructed, of 
which we cannot anywhere find the equivalent." 

The claims here set up for music are those 
that are now generally upheld by students as well 
as enthusiasts. The author's aim is to give these 
claims a more complete and scientific expression. 
The day is evidently gone by when music can 
be considered merely as a succession of agreeable 
'ounds, whose sole object is to while away a

period of time that perhaps might be otherwise 
given over to more questionable pleasures. Bach, 
Beethoven, and Wagner, have made such con- 
clusions impossible. The message of music is 
essentially that of the other arts ; and probably 
none of them has preswnt^l it with inoiv iulm >s 
or greater allurement. 

The theory above cited is a starting-point for 
the explanation of music in all its forms and 
manifestations. Melody, harmony, the develop- 
ment of instruments, the relation to language, 
the universality of the musical appeal, the pro- 
gress of the art from its incoherent appearances 
in savagery to its maturest creations in modern 
times, are all shown to lie in a comprehension 
of it as thinking in sounds without the inter- 
vention of concepts. As such, it spans the 
whole of thought and is competent to bring to 
light the whole of experience. It is susceptible, 
in our opinion, notwithstanding the stateim-nt 
of our author, of translation into picture or 
poetry ; but it has, of course, elements of ex- 
pression peculiar to itself which constitute its 
special charm. Wagner's idea of the Opera as 
the unification of the arts, in which they mutu- 
ally reinforce the total effect, is thus shown in 
consonance with inherent possibilities of the 
case. 

Professor Combarieu develops the relation of 
music to the various sciences, and to the social 
organization, at full length. The mathematical 
side of music, its physiological aspects, its re- 
markable prevalence and power among primitive 
tribes, its many and remarkable analogies with 
the institutional life of man all these are dis- 
cussed with the learning and system that pertain 
to a comprehensive treatment of the subject. 
One may possibly have doubts about a form of 
thinking that goes on without the intervention of 
concepts ; the truth about music leads, it would 
seem, to a satisfactory exposition of the emo- 
tional nature of mankind, and the adequate ex- 
pression therefor, and should answer completely 
certain questions that for a long time have ob- 
truded themselves. Nevertheless, the subject 
is here treated with a clearness, a fulness, a re- 
cognition of its importance, that deserve praise. 
Music has now reached the point where it can 
turn back upon itself, and study its own mean- 
ings and processes. That music has essentially 
the same substance and message as the other 
arts can hardly call for discussion ; that it treats 
profoundly and with inspiration the meaning of 
this intelligible world in its large aspects, no 
longer requires debate. Professor Combarieu 
gives us a- sympathetic exposition from this point

of view, and does it with singular directness and 
finish. The work is not merely a technical 
treatise, it is also an appeal to the general 
reader, and should have immediate interest for 
everybody who cares about the great art of 
which it treats. The translation, although 
anonymous, is in the main well done.

A HISTORY OF LABOR ix AMERICA.* 

Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Professor 
Kichard T. Ely published his history of " The 
Labor Movement in America," a pioneer work 
in its field, and one which has enjoyed great 
popularity, but which was intended by its author 
only as an earnest of a greater work to come, 
one which should constitute when finished noth- 
ing less than a complete History of Labor in 
the New World. The task of preparing this 
larger work proved, however, too great an 
undertaking for a single investigator; and the 
scantiness of the material which was so arranged 
as to be available for the compiler was brought 
so forcibly to Dr. Ely's attention that he deter- 
mined to organize a force of collaborators and 
endeavor to secure a fund for the prosecution 
of this task of industrial research. He was 
fortunate enough to succeed in both these pre- 
liminary undertakings. 

A portion said by the editors to be the 
most valuable part of the fruits of the inves- 
tigation conducted by the collaborators is now 
being shared with the public in the form of ten 
large volumes entitled " A Documentary His- 
tory of American Industrial Society." While 
it is nowhere directly so stated, it is probable 
that the editors have not abandoned their orig- 
inal intention of producing a narrative history 
of the labor movement, but that they are offer- 
ing those interested an opportunity to judge 
of the thoroughness with which they are pro- 
ceeding by furnishing them, in advance of the 
final work, with a partial survey of the mate- 
rials with which they have to deal. That such 

* A DOCUMENTARY HISTORY OF AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL 
SOCIETY. Edited by John R. Commons, Ulrich B. Phillips, 
Eugene A. Gilmore, Helen L. Sumner, and John B. Andrews.

Industrial Research, with the cooperation of the Carnegie 
Institution of Washington. With Preface by Richard T. 
Ely, and Introduction by John B. Clark. (To be completed 
in ten volumes) . Volumes I. and II-, Plantation and Fron- 
tier, 1649-1863. Edited by Ulrich B. Phillips. Volumes III.,

publication will prove invaluable to other inves- 
tigators in the same field, and that it deserves 
the gratitude of all scholars, will hardly require 
demonstration. 

The title of the work is somewhat mislead- 
ing ; for while the material contained in these 
volumes throws much light on other subjects 
than those pertaining to labor, the undisguised 
purpose of the editors has been to present docu- 
ments which in one way or another deal with 
the labor problem. Some exception to this rule 
may perhaps be allowed in the case of the first 
two volumes, entitled " Plantation and Frontier," 
although here too the main purpose has been to 
throw light on such subjects as the use of coerced 
labor, whether that of the negro slaves or that 
of the indentured whites, and to deal with certain 
aspects of free labor when used either on the 
plantation or at the frontier. Of the other vol- 
umes, two deal with " Labor Conspiracy Cases," 
while the remaining six will reveal the efforts 
that have been made by free laborers to better 
their conditions by means of association, organi- 
zation, and political propaganda. 

To the first volume, Professor Ely contributes 
a "General Preface " to the entire work, setting 
forth the history of its inception and the diffi- 
culties that have been met with in collecting and 
collating the material. He also describes in a 
general way the character of the material which 
has been gathered by the " Bureau of Industrial 
Research," which is the name of the organi- 
zation established to further the work of prepar- 
ing this history of labor. Much of the material 
gathered by the Bureau is not included in the 
contents of the work now being published. 

Dr. Ely's Preface is followed by a " General 
Introduction," written by Professor John B. 
Clark, who figures as one of the "advisory 
editors " of the work. Professor Clark mentions 
what he considers to be the significant economic 
characteristics of American history, and attempts 
not very successfully, it must be said to 
formulate a philosophy of American history 
based on the inter-relation of these leading 
characteristics. The foremost of American eco- 
nomic theorists is clearly not at home in the 
domain of history, and we hardly need the 
testimony of the last page of this Introduction 
(which is numbered 53-65) to convince us that 
this " General Introduction " was intended by 
the editors as a "filler," a service which it 
rather inadequately performs. 

The real Introduction to the first two volumes 
is furnished by their editor, Dr. Ulrich B. 
Phillips of Tulane University, one of the most

[Oct. 1, 



scholarly investigators in the field of Southern 
history. As already stated, the subject matter 
of these two volumes is the " Plantation and 
Frontier"; and Dr. Phillips's Introduction per- 
forms a real service in showing us the part played 
by these historic institutions in our social and 
economic development. He claims that the 
South offers the best examples not only of 
plantation life but of that of the frontier as 
well. The frontier in the Northwest was pro- 
tected by the United States army, and the 
government of this region was under Federal 
authority. In the South, on the other hand, 
little was done to assist the frontiersmen to 
develop their resources, and the people were 
consequently left free to develop their own forms 
of legislation, administration, and military con- 
trol. Dr. Phillips further shows how both the 
plantation and the farming systems spread in 
the South, the conflict between the two systems, 
the development of their respective fields of 
enterprise, and the peculiar fitness of each type 
for the task to be performed. Taking in its 
turn each of the great industrial areas of the 
South, Dr. Phillips traces the growth of popula- 
tion, the history of the selection of staple crops 
suited to the area in question, and the gradual 
adaptation of the form of landholdings and of 
agricultural methods to meet the conditions 
imposed by these crops. 

It would be impossible to mention, let alone 
discuss, most of the nearly 400 documents 
which Dr. Phillips has elected to give us, either 
in full or in part, as his selections for illustrat- 
ing the history of the South between the years 
1649 and 1863. In making his selection, the 
editor tells us that he has sought to combine in 
each instance the three qualities of rareness, 
unconsciousness, and faithful illustration. To 
say that he has succeeded in doing this in every 
instance would be to claim for him the impos- 
sible; and doubtless any investigator in this 
field will be able to criticize with justice some 
of the selections made, and to point to others 
which in his judgment would have better illus- 
trated the tendencies or institutions which it is 
sought to depict. Yet it may be said with fair- 
ness that in no other single work has so much 
material been collected tending to reveal to us 
the real character of the Southern people and 
the problems which they had to solve in the days 
of slavery and the plantation regime y as is to 
be found within the covers of these two volumes. 
An economic history of the South could not be 
written from the material contained in these 
volumes alone, but at the same time many mis- 



takes made by historians who have sought to 
interpret for us the story of the Old South would 
have been prevented could the writers have had 
access to the material now placed before us as 
a result of Dr. Phillips's careful research. For 
the printed materials, political speeches, news- 
paper and magazine articles and editorials, pub- 
lished sermons, even the governmental reports 
and statistics with which historians have in the 
main had to satisfy themselves, were prepared 
by men who were conscious of the fact that 
their work was to receive publication ; and even 
though these men were honest in their convic- 
tions, and earnestly desirous of setting forth 
the truth concerning the subjects with which 
they had to deal, they were hampered by the 
fact that they had a thesis to defend, and they 
knew that what they had to say was likely to 
be used by others as evidence for certain pro- 
positions which they desired should be believed. 
On the other hand, of the documents which Dr. 
Phillips here offers, many not all consist 
of extracts from letters written to members of 
the family or to personal friends, never intended 
for publication : directions from plantation own- 
ers to their overseers and reports from overseers 
to the owners, extracts from diaries and personal 
memoranda kept for the exclusive use of the 
writers, newspaper advertisements, and the like, 
all of which unconsciously describe the real situ- 
ation in the ante-bellum South and enable us 
to understand somewhat of the life of a by-gone 
age which few of us, in the North at least, have 
ever been able to comprehend. 

The documents in the first volume have to 
do entirely with the Plantation, describing its 
management, routine, staple crops, vicissitudes, 
supplies and factorage, overseers, and white 
labor, whether free or indentured. Particularly 
interesting are those which deal with the experi- 
ence of planters and overseers with slave labor 
and that of the bond- servants. It is from these 
documents that one gets the most accurate infor- 
mation concerning the real advantages and dis- 
advantages of coerced labor ; and no abolitionist 
could have better pictured the economic evils 
resulting from trying to carry on agricultural 
operations with slave labor and absentee owner- 
ship than do many of these letters and planta- 
tion reports. The reader is quite prepared to 
sympathize with the brother-in-law of Ho well 
Cobb, who wishes that he could trade his negroes 
for lands. The lands would lie still, and not 
bother one like the negroes." 

The section dealing with " Plantation Vicissi- 
tudes " shows us the fear which constantly pos-

sessed the slaveowner that his most valuable 
property might at any time be lost, by running 
away, by theft, by disease, or by suicide. The 
cholera in particular was a subject of dread. 

Other documents of much interest in the first 
volume are those in which redemptioners in 
colonial days give the results of their experience 
in selling themselves into service. Two of these 
which deserve especial mention are the accounts 
furnished by an intelligent schoolmaster and by 
a confessed criminal. 

The selections contained in the second volume 
cover a wider range than do those in the first. 
About half of the volume contains documents 
having to do, in one way or another, with slavery 
and slave labor. Other subjects treated are the 
free negroes, whose presence in the South was 
always a thorn in the flesh to the slave-owner, 
the poor whites, immigration and western migra- 
tion, frontier settlement and frontier society, 
manufacturing and town labor, and public reg- 
ulation of industry and commerce. 

Both the bright and the dark sides of slavery 
are well presented by these documents, and the 
editor, although a Southerner, has held no brief 
for either side. Some of the documents contain 
an element of real pathos, as, for example, 
the letter of Billy Proctor to John Lamar, urg- 
ing the latter to purchase him until he can buy 
his own freedom. On the other hand, the easy, 
care-free life of the Jamaica slave is indicated 
by this statement of an English planter : " As 
far as I can judge, if I were now standing on 
the banks of Vergil's Lethe, with a goblet of 
waters of oblivion in my hand, and asked 
whether I choose to enter life anew as an English 
labourer or a Jamaica negro, I should have no 
hesitation in preferring the latter." Probably 
the most interesting document in either volume 
is the one which purports to be a description 
by an intelligent slave of his experiences as a 
member of a slave-gang being taken from 
Maryland to South Carolina. The description 
of the journey may be a tolerably correct pic- 
ture of what was likely to occur, but the inter- 
nal evidence is against the authenticity of the 
document itself. 

The documents that describe frontier condi- 
tions are not numerous, but are selected with a 
view to illustrating conditions in various parts 
of the South as the frontier was gradually 
pushed westward and northward. There is an 
interesting description of a Georgia camp-meet- 
ing held in the year 1807, in which "thirty-seven 
Methodist preachers " participated. Preaching 
occured four times a day, with usually an ex- 



hortation following the sermon, and all-night 
sessions were not infrequent. The meetings 
lasted five days, and the average attendance was 
from three to four thousand. If a statistical 
estimate of the results of the meetings be not out 
of place, it may be safe to venture the remark 
that only "eighty souls converted, including 
black and white people " seem to be rather 
scanty returns from such strenuous efforts. 

In volumes three and four, and in the sup- 
plementary volume, Professors Commons and 
Gilmore have reprinted the court proceedings 
in seven important cases, occuring between the 
years 1806 and 1842, in which combinations of 
laborers were indicted and tried for conspiring 
to raise their wages. Several other cases of the 
same sort are given briefer notice by the editors. 
All of these cases have to do with what is to-day 
known as the " closed shop " controversy. 

The earliest and perhaps the most important 
of these cases is that of the Philadelphia cord- 
wainers of 1806. Eight journeymen boot and 
shoe makers of that city were tried and found 
guilty of entering into a conspiracy to raise their 
wages, and each of the defendants was fined 
eight dollars and costs. The chief point at issue 
in this and the subsequent trials was as to 
whether the English common law, according to 
which combinations of laborers to raise wages 
were illegal, was applicable to the United States. 
Notwithstanding a strong showing by the de- 
fense, who argued that there was no precedent 
for such a trial in the history of our colonies, 
and that the spirit of American constitutions 
and laws was opposed to this idea of conspiracy, 
the Recorder in his charge to the jury practi- 
cally left that body no alternative but to render 
a verdict of guilty. 

The original pamphlet report of this case is 
very rare, being found in few libraries. How 
scarce it had become is shown by the fact that 
only twenty-two years later in Philadelphia 
itself, when the record was wanted in a similar 
trial of the journeymen tailors, the counsel for 
the prosecution said that he had been unable to 
find any record of the proceedings in the earlier 
trial. It is a somewhat curious fact that the 
copy from which the editors have secured their 
reprint was found in the library of the State 
University of Iowa. 

The later cases reported in these volumes are 
very much similar to the one just described, 
with the difference that as time passes both 
court and jury become somewhat more lenient 
concerning the offence of the laboring men, un- 
til in one or two of the later cases, particularly

in that of the Thompson ville (Conn.) weavers, 
the verdict turned in favor of the workers. How 
far the legal question at issue is from being a 
dead one even today, however, is shown by the 
recent decision of Judge Richardson of the 
Massachusetts Superior Court, that a strike 
called for the purpose of compelling an em- 
ployer to unionize his shop is illegal. 

In a splendid introduction to these three vol- 
umes Professor Commons has utilized the facts 
brought out in these cases and elsewhere to trace 
the development of industrial organization in the 
boot and shoe industry. M. B. HAMMOND.

and achievements of our foremost humorist " My 
Mark Twain " (Harper) is made up of the recent 
chapters of personal reminiscence published in 
" Harper's Magazine," sundry " Atlantic " reviews 
of early books by Mark Twain, and a few later appre- 
ciations of the man and his work from other period- 
icals. The poem, "The American Joke," read by 
Mr. Howells at the birthday dinner given to his 
friend in 1905, agreeably closes the book. That the 
author of " Tom Sawyer " was a boy to the end of 
his days, and that as a humorist he is to be ranked 
with Cervantes and with Swift, neither of whom, 
however, was his equal in humanity ; and, further, 
that as an orator or lecturer he was " the most 
consummate public performer " Mr. Howells has 
ever seen, being, on the platform, "the great and 
finished actor which he probably would not have 
been on the stage " these are some of the terms 
in which are expressed a warm appreciation and 
hearty admiration of him concerning whose death 
Johnson's famous words on the death of Garrick 
might have been uttered with far less of hyperbole 
than in their original application. Even above his 
scrupulous honesty in discharging that mountain of 
debt which was none of his contracting, Mr. Howells 
rates his friend's " abhorrence of the Spanish War, 
and the destruction of the South-African republics, 
and our deceit of the Filipinos, and his hate of slav- 
ery, . . . and his support of a poor artist for three 
years in Paris, and his loan of opportunity to the 
youth who became the most brilliant of our actor- 
dramatists," and "even his pity for the wounded 
bird throbbing out its little life on the grass for the 
pleasure of the cruel fool who shot it." The book 
is an instructive and engrossing study of a noble 
and unique character, and no one can read it with- 
out being the better for it Its fine portraits and 
views add much to its attractiveness. 



Shall one be a sober chronicler of 

^ or * Merr y Andrew of liter* 
ture ? Or can one unite the two func- 
tions as a critic ? These thoughts come naturally to 
the mind in reading Mr. James Huneker's latest 
book of essays, " Promenades of an Impressionist" 
(Scribner), a study of painters, etchers, sculptors of 
to-day, yesterday, or forever, Rodin, Rops, Botti- 
celli. Mr. Huneker, in the matter of style, scintil- 
lates, challenges, and alternately provokes and de- 
lights. He forgets that while cleverness arouses, 
only beauty of manner satisfies in the long run. Like 
Mr. Chesterton, he falls over his own smartness again 
and again ; and, if you happen to know something 
whereof he speaks, you have an uneasy sense that he 
seizes on the eccentrics and extremists of art or liter- 
ature or music and uses them for what they offer him 
as picturesque material. You fear that he will sacri- 
fice a fact to an epigram, or at least that effect with 
him always comes first Yet hardly have you said 
this, when your eye encounters some plangent phrase 
or some search-light of penetrative opinion, and you 
feel apologetic. One thing is sure, anyway, with 
regard to Mr. Hnneker : he is neither negative nor 
neuter. If it be the business of the impressionist not 
only to receive impressions, but to impress, he cer- 
tainly does his duty. He offers a kind of sauce 
piquante to the literary feast The way to read liim 
is to get your humdrum facts from Dr. Dryasdust 
then turn to this cocksure art-for-art's-sakist, and 
respond to his stimulation and suggestiveness. He 
has sympathy, that precious quality, and love for 
those he writes of ; read him on Degas, or Monticelli, 
for example, what a tender-ironic lovely note is that 
with which he closes his brief study of the last- 
named colorist : " Alas, poor Fada ! " Stimulation, 
suggestion, sympathy, egoistic bias, and a harlequin's 
pleasure in the fine phrase, these are all here and 
make the volume at once a delight an irritation, and 
a danger. 

In "The Psychology of Reasoning" 
(Appleton) Professor W. B. Pills- 
bury has made available a useful 
guide to a useful subject. The title of his volume 
suggests either of two references ; and it is import- 
ant to state that its content refers to the psycho- 
logical analysis of the logical procedures, and not to 
the general consideration of the wealth of psycho- 
logical processes that go on in the human mind when 
it is on reasoning bent The appeal of the volume 
is to the student It sets before him as psychology 
what has been most commonly considered as logic. 
Reasoning as an instrument, both in its operation 
and in the securing of the wherewithal to work upon, 
is dependent upon a fair range of mental procedure. 
Experience would be reacted too formlessly and un- 
protitably were it not that through the mind's logical 
temper it coalesces in a system, a system of mean- 
ings. The justification of reasoning belongs to logic ; 
the description of the contributory tendencies belongs 
to psychology. Naturally the latter follows the well- 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



239 



marked path of the former ; and the several chap- 
ters of the present volume undertake to set forth 
what is involved on the psychological side when the 
mind believes and judges, when it infers and syllo- 
gizes, when it proves and generalises and applies. 
The discussion drifts at times into finer distinctions 
that seem urgent ; but at bottom the only difference 
between the plain man's account of these processes 
and the academic one is a more disciplined realisa- 
tion of the implications. The plain man, like the 
logician, uses a system to make of his mental rumina- 
tion a real progressive digestion. He feels less keenly 
the satisfaction that comes from an inward analysis 
and justification ; but, the student interest once as- 
sumed, the expositions furnished by Professor Pills- 
bury may be warmly commended as a safe and sane 
guide to the understanding of a technical but import- 
ant chapter in the mind's productions and processes. 

In Mr. H. J. Moors's agreeably anec- 
dotal volume, "With Stevenson in 
Samoa" (Small, Maynard & Co.), 
are a number of corrections of false impressions. 
At least, the author evidently believes in the correct- 
ness of his corrections, and he certainly had full 
opportunity to become acquainted with the real 
Stevenson, being his first host and his constant 
intimate in Samoa, besides acting as his agent and 
banker in business and pecuniary matters. u It has 
been said," writes Mr. Moors, " that he took his ill 
health cheerfully ; that is wrong, it was his good 
health that he took cheerfully." As to the novelist's 
flageolet-playing, we read : "My friend Carruthers, 
who had him for a neighbor, averred positively that 
he played so dolefully upon the instrument as to be 
a menace to one's enjoyment of life." According to 
the author's account and he seems to have been 
in a position to know, being purchasing agent for 
the family enough cigarettes and coffee were con- 
sumed at Vailima to shorten the lives of several 
strong men, to say nothing of one invalid. But the 
Stevensons were lavish entertainers, and spent a 
small fortune in enlarging and keeping up their 
island villa. That they cleared, however, the whole 
of the four hundred acres attached to it, as at least 
one biographer has asserted, is declared by Mr. 
Moors to be false, since only fifteen acres were thus 
reclaimed from the wilderness. The author's strong 
disapproval of Stevenson's collaborating with another 
in story-writing was openly expressed to him at the 
time of this perversion of his genius, and will be 
heartily endorsed by all true lovers of K. L. S. Mr. 
Moors's book is fully illustrated and forms a welcome 
addition to the already long list of reminiscences of 
a most winsome personality. 

The rather unaccountable lack of 
of*" vttthll." any Previous biography of William 

Beckford, excepting the unsatisfac- 
tory compilation given to the world in 1859 by 
Cyrus Redding, makes unusually welcome " The 
Life and Letters of William Beckford of Fonthill " 



(Duffield) from the competent pen of Mr. Lewis 
Melville. By permission of the Duke of Hamilton, 
in whose possession, by reason of the marriage of 
Beckford's daughter Susan to the tenth Duke, are 
many letters and other papers of Beckford's, much 
manuscript material of value has been at the biog- 
rapher's disposal ; and the book abounds in extracts 
from these and other equally important original 
documents. The many letters, printed entire or in 
part, tell much of Beckford's life-story in his own 
words. They are the letters of a man never un 
mindful of his own dignity, somewhat pompous in 
style, but revealing great vigor of intellect, a wide 
range of interests and tastes, varied and extensive 
learning, and remarkable strength of character and 
force of will. " He was inclined, especially in his 
later days, to take himself seriously," we read, "but 
his sense of honour always saved him from becoming 
ridiculous" a timely rescue that the rest of us 
generally owe to our sense of humor. The most 
interesting chapters in the book are those relating 
the genesis and history of "Vathek" and the build- 
ing of Fonthill Abbey. Numerous characters of 
note appear as Beckford's friends and correspond- 
ents, despite the literally walled-in life he led at 
Fonthill. Mr. Melville's " Bibliography," with its 
long list of successive editions of " Vathek," attests 
the former popularity of that now little-read romance, 
and it also calls attention to the now never-read 
other works from the same pen. A contemporary 
description of Fonthill recalls, in twelve closely 
printed pages, the splendors of that costly piece of 
architecture. The French passages in the book are 
not free from typographical errors, but otherwise 
the workmanship of the volume is admirable. Ten 
portraits and two views of the Abbey are inserted. 
This is a biographical work not likely ever to be 
superseded. 

Fortunately, it is quite impossible to 

of Flor^L. write a duU book about Florence, 
not only does the subject forbid, but 
even a dull person, under the spell of Florence, be- 
comes to a certain extent an inspired one. Hence, 
in taking up a new addition to the already long list 
of books about the city, one is pretty nearly certain 
that while he will find nothing new the chances are 
that he will not be bored. Such proves to be the 
case with Mr. Max Vernon's "In and Out of 
Florence" (Holt). "Florence, Mecca of that sect 
of believers, persistent even in these breathless days 
of machines and money-madness, the believers in 
the reality of the ideal," the author exclaims on 
the first page of his book. But he recognizes also 
that one cannot live on wonder and inspiration 
alone ; even John in the desert had his locusts and 
wild honey. Many are the persons who, like Mr. 
Vernon, wish to become temporarily Florentines. 
Neither hotel nor pension will satisfy ; they must 
take a house or villa, or at least a villino, in order 
to come into closer touch with the community. All 
such will be grateful for the opening chapters, deal-

ing with such practical matters as house-hunting, 
servants, marketing, housekeeping, garden and 
village (Settignano, in this case.) These details 
being happily adjusted, the author becomes a chatty 
but never tedious guide to the usual sights, the 
churches, the galleries, the courts and palaces, stray 
pictures on monastery walls, the streets, the shops, 
the festas, the nearby excursions to Vallombrosa, 
Prato, Pistoja, Lucca, and Pisa. The book does 
not pretend to take the place either of general guide 
like Baedeker, Gardner, or Hare, or yet of the 
specialist like Berenson, Hewlett, Hyett, or Zim- 
mern. Rather it is to be commended as agreeable 
reading for a first-tripper, either before going or 
after his return. Not the least of its charm is its 
copious and artistic illustrations of Italian scenery 
from the drawings of Miss Maud Lanktree, besides 
the good reproductions from photographs of famous 
paintings, sculpture, and architecture. 

WoolrowiH The P"^ 6 of Mr ' C ' W Wright's 
at affected by volume on " Wool-Growing and the 
the tariff. Tariff " (Houghton ) is " to examine 

the history of the wool-growing industry in this 
country with a view to finding out what influences 
have shaped its development and especially to what 
extent it has been affected by the tariff." The task 
has been well done, especially the first part of it ; 
and although the author disavows any intention of 
attempting to state in detail the effect of the tariff 
at different periods, yet the intelligent reader will 
not be in much doubt as to the author's opinion in 
this particular. Mr. Wright very properly realizes 
that economic results are the product of many vari- 
able forces, and he refuses to attempt to assign to 
each force its weight in bringing about the result. 
The study shows familiar acquaintance with the 
original and secondary sources of material. Foot- 
notes and references are numerous, and at the close 
of each chapter a summary is given on excellent 
feature of a study in economic history. The develop- 
ment of the industry is divided into eight periods, 
viz., wool-growing before 1800 ; the advent of the 
Merino, 1800-1815; commercial wool-growing, 
1816-1830; the supremacy of the East, 1830- 
1840 ; the rise of the middle west, 1840-1860 ; the 
Civil War period, 1860-1870; the rise of the far 
west, 1870-1890; free wool and the end of the 
westward movement, 1890-1907. It may be ques- 
tioned whether there is in each case logical reasons 
for such absolute divisions, but the plan adds interest 
and definiteness to the subject. The author considers 
the protective duties to have benefitted the manu- 
facturers more than the growers of wool. The study 
shows the effect of the tutelage of Professor Taussig, 
and no better guarantee of its value could be given. 
A number of interesting charts add much to the 
value of the book. It is the type of a study which 
is all too rare, and its contents should be made gen- 
erally known in this period of wide-spread interest 
in the question of what shall be the characteristics 
of our future tariff legislation. 



Something more than a literary com- 
f-.'ii-iiiinii of tht pilation, quite as much, perhaps, a 
istheenturv. wo mans' rights document, is Miss 
Ethel Rolt Wheeler's book entitled Famous Blue- 
Stockings " (John Lane Co.). The group of brilliant 
women who formed the kernel of cultured London 
society between 1770 and 1785 were by no means 
noisy advocates of woman suffrage, but they proved 
by their own accomplishment that wit and learning 
in women are not inconsistent with domestic Hli- 
ciency and sound common sense, nor even with the 
retention of feminine charm. More than this, they 
even raised their voices in calm and gentle criticism 
of the position assigned their sex, although leaving 
to their great-granddaughters all forcible efforts to 
right such wrongs. The arrangement of Miss 
Wheeler's book is peculiar. Alternating with the 
general chapters on manners and customsare separate 
biographies of the leading " Blue-Stockings," Mrs. 
Montagu, the brilliant and lavish hostess ; Mrs. 
Delany, the marvellous artist in " paper mosaics "; 
Mrs. Thrale, the somewhat melodramatic enthusiast ; 
Mrs. Vesey, the sweet and sympathetic friend of 
humankind ; Mrs. Chapone, the exponent of straight- 
laced propriety ; Fanny Burney, the gifted egoist ; 
Elizabeth Carter, the learned but unassuming 
translator of Epictetus ; Hannah More, the ver- 
satile - writer, the educational and social reformer. 
A proem sketches the striking characteristics of the 
age, and a conclusion treats of its influence on later 
generations. The author makes dexterous use of 
the points of contact between these gifted ladies 
and the more familiar names from the other sex, 
Johnson, Richardson, Garrick, Macaulay, Scott, Sir 
Joshua Reynolds, Goldsmith, John Wesley, and a 
long list of others. The fascinating spirit of the 
eighteenth century is caught most delightfully in 
these lively pages. 

Vocation* for Recent agitations and activities 
the trained among women have caused the dis- 
coiieue woman. Cug8 i on o f their particular problems 
to assume a place not inconspicuous in current litera- 
ture. A recent publication of the Women's Educa- 
tional and Industrial Union of Boston, entitled 
" Vocations for the Trained Woman Opportunities 
other than Teaching," answers, with conciseness, 
many questions necessarily put by the educated 
woman about to earn her living, and is valuable 
since it deals with fact rather than with speculation, 
and is free from sentimentality. The book, we are 
told, is an outcome of the conviction that many 
women who are unfitted for teaching drift into that 
vocation as the one with which they are most famil- 
iar ; that the teaching which results is poor ; and 
that unsuccessful teachers might become able work- 
ers in other fields. In order to suggest what these 
fields are, and to indicate to what extent a college 
education helps a woman to attain positions and 
promotions therein, this series of articles has been 
prepared by specialists, men and women actively 
interested in the subject they are presenting. The

conditions described are largely those now existent 
in Massachusetts and New York, but the conclusions 
deduced therefrom are presumably applicable to a 
more extended area. Seventy articles or thereabouts 
are grouped under the eight headings of Social and 
Economic Service, Scientific Work, Domestic Science 
and Arts, Agriculture, Business, Clerical and Secre- 
tarial Work, Literary Work, Art ( Illustrating and 
Designing), and Special Forms of Teaching. Each 
contributor has endeavored to set forth the qualifi- 
cations and training necessary efficiently to follow 
such vocations as he describes, and to take account 
of the compensations therein and the opportunities 
for advancement. One is impressed with the fact 
that nowadays either specialized education or a long 
apprenticeship is requisite for success in any given 
field. In presenting these facts, no false lure is 
held out to the woman about to earn her living; she 
need, however, find no occasion for discouragement ; 
the search-light has been turned helpfully upon the 
occupations which are open to her. 

The father a ^ e 8 i xteentn of September, 1810, 

of Mexican in the churchyard of the little Mexi- 
mdependence. can village of Dolores, there arose 
from the motley crowd of villagers, armed and un- 
armed, gathered about their priest, Miguel Hidalgo 
y Costilla, a great shout, " Viva Independence! 
Viva America ! Muera el mat gobierno ! " This 
battle cry of freedom, known ever since as "el Grito 
de Dolores" is annually commemorated by fitting 
ceremonies throughout the Republic of Mexico, and 
has this year had its centennial celebration. Almost 
simultaneously with that celebration there has ap- 
peared in this country a biography of the priest and 
patriot, the originator of the movement for Mexican 
independence. " The Life and Times of Miguel 
Hidalgo y Costilla " (McClurg) is the joint work 
of Dr. Arthur Howard Noll and Mr. A. Philip 
McMahon, and is the first complete account of that 
famous man in our language, if not indeed in any 
language. At all events there seems to be no 
adequate biography of him in his own country, and 
the authors have shown diligence and zeal in getting 
together, from sources none too abundant, so many 
facts concerning one whose life in full detail can 
now probably never be told. Their book, of two 
hundred pages, is a noteworthy contribution to the 
history of Mexican independence. A portrait of 
the patriot, " from a rare print," forms the frontis- 
piece. 

Professor J. Arthur Thomson justly 



. 

writers on biological subjects. He 
has the rare ability to present the concrete data of 
science on the one hand, and the theoretical discus- 
sion of such data on the other hand, in a manner 
that is at once technically correct and untechnically 
comprehensible and interesting. His latest book, 
" Darwinism and Human Life" (Holt), consists of a 
series of lectures delivered in 1909 under the auspi- 
ces of the South African Association for the Ad- 



vancement of Science. In the Preface the author 
states : " It was the chief aim of the lectures to ex- 
plain the gist of Darwinism what problems 
Darwin set himself to solve, and what solutions he 
arrived at, and to indicate what progress has been 
made as regards the problems of Organic Evolution 
since Darwin's day what has been added to 
Darwinism, what, if anything, has been taken away, 
and, especially, what is now being reconsidered." 
As was to be expected from the quality of Professor 
Thomson's previous writings, the task thus set has 
been well done. The book is especially to be com- 
mended to college and university teachers who wish 
to put into the hands of students a brief account of 
what has been accomplished in the study of evolu- 
tion, which shall be authoritative and at the same 
time of a sort to stimulate and hold interest. No 
better book for such a purpose is available. The 
last chapter, " Selection : Organic and Social," deals 
in a sane way with the problems and possibilities of 
eugenics. A brief but well chosen list of recent 
books on evolutionary topics closes the volume. It 
is a pity that so good a book, containing such a 
wealth of detailed facts to which many a reader will 
want to refer, should not have been deemed worthy 
of an index. 

The mounted The events fading up to the organi- 
poiice of the zation of the mounted constabulary 
far Northwest. o f northwestern British America, 
the stern task confronting this gallant force, and 
divers incidents and adventures from its history, 
together with the writer's personal experiences as 
the policemen's guest, in the barracks and on the 
prairie, are fully and graphically related by Mr. A. 
L. Haydon in a substantial octavo entitled " The 
Riders of the Plains: Adventures and Romance 
with the North-West Mounted Police, 18731910," 
published by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. The 
author writes that it has been his " good fortune and 
privilege to be admitted into the confidence of the 
corps, and thus to acquire exclusive and accurate 
information." Instances proving the efficiency of 
this carefully selected and well trained police force 
abound in Mr. Haydon's pages, interspersed with 
stories and adventures of a diverting character, and 
also agreeably diversified with numerous illustra- 
tions, chiefly from photographs, and with four maps 
and diagrams. A chapter entitled " Horse Thieves 
and 'Cattle Rustlers'" contains some especially 
striking instances of prompt and successful action on 
the part of the Mounted Police, and one on "Indian 
Problems " is of no less interest. In describing the 
ruthless practices that have cleared the buffalo herds 
from the prairie, the author uses a far too mild 
word (" decimation " ) to denote their rapid deple- 
tion. If our buffalo-hunters had been content with 
decimation the bison (to give the animal its proper 
name) would still abound in the great Northwest. 
The present awakened interest in that land of 
promise makes timely and acceptable such a work 
as Mr. Haydon's.

serially in " McClure's Magazine " before appearing in 
book form. 

Two further volumes of the Emerson Journals are 
shortly to be issued by Houghton Mifflin Co. They will 
contain virtually all the hitherto unprinted matter written 
bj Emerson from 1833 to 1837. 

New editions of two of Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim's 
earlier novels, "The Mystery of Mr. Bernard Brown" 
and "A Daughter of the Marionis," have just been 
issued by Messrs. Little, Brown & Co., the authorized 
publishers in America for all of Mr. Oppenheim's work. 

During the autumn the Macmillan Co. will publish 
the first volume of the Life of Lord BeaconsBeld, based 
on his private papers, that Mr. W. F. Monypenny has 
been engaged upon for some years past. This volume 
covers the period from Disraeli's birth to his entry into 
Parliament in 1837. 

The general interest aroused by the publication of 
M. Romain Holland's romance in ten volumes entitled 
" Jean Christophe " has led Messrs. Henry Holt & Co. to 
prepare a translation of the first two, which they will pub- 
lish in one volume under the title of "John Christopher: 
Dawn and Morning." 

Mr. Harry Peyton Steger, literary executor of the 
late W. S. Porter (" O. Henry "), would be glad to have 
copies of any letters or documents from this writer, or 
to hear from anybody who is interested in a biography 
of O. Henry." Communications should be addressed to 
Mr. Steger at Garden City, New York. 

During the spring of 1911 Messrs. G. P. Putnam's 
Sons are planning to bring out The Letters of Eliza- 
beth Cady Stan ton : An Epistolary Autobiography." 
The work will be edited by Mr. Theodore Stanton and 
Mrs. Stanton Blatch. The editors would be glad to 
receive copies or the originals of any of Mrs. Stanton's 
letters, which could be addressed to Mr. Theodore 
Stanton, Rue Raynouard, Paris. Among the materials 
to be used as explanatory of Mrs. Stanton's letters will 
be extracts from inedited letters of many of the leaders 
of the old Abolition Movement. 

4 Knight's Dramatic Reader for Grammar Grades," 
by Miss Marietta Knight, embodies a novel idea in 
school reading. The selections are all in dialogue form, 
sometimes taken directly from such works as "Julius 
Cesar," " Wilhelm Tell," and "Giles Corey of the 
Salem Farms," and sometimes adapted from such nar- 
rative sources as " Alice in Wonderland," " Tanglewood 
Tales," and " Kenilworth." Every teacher knows that 
children like this sort of reading better than any other, 
and the book ought to be particularly welcome. It is 
sent us by the American Book Co., who also publish 
" Nature Myths of Many Lands," by Miss Florence V. 
Farmer, and " Stephen of Philadelphia," a story of the 
old days in Penn's Colony, by Mr. James Otis. 

The importance of publicity for public institutions, 
and more particularly for public libraries, is briefly 
treated by Mr. John Cotton Dana, librarian of the 
Newark (N. J.) Public Library, in Part IV. of his 
"Modern American Library Economy" (Elui Tree 
Press, Newark). As in the other issues of this series, 
it is the the Newark library's methods and their results 
that are presented. Many modes of attracting public 
attention to its varied educational activities have been 



tried by this progressive institution, and what Mr. 
Dana has to say of their comparative effectiveness is of 
interest and value to other library workers. " Try all 
things ; keep everlastingly at it ; and especial! y keep 
everlastingly at it in the newspapers," are his closing 
words. 

It is announced that the Cambridge University Press 
has taken over the control and copyright of the eleventh 
edition of " The Encyclopedia Britannica," which is to 
appear about the end of the year. The Syndics of the 
Press have thought it wise to explain in a pamphlet the 
circumstances that have led to this novel departure. 'Do- 
main point is this: that the association of the University 
with the publication amounts to a guarantee that it is a 
trustworthy guide to sound learning, being not only 
up-to-date, but also the work of experts who are en- 
titled to speak on their several subjects. The new vol- 
umes represent the elaborate organization and arduous 
labour of eight years, and the editor, while retaining 
certain articles of permanent value, has been constantly 
employed in securing authoritative contributions from 
new hands in many countries. The whole edition will 
be issued as a complete work. A current Index has 
been in use throughout, and special pains have been 
taken to avoid mere verbosity, duplications, and incon- 
sistencies. So, though the Eleventh Edition occupies 
but little more space than the Ninth twenty-eight 
volumes, including one devoted to the Index, as against 
twenty-five it is believed that it will contain twice as 
much independent information. In the practical ques- 
tion of form there will be a great advance. The use of 
India paper will reduce the size and weight of the vol- 
umes to less than one-third of the average of ordinary 
paper, and this edition will be provided with limp bind- 
ings, so that the difficulties experienced in handling the 
old cumbrous volumes will entirely disappear. 

Four interesting anthologies soon to be issued by the 
Oxford University Press are " The Oxford Book of 
Ballads," chosen and edited by Sir Arthur Quiller- 
Couch ; " The Oxford Book of Italian Verse," chosen 
by St. John Lucas ; " The Englishman in Greece," with 
an introduction by Sir J. Reunell Rodd ; and A Book 
of Light Verse," edited by Mr. R. M. Leonard. Frm 
the same source we are promised new and complete 
editions of Coleridge, with much unpublished matter, 
edited by Mr. E. H. Coleridge ; of Dryden, edited by 
Mr. J. Sargeaunt ; of Moore, edited by Mr. A. D. 
Godley ; and of Shakespeare, in the " World's Classics " 
series, with a general introduction by Swinburne, intro- 
ductory studies by Professor Dowden, and a note by 
Mr. Watts-Dunton. In the "Oxford Library of Prose 
and Poetry " the following volumes are announced : 
Clough's Poems, edited by Mr. H. S. Milford ; Shelley's 
Poems of 1820 ; Jeffrey's Literary Criticism, edited by 
Mr. D. Nichol Smith ; and Charles Reade's "A Good

Courier, Buffalo, N. Y. : " The infinite charm of this book U like that

The Finest Edition of Shakespeare 
at Less than Half Price 



STRATFORD TOWN SHAKESPEARE, ranking with the finest of editions de 
luxe, was printed at the Shakespeare Head Press at Stratford, which was especially 
established, under the direction of Mr. A. H. Bullen, to do honor to Shakespeare's 
memory by printing a worthy edition of his works in his native town. It is the only 
complete edition of Shakespeare's Works ever printed and published in his native 
town, and so will have for all time an interest and distinction placing it entirely apart 
from any other existing or future edition of Shakespeare. 



The 
Format 



Editorial 
Features 



Press 
Opinions 



The set comprises ten royal octavo volumes. One thousand numbered sets, on English hand- 
made paper, have been printed, of which two hundred and fifty are for America. Each vol- 
ume contains a photogravure frontispiece, eight being portraits of Shakespeare, one of Richard 
Burbage, the chief actor of Shakespeare's time, and one of the Earl of Southampton, Shake- 
speare's patron, to whom his Sonnets are supposed to have been dedicated. The type is the 
original Old Face type cut by William Caslon in the early part of the eighteenth century. 
For the text is used the size known as " English," the songs, etc., being printed in small 
pica. The lines are numbered at the side. An English hand-made paper, with Shakespeare's 
crest and coat-of-arms for a water-mark, has been specially manufactured for this edition. 

The edition has been carefully produced under the supervision of Mr. A. H. Bullen, whose 
scholarly researches in the field of Elizabethan Literature have peculiarly qualified him for the 
task. A unique feature is the elimination of the great mass of notes which usually clog the 
pages of our great classic and impede the reader. Instead, the last volume contains new and 
original essays which supply in a comprehensive and readable form all the information that the 
student or private reader requires for the proper appreciation of the great dramatist. These 
essays are as follows : A Memoir of Shakespeare, by Henry Davey, F. G. S.; Ben Jonson's 
Views on Shakespeare's Art, by J. J. Jusserand; On the Influence of the Audience, by 
Robert Bridges, M.A.; The Religion of Shakespeare, by Rev. H. C. Beeching, M.A.; The 
Stage of the Globe, by E. K. Chambers; The Portraits of Shakespeare, by M. H. Spielmann; 
The Sonnets, by Rev. H. C. Beeching; Notes on the Text, by A. H. Bullen. 

The BOOKMAN (London): "The most beautiful and most desirable of all the library edi- 
tions of the works of Shakespeare. We can pay it no higher compliment than to express our 
opinion that it justifies its right to bear the imprint of Stratford-on-Avon." 

The ATHEN^UM : " The type is of luxurious size, set up on a page between eleven and 
twelve inches in height, and shows up with delightful clearness against the ample margin; and 
the whole is excellently bound, while it bears signs of being able to stand wear better than 
some elaborate editions of good repute." 



Of the Stratford Town Shakespeare 250 copies only were printed for Ameri- 
can subscribers, the published price being $75 net. For a very limited time, 
we offer the few sets that we now have at $35 net, delivery charges extra.

FIFTY YEARS OF 

"PUBLIC OPINION" 

THE BEST WEEKLY REVIEW OF WHAT 
MEN AND WOMEN SAY, DO, AND THINK 


EDITED BY PERCY L. PARKER FOUR CENTS (2o) WEEKLY 


PUBLIC OPINION (LONDON) was sug- 
gested by Sir Robert Peel when he said that 
" England was governed by opinion." It was an 
immediate success and won a big circulation both 
at home and abroad. To-day in circulation, in public 
estimation, and in its prospects it stands higher 
than at any period of its career. 

PUBLIC OPINION is a unique paper and 
after fifty years has no rival. It presents the cream 
of all the best thought in the best Papers, Maga- 
zines, and Books on all the Questions of the Day. It 
gives a rapid survey of the events of the week in 
the United Kingdom and in the great world outside. 

It is the busy person's paper, the paper for those 
who though busy want to know what is going on in 
the world. It keeps its readers well informed on 
what men and women are Saying, Doing, and Think- 
ing the world over about things that matter. It 
puts on record in a lucid way, in good print, and in 
the most convenient shape possible in a newspaper, 
the ideas which make for Social, Religious, and In- 
tellectual progress. 

Each week it gives lengthy and informing sum- 
maries of two of the most important new books, 
and so in the course of a year the reader is put in 
possession by direct quotation of the main features 
of over one hundred books. 

PUBLIC OPINION, therefore, saves time, 
labor, and money, for in all these ways it acts as 
(1) A NEWSPAPER ROOM. 
W A LIBRARY OF NEW BOOKS, and 
(8) A CHEERFUL AND WELL-INFORMED 
COMPANION. 

PUBLIC OPINION is non-party and seeks 
only reliable fact and information. It is a great 
acquisition to any home as it covers so wide a field 
and interests everyone for it is interested in every- 
thing and believes that everything is interesting. It 
goes all over the world and is an ideal present. 


WHAT MR. CARNEGIE SAYS: 

Mr. Andrew Carnegie, writing to the Editor in 
September, 1910, says : 
PUBLIC OI-INION has made a great impression on me. 
I would not now miss it for a great deal." 


A NEW YORK VIEW 

Dr. William Potts George, LL.D., of the Bedford 
Street Methodist Episcopal Church, New York, 
says : 
" I should like to say of your paper that it is the best 
that comes into my study, either English or American. 
I have a weekly English batch of papers and American 
papers galore, but yours sometimes contains more than 
all of them put together. Every page is readable." 


AN AMERICAN IN CHINA 

Mr. Robert E. Beddoe, M.D., an American in 
China, says : 
" It is just what I have been looking or for many 
yean a digest of news and opinions from the English- 
man's viewpoint. We Americans naturally form most 
of our ideas from our own journals, and, I am sorry to 
say, many good people have strangely overdrawn and 
incorrect ideas of what the English think of America 
and Americans. For this reason I could wish that your 
paper went to every American family every week. 
PUBLIC OPINION commends itself to me for its whole- 
some and moral tone.

SIGURD 






A Poem 






By ARTHUR PETERSON 






HpHE story of Sigurd, or Siegfried (of which the best-known 






* versions are probably the old Nibelungenlied, and Wagner's 






famous tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen), is one of the most 






celebrated of the world's epics. In the following version Sigurd 






is depicted as a young Norse rover, a wanderer not only by land 






but by sea, this latter innovation seeming to lend itself quite 






naturally to the established legend. 






The action takes place about the middle of the fifth century, 






that eventful period which may be said to mark the end of the 






ancient, and the beginning of the modern world. 






The Hon. RASMUS B. ANDERSON, formerly Professor of 






Scandinavian languages in the University of Wisconsin and 






Ex. U. S. Minister to Denmark, says of this book, in a letter 






to the author: 






" The book is a gem. . . . Your language is simply brilliant 






and your metre perfect. What delightful reading ! How I wish 






you would get millions of readers ; for Sigurd and Brynhild are 






our ancestral hero and heroine, and every American lad and lass 






should know the story by heart. You have surely rendered 






the public a distinct service, that should not fail of eminent 






appreciation."

A BOOK OF THE CHRIST CHILD 

By ELEANOR H. BROADUS 

A group of legends of the Christ Child, written not to

The Finest Edition of Shakespeare 
" at Less than Half Price 



STRATFORD TOWN SHAKESPEARE, ranking with the finest of editions de 
luxe, was printed at the Shakespeare Head Press at Stratford, which was especially 
established, under the direction of Mr. A. H. Bullen, to do honor to Shakespeare's 
memory by printing a worthy edition of his works in his native town. It is the only 
complete edition of Shakespeare's Works ever printed and published in his native 
town, and so will have for all time an interest and distinction placing it entirely apart 
from any other existing or future edition of Shakespeare. 



The 

Format 



Editorial 
Features

Opinions 



The set comprises ten royal octavo volumes. One thousand numbered sets, on English hand- 
made paper, have been printed, of which two hundred and fifty are for America. Each vol- 
ume contains a photogravure frontispiece, eight being portraits of Shakespeare, one of Richard 
Burbage, the chief actor of Shakespeare's time, and one of the Earl of Southampton, Shake- 
speare's patron, to whom his Sonnets are supposed to have been dedicated. The type is the 
original Old Face type cut by William Caslon in the early part of the eighteenth century. 
For the text is used the size known as " English," the songs, etc., being printed in small 
pica. The lines are numbered at the side. An English hand-made paper, with Shakespeare's 
crest and coat-of-arms for a water-mark, has been specially manufactured for this edition. 

The edition has been carefully produced under the supervision of Mr. A. H. Bullen, whose 
scholarly researches in the field of Elizabethan Literature have peculiarly qualified him for the 
task. A unique feature is the elimination of the great mass of notes which usually clog the 
pages of our great classic and impede the reader. Instead, the last volume contains new and 
original essays which supply in a comprehensive and readable form all the information that the 
student or private reader requires for the proper appreciation of the great dramatist. These 
essays are as follows : A Memoir of Shakespeare, by Henry Davey, F. G. S.; Ben Jonson's 
Views on Shakespeare's Art, by J. J. Jusserand; On the Influence of the Audience, by 
Robert Bridges, M.A.; The Religion of Shakespeare, by Rev. H. C. Beeching, M.A.; The 
Stage of the Globe, by E. K. Chambers; The Portraits of Shakespeare, by M. H. Spielmann; 
The Sonnets, by Rev. H. C. Beeching; Notes on the Text, by A. H. Bullen. 

The BOOKMAN (London): "The most beautiful and most desirable of all the library edi- 
tions of the works of Shakespeare. We can pay it no higher compliment than to express our 
opinion that it justifies its right to bear the imprint of Stratford-on-Avor.." 

The ATHEN^UM : " The type is of luxurious size, set up on a page between eleven and 
twelve inches in height, and shows up with delightful clearness against the ample margin; and 
the whole is excellently bound, while it bears signs of being able to stand wear better than 
some elaborate editions of good repute." 



Of the Stratford Town Shakespeare 250 copies only were printed for Ameri- 
can subscribers, the published price being $75 net. For a very limited time, 
we offer the few sets that we now have at $35 net, delivery charges extra.

DOING SOMETHING FOE THE DRAMA. 

That the drama (in this country) needs to 
have something done for it is an opinion wide- 
spread among thinking people. That its pres- 
ent state is parlous is a fact too obvious to 
need any detailed demonstration. Its diseased 
condition is marked (among other things) by 
anaemia, high temperature, congestion, impeded 
circulation (of ideas), flatulency, and dyspepsia, 
to say nothing of malignant growths in the vital 
parts. This congeries of ailments may make 
the physician smile, but the elasticity of meta- 
phor suffices to justify every one of the elements 
of this complicated diagnosis. One might even 
particularize by saying that the sex drama is 
neurotic, the sociological drama atrabilious, 
and comedy (especially musical comedy) afflicted 
with locomotor ataxia. The remedies suggested 
are as various as the diseases, but the public 
lacks either the courage to apply them, or the 
means to make them effective. We seem to 
need both a self-denying ordinance and a 
practicable plan for constructive work; thus far 
neither need is fairly on the way toward being 
satisfied. 

The craving which makes men yield to their 
desire for unwholesome food and deleterious 
drink is much like the craving which makes 
them the supporters of imbecile or mischievous 
stage-productions. They know that these things 
are harmful in the end, but they know also that 
they are just what will satisfy the immediate 
appetite. It takes a pretty serious danger 
signal to make the glutton or the drunkard 
pull up, and it takes an uncommon degree of 
resolution to impel the debauched theatre-goer 
to mend his ways. In both cases also there is, 
besides the element of personal responsibility, 
an element of social responsibility that has even 
less chance of being properly heeded. The 
appetite grows by what it feeds on, no less in 
the moral than in the gross material sense. The 
allurement of cakes and ale is not noticeably 
lessened by the presence of the virtuous ab- 
stainer, and his attitude seems more of a matter 
for jest than for profitable example. 

If the self-denying ordinance is too drastic a 
way of reforming our weak human nature 
(dramatically speaking), there is at least a con- 
siderable measure of hope in the constructive 



270 



THE DIAL, 



[Oct. 16, 



plan. There is surely a fringe of play-goers 
who might be lured from the altars of their 
false gods if temples of a purer worship were 
provided for them. All play-goers are not 
wedded unto their present idols, and many of 
them are restive under their bondage. It is 
the salvation of this fringe that should be the 
immediate object of workers in the interests of 
a better drama, and it constitutes a more numer- 
ous body than most people suspect. When it 
has become detached from the following of the 
vulgar commercialized theatre, there will be 
another fringe just inside it made ready for 
further missionary enterprise, and thus the 
good work may go on indefinitely. Festina 
lente must be the motto of all such efforts for 
dramatic regeneration, and it is not reasonable 
to expect that the syndicate will find its occupa- 
tion gone for a long time to come, but it is 
already attentive to certain ominous notes of 
warning that have been heard of late. 

The constructive problem (which is essentially 
a problem of education) may be attacked in two 
ways. The first of these, and the most obvious, 
is that of providing good theatres, animated by 
a higher purpose than that of money-getting, 
and letting the leaven of their influence work 
silently upon the public. If public support of 
the stage is a policy too alien to the spirit of our 
institutions to be hoped for, there is still the 
possibility of private support, in the form of 
guaranty or endowment, which may easily match 
the achievements of the European subsidized 
playhouse. We have urged this sort of enter- 
prise in and out of season, and our faith in its 
potentiality for good has within a year received 
notable confirmation in the deserved success of 
the New Theatre. We have also applauded the 
worthy aims which have characterized! Mr. 
Donald Robertson in his interesting experiments 
of the last three years. Moreover, there is a 
sign of promise wherever a good stock company 
is brought together, or wherever an individual 
manager sets resolutely to work in raising the 
standard of taste in his community. Mr. J. K. 
Williams, of S treat or, Illinois, is such a manager, 
and bears witness to his faith in these striking 
terms: 

I give it as the testimony of twenty-five yean of 
theatre management that nothing permanently pays 
except the building up of a sound and healthy taste in 
the patrons of a theatre. The flashy and trashy ' shows ' 
that merely entertain leave no after draft; they only 
exhaust and dissipate, create satiety and surfeit, and a 
craving for more and more spice, sensation, and vacu- 
ous excitement. The drama of merit alone creates a 
desire for more and better drama, and out of my twenty- 
five years of experience with one constituency I bring 



you the conviction that nothing but the best will last. 
\V I ifii I began my management twenty-five yean ago, 
to amioiuu-c :ui artistic performniift* in my town w:i- likt> 
putting up a sign for people to keep away. Now my 
chief perplexity is that I cannot get performances that 
are good enough for those who have been with me 
through these years." 

So much for the method of creating a place 
of repair, and attracting the public to it by 
degrees. The other constructive method is that 
of building up the right kind of audience for 
serious dramatic performances, thus creating a 
demand so pronounced that the managers most 
hardened in the old commercial ways will re- 
spond to it. Work in this direction is being 
silently fostered all over the country by lecture- 
courses and study-classes and university instruc- 
tion. It is being helped on by every dramatic 
reviewer who has a free hand and puts conscience 
into his writing. It is encouraged by every pub- 
lisher who ventures to print plays in the form 
of books. It is the avowed aim of the Drama 
League of America, organized this year for the 
express purpose of organizing the theatre-going 
public in the interest of plays that are worth 
while. There is much evidence that the public 
is ready to be thus organized, and upon this 
point we may quote from an article in the 
London " Nation " written in advocacy of an 
Ibsen season. 

" Nothing really stands in the way save the contem- 
porary passion for pageantry. Ibsen's middle-class in- 
teriors, his rigid adherence to the unities, his refusal to 
court variety by so much as a needless change of scene 
from one room to another, his choice of characters whom 
it would be a desecration to set forth with showy clothes 
or dashing manners these are probably still the chief 
drawbacks to his popularity. But we are nearing a phase 
of civilisation in which there is a public for the actor and 
actress who represent. A debased stage asks only for 
violent passions exhibited with a certain virtuosity. An 
actress must be able to play an hysterical movement as 
a violinist must play his cadenza. Or, if it esca]>es that 
worse phase of vulgarity, its aim is to display a charm- 
ing woman or a gallant man." 

The League of which mention has just been 
made came into existence as a woman's club 
movement, and was launched last April at a 
meeting of delegates from no less than sixty- 
three such clubs in and about Chicago. Its 
declared aims are " to co-ordinate the work of 
all associations and individuals already inter- 
ested in educating the public to appreciate and 
demand the best drama," and to awaken the 
public to the importance of the theatre as a 
social force and to its great educative value, if 
maintained on the high level of art and morals." 
Its most important work is to be done by the 
simple process of singling out the most praise- 
worthy plays visible at a given time, and urging

its members to see them. The recommendations 
take the form of bulletins sent to its members 
as promptly as possible after a first performance, 
which means, for example, that in the present 
month, something like ten thousand members of 
women's clubs in this city and its suburbs are 
being directly urged to see Mrs. Fiske in 
" Becky Sharp " and " The Pillars of Society " 
and " Hannele." Since the predisposition to 
take such advice already exists, it ought to be 
fairly evident to the most obtuse of managers 
that here is a force to be reckoned with, and 
that support of this kind is worth making some 
effort to gain. 

Such a plan of organizing, by no means the 
whole public, but a considerable section of it, 
in the interest of a high theatrical ideal, cer- 
tainly seems feasible, and we can see how there 
may be created by its agency " a body which 
shall faithfully support all plays receiving the 
League's, stamp of approval a body which 
shall consider itself pledged to ignore all plays 
deliberately catering to indecencies or that are 
of no literary or structural value." There are 
doubtless pitfalls in the path of such a move- 
ment, and the chief of these dangers is that the 
standards adopted may become too feminized or 
too finical. There must be a good deal of 
tolerance, of a kind, in such a propoganda 
not the tolerance which makes concessions to 
showiness or vulgarity, but that which does not 
balk at virility or the freest forms of portrayal 
of life, provided only they be sincere. The pres- 
sure of public taste has shaped the American 
novel into a shape so flabby, and given it a con- 
tent so devoid of vitality, that it offers a hor- 
rible example of what fiction ought not to be. 
The pressure to be applied to the American 
play must be of a very different nature, if our 
last case is to be any better than our first. The 
aim must be nothing less than truth, coupled 
with entire freedom of expression ; otherwise 
the effort will be futile, and the outcome not 
worth striving for. We must, for a long time 
to come, go to the schools of the Continent for 
our instruction, slowly and painfully learning 
from them the lesson that life itself, and not 
the trappings of life, is what the stage should 
exhibit.

CHATEAUBRIAND IN ENGLAND. 

I. 

A good while ago, one of the many writers about 
Chateaubriand, M. Victor Giraud, observed that 
there remained an interesting chapter in literary 
history to be written on the English origins of 
Chateaubriand's thought. " Let us not forget," he 
said, "that it was in England that Chateaubriand 
remained for seven years ; there that his religious 
crisis occured." At one time it seemed probable 
that the great romanticist would have an English 
biographer in the Rev. John Mitford, who would 
certainly not have failed to trace the English influ- 
ence upon him ; but that book seems never to have 
been written. Nor need we any longer greatly 
deplore the circumstance ; for a French writer well 
known to American readers, M. Anatole Le Braz, 
has, in a charming style that is neither trivial nor 
too erudite, inscribed this " interesting chapter." * 
M. Le Braz justly complains that most of the critics 
and biographers who have occupied themselves with 
his hero have not kept the fact well before them 
that from 1793 to 1800, at the very turning-point 
of his career, Chateaubriand lived either in London 
or in the environs of London, without revisiting 
France. In determining the dates of that long 
sojourn, little heed is to be paid to Chateaubriand's 
own statements : as Professor Dick has it, the author 
of u Memoires d'Outre-tombe" savait apprecier le 
vague des dates non moins que le vague des 
passions.^ It is very certain that, if " the American 
forest may be said to dominate the writer's works,"$ 
the years passed in England were fully as rich in 
meaning as the months spent on our own side of the 
Atlantic. 

It was, indeed, in the library of the Rev. John 
Ives, at Bungay, in Suffolk, that Chateaubriand 
received many of those impressions which he "worked 
up " later, in the sonorous prose of the " Natchez," 
the " M e'moires," and the " Voyage en Ame'rique." 
For the Rev. Ives was not merely a Hellenist and 
a mathematician, an excellent father and a genial 
host, a man of the cloth and a famous bottle com- 
panion, he was also a former missionary to the 
Americans. Like Rene", the good clergyman had 
feasted his eyes upon the grandest spectacles of the 
New World. 

"He had penetrated the savanas ; he had descended the 
rivers in his canoe; he had lived in wigwams and had 
smoked the calumet; he had practised at length the wild 
life of which the author of the ' Natchez,' (partially blocked 
out at this epoch), proposed to write the ' epic.' His was, 
in fine, the prowess that the cadet of Brittany had realised 
only in his dreams." 

As John Ives's guest, then, did Chateaubriand 
first make a close study of the narratives of Carver

and Bartram; perhaps, too, of Raynal and Charle- 
voix and the rest And yet it is surely too much 
to say, as does the latest writer on Chateaubriand, 
Mr. Francis Gribble, that everything in the French 
romanticist's writings about America belongs to 
Bartram, " nothing to Chateaubriand nothing, 
that is, except the flowing periods."* What should 
at least be evident to the most casual follower of 
Chateaubriand's career is that the chapters ''Amer- 
ica" and "England" are associated in more than 
temporal sequence. 

II. 

Chateaubriand's return from the Western World 
is an old story. In a cabin somewhere in the Blue 
Mountains, an English newspaper fell into his hands. 
Its edges were frayed, but its contents were far from 
stale reading for the wanderer. By the candle of a 
Pennsylvania mountaineer, the traveller read of the 
French King's flight, and of his arrest at Varennes. 
In spite of all his vagaries and contradictions, 
Chateaubriand was ever loyal to his order, to his 
King, and to France : it was in the nature of things 
that he should return to Europe, to serve in the 
ranks of the emigres. He suffered as well as served, 
as it fell out. It was his fate to be left for dead on 
the battlefield, and to pass through many another 
adventure before, ragged and broken in health, he 
made his way to England, the haven of the 
ci-devants. Meantime, Ren had made a marriage 
of convenience ; his bride was one Mile, de Lavigne, 
an heiress. f Let us try to remember the existence 
of Mme. de Chateaubriand a grain more faithfully 
than did her unfortunate husband. Unfortunate he 
surely was, one may glance, in passing, at the 
picture which he has left of the life he led in his 
lodgings in Holborn : 

" I was devoured with hunger ; I burned with fever ; 
sleep had deserted me ; I sucked pieces of linen which I 
had soaked in water; I chewed grass and paper. When 
I passed the bakers' shops, the torment I endured was hor- 
rible ... I could have eaten not only the provisions, but 
the boxes and baskets in which they were packed." 

Even so, Chateaubriand's plight was no worse than 
many a compatriot's. There is no reason for 
doubting his tale that he landed at Southampton 
with only thirty louis in his pocket. Had Chateau- 

* " Chateaubriand and his Court of Women." By Francis 
Gribble. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons, 190!). In the 
earlier chapters of this interesting book Mr. Qribble is in 
too great haste to get Chateaubriand out of America, out 
<>f England, that he may ensconce him in his "Court of 
Women. 1 ' Mr. Gribble coolly denies (pp. 35-37) that 
Chateaubriand ever called upon George Washington, at 
Philadelphia, though telling evidence of that visit has been 
found at the Congressional Library at Washington, and twice 
laid before the reading public (" Publications of the Modern 
Language Association, 11 June, 1907). 

t There has very recently appeared (Paris: Emile-Panl) 
volume, " Les Cahiers de Madame de Chateaubriand Pub- 
lic's Inte*gralement avec Introduction et Notes, par J. Ladreit 
de Lacharriere.'' It is almost twenty years since M. I'uilhes 
discovered these memoirs, which remained in the hands of 
Chateaubriand's descendants; but even M. Pailhes never 
published them in their entirety. That act was left to M. 
de Lacharriere. The "Cahiers" make a readable supple- 
ment to the " Me'moires d'Outre-tombe." 



briand been " romanticising " this part of his own 
life, he would have made the amount smaller by at 
least one-half. And yet, on occasion, the writer did 
unmistakably " touch up " the record of his English 
exile. Story-tellers by profession seem almost always 
to forget that the plain truth is as romantic as their 
fairest and remotest fancies. But Chateaubriand 
had always too high a regard for appearances; 
and, besides, he had more preoccupations than 
that of the writer who seeks only to interest 
his public. Most of all he sought to prove Ren 
unique, as different from other men as Rousseau 
himself, and no less different from Rousseau. 
England teemed, in post-revolutionary times, with 
French gentlemen reduced to giving language les- 
sons; most of them, according to Chateaubriand 
himself, were thoroughly incompetent. And did he 
not write in the " Essai sur les Revolutions," in the 
chapter, " Aux InfortuneV' that he who is of high 
rank (d'un ordre superieur) must regard as the 
greatest of all possible misfortunes to be obliged to 
renounce the free exercise of his faculties (de 
renoncer aux facultes de son dme) and to. pass his 
days in teaching his neighbor's stupid children their 
a, b, c's (a faire des mots aux stupides enfants 
de son voisin) ? "Such a man would sooner die of 
hunger than procure, at such a price, the necessaries 
of life." Holding these views, it is small wonder 
that li.Tir concealed the true nature of his occupa- 
tion during the years of his obscurity. 

Let us not, however, dwell upon the bad taste of 
that concealment It must have seenu-d to him a 
too banal matter, his going down from London to 
take a place in Mr. Brightley's private school at 
Becles, in sleepy old Suffolk: a county that was to 
remind him almost startlingly of his own Brittany. 
He spins, then, a yarn about a society of Suffolk 
gentlemen, headed by the Rev. "B. S." (Bence 
Sparrow), who were engaged in antiquarian re- 
search. These supposititious antiquarians engaged 
Chateaubriand to decipher the thirteenth-century 
manuscripts, composed in French, which formed 
one part of the collections. This, at least, is one of 
the romances to be found in the " Me'moires." The 
true story of Chateaubriand's stay at Becles is set 
down in the new book by M. Le lira/.. and it is 
interesting enough to have engaged Chateaubriand 
himself. Here one may read (not for the first time) 
that Chateaubriand's incorrigible pupils called him 
" Monsieur Shatter brain." Other pupils were the 
ladies of the nearby country-seats, all of them 
incontinent to have their French pronunciation 
polished off by the well-born and handsome young 
man who called himself in America, "M. de 
Combourg." 

The tale of his little flirtations at Becles is inno- 
cent enough. Ren was, however, more than a pro- 
fessor of French conversation and French literature. 
He posed, too, as an amateur disciple of Lavater. 
The ladies at Bence Sparrow's rectory gave him 
unsigned specimens of their handwriting, and he 
amused them with the characters he deduced. He

numbered the sheets of paper on which the samples 
of handwriting were offered him ; he then drew 
pleasing portraits of the various numbers. Num- 
ber two was, he said, " a very pretty young woman. 
Something of the levity and the elegance of the 
Nymph. Witty ; a lover of pleasure, a sa mode ; 
sometimes capricious ; a little peevish, even. Capable 
of hate and of love. Generous and good. No great 
talker." What woman would not be delighted to 
be found by so charming a French teacher and 
graphologue, capable de haine et d'amour, witty, 
withal, and combining the levity and the elegance 
of the Nymph? 

III. 

Chateaubriand's traffic with the fair women of 

Suffolk was not confined to readings of their chiro- 

graphy. (His stay there had, too, its interludes of 

botanising, for, like Rousseau andBernardin before 

him, he occupied himself with herborizing : "armed 

with his scissors, style, and glass.") For, after 

Becles, came Bungay : " twin-village " to Becles ; 

and at Bungay was enacted the comedy which is at 

once the most absorbing and the most serious of all 

the English comedies in which Chateaubriand was 

a principal. It was at Bungay that John Ives 

dwelled, the clergyman already spoken of : he 

whose earlier parish had lain over-seas, the father 

of the Charlotte whom Chateaubriand immortalized 

by loving ; and Charlotte was, beyond a doubt, the 

" Clarisse " of one of Chateaubriand's rare poems : 

" Oui, je me plais, Clarisse & la saison tardive, 

Image de cet age ou le temps m'a conduit ; 

Du vent k tes foyers j'aime ta voix plaintive 

Durant la longue nuit ..." 

Chateaubriand was twenty-seven when he wrote 
his verses. Clarisse (Charlotte Ives, that is) was 
but fifteen, " Juliet's age," M. Le Braz reminds 
us. To the Juliet of the clergyman's daughter, 
Chateaubriand played Romeo. Those who know 
the portraits of the Frenchman need not be told 
how well he looked the part. And doubtless he 
acted it as well as if there were no Madame Romeo 
pining for him somewhere in Brittany. 
IV. 

At Bungay, as at Becles, Chateaubriand sup- 
ported himself by teaching his language to the 
Islanders. It was, doubtless, this occupation of his 
that brought him into intimate relations with the 
Vicar's daughter ; though long before the climac- 
teric winter of 1795-1796 he was, if one may believe 
his own story, hospitably received in the Vicar's 
home. "The young lady questioned me about 
France, about literature ; and she asked me to indi- 
cate a course of reading for her. She wished partic- 
ularly to know the Italian authors, and begged me 
to give her some notes on the ' Divine Comedy ' 
and the ' Jerusalem.' " So the " Mdmoires." 

We have seen that at BeclesRectory Chateaubriand 
came to give lessons in French conversation and 
remained to demonstrate his proficiency in chiro- 
graphy. At the Vicarage, he went a stage further. 
Everything conspired to establish the young man on 



terms of peculiar intimacy with this household. There 
was a triple bond between the young stranger and the 
bibulous parson : literature, port wine, and America. 
And the Vicar's family was in the goodness of its 
heart disposed to shelter and repose the stranger 
fallen on his seven lean years. Seated at the Vicar's 
table, where there was always plenty, and never a 
touch of ostentation, the exile found himself at home 
as nowhere else. Ensconced in the snug ingle- 
nook, he felt that true contentment which belongs 
to us only when we are sure of our welcome. He 
felt himself no longer " an object of curiosity." At 
his ease there, he was in a mood to be delighted by 
every action, every trait, every expression, of his 
generous hosts. " If I could have been told that I 
was to spend all the rest of my days buried in the 
bosom of this retiring family, I should have died of 
pleasure," he confessed in his " Mdmoires," many 
years after. The Vicar's daughter joined to the 
charm of youth the quality of intelligence. " Like 
the Francesca and the Paolo of the 'Divine 
Comedy ' that they pored over, it was in bending 
their heads over the same book that they took pos- 
session of one another's heart." Sinful, all this, on 
the part of the Paolo the Romeo the Rene' 
who had a wife in France (albeit a wife only in 
name). Still, it is worth while to remember that 
Chateaubriand regarded himself at this period as a 
doomed man. Had not Dr. Goodwyn, author of 
the " Dissertatio Medica de morte Submersorum," 
in some sort abridged his responsibilities, in warning 
him that his life was to be a short one ? But, what 
is most significant of all, Rend was Rend ! 

For these were the days when Chateaubriand was 
working at his American novels, and elaborating 
the histories of Rend and Cdluta. Perhaps he was 
hardly deceived in feeling that a curse lay upon 
him and on all he loved. 

" To love and to suffer was the double fatality that he 
imposed upon whomsoever approached his person. Cast 
into the world like a great misfortune, his pernicious influ- 
ence was communicated to those about him. It is thus that 
there are trees, beautiful to the eye, to breathe whose air or 
to enjoy whose shade is death." * 

Chateaubriand was fully persuaded of this fatality ; 
fully convinced that he exerted his baneful influ- 
ence, willy-nilly. II y avoit dans Rene quelque 
chose de dominateur, qui s'emparoit fortement de 
I'dme. It would seem that the obsession of self was 
so strong with Rend that he believed it to extend to 
all those in his circle : nor was he altogether wrong. 
And, just as his readings in the library of the re- 
turned missionary may well have spurred him on to 
the production of his pseudo-scientific chapters, and 
furnished him with much of the material for his 
narratives of American travels, real and imagined, 
so would his relations with Charlotte seem to have 
suggested more than one passage of those same 
travels and of his American novels. " In my opin- 
ion," Professor Dick has written, " a great part of 
the idyll of Bungay passed over into the novel of

4 Rene*,' the person of Chateaubriand adding itself 
to the person of Lucile, and confusing itself with 
her to form the strange personage of Amelie. 
Ame'lie, in so far as she is Rent's sister, is Lucile ; 
in so far as she is his sweetheart, she is Charlotte." 
And at the conclusion of his hook on Chateaubriand 
in England, M. Le Braz expresses, quite without 
presumption, his hope 

" to have established that AtaU u Charlotte, and that ' Lei 
Amours de deux Sanvages dans le Desert,' if they had, per- 
haps, the original object of ' painting ' the fraternal ardours 
of Lncile and of Francois-Ren^ in the desert of Combourg, 
did not find their essential theme, and were not fixed in 
their definitive form till Love, Love without epithet, Lore 
in the singular, had enriched the heart and the genius of 
Chactas, returned from America. It is Charlotte, again, 
who, in the ' Natchez,' appears to us with the features of 
OeMuta whose very name seems to have been formed from 
hen. It U she, finally, who, in her third and final incarna- 
tion, is brought to life under Greek skies to follow Endore

crt astre charmant, rose in the poet's imagination, not from 
the clear horizons of Hellenic Arcady, but from the ' con- 
fused and vapoury ' distance of Arcadian Bungay." 
M. Le Braz is, like Chateaubriand, a Breton like 
him, a poet. 

V. 

In following the fortunes of Charlotte Ives as a 
literary inspiration, we must not altogether forget 
the unlucky Charlotte of real experience. Chateau- 
briand never lost the memory of Charlotte's large 
dark eyes. Memory, indeed, was all that was left 
to him after the denouement of the little tragi- 
comedy. A fall from a horse from his favorite 
white pony, it may well be laid him up toward 
the end of the winter of 1795-1796. An accident to 
your hero, a not too serious accident, is ever a finish- 
ing touch to your romantic pieces. U ne faut jurer 
de rlen . . . And the young French teacher, suf- 
fering from his unhorsing, was cared for at the 
Vicarage. By turns they nursed him, the worthy 
port-soaked clergyman, the gentle mother, and 
brown-eyed Charlotte, " who was an excellent music- 
ian." The clergyman told all over again the tale 
of his American adventures. Mrs. Ives took the 
place of the aged woman who was so soon, in dying, 
to lead back into the fold this erring sheep (J'ni 
pleure, etj'ai cru). Charlotte Ives read to him 
sang to him listened to phrase-making out of the 
" Natchez." It was as pretty a diversion on a 
penny whistle as anything in " Richard Feverel " 
while it lasted. 

Without being wealthy, the Vicar of St. Mar- 
garet's was removed from want. Like his wife, too, 
he seems to have been unworldly in his plans for 
his daughter. Her happiness came first: that much 
is certain. Nor did this couple forget (nor their 
daughter, either) that the young Frenchman whom 
they befriended was, while a pedagogue by trade, 
a peer of France by birth. In fine, they were 
resolved to make it a happy family an eighteenth- 
century entente cordiale. Chateaubriand was on the 
point of going to London to read the proof of his 
first book. Let us turn to the " Mlmoires ": 



"'Sir.' she [Mrs. Ires] said in English, youbehold my 
confusion : I do not know if Charlotte pleases you, but . . . 
my daughter has certainly conceived an attachment fur yon. 
Mr. Ives and I have consulted together: yon suit us in 
every respect. We believe yon will make onr daughter 
happy. Von no longer possess a country . . . what is there 
to take you back to France? Until you inherit what we 
have, yon will live with us.' 

" Of all the sorrows that I had undergone, this was the 
sorest and the greatest. I threw myself at Mrs. Ives's feet ; 
I covered her hands with my kisses and my tears. >h>- 
thought that I was weeping for joy, and . . . stretched her 
arm out to pull the bell-rope ; she called her husband and 
daughter. 

' Stop ! ' I cried. ' I am a married man !' " 

Thackeray wrote, it will be remembered, 

" Now Charlotte was a married lady, 
And a moral man was Werther." 

In Chateaubriand's romantic case, the situation 
was reversed. 

VI. 

A sordid ending for the tragi-comedy, an ending 
not without grim humor. But let us proceed to the 
anti-climax. Life is seldom without a variety of 
these. Let us, then, look in upon the wedding of 
Charlotte Ives, on the seventh of April, 1806, to 
Samuel Sutton, later Rear-Admiral. No, on second 
thought we will do well to absent ourselves. We 
will not attend, either, the subsequent meetings 
of Mrs. Sutton a widow with three sons and 
her first lover: school-teacher no longer, but now 
Ambassador of France. The romance is deflowered ; 
if it be true that George Crabbe, the Suffolk poet, 
had it in mind when he composed his poem of 
" The Deserted Wife," that need not surprise us, 
what subject wouldn't Crabbe have used, had the 
fancy possessed him?* But one does not care to 
linger over this subject. Who would contribute to 
those inky streams of sentimentality and pruriency 
poured out by latter-day writers about Chateau- 
briand? 

I have exceeded the limits of a review, yet started 
only to review the book with mention of which this 
paper was begun. For it is pleasant to see it de- 
monstrated as demonstrated it is on every page 
of M. Le Braz's volume that a close personal 
study of a very indiscreet man of genius may lead to 
something better than the accumulation of details, 
now scandalous, now simply trivial. The new con- 
tribution to our knowledge of the man and the 
craftsman during the most critical period of his 
career does more than yield to future biographers 
numerous interesting personalia. The reader of 
M. Le Braz returns to the old-fashioned romances 
of Chateaubriand so vitally important in the his- 
tory of nineteenth-century fiction, so eloquent and 

This little-known tale of Crabbe's remains in MS. See

pp. 440; 515-516. See likewise "An Pays d'Exil de 
Chateaubriand," pp. 208 teg. The meeting between Chateau- 
briand as Ambassador and Mrs. (not " Lady ") Sutton seems 
to have taken place at London between April and September, 
1822 ; it was the significant date of June 16, 1822, that the 
Rev. Crabbe set to the first page of his MS. poem.

so vivid in themselves with new zest and a

think of Rene', judged on his own confessions, one 
can but be charitably disposed toward the deceiver

ness of his most recent chronicler. It is a charm-

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A SIMPLE TEST OF WIT AND HUMOR has been dis- 
covered by the Simplified Spelling Board. In the 
current issue of the " Simplified Spelling Bulletin " 
occurs an editorial entitled " Their Penury of Wit," 
which gives one to understand that advocacy of 
simplified spelling argues a capacity for wit and 
humor in the advocate, whereas opposition is indi- 
cative of a lack thereof in the opponent ; for " humor 
implies a tolerance of mind, a sense of human limi- 
tations, an absence of conceit, a kindly, genial 
atmosfere, in which understanding and good nature 
unite to keep the mind level and democratic, but 
undeluded." Therefore, "persons who commit 
themselvs to the wholly unintellectual idea that a 
common human invention and custom like English 
spelling, can not be, and ought not to be, improved 
in any way, are by the very conditions of their ex- 
istence deprived of wit and humor." Fortunately 
the same editorial page contains by chance an ex- 
ample of wit, or at least of sarcasm, as conceived 
by the genially tolerant simplified speller. Referring 
to the summer session of the Iowa State Teachers 
College, the good-natured, level-minded, and demo- 
cratic writer says : " In the Bulletin giving the 
courses for the Summer Term of 1910 twelv pro- 
fessors are enterd each as ' hed of the department ' 
in which he works, and one lady is described as 
' hed critic ' in the department of training and 
teaching. Can such things be, and overcome us in 
the Summer Term, without our special wonder? 
Can it be that these teachers use their heds learn 
with their heds, criticize with their heds ? What will 
become of a college where the teachers use their 
heds even in spelling?" We ourselves are "over- 
come," and shall henceforth rarely attempt to be 
facetious at the expense of simplified spelling. 



THE NEW OXFORD MOVEMENT, as it may prove 
worthy of being called, under its present masterful 
Chancellor. Lord Curzon of Kedleston, promises to 
put fresh life into that ancient seat of learning, to 
do away with some of the time-honored absurdities 
in its administration, and to bring it more closely 
in touch with the outside world. The Chancellor's 
"Principles and Methods of University Reform," 
issued seven or eight months ago, has been followed, 
after thorough study of the subject on the part of 
the Hebdomadal Council, the supreme governing 
body of the University, by a hundred-page volume 



of recommendations of its own. Between the two, 
the Chancellor and the Council, many rumors have 
come into being concerning possible future technical 
and commercial courses to be offered at Oxford, and 
concerning the more than possible dropping of Greek 
as a compulsory study. But we still hope that the 
remorseless march of "progress," industrial and 
practical, impatient of tradition and abhorrent of 
sentiment, will spare for a few generations longer 
the venerable honors course in litterae humaniores 
that is thought to-day to have equipped for their 
present high and influential positions many men 
prominent in both houses of Parliament, in the 
civil service at home and abroad, and in journalism, 
to say nothing of those more strictly devoted to 
learning and literature. London and Leeds and 
Birmingham have schools and colleges for scientific 
and technical and commercial studies; let Oxford 
and Cambridge preserve as long as possible the 
atmosphere and the traditions that are of so much 
more value to the world than any " get-there-quick " 
curriculum of bread-winning electives. 



A QUESTION OF BRISKNESS IN BOOK CIRCULATION 

is involved in the Grand Rapids Public Library's 
report of book renewals for the past year. Only a 
little more than three and one-half per cent of the 
books issued for home use were renewed at the end 
of two weeks for a like period ; and yet the librarian 
adds : " It is the unanimous opinion of the heads of 
the departments that it would be advisable to abolish 
the renewing of books, and to issue all books, except 
7-day books, for a straight period of four weeks, 
without renewal." Would not this considerably 
increase the number of unsuccessful applications for 
desired works ? The bulk of the books that circulate 
at all are drawn, at one time or another, by the 
" general reader," as we like to call him ; and to 
lengthen the retention period would be to curtail the 
general usefulness of the books. Moreover, would 
it not also prove, in some degree, a discourager of 
diligence and an encourager of waste of time ? With 
a month before one in which to read a book, the 
chances are more than a few that it will not be even 
opened until the third week, and perhaps not opened 
at all. Long ago the Boston Public Library abol- 
ished renewals altogether, making two weeks the 
inexorable limit, with results apparently not un- 
satisfactory. ... 

THE JAPANESE CONCEPTION OF POETRY, as 
expressed by Baron Takasaki, who for twenty-five 
years has held the high position of chief of the 
poetry office, or, as we should say, poet laureate, 
merits attention. He says : " Uta, or poetry, is 
nothing but the human heart; poetry is born with 
man, the Japanese uta with the Japanese and Japan. 
There is nothing more absurd than to try to learn 
how to write poetry ; we have only to make our 
own soul nobler and truer, and that is poetry. To 
give it a voice seems to me a secondary sort of 
thing; if we have our own voice, we should sing,

as simply and truly as the bird or the wind. . . . 
Poetry is not an art : I protest against its becoming 
artificial. Poetry is not to be made, but sung. 
Poetry is nothing but the true heart." The short 
poem of thirty-one syllables, so common in Japanese 
literature, has a simplicity and spontaneity in accord 
with this definition of poetry, and seems to be writ- 
ten, or uttered, by persons in all walks of life, as 
the natural and inevitable mode of expressing a 
striking or beautiful thought. The Mikado himself 
is said to be a skilled maker of these bits of verse, 
some thousands of which are now credited to him. 
But Baron Takasaki's definition of poetry as " noth- 
ing but the true heart " is, with all its fine sugges- 
tiveness, rather too vague to be useful. 



TUB CLOSE OP A FORTY-YEARS LIBRARY RECORD 

came with the recent death of James L. Whitney, 
who for almost forty-one years had been connected 
with the Boston Public Library, and had held the 
office of librarian for four years, from 1899 to 1903. 
A college graduate (Yale '50) and throughout his 
long life a close student and something of a writer 
and editor, he trained himself for librarianship, so 
far as he had any training, in the book business, 
being for years one of the proprietors of the Old 
Corner Bookstore in Springfield, Mass. Entering 
the service of the Boston library in 1869, he con- 
cerned himself especially with the perfecting of its 
catalogues and with the study and arrangement of 
its manuscripts. His catalogue of the Ticknor lib- 
rary of Spanish works is widely known and is highly 
valued for its scholarly excellence. The only survivor 
of the seven more or less remarkable brothers and 
sisters of whom James Lyman was one of the most 
gifted is now Mr. Henry M. Whitney, librarian of 
the Blackstone Memorial Library at Branford, 
Connecticut. Josiah Dwight Whitney, the geologist, 
and William Dwight Whitney, the philologist, were 
of this famous family, the father being Josiah 
Dwight Whitney of Northampton. 



GLIMPSES OF GREATNESS, in the flesh, living and 
moving before us, we are nearly all ready to scramble 
for and, if necessary, to suffer considerable crushing 
and bruising for the sake of obtaining. Can one 
imagine anything more enviable than to find oneself 
in the position described by Mr. Ford Madox Hueffer 
in the October " Harper's Magazine " ? It was once 
his fortune doubtless his too-little-appreciated 
fortune as a boy to have Carlyle describe to him, 
at his grandfather's request, the occasion on which 
he, Carlyle, had gained a near and leisurely view of 
Schiller and Goethe drinking coffee together, under 
a May tree in bloom, in a garden restaurant at 
Weimar. By the judicious bestowal of a thaler 
upon a waiter he had obtained the privilege of don- 
ning the servant's white apron and ministering to 
the wants of those two famous men as they sat, in 
court dress, with wigs and swords, at a damask- 
covered table. To have seen Shelley plain has, we 
know, been accounted a scarcely believable happi- 



ness. To have seen Schiller and Goethe plain, and 
to be privileged to speak to them, if only as a waiter, 
and to have them speak to you again, or even do 
nothing more than graciously nod in reply and per- 
haps bestow a modest trinkgeld, must be almost the 
pinnacle of bliss. And it is something to have seen 
the man (and that man Carlyle) who saw Goethe 
and Schiller. In fact, some might rate Mr. Huef- 
fer's good luck as the greater. 



A MAKER OF MILITARY NOVELS that have a con- 
tinent-wide if not a world-wide popularity relates 
some passages of personal history, under the title 
" Thirty Years of Pencraft," in the current " Lip- 
pincott's Magazine." ''The few months spent in 
'61 in front of Washington," says the writer, whom 
it is almost superfluous to name as Captain Charles 
King, " with my father's brigade, had filled my 
heart with enthusiasm for the volunteers, especially 
the men of Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Vermont, 
with whom we were associated. Even to enter West 
Point, it was hard to leave them." In its author's 
opinion, " Between the Lines " contains some of his 
very best and strongest writing, notably " the de- 
scription of the great cavalry fight on the right flank 
the third day of Gettysburg." As so often happens 
when a romancer introduces a bit of veritable real- 
ity into his story, this stirring scene was pronoun- 
ced by at least one prominent critic "a mythical 
combat," and it was the consequent dispute upon 
this point that sent the sales of the book so quickly 

into the thousands. 



THE TRAVELLING LIBRARY AT THE COUNTY FAIR 

now vies, in Vermont and Minnesota, with pigs, 
pumpkins, and pink lemonade (and several other 
things) in courting the attention of the rural public. 
At White River Junction, Morrisville, and Ludlow, 
in Vermont, and at Waseca, Worthington, Mankato, 
Austin, and elsewhere in Minnesota, travelling 
libraries, especially selected for the entertainment 
and the instruction of farmers and their families, 
formed a part of this autumn's attractions at the 
annual cattle show," as it is still generally called 
in rural New England. The Minnesota plan was to 
exhibit at each fair two twenty-five-volume libraries, 
one of practically useful agricultural works, and the 
other of miscellaneous and entertaining literature. 
Vermont added a pictorial section to its libraries, 
which were of three kinds, study-club libraries, 
school libraries, and general libraries. 


THE RECENT PASSING OF AN OLD-TIME PUB- 
LISHER, Joseph Abner Harper, calls to mind the 
founding of the house of Harper nearly a century 
ago, or ninety-three years, more exactly. The

of the four brothers who laid the foundations of the 
present great establishment in Franklin Square. 
Entering the house in 1852, he maintained his 
active and useful connection with it for thirty-five 
years, devoting his energies especially to the educa-

tional publications of the firm. Those of middle age 
can recall the Harper imprint on many a school-book 
thumbed by them (not infrequenlty with tears and 
groans) in the never-appreciated halcyon days of 
childhood. But the advent of the specialist in text- 
book manufacture brought to a close, for the time 
being at least, the Harpers' activities in this depart- 
ment of their business, and Joseph Abner Harper 
retired to a quiet life. The death of this repre- 
sentative of an older order and more primitive 
methods in the publishing world is regretted even 
by those who were unacquainted with him. 

AERONAUTICAL EFFECTS IN LITERATURE may 
now be watched for with increasing chances of suc- 
cess in the quest. Several years ago Professor 
Simon Newcomb gave us his ingenious and fascinat- 
ing study in aeronautical fiction, "His Wisdom the 
Defender," and Mr. H. G. Wells has also distin- 
guished himself in this field. What the automobile 
has been to the popular and prolific Mr. and Mrs. 
Williamson, and to countless other story-writers of 
the past decade, the airship is likely to be to the 
fiction-maker of the near future. And, by the way, 
considering the matter of aeronautics in its larger 
relations, we are reminded of Sir Hiram Maxim's 
prediction in his introduction to Mr. R. P. Hearne's 
lately-published " Airships in Peace and War." He 
believes that what electricity was to the last century 
in its marvellous progress, aerial navigation will be 
to the present century. 



A SPLENDID TRIBUTE TO JOHN HAY'S MEMORY

of this college year, did well to emphasize the fact 
and to urge upon them the desirability of right 
habits of reading. They were exhorted to read for 
pleasure and to read for power. " Read some book 
for no earthly reason except that you want to," said 
he; "and the man who does not want to read at 
all may the Lord have mercy on his mind!" 



COMMUNICA TIONS. 

MACAULAY AND THE WRITING OF HISTORY. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The communication in your issue of October 1, 
regarding the present-day writing of history, in which 
the writer holds a strong brief for Macaulay as against 
the modern historian, has much of truth in it so far as 
it goes. The charm and effectiveness of Macaulay's 
style are universally admitted. It is true that under 
the sway of Darwin and his followers, there were some 
historical writers who once believed that history could 
be made a science. But there is a difference between 
history as a science and scientific methods in history. 



The intense specialization of research to-day has un- 
doubtedly resulted in the production of much dry read- 
ing material; and the disposition of the universities to 
print every doctor's dissertation is burdening library 
book shelves with many works which are of value 
chiefly as evidence of their authors' elementary training 
in the science of historical research, rather than as 
original contributions to historical knowledge. 

The weak point in your correspondent's communica- 
tion is not what he asserts, but what he omits. In the 
first place, Macaulay was a great literary artist, and an 
artist is the favored child of genius. There are few 
like unto him in many generations. Greece had but 
one Thucydides, Rome but one Tacitus, England has 
had but one Macaulay. The criticisms of Mr. Hutson 
lie at the threshold of the generation of the middle of 
the nineteenth century quite as much as at the feet of 
historical writers to-day. What of Macaulay's contem- 
poraries? Grote was a great and conscientious scholar, 
but his style is dull and pedestrian when compared with 
the vivid and vigorous style of Macaulay. What of 
the overladen, turgid rhetoric of Sir Francis Palgrave? 
And the labored rhetorical form of Merivale? Is 
Hallam brilliant or solid ? 

Again, the point of view of historical writing has 
changed since Macaulay's time. The thoughts of men 
have widened with the process of the suns. With the 
exception of Macaulay's brilliant third chapter, upon 
the condition of England in 1685, his history is purely 
political history. Now perhaps the most striking char- 
acteristic of historiography since Macaulay died in 
1859 is the fact that the bearing of economic and social 
phenomena upon history has been so largely recognized. 
The economic and social interpretation of history suc- 
ceeded the political interpretation of history during the 
last half of the nineteenth century. The point of view, 
as well as the things seen from it, have changed, and it 
was inevitable that the change should revolutionize the 
method and form of historical composition. Since 
Darwin, it has not been possible to write history as 
Macaulay and Michelet wrote it. Despite Mr. Hutson's 
strictures, the small obscure investigator of local history 
and of the fine points of history has his iises. Darwin's 
famous work upon " The Origin of Vegetable Mould " 
proved the wonderful importance of earthworms iu the 
economy of nature. So, too, the patient historical 
investigator of small things has his part in the larger 
economy of historical writing. The day has gone by 
of purely political or dynastic or military history. The 
ideal history would be the history of all the activities 
of an entire nation or people within a given period or 
country. Economic and social history is the response 
to this demand, and the end is not yet. Signs are not 
wanting that we are upon the verge of a psychological 
interpretation of history. The present vogue of Ferrero 
is largely due to this element in his Roman history. The 
late Professor William James's " Varieties of Relig- 
ious Experience " has already exerted an influence upon 
French and German historical investigation. It is cer- 
tain that an immense field of research along psycho- 
logical lines is open before the student of history in the 
future. It is to the young historian that this work must 
fall. How far the trained historian of the present can 
go astray in historical interpretation is shown by the 
late Father Denifle's failure to write the history of 
German mysticism in the sixteenth century. His 
" Luther und Luthertum in der Ersten Entwicklung," 
though written by a highly-trained historian, has serious

shortcomings, not so much because the author was a 
Catholic but because of bis lack of psychological insight. 

In the sphere of mediteval history in particular, the 
psychological interpretation of history will Hud a great 
field of activity. We yet know very imperfectly the 
history of Europe from the fifth to the eleventh cen- 
turies so far as the great mass of the people is concerned. 
The Laves of the Saints must furnish us information as 
to how the mitiares and minocres of the barbaric codes 
and the millions in serfdom looked at life in these great 
centuries of transition. 

Mr. Hutson seems to think that Macaulay has been 
cast down from his high eminence. I think it may be 
safely said that this is not so, and that he still retains 
the homage of the historical world. Freeman admired 
him greatly and endeavored to form his style after that 
of Macaulay, and Mr. James Ford Rhodes, in his recent 
volume of Historical Essays, has most interestingly re- 
counted his attempts to form his style of composition 
particularly after that of Macaulay. 

It comes back to what was said in the beginning. 
Macaulay was bom with the gift of consummate literary 
expression, even as the poet is born with high qualities 
of imagination and an exquisite sense of rhythm. The 
breed of modern historical writers has not degenerated 
(to go no further than the English-speaking world) in 
the persons of Lecky and Creighton and Hodgkin and 
Maitland and Parkinan and Mr. Rhodes. If we pass 
to France we are on even firmer footing. United with 
an inherited grace of style, modern French historio- 
graphy possesses a scientific thoroughness that is the 
peer of the scholarly world of to-day. There are pages 
of Renan that seem almost a miracle of literary expres- 
sion combined with patient scientific effort. Who that 
has read his marvellous character-sketch of the emperor 
Hadrian can doubt this ? Only the most careful analy- 
sis reveals the thoroughness of the research, so exquisite 
is the literary style. The first paragraph establishes the 
historical and geographical milieu, the information in 
which is borrowed from the life of Hadrian, Chapter 
XIX, in the Historiae Augustae. Then follows the unfold- 
ing of the general idea which Renan wishes to develop, 
that of the reintegration of the Roman world under 
the Antonines. The facts he cites to prove it are all 
derived from documents or monuments, especially the 
latter the remains of Hadrian's villa near Tivoli, the 
inscriptions and other vestiges of Roman culture in 
Africa, Egypt, Phoenicia. The activity of Roman 
municipal life in the second century A. D. is proved 
from the vast number of inscriptions in the Corpus In- 
scriptionum Graecarum. Finally, the entire account 
is closed with a masterly paragraph summarizing the 
whole. Macaulay himself would have envied the pre- 
cision of Renan's analysis, his constructive synthesis, the 
cogency of his reasoning, the exquisite grace of his style. 
Nowhere in historical literature, I venture to say, is there 
a finer example of the perfect combination of scientific 
historical research with the art of literary expression. 

The same observations are true also, though perhaps 
in less degree, of Fustel de Coulanges, Alfred Rambaud, 
Achille Luchaire, and Ernest Lavisse. These character- 
istics are universally recognized in the case of the first 
and the last. But who that has read Luchaire's four 
volumes upon Pope Innocent III. will forget his picture 
of the greatest of the pontiffs, or the description of 
medieval Toulouse ? In these volumes Luchaire con- 
cealed a remarkable erudition under the garment of a 
style woven without seam and almost matchless in texture. 



Even when we pass to Germany, proverbially the 
home of dry -as-dust historical prose, tin- writing of vivid 
and powerful history has its example. Ranke's prose 
is classic. Treitschke's Deuttche GcachichU is almost as 
brilliant and quite as partisan as Macaulay 's History of 
England. The limpidity of Giesebrecht's Kaiscrztit is 
equalled by the thoroughness of his scholarship. 

To sum up. English poetry has had but one Shake- 
speare; English prose has had but one Macaulay. An 
art like unto theirs was a gift of the gods. But is there 
not as great a charm in some sense a gi eater charm 
in that conscientious endeavor minutely to present his- 
torical truth without fear and without reproach, which 
is, as Coulanges finely said, the chastity of history ? 
The spirit of historical research was never broader or 
deeper than now, and that spirit is the spirit of truth. 
" Human affairs," said Richter, " are neither to be 
laughed at nor wept over, but to be understood." And 
to the truth of that utterance a host of historical scholars 
to-day are testifying, both in Europe and America.

THE JOURNALIZED SHORT-STORY: A MAGAZINE 

EDITOR'S VIEW. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

I am not pessimistic regarding the present state of 
the short-story in America. It seems to me that it is 
rapidly moving forward in an evolution which is clmr- 
acteristic of nil literary development. Speaking broadly, 
and not forgetting considerable noteworthy individual 
attainment, the short-story is now in its period of power; 
later will come the beauty of fineness. Just because 
the modern short-story differs from mere fictional nar- 
rative (whether sketch or tale) the story plot, with its 
emphasis upon complication and denouement, is quite 
primary and essential. The story is the big thing. 
Finish, style, literary appeal, are not fundamental to a 
yarn of grip and movement, but are superstructuraL 
They are, however, vital to a perfect, or even to a really 
good, short-story, whether its " body " be robust or 
delicate. If we must often choose between story and 
style, we choose story and turn elsewhere for style. 
Now and then we get both. 

Now here is where the journalistic short-story, so 
characteristic of the "new" magazine, is of value as a 
part in the general progress of the short-story teller's 
art : it exhibits a rapidly growing sense of what is vital, 
and hence interesting, in plot, in situation, in surprise, 
in character, in all the groundwork of a good (by which 
I now mean well-constructed, sincere, and interesting) 
short-story. So I do not decry the present-day emphasis 
upon structural vigor and movement. It is a very 
important youthful step which shall soon lead the short- 
story on to the height of literature. What I do decry 
is the opinion of many that this journalistic short-story, 
concoction of swift intrigue, of robustious tragedy, of 
loud comicality, is the best kind of short-story. It is 
only a good kind imperfectly wrought, through too 
great insistence upon power at the expense of truth and 
beauty an indictment which is justly chargeable to 
our whole national life. 

Let the " successful " writer of to-day add to plot 
and movement that charm of style, that purity of dic- 
tion, that inner spiritual light, which alone can infuse 
vigor with fineness. It is the next step and a necessary 
one if the American short-story is to be literature.

There are not enough delicately wrought yet vital stories 
to go around. Not all editors are victims of bad taste. 
But I am confident that we are moving surely in the 
right direction. All of this present-day seeking for 
" body," for vigor and action, must be regarded as our 
intense American desire to do a thing forcefully. By 
and by will come, for the short-story as for the novel, 
a general appreciation of and striving after the finer 
literary qualities, to which some of our writers of light 
and leading have already attained a few of them, 
alas, to the complete attenuation of " the story " itself.

IMAGINATION AND THE MODERN SHORT-STORY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In returning to me recently a few tales in which I 
had attempted to treat some South American experi- 
ences with a large blend of imagination, the editor of a 
widely-circulated journal stated that he could not use 
three classes of matter, fairy stories (meaning the 
supernatural) , romance, and tragedy. It seems to me 
that this statement is a good comment on Mr. Canby's 
interesting and able communication in your last issue. 
What in the world is there left to make short stories 
out of when the above things are eliminated ? There 
is really left only Fact. I think when Mr. Gradgrind 
died he was cut up like Romeo into twenty thousand 
bits and each one of these bits is now, not a star, but 
an American Editor. 

The failure of imagination, that accounts for the 
decline in the art of short story-writing, for style fol- 
lows imagination as daylight does the sun. Buloz, the 
great French editor, was once offered an article on God. 
" God !" he said. " There is no actuality in that." The 
American Editor only sees actuality in what is under 
his nose. Imagine Colonel Higginson's " Monarch of 
Dreams," one of the greatest short stories ever written, 
being offered to the editor of any present American 
magazine. It would certainly be returned to the author 
with pitying commiseration, and the advice to get in 
touch with the people. 

But humanity cannot get along without imagination. 
Expel it with a pitchfork, it will return. So our short- 
story writers stretch and dilate their facts until our 
magazines are a wild whirl of college Amadises, Ameri- 
can princesses, dress suits, automobiles, slumming, and 
Rockefeller millions. The total result is as unveracious 
as the Arabian Nights, and infinitely less full of 
meaning. 

There was a gradual culmination in the American 
short-story through Irving, Hawthorne, and Poe. There 
has been an accelerating decline ever since, save where 
the lift of Bret Harte came in. He gave the world a 
new school, compounding his art, as all the masters 
have done, out of a few grains of fact and an immense 
proportion of fancy. CHARLES LEONARD MOORE.

A GREAT FRENCH LIBRARIAN. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Permit me to add a few words to your comment on 
the death of Leopold Delisle. He was, at the time of 
his death, librarian of the library at Chantilly, which 
was bequeathed to the Institut de France by the late 
due D'Aumale, and had served in this capacity since he, 



in 1905, was dismissed from the office of administrator 
of the Bibliotheque Nationale, after thirty-four years of 
faithful, assiduous, and successful administration. His 
dismissal came like a bolt from a clear sky, and astounded 
his numerous personal friends as well as all whom he 
had assisted in his official capacity, by its quite apparent 
injustice. So far from being the cause of the difficulties 
which surround workers at the Bibliotheque Nationale, 
Leopold Delisle was directly responsible for the reforms 
that were introduced there during the years of his incum- 
bency, reforms that tended to make the vast collec- 
tions of that library available. It may truly be said of 
Leopold Delisle that he found the Bibliotheque Nationale 
a mob of books and left it a library indeed. He was a 
great administrator, a great librarian, one of the few 
whose names will go down to coming generations. But 
he was also a great scholar. To quote Fritz Milkan, in 
his necrology of Delisle in the September number of the 
Zentralblatt fur Bibliothekswesen : " It has long been an 
acknowledged fact, acknowledged by the consensus, not 
of France alone, but of the world, that the enormous 
progress of historical science during the latter half of 
the nineteenth century is due to no one else in so high 
a degree as it is to him." He was an example of the 
librarian and scholar combined, to whom the world of 
scholarship is indebted, not only for important contribu- 
tions to the advancement of knowledge, but for a suc- 
cessful administration of the world's largest library, an 
administration which resulted in opening to scholars 
resources which before his incumbency were inaccessible.

BIOGRAPHY AND SPELLING REFORM. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In the past few months you have had occasion to 
record the deaths of five distinguished men David J. 
Brewer, Wm. T. Harris, R. W. Gilder, William James, 
and " Mark Twain." You have paid them fit tribute 
as they severally departed. But you have failed to 
mention that they were all of them members of the 
Simplified Spelling Board, ardent advocates of a 
rational endeavor to make the English language fitter 
for service thruout the world. No doubt this oversight 
was accidental. No doubt it was due to the fact that 
they had each of them many other titles to public 
regard. 

But as you have more than once exprest your own 
desire to leave English spelling alone in its present 
chaotic condition, and as your comments on our efforts 
to remove a few of its more obvious absurdities have 
sometimes seemed to suggest that all simplified spellers 
were cranks and freaks, I ask your permission to remind 
your readers that men of the wisdom and of the varied 
attainments that you have credited to these five leaders 
of American life were willing to stand up to be counted 
in behalf of our cause. BRANDER MATTHEWS.

To THE POLE WITH COMMANDER PEAKY.* 

From the tropical jungles and sun-scorched 
plains of equatorial Africa, of which Colonel 
Roosevelt's latest book has been telling an inter- 
ested public many wonderful things, the atten- 
tion of that public is now called to the icy ter- 
rors and marvels of the Arctic by Commander 
Peary's account of his crowning achievement, 
the attainment, after almost a quarter-century 
of yearning and striving, of latitude ninety 
north. " The North Pole," as he entitles his 
record of this achievement, forms a fitting and 
satisfying sequel to those earlier narratives of 
his that have kept the world informed of his 
gradual approaches toward the final realization 
of his life's dream. It is such a book as could 
only be written once in the history of the world, 
just as the exploit it chronicles is one that is 
not likely to be repeated though any predic- 
tion as to this would manifestly be rash. At 
any rate, no first discovery of the North Pole 
will ever again be possible, and the publishers' 
chosen adjective for the book, " unique," is not 
out of place. 

The plan for this last and triumphant assault 
on the Pole embraced four principal features. 
First, the Smith Sound or American route, 
offering a land base one hundred miles nearer 
the goal than is otherwise attainable, was 
chosen; and, secondly, Cape Sheridan was 
selected to serve as a winter base, the "Roose- 
velt " being anchored there after her perilous 
passage of the Sound. The same choice of 
route and winter base was made, it will be re- 
membered, three years earlier, when the coveted 
prize was all but won in a dash to the then 
" farthest North." Third on this list of essen- 
tials comes the sledge with its team of Eskimo 
dogs, and fourth the Eskimo himself " for the 
rank and file of the sledge party." Besides the 
indispensable presence of a strong company of 
these hardy natives from Cape York onward, a 
smaller number served in the auxiliary sledg- 
ing parties when the final move northward over 
the ice began, and four actually accompanied 
Commander Peary to the Pole itself. These, 
with Matthew Henson, the faithful and experien- 
ced colored assistant, were the only sharers in 
the glory of their leader's success at the v.-ry

last. Of his band as a whole, all of whom but 
one (the lamented Professor Marvin, drowned 
in a lead covered with thin ice) he brought 
home in safety, the author writes : 

I was extremely fortunate in the personnel of this 
last and successful expedition, for in choosing the men 1 
had the membership of the previous expedition to draw 
from. A season in the Arctic is a great test of char- 
acter. One may know a man better after six months 
with him beyond the Arctic circle than after a lifetime 
of acquaintance in cities. There is something I 
know not what to call it in those frozen spaces that 
brings a man face to face with himself and with his 
companions; if he is a man, the man comes out; and, if 
he is a cur, the cur shows as quickly." 

The story of the expedition, from the " Roose- 
velt's" leaving New York, July 6, 1908, to 
Commander Peary's arrival at the pole, April >, 
1909, and the return of the party in tin- sum- 
mer of the latter year, is familiar in outline to 
every newspaper-reader. In more detail it is 
known to readers of the magazine that lias 
already published the greater part of the ex- 
plorer's narrative. But for the complete ac- 
count, with its one hundred and ten striking 
illustrations from photographs taken on the 
spot, eight of them skilfully colored, one must 
go to the book itself, a few further extracts 
from which will here be given. 

Again and again is the reader made to 
admire the grim determination and cool courage 
of the Arctic explorer. Not that any formal 
and deliberate accounts are given of obstacles 
overcome or dangers faced ; these things are to 
be read mostly between the lines, now and then 
in a passing reference or casual mention. For 
example, the fact that the author has for the 
last eleven years been obliged to make the best 
of his way about on feet that northern frosts 
have reduced literally to stumps, transpires in 
a natural if not unavoidable explanation of less 
than a line of print. And again, in a short 
passage, a few of the negative delights of Arctic 
sledging are brought within the reader's appre- 
hension. 

" It was so cold much of the time on this last journey 
that the brandy was frozen solid, the petroleum was 
white and viscid, and the dogs could hardly be seen for 
the steam of their breath. The minor discomfort of 
building every night our narrow and uncomfortable 
snow houses, and the cold bed platform of that igloo 
on which we must snatch such hours of rest as the 
exigencies of our desperate enterprise permitted us, 
seem hardly worth mentioning in comparison with the 
difficulties of the main proposition itself." 

On nights of especial danger, when the parting 
of the ice under the sleeper's chilly bed might 
precipitate him into the still more chilly water, 
the party slept with mittens on ; otherwise the

undressing for the night seems to have consisted 
of removing the mittens, which were then placed 
within instant reach. Not infrequently the 
only pause between two marches was for eating 
and a short rest, without sleep. Darkness there 
was none, of course, after the start had fairly 
been made for the Pole. 

The number and variety of mischances that 
had to be as far as possible guarded against, 
any one of which might have summarily defeated 
the object of the expedition, are something 
appalling to think of, so that it seems little 
short of a miracle that success was actually 
achieved. Such a conjunction of favorable, or 
not too adverse, conditions might not, even 
with the best of planning and foresight, be 
encountered again in centuries ; and only a man 
of long special training and of indomitable 
purpose would be able to take advantage of the 
opportunity. Colonel Roosevelt well says in 
his brief Introduction : 

" Probably few outsiders realize the well-nigh incredi- 
ble toil and hardship entailed in such an achievement 
as Peary's; and fewer still understand how many years 
of careful training and preparation there must be before 
the feat can be even attempted with any chance of suc- 
cess. A ' dash for the pole ' can be successful only if 
there have been many preliminary years of painstaking, 
patient toil. Great physical hardihood and endurance, 
an iron will and unflinching courage, the power of com- 
mand, the thirst for adventure, and a keen and far- 
sighted intelligence all these must go to the make-up 
of the successful arctic explorer; and these, and more 
than these, have gone to the make-up of the chief of 
successful arctic explorers, of the man who succeeded 
where hitherto even the best and the bravest had failed." 

The Foreword contributed by the editor of 
the "National Geographic Magazine " concludes 
a useful eighteen-page sketch of north-polar 
exploration from the first part of the sixteenth 
century, with a well-considered tribute to Com- 
mander Peary. 

" The prize of four centuries of striving yielded at 
last to the most persistent and scientific attack ever 
waged against it. Peary's success was made possible 
by long experience, which gave him a thorough knowl- 
edge of the difficulties to be overcome, and by an un- 
usual combination of mental and physical power a 
resourcefulness which enabled him to find a way to sur- 
mount all obstacles, a tenacity and courage which knew 
no defeat, and a physical endowment such as nature 
gives to few men." 

The author himself modestly ascribes his suc- 
cess " to experience ; to the courage, endurance 
and devotion of the members of the expedition, 
who put all there was in them into the work ; and 
to the unswerving faith and loyalty of the officers, 
members, and friends of the Peary Arctic Club, 
who furnished the sinews of war, without which 
nothing could have been accomplished." 



In addition to the attainment of the Pole, a 
small contribution was made to geography by 
the exploration of Clements Markham Inlet to 
its head, this being but a few days' journey 
along the coast of Grant Land from the winter 
quarters. Another minor event of considerable 
interest is related in the closing chapter. 

"MacMillan while taking tidal observations at Fort 
Conger on Lady Franklin Bay, to connect our work at 
Capes Sheridan, Columbia, Bryant, and Jesup with the 
observations of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition of 
1881-83, found still some remains of the supplies of the 
disastrous Greely expedition of 1881-84. They included 
canned vegetables, potatoes, hominy, rhubarb, pemmi- 
can, tea, and coffee. Strange to say, after the lapse of 
a quarter of a century, many of these supplies were still 
in good condition, and some of them were eaten with 
relish by various members of our party. One of the 
finds was a text book which had belonged to Lieutenant 
Kislingbury, who lost his life with the Greely party. 
Upon its flyleaf it bore this inscription : ' To my dear 
father, from his affectionate son, Harry Kislingbury. 
May God be with you and return you safely to us.' 
Greely's old coat was also found lying on the ground. 
This also was in good condition and I believe MacMillan 
wore it for some days." 

One notes with approval that the book con- 
tains only two references, brief and colorless, 
to Dr. Frederick A. Cook ; and Mr. Harry 
Whitney's name likewise occurs twice. Three 
appended papers give tidal and other observa- 
tions ; facsimiles of certain other important 
observations, and of original certificates relating 
to the polar sledge journey ; and a " Report of 
the sub-committee of the National Geographic 
Society on Peary's Records, and Some of the 
Honors Awarded for the Attainment of the 
Pole." An index and a large map conclude 
the volume. The handsome workmanship of the 
book, with its many fine illustrations, obtained 
in some cases under unusual difficulties, calls 
for unstinted praise. It is indeed a " unique " 
record of a heroic achievement.

THE LAW AND GOSPEL, or ART.* 



The difficulty of finding an appropriate and

from coming to the attention of the class of 
readers who would find most profit in reading

should be read by everyone interested in the 
fine arts. It is not, as the title would indicate, 
a technical treatise for the instruction of art 
students. Nor is its appeal solely to artists 
and art critics, though they may read it with 
advantage. The truth is, Mr. Holmes has writ- 
ten a very remarkable book. In it he has set 
forth the whole law and gospel of art, carrying 
the analysis further than other authors have 
done.*, and applying it with simple directness to 
the practical questions involved in making pic- 
tures and in forming an intelligent opinion of 
their merit. Such technical matters as enter into 
the discussion are dealt with in plain language 
requiring no special education or familiarity 
with studio terminology for its comprehension. 
A significant note is struck in the opening 
sentence of the Introduction : 

"The blunders which we continually make in our 
estimates of contemporary painting, and the incessant 
squabbles between painters themselves, do not argue 
that art criticism so far has been of much practical use, 
either to the world in general, or to the limited class of 
persons who might be expected to read it." 

Mr. Holmes then goes on to say : 

"So far as the general public is concerned, the 
(esthetic philosopher may be absolved for his non- 
success. If he has failed to teach it the principles of 
reason, judgment, and good taste, no other kind of a 
philosopher has been much more successful. Yet when 
we come to the restricted class of educated persons who 
have been closely connected with the Fine Arts in some 
capacity or other, the {esthetic philosopher has been 
more conspicuously ineffective. The musician and the 
man of letters no longer dispute except over trifles, 
but artists are still at open war over what would seem 
to be the very rudiments of taste: School fights with 
School and Society with Society." 

The reasons for this are admittedly not easy 
to give, and Mr. Holmes perhaps overlooks 
some of them in ascribing as the principal one 
the endeavor to formulate a canon of perfect 
ideal beauty as the foundation of artistic -ac- 
cess. There can be little room for doubt, how- 
ever, of the effect upon ideas respecting the fine 
arts, of reliance upon such a canon. Not only 
does the relativity of beauty result in great 
divergence of views as to the type itself, but, 
as is pertinently asserted in the book before us, 
the secondary effects of regarding a fixed canon 
of ideal beauty as a criterion have been " no 
less calamitous than its primary statement." 

" It was soon recognized by thoughtful minds that 
this canon not only failed to account for the admitted 
excellencies of many great works of art but was actually 
inconsistent with them. To explain the discrepancy 
< Truth to Nature,' interpreted in a thousand different 
senses, was called in; and until the latter half of the 
nineteenth century (when Truth to Nature ' began to 
occupy the field alone), the efforts of painters and critics 



alike were devoted to reconciling somehow these shifting 
opposites. The result has been utter .-liaos, disastrous 
to artists both directly and indirectly." 

Another stumbling block is found in the 
appeal to tradition : 

" The revival of any past tradition, however splendid 
its record, is a perilous business ; for unless it can be 
adapted to the decorative and intellectual needs of the 
period of its renaissance, it will be futile and pedantic." 

These words are eminently sound. So also 
are those with which the introduction closes : 

The true logical foundation of the Fine Arts is inex- 
tricably connected with their concrete function, mate- 
rials, and processes : and no abstract philosophising 
which has neglected these essential factors has produ- 
ced any fruit but fine words, conflicting judgments, and 
bad painting. It is upon the practical sciences of 
picture-making, of sculpture-making and the like, and 
not upon any group of abstract ideas, that the aesthetic 
philosopher of the future will have to erect the com- 
plete all-embracing theory which will enable artists to 
be peaceable, art patrons to be confident, and art critics 
to be unanimous." 

Though the time when such unanimity of 
opinion will prevail is seemingly far in the 
future, and widely varying views may be heard 
on every hand, those expressed by Mr. Holmes 
in this book are nevertheless in accord with 
those held by the small circle of the most emi- 
nent critics and connoisseurs of the present 
day. It is not the novelty of the views but the 
novelty and clarity of their presentment that 
make the book notable. The cogency of the 
reasoning is helped by the modesty with which 
these views are stated : the orderly plan upon 
which the work is laid out make the answers to 
many perplexing and oft controverted questions 
easy to be understood. 

In no other way can so accurate an impres- 
sion of the quality of the book be conveyed as 
by letting the author speak for himself. What 
could be more true than the following words ? 
Do they not go to the very root of the ques- 
tions, how should we paint? and how should 
we appreciate and judge paintings? 

"The true painter's emotion sums up and concen- 
trates his experiences in terms of paint, as the poet 
sums up his experiences in terms of rhythm. It seizes 
on the facts of the subject that are essential to pictorial 
expression and rejects all others. It emphasises these 
selected facts by all the devices of the painter's art, by 
rhythm of line, by the spacing and disposition of the 
masses, by light and shade, by colour, and by the very 
handling of the paint, till the result is a harmonious 
pictorial statement in which the various elements unite to 
serve the artist's purpose. 

"To make good pictures the painter needs the stim- 
ulus of emotion just as does the poet . . . We must 
never forget that the emotion which the painter has to 
cultivate is not tin- emotion of the poet, the musician, 
or the archaeologist, but the emotion which is stirred by 



1910.]

the pictorial aspect of things, and by that aspect alone. 
Whatever charm his subject may have for him by reason 
of its association with life or literature, he will make a 
bad picture of it if he allows the thought of this charm 
to come between him and the thought of its pictorial 
aspect." 

These conclusions are not mere dicta. They are 
the result of an extended inquiry that neglects 
neither the point of view of the artist nor that 
of the observer, that takes into consideration 
materials and technical processes as well as the 
metaphysical basis upon which sound thought 
must rest. Two more of them insistently invite 
quotation : 

" There is a constant hesitation in the popular mind 
as to whether the subject-matter of a picture, its inner 
significance, is more important than its technical expres- 
sion, its outward decorative aspect. There can be no 
real doubt as to the truth. As music conveys its mean- 
ing to us through the ear, so a picture must convey its 
meaning to us through the eye. It is through the visible 
attractiveness of its pattern of interwoven lines and 
tones and colours that we must be introduced to the 
significance of the images which the pattern includes. 
Decoration therefore has always a definite precedence 
over Significance in all good pictures. The moment 
the position is reversed; when a canvas appeals to the 
mind rather than to the eye ; when we think of the story 
it tells before our eyes have been gladdened by the 
attractiveness of its general appearance when Signifi- 
cance in short, has taken precedence of Decoration 
the thing is an Illustration, not a Picture. 

" The great problem in connection with the subject 
matter of painting is the relation of art to nature. 
Truth to Nature,' as we have seen, is one of those 
phrases which people are apt to use as if it were an 
infallible touchstone for works of art, without consider- 
ing for a moment that, had this been so absolutely, the 
great masters would not be great, and the best works 
of art would be those which most nearly resemble our 
modern colour-photography." 

It remains to be said that profound though 
the book is, it is most pleasant to read. Clear- 
ness of thought finds expression in unusual 
felicity of statement. Few of those who dip 
into Mr. Holmes's pages will be content to lay 
the volume aside without going through it more 
than once. FREDERICK W. GOOKIN. 



BY AND ABOUT MR. SHAW.* 

Mr. Bernard Shaw is more written about 
nowadays than writing. Two of his friends have 
discussed him brilliantly under the captions of 
"Heretic " and " Iconoclast "; no book on mod- 
ern drama or modern Socialism is complete with- 
out its fling at him or its eulogy. Finally 

* BERNARD SHAW AS ARTIST-PHILOSOPHER. By Ren^e 
M. Deacon. New York : John Lane Company. 

SOCIALISM AND SUPERIOR BRAINS. A Reply to Mr. Mai- 
lock. By Bernard Shaw. New York : John Lane Company. 



Mr. Chesterton has written a characteristically 
entertaining critical biography, which Mr. Shaw 
appraised most divertingly in the London 
" Nation "; and now Miss Renee M. Deacon has 
produced a sort of student's primer of Shavian 
philosophy, in which Mr. Shaw's dramatic 
theory, conception of life, and artistic function 
are laid down with an uncritical admiration 
unfortunate for the book but interesting as show- 
ing the complete recognition which its gifted 
subject has received. Heretic and Iconoclast 
of course, but also prophet ; to be defined in 
simple terms for those who read (because it is 
the thing) and run. 

Meanwhile, " Getting Married," " The Doc- 
tor's Dilemma," and " Blanco Posnet " are, 
according to the publishers, " in press," where 
they have remained, for reasons best known, 
probably, to Mr. Shaw, through divers pub- 
lishing seasons. The only play of Mr. Shaw's 
that has appeared recently in print is a suffra- 
gette farce in one act, intended for amateur 
production, entitled "Press Cuttings"; and 
even that has not been brought out on this side 
of the water. But in the meantime the staid 
columns of " The Times " have been often 
leavened by Shavian controversy. There have 
been tilts with Mr. Frohman over the Repertory 
Theatre, tilts with the tax-collector over Mrs. 
Shaw's income tax, tilts with various persons 
about Socialism, tilts with musical critics about 
Strauss, tilts, most frequent and most diverting, 
over the stage censorship. Sometime, per- 
haps, a book will be made of Mr. Shaw's contro- 
versies, and like Whistler's " Gentle Art" it will 
be a classic in its kind. For if nobody else can 
write Shaw plays, so nobody can match Mr. 
Shaw for keen, merciless, compact argument 
whirlwind argument, which states its adversary's 
position with cool, cruel irony, characterizes it 
with frank, brilliant impertinence, and proves 
the contrary with a sweep of splendid general 
izations supported by an almost impregnabi: 
array of detail. As Mr. Shaw puts it : 

"Why cannot a man write bad political econom t 
without coupling it with an attack on the Fabiai 
Society? The profit is naught; the retribution sudden, 
swift, and fearful." 

" Sudden, swift, and fearful " also the retribu 
tion exacted from those who fall foul of Mr 
Shaw's other favorite doctrines and institutions 
A brilliant example of Mr. Shaw's contro- 
versial writings is the little book entitled 
" Socialism and Superior Brains," which is all, 
it appears, that we are to have from him at 
present. It began in " The Times," as a reply

to Mr. W. H. Mallock and a defence of Mr. 
Keir Hardie ; it has grown to a Fabian publi- 
cation, containing the original correspondence, 
with explanations, and also an earlier reply 
to Mr. Mallock, on the same issues, first 
printed in 1894 in the " Fortnightly Review." 
Mr. Mallock's blunder, as stated by Mr. Shaw, 
is to conclude " that because ability can produce 
wealth and is rare, and men who are rich are 
also rare, these rich and rare ones must also be 
the able ones/' Mr. Shaw shows, with his 
customary cheerful completeness, that there is 
indeed no connection between the possession 
of wealth and "Superior Brains," that truly 
" Superior Brains " demand no such connection, 
that " Superior Brains " are at once wasted and 
overpaid, under present conditions, by the idle 
rich, and that they will find their paradise in 
Social-Democracy, where selfishness and stupid- 
ity will be disqualified, and ability may shine 
forth exactly as now, for a small salary and 
other valuable considerations. Mr. Chesterton 
has pointed out, among Mr. Shaw's character- 
istic merits, the rare union of intelligence with 
intelligibility. It is the wide recognition of this 
delightful quality that will cause many persons 
not particularly interested in " the rent of 
ability " or in the Fabian Socialist Series, to 
read Mr. Shaw's reply to Mr. Mallock just 
because it is Mr. Shaw's. 

To return for a moment to Miss Deacon's 
study of the "artist-philosopher": it has glaring 
faults, but it will serve, possibly better than 
more critical and comprehensive accounts of 
the matter, to equip the bewildered beginner 
with some idea of what this very modern drama- 
tist is driving at. It is an attempt, evidently, at 
purely objective treatment, an attitude rendered 
difficult to maintain by the peculiarities of the 
Shaw dramas. It is an attempt, also, to explain 
Mr. Shaw out of his own prefaces, a method 
not without disadvantages, particularly when 
indiscriminately followed. For instance, Mr. 
Shaw drops the truism that conflict is essential 
to drama, merely to lead up to the characteri- 
zation of the especial sort of conflict that he is 
interested in ; but Miss Deacon confines herself 
to showing that Mr. Shaw's plays involve con- 
flict. Here, as in other cases, a background 
of comparative criticism would have saved the 
situation. Miss Deacon is also fond of danger- 
ous superlatives such as that no dramatic author 
has insisted so strongly on the social side of 
life," or that the Shaw " view of woman is at 
once the most practical and the most trans- 
cendentally spiritual." But she emphasizes 



thoroughly some salient points of the Shaw 
gospel; and persons who have read the plays, 
the prefaces, and the Chesterton biognphy, 
and still want more light or tho.se \\liom Un- 
popular outcry over the complexity of the Shaw 
paradox has frightened are hopefully referred 
to this most recent presentation of the subject.

<;I:OVES DICTIONARY COM IM i TED.* 



Grove's " Dictionary of Music and Musi- 
cians," revised, enlarged, and brought down to 
date, is at last completed in five volumes, and 
will take its place in musical libraries as the 
only comprehensive and reliable reference in 
the English language. This statement, how- 
ever, must be taken conditionally, for if the 
new edition of Kiemann's Encyclopaedia shall 
be translated, then Grove will have a superior 
in critical discernment and thoroughness of 
research, as well as in scholarly ability. 

The fifth and concluding volume of Grove, 
just published, contains four notable biogra- 
phies, those of Tchaikovsky, Wagner, Weber, 
and Verdi, the latter being a considerable en- 
largement of the one in the first edition. The 
life of Tchaikovsky by Mrs. Newuiarch, his re- 
cognized biographer, is admirably written, and 
throws an interesting light upon his personal 
peculiarities and unfortunate domestic experien- 
ces. It is indeed in many ways the most valu- 
able biographical contribution to the dictionary. 
The most enlightening technical essays are those 
upon "Tone," "Time," "Temperament,"' 
" Tonic Sol-Fa," "Variations," and the "Violin," 
including the other members of the violin family. 

American readers will naturally look with the 
greatest interest for American subjects. These 
include life sketches of Theodore Thomas, 
Samuel P. Tuckerman the organist, Franz 
van der Stiicken, Alexander W. Thayer, George 
S. Whiting, Marie van Zandt, and Carl 
Zerrahn. It is satisfactory to observe that Mr. 
Thayer is at last recognized as worthy a place 
in Grove. The man who spent the leisure of a 
lifetime in preparing a life of Beethoven, and 
succeeded after most patient and elaborate 
research in correcting a thousand errors with 
which previous biographies are crammed, cer- 
tainly deserves this much of honor. His book

on Beethoven is as monumental an achievement 
as Spitta's life of Bach, and must always stand 
as the unquestioned and final reference. It is 
somewhat curious that it has taken two biog- 
raphers to write a brief sketch of Theodore 
Thomas. It is disappointing that the joint 
effort is inadequate and superficial, and throws 
no light upon the ability of the great conductor, 
his musicianship, his achievements, or his early 
labors as the pioneer of orchestral music in the 
United States. Furthermore, it is somewhat 
exasperating that the inconsequential collabor- 
ation is accompanied by the poorest of Mr. 
Thomas's portraits. The only remaining Ameri- 
can topic, which is not American except by 
adoption, is " Yankee Doodle," and this gives 
Mr. Carl Sonneck, the learned pundit who 
presides over the Musical Department of the 
Congressional Library, an opportunity to in- 
dulge in nearly four pages of queries and con- 
jectures that leave the reader at last in a fog 
about a subject which could be of no great 
consequence even if the truth about it were 
known. As many countries claim the nativity of 
"Yankee Doodle " as cities did that of Homer. 
Fortunately our own is the most shadowy of all. 
It is a little singular that Mr. Sonneck in his 
massive research was not moved to inquire if 
Beethoven had "Yankee Doodle " in mind when 
he wrote the vocal theme of the last movement 
of his Ninth Symphony. 

Grove's Dictionary has many omissions. 
Some subjects are overworked, some others 
have scant justice done them. But, taken as a 
whole, it is the only English dictionary we have, 
and it is our most important work of musical 
reference. To compile such a work is a well- 
nigh herculean task, and omissions must be 
expected and manner of treatment should be 
accounted for by the points of view. It is the 
work of many and skilful hands, and their work 
has been carefully edited by Mr. Fuller- 
Maitland, who has improved upon the previous 
volumes, bearing the distinguished name of Sir 
George Grove. All musical students and lovers 
of music will thank him for it. American musi- 
cians will be grateful that they have at last been 
recognized in an English Dictionary ; and if 
some of them have been omitted, and others 
slightly treated, they must wait with patience 
until the time comes when we may have an 
American " Dictionary of Music and Musi- 
cians." That time may not be so far distant 
as Dr. Friedlander, the Berlin- Harvard exchange 

professor, thinks. ^

Ax AMERICAN SERIES OF GENERAL, 
HISTORY.* 



The unquestioned success of the " American 
Science Series," and its recognized usefulness 
in presenting the various fields of science in a 
simple yet thorough manner, have led to an 
attempt to perform a like service to the realm 
of history. According to the publishers' an- 
nouncement, the "American Historical Series " 
is to consist of eight text-books written by 
American scholars under the editorial super- 
vision of Professor Charles H. Haskins, of 
Harvard University, containing "comprehen- 
sive, systematic, and authoritative " informa- 
tion, and, while preserving " descriptive as 
well as narrative " form, giving due atten- 
tion to "economic and social conditions and 
to institutional development." The plan is 
certainly ambitious, but the design is excel- 
lent and if successfully executed will not only 
present an evidence of American scholarship, 
but will offer the educational and reading 
public a series of very useful handy reference 
works on history. 

The first volume to appear is " Europe since 
1815," by Professor Charles D. Hazen, of 
Smith College. If Mr. Hazen's work were to 
be rated upon the basis of comparison with the 
older and standard brief histories of the period, 
it would in most cases suffer by its inferiority 
in vividness, or in picturesqueness of presen 
tation. Fyffe offers a rounded and attractive 
style, Miiller a journalistic and vigorously lib- 
eral interpretation, Andrews trustworthy facts 
from a fluent pen, and Seignobos an unusual 
lucidity that redeems his work from heaviness. 
The present volume cannot compete with these 
older works in their special excellencies ; and it 
does not pretend to do so. Its claim to recog- 
nition is rather that as a college text-book or 
a convenient reference book it supplies certain 
deficiencies of the works above-mentioned, and 
that for the student or the busy man it presents 
a readable and handy compendium for a defi- 
nite period of history. Briefly, this purpose is 
well fulfilled. The arrangement of the work 
is good ; chapter-headings and page-headings 
are well chosen ; marginal headings on each page 
aid in the search for a given topic ; fourteen 
unusually clear maps explain the text ; the index 
is in every way adequate ; and a well-selected 
bibliography refers to the better-known sources

and secondary works. The author has a faculty 
for clear, simple, and direct statement, and a 
condensation that at first glance is so smooth as 
to forbid realization of what must have been a 
tremendous labor, but that excites admiration 
as one comes to understand how well essential 
facts have been retained while the unessential 
have been eliminated. Mr. Hazen's work is 
unquestionably "comprehensive and systematic," 
and in so far as we have tested his facts it is 
" authoritative." 

The book begins with Europe at the close of 
the Napoleonic era, carries the story of national 
and international activities to the end of the 
century, and concludes with three chapters on 
Russia, Japan, and the Far East. It does not 
touch upon United States history. In so gen- 
eral a field, so briefly treated, no author could 
by any possibility be at once comprehensive and 
steadily entertaining. Thus, for the most part 
literary expression has been sacrificed to ac- 
curacy and detail. Nevertheless, Mr. Hazen 
is distinctly clever in brief characterizations of 
men, and there are many striking pen-pictures 
that should serve to fix a personality in the 
reader's mind. One may not always agree with 
these necessarily concise estimates, yet they 
show familiarity with biographies and in addi- 
tion are frequently original and always judicial. 
Much space is given, very properly, to English 
political movements, as well as to the wonder- 
ful colonial development of the last half of the 
nineteenth century ; and here the work seems 
less a compendium and more a living story. 
For, on the whole, the book is really a com- 
pendium, excellent in itself and likely to be 
very serviceable to teachers who use it as a 
base for more expanded description, but after 
all a great storehouse of fact. The history 
presented is largely on traditional models, 
mainly political, somewhat social where social 
movements have affected politics, treating 
the more obvious causes and effects, ignoring 
largely inner causes and relations, and devoting 
less attention than the publishers' announce- 
ment would indicate to economic and indus- 
trial development. The real merit of the work 
is that, taken all in all, it accomplishes the 
purpose of the series in offering a convenient 
and accurate hand-book. Certainly the series 
should prove acceptable and useful if the 
volumes in preparation maintain the standard 
set by the present one.

RECENT FICTION.* 

Mr. De Morgan's fifth novel is a surprise in 
several ways. It is only about half the average 
length of its predecessors, and it is an excursion 
into the realm of historical romance. It i> ;ii-<. \\- 
regret to say, far less interesting than the earlier 
ones. We trust that when we next meet the author, 
it will be again in the Victorian environment which 
is so peculiarly fitted to his genius. " An Affair of 
Dishonor " deals with the early years of the Restor- 
ation, and the London Plague, of which we hear at 
a distance, serves to fit the date exactly. Sir Oliver 
Raydon is an English country gentleman who has 
seduced the daughter of a neighbor. Challenged to 
a duel by the outraged father. Sir Oliver meets his 
antagonist, and kills him. The slaying is not hon- 
orable, even from the peculiar ethical standpoint of 
the duellist, for the mortal thrust is given after the 
enemy has already received a wound that should 
have ended hostilities. The murderer then wrestles 
with the problem of breaking the news to his mis- 
tress, and solves it by a cowardly evasion. Before 
she can learn of it, he has carried her off to another 
of his estates a remote and desolate place on the 
coast of the North Sea and there keeps her in 
ignorance of what has happened. The means of dis- 
closure is provided by the woman's brother, return- 
ing from Virginia, wounded and temporarily blinded 
in a sea fight with the Dutch, and cast upon the 
very shores of Sir Oliver's estate. Here he is nursed 
back to life and sight by his sister, who does not 
reveal to him the bond that is between them. 
Finally she lets the secret out, and it transpires also 
that she is the mistress of his host and not the wife. 
Even then neither of them knows of the father's 
murder, and it is only when the brother returns to 
his ancestral home that he learns the full extent of 
Sir Oliver's villainy. When the dreadful news at 
last reaches the woman, she takes flight from the 
man whom she must henceforth hate, although she 
cannot root out from her heart all of the old affec- 
tion. Then there is a duel between the brother and 
Sir Oliver, in which the latter is generously spared, 
then the death of Sir Oliver's wife makes possible 
a partial and tardy reparation, and the wronged

woman consents to marry him for the sake of their 
unborn child. Sir Oliver, who is an epileptic, comes 
to a miserable end, and the story trickles out to a 
conclusion reached in Mr. De Morgan's favorite 
way of indirection. The work has considerable 
power as a psychological study, but the theme chosen 
demands a much larger proportion of action than it 
gets, and the total effect is inclined to be wearisome. 
Probably the author could not write a poor novel if 
he tried, but the present production brings with it 
an acute sense of disappointment, so inadequately 
does it exhibit the gifts of humor and tender senti- 
ment that are the charm of " Joseph Vance " and 
" Somehow Good." It is an artificial piece of work 
at best, and the spontaneous geniality of the earlier 
novels is sadly missing from its pages. 

Mr. Hewlett's " Rest Harrow " is the third section 
of the delectable comedy (previously comprising 
" Open Country " and " Halfway House ") in which 
the vagaries of Jack Senhouse are described for us, 
and illuminated by copious outpourings of his thought 
in the form of monologue and epistle. We imagine 
it to be the conclusion of the whole matter, as far as 
the public is concerned, and it is just as well that it 
should be, because his eccentric individualism begins 
to pall, and his philosophy of conduct if it may be 
given so pretentious a designation has now been 
expounded with some superfluity of iteration. The 
present story, which is not much of a story at best, 
carries on the tale of his philanderings with Sanchia 
to the culminating night in the open, when she has 
come to him for a final refuge from the influences that 
seek to shape her life in the conventional mould. 

" They talked long and late, walking down the valley to 
the farmstead for bread. On this, with milk and fruit, they 
supped after Sanchia had bathed, and clad herself in one of 
his Moorish robes. Hooded and folded in this she sat at 
meat, and Senhouse, filled with the Holy Ghost, discoursed at 
large. The past they took for granted, the present was but 
a golden frame for the throbbing blue of the days to come." 

We can well believe the statement that Senhouse 
" discoursed at large." Coleridge once said to Lamb : 
" Charles, did you ever hear me preach ? " "I never 
heard you do anything else," was the prompt reply. 
We trust that the " blue of the days to come " is to 
be taken poetically, and not as indicating the hue of 
Sanchia's musings after her final break with society. 
We are of course glad that she is quit of Ingram, 
who is a brute, and no sort of mate for her, but we 
cannot help wondering if "the days to come" will 
not reduce her to Tennyson's condition after his ten 
weeks' sojourn at Fitz Gerald's "table of Pythagoras," 
seeming at first " a thing enskied," and finally fall- 
ing " from that half-spiritual height chill 'd," and 
turning to the fleshpots with zest. 

The author of " A Man's Man " has a marked 
talent for humorous description, and he is apt to let 
it get the better of his narrative intent. His picture 
of Coney Island may be given as a brief example. 

" Take Margate and Douglas and Blackpool, and pile 
them into an untidy heap ; throw in a dozen Fun-Cities from 
Olympia and half a score of World's Fairs from the Agri- 



cultural Hall; add some of the less reputable features of 
Earl's Court and Neuilly Fair ; include a race-course of the 
baser sort ; case the whole in wood, and people it with sallow 
gentlemen in striped jerseys and ladies answering exclusively 
to such names as Hattie, Sadie, and Mamie, reared up appar- 
ently upon an exclusive diet of peanuts and clam-chowder ; 
keep the whole multitude duly controlled and disciplined 
by a police force which, if appearances go for anything, has 
been recruited entirely from the criminal classes, and you 
will be able faintly to realize what Coney Island can do 
when it tries on a fine Sunday in summer." 

This choice bit of characterization is only one out of 
many; the story as a whole is consequently dis- 
jointed and episodical. Nevertheless, there is 
enough of a continuous story to hold the attention, 
while the author's cleverness and unfailing humor 
make us quite willing to forgo what would otherwise 
be our demand for a more closely-knit tale. Mr. 
Hay recounts for us the fortunes of one Hughie 
Marrable, who first appears as a student at Cam- 
bridge, and qualifies as a hero by an exploit at 
Bumps, whereby his crew wins the Head of the 
River. Hughie then knocks about the world for ten 
years, working his way for the fun of the thing, and 
mingling for choice in the most disreputable society 
he can find. All this is lightly passed over, and 
when we meet him at Coney Island he is on his way 
home to settle down as an English gentleman. His 
Quixotic championship of a distressed damsel results 
in his being shanghaied in New York, and shipped 
on board a tramp freighter which is to be scuttled in 
mid-ocean for the insurance. The scuttling is duly 
started, and the rascally crew take to the boats, but 
Hughie is left on board with three other men, the 
holes are plugged up, and the freighter, still good for 
about four knots, is taken to port. Thus end Hughie's 
Wanderjahre. After attending to the captain and 
his owner, and seeing them retired from society for 
a term of yea.rs, he finds himself confronted with a 
new sort of problem. He has been made the guardian 
of a girl a child when he had last seen her, a beau- 
tiful but wayward young woman upon his return 
and falls in love with her. He bungles the affair a 
good deal, so that the entire latter half of the book 
is needed to set things to rights. After keeping 
him on tenter-hooks long enongh to get the full en- 
joyment of the sport, Joey capitulates, and all is 
well. It is a very joyous book, and the writer's 
powers of characterization are much out of the 
common. 

"There was nothing in contemporary literature 
to compare with the serene, inspired audacity of 
Jane Holland." One might take this quotation from 
" The Creators " as a reasonably accurate character- 
ization of Miss Sinclair, who combines audacity with 
serenity in a fashion somewhat startling even to this 
liberal-minded generation of novel-readers. " The 
Creators " does not go quite so far in the direction 
of frankness as " The Helpmate" did, but it says a 
good many things that are usually left unspoken. 
In a way it takes us back to Miss Sinclair's great 
success, " The Divine Fire " for it has to do with

the mental processes and manifestations of genius, 
bat instead of a single example it gives us half a 
dozen (reckoning Nicky, a genius manqut, as one 
of the number), equally divided between the sexes. 
And its moral seems to be that genius takes heavy 
chances when it mates. The inherent difficulty in 
the problem of taking great novelists and poets for 
heroes and heroines is that it is so hard to make 
them live up to their imputed characters. No amount 
of assertion, however vehement, will convince us 
that anyone is a genius unless his own reported 
speech bears the unmistakable signs of inspir- 
ation. Miss Sinclair came within measurable dis- 
tance of solving this problem successfully in "The 
Divine Fire," but she comes considerably short of 
her aim in the new venture. Our chief impression 
of these writing-folk is that they are an irritable and 
neurotic set, conspicuously devoid of balance and 
common sense, rather than that they are the creative 
artists the author would like to have us think them. 
The book is immensely clever as to dialogue and 
personal description, and keeps free from long 
analytical divagations. These qualities make it un- 
usually readable, but something more than little 
touches are required for vital portraiture, and that 
something more Miss Sinclair is not quite able to 
command. The two important characters who are 
not geniuses (unfortunately married to the two who 
are) seem to be the most authentic examples of 
human nature in the whole book. 

Miss Louise Gerard is the author of a weird 
African romance called "The Golden Centipede," 
which in point of invention should make Mr. Rider 
Haggard anxious about his laurels. In point of 
description, it is rather suggestive of the African 
tales of Mr. Harold Bindloss ; and even recalls at 
times the masterly pages of Mr. Joseph Conrad. 
Unfortunately the book is badly-written, with fre- 
quent lapses from good grammar, and a most con- 
fusing use of pronouns. Over and over again the 
reader is puzzled to determine the antecedent of a 
"he" or a "him." The golden centipede of the 
title is only a symbol, but there are real centipedes 
in the story, of the most venomous and loathsome 
sort. There are other horrors, also, piled one upon 
another until we have something more than a surfeit 
of them. In fact, the story is one of the creepiest 
that we can recall, but the plot, ingenious although 
wildly extravagant, has a certain fascination which 
partly atones for the book's many defects of prolixity, 
cheap sentiment, and general literary shapelessness. 

Miss Wylie's "The Native Born" is a tale of 
modern India which, while it is lacking in the 
penetrative power of Mr. Kipling and Mrs. Steel, 
is fairly comparable with the works of those writers 
in its evidence of acquaintance with the conditions 
of Indian life, and in its successful working-out of 
an intricate plot. A brief prologue describes an 
attack upon an outpost, stubbornly but hopelessly 
defended by a handful of soldiers, ending with the 
last stand and final massacre of the whites. Then, 



after an interval of a score of years, the real story 
begins in the same place, once more an English 
station. Retributive justice, although tardy, had 
been effective, and a stern hand had dealt with the 
revolting natives. The present Rajah is a young 
man who had been rescued as an infant from the 
scene of vengeance, and retained in power under an 
English protectorate. When we meet him, he is 
a deeply interesting figure, a dreamy idealist, know- 
ing little of the conquering race by actual contact, 
but much by reading and reflection. He sees in 
the English a race of heroes, and when advances 
are made to him by the society of the station, is 
only too ready to receive his new friends with open 
arms. He speedidly falls victim to the wiles of 
a designing woman and the intrigues of a speculative 
adventurer. He dares to love the one innocent 
of the social gulf between black and white while 
with the other he engages in a mining scheme 
which he is persuaded to look upon as a philan- 
thropic enterprise for the uplifting of his people. 
When his eyes are opened, and he learns that 
the woman has tricked him, and that the man has 
plunged him into personal dishonor, he becomes once 
more the Indian prince, implacable in his hatred, 
and fierce in his fanatical zeal for revenge. He 
determines to sweep the English settlement out of 
existence, and it seems that their doom is sealed, 
when the extraordinary fact is revealed to him that 
he is himself partly of English blood. Thus is the 
final catastrophe averted, for with the Rajah's 
revulsion of feeling the revolt becomes powerless. 
Even the woman who has played with him expe- 
riences a change of heart, and her better self is 
aroused as she learns to appreciate his inherent 
nobility of character. The secondary interest of 
the narrative is provided by the relations of a man 
and woman, both English, who had also been pre- 
served as children from the massacre that had 
orphaned them both twenty years earlier. The 
whole plot is too intricate to be outlined in a few 
words, and so many revelations are crowded into 
the closing chapters that the effect is too confusing 
for the most satisfactory sort of story-telling. But 
the novel has both interest and power, and its tense 
dramatic climaxes indicate an unusual measure of 
literary skill. 

Our Civil War will doubtless provide subjects 
for the novelist for many years to come, and its 
possibilities still remain largely unexplored. In its 
superficial aspects, indeed, it has become fairly 
hackneyed, but the novels devoted to it that ex- 
hibit insight and breadth of treatment may alnmst 
be counted upon one's fiiipT-. " Ailsa Paige " 
comes very near to being included in this small 
group ; its claim would be indisputable were it not 
for its extravagant emotional coloring and its exces- 
sive sentimentalism. Mr. Chambers must pay some 
penalty for having become a " best seller," and he 
meets the demands of his swollen clientele by gush- 
ing rather more than is permissible, and by an

indulgence in over-violent contrasts of light and 
shade. The blend of brute and idealist that he 
gives us in his hero is not exactly calculated to 
appeal to the judicious, although his youthful read- 
ers will probably think it adorable. He is at his best 
in such a bit of dialogue as the following : 

" Curt ?" 

" Yes, dear." 

" If he surrenders 

" It makes no difference what he does now, child." 

" I know it. ... They 've dishonoured the flag. This is 
war is n't it ?" 

" Yes." 

"Will it be a long war?" 

" I think not." 

" Who will go ?" 

" I do n't know. . . . Soldiers." 

" I did n't suppose we had enough. Where are we going 
to get more?" 

"The people " he said absently "everybody, I sup- 
pose. How do I know, child?" 

"Just ordinary people?" 

" Just ordinary people " he responded quietly. 

If only the author had heeded the lesson of sim- 
plicity and restraint thus set himself he might have 
given us a masterpiece. As it is, he has given us 
a stirring story, told with much tenderness and 
sympathy, in which poetic suggestiveness jostles 
with harsh realism, and a group of intimately 
related and particularly interesting characters hold 
our attention closely. Mr. Chambers is at his best 
when writing romance with a historical background, 
and the present work is the best he has given us 
since his trilogy of novels dealing with the Ameri- 
can Revolution. 

Mr. David Graham Phillips " has it in " for the 
American woman. To readers of his earlier novels, 
this statement will not be a surprise, although most 
of them will probably gasp at the lengths to which 
the author has permitted himself to go in "The 
Husband's Story," his latest diatribe against the 
despised and abhorred sex. The following blossoms 
are culled from a single early chapter. " As a rule, 
women systematically lie to their husbands about big 
things and little." " Our women take incidental in- 
terest or no interest in their homes, in their husbands, 
in their children." " The American woman fancies 
she is growing away from the American man. The 
truth is that while she is sitting still, playing with a 
lapf ul of the artificial flowers of fake culture, like a 
poor doodle-wit, the American man is growing away 
from her." " The American woman is responsible 
for the dishonesty of American commercial life." 
" Is there any line of serious endeavor in which an 
American woman is interesting and helpful and com- 
panionable to a man ? " Later on, when the writer 
gets really warmed up to his task, the indictment is 
continued under other counts, so numerous and varied 
that we may at least admire the ingenuity that can 
think of so many mean things to say. Unfor- 
tunately, Mr. Phillips has not the equipment of the 
Juvenal he would like to appear ; his generalizations 
are too sweeping to be impressive, and the incurable 
vulgarity of his expresssion excites nothing but dis- 
gust. Posing as an indignant satirist, he is in fact 



nothing more than a common scold. The particular 
story which he tells here (or has told for him in the 
first person) is so utterly untypical even of the pluto- 
cratic society which he holds up to reprobation, and 
is given us with such crude coloring and strident 
emphasis, that it can make no appeal to any order 
of intelligence higher than that which is moved by 
the revivalist exhorter or the writer of yellow 
editorials. Of course, there are many people of that 
low order of intelligence by whom he may be taken 
seriously, and to such he must look for his public. 
There is no more mischievous kind of writing than 
that which thus uses a moral purpose to cloak an 
unbridled sensationalism based upon a wild distortion 
of actual human character.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

" The *&* the C0met S. T. C." 

a grand-niece was what some one once called the 
of Coleridge. late Mary E Coleridge, who said of 
herself, " I have no fairy godmother, but lay claim 
to a fairy great-great-uncle." In the memoir pre- 
fixed to " Gathered Leaves from the Prose of Mary 
E. Coleridge" (Button) Miss Edith Sichel speaks 
of Mary as the great-niece of Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge, and of the latter as the great-uncle of 
Mary. Whatever the exact degree of kinship, some- 
thing of the Coleridgean genius for both creative 
and critical work reappeared in the niece, whose 
short life of forty-six years (1861-1907) is memor- 
able to us for the novels, stories, essays, and poems 
that attested her lively imagination, her love of 
beauty, her warmth of feeling, and her pure delight 
in the creations of genius. To those who knew her 
personally she seems to have possessed, with all her 
shyness and whimsicality, great charm and many 
graces. The warmth of heart that made her the 
truest of friends was not inferior to the bright- 
ness of intelligence that enabled her to master 
Hebrew before she was nineteen and to become an 
early and ardent lover of Greek literature in the 
original. The short stories printed in " Gathered 
Leaves " are reproduced from " The Cornhill 
Magazine " and other sources, and, while they illus- 
trate her liveliness of fancy, her " human insight 
and poetic oversight," they also prove the truth of 
the criticism that her genius lacked sufficient talent 
to render it adequate support. Abruptness and 
obscurity and lack of construction mar her fiction. 
Her poems, mostly short and of slight texture, do 
her better justice. In literary criticism she knows 
what is good and how to commend it. Examples 
of these three kinds of writing are presented by her 
editor, and also Miss Coleridge's "Notes of the 
Table Talk of William Cory," the inspired teacher 
and erratic scholar of genius, as Miss Sichel styles 
him. Brief passages are also given from Mary 
Coleridge's letters and diaries, and a pleasing por- 
trait of her forms the frontispiece. Bright and

beautiful was her character, and these qualities 
mark the memorial volume edited with such loving 
sympathy by her friend. 

The application of the principles of 
and the irith. organic evolution to the explanation 

of human activities, especially those 
of a social character, is usually somewhat indirect 
and inferential. In a volume of the " International 
Scientific Series" bearing the title "Tin- Evolution 
and Function of Living Purposive Matter" (Apple- 
ton), Professor N. C. Macnamara attempts to make 
this application direct and specific. After tracing 
the structural evolution of the nervous system and 
the purposive behavior which this organ system 
subserves, through the animal series from Amoeba 
to man, the attempt is made to show that the activ- 
ities social, economic, and religious of a parti- 
cular group of the Irish people are the direct out- 
come of their evolutionary history. The result is 
interesting if not altogether convincing. The author's 
argument is developed in the following way. Roughly 
the first two-thirds of the book is devoted to an 
analysis of the biological literature on the progres- 
sive evolution of the higher "purposive" types of 
animal behavior. Beginning with the simple reflex 
activities of unicellular organisms concerned in the 
getting of food and the avoidance of harmful situa- 
tions, it is shown that as we ascend the animal series 
there is a continual and gradual increase in com- 
plexity of behavior, culminating in the higher 
animals in " conscious " action. Associated with 
the increasing complexity of behavior is an increase 
in the complexity of the so-called " purposive " 
structural elements (nervous system) of the body. 
It is then maintained that the accumulated effect of 
this evolution in the case of the end product man 
leads to the result that " the personal character 
or inherited instincts of human beings form a kind 
of substratum (unconscious) to their mental life, 
and constitute the real cause of most of their ac- 
tions." The last third of the book is given to an 
attempt to substantiate this claim by a detailed and 
very interesting account of the history of the Clan- 
cuilein Sept, a division of the Dalcasian tribe of 
Celts. Here the author is at his best. He writes 
of stirring events in a stirring way. One forgets 
the biological theory, which after all is rather 
intangible in its concrete application, in the joy of 
a well-told story of an interesting people. 



Incident of 






In hi " ch *tty and rambling "Acci- 
dente of an Antiquary's Life " (Mac- 
millan) Mr. D. G. Hogarth, already 
known as the author of " A Wandering Scholar " 
and other writings, relates some of the minor inci- 
dents of his twenty-three years' archaeological wan- 
derings and diggings in Greece, Macedonia, Asia 
Minor, Egypt, and Syria. The most important 
achievement of his that these miscellaneous reminis- 
cences touch upon seems to have been the toilsome 
but richly remunerative exploration of the site of 



the great Artemisium, or Temple of Diana, at 
Ephesus, which Wood, it* di-covi-rcr thirty years 
earlier, had left but partially explored. Gruesomely 
sensational are some passages of the author's 
description of his tomb-hunting and body-snatching 
adventures in Egypt, when, crawling on all fours 
in the dark, one often found the passage barred by 
a heap of dim swaddled mummies turned out of 
their coffins by some earlier snatcher of bodies ; 
and over these one had to go, feeling their 
breast-bones crack under one's knees and their 
swathed heads shift horribly this way or that under 
one's hands." Lucky was the temerarious grave- 
robber to escape with his life and no treasure from 
a stifling burrow " where rock was rotten and screes 
of loose chips, thrown down from plundered tombs 
above, might slip at any moment over the only 
channels of air and escape, and condemn us to the 
death of trapped rats in a most unworthy cause and 
most unpleasant company." The usual and highly 
acceptable accompaniment of pictures from photo- 
graphs, to the number of forty, is found in the vol- 
ume. As the informal record of a restless seeker 
for ancient relics, pursuing his quest somewhat in 
the spirit of the gamester or the mining prospector, 
the book is by no means so dry and dusty as the 
typical antiquary is supposed to be. 

Practical work Besides the repressive measures, 
in humane mainly in the nature of police duties, 

education. directed against cruelty to animals 

and to unprotected children, a greater need is for 
that educational work which will make repressive 
measures few or needless. Much has been done in 
this direction in the last decade, both by organiza- 
tions and individuals ; and much more is likely to be 
done in the future. In this noble work the name of 
Henry Bergh stands preeminent in this country ; 
and it is fitting that Mr. Roswell C. McCrea's ex- 
cellent report on " The Humane Movement in 
America" should have been " prepared on the Henry 
Bergh Foundation for the Promotion of Humane 
Education in Columbia University," and published 
at the University Press. The volume is a substan- 
tial one of 450 pages, and presents, besides a short 
biography of Henry Bergh and an account of his 
work, a considerable amount of matter relating to 
similar activities in this country. We are surprised 
at the omission of the very important work of the 
Humane Alliance, a chartered and still active organ- 
ization in New York City, founded and endowed by 
Hermon Lee Ensign, a genuine lover and protector 
of animals, who at his death ten years ago left his 
entire estate, of something like two hundred thous- 
and dollars, to the cause of the Humane Alliance. 
This society has done a remarkable work in the 
last decade in erecting marble drinking fountains, 
of artistic and serviceable design, costing about a 
thousand dollars each, in various towns, villages and 
cities throughout the country. Between one and 
two hundred of these beautiful fountains have now 
been given to the public or, rather, to thirsty

dogs and horses by this well-planned and well- 
administered benefaction. Some of Mr. Ensign's 
writings occupy a creditable place in humane liter- 
ature, and should have been included in the ample 
bibliographies in this volume. We are glad to see 
the unmistakable utterance of Dr. William James 
on the subject of animal vivisection given promin- 
ence here. The various State laws for the protec- 
tion of animals and children are summarized in a 
96-page appendix. The work is a valuable one, and 
can be made still more so by a needed revision, 
should a new edition be called for. 



New glimpses Two mo f \ interesting and charming 
of a charming personalities are disclosed in the late 
perionaiitv. Richard Watson Gilder's volume en- 
titled "Grover Cleveland : A Record of Friendship" 
(Century Co.). The term charming would have 
appeared absurd as applied to Mr. Cleveland fifteen 
years ago, so far as his personal self had become 
known to the world. He. was counted honest, cap- 
able, and obstinate ; he made enemies with the 
greatest ease, and seemed to have but few friends. 
His party was forced to accept him for its leader as 
the only man who had a chance to win, and did it 
with a wry face. But this stern, reserved, pugna- 
cious politician has been shown, since he retired to 
private life, to be a lovable man with charming so- 
cial qualities and what may almost be called a genius 
for friendship. Mr. Gilder's book is delightful in 
what it shows of his friend, and equally delightful 
in what it shows of himself, and the workmanship 
is that of the literary artist that we knew him to 
be. It consists of eighty-two brief anecdotes or 
sketches, most of them only a page or two long, 
with no connection except that each one illustrates 
some characteristic or quality or opinion or senti- 
ment of Mr. Cleveland ; and there is not one of them 
that is trivial or over-laudatory in tone, or unillum- 
inating. As one reads he seems to be brought into 
personal acquaintance with the subject, and both 
admiration and love grow with the reading. Mr. 
Cleveland's foibles and idiosyncrasies are shown, 
but they only set off his manliness, his true dignity, 
and his greatness. His reputation is meeting the 
great test, that of steady growth ; unlike many who 
have stood high during their active lives, he stands 
higher in general esteem as more is known of him 
and as his career is studied. Mr. Gilder's beauti- 
ful little book will help on that growth and appre- 
ciation. 

Familiar letters A S eniu . 8 for friendship and for eli- 
of mh century citing friendly letters from his absent 
celebritiei. friends seems to have belonged to 

Sanderson Miller, Esq., of Radway in Warwick- 
shire, man of letters, architect, and antiquary. "An 
Eighteenth-Century Correspondence" (Duffield), 
edited by Miss Lilian Dickins and Miss Mary 
Stanton, is made up of carefully preserved but never 
before published letters and parts of letters to Miller 
from such men of note as the elder Pitt, the Lyttel- 



tons, the Grenvilles, Lord Dacre, the Earls of Guil- 
ford, Coventry,' and Hardwicke, and many others. 
A sufficient account of Miller himself, with other 
editorial matter, is acceptably furnished by the 
careful editors. Inevitably there are many para- 
graphs, and even pages, in the four hundred and 
more of correspondence, that savor of the common- 
place. On the other hand an occasional new light 
is thrown on a historic character, as in Pitt's play- 
ful and sprightly style of addressing his dear friend, 
which shows him to have been more genial and less 
stern and formal than our mental picture of the 
great man. To Miller on the eve of a visit to 
Wroxton he writes : " May the grand Landskip 
Painter, the Sun, spread his highest colouring o'er 
the sweet scene, and the fairest Naiad of the Lake 
frisk all her frolick Fancy at the Cascade, and be, 
what you must ever think a pretty Girl, most 
charming in her Fall." From Deane Swift, near 
kinsman and biographer of the Dean of St. Patrick's, 
many lively letters are given. But the attractions 
of the book, to readers fond of familiar correspond- 
ence, are too many to specify in detail. By a natural 
and perhaps unconscious assimilation of eighteenth- 
century style, the editors allow themselves to use an 
occasional obsolete term, as in calling Miller an 
" antiquarian," and in referring to " an Austrian 
General of Irish extract." The work is fully illus- 
trated and indexed. 

It is almost impossible for an Amer- 

ican to ex P ress his fi f fc impressions 
of England. In vain he tries to 
convey to his untravelled countrymen the effect of 
English landscape, with its smooth velvety enclos- 
ures, lush hedgerows, old-fashioned villages, grey 
church-towers, ancient farm and manor houses, 
stately castles, and winding white roads. He is 
forced to admit that our own rural districts are as 
substantially built upon, covered with virtually the 
same crops, laid out in fields of the English pattern, 
and diversified with about the same amount of 
woodland. Yet even apart from buildings 
ordinary, gracious, ornate England differs abso- 
lutely not only from our own country but from 
almost all others in the world, with a quality and 
prodigious contrast almost indescribable. It so hap- 
pens that the English shrine most visited by Amer- 
ericans, the birthplace of Shakespeare is also 
in the heart of some of the most characteristic and 
beautiful of English scenery. Hence, many Amer- 
icans make their first, and sometimes their last, 
acquaintance with England by way of Stratford, on 
the banks of the river Avon. Accordingly, Mr. 
A. G. Bradley's book entitled "The Avon and 
Shakespeare's Country" (Dutton) bears a name to 
conjure with. Nevertheless, in his preface, the 
author acknowledges that he has given more space 
to the lower and less-known shores of the Avon 
than to the higher and more familiar reaches in the 
immediate Stratford district, and that he has done 
this with the transatlantic reader especially in mind.

Even more consistently engaging, associated with 
more inspiring landscape and no less rich in historic 
association, is the Avon near its mouth than the 
Avon at its source. Beginning with Tewkesbury, 
Mr. Bradley continues up-stream to Bredon, Eves- 
ham, and below the Cotswolds, with much historic 
detail and many alluring tales before reaching the 
town of Stratford and thence to Warwick, Kenil- 
wortli, and Rugby. Even if the text were less 
engaging than it really is, no one could be insen- 
sible to the thirty charming illustrations in color 
by Mr. A. R. Quinton. From the familiar view of 
Trinity Church at Stratford, which serves as frontis- 
piece, to the quaint Bubbenhall Mill of the closing 
chapter on Rugby, these pictures are full of the 
intimate feeling for English scenery that is so diffi- 
cult to put into words. 

The inauguration of a series like 
KtSSSL Me-". Duffield's Plays of To-day 

and To-Morrow " is a significant sign 
of the times. It means that the play is growing 
popular, like play-going; that people who do not 
go to the theatre insist upon having plays to read, 
while those who do go often hear something worthy 
of more than an evening's casual attention. The 
series opens auspiciously with two volumes contain- 
ing Mr. Rudolf Besier's " Don," and Mr. James 
Bernard Pagan's " The Earth." " Don " was the 
modern light comedy offering on last winter's pro- 
gramme at the New Theatre. The hero is a quix- 
otic young poet who, having taken a foolish wife 
away from her husband, brings her to his father's 
house, where his fiancee and her family are visiting, 
with the pleasing expectation that everybody will 
understand and sympathize. The characters in the 
two older generations are all types, and all amusing. 
If the comedy verges towards farce, there is no hint 
of melodrama. The four leading figures are closely 
studied, the dialogue is by turns amusing and mov- 
ing, and the central situation sincerely and vividly 
presented. Like " Don," " The Earth " is of En- 
glish origin our native drama seems to be more 
talked about than in evidence. It is a newspaper 
play based on the political aspirations of the head 
of a gigantic newspaper trust. Gaily ironic and 
brilliant is the presentation, vital the grip on real 
issues, masterly in utter absence of theatricality the 
denouement. Realism seems to be the note of the 
new school of dramatists truth to life, combined 
with a searching inquiry into life's problems. It is 
to adherence to this tradition that "Tin- Earth" 
owes its success as a stage-play both in London and 
America, and finally its place in a series like the one 
under discussion. 

Th,,torvo/an u>rhe History of the Telephone" 
epoch-making (McClurg), by that experienced his- 
torian of American inventions, Mr. 
Herbert N. Casson, gives in three hundred highly 
readable pages an untechnical account of the birth, 
growth, and flourishing maturity of this indispens- 
able aid to quick communication. It was in a small 



machine shop in Boston, in the summer of 1875, 
that young Alexander Graham Bell, professor of 
elocution and " visible speech," hit on the missing 
mechanism to his device for producing audible 
speech at an indefinite distance from the speaker. 
It was because he was more of an acoustician than 
an electrician that he was able to accomplish what 
professional electricians had pronounced to be im- 
possible. Dr. Clarence J. Blake, the noted Boston 
aurist, had given him the valuable suggestion of t In- 
human ear as a model to study and imitate in perfect- 
ing his instrument, and from this marriage of the 
two sciences of acoustics and electricity the hopeful 
offspring now known as the Bell telephone was 
born. The stormy history of the Bell Telephone 
Company, its winning of thirteen important law- 
suits, five of which were carried up to the Supreme 
Court, and of nearly six hundred lesser suits, with 
only two trivial contract cases decided against it, 
and its enormous growth in prosperity and activity 
of recent years, are all related in sufficient detail. 
Some account, too, of the chief men who have nidoi 
in building up this powerful corporation is given, 
and portraits and other illustrations are provided in 
abundance. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



Good health is simply a matter of physical and mental 
culture, declares Mrs. Emily M. Bishop, with all the 
amplifications that this assertion implies, in a handy, 
buckram-bound volume entitled " Daily Ways to 
Health" (Huebsch), which she begs the reader to allow 
"to be left around anywhere on the office desk, the 
kitchen shelf, the couch, the sewing table or the window 
seat," for hap-hazard perusal in spare momenta. Simple 
home gymnastics and breathing exercises, with helpful 
hints on the will to be well," make up the bulk of the 
book. Mrs. Bishop is an experienced teacher of health ex- 
ercises, well known to Chautauqua pupils, and her doc- 
trine is one to which most of us give too little heed. 

The Wisconsin History Commission publishes, as 
number three in its series of " Original Papers," a small 
volume by Mr. Theron W. Haight containing about all 
that can be learned concerning the careers of three broth- 
ers, Howard B., Alouzo H., and William B. Gushing. 
"Three Wisconsin Cushings" is the book's title. The 
first of the three, after creditable service in the Civil 
War, distinguished himself in fighting the Apaches in 
Arizona, where he was killed in action in 1871. The 
second was graduated from the U. S. Military Academy 
and acquitted himself well as artillery officer in the 
Civil War, rising to lieutenant colonel and rendering 
conspicuous service at Gettysburg, where he fell. The 
third brother received his training at the U. S. Naval 
Academy, and served brilliantly throughout most of the 
Civil War, especially distinguishing himself by sinking 
the Confederate ironclad, Aibemarle. He continued in 
the navy, with occasional promotions, until his death in 
1874 at the Government Hospital for the Insane. Por- 
traits, with facsimiles of letters, are provided, and the 
somewhat meagre annals attainable in regard to these 
brothers make a book of particular interest to war 
veterans.

NOTES. 



An entirely new and revised edition of Mr. Rossiter 
Johnson's well known " History of the War of Seces- 
sion " will be issued at an early date by the Wessels 
& Bissell Co. 

Current interest in aviation has led the Houghton 
Mifflin Co. to prepare a holiday edition of Mr. John T. 
Trowbridge's famous poein of forty years ago, " Darius 
Green and his Flying-Machine." Illustrations for the 
new edition have been made by Mr. Wallace Goldsmith. 

A new edition of Mr. Charles F. Lummis's " The 
Man Who Married the Moon," for some time out of 
print, is on the Century Co.'s Fall list. This new edition, 
enriched by an entirely new story, will be published 
under the title of " Pueblo Indian Folk-lore Stories." 

Richard Frothingham's " The Rise of the Republic of 
the United States " has been a work of considerable 
usefulness for nearly forty years. It was a pioneer work 
of its class, and still deserves readers, which will prob- 
ably be found for it by the tenth edition, now published 
by Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 

Professor Josef Redlich, of Vienna, is to give the 
Godkin Lectures this autumn at Harvard University, 
and he has chosen as his subject the history of the 
Austro-Hungarian Constitution since the compact which 
followed the war of 1866. The lectures, given in 
English, will be published later in book form. 

Mr. B. W. Huebsch, of New York, is about to pub- 
lish a poem of seven hundred lines entitled " The 
Happy Teacher," which was read before the Phi Beta 
Kappa society at Stanford University, last commence- 
ment, by our old and valued contributor, Professor 
Melville B. Anderson, on the occasion of his commen- 
cing Emeritus. 

Admirers of Walter Pater could hardly wish for him 
a more tasteful and dignified form of publication than 
is provided by the Macmillan Co. in their new library 
edition of his complete writings. Four volumes, giving 
us "The Renaissance," "Marius," and "Imaginary 
Portraits," are now at hand, and six more are to come 
at monthly intervals. 

A new and enlarged edition of Mr. Richard Robert 
Madden's work entitled "The United Irishmen: Their 
Lives and Times," now for nearly fifty years out of 
print, is announced by the Tandy Publishing Co. of New 
York. The new edition will be in twelve volumes, 
with a life of the author, notes, index, and bibliography 
by Mr. Vincent Fleming O'Reilly. 

Professor Walter Raleigh's " Six Lectures on John- 
son," to be published immediately by the Oxford Uni- 
versity Press, will include the Leslie Stephen lecture 
delivered at Cambridge; and Essays on the two-hun- 
dredth anniversity of Johnson's birth, Johnson without 
Boswell, Johnson on Shakespeare, Early Lives of the 
Poets, and Johnson's Lives of the Poets. 

Mr. A. Maurice Low has delivered to his publishers 
the manuscript of the second volume of his interesting 
and valuable work, " The American People : A Study 
in National Psychology," and has gone abroad for a 
short holiday. The second volume of " The American 
People " will be one of the leading publications on the 
Houghton Mifflin Co.'s list early next year. 

"The Collected Works of William Morris," in twenty- 
four volumes, under the editorship of Miss May Morris, 
is announced by Messrs. Longmans, Green, & Co. The 
edition, which will contain introductions, biographical 



notes, facsimiles, and frontispieces, will be limited to 
one thousand copies. The first four volumes, to appear 
in November, will be " The Defence of Guinevere," 
" The Life and Death of Jason," and two volumes of 
" The Earthly Paradise." 

Messrs. Cassell & Company announce a new art series 
entitled, " One Hundred Popular Pictures," consisting 
of medium-sized reproductions in the exact colors of 
the originals of one hundred masterpieces of painting. 
The series will be completed in twenty-five portfolios, 
to be published at intervals, at a low price, and delivered 
to subscribers in the same manner as a magazine. 

The two lectures given last year at Columbia Univer- 
sity by Senor Ramon Mene'ndez Pidal, under the aus- 
pices of the Hispanic Society of America, are now 
published by the Society in a handsome volume. Their 
subject is "El Romancero Espanol," which is dealt with 
historically and critically. As a contribution to the 
study of Spanish literature this work is of high impor- 
tance. 

William R. Jenkins Co., of New York Citj , announce 
that they have purchased the old established business 
of F. W. Christern (Dyrsen & Pfeiffer, successors), 
foreign booksellers and importers of the same city. The 
stock has been transferred to the premises of William 
R. Jenkins Co., thereby increasing the supply and variety 
of their books in foreign languages and broadening the 
scope of their business. 

Two interesting additions to Mr. B. W. Huebsch's 
Fall list have just been announced. One of these is Mr. 
John Bigelow's " Temples of Peace Built of Untemp- 
ered Mortar," in which the venerable publicist discusses 
the barrier to universal peace presented by the " pro- 
tective " tariff. The second volume is a study of "Legal 
Doctrine and Social Progress," by Professor Frank 
Parsons, of Boston University. 

A volume on Lincoln and Herndon, by Mr. Joseph 
Fort Newton, author of "The Life of David Swing: 
Poet-Preacher," is announced by the Torch Press. The 
book deals with the personal and political fellowship of 
Abraham Lincoln and his law partner, William H. Hern- 
don. The basis of the study is a series of letters, here 
published for the first time, that passed between Herndon 
and Theodore Parker from 1854 to 1859. 

A new and important publishing organization is an- 
nounced in the formation of the National Arts Publish- 
ing Company, with headquarters in Boston. The presi- 
dent of the company is Mr. Henry Lewis Johnson, 
founder of the magazine, " The Printing Art," the editor- 
ship of which he has just resigned to engage in this 
larger undertaking. A magazine of a unique kind 
which the company will publish is to bear the title, 
" Color." It will be printed with colored illustra- 
tions throughout, including the advertising pages as 
well as the literary section. The subject-matter of 
" Color " will be drawn from the field of the fine and 
industrial arts, the text being profusely illustrated with 
color reproductions made direct from nature. Another 
magazine to be published by the National Arts Publish- 
ing Company is " The School Arts Book," which is 
already established as an educational journal devoted 
to the teaching of art and manual training in schools. 
Mr. Henry Turner Bailey will continue to edit this 
magazine. Another periodical to be issued by the com- 
pany will deal with the latest developments in engrav- 
ing and color printing, under the title of " The Graphic 
Arts Magazine."

In studying circulation remember quality 
is equally important with quantity. Ten 
thousand readers, and every one a tenta- 
tive buyer of your books, is better than 
100,000 scattered circulation where you 
"may hit somebody." Publishers can't 
afford "general publicity."

"With his edition of the Cid, Prof. Bruner sets a new 
standard in the preparation of classical French texts for 
school and college use, in that he makes it his first duty 
to present the work as a piece of literature to be under- 
stood and appreciated by the student as such. ... A

NOTABLE FICTION 



William De Morgan's An Affair of Dishonor 

(By the Auihor of "JOSEPH VANCE." " ALICE -FOR- SHORT." "SOMEHOW GOOD." Etc.) tl.76. 
This romance of the 17th century England shows a new phase of iu author's undoubted genius. 

"An artistic triumph. A novel unlike any other ever written in English. It is leisurely, without any of the defects of slowness, 
discursive without any of the disasters of incoherence, satirical without doing: injustice to humanity, and plausible without re- 
nouncing: the claims of fantasy. Moreover, for all it is a story of fearsome deeds and of fatality, its humor is so abundant and 
pervasive that there is not a shudder in any of its pares." Button Tranter ifi. 

"A better story than any of the others, so far as sustained interest is concerned. . . . I ts style is the rich, suggestive, highly meta- 
phorical style of the De Morgan we have known. 'An Affair of Dishonor ' shines as a romance quite as much as ' Joseph Vance ' does 
among realistic novels. There is not a dull line or vapid sentence. ... Its psychological phases lend it a depth and vitality seldom 
found in a romance. It may easily become the most popular, for it is pure story throughout, rippling along from event to event 
on a dimpling stream of narrative as full of imagery as a forest book is of dancing shadows." Chicago Record- Herald. 

"Of more than sufficient merit to make another reputation, this book will make a new circle of readers for him." Saturday 
Review (London). 

" In a way, especially by those who are not too fond of Mr. De Morgan's former manner, this latest book may be considered 
the triumph of his career." Chicago Evening Pott. 

L. P. Jacks' Mad Shepherds and Other Human Studies 

(By the Editor of "THE HIBBERT JOURNAL.") With frontispiece. $1.20 net. 
"A book that is one in a thousand both for its truth to human nature and literary excellence." Rotton Transcript. 

" It would be delightful to describe and to quote, but it is superfluous. A word to the discriminating is sufficient, and such will 
not fail to acquire the book." Floyd Dell in the Chicago Evening Pott. 

NON-FICTION 

R. W. Doane's Insects and Disease 

A Popular Account of the Way in Which Insects May Spread or Cause Some of Our Common Diseases. With many original 
Illustrations from photographs, and an annotated bibliography. American JVature Seriet. 11.50 net. 

This non-technical work brings together the most important facts, largely from sources at present inaccessible to the general reader 
and even to many physicians and entomologists, in regard to the development, habits, structure, life histories, and methods of 
extermination of the insects that are concerned. 

D. M. Edwards's The Toll of the Arctic Seas 

Illustrated by photographs, drawings, and a map showing routes of all expeditions. 8vo. Probable price. $2.26 net. 
An outline of Arctic Exploration in the form of a rather detailed account, including biographical matter, of the explorers from 
Barents to the present time. There is an unobtrusive amount of scientific and geographical matter ; each account is crammed with 
authentic dramatic and even sensational incidents. The author is a specialist on Arctic exploration and a successful popular writer. 
He has bad access to hitherto unavailable material. 

J. A. Thompson's Darwinism and Human Life 

By the Professor of Natural History in the University of Aberdeen. $1.50 net. 

"The gist of Darwinism. Professor Thompson holds high rank among popular writers on biological subject*. Especially to be 
commended to college teachers who wish to put into the hands of students a brief account of what has been accomplished in the 
study of evolution, which shall be authoritative and at the same time of a sort to stimulate and hold interest. No better book for 
such a purpose is available." The Dial.

Two Remarkable Volumes 



THE DIGRESSIONS OF V 

By ELIHU VEDDER 

THE unique interest of this book lies in its full, candid, and breezy embodiment of the 
author's own ripe experience and engaging temperament. Mr. Vedder is well-known 
to the public both in America and in the art centers of Europe as an artist and as the 
illustrator of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. One of the best talkers of his time, 
Mr. Vedder in his book has tried to express himself so that the delighted reader has a feel- 
ing that he is engaged in an intimate conversation listening to the personal reminiscences 
or humorous whimsies of a man of genius. 

Few books of autobiography have been so frank, none perhaps has ever been so lighted 
by the continuous play of a rich and mellow humor. 

Profusely illustrated. $6.00 net. Postage 26 cents. 

THE CORSICAN The Diary of Napoleon 

'"PHE DIARY OF NAPOLEON here presented absolutely and entirely in his own 
1 words tells the story of his life and career from birth to death with most extraordinary 
vividness and frankness, both as concerns his military campaigns and public affairs and the 
more intimate details of his domestic life, and even his thoughts and moods. 

In its revealing quality it is comparable to the Confessions of St. Augustine and 
Rousseau, the Diary of Pepys, the Autobiography of Franklin. Yet it is perhaps even more 
interesting than these, just as the Diarist is himself a figure of a more worldwide interest.

The Office of a Publisher 




LL good literature uplifts and draws out, the best that is in humanity, 
office of the Publisher should be to further that aim. 



The 



Seventy -two years ago John Cassell came to London with three half- 
pence in his pocket, but with high ideals. 

In 1848 he founded the House of Cassell. Travelling widely through 
England he realized the cruelty of all taxes on knowledge. " You can 
never be low," he said, " unless you make yourself so by ignorance and vice." 

He made up his mind that knowledge should be placed within reach of the people. 
" Let the people read and think ; let them have good and cheap books." 

Fifty-eight years ago John Cassell 's National System of Education became famous. 
When the Great Exhibition of 1851 opened, the Cassell Library of History, Biography, 
and Science was issued at seven pence a volume. That same year he popularized Art 
by publishing " The Magazine of Art," which became famous for notable editors like 
the late W. E. Henley and Mr. M. H. Spielmann. 

As a publisher, John Cassell's chief joy was in his work. His forthright sincerity of 
purpose beat down all obstacles. Endowed with strong common sense, he wasted no 
words on rhetoric ; a saving sense of humor helped him to avoid cranks. That the 
name of Cassell appears on many books which have now become classics is an earnest 
of his literary judgment. 

A broad-minded man withal the world was his country. The friend of Louis 
Kossuth, he was on visiting terms with Lurette and Hachette, the French publishers. 
There was one thing he would not suffer gladly : the morbid and superficial in literature. 
What he demanded of a book was that it should be clean, sound, and honest literature. 

The House of Cassell to-day aims to carry on that tradition. It aspires to purvey 
wholesome literature which shall be informing as well as entertaining. To this House 
the word " literature " has a wide significance. It means not only supplying literary 
entertainment which is meant to amuse in the higher sense, fiction that bears the mark 
of good-humored sanity throughout, but educational works written by those best reputed 
to instruct in a phrase, every activity of the human family calculated to cultivate the 
best that is in them, " the utmost for the highest." The House to-day provides the 
sanest, soundest, and most wholesome of literary fare for all English-speaking readers. 

The sale, within two years, of 1,250,000 volumes of their " People's Library" of 
120 complete classics of fiction and literature, printed from a new and specially designed 
type and published at 25 cents per volume in cloth, and 60 cents in leather, represents a 
recent enterprise in keeping with the best traditions of the House. 

The leading booksellers throughout the United States stock the " Cassell " publica- 
tions. Ask to see them. They comprise recent works by the best authors in the field 
of History, Fiction, Art, and general literature. A catalogue will be sent on request.

There is probably no one in England or America to-day so well qualified as Mr. Maude to be a competent

taken the translation into English of the major portion of Tolstoy's writings, but in addition he has had the 






advantage of knowing the Russian writer intimately for years, and of visiting him frequently. His plan, in 






the present work, has been so far as possible to allow Tolstoy's words to tell their own story. The result 






is a series of literary vignettes, admirable in point of style and particularly so in portraying those events and 






those mental developments which to the great writer himself have seemed of crucial importance.

A Victorious Life 



By LEONORA B. HALSTED 

12mo, Cloth, $1.50 



A story of a woman who has the strength and glow of 
life, life which uses all things as means to its end, growth. 

" A story of a woman's life almost from its beginning to the time when the end is in sight." New York Times. 

" The story is in no sense of the word commonplace, and the interest is well sustained throughout." Philadelphia 

Ledger. 

" A story of an unusual life in rather an unusual manner." Chicago Daily News. 

" It is as unlike the plain tale characteristic of American novelists as the day differs from the night." St. Louis 

Post-Dispatch. 

" The story is of a character that will appeal to the deep and thoughtful reader as well as the lover of light fiction. 

The possibility of the story is convincing from first to last." Grand Rapids News. 

" It is a book so daring it is sure to be talked about." Detroit Free Press. 

" One of the most charming heroines who have been created in years." New Orleans Item. 



The 
Rose Colored World 

and Other Fantasies 

By ETHEL MARY BRODIE 

12mo, Cloth, Net, $1.25 

ILLUSTRATIONS IN COLOR BY 

H. RICHARD BOEHM 
They are the most exquisite and 
finished stories yet published. All 
are brilliant, delightful, fresh, and 
vigorous, and have a charm as clear 
as a running brook. This should 
make the gift book of the year. The 
illustrations alone should make it a 
success, as well as the price. 



The 
Feet of the Years 

By JOHN DALISON HYDE 

12mo, Cloth, Net, $1.25 

The story tells of Penelope, a beauti- 
ful, passionate girl, innocent but 
trustful. The plot is intensely 
dramatic, powerful, and absorbing. 
The story has a freshness and charm 
that will catch the reader's sym-- 
pathy at once, and hold it to the 
end. A delightful, bright, and en- 
gaging novel, and one that will be 
much read and appreciated. 



The 
Romance of a Monk 

By AUX KING 

12mo, Cloth, Net, $1.20 
The story is connected with a 
wealthy and beautiful young woman, 
who, having remained heart-whole 
for many years, is, during a tem- 
porary residence in Rome, brought 
under the influence of a Franciscan 
monk, whose course of Lenten ser- 
mons she attends and whose indif- 
ference to her beauty first piques, 
then goads her to a half petulant, 
half serious resolve to win his admir- 
ation. The denouement is as striking 
as it is original, even without the 
broad interest ; afforded by the in- 
cidental description of Lent and 
Easter in the Eternal City.

The Autobiography of Thomas Collier Platt

If Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, made three English Kings, Thomas Collier Platt made four Presidents of 
the United States and four Governors of New York. How Platt did it is revealed in memoirs, which upon his 
death on March 6th last, he bequeathed to his " Old Guard." He frankly and boldly discloses National and 
State secrets hitherto only dreamed of, except by those in the immediate confidence. 



When Cattle Kingdom Fell 



By J. R. STAFFORD 

With four illustrations. Cloth, 12mo, Net, $1.25 

It is a modern Western story, written with all the emotional intensity and delicate feeling which this dramatic 
land of the West holds for the novel reader of to-day. The story overflows with love, hate, jealousy, revenge, 
and breathes the atmosphere where its people are fearless, reckless, and unconventional. It is a love story of ex- 
ceptional charm, full of moving incidents, with a hero who will surely stand high and have the sympathy of all 
who read this tale ; and the beauty and strong love of the heroine will make her beloved by all.

SIGURD 






A Poem 






By ARTHUR PETERSON 






' 1 A HE story of Sigurd, or Siegfried (of which the best-known 






versions are probably the old Nibelungenlied, and Wagner's 






famous tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen), is one of the most 






celebrated of the world's epics. In the following version Sigurd 






is depicted as a young Norse rover, a wanderer not only by land 






but by sea, this latter innovation seeming to lend itself quite 






naturally to the established legend. 






The action takes place about the middle of the fifth century, 






that eventful period which may be said to mark the end of the 






ancient, and the beginning of the modern world. 






The Hon. RASMUS B. ANDERSON, formerly Professor of 






Scandinavian languages in the University of Wisconsin and 






Ex. U. S. Minister to Denmark, says of this book, in a letter 






to the author : 






" The book is a gem. . . . Your language is simply brilliant 






and your metre perfect. What delightful reading ! How I wish 






you would get millions of readers ; for Sigurd and Brynhild are 






our ancestral hero and heroine, and every American lad and lass 






should know the story by heart. You have surely rendered 






the public a distinct service, that should not fail of eminent 






appreciation."

TWO POETS. 



When Swinburne made his famous pilgrim- 
age to Landor in Florence, he spoke of it as a 
visit from 

" The youngest to the eldest singer 
That England bore." 

When we learned that death had claimed on the 
same day (October IT) both Mrs. Julia Ward 
Howe and Mr. William Vaughn Moody, we 
could not refrain from thinking of them, in 
paraphrase, as 

The youngest and the eldest singer 

Our country bore. ^ 

They were just half a century apart, for the 
one was in her ninety-second year, and the other 
in his forty-second only. The one died after a 
life of the ripest achievement ; the other was 
cruelly cut off, an " inheritor of unfulfilled re- 
nown," not indeed before his genius had been 
amply declared, but before he had accomplished 
more than a small part of what the world ex- 
pected of him. The two lives offer tempting 
contrasts : woman and man, age and youth, East 
and West, past and present, the passion of a 
nation aflame with zeal for the rights of man, 
and the spectacle of the same nation, breathing 
an air grown thick and fat with avarice, brutally 
trampling upon those rights, and glossing its 
degradation with the cant phrases of a pinchbeck 
philanthropy, concealing its greed beneath the 
comfortable cloak of hypocrisy. 

We may not now enlarge upon these contrasts, 
for the present obligation is to set forth in a 
few words the lives and characters of these two 
notable figures in our literature, one of them 
almost the sole remaining figure from the swiftly 
receding old century, the other the most import- 
ant figure in our literature of the young new 
century. Mrs. Howe was born in New York, 
but upon her marriage in 1843 removed to 
Boston, henceforth to be reckoned a New 
Englander in spirit and associations. Her life 
long devotion to philanthropic endeavor of the 
noblest sort, even more than her literary per- 
formance, made her the " grand old woman " of 
America, if we may call her old who was 
the end youthful in feeling, and, despite physic 
infirmity, active in all good works. Married to 
a man who had fought in the Greek war of liber- 
ation and had been Byron's tent-mate, she gave

[Nov. 1, 



her own unstinted sympathies to all peoples 
struggling to be free, in turn to Hungarians 
and Italians and American slaves ; when these 
conflicts had faded into the past, she gave her- 
self with equally unstinted devotion to the less 
spectacular causes of prison reform and woman's 
suffrage and the peace movement. She once 
summed up her career in these modest words : 

I have written one poem which, although composed 
in the stress and strain of civil war, is now sung South 
and North by the champions of free government. I have 
been accounted worthy to listen and to speak at the 
Boston Radical Club and at the Concord School of 
Philosophy. Lastly and chiefly I have had the honor of 
pleading for the slave when he was a slave, of helping 
to initiate the woman's movement in many states of the 
Union, and of standing with the illustrious champions of 
justice and freedom for woman's suffrage when to do so 
was a thankless office, involving public ridicule and 
private avoidance." 

Perhaps there is no more significant single fact 
in her biography than that she was the only 
woman elected to membership in the National 
Institute of Arts and Letters. 

Of Mrs. Howe the poet, it seems to be fated 
that she should be remembered almost solely as 
the author of a single piece. This sort of 
memory, desirable but inadequate, is hers by 
virtue of " The Battle Hymn of the Republic," 
which is undoubtedly one of the noblest lyrics 
of our Civil War. But she wrote other verse 
to the extent of several volumes, and in them 
the judicious may discover treasure-trove worthy 
to be contained in the casket that holds the one 
famous poem. She was also the author of a 
number of dramas and much miscellaneous prose, 
from her contributions to the early volumes of 
"The Atlantic Monthly," to her "Reminis- 
cences," published late in life. She came into 
contact with great numbers of people, both here 
and abroad, through her activity as a preacher 
in Unitarian pulpits and as an occupant of the 
lecture platform. Her last appearance in public 
was only a few days before her death, when 
Smith College honored her with its highest 
degree, bestowed upon her with the following 
words: 

" Julia Ward Howe, poet and patriot, lover of letters 
and learning, advocate for over half a century, in print 
and living speech, of great causes of human liberty, 
sincere friend of all that makes for the elevation and 
enrichment of womanhood ; who having in former yean 
4 read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel,' 
quickened in the nation the imperishable faith in the 
triumph of beneficent right and the ardor of sacrifice 
for its winning; to whom now in her serene, gracious, 
and venerated age we offer felicitation and pay grateful 
homage." 

And when the ceremony was ended, the whole 



assembly rose and sang the "Hymn." and the 
whole affair is pleasant to think about in our 
time of mourning. 

The feeling that a noble life has been fully 
rounded out enables us to accept with something 
like equanimity the loss of such a writer as Mrs. 
Howe. But the loss of such a man as Mr. Moody 
is well-nigh intolerable. He had given us only 
ten years of creative work, and should liave been 
good for twenty or thirty in addition. More- 
over, his work was of such quality that it had 
already made him the foremost figure among our 
younger poets the most remarkable appear- 
ance in the American literature of the twentieth 
century. He alone, or almost alone, spoke in 
our time with the authentic accent of the great 
elder singers, and brought back into poetry the 
high seriousness and lofty utterance of the mas- 
ters. That such a force should cease, that such 
an inspiration should thus untimely fail, is cause 
for the most poignant regret. It is hard to 
become reconciled to an ordering of human 
affairs that frustrates such endeavor as was his, 
and dashes such hopes as were ours in the pres- 
ence of so fair a promise. 

The story of Mr. Moody 's life is briefly told . 
He was born in a small Indiana town in 1869, 
was graduated from Harvard in 1898, was for 
a time an instructor at Cambridge, and was then 
called to the University of Chicago. There he 
did active work until 1907, afterwards retain- 
ing only a nominal connection with the institu- 
tion. Happily married a little more than a 
year ago, he was soon thereafter attacked by the 
insidious malady that was to prove fatal, and 
the closing chapter of his life was a record of 
efforts and wanderings in the vain pursuit of 
health. It was a desperate fight for life, and 
it ended a fortnight ago in Colorado. 

The decade of Mr. Moody's literary produc- 
tiveness has enriched our literature with two 
superb poems in dramatic form, " The Masque 
of Judgment" and "The Fire-Bringer," with 
two prose dramas written for the actual stage, 
"The Great Divide" (at first called "The 
Sabine Woman ") and " The Faith Healer," 
and with a volume of " Poems " that contains 
one of the noblest odes in the English language, 
and a number of lyrics that will henceforth be 
included in every "golden treasury" of Kn^lish 
poetry. To th- journeyman work of literature 
he contributed an essay on Milton, introductory 
to the " Cambridge " edition of the poet, and 
a text-book of English literature (written in 
collaboration with Mr. K. M. Lovett) for the 
use of schools. This is the sum total of Mr. 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

Moody's work, except for a few uncollected 
periodical writings, and whatever manuscripts 
he may have left behind him. 

Of this work, the immortal part will be found 
in the verse rather than the prose. " The Great 
Divide " made an astonishing success upon the 
stage, and is the one production by which the 
author became known to the general public. It 
is a fine play, one of the best produced in our 
time ; but a scale of absolute values must reckon 
it comparatively unimportant by the side of 
" The Masque of Judgment " and " The Fire- 
Bringer." These two poems were planned to 
constitute (together with an unwritten third) 
a trilogy of human destiny, and the deepest of 
our present sorrows is that he could not have 
lived to complete the work. The wonder of 
these poems is that with a mythological or fan- 
tastic framework, and with a beauty of expres- 
sion now wistful and now sublime, challenging 
comparison with the measures of Milton and 
Shelley, suggesting even in their largeness of 
conception the world-poems of " The Divine 
Comedy" and " Faust," they are neither imita- 
tive studies nor antiquarian revivals, but are 
fairly throbbing with the vital issues of the 
modern consciousness. The reader who does 
not feel this to be their essential characteristic 
will peruse them in vain. No American poet, 
old or young, has penned finer lines than those 
of this apostrophe to mankind : 
" O Dreamer! O Desirer! Goer down 

Unto untravelled seas in untried ships ! 

O crusher of the unimagined grape 

On unconceived lips! 

O player upon a lordly instrument 

No man or god hath had in mind to invent; 

O cunning how to shape 

Effulgent Heaven and scoop out bitter Hell 

From the little shine and saltness of a tear; 

Sieger and harrier 

Beyond the moon, of thine own builded town, 

Each morning won, each eve impregnable, 

Each noon evanished sheer! " 

For certain of the poems such as " Glou- 
cester Moors," "A Grey Day," and "At 
Assisi " one must reserve a peculiar tender- 
ness of affection ; but the great feature of the 
volume is that "Ode in Time of Hesitation" 
which scourges as with scorpions the recreant 
America of our wanton Spanish war and our 
Philippine conquest, and our shameless repu- 
diation, by the dark deeds done a decade ago, 
of the sacred principles upon which the Republic 
was founded. In some fairer time to come, 
when we shall have rehabilitated our national 
character by what restitution and atonement 
are yet possible, when 



" The cup of trembling shall be drained quite, 
Eaten the sour bread of astonishment," 

when 

" With ashes of the hearth shall be made white 
Our heads, and wailing shall be in the tent," 

it will be gratifying to turn to this poem, and 
to realize that in our blackest hour genuine 
Americanism found one voice equal to the task 
of expressing all the passionate indignation 
aroused in patriotic breasts by the misstep that 
turned our faces from the shining mountain 
upon which our old ideals were set, and left us 
battening upon a pestilential moor. 



ORIGINALITY IN LITERATURE. 



James Payn, the novelist, told the story of an 
old English scholar who insisted that all modern 
literature was contained in Pindar. " What ! " asked 
Mr. Payn, " you don't mean to say that Browning's 
4 Ring and the Book,' is in Pindar ? " " Yes," said 
the scholar, " in the highest and truest sense ; the 
' Ring and the Book ' is implicit in Pindar." 

Without going as far as this, it may be asserted 
that real originality is a very rare bird. It is not 
a question of the invention or discovery of new 
material. The first part of '"Faust" is a patchwork 
of plagiarisms. Almost everything in it is begged, 
borrowed, or stolen from various sources. Yet it is 
the most original master-work of modern times. 
Nor is originality a question of who wrote the first 
play or novel, or who heralded romanticism or 
realism. There have probably always been plays 
and novels ; the ancients had their romanticists and 
realists. JEschylus was banished from Athens as 
a revolutionary, as irreverent to the gods ; and wise 
heads wagged over Euripides' new notions and his 
break with tradition. Aristophanes and Plautus 
and Petronius plunged as deep into realism as any 
modern. 

Nor is this thing originality a matter of literary 
superiority or inferiority. Many writers are great 
who are not original, and others have a kind of 
originality wha are doubtful in their greatness. 
Milton and Keats and Tennyson are in the first 
class, and Blake and Browning in the second. 
Gray and Arnold and FitzGerald can hardly be 
called original poets at all ; but how great they are ! 

Nor does the advocacy of isms and causes and 
movements, all warranted brand-new by their 
makers, constitute originality. Pretty much all that 
can affect mankind has been threshed out again and 
again. There have been Schillers and Shelleys in 
every age. " I have known twenty leaders of revolt," 
says the old Cardinal in Browning's play. Nor do 
new views of morality, pronouncements of independ- 
ence, make for originality. Moses may break the 
tablets of the law, but they always come together

again, as Milton's angels, divided by sword or 
cannon shot, reunite. 

Not even temperament and personality, and the 
manner of looking at things and the style and way 
of work arising from them, are sure breeders of 
originality, though they come nearest of all to being 
so. Human nature is cast in types, and it is doubt- 
ful if there are as many distinct varieties as there 
are letters of the alphabet. Of course, as there are 
no two leaves in a forest exactly alike, there are 
minor differences in men and women ; and it is to 
these that literature owes its variety and inexhaust- 
ibleness. But they are hardly distinct enough to 
constitute complete originality. Milton reproduced 
^Bschylus and Dante; Goethe repeats Menander 
and Horace and Hafiz. 

The truest originality is perhaps what is called in 
biology a sport a variation by which life develops 
in an unexpected direction. Or it is as if a new 
and powerful element were suddenly introduced into 
the world, making all the other elements change 
their relations, producing strange and spectacular 
reactions. In literature it produces something which 
is not in Pindar, something which, while not greater 
than the stock work of the world, is novel and charm- 
ing, and possesses a power to compel men to follow 
after it Of this kind of originality it seems to me 
there are three great examples in English literature : 
the Shakespearian comedy, Sterne's " Tristram 
Shandy," and Coleridge's best poems, the four 
great pieces on which his fame rests. There are, 
of course, many other lesser exhibitions of this 
quality Burns's and Shelley's poetry, the essays 
of Hazlitt, the Bronte novels, to name a few. None 
of these, however, are as unique and powerful in 
their action as those I have first named. 

In tragedy, in tragic poetry, Shakespeare must 
take his chances with a half-dozen other poets. He 
is certainly not greater here than the author of the 
Book of Job, or Homer, or .ZEschylus, or Dante. 
He does the same kind of work that these do, in 
much the same way, and to the same effect And 
this kind of work is doubtless the most important 
that man has ever done. An attempt has been 
made recently in America to displace these master 
minds of the world whose works include ethics 
as they include all other human interests in favor 
of the professed moralists and ethical writers. This 
is very much as if we should thrust aside the great 
painters the Angelos, the Titian s, the Rembrandt*, 
who have painted us the picture of all life and 
set up in their places the industrious artisans who 
have drawn us our maps. 

Even in Hamlet," where Shakespeare's tragedy 
seems most novel, and in which his influence has 
been so great as almost to shadow the modern 
world, he has been anticipated. Prometheus and 
Orestes are ancient prototypes of that character, and 
perhaps Don Quixote has carried it to a higher power. 

But Shakespeare's comedies are things apart. 
In them a dreamer is either looking forward with 
eager eyes, over-estimating the beauty and splendor 



and goodness of the world, or else he has retired 
in disenchanted disgust into the fortress of his own 
soul which he furnishes with visions to console him 
for the disappointments of outward fate. In either 
case he has produced a new world, an orb within 
the earth. Only in the Nausicaa scenes in Homer, 
or in Kalidasa's Shakuntala, had there been a touch 
of the same creation. " The Tempest," " Midsum- 
mer Night's Dream," " Twelfth Night," " As You 
Like It," "Merchant of Venice," "Much Ado 
about Nothing," "Cymbeline," "The Winter's 
Tale," what is there in all literature to compete 
with this complete and perfect world of ideal beauty 
and magnificence? 

The effect of this magical creation has been over- 
whelming. Poets and novelists in crowds have 
followed the shining Shakespearian track. Scott, 
who decanted Shakespeare into his own bottles, 
Goethe, Hugo in his plays, Musset, Tennyson, 
how much of all that is distinguished and delightful 
in modern literature bears the impress of Shake- 
speare's work. In particular, the latter may almost 
be said to have created woman, or, rather, he 
interposed between the eyes of men and the real, 
faulty, though still interesting creature, the splendid 
or poignant visions of his perfect mates of men. 
And ever since, men have been falling in love with 
his creations or those propagated by his followers 
by cuttings from the plays. Women know very well 
that there is no such being as the Shakespearian 
woman. The girls of Jane Austen are the keenest 
and cleverest satire on their sex. 

Sterne's originality certainly does not exist in 
his materials. The germ idea of his work conies 
from the Martinus Scriblerus of Pope, Swift, and 
Arbuthnot The two central characters have more 
than a reflection of Don Quixote and his Squire. 
Sterne imitated Rabelais and other French humorists. 
Yet when all was done the work was revealed as 
startlingly original. It almost deserves Mark 
Pattison's praise of it as the most perfect piece of 
pure humor in the world. Its effect in English 
literature has been diffusive rather than concen- 
trated. Most later humorists have had a Shandean 
touch ; but few have been full initiates. The author 
of "The Bible in Spain" and our own Godfrey 
Leland are of the number. Carlyle, however, con- 
centrates and reinforces his master. " Sartor 
Resartus," which shook the world two generations 
ago, is Sterne to the backbone. Bulwer trans- 
mogrified Tristram " into a conventional but still 
excellent novel. In Germany, Sterne's influence has 
been deeper. Goethe unquestionably felt it power- 
fully. Jean Paul is a very German Sterne. And 
Heine, both in prose and verse, is Sterne tricked 
out for pantomime and setting off rockets with both 
hands. To the French, Sterne has always been a 
sort of religion, though they have leaned to the 
apocrypha of " The Sentimental Journey " rather 
than to the true canonical books. More recently, 
Flaubert, in his last and perhaps greatest work, and 
M. Anatole France, have disclosed the real Sterne.

THE DIAL 



321 



Coleridge's poetry is the most absolutely original 
thing in English literature. Shakespeare in his 
comedy took his raw materials from Lodge and 
Greene and Lyly, and from the Italian novelists. 
But except some hints from old English ballads, or 
from German works on Demonology and Witch- 
craft, Coleridge's great pieces " The Ancient 
Mariner," " Christabel," " Kubla Khan," and "Gen- 
evieve" are without parentage, celestial estrays, 
as it were, descended in a dream. In conception, 
tone, phrase, music, they are flawless. Language 
obtains in them to a simple perfection beyond the 
reach of conscious art. That they have nothing to 
do with life as it is lived, that they are further 
removed from the world of prose than even Shake- 
speare's comedy, is no fault, rather it makes them 
full examples of what we dimly discern to be ideal 
poetry. 

And the influence of these poems has been com- 
mensurate with their worth. Before "Christabel" 
was published, it was imitated by Scott, Byron, and 
Shelley. A good part of Keats is pure Coleridge. 
" La Belle Dame Sans Merci " is almost as good as 
" Genevieve," but it is palpably an imitation. The 
fragment of " The Eve of St. Mark " is a milder 
" Christabel." " The Eve of St. Agnes " is drenched 
with Coleridge's glamor and color. Keats is indeed 
the unrivalled mocking-bird of literature. He could 
take anyone's note Shakespeare's, Milton's, Dry- 
den's, Collins's, Chatterton's and return it back 
with the truest ring, yet embellished with variations 
which make the strain his own. 

More recently, Tennyson, Poe, Rossetti,and many 
others, have continued the Coleridgean tradition. 
As a long-time champion of Poe, I will not be sus- 
pected of depreciating his originality. In comparison 
with other American writers, or even his English 
contemporaries, he is an explorer and a discoverer. 
But his relations to Coleridge are those of a pupil to 
a master. He is more vigorous and versatile. He 
left fifty masterpieces where Coleridge left but four. 
He is more profound in his appeal to human passions 
and emotions more vEschylean in his handling. 
But the fact remains that his work is inconceivable 
without the previous existence of that of Coleridge, 
and he never quite matched his teacher in loveliness, 
magic, or thrilling awe. 

It is obvious, I think, that originality is not a 
prime literary requisite. Everything is in Pindar 
which is really necessary for us, love of the gods, 
of country and of home, heroism, disdain of death 
or meanness, activity of mind and body. The great 
and permanent works of mankind are too true to 
be very new. Everything over is in the nature of 
a luxury : something outside of our staple diet. 
We do not boast of having soup and roast beef and 
bread for dinner, though there is nothing better; 
if we get terrapin and ptarmigan and rare Madeira 
we may be betrayed into enthusiasm. 

The writer who has this gift of originality is 
more followed than any other. He bears a branch 
of holly in his hands which draws the crowd 



after him, which presses near him to discern his 
secret. It is really not truth that he deals in, but 
enchantment. 

" Weave a circle round him thrice, 
And close your eyes with holy dread, 
For he on honey-dew hath fed, 
And drunk the milk of Paradise." 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE DISPERSAL OF A GREAT LIBRARY will OCCUr 

in February next, when the collection of the late 
Robert Hoe will be sold by the Anderson Auction 
Company in New York City. The Hoe library is 
said to be not only the largest private library in 
existence, but probably the largest and most valu- 
able ever collected by a private citizen. Its estimated 
value is $1,500,000. Robert Hoe was born in New 
York in 1839, and lived to the age of seventy, dying 
last year in London after a long and successful 
business career as a printing-press manufacturer and 
inventor. When only nineteen years of age he be- 
came interested in the history and development of 
printing, and at that early age began to buy books 
on the subject, constantly improving his library by 
substituting better copies than those already in his 
possession. Shortly before his death Mr. Hoe issued 
the final volume of his Library Catalogue. This is 
now complete in fifteen octavo volumes, and de- 
scribes 6,993 titles of English literature; 6.574 
titles of books printed in foreign languages, includ- 
ing his marvellous collection of Incunabula, crowned 
by a copy of that great treasure, the first book 
printed with movable types, the Bible on vellum, 
issued from Gutenberg's press at Moguntia be- 
tween 1450 and 1455; also a list of Books of 
Emblems of 463 titles. The collection includes the 
finest copy in existence of Higden's "Polychronicon," 
printed by Caxton in 1482, a perfect copy of 
Malory's "Morte d' Arthur" in the Caxton edition of 
1485, and Gower's "Confessio Amantis " of 1483. 
There are also many examples of the earliest presses 
of Germany, Italy, France, and England, Books of 
Hours, Aldines and Elzevirs, thousands of volumes 
devoted to the literature of France, many examples 
of early English literature, particularly of the Eliza- 
bethan period, including Shakespeare folios, the 
splendid Chaucer Collection, the Kilmarnock Burns 
with an inserted letter, Queen Elizabeth's own copy 
of the Prayer Book, such rare Americana as all 
three Latin editions of Columbus's first letter, all 
printed in 1493, Denton's New York (1670) in 
perfect condition uncut, Eden's " Decades," and a 
little pamphlet of four leaves from the press of 
Stephen Daye " in Cambridge in New England " of 
the "Proceedings betwixt the English and the 
Narrow gansets " (1645). At the time of his death 
Mr. Hoe was preparing a catalogue of his illumin- 
ated and other manuscripts on vellum and paper, of 
which he has over 130 single titles, the most im- 



[Nov. 1, 



portant of which is doubtless an English manuscript 
of the fifteenth century called "The Pembroke 
Hours," written for William Herbert, first Earl of 
Pembroke, about 1440. 



THE ADVENT OF THE COLLEGE-BRED JOURNALIST 

was hailed with scoffs and jeers in certain quarters, 
and with applause in others. Professor Frank W. 
Scott, in charge of the courses leading to journalism 
at the University of Illinois, has some interesting 
things to say about "College Training for Jour- 
nalism" in a late number of "The Independent" 
"Twenty-five or thirty years ago," he writes, "a 
college training was a handicap to the young man 
applying for a job as reporter. A Yale graduate, 
now the oldest reporter on a great Chicago daily, 
secured his present job, he asserts, only by conceal- 
ing the blot on his educational 'scutcheon. He was 
the only college man in the reporters' room then ; 
now there are but two in the room who are not col- 
lege men, and neither of those is the city editor." 
Encouraging has been the recent growth of " intel- 
ligent public interest in the press as an institution. 
Journalism has long been a profession that everyone 
out of it could improve if he were in it . and every- 
one in it could improve if he did not have to stay in 
it ." It has been not inaptly said that the chief use 
of a college education in general is to prove to the 
college man how short a distance his academic 
training will carry him in the great outside world. 
Probably even the best of schools of journalism turn 
out graduates who will learn, with the sadness that 
often accompanies an access of wisdom, that they 
do not yet " know it all," or even the quarter part 
of it. ... 

THE PARTNERSHIP NOVEL, or work of fiction exe- 
cuted by two collaborating writers, such as Mr. and 
Mrs. Egerton Castle and Mr. and Mrs. C. N. 
Williamson are now abundantly producing, and 
such as Messrs. Besant and Rice and Messrs. Erck- 
mann and Chatrian used to favor us with, must 
always seem to some readers less satisfying, less 
"convincing," than the work of literary art con- 
ceived by one mind in a moment of inspiration, and 
finished by one hand ere the flush of that first 
enthusiasm has faded from the cheek. The appear- 
ance of two authors' names on a novel's title-page 
is a virtual confession that the plot has been labor- 
iously pieced together by two workmen in consul- 
tation, that each chapter has been deliberately as- 
signed to this or that one of the literary firm, that 
the fate of each character has been wordily dis- 
cussed and finally determined, and that after the 
patchwork has at last been completed a finishing 
hand has had to go over it all to pull out the bast- 
ing threads and fell the seams. Such work must 
lack unity and homogeneity. What lover of Steven- 
son has ever thoroughly enjoyed the stories he wrote 
in collaboration with his stepson ? A recent literary 
letter from London suggests that an interesting book 
might be written about literary partnerships. An 
instructive inquiry might indeed be made into the 



comparative success of one-author and two-author 
novels. Is there a single first-rate novel of double 
authorship? ... 

THE SEASON'S PROSPECTS IN THE BOOK BUSINESS 
interest others beside booksellers. Promise of a 
brisk demand for good reading is always a gratify- 
ing indication that the cause of civilization is not a 
losing one ; and it is pleasant to learn from London, 
the great centre of trade for books printed in our 
language, as well as for some other commodities, 
that there is every likelihood of a record-breaking 
season in the production and dispensing of literature. 
At any rate, publishers' autumn announcements were 
never superior in quantity, while as to quality they 
certainly inspire hope of many good things to be 
forthcoming. So much in the way of supply implies 
confidence in the demand. " A market for products 
is products in market," as that famous political 
economist and free-trader, Professor Perry of 
Williams College, used to teach his classes. That 
purchasers will not be lacking when the goods are 
displayed, is to be hoped, and, for certain reasons, to 
be predicted. Our material prosperity leaves not 
a very great deal to be desired at least among 
the book-reading classes ; and after the inevitable 
Christmas purchases of jewelry and motor-cars and 
similar toys and knickknacks have been made, there 
ought to be a handsome surplus left for the things 
of the intellectual life including, first and fore- 
most, books and plenty of them.

SPECIALIZING IN LIBRARIES is very sure to in- 
crease with the increasing spread of printed matter 
over all departments of human interest and activity. 
The professions and the trades have each its con- 
siderable and ever-growing volume of technical lit- 
erature, and the time will come, if it be not already 
here, when few libraries for the general public can 
undertake to meet the demand for books and peri- 
odicals of this special character. This matter, in 
some of its bearings at least, will come under dis- 
cussion at the meeting of the Special Libraries 
Association to be held in the Boston Chamber of 
Commerce on the llth of November. Other sub- 
jects announced for treatment by various speakers 
are, " The Chamber of Commerce Library and the 
Facilities it Affords," " The Statistical Department 
of the Boston Public Library and What it Offers 
the Business Man," "The Earning Power of 
Libraries," and the question of Boston's need of a 
business and professional men's branch to its public 
library. Various special and business libraries in 
Boston will be visited by the attending members 
between the afternoon and the evening sessions.

tials, presumably intending never to meet again. 
Miss Eugenie Sauer, of Vienna, found herself heiress 
to a fortune left her by an old uncle in her native 
land, but with a strange proviso attached to the 
legacy. Only by becoming a wife within forty-eight 
hours of receiving word of her inheritance could she 
hope to become its actual possessor. Being without 
any particular matrimonial intentions, the thrifty 
heiress advertised for a temporary husband, offering 
two hundred dollars for his services at the altar in 
the capacity of a bridegroom, and stipulating that 
he should desert her immediately after the wedding. 
A man (if such he be worthy of being called) was 
selected from the large number of those who an- 
swered the advertisement, and as soon as the mock 
marriage was performed he abandoned the woman 
whom he had just promised to love and cherish until 
death should part the two. But as he had previously 
promised to break this latter promise, possibly a 
casuist could make out something of a case in his 
defense, and also in hers. At any rate, here is ma- 
terial for a new romance under the old title, " Maid, 
Wife, or Widow?" . . . 

THE GROWING MARKET FOR READING-MATTER 

one need not call it all literature ought to be encour- 
aging to the large class of those who earn their liv- 
ing by plying the pen or pounding the type-writer. 
Note the new and cheap illustrated magazines con- 
tinually springing into being; and although many 
of them soon subside again into non-being, the total 
result is an astonishing increase in the number of 
periodicals clamoring, not so very unsuccessfully, 
for popular patronage. The modern news-stand, 
with its polychromatic display of interest-compelling 
magazines, is a very different thing from the news- 
stand of fifty or even twenty-five years ago. And 
material, more or less literary, has to be found to 
fill all these competing publications, which have 
learned to rely with considerable confidence on the 
pecuniary support of the advertiser to keep them- 
selves afloat. By a beautiful interplay of differing 
interests, the safety-razor and the cigarette help to 
circulate the poem and the love-story ; and while 
commerce thus generously subsidizes dubious liter- 
ature, an additional subsidy is granted by the gov- 
ernment in the cheap rates of postage for all period- 
icals, circulating between Maine and California, 
between Canada and Mexico, and even to the dis- 
tant islands of the East. It is no wonder that 
foreigners envy us our vast literary market.

THE " JOURNALIZED SHORT STORY " AGAIN. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Perhaps "journalized " is as convenient a label as any 
for ticketing the brand of short fiction which fills the 
pages of American periodicals and evidently harrows 
the soul of your correspondent in your issue of October 1. 
My own soul, it seems, or at least that portion of it 
which is concerned with its inheritance of letters, is 
made of less friable stuff; for not a scratch mars its 
cheerful surface, despite the fact that I agree with him 
in regarding the bulk of the short stories published to- 
day as wholly undistinguished. 

Undistinguished : is n't that a word which goes to the 
root of the matter? For, after all, the trouble is con- 
stitutional rather than local. A story, long or short, 
may be as sensational as you please, may fairly drip 
with smeared-on color, or be a hurly-burly of incident, 
to the exclusion of characterization and atmosphere, and 
still hold a kernel of literary (which in the end means 
only lasting) worth. Dumas, Dickens, Kipling, Field- 
ing, Charles Reade, Wilkie Collins, there's a plentiful 
array of men whose personal attractiveness makes their 
faults seem of small account. But when a story has no 
personality at all, is simply one more yard cut off the bolt 
and hemmed (a fair description of our current fiction), 
its fate is sealed, whether or no it violate the canons. 

But why get excited over that ? The mass of all the 
stuff that blackened good white paper since What-ever- 
his-name-was stumbled on the seductive art of printing, 
has been equally undistinguished. Shall we therefore 
devote ourselves to lamenting the artistic sterility of 
our times ? What a set of lamentful Jeremiahs that 
would make of us ! 

And why blame the good newspaper men who have 
gone to making magazines ? To be sure, they also make 
a wider market than ever was before for the stuff we are 
talking of. But what is the connection between them 
and the dearth of literature ? Literature has never been 
dependent on magazines to get itself printed. It always 
manages to stagger through to the light somehow, and 
soon or late people learn of it. So, if a man comes in 
our day with something really worth while to say and 
the everlasting knack of saying it, he '11 manage to get 
it out without help or hindrance of all the editors 
between here and the ultimate bourne of editors. That 
will be literature. 

And while we are waiting for him if we have 
nothing else to do surely we may amuse ourselves 
with reading rattling good yarns ; and no one, so far as 
I can see, will be the worse for it, while publisher and 
writer will be the better off by our dimes. 

That, dear Mr. Editor, is my feeling about the 
condition of which your correspondent speaks. I wish 
I had leisure and you had patience for a little closer 
analysis of his position. For he seems to me to 
exhibit both the excellences and the defects of the 
academic spirit, an admirable keeper of what is already 
proved to be good, but a somewhat stolid listener to 
unidentified applicants for approval, tending to judge 
them by very rigid standards. Witness the hushed 
tones in which he speaks of certain stuff as "literary "; 
the placid assurance with which he sets down the writ- 
ing of short narrative as " an art which should be deli- 
cate and graceful, though strong" (how Meredith would 
have snapped a phrase and a notion like that at the end

MAKING HISTORY INTERESTING. 
(To the Editor of TUB DIAL.) 

To the pleading of Dr. Crothers and Professor Trent 
that " History should be interesting," Professor Charles 
Woodward Hutson adds, in THE DIAL for October 1, 
the advice that modern students of history should go 
back for their model to Macaulay, whose vastness of 
knowledge was happily combined with a wonderful 
style and with the ability to give us " a sense of con- 
tinuity that assures us of our being a part of the Divine 
Plan." Incidentally, Professor Hutson takes a shot at 
our modern doctors' theses, and the misguided unfortu- 
nates who perpetrate them. 

In the minds of those who present this point of view 
there seems to us to lie a serious misapprehension. The 
men of letters seem to have a lurking suspicion that the 
historical workers have formed a Union for the Promo- 
tion of Uninteresting English. This is really not the 
case: we do not know of a single uninteresting writer 
of history who would not like to write as Macaulay 
wrote, if he could. But, unfortunately, this is not a 
matter of will, but a matter of genius; and if the younger 
generation of American students of history were to try 
literally to copy Macaulay's style, the result would be 
the same as that which Professor Hutson tells of in the 
case of imitators who immediately succeeded the mas- 
ter, who "made that facile, forcible, uncompromising 
style a disgust to many." 

Leaving out the question of personal endowments, 
however, we agree with Professor Hutson that much 
historical work is expressed in unnecessarily bad English. 
But does this indictment lie against writers of history 
only ? or is the criticism to be applied to all forms of 
what may be called learned writing? In this matter of 
style, are doctors' theses in English much superior to 
those in history? We have heard of one, at least, 
accepted by a leading university, which is nothing more 
or less than a catalogue of books; a compilation which 
does not give much opportunity for the divine style of 
Macaulay. So perhaps it is the doctoral dissertation, 
and not history, that is at fanlt. If this is so, is it a 
necessary evil? 

The fact that some theses are much better written 
than others, and that the dissertations of the French, 
for example, show a commendable degree of form with- 
out deficiencies in scholarship, would seem to afford 
room for the hope that, with better school and college 
instruction in English, the careless and inaccurate writing 
of the average graduate student may improve. But we 
doubt whether even a great improvement in this respect 
would meet the criticisms of Professor Hutson and those 
who share his views. They have a grievance against 
the modern-trained student of history which goes deeper 
than mere split infinitives or incorrect paragraphing. 
The fundamental difference in view-point may, we 
think, be expressed somewhat as follows: 

Our critics insist upon regarding the doctor's disser- 
tation as something which, intending to be literature, 
fails through negligence and lack of literary ideals. 
The historical students, however, would reply to the 



effect that the doctor's dissertation makes no claim to 
be literature. It is not written for public consumption. 
It is printed and published (or ought to be) that its eon- 
tents may not escape the criticism, not of men-of-letters, 
but of experts in the field which the thesis covers. 
Except for the needs of these specialists, the whole 
importance of the thesis lies not in its interest to those 
who read it, but in what has gone before, in the produc- 
tion of it. It should stand as witness of the fact that, 
for at least once in his life, the student has left the 
beaten track and worked in the fields with the raw >tutV. 
He is very fortunate indeed if he succeeds in making 
some important contribution to knowledge ; but success 
in this respect is not the raison d'etre of his work. It is 
not the result, but the methods, not the gift to the world, 
but the discipline of the man, which is the end in view. 

Having given utterance to this literary heterodoxy, 
we are glad to revise the statement somewhat. It is 
neither desirable nor necessary that a man should spend 
his life in writing dissertations; the production of theses 
is not all the work of historical students. The scientific 
method once established (our apologies to Professor 
Hutson for the use of the term !) the writer of History 
should not forget the art of literature. The implication 
of Professor Hutson and others is not, we think, quite 
fair. Macaulays, like other great artists, are not horn 
every day. But here in the United States at the pre- 
sent time the feeling that attention to form is necessary 
to good work is on the increase; and not only in the 
larger histories like those of Channing or Rhodes, but 
in single volumes like some in the " American Nation " 
series, there is much historical writing that is as good 
literature as any other American prose. If this is so, 
surely it will be better to let our history writing pursue 
its own native development, without a forced return to 
the methods of that master of literature to whose his- 
torical work, magnificent as it is, the beginner must be 
directed with words of warning. It is true, as Professor 
Hutson remarks, that no man can escape the influence 
of his own bias or attain absolute impartiality. But he 
can wish to do so, and learn how to approximate to this 
end. To accomplish this is the effort of the scientific " 
student of history. He strives 'to make his work inter- 
esting if possible, but at all events to tell the truth.

THE RETURN TO MACAULAY. 
(To the Editor of THK DIAL.) 

By all means let us have a return to the spirit and 
methods of Macaulay," provided that the aspiring his- 
torian has also the equipment and genius of Macaulay. 
But that the earnest, truth-seeking historian of to-day 
should withhold his pen until so skilled in " variety of 
statement," "art in emphasis," "illuminating alluM\r- 
ness," etc., as to make his history "more entertaining 
than most novels," would be to defer indefinitely the 
exposition of much important historic truth. And, indeed, 
modern historical writing is not all deadly; much of it 
is both readable and scholarly. Present-day investiga- 
tors doubtless envy the fluency and eloquence of the 
great poet and essayist; yet truth and accuracy must 
comejir.it with real lovers of history. Absolute impar- 
tiality may not be possible, since no historian can wholly 
escape his environment; but it can be honestly aimed at 
and coMcitnu partisanxhip avoided.

ILLUSTRIOUS FAXATIC.* 



It is a rare gift to be able duly to appreciate 
the fanatic. The sober thinker can never adopt 
his methods in practice or approve them in 
theory, however noble and useful the end in 
view may have been. Absorbed in his ruling 
purpose, the fanatic either has never developed 
the power of logical reasoning or has thrust it 
aside as an encumbrance upon his freedom of 
action. His moral and intellectual compass thus 
out of sight, it is not strange that in his efforts 
to get at his goal at any cost he is occasionally 
found in paths which, to the observer who does 
not thoroughly understand him, seem to classify 
him with the fool or the knave. Either as one 
or both, John Brown, the anti-slavery fanatic, 
was honestly regarded by hundreds of thousands 
of his fellow-citizens, when the Harper's Ferry 
catastrophe brought his career so vividly into 
the consciousness of the American people in the 
autumn of 1859. And at the expiration of 
fifty years one will not go far to find critics who 
still refuse to assign to John Brown any posi- 
tion of utility or honor in the great work of 
redeeming America from the crime of human 
slavery. In 1859,opinion was so generally adverse 
that James Russell Lowell, as editor of " The 
Atlantic," felt obliged to write to Colonel 
Higginson, " Editorially I am a little afraid of 
Brown, and Tickner would be more so." The 
Civil War, of course, turned many to the side 
of Brown from motives of passionate partisan- 
ship for anything aimed against the tyranny of 
slavery, and led some to a really sympathetic 
comprehension of his true position. We take 
the following paragraph from an address of 
George William Curtis, delivered more than fifty 
times, and to large and sympathetic audiences, 
during 1864 and 1865 : 

" The two most illustrious fanatics in our history 
were John C. Calhoun and old John Brown. They re- 
presented the inevitable tendencies of American civili- 
zation. One died in his bed, honored and deplored as 
a great statesman. The other was hung upon a gallows, 
derided as a fanatic. The statesman struggles with his 
last strength to keep millions of human beings degraded. 
The felon stoops beneath the gallows, and, tenderly 
lifting a child of the degraded race, kisses her in the 
soft winter sun. Peace ! Peace ! History and the 
human heart will judge between them. Both their 
bodies lie mouldering in the grave; whose soul is 
marching on ? It was the fanaticism of abolitionism

that has saved this country from the fanaticism of 
slavery. It was fire fighting fire. And the fire of 
heaven is prevailing over that of hell." (Orations and 
Addresses, Vol. I., p. 146.) 

Some, however, were carried so far by the 
sympathetic swing of the pendulum as to make 
it impossible for them to admit the truth of 
certain facts in Brown's anti-slavery career 
which are absolutely necessary to any final 
estimate of his character and work. And as 
public opinion in the North has been largely 
colored by some of these very men, there was 
a real need for such a re-hearing of the entire 
case as this thoroughgoing biography by Mr. 
Villard has made available to every reading 
man. To come at once to the important char- 
acteristic of the author's work, he presents and 
accepts satisfactory evidence that Brown was 
directly and knowingly responsible for the 
notorious murders on Pottawatomie Creek, in 
Kansas, on the night of May 24-25, 1856 ; 
that he intentionally made statements of such a 
nature as to lead his friends to disbelieve and 
deny that responsibility, thus misleading public 
opinion ; that he sanctioned and aided in the 
carrying off of horses and other private property 
belonging to pro-slavery men, in Kansas and 
Missouri, under such circumstances and in such 
a manner that his action must be branded as 
indefensible under any consistent code of moral 
principles ; that in private business relations he 
was occasionally lacking in that frankness and 
straightforwardness usually considered essential 
to any high standard of honor ; and that he 
showed a surprising lack of ordinary judgment 
as to the relation of means to end in many of 
his enterprises, and preeminently so in the 
Harper's Ferry affair, which brought his earthly 
career to such a tragic termination. And yet, 
with all these forbidding facts duly accepted 
and estimated at their full weight, Mr. Villard 
sees and convinces the reader that the real John 
Brown was neither knave nor fool, but one of 
the great moral forces of human history, always 
consciously striving for a great moral end, even 
in those misguided actions that tended to deprive 
the anti-slavery cause of moral advantage which 
it might otherwise have possessed. To have 
brought out the real greatness of Brown, with 
no attempt at evasion or denial of such facts in 
his life as sound moral judgment must inevitably 
condemn, is an achievement for the successful 
accomplishment of which the author deserves 
the highest credit. Great moral harm has been 
done, and is being done to-day, by the too easy 
assumption that deeds which nobody would

[Nov. 1, 



excuse in an ordinary man are allowable when 
done by one who can impress himself upon the 
imagination as acting under some great moral 
impulse. The value of such a book as Mr. 
Villard has written is that it brings the reader 
down to a realization of the inconsistencies and 
contradictions which may mar the work even of 
the most single-minded laborer for the righting 
of any great wrong, and impresses upon him the 
crying need that trained intelligence and moral 
fervor shall go hand in hand in the amelioration 
of untoward conditions of human existence. 

We must commend also the unflagging zeal 
in the search for materials which has character- 
ized the preparation of this biography. Not 
only have all available written sources been 
studied, but the country has been traversed from 
Atlantic to Pacific, either by the author himself 
or by others working under his direction and 
at his expense, in order to secure personal inter- 
views with Brown's still living relatives and 
associates and get whatever light they might be 
able to throw upon his character and career. 
How important it was that this should be done 
without further delay, is evident from the fact 
that the present writer has incidentally noticed 
newspaper accounts of the death of several of 
these witnesses within the short interval since 
Mr. Villard's book went to the press. The 
desire and need for a copious presentation of 
facts, especially upon such controverted points 
as the murders on the Pottawatomie, stood 
somewhat in the way of the most attractive 
literary presentation ; and yet no serious defect 
on that score can be alleged against the volume. 
Mr. Villard's English is always clear and effec- 
tive, eloquent when the subject-matter is of a 
nature to inspire and justify eloquence, as in 
various parts of the last three chapters, in which 
the noble dignity of Brown after his capture, 
and the solemn scene of his execution, are finely 
portrayed. If Brown's specific purposes had 
been hindered or brought to naught all along 
the way by the want of insight, the gift of clear 
vision was surely bestowed upon him in double 
measure at the end. As the blow of a hatchet 
in the sheriff's hand left his body dangling in 
the air, the stillness was broken by the voice of 
Colonel Preston, solemnly declaring, " So perish 
all such enemies of Virginia ! All such enemies 
of the Union! All such foes of the human 
race!" As Mr. Villard tells us : 

" It was said, without a shade of animosity, without 
a note of exultation ; but the blind man was not he who 
swung from the rope above. For his eyes had seen, 
long before his light had failed, the coming of the blue- 
clad masses of the North who were to make a mockery 



of Colonel Preston's words and strike down the destroy- 
ing tyranny of slavery, to free Virginia from the most 
hateful of self-imposed bonds. As the troops now 
solemnly tramped away, with all decorum and without 
any demonstrations, in far-off Albany they were firing 
one hundred guns as the dirge of the martyr. And 
meanwhile, John Brown's soul was marching on, and 
all in the North who had a conscience and a heart knew 
that John A. Andrew voiced the truth when he de- 
clared, Whether the enterprise of John Brown and his 
associates in Virginia was wise or foolish, right or wrong; 
I only know that, whether the enterprise itself was the 
one or the other, John Brown himself is right.' " 

On the day after the execution, George Hoadley 
wrote to Salmon P. Chase: "Poor old John 
Brown, God sanctify his death to our good, 
and give us a little of his courage, piety, 
and self-sacrificing spirit, with more brains." 
It was Brown's foresight of the tremendous 
impression his death was to make upon the 
heretofore slumbering consciences of countless 
thousands of his fellow-men that closed his ear 
irrevocably to the many suggestions of rescue 
which earnest friends found the means to con- 
vey to him. With the sword of violence now 
broken and useless at his feet, the truth dawned 
upon his mind too clearly to allow him to fling 
away by cowardly escape the one weapon now 
left to him the sword of the spirit. 

" Not often in history is there recorded such a rise to 
spiritual greatness of one whose hands were so stained 
with blood, whose judgment was ever so faulty, whose 
public career was so brief. . . . And so, wherever there 
is battling against injustice and oppression, the Charles- 
town gallows that became a cross will help men to live 
and die. The story of John Brown will ever confront the 
spirit of despotism, when men are struggling to throw 
off the shackles of social or political or physical slavery." 

We are all acquainted with that type of biog- 
raphy which hides every defect of a great man 
and unfolds to the eye of the reader a record so 
flawless that its very perfection stamps it as 
humanly impossible. And of late years we 
know, too, the pseudo-biographer, too little in 
spirit and intellect to understand greatness when 
he sees it, who magnifies the petty flaws of a 
great life until all its glory and usefulness are 
lost to view in the malarial fog of misrepresenta- 
tion thus stirred up. And fortunately for human 
progress based upon the study of human life as 
it is, we have now and then a biographer who 
can bring out the real greatness of a life in the 
only true way, by picturing to us faithfully aff 
the difficulties with which that life had to con- 
tend, within as well as without. Such a service 
John T. Morse did for us in his life of Lincoln ; 
and such a service Mr. Villard has now rendered 
a decidedly more difficult task in this life 



of John Brown.

perceptions," as Mrs. Mona Caird once said of 
him, William Sharp lived a life abounding in 
wealth of vivid experience, intensity of varied 
sensation, splendor of glorious visions, unfailing 
cheer of high hopes, and actual achievement of 
things eminently worth while. Sufferings 
enough, it is true, fell to his lot ; but neverthe- 
less, or perhaps for that very reason, he cher- 
ished throughout "a great sense of sunshine 
and boyish freshness," an unfading joy in all 
good things, a spirit ever ready for any adven- 
ture, and a keen delight in the poetry and 
romance of this our earthly pilgrimage, at the 
end of which he, for his part, was ready to cry : 
" Farewell to the known and exhausted, 
Welcome the unknown and illimitable ! " 

Five years have passed since the death of him 
who for a decade and more had puzzled a large 
part of the literary world with his assumption 
of the pseudonym " Fiona Macleod," and his 
perpetration of an innocent Ossianic hoax by 
which our literature became the gainer ; and 
now his widow, herself a poet and the collabor- 
ator with her husband in their " Lyra Celtica," 
has prepared a biography with the simple title 
"William Sharp (Fiona Macleod): A Me- 
moir." The added words, " Compiled by his 
wife," indicate the large use she has made of 
his letters and diaries, as also of letters written 
to him. The gifted man, dual if not multiple 
in his personality, is made to tell his own life- 
story, as far as possible, from its beginning on 
the 12th of September 1855, at Paisley, to its 
premature close on a wild December afternoon 
of 1905, in the mountains of Sicily. 

It is the penalty of genius that it must, with 
much striving and stumbling, find itself before 
it can enjoy any measure of calm content. The 
vicissitudes of William Sharp's restless youth 
are very much what might have been expected 
in his case. The regular walks of life, the emi- 
nently respectable and honorable pursuits and 
callings of those around him, were none of them 
for him. Uncertain health and misunderstood 
aptitudes were the cause of many futilities and 
failures in his efforts to strike into the road 
along which he was finally destined to journey. 
For some not too intelligible reason, he did not 
even equip himself with a good education in 
the fundamentals before beginning his battle

with the world. For two years he studied at 
Glasgow University, and of course was especially 
drawn to English literature, then taught by 
Professor John Nichol, whose valued friendship 
Sharp long afterward retained; but in 1874 he 
was placed by his father, with a view to ascer- 
taining where the young man's capabilities lay, 
in the law office of Messrs. Maclure and Han- 
ney, of Glasgow, where he gave to his profes- 
sional studies only a languid attention as com- 
pared with his interest in those private literary 
pursuits that he allowed to rob him of all but 
four hours of what should have been his sleeping 
time. Naturally he broke down under the 
strain, and was sent to Australia to recuperate. 
It was not long, however, before he was back 
in London, intent on making a way for himself 
into the charmed world of letters, and greatly 
encouraged in his undertaking by the generous 
kindness and hearty appreciation of Rossetti. 
Before that friendly hand was extended to him 
he had been well-nigh driven to despair by a 
cruelly candid letter from Robert Buchanan, 
some of whose literary work had been en- 
thusiastically admired by young Sharp so 
sympathetically enjoyed, in fact, that he had 
felt prompted to send a few of his own poems 
to its author, asking for criticism and hoping 
for praise. Perhaps it was inevitable, at any 
rate it was characteristic of Buchanan, that he 
should send back a harshly discouraging word 
to the young poet, whom he strongly urged 
not to dream of literature as a career. From 
the long and deep depression caused by that 
untactful letter, only the reiterated expressions 
of confidence and hope from her who afterward 
became his wife succeeded in arousing him. 

As it is the literary likings and dislikings 
of an author that throw the strongest light on 
his own genius, and indicate the character of 
his work, let us quote from Sharp's unstudied 
words of praise lavished upon the poet Dante 
Gabriel Rossetti in a letter to a friend. 

" I had a splendid evening last night, and Rossetti 
read a lot more of his latest work. Splendid as his 
published work is, it is surpassed by what has yet to 
be published. The more I look into and hear his poems 
the more I am struck with the incomparable power and 
depth of his genius his almost magical perfection and 
mastery of language his magnificent spiritual strength 
and subtlety. He read some things last night, lines in 
which almost took my breath away. No sonnet-writer 
in the past has equalled him, and it is almost inconceiv- 
able to imagine any one doing so in the future. His 
influence is already deep and strong, but I believe in 
time to come he will be looked back to as we now look 
to Shakespeare, to Milton, and in one sense to Keats. 
I can find no language to express my admiration of his

supreme gifts, and it is with an almost painful ecstasy 
that I receive from time to time fresh revelations of 
his intellectual, spiritual, and artistic splendour." 

This was written nearly thirty years ago, ere 
the fine flush of youth had begun to fade from 
the writer's check ; and it reminds one of Mr. 
Hall Caine's expressions of passionate admira- 
tion for Rossetti, who to him also had played 
the part of cordial friend and helpful adviser. 

Concerning Sharp's adoption of the pseu- 
donym "Fiona Macleod," and the writings 
signed therewith, an interesting chapter occurs 
at the opening of Part II. of this memoir. It 
was in 1898, while Mr. and Mrs. Sharp were 
in Rome for the spring months, that he found 
the desired incentive toward a true expression 
of himself, in the stimulus and sympathetic 
understanding of the friend to whom he dedi- 
cated the first of the books published under his 
JIM in loin \ in." To this unnamed friend, whom 
he first met at that time, Sharp declared 
he owed his development as " Fiona Macleod," 
although in a sense, as he himself adds, that 
had begun long before he knew her, and indeed 
while he was still a child. But " without her 
there would have been no ' Fiona Macleod.' " 

In a friendly letter to the mysterious Fiona, 
Grant Allen gave expression to some criticism 
that may voice sentiments of others beside the 
writer. He says of " Pharais," which had been 
sent to him by the author : 

" It is instinct with the dreamy Celtic genius, and 
seems to come to us straight from the Isles of the 
Dead. That shadowy Ossianic spirit, as of your misty 
straits and your floating islands, reminds me exactly 
of the outlook from the western mountains over the 
summer-blue belted sea as I saw it once on an August 
morning at Oban. Too shadowy, sometimes, and too 
purely poetical, I fear, for your Saxon readers. But 
the opening sentences are beautiful, and the nature- 
studies and the sense of colour throughout are charming. 
Now, after so much praise, will you forgive a few ques- 
tions and a word of criticism ? You are, I take it, a 
young writer, and so an older hand may give you a hint 
or two. Don't another time interlard your English with 
Gaelic. Even a confirmed Celtomaniac like myself 
finds it a trifle distracting. Don't say ' the English ' 
and ' the Gaelic.' Give a little more story to less pure 
poetry. Of course I recognize that your work is an 
idyll, not a novel, a cameo, not a woodcut ; but even so, 
it seems to me a trifle too dreamy. Forgive this frank- 
ness, and remember that success still lies in the lap of 
the Saxon. And that we Celts have our besetting sins, 
and that perfection in literature lies in avoiding excess 
in any direction, even that of one's own best qualities." 

The so-called Celtic Revival of about ten 
years ago receives adequate attention in Mrs. 
Sharp's pages. Among the " six Celtic nations " 
forming the Celtic Association, various discord- 
ant opinions were held as to the proper aims of 



the federation ; but " William Sharp's great 
desire was that the Celtic spirit should be kept 
alive, and be a moulding influence toward the 
expression of the racial approach to and yearn- 
ing after spiritual beauty, whether expressed in 
Gaelic or hi the English tongue. He knew that 
there is a tendency, with the young of those 
people in Scotland at least, to put aside the 
beautiful old thoughts, or at all events their 
outward expression, with the disuse of the older 
language which had clothed those thoughts ; he 
feared that to put silence on them would be to 
lose them after a generation or two." But with 
the various little misunderstandings, and more 
or less heated discussions of questions relating 
to language and other details, we need not here 
further concern ourselves. The cause was a 
worthy one, and Sharp was its vigorous sup- 
porter. 

Three visits to this country were made by 
Sharp, and his biographer's account of them is 
of especial interest to us. His enjoyment of 
these new experiences, and his readiness to be 
pleased with the new friends and the new scenes, 
are manifest in his letters. In one giving his 
first impressions of New England he says : 

"Boston is a beautiful place an exceedingly tine 
city with lovely environs. Prof. A. S. Hardy ( Passe 
Rose,' etc.) was most kind. . . Cambridge and Harvard 
University are also very fine. I enjoyed seeing Long- 
fellow's house (Miss L. still occupies it), and those of 
Emerson, Lowell, etc. I spent brief visits to Prof. 
Wright of Harvard, to Winsor the historian, etc. On 
Sunday afternoon I drove with A. S. H. to Behnont in 
Massachusetts, and spent the afternoon with Howells, the 
novelist. He was most interesting and genial. I had 
the best of welcomes from the Stedmaus. They are 
kindness personified. The house is lovely, and full of 
beautiful things and multitudes of books. I have already 
more invitations than I can accept: everyone is most 
hospitable." 

There is much else in the book to which the 
reviewer would gladly call attention. Sharp's 
friendship with Walter Pater, and the corre- 
spondence between the two, are of csjM-cial inter- 
est, as are also the relations between Sharp and 
Philip Bourke Marston, and George Meredith, 
and countless others of note. His many-sided 
largeness of mind and soul required many and 
different friends. Something of this richness 
of spiritual endowment may be read in the por- 
traits of Sharp that occur in the book. They 
bear little resemblance to one another. In 
every change of pose and with every passing 
moment he is a different man, though always 
the same. His life, as told and compiled by 
his wife and life-long friend and comrade, is a 
biography of unusual variety of interest. She

ROMANTICISM ix LITERATURE AXD 



Every year the delvers in the French archives 
are increasing in number, and year by year the 
study of Romanticism is growing less Romantic. 
Files of letters in the Bibliothe'que Nationale, 
long withheld from publication for personal 
reasons, have been turned over to the printers ; 
old desks and family records are being opened to 
student and savant. The doctor's degree and 
the fureur de Vinedit the phrase is hardly 
translatable are filling the bookstores with 
volumes of literary antiquarianism ; and, if the 
present rate of publication continues, the seekers 
after " sources " will soon be without resource. 

One class of books, however, we have always 
with us, and shall have : secondary works, 
books about books. Of these the most inter- 
esting the most valuable too, perhaps, in an 
age tending all too swiftly toward a purely uni- 
lingual culture are the books which make 
available in English, facts or fiction originally 
published in another tongue. Whatever the 
scholar may think of such productions, their 
popular value cannot be denied, especially when 
they are written with the wit and cleverness 
which characterize Mr. Francis Gribble's studies 
in French literary history. 

" Passions of the French Romantics " ( sic) 
is the latest of a series of several volumes deal- 
ing with the personal life one might almost 
say the amative life of various French writers, 
from Rousseau to the great Romanticists. Why 
Mr. Gribble calls them " Romantics " we can- 
not imagine, unless he is attempting to anglicize 
the French romantiques. The authors con- 
sidered are Bernardin de Saint-Pierre (que 
diable allait-il faire dans cette galere!), 
Lamartine, Vigny, Musset, Hugo, Sainte- 
Beuve, Dumas pere, and Merimee ; Balzac and 
Gautier being excluded for no very evident 
reason, while George Sand finds an immoral 
immortality in an earlier volume of the series. 
The sources used, most of which Mr. Gribble 
mentions in his preface, are recent French 
biographies ; how closely he has followed them 
may be judged from the present reviewer's letter 
in a recent number of THE DIAL (June 16,

Gribble. Dlustrated. New York : Charles Scribner's Sons. 



1910, p. 416). Yet stories, whatever their 
origin, " ought to be entertaining if properly 
told "; so we may accept this statement of the 
preface in lieu of apology, seeing that the im- 
proper properly told constitutes a really difficult 
type of art. 

And Mr. Gribble tells his stories with all the 
propriety permitted by his subjects. The half- 
cynical detachment of his attitude is only sur- 
passed by the sprightly humor which never 
fails to lend interest to his pages. A richly 
allusive style is his, teeming with parody, 
irregular, full of suspensions and antitheses, a 
style conforming to no rule save that of interest. 
For a chronique scandaleuse such a style would 
be perfection ; yet there are passages in the 
loves of the Romantic school that can not be 
seriously treated as parts of a chronique scan- 
daleuse. Here at least, it must be admitted, 
Mr. Gribble fails. The tragedy of Vigny's 
disillusionment, the pathos of Sainte-Beuve's 
love for Mme. Hugo, the lyrical devotion of 
Lamartine, are things as far beyond his com- 
prehension as the style that could adequately 
portray them is beyond his power. Comedy 
speaks with one voice, one mask ; Tragedy with 
another. 

Clever and sprightly, nevertheless, the vol- 
ume certainly is ; and if picturesqueness be oc- 
casionally obtained by the sacrifice of important 
detail, as comparison with M. Seche's careful 
studies will show, we need not complain of it in 
a work of this sort. For the volume should stir 
up popular interest in the French Romanticists ; 
and it should undoubtedly correct some false 
impressions. 

One of these latter is the popular opinion of 
Victor Hugo as a man. What Americans know 
of the arch-Romanticist is derived mainly from 
Barbou's book, "Victor Hugo and his Times," 
long since translated into English, and the life 
of the poet written by his wife. Now both of 
these biographies were written under the eye of 
the master, the second one being dictated to 
Mme. Hugo by the poet himself ; and although 
extremely interesting, they are in a sense works 
of fiction, and the truth is not in them. It was 
reserved for a later scholar, M. Edmond Bire, 
to give us the negative side in a series of studies, 
as remarkable for their stinging irony as for 
their scholarly acumen. With this material to 
draw from, Mr. Gribble shows us how Victor 
Hugo, when he came to dictate his autobiog- 
raphy, was carried away by his poet's imagina- 
tion; how he falsified his genealogy to prove 
himself of noble family, how he magnified his 



330 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



precocity by antedating his earlier works, how 
he invented the phrase " enfant sublime " and 
attributed it to Chateaubriand for his greater 
glory. " That fact," as Mr. Gribble remarks, 
" is more sublime even than the eulogy itself." 
He tells us how Hugo concealed his failures, 
how he made twelve editions out of 1500 copies 
of Han cTIslande, how he published Amy 
Robsart under the name of his eighteen-year-old 
brother-in-law, who had nothing to lose, and lost 
nothing by the failure of the play. He pictures 
Hugo stepping out on his balcony, at a certain 
hour every day, to show himself, monarch-like, 
to the curious throng, and quotes, as further 
proof of the poet's megalomania, this incident 
from the Souvenirs sur Turgueneff: 

"One evening Hugo's admirers, assembled in his 
drawing-room, were competing with one another in the 
eulogy of his genius; and the idea was thrown out, 
among others, that the street in which he lived ought 
to bear his name. 

" Some one suggested that the street was too small 
to be worthy of so great a poet, and that the honour of 
bearing his name ought to be assigned to some more 
important thoroughfare. 

Then they proceeded to enumerate the most popular 
quarters of Paris, in an ascending scale, until one man 
exclaimed with enthusiasm that it would be an honour 
for the city of Paris itself to be renamed after the 
man of genius. 

"Hugo, leaning against the mantelpiece, listened 
complacently to his flatterers outbidding each other. 
Then with the air of one engaged in deep thought, he 
turned to the young man, and said to him in his grand 
style 

" ' Even that will come, my friend. Even that will 
come.'" 

"Not one of us, were he even a little dog, 
but feels himself the centre of the universe," 
says M. Anatole France. Few men, however, 
imagine that the universe is so becogged into 
the axis of their own genius. 

Yet the disclosure of Hugo's relations with 
the fair sex surpasses even this, and proves con- 
clusively that the building of the Hugo legend 
was the poet's greatest work of art. To make 
a muse out of a mistress, even when she be orig- 
inally another man's mistress, was not uncom- 
mon in the age of Romanticism, but to make 
of such a mistress a Madonna Beatrice, and 
force the world to swallow her, halo and all, is 
indubitably beyond the capacity of all but the 
highest type of genius. Yet this is what Hugo 
did for his Egeria, Juliette Drouet. And Mr. 
Gribble shows us the whole stupendous process 
of the apotheosis : Hugo collecting a public sub- 
scription to reclaim the repentant Magdalen 
she was, by the way, the artist's model immor- 
talized in the statue of Strasbourg, employing 



the proceeds of this subscription to set up a 
second establishment, printing verses to her in 
the same volume with verses to his wife ; while 
Madame HiiijM, in the meantime, was consoling 
herself with Sainte-Beuve, whose services as 
herald of Hugo's glory prevented for years a 
definite rupture. He shows us Hugo in after 
years, unfaithful even in his infidelity, caught 
in flagrante delicto by an irate husband, and 
obliged to show the medal which proved him 
Peer of France to escape arrest. He pictures 
him laying siege to Juliette's maids, and setting 
up a third establishment for one of them in his 
seventies. But most wonderful of all, perhaps, 
he shows us Mme. Hugo and her relatives recon- 
ciled with Juliette, so that the mistress-muse 
accompanies the Hugos in their exile, and sat at 
the poet's side in a banquet given in their 
honor, while Mme. Hugo, voluntarily (?) and in 
exquisitely chosen words proposed a toast to 
her forgiven rival. Well ! we should find it all 
pretty hard to believe, did we not know that 
they order these things differently in France. 
And lastly, Mr. Gribble shows us Hugo, the 
author of Uart d'etre grand-pere, taking his 
muse into his own household after his wife's 
decease, to be a companion to his grandchildren ; 
and when she died there a few years later, Paris 
had crowned her, as Mme. Hugo's cousin had 
crowned her long before, " the poet's immortal 
Beatrice, the sceptre-bearer of his glory." 

Scarcely less interesting, though for different 
reasons, is the story of MerimeVs Incoitt/nc 
and the narration of Musset's love-affairs sub- 
sequent to George Sand. The " grande passion " 
of Lamartine and the disillusionment of Vigny 
are, on the other hand, no subjects for Mr. 
Gribble's pen, and the lover of these poets 
would do well to pass them by. It is clever to 
say that Lamartine "was prone, like all the 
Romantics, to confuse the love of God with 
the love of his neighbour's wife," but epi- 
grams will not pay us for everything. There 
is a certain disillusionment in the thought 
that Vigny 's sorrow was caused by the betrayal 
of an actress like Marie Dorval, and even the 
thought of Musset consoling himself with the 
Pandemians of the pavement will tarnish, for 
some of us, the splendor of the Xtiit*. Alas! 
as long as we are Anglo-Saxons we shall rejoice 
that there exists no contemporary biography 
of Shakespeare. 

Wherein, then, apart from the sempiternal 
interest of gossip, lies the justification of such 
studies? The need of some justification our 
author evidently feels, and he indicates it at 



1910.] 



THE DIAL,

the conclusion of his preface. " The Romantic 
school was a period of experiments in life as 
well as in literature," says Mr. Gribble, " and 
there is nothing unnatural in a curiosity to 
know whether they failed or succeeded." This 
is why he has collected these stories, "to 
help students to consider for themselves whether 
or how far the Romantics [quel tic /] really 
served the cause of the liberty of the human 
spirit by that anarchism in their amours which 
was their common characteristic." But no Con- 
clusion helps the student in his conclusions ; 
and no analysis tells us how the principle of 
Romanticism developed and why it was bound 
to fail. 

Is the whole matter, after all, so perfectly 
obvious? That Rousseau inaugurated a new 
literature, a new conception of love, an apothe- 
osis of sentiment which was to culminate in the 
vagaries of " 1830," we all know ; but it is not 
so easy to trace the development of that earlier 
conception into the confusion of love and re- 
ligion which was the ruin of Musset and many 
another. M. Lasserre has done it, in his Roman- 
tismefranqais, a book which the serious student 
of this period cannot afford to miss. The mis- 
take of the great Romantic poets was their at- 
tempt to live out their dreams, a mistake which 
led to the most humiliating contacts with reality. 
Nor was this all. The Romanticists suffered 
one and all, as some of us are suffering 
to-day, from that self-poisoning through liter- 
ature, which, like opium, spoils for us the flavor 
of all natural food. Nordau has analyzed the 
habit in his " Paradoxen," and La Rochefou- 
cauld has stated the axiom in its extreme form. 
" There are men," says the great French mor- 
alist," " who never would have loved, if they 
had not heard others speak of love." And M. 
Lasserre shows us how this mania of love, of 
passion as the supreme end of life, spread its 
virus in a world wherein the bounds of conven- 
tional self-expression had been overthrown by 
the French Revolution and the coming of the 
Third Estate into literature and life. For the 
essentially bourgeois character of Romanticism 
may be verified in the vogue of Miss Marie 
Corelli, and its constant qualities may be noted 
in the love-letters of any maid-servant who has 
learned to read. 

A false conception of human life, it is no 
wonder that the Romantic theory came to the 
ground. Those who grasp at soap-bubbles will 
get only a drop of dirty suds, and they are 
indeed lucky who do not receive it in their eyes. 
" Almost all the passions of the Romantics,'' 



remarks Mr. Gribble, "ended in some sort of 
disappointment or some sort of anti-climax." 
So our experimenters found out that the theory 
of passion per se, or even the theory of love per 
se, does not square with any of the facts of life. 
The social organism may exist because of love, 
but it does not in any sense exist for the sake 
of love. 

With this we may return to Mr. Gribble's 
book, to add a final word. The volume is well 
illustrated, and the type large and pleasant to 
the eye. All in all, one could find far worse 
reading for a vacation trip than " Passions of 
the French Romantics." It reads very easily, 
this clever collection of literary gossip perhaps 
because it was undoubtedly written very easily. 
And in respect of its humorous qualities at 
least, no higher praise could be conceived.

A LITERARY HISTORY OF THE SOUTH.* 



The complaint is sometimes heard among 
Southerners that the South has been slow to 
recognize the worth of its own writers, and 
particularly that it has neglected to publish 
their merits abroad through the medium of the 
printed page. But certainly there is no longer 
any ground for such a reproach. During the 
last decade and a half there has come from the 
South no end of books about Southern writers. 
First, there was Miss Manly's " Southern Lit- 
erature " (1895); then came in rapid succession 
Miss Clark's " Songs of the South" (1896), Pro- 
fessor BaskervilTs " Southern Writers " (1897), 
S. A. Link's "Pioneers of Southern Literature " 
(1899), Professor Bradshaw's " Southern Poetry 
Prior to 1860 " (1900), Professor Weber's " Se- 
lections from the Southern Poets" (1901), a 
second volume of " Southern Writers " by Pro- 
fessor Baskervill's pupils (1903), Professor 
Trent's " Southern Writers " (1905), Professor 
Holliday's "A History of Southern Literature " 
(1906), and a year ago an encyclopaedic work 
entitled "The South in the Building of the 
Nation," in which several volumes are devoted 
to " The Literary and Intellectual Life of the 
South." Last spring saw the completion of 
" A Library of Southern Literature," another 
encyclopaedic undertaking, in fifteen large vol- 
umes. Since then, another volume of selections 
from Southern writers, by Professors Mims and 
Payne, has appeared. And now we have a new

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



history of the literature or, more precisely, 
a literary history of the South from the pen 
of Mr. Montrose J. Moses. 

Mr. Moses is not a native of the South, but 
his antecedents are Southern, and he writes with 
full sympathy for the Southern people and their 
literature and traditions. His attitude, however, 
is not at all that of " unreasoning idolatry." Of 
the literature of the Ante-Bellum South, for 
instance, he does not scruple to say (p. 456) that 
it was " at its best . . . provincial, over-florid, 
and over-sentimental "; and he admits (p. 431) 
that there is no great writing being done in the 
South to-day," though he promptly adds, and 
justly, that we have no right to believe that 
what is being done is not as excellent as the 
average elsewhere." 

The special contribution which Mr. Moses 
makes to his subject is in his consideration of 
the social, political, and economic forces out of 
which a Southern literature has developed. 
Indeed, it is upon this that chief emphasis is 
laid. He begins his book by insisting upon the 
intimate relationship between literature and life ; 
each of the five main divisions of his book 
devoted respectively to the Colonial, Revolu- 
tionary, Ante-Bellum, Civil War, and New 
South periods he introduces with a chapter 
on " Social Forces " ; and throughout the re- 
maining chapters he keeps constantly in view 
the interplay between life and letters. Of this 
aspect of his subject it is clear that he has 
made an industrious and intelligent study, 
familiarizing himself not only with the literature 
of the South but also with its history, and par- 
ticularly with the multitude of magazine articles 
bearing on conditions that have obtained at the 
South. It is not too much to say that his treat- 
ment of Southern literature in relation to its 
social and political origins is the fullest and the 
most satisfactory that has so far been made. 

In his enthusiasm for social origins, however, 
Mr. Moses has neglected somewhat the purely 
critical side of his subject. In his discussion 
of Colonial and Revolutionary literature, for 
example, he but rarely vouchsafes an opinion 
as to the actual worth of it all as literature ; he 
also excuses himself from any extended appre- 
ciation of the writers of the New South on the 
plea that " it is unwise to utter strictures at 
close view "; and when in his consideration of 
the Ante-Bellum and Civil War writers he does 
go more into detail, his appreciation is, as a 
rule, neither systematic nor very full. Nor are 
his critical judgments always convincing. Few 
students of Lanier would concur in the opinion 



that Lanier 's poems are without "strength" 
(see p. 875). If "Sunrise " and "The Marshes 
of Glynn " do not possess this quality, where 
else in all the poetry of the South shall wo find 
it? And, admire Hayne though we must, we 
shall scarcely be willing to admit that he was 
"at times the equal of Lanier in color and 
value of words " (see p. 396). There will be 
few, moreover, who will subscribe to the high 
estimate which Mr. Moses places upon the gift 
of Mrs. Augusta Evans Wilson to American 
letters. 

The volume is also open to criticism for sun- 
dry inaccuracies in minor details. The section 
devoted to Poe will serve for illustration. Here 
we are told (p. 277) that Poe "always con- 
tended ' that he was a Virginian ; in reality he 
advertised himself as a Bostonian on the title- 
page of his first volume of poems. Again, we 
are told (p. 279) that Poe sang of Mrs. Stanard 
not only in " To Helen," but in " Lenore," 
" Ulalume," and " Annabel Lee " as well ; 
whereas we can be reasonably certain that his 
wife was the inspiration of both "Ulalume" 
and " Annabel Lee." The novel which Poe is 
reputed to have written on the occasion of a 
visit to France (see p. 282) is, of course, 
altogether mythical. The title of his manu- 
script volume of tales for which he endeavored 
to find a publisher in the middle thirties was 
not " Tales of a Folio " (see p. 282), but " Tales 
of the Folio Club." Poe was not married to 
Virginia in 1834 (see p. 283), but in 1836. 
And it is not clear that Poe, before going to 
Richmond in 1849, wrote to Griswold asking 
him to be his literary executor (see p. 289); 
this is the testimony of Mrs. Clemm and Mrs. 
Weiss, but Griswold denied having received 
any letter, maintaining that the first information 
of his appointment came to him from Poe's 
friends "some ten days" after the poet's death. 

The style of Mr. Moses's work also has its 
imperfections. Though fairly brisk and enter- 
taining, it is not remarkable for its directness 
or for compression. And it is occasionally 
marred by lapses in idiom or in syntax. On 
page 344, for instance, occurs the locution 
" different . . . than "; at least twice a noun 
is made to refer appositively to an adjective 
(see pp. 71, 74); and there are several in- 
stances of the so-called "misrelated participle." 
The awkwardness of the sentence beginning 
" It maybe was this fitful humor which lost 
him the secretaryship to Virginia" (p. 32) is 
obvious. But, despite its limitations, the book 
makes an important contribution to our kiiowl-

Music IN ENGLAND.* 



It is on the whole a fortunate thing that 
men are seldom satisfied with what they have 
achieved. The incentive to renewed effort is 
thus perennial. Judging from Mr. Galloway's 
book on " Musical England," the author is by 
no means inclined to believe that his country- 
men have accomplished as much in the great 
art with which he deals as might reasonably be 
expected of them. He makes an exhaustive 
survey of the field, and, spurred by the deficien- 
cies which he discovers, points out the mani- 
fold opportunities for progress and improvement. 
This is not to say that he is discouraged with 
what he finds, or that he does not recognize 
how much has been done ; but he evidently has 
before him visions of a combined and varied 
activity which he hopes to see in full swing in 
the near future. 

It has been somewhat the practice to look 
with a sort of lenient depreciation on what 
England has produced in music. Comparisons 
have been made with her sister European 
nations, and the account has not been altogether 
in her favor. Yet England has done a distinc- 
tive work in music, and has never been without 
representatives to do her credit. Her madrigals 
and songs, her ballad operas, her Purcell, Arne, 
Sullivan, and Elgar, her Irish and Scotch 
melodies, are sufficient to ensure her place and 
recognition. Moreover, Handel's great career 
is part of her glory, and England has a right 
to claim his oratorios as her own. Mendelssohn 
is deeply indebted to her, and she has always 
been munificent to deserving composers calling 
with the artist's eagerness for recognition. This 
much needs to be said in deprecation of the 
somewhat apologetic tone which is found in 
Mr. Galloway's presentation of his subject. 

It is no easy task to disclose the widespread 
energies of a nation in an art which makes so 
deep a popular appeal as music. The canvas 
has to be stretched to take on the great picture, 
and the details begin to accumulate to such an 
extent that the unity of the representation is in 
danger of being lost to sight. Mr. Galloway, 
in the main, escapes the difficulty very well ; and

in the end we see how numerous are the instru- 
mentalities in working order, how coordinated 
they are, how intelligent and determined are the 
forces which are bound to bring decisive results. 

Mr. Galloway proceeds with the discussion of 
Music in the Universities, in the Great Schools, 
in the Army and Navy, in the Festivals ; he 
has much to say of the Competitions, which, 
having had small and obscure beginnings, are 
now among the organized means of developing 
musical intelligence and of reaching the larger 
public with compositions of a high order in 
ways not hitherto possible. He describes the 
work of the Musical Societies with which En- 
gland abounds, and shows how extensive their 
efforts have been. He repeats in substance 
what he has unfolded at length in his book, 
" The Operatic Problem," and grapples with the 
proposition how to establish the Music Drama 
on a firm basis in his country, how to bring it 
into genuine relation with the life of the people, 
translating it into the vernacular, and elevating 
it from its position as a mere amusement for 
the rich into a source of education for the great 
body of the nation. 

The picture is, on the whole, an inspiriting 
one. The universities are awakening to their 
responsibilities in this important concern. They 
are making increased demands on their students, 
requiring residence as conditional for degrees, 
asking original works of the successful winners 
of honors. As was to be expected, Oxford and 
Cambridge remain more or less conservative, 
and the pronounced advances have been made 
at less ancient institutions, Manchester and 
Birmingham. There are great music schools in 
England, the Trinity College of Music, the 
Royal Academy, and others, but none under 
the direction of the State as on the continent, 
and Mr. Galloway deplores to some extent the 
situation which he finds before him. The 
question, perhaps, is an open one. On all sides 
are to be found the indications of real interest 
and progress. The great Festivals have re 
ceived encouraging additions to their number, 
and the management of the new-comers has 
shown decided liberality in methods and arrange- 
ments over the time-honored ones. Mr.Galloway, 
moreover, puts great stress on the competitive 
movement ; a history of the movement is given 
and its present status outlined ; the competi- 
tions bring together musical societies, and prizes 
are awarded. They now are orchestral as well 
as vocal. Sir Hubert Parry says of them : 
" Competitions are quite among the most hope- 
ful signs of the times in this country. They

aim at spreading a knowledge of music in all 
its branches all over the country." 

In his closing chapter Mr. Galloway makes 
the following statement : 

I have tried to show how at home every form of 
musical activity, except opera, is flourishing and vigor- 
ous, while even the care for national opera is getting 
gradually stronger with the growth of public knowledge 
and responsiveness. But though it is certainly the 
widest and possibly the highest form of musical art, 
and though for these and other reasons already disclosed 
it offers the strongest claims for official support, the 
State Establishment of Opera is only a part of the 
largest possible conclusion that can be reached; for if 
the State is to interfere with music at all, there should 
be no limit in scope if not in detail to the measure 
of its control. There are many manifestations of musi- 
cal energy in this country; but the several forms of 
activity, whether due to private or corporate enterprise, 
are isolated and independent, and many of them are 
suffering from a lack of adequate support Only a 
suitable degree of control by a central authority can 
increase their individual efficiency and coordinate the 
separate parts into an interrelated and completely effec- 
tive whole ; and as to national opera, its establishment 
will be hastened and assured if the State once assumes 
its responsibilities to the entire field of music." 

It is not necessary to have Mr. Galloway's 
remarkable confidence in the contemporary 
State as the chosen power for establishing 
music firmly in England, or any other country, 
as a great living factor in the amelioration of 
mankind. Musical England, as set forth in 
this book, seems really in a prosperous condition, 
quite able to take care of itself, and not needing 
to make apologies to anyone. Mr. Galloway 
has a curious faculty of conjoining two con- 
tradictory estimates of the same matter in the 
same sentence. At first blush, this gives a 
somewhat depressing air to his whole discussion; 
but one soon finds out his secret, and the result 
is a hopeful view revealing at the same time 
certain limitations requiring to be remembered. 
The author unfolds his subject thoroughly and 
comprehensively. Musical England, whether 
in the past or present, claims its meed of con- 
sideration, and the future appears in colors 
reasonably bright and inspiring.

A HANDBOOK OF RELIGIOUS HISTOKY.* 

Dr. Reinach has written an ambitious work, 
which he has given an unfortunate title, be- 
cause not clearly descriptive, " Orpheus." 
The sub-title defines his aim : " An Universal 
History of Religions." The treatment is in 

ORPHBUS. An Universal History of Religion*. From 
the French of Salomon Reinach. Translated by Florence 
Simmcnds. New York : Q. P. Putnam's Sons. 



many respects clear, concise, catholic, and com- 
prehensive, but such subjects as Free Masonry, 
Mormonism, Mesmerism, Zionism, Spiritualism, 
and "Christian Science," seem rather out of 
place here, and the brief paragraph devoted to 
each is necessarily inadequate. Besides, these 
matters are too near us for historical treatment. 
But if recent movements are to be included in 
such a survey, surely modern Missions should 
receive more than a slight and unfriendly men- 
tion ; while organizations like the Young Men's 
Christian Association, and great reformatory 
and humanitarian enterprises so characteristic 
of our age (significant expressions of Applied 
Christianity), ought not to be ignored as they 
are in these pages. 

This treatise is not so apologetic as Clarke's 
" Ten Great Religions," which, however, had a 
powerful influence for good some forty years 
ago. The author is very appreciative of all 
forms of religious belief, with a slight tendency 
toward prejudice when papal matters are dis- 
cussed. The treatment is much fuller than in 
Tiele's Outline, but not so suggestive. It takes 
a wider range than Jordan's Comparative Re- 
ligion, but its descriptions of Buddhism and 
Brahman ism are all too brief, while Christianity 
occupies half its pages. 

The reviewer of this work is called to an un- 
pleasant task. The author has studied his 
general subject widely ; he is earnest in spirit ; 
he writes with much literary skill ; his chapters 
are interesting reading. But he attempts too 
large an undertaking. As a result, in many 
places his brief statements are unsatisfactory ; 
in some cases, quite erroneous. Such an asser- 
tion, for instance, as that the Anglican chim-h 
" is Calvinistic in spirit and Romanist in form" 
(p. 364), would hardly meet the approval of the 
Archbishop of Canterbury! And the author 
surely indulges in fiction when he claims (p. 69) 
that Christianity and Mithraism had a com- 
mon origin in one of those old Asiatic religions." 
A Baptist would hardly agree with him that 
his church has three grades of officers, " Elders, 
doctors [preachers], and deacons" (p. 361). 
Certainly there is little warrant for his putting 
Milton (p. 361) among the Baptists! His curt 
reference to the Book of Daniel as a " literary 
fraud " (p. 196) is hardly to his credit. The 
date of Swedenborg's birth (1688) is errone- 
ously given as 1680 (p. 391). 

To belittle Paul's interest in the man Jesus, 
by writing (p. 231) that the apostle may have 
talked with persons who knew him, is surely 
most inexcusable. To assert that " the historic

THE DIAL

Jesus is essentially intangible " (p. 226) is to 
join the modern myth-makers like Pastor Kalt- 
hoff. To state that Dr. Channing became a 
Unitarian in 1819 (p. 367), the date of his 
celebrated Baltimore sermon, is inaccurate ; to 
represent Emerson as the chief advocate of 
American Unitarianism is still more so. The 
description of the various Presbyterian churches 
of Scotland (p. 360) is confused. The followers 
of Ebenezer Erskine (1733) were not called 
Reformed Presbyterians, but " Seceders." Dr. 
Reinach represents Lalius and Faustus Socinus 
as teaching Unitarianism in Switzerland, which 
carries a false impression (p. 331). The remark 
that the Socinians fled from Poland and found 
refuge in Transylvania (p. 332) is not accurate. 
The Anabaptists did not become Unitarians (p. 
317), and Priestley was in no sense responsible 
for Boston Unitarianism as implied (p. 367). 
To assert (p. 363) that the founder of " Chris- 
tian Science " was Mrs. Eddy, is to hurry the 
aged mystic into her grave prematurely. In his 
references to the problem discussed at the Coun- 
cil of Nica3a (p. 260), the author is not clear ; 
and he does not quote the Nicene Creed with 
exactness. The passing allusion to the Salva- 
tion Army (p. 403) is certainly inadequate, and 
General Booth will hardly relish the statement 
that at present the spirit of the organization is 
" almost that of Unitarians " ! 

These, it may be said, are not major mistakes ; 
but they illustrate that lack of clearness of per- 
ception which mars many of the author's pages. 
Many subjects have not been sufficiently mas- 
tered to afford a firm grasp on details. These 
are serious defects in a historical work. But 
the treatise as a whole has some decided merits. 
The earlier chapters, where the totem, the 
taboo, and fetichism are discussed (Chap. I.), 
and especially the descriptions of the religions 
of the Celts and the Germans (Chap. IV.), 
form the best parts of the book.

BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 

For collectors " A History of Japanese Colour- 
of Japanese Prints" by Dr. W. von Seidlitz was 
color-print*. first published in Dresden in 1897. 
It was an attempt to put together in connected and 
coherent form the mass of valuable data scattered 
through the pages of various monographs, exhibi- 
tion catalogues, sale catalogues, and other sources 
not generally accessible. This was well done. The 
author showed excellent judgment and discrimina- 
tion in his reliance upon authorities, and the book 



at once took rank as the best popular work upon 
the subject. It is now reissued in an English trans- 
lation (Lippincott). For this edition the text has 
been revised throughout and considerable new 
matter has been incorporated with the intention of 
bringing it up to date. That aim, however, has 
been attained in part only ; it could not have been 
completely achieved without rewriting the entire 
work, for to a large extent it is a compilation, the 
views of the author being based upon the writings 
of Fenollosa, Anderson, De Goncourt, and others, 
more especially upon Fenollosa's epoch-making book, 
" The Masters of Ukioye," and apparently to a 
limited extent only upon personal study of the 
prints. In a measure the resultant lack of propor- 
tion is felt by Dr. von Seidlitz, but he does not 
seem to realize the extent to which his estimates of 
the leading print designers are colored by impres- 
sions derived from the examination of a compara- 
tively small number of their works; at least it is 
difficult on any other theory to account for his not 
ranking Okumura Masanobu much higher than he 
does, and for his altogether inadequate appreciation 
of Shunsho and Shigemasa. For his undue depre- 
ciation of Hokusai another explanation must be 
sought: it arises, in all probability, from Fenollosa's 
protest against the exaggerated estimate in Gonse's 
" L'Art Japonais," made not long after the publica- 
tion of that work in 1883. Harunobu, Kiyonaga, 
and Utamaro receive full meed of praise, but not 
as extended comment as is called for by the quality 
of their works and their importance in the history 
of the Ukiyoe school. Notwithstanding these and 
other shortcomings, the book gives the best general 
account of the color prints that has yet been pub- 
lished. It does not pretend to be a treatise for the 
collector which will do away with the need for 
independent research. Instead it is characterized 
by its author as " a provisional essay in the synthetic 
presentment of our knowledge of Japanese Colour- 
Printing," and as such it may be warmly com- 
mended. The uninformed reader, however, needs 
to be warned against the printer's errors, which are 
numerous and misleading. Even the list of errata 
on page xvi. contains a mistake, Shunko being 
printed " Shunki "! Not the least attractive feature 
of the volume is the illustrations, of which there are 
nearly a hundred. While not in all cases well 
chosen, they include reproductions of a number of 
very important prints. Sixteen are in color; of 
these, two are especially noteworthy, a remarkable 
fan by Shunsho and a striking print of an actor by 
Sharaku. 

Three subjects of interest nowadays 
are the position of woman, the object 
of education, and religion. There 
must be a good many men who are perplexed at 
finding that their wives dislike domestic life and 
wish to vote, or that their children go to school for 
years and learn little of what used to be important, 
or that they themselves like to play golf on Sunday

morning and to go motoring in the afternoon much 
better than they like to go to church. Many a man 
may think that women, children, church are not 
what they used to be. Such * one will perhaps 
like to read Mr. Andrew Macphail's " Essays in 
Fallacy " ( Longmans), which deal with these sub- 
jects. If by reading such essays a man were able 
to manage his affairs any better, we are sure there 
would be a large market for the book. Unfortun- 
ately, such discussions are usually effective only 
in a large way, in forming public opinion, so that 
their results are rarely discernible in one's own 
experience. Still the essays are interesting. They 
have something of a difficulty in that, though the 
author's general opinion in each case is pretty 
clear, one does not always know just how he gets 
to it. We saw in the publishers' announcement 
that the essay on "The Psychology of the Suffra- 
gette " was " a logical plea for the extension of 
the suffrage to women." On a first reading we 
had supposed that its tendency was to show that 
the idea of extending the suffrage to women was 
erroneous and delusive. On re-reading it we found 
the logical plea to be as follows : the female desires 
to keep to herself the genuine type which the male, 
by reason of her charm, is always tending to assume; 
if women vote they are free, if free they lose their 
charm, if they lose their charm men will not desire 
to approximate to them, which was the end to be 
desired. That such a result endangers the continu- 
ance of the human race is noted by Mr. Macphail, 
who adds that this does not invalidate the chain of 
argument. While pursuing his logical course, Mr. 
Macphail finds proof and illustration from a wide 
range of knowledge of the history of mankind. 
Indeed, his range is so wide that one sometimes has 
no idea of the connection of any given point with 
the general trend of the discussion. This makes 
hard reading now and then, but study will usually 
put one on the right track. If everyone would correct 
the fallacies or vulgar errors pointed out in this book, 
the world would be much better. It is to be hoped 
that Mr. Macphail's treatment will tend to this result 

Inasmuch as we have long desired 
a consecutive and comprehensive 
treatment of athletics among the 
gifted people who have taught the western world so 
much, we are glad to welcome Mr. E. Norman 
Gardiner's " Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals " 
(Macmillan). The book gives a scholarly presen- 
tation by a man who has both a genuine concern 
forathletics and a sound knowledgeof the sources for 
his study. The general reader will turn very rapidly 
many pages of the first part, which is mainly his- 
torical ; but he will doubtless linger over the second 
part, which takes up the principal athletic exercises 
one by one. However, the difference between the 
two main divisions is due rather to the nature of 
the themes than to inequality of execution, and the 
scholar will appreciate both. The il lustrations are 
admirably chosen and give valuable help at every

turn. A good bibliography and an accurate index 
also deserve commendation. The volume is the 
latest of the " Handbooks of Archaeology ami Anti- 
quities," and has the general mechanical excellence 
of the series. It is a little old-fashioned now to 
learn any lesson from the past ; but any thoughtful 
person with a care for the present and future of 
athletics will find in these pages a few stimulating 
suggestions, either implicit or offered directly. For 
instance: "The nemesis of excess in athletics is 
specialization," sounds very pertinent today ; and 
there are many other examples. Moreover the book 
recalls the thought, so familiar to any student of his- 
tory, that for at least a few decades in Greece 
athletics were a genuine glory, the human frame an 
inspiration and delight. And a few of us dream 
that once more a popular life of physical exercise 
and athletic games may rise to such an excellence 
and efficiency as to inspire the pen of the poet and 
the chisel of the sculptor. But Greek history makes 
it convincingly clear that such a development is not 
to be expected as long as students are contented to 
take their exercises by "rooting" for their sturdy 
champions, and the general public by watching 
professional baseball and reading the colossal, 
grotesquely-written accounts thereof in the "sport- 
ing " columns of our newspapers.

Nearly every book-lover and even

tucked away in a corner of his shelves 
the volume which first filled him with the love of 
reading and the passion for acquiring a library. 
Sometimes it is " Sesame and Lilies "; sometimes 
Mr. Frederic Harrison's essay, or a battered old 
Disraeli ; sometimes a work of a totally different 
sort. But whatever its title, we cannot help prizing 
such a volume as the virtual grandfather of our 
well-filled shelves ; and memories of its inspiration 
will lead us, if we be true lovers of books, to the 
purchase of Burton and Mr. Ireland's "Enchiridion," 
and that great avatar of this class of literature, 
still supreme after the lapse of five centuries, the 
" Philobiblon " of Richard de Bury. Professor 
Oscar Kuhns' " Love of Books and Reading " (Holt) 
is a welcome addition to this book-shelf ; and lucky 
will be the student who comes upon it in his forma- 
tive years. It cannot fail to stimulate, inspired as 
it is by broad reading and a real enthusiasm for 
literature ; and it will serve to remind us all of many 
books we have missed. " Read the great books " is 
the gist of its counsel "the books which make for 
humanistic culture "; but its wealth of literary anec- 
dote and its personal tone banish all triteness from 
a text which, after all, cannot be over-emphasized in 
this age of periodical-reading. We need to be re- 
minded of the riches of our great literary classics. 
We need to be told of the gems that time cannot 
destroy, now that so many are content to gather the 
surface outcrop of a baser carbon in the fields of 
contemporary literature ; and hence we can scarcely 
have too many books like this charming volume of 
Professor Kuhns', with its widely-gathered tributes 
to the love of books and the joys of reading. It is 
to be hoped that an index to the proper names may 
be added in a second printing. 

The Premier Prof essor Edward E. Hale, Jr., has 
of Lincoln's written for the interesting series 
administration. of "American Crisis Biographies" 
(Jacobs), a short life of William H. Seward, who 
surely can be classed as a leader in some of our 
greatest national affairs. The book differs from 
other brief biographies of Seward in its fuller 
account of the political movements and struggles in 
New York from 1830, the author thinking, rightly, 
that he could make his work most useful as a study 
of Seward's life and a contribution to the history of 
his times, by setting forth clearly the interesting and 
significant conditions in the state which has been the 
great political cauldron of the North ever since the 
government was established. The development of 
Seward's political principles is traced clearly with 
his growth in influence and power until he became 
a figure of national prominence. When he is 
transferred to Washington as senator, the treatment 



becomes broader, and we are given a general sketch 
of the anti-slavery movement and its issue in the 
Civil War, with Seward's part in the movement 
clearly set forth. And when he becomes what is 
sometimes called " the Premier of Lincoln's admin- 
istration," his part in affairs and his relations to his 
chief are fully and fairly given. It is possible that 
a perusal of the more recently published Diary of 
Gideon Welles, whose distrust of Seward appears 
not altogether without foundation, might have modi- 
fied some of the positions taken by Professor Hale. 
His book is well written, and the treatment is well 
balanced and comprehensive.

to do enough reading to get some sort of first-hand 
acquaintance with the authors they are supposed to 
be studying. The school or college library is apt 
to be a delusion, often providing a single copy of a 
work that is needed by a hundred students at the 
same time. Other accessible libraries do not help 
much, and few students have the necessary books 
at home. There appears to be no way out of the 
difficulty unless the literature can somehow be put 
into the hands of all the students at the same time. 
No text-book can be more welcome, then, than one 
that provides a great deal of well-selected literature 
at a moderate price, and two such books are now 
before us. The Century Co. publish "Century 
Readings for a Course in English Literature," 
edited by Messrs. Cunliffe, Pyre, and Young, of the 
University of Wisconsin ; and Messrs. Scott, Fores- 
man & Co. publish "Twelve Centuries of English 
Poetry and Prose," edited by Professor Newcomer 
and Miss Alice Andrews. Both are big books, 
which is the main consideration, and neither is over- 
burdened with editorial matter, which is also a 
merit. The former extends to over eleven hundred, 
and the latter to over seven hundred two-columned 
pages. The only very noticeable difference between 
the two books is that the latter gives a larger pro- 
portion of space than the former to Old English 
literature. No better works of their class have yet 
been provided for their common purpose, but we 
still await the publishing enterprise that shall offer 
a still larger amount of matter for a still lower 
price. Somewhere between a book of this sort and 
the daily newspaper that can be purchased for one 
cent there is an ideal mean of plentitude combined 
with cheapness that we hope will yet be reached. 



Socialistic 
leaders and 
tendencies. 



Though histories of socialism and 
books on socialistic writers are nu- 
merous, the little volume entitled 
"Leaders of Socialism " (Duffield), by Mr. G. R. S. 
Taylor, will have its place, and this for three reasons. 
It is written in a pleasing style ; it describes the 
work and opinions of thirteen of the more recent 
socialists, beginning with Owen and ending with 
Blatchford ; and, finally, it contains an introductory

esay of considerable though not great merit 
on leaders and leadership. Some readers will regret 
that French writers on socialism are represented only 
by Saint-Simon, Fourier, and Jaures ; while of the 
Germans there are only Karl Marx and Lassalle. 
Such limitation of subject-matter is the more notice- 
able in view of the inclusion of the Belgian dreamer, 
Louis Blanc. The English writers treated, besides 
those previously mentioned, are William Morris, 
H. M. 1 1 v in 1 man. Sidney Webb, J. Kier Hardie, and 
G. Bernard Shaw. The author regards Owen as the 
true founder of socialism, and considers Hyndman 
as the most important living English socialist The 
standpoint in this volume may be regarded as truly 
orthodox. The author does not appear to realize 
that the latest trends in socialism are to extol private 
property in the personal relationships of life and to 
regard the monogamous family as a social necessity. 
The scientifically-minded reader will find the book 
too much suffused with the spirit of Mr. Bernard 
Shaw; the average reader will find it bright and 
entertaining. 

The second and third series of the 
&. " Memoirs" or journal of the Duch- 

esse de Dino (afterward Duchesse 
de Talleyrand et de Sagan), edited with notes and 
a biographical index by the Princesse Radziwill 
(nte Castellane), and published in this country by 
the Scribners, fill each a closely-printed octavo of 
more than four hundred pages. The second volume 
covers the years 1836-40, and the third the years 
1841-50. The diary entries are generally short, 
touch on contemporary politics and on persons of 
note, and were jotted down in various towns and 
large cities of France, Germany, and Austria, the 
French and the German capitals being apparently 
the writer's favorite resorts. The revolutionary 
scenes of 1848 naturally affect the Duchesse with 
horror, and inspire all sorts of gloomy forebodings. 
Her prejudices and friendships, and her nearness 
to the stirring events noted by her pen, of course 
incapacitate her for the office of dispassionate his- 
torian, although her pages are of the stuff from 
which histories are made. The notes, indices, and 
appended matter, written or selected by the careful 
editor, are of use for a scholarly mastery of the 
volume*. 



\OM>. 



"Anti-Matrimony^" Mr. Percy Mackaye's satirical 
drama now nmning in New York, will be issued in book 
form this month by the Frederick A. Stokes Co. 

An important literary biography is announced in Mr. 
Frederick Lawton's " Balzac," soon to be issued by the 
Wessels & Bissell Co. The volume will contain a 
number of interesting illustrations. 

To the series of " Little Books on Art" (McClnrg), 
a miniature treatise on " Christian Symbolism " has just 
been added. The author is Mrs. Henry Jenner, and 
there are twoscore of well-chosen illustrations. 



Mr. Kipling's new collection of stories, "Rewards 
and Fairies,'' wakes a prompt appearance in the hand- 
some ' Outward Bound " edition, published by Messrs. 
Si-nhiicr. It constitutes Volume XXV. of the set. 

It is some time since we had a new book from Mr. 
Joseph Conrad. He has been engaged for a year or so 
past on a new story that is now nearing completion, and 
will make its appearance presently under the title of 
" Razunov." 

Mr. Edgar Beecher Bronson's entertaining " Reminis- 
cences of a Ranchman," formerly published by the 
McClure Co., now appears in a new edition, with some 
added chapters, bearing the imprint of Messrs. A. C. 
McClurg & Co. 

The volume called " Vanitas : Polite Stories " is 
added by the John Lane Co. to their reissue of the 
books of " Vernon Lee." Besides the three stories 
hitherto included under the title, there is now a fourth, 
"A Frivolous Conversion," here printed for the first 
time. 

The perennially popular German-American dialect 
verses of Mr. Charles Follen Adams have lately been 
put forth by the Lothrop, Lee & Shepard Co. in a new 
edition entitled Yawcob Strauss and Other Poems." 
The familiar line drawings of the earlier editions are 
retained in this. 

"The Book Monthly "of London signalizes its seventh 
birthday by a considerable enlargement in size and 
improvement in editorial and mechanical features. We 
can cordially recommend this sprightly magazine to 
every American reader who cares to keep in touch with 
affairs of the English book world. 

Professor F. W. Taussig's "The Tariff History of 
the United States " is the soundest discussion of the 
subject ever written, and has had frequent revisions. 
The latest of them (the fifth) is brought down to date 
by a chapter on the Aldrich-Payne Act of 1909. 
Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons are the publishers. 

"The American Jewish Year Book " for 5671, sent 
us by the Jewish Publication Society of America, has 
for its special feature this year an eighty-page article 
In Defense of the Immigrant." The other contents 
of the work remain much the same as in previous 
annual issues. Mr. Herbert Friedenwald is the editor. 

It is interesting to note in connection with the Hon. 
John Redmond's tour in this country in the interests of 
Irish Home Rule, that the Frederick A. Stokes Co. 
announces for publication his new book " Home Rule," 
containing all the speeches delivered during his entire 
parliamentary career. An introduction gives a short 
summary of the history of Ireland's struggle. 

Lovers of the late Sarah Orne Jewett's inimitable New 
England stories will be grateful for the attractive new 
edition of her best work just issued by the Houghton 
Miftlin Co. The edition is in seven small volumes, 
handsomely printed and bound, and containing photo- 
gravure frontispieces. A hitherto unpublished story 
of Miss Jewett's is included in the last volume of the set. 

In view of the approaching centenary of the birth of 
Charles Dickens special interest attaches to the " Centen- 
ary Edition " of the novelist's complete works, which 
Messrs. Charles Scribner's Sons are bringing out, in 
conjunction with Messrs. Chapman & Hall, Ltd., of 
London. In this edition all the prefaces, dedications, 
and notices which appeared in the various editions dur- 
ing the author's lifetime will be given, together with all 
the original illustrations to which he gave his approval.

The illustrations are being reproduced by a special new 
process from the original steel plates and wood-blocks, 
and will number close upon seven hundred. The type 
used is large and readable, the paper of excellent 
quality, the binding handsome, and the price unusually 
reasonable. 

Mr. Prentiss Cummings is the latest translator of the 
" Iliad." He chooses the hexameter verse, a procedure 
which he defends at length aud with considerable skill. 
The maiu novelty of his translation is that he has made 
it frankly an abridgment, omitting all the dull and 
otherwise inferior parts. By this heroic measure, he 
has reduced the epic to about one-half its full dimensions. 
The work occupies two volumes, and is published by 
Messrs. Little, Brown, & Co. 

School reading books recently published by the 
American Book Co. include " Peter of New Amster- 
dam," by Mr. James Otis; Cooper's " The Last of the 
Mohicans," adapted to the use of children by Miss 
Margaret N. Haight; and "Stories of American Dis- 
coverers for Little Americans," by Miss Rose Lucia. 
From the same publishers we have a book of " Easy 
French Prose Composition," by Miss H. A. Guerber. 

As a companion to the various " Standard " musical 
guides that he has published from time to time, and 
that have been so helpful to concert and opera-goers, 
Mr. George, P. Upton has now given us a volume of 
" Standard Musical Biographies," dealing with over a 
hundred composers, and very interestingly illustrated. 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg publish this work, as well as its 
numerous predecessors. 

A new volume of the " Original Narratives of Early 
American History" (Scribner) gives us a selection of 
"Narratives of Early Maryland, 1633-1684," edited 
by Mr. Clayton Colman Hall. There are sixteen num- 
bers in the volume, beginning with Lord Baltimore's 
" Instructions " and Father White's " Brief e Relation," 
and ending with extracts from the journal of George 
Fox and reports of the negotiations between the third 
Baron Baltimore and William Penn. 

Miss Clara Sherwood Stevens must be an ardent 
admirer of Herbert Spencer, for only to such would 
the thought have occurred to ransack his writings for 
" elegant extracts," as if he were a brilliant stylist 
instead of being a writer of very dull and uninspired 
prose. The result of this undertaking is given us in 
" Passages from the Philosophy of Herbert Spencer," 
a volume published by Mr. Thomas B. Mosher in the 
distinctive form which he has made his own. 

The Neale Publishing Co., New York, are engaged 
in producing a ten-volume edition of " The Collected 
Works of Ambrose Bierce," an imperfectly appreciated 
genius of the Pacific Coast. His admirers go far in 
praising him, Mr. Markham saying that " he has his seat 
in the remote and ruby-litten chamber of Hoffman and 
Poe," and Mrs. Atherton that he " has the best brutal 
imagination of any man in the English-speaking race." 
Mr. Bierce is editing his own works, which makes the 
publication authentic. The first volume, now at hand, 
is certainly a handsome and dignified piece of book- 
making. 

It was only in 1900 that Mr. Bertram Dobell announ- 
ced his discovery of the unpublished works of the 
seventeenth century author Thomas Traherne. Now 
Mr. H. I. Bell has had the good fortune to discover an 
unknown and unpublished MS. of Traherne in the 
British, Museum,evidently prepared by the poet's brother 



for publication. The MS., which is entitled " Poems 
of Felicity: Vol. I., containing Divine Reflections on 
the Native Objects of the Infant-Ey," contains thirty- 
nine new poems. The " Poems of Felicity " will be 
issued immediately by the Oxford Press in its " Tudor 
and Stuart Library." 

The November issue of " The Century " marks the 
fortieth anniversary of the magazine, and contains as a 
special feature twenty pages of text and pictures, mar- 
shalling some of the magazine's more notable contribu- 
tions to the progress of illustration during its history. 
There is also an interesting "Retrospect of the Century" 
in the " Topics of the Times " department. The open- 
ing chapters of Mr. Robert Hichens's new novel, "The 
Dweller on the Threshold " appear in this issue. 

Of the late Russell Sturgis's numerous contributions 
to the literature of his chosen field, no other made so 
varied and direct an appeal to the art lover as his two- 
volume work entitled "The Artist's Way of Working," 
published in 1905. In reissuing this work at one-third 
of the original price, Messrs. Dodd, Mead & Co. have 
now provided an opportunity which should not fail to 
be liberally taken advantage of. The entire text and all 
of the illustrations are retained in the present reprint. 
Mr. E. K. Chambers, one of the foremost Shake- 
spearian scholars of England, has now completed his edi- 
tion of Shakespeare, a task of ten years. The H. M. Cald- 
well Company have secured the American rights of this 
" Red Letter Edition," as it is called, and will issue it 
at once in thirty-nine dainty pocket volumes. An ex- 
cellent feature, both useful and ornamental, of this 
edition is that the names of the characters are printed 
in full in red-lettering, so that the reader is spared the 
task of deciphering clumsy abbreviations. To each play 
Mr. Chambers has contributed an introduction. 

The latest volume of Bohn's Library (Bell-Macmillan) 
consists of More's " Utopia " in the contemporary trans- 
lation of Ralph Robinson, with Roper's Life of More 
and a selection from his letters. The text, edited by 
Mr. George Sampson, is practically identical with that 
of the folio reprint in the " Chiswick Library of Noble 
Authors," issued in 1903. To the present edition a 
rather trite introduction is contributed by Mr. A. Guth- 
kelch, who also supplies a useful bibliography. The 
Latin text of the first edition is given in an appendix. 
Like all of Messrs. Bell's publications, the volume is 
very attractively produced. 

Our ambassadors to England have usually been men 
who could represent worthily the best of America, and 
it has been taken as an important part of their duty to 
interpret their country to Englishmen. Mr. Choate 
went to England with a fine reputation as a graceful 
and eloquent speaker, and was called on to speak on 
many important occasions. The addresses that he gave 
are now collected under the title "Abraham Lincoln, 
and Other Addresses in England " (Century Co.) . The 
address on Lincoln is already on the way to become a 
classic, both for substance and for form. The addresses 
on Franklin and Hamilton, and on the Supreme Court, 
accomplish the writer's purpose of making the people of 
another country acquainted in a general way with those 
great Americans and with our greatest political inven- 
tion. There are eleven papers in all; besides those 
named, those on Emerson, Education in America, and 
other subjects, are slighter in structure, well adapted to 
the occasions when they were given, but hardly of per- 
manent value.

Primitive Psychotherapy 
and Quackery 

By ROBERT MEANS LAWRENCE, M.D. 

Author of "The Magic of the Horse- 
shoe," etc. 

A historical survey of the so-called 
"magical remedies "of olden times such 
as medical amulets and charms show- 
ing that they are in reality the forerunners 
of modern psychical medicine. Dr. Law- 
rence has sought to emphasize the fact that 
the efficiency of many primitive therapeutic 
methods, and the success of charlatanry, 
are to be attributed to mental influence.

Editor. With portraits, large i2mo, $1.75 net; by mail, $1.90. 
(Just ready.) 

Each biography in this volume, which has been in prepara- 
tion for some years, is by an authority; often the author has 
been an intimate personal associate of his subject. Beyond 
the unusual interest and value of the biographical matter, the 
volume presents an outline of the progress of science from the 
interesting viewpoint of the dominant personalities in its devel- 
opment. 

There are biographies and critical estimates of the work of 
Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, by E. E. Slosson; Alex- 
ander Wilson, by W. Stone; /. J. Audubon, by W. Stone; 
Benjamin Silliman, by D. C. Oilman ; Joseph Henry, by S. 
Newcomb ; Loltis Agassi z, by C. F. Holder ; Jeffries Wyman,

sen ; W. K. Brooks, by E. A. Andrews.

The A. L. A. Booklist marks for first purchase and comments upon the 
last two volumes in " The American Nature Series " as follows : 

Albee, Mrs. Helen (Rickey). Hardy plants for cottage 
gardens. 309 pp., illus. *$i.6onet. 

A pleasing record of the mistakes and successes of an enthusiastic and 
patient woman gardener, illustrated by photographs and a full plan of the 
completed garden. Its best feature for amateurs is a list classified by color, 
planting-month (43 north latitude) and kind (shrubs, annuals, etc.) with 
descriptions and cultural directions. Best book for modest garden plans 
since Ely's Woman's hardy garden. 

Fernow, Bern hard Eduard. The care of trees in lawn, 

street, and park. 392 pp., illus. *$2.OO net.

forestry," lists of trees and shrubs for various decorative uses, and a 2 p. 
list of books on cognate subjects. Helpfully illustrated. 



The Last of the Mohicans Illustrated by E. Boyd Smith 

This classic in a form at least as attractive and modern as that of the new and untried juveniles, 
will, it is hoped, appeal to young folks. The text is complete, with eight full pages in color 
and forty line-drawings by E. Boyd Smith. Special Library binding. $1.35 net. (Just ready.)

With 25 full-page illustrations. 8vo, $3.50 net. (Postpaid $3.72.J 

Dr. Hamilton places before the public much uew material some of it in the form of letters to and from 
Hamilton never before published. Emphasizing Hamilton's private and family life, he gives a peculiarly 
accurate and intimate insight into the social and political life of this country and especially New York. 

" He confines himself, rather, to the characterization of his grandfather through a series of chapters on 
those matters which bring him closer to us as a man. This is an ' intimate ' portrait, and as such it has engaging 
simplicity, sincerity, and vividness. No one who cares for American history will fail to read it. " New York Tribune. 

Moliere: His Life and His Works

Prof essor of Dramatic Literature in Columbia University. Illustrated. 8vo, $3.00 net. (Postpaid $3.30.) 
Professor Matthews presents the most complete, masterly, and notable biography in English of the great 
dramatist. He sets forth the facts of Moliere's life stripped of all the legends that have gathered about it. 
At the same time he gives a striking picture of the period in which Moliere lived, and of his relation to it. 

This is a new and illuminating biography and ought to be read by every one who is interested in the drama, 
practically or esthetically. " Jeanette L. Gilder, in Chicago Tribune.

" A GREAT, EVEN A NOBLE BOOK. " 



THE HOUSE OF BONDAGE 

By REGINALD WRIGHT KAUFFMAN 

lgaio > $ L35 NeL ** 



EDWI N M ARKH AM writes : 

" A book that disturbs, that flashes light, that will not let you rest. ... A book that blurs the eyes and stirs the 

heart with the pity of it. With nobility of manner, with a sincerity that touches the subject as with fire, in a 

purity that burns away all impurity, Mr. Kauff man relates this story." 

JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, Jr., writes, in part : 

" I have read ' The House of Bondage ' with much interest. The story is inexpressibly sad, but sadder still is the 

knowledge that it is true to life true not only in the exceptional case, but in hundreds and doubtless thousands of cases. 

The author has handled a difficult subject with the utmost of delicacy consistent with perfect frankness. While 

telling his story fearlessly, he does so without sensationalism. I believe that the conditions with which the book deals 

must be generally known before they will be improved, and that the publicity thus given them will be of great value." 

This great, sincere novel is making the profoundest impression all over the country. Its sales are steadily growing 

in every direction; it is making the whole nation think. 

"I WISH I COULD FORGET THIS NOVEL, BUT IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, ITS WAILING CRY IN THE NIGHT 

RINGS OUT LIKE THE NEVER CEASING SOBBING TOLL OF A GHOSTLY BELL." Portland Oregonian. 

" It is a book for the thoughtful, not for the careless reader. If it were not for its sincerity, no words could be 

too strong for voicing its condemnation." Brooklyn Eagle. 

" The novel is artistically, cleanly, and beautifully written. Mr. Kauffman gave much pains and unusual talent to 

a noble purpose." Hartford Courant.

Some Comments 

4 4 HPHIS rich, composite history of English literature is a real service to 

J[ English scholarship. It presents us wtth the first adequate treatment 

of many neglected parts of our literary history, and it throws new 

light on many old themes. . . . The editors deserve all thanks, and the 

critic who feels inclined to quarrel with this point or that in their methods 

or conclusions will be humilated and silenced when he remembers that this 

is the first attempt by a body of scholars to tell the story of our literature on 

a scale worthy of its greatness." The Saturday Review. 

"A clear and convincing estimate, and one in which everything that is of 
outstanding significance is skillfully disentangled from the vast mass of 
subsidiary clues to interpretation. It seems to us that this is the supreme 
merit of the volume, the discrimination and judgment with which it brings 
to a focus the gradual evolution of a language and the wonderful outburst 
of creative achievement in letters under the Tudors."- London Standard.

THE LITERATURE OF THE SOUTH

"This splendid volume of 500 page* is the first complete, vital, honest recapitulation of the 
achievement of the South in American letters that we have yet had, and, as a work of interpretative 
criticism, it is one of the sanest, most wholesome, most convincing books that has appeared in this 
country for some time. Mr. Moses, while confining himself to a small section of our literature, has 
set a noble example of how literary history should be written and of how literary valuations should 
be established. . . . 

" His book is earnest and spirited, marked by fine judgment, by clear insight, by a wholesomeness 
of candor and a fairness of verdict which leaves finally a just conception on the mind of the reader. . . . 

" To read this book in its completeness is to get a fine idea of the harmony of life and literature in 
the South, and a more perfect understanding of the men and women who with splendid enthusiasm 
sought to build up a literature out of their lives and interests, to get an understanding of the handicap 
which was placed upon them by the fixedness of their lives and the imperviousness of their condition to in- 
novation by the too placid and satisfied intellectual foundations of their environment." St. Paul Dispatch.

" In the course of an argu- 
ment on the vital question 
standing between a great com- 
munion like the Episcopal 
Church and other Christian 
Churches, it is difficult to re- 
strain prejudice and to reason 
dispassionately. But the 
scholarly Presbyterian minis- 
ter, Dr. Thompson, proceeds in this book with an 
examination of this difficult and confused subject in 
an admirable spirit of profound Christian regard for 
those who differ from his opinions. And he brings 
to his task a thoroughly trained and well furnished 
mind eager to arrive at the facts in the case. His 
avowed purpose is not to be polemic, but to promote 
harmony, and to present the facts in the interests of a 
mutual understanding that may help to solve the diffi- 
culties that cluster abont this question of Episcopacy 
for Christian people desirous of closer union. Tl- 
results of his long study and thought are clearly 
presented, and his treatment of the theme is so 
candid, honest, considerate and illumating that 
the book will long remain one of the best on the 
subject for the general public."

The Most Amazing Human Document of Recent Years 

China under the Empress Dowager 

Being the History of the Life and Times of Tzu Hsi 

Compiled from State Papers and the Private Dairy of the Comptroller of Her Household 
By J. O. P. BLAND and E. BACKHOUSE 

For the first time this remarkable volume lifts the veil that diplomacy allowed to fall over 
the late Empress Dowager's share in the Boxer outbreak during the summer of 1910. 

It begins with an introductory history of the Yehonala family, and graphically covers 
the stirring incidents and happenings during Tzu Hsi's eventful reign from her first 
regency to her death. It also incorporates the diary of His Excellency Ching Shan 
which is more illuminating than perhaps any document that has ever come out of China. 
In it is recorded what actually took place from day to day in the Forbidden City during 
the seige of the Legations, and what was the manner and cause of many strange inci- 
dents during that period of stress and storm.

A PROPHET OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. 



The great preacher and even greater citizen 
whose half -century of life was ended half a cen- 
tury ago is commemorated during the present 
week by exercises held in Chicago, enlisting the 
services of leaders of religious and secular 
thought gathered from far and wide to honor a 
great spiritual force. If ever a man deserved 
well of his fellows, it was Theodore Parker, 
whose strong and noble personality shines in an 
ever clearer light as the age in which he lived 
and labored recedes from our view. The pre- 
sent celebration is significant of several things. 
It betokens the posthumous reward of which a 
good man is assured however prejudice may 
withhold it during his lifetime. It shows the 
softening of old animosities under the healing 
influence of the years. It indicates the widen- 
ing of the thoughts of men with the process of 
the suns and the slow but sure advance of 
liberalism in the sphere of religious discussion. 
The work of such men is like the ministry of 
the Red Cross upon the battle-field, forecasting 
the transition of the world from the age in which 
warfare is possible to the age in which smiling 
harvests shall enter into lasting possession of 
the erst ensanguined meadows. Incidentally, 
the fact that Chicago rather than Boston is the 
place in which Parker's memory is this week 
chiefly honored is highly significant, denoting 
as it does the occupancy by the idealism which 
he preached of what was to him only a frontier 
outpost of the national civilization. 

Prejudice dies hard, and the bitterness with 
which Parker was assailed while he lived still 
finds an occasional echo. The invitation to join 
in the celebration sent to such as might pre- 
sumably wish to cooperate elicited a curious 
variety of responses. About fifteen per cent 
of the whole number invited replied with an 
uncompromising " No." The others expressed 
approval with varying degrees of cordiality, 
ranging from unqualified enthusiasm to very 
reserved and guarded forms of acceptance. One 
clergyman wrote : " The world owes a vast debt 
to Theodore Parker. He was the prophet of 
everything large and catholic and beautiful in 
the religious consciousness and life. He richly 
deserves our reverence and love." But another 
member of the clerical profession (evidently 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



turning one eye in thought upon the congrega- 
tion) wrote : " I would be misunderstood if I 
should sign the call. Kindly excuse me, and 
allow me to attend as many sessions as I may 
be able when the meetings are held." Between 
these two expressions of opinion there is a con- 
siderable difference, but a still wider gulf exists 
between either of them and the following truly 
" moss-back " clerical utterance : My convic- 
tion is that the world would be better off if 
Theodore Parker had never lived nor written. 
His denial of the fundamentals of historic 
Christianity has, in my judgment, been a curse 
to New England, and all who have been in- 
fluenced by it. While New England has grown 
in head, it has decayed at heart, through the 
influence of leaders like Theodore Parker." 
Such words as these, which the prodigious Cot- 
ton Mather would feelingly endorse, could he 
revisit the glimpses of the moon and learn the 
degenerate doctrines now preached in his own 
pulpit, show that the missionary opportunities 
of liberalism are still considerable. But we 
are not sure that we are not more in sympathy 
with this attitude than with that of the man 
who, for the sake of appearances, would rather 
not stand up and be counted. 

The student who delights in historical paral- 
lels will find it interesting to compare the cases 
of Theodore Parker and Thomas Paine. Both 
professed substantially the same form of Unit- 
arian belief ; both boldly proclaimed the Rights 
of Man and served (like Heine) as valiant sol- 
diers in the War of Liberation ; both incurred 
that odium theologicum which holds no slander 
too vile, and no weapon too base, to direct 
against the assailants of the citadel of orthodoxy. 
And both now have their meed of honor, tardily 
bestowed and not yet in full measure, as patriots 
and thinkers who lived before the time was 
ripe for them, who knew ingratitude and mis- 
representation and calumny, and who gladly 
suffered these things for the faith that was theirs. 
It has taken a long while for the mists to clear 
away from their figures, and for their com- 
manding stature to become fully revealed. 

That fine old specimen of the crusted Tory, 
Governor Berkeley of Virginia, complained of 
those among the clergy who indulged in the 
pernicious practice of applying their pulpit 
teachings to practical affairs and questions of 
the day. His advice to them was that they 
should pray more and preach less. The New 
Englanders who found their consciences un- 
comfortably troubled by Theodore Parker's 
exhortations would have thought Governor 



Berkeley a very fountain-head of wisdom. For 
Parker always went straight to the point. "I 
have preached against intemperance, showing 
the monstrous evil of drunkeness, the material 
and moral ruin it works so widely. My first 
offence in preaching came when I first spoke on 
the misery occasioned by this ghastly vice. The 
victims of it sat before me, and were in great 
wrath ; they never forgave me." And so it was 
with the sin of covetousness, and the tyranny 
of the rich over the poor, and the lack of in- 
spiring ideals in education, and the subjection 
of women, and the exaltation of law above 
justice, and the worship of political idols with 
feet of clay, and the wickedness of war, and the 
infamy of slavery, that " sum of all villainies," 
and the errors of the ecclesiastical theology, 
the most fatal mischiefs in the land." These 
matters are in their nature contentious, and 
their discussion in the light of truth and reason 
during the forties and fifties was a braver 
thing than it would be now. But Parker never 
shrank from what he believed to be his duty as 
a spiritual leader, and while angry passions rose 
and surged about him, held steadily to his 
course. It is for this forthright manliness and 
sincerity that we honor him to-day, and realize 
how much he helped in the crusade against the 
evils which chiefly enlisted his voice and pen. 
We have called Parker a prophet of right- 
eousness, for in that character he may now 
clearly be viewed. We hear much mouthing 
about righteousness in our own day and in 
one notable instance but what lip-service it 
often appears when we attempt to square it with 
the practice of those who preach it ! In Parker's 
case there was no such antagonism between 
thought and act, and his life was the exemplifi- 
cation of his creed. He not only declaimed 
against intemperance and corrupt politics and 
evil social conditions, but he was an active 
worker in the cause of reform. He was not 
content to inveigh against slavery from the 
pulpit, but when occasion offered he aided with 
his own arm in the rescue of the fugitive slave. 
And he was a prophet because the eternal 
verities were apparent to him. In every cause 
for which he wrought, time has shown more and 
more distinctly that his judgment was sound 
and his vision clear ; the path of progress has 
been ever since, and still remains, in almost 
every case that which he indicated to a stubborn 
and incredulous public. A bare twelvemonth 
before his death, he could make the proud boast 
that a subsequent half-century has amply justi- 
fied : " In the last dozen years, I think scarcely 



1910.] 



THE DIAL

any American, not holding a political office, has 
touched the minds of so many men, by freely 
speaking on matters of the greatest importance, 
for this day and for ages to come. I am sure 
I have uttered great truths, and such are never 
spoken in vain." 

In his discourse upon the life of Webster, 
Parker said : " The two chief forms of American 
action are Business and Politics, the commer- 
cial and the political form. The two humbler 
forms of our activity, the Church and the 
Press, the ecclesiastic and the literary form, 
are subservient to the others." When near the 
end of his days, he amplified this statement as 
follows : 

1. There is the organized trading power having 
its home in the great towns, which seeks gain with 
small regard to that large justice which represents alike 
the mutual interests and duties of all men, and to that 
humanity which interposes the affectional instinct when 
conscience is asleep. This power seems to control all 
things, amenable only to the all-mighty dollar. 

2. The organized political power, the parties in 
office, or seeking to become so. This makes the stat- 
utes, but is commonly controlled by the trading power, 
and has all of its faults often intensified; yet it seems 
amenable to the instincts of the people, who, on great 
occasions, sometimes interfere and change the traders' 
rule. 

3. The organized ecclesiastical power, the various 
sects which, though quite unlike, yet all mainly agree 
in their fundamental principle of vicariousness an 
alleged revelation, instead of actual human faculties, 
salvation from God's wrath and eternal ruin, by the 
atoning blood of crucified God. This is more able than 
either of the others; and though often despised, in a 
few years can control them both. In this generation 
no American politician dares affront it. 

4. The organized literary power, the endowed 
colleges, the periodical press, with its triple multitude 
of journals commercial, political, theological and 
sectarian tracts. This has no original ideas, but diffuses 
the opinions of the other powers whom it represents, 
whose will it serves, whose kaleidoscope it is." 

Could anyone make a keener and truer analysis 
than this of the America of our own day ? We 
point to it in justification (if any be needed) of 
the present celebration of the life of Theodore 
Parker, preacher, patriot, and prophet of right- 
eousness. A number of the eminent men who 
replied to the invitation which asked for their 
cooperation in the memorial exercises of this 
week confessed that they knew next to nothing 
at first hand of Parker's work. We would like 
to suggest, in closing these remarks, that the 
new centennial edition of his collected writings 
consists largely of matter which is by no means 
outdated by the lapse of years, and which is still 
capable of serving as a fountain of inspiration 
for all generous souls. 



THE CENTENARY OF MUSSET* 



All the dreams of French Romanticism are re- 
called by the centenary of Alfred de Musset ; for the 
life of this poet might be said to typify the history 
of the Romantic School. Never did the genius of 
" Young France " come to such a sudden flowering 
as in 1830 ; and this spirit of youth Musset person- 
ifies in all its vivid brevity. A nervous, precociously 
brilliant boy, he recited his first verses, at seventeen, 
in the salon of Charles Nodier ; and the long-haired 
Romanticists petted and spoiled the youth, uncon- 
scious that he was to become their enfant terrible. 
Famous at twenty, Musset lived the life of a dandy, 
dividing his time between society, his cafe", and the 
writing of Byronic verses. A gay young Epicurean, 
he remained heart-whole and fancy-free until he 
met George Sand, in his twenty-second year. How 
he fell in love with that passionate Egeria, eight 
years his senior, and how his fickle muse betrayed 
and abandoned him within the year, everyone knows 
in this age of literary gossip ; and everyone knows 
how this catastrophe gave usMusset's greatest poems, 
written in anguish and blotted with his tears. The 
permanent effects of this experience upon the poet's 
character have been variously estimated, some critics 
entirely absolving George Sand from blame ; but 
however that may be, it is true that Musset never 
outgrew his disillusionment. A victim of Romantic 
ideals, we find him, at thirty, exhausted in mind and 
shipwrecked in morals, yet destined none the less to 
drag his genius for sixteen years through Paris gut- 
ters, until the curtain fell upon the sordid tragedy. 

It is not an edifying story, especially in its piti- 
ful ending. A veritable spoiled child, as M. Faguet 
calls him, Alfred de Musset remained a spoiled child 
to the end of his days. To a nature such as his, life 
itself could teach little or nothing. A voluptuary 
as well as a dreamer, all that he got out of his 
search after happiness was a philosophy of disillu- 
sion; and his was a despair which lacked the force 
to take refuge in the objective world. He could not 
cry with Candide, " II faut cultiver notre jardin." 
And so we feel that one thing was lacking to his 
destiny the early death which consecrates a poet 
as dear to the gods. Why was he not taken away 
at thirty, to join the immortal company of Chatter- 
ton, Keats, and Shelley? Alas for Musset, in his 
later years his poetic muse had all but left him, and 
the muse of debauch rarely beguiled his pen. 

In a life begun under such brilliant auspices, one 
cannot but regret so sordid an ending. Yet for all 
this, for all that he died at forty-six, Alfred de 
Musset takes his place in the history of French 
literature as the poet of Youth. It wells up in his 
early plays and verses like the sap of April, youth 
in all its exuberance, effervescent with energy, over- 
flowing with the restless fancies of an awakened 
imagination and a quenchless curiosity. " One must 
love many things in life," cries the poet, uncon-

[Nor, 16, 



sciously paraphrasing the Italian street-song trans- 
lated by Rossetti 

"II faut dans oe bM monde aimer beaucoup de choaea, 
Pour savoir, aprea tout, ee qu'on aime le inieux ; 
Lea bonbons, 1'Ocean, le jeu, 1'axur de* cieux, 
Le* femmea, lea chevaux, lea lanriers et lea roaea." 

All of youth's thirst for experience burns in the 
early work of Alfred de Mussel. All of youth's 
changing moods are there sentiment, passion, and 
revolt; and, playing over all, the prankish humor 
of a young faun. Even opposite* find place in its 
variety of moods, for in that first volume are 
revealed a lighter hearted Don Juan and a lesser 
Lamartine. " En litterature on est toujours fils de 
quelqu'un "; and Byron, we must remember, lay 
beside Shakespeare and Schiller on the table de 
rut it of the French Romanticists. Mussel, however, 
never consciously imitated anyone; indeed, he did 
not need to. There were so many themes to weave 
into plays or poems : love and life, and all the emo- 
tions of youth. There were so many moods, so many 
measures; and his lute knew them all in turn. All 
the wit and mischief of the Paris gamin bubble 
up in the " Ballade a la Lune "; all the fervor 
of a boy's revolt against convention overflows in 
"Mardoche" and "Les Marrons du feu." There 
is melancholy, too, in some of his verses; but we 
need not take it very seriously. " It is so pleasant 
to think oneself unhappy," says Musset in his auto- 
biographical novel, -when one is only empty and 
bored." Lamartine, of course, had made pessimism 
fashionable, and no one could escape it in 1830 ; 
but if our young poet yielded a moment to its spell, 
his real attitude may be seen in his hero Rafael, 
who has rejected melancholy and u given his life to 
the lazy god of Fancy." In fact, Don Rafael is no 
other than his creator Musset, in all the pride and 
spirit of his twentieth year. 

Of course, all of these early poems deal with love. 
Inexperienced as yet, Musset already reveals his 
temperament; through all the objectless passion 
of these verses we see the disillusionment that must 
come. At twenty-two, his knowledge of love is 
mainly literary; and if we turn for its sources to 
his favorite books, we shall find that they were the 
Decameron and " Manon Lescaut," the novels of 
Cn'billon and Louvet de Couvray. Such, alas, was 
Mussel's early reading ; and this is why our poet's 
ideal of love, as it appears throughout his plays 
and poems, reveals itself as a curious mixture of 
Romantic aspiration and the pagan spirit of the 
Regency or of the Renaissance. "An Italian of 
the Renaissance," M. Se'che' calls him; and the 
frontispiece of Mme. Barine's biography represents 
the young poet in the costume of an Italian page. 
Let us retain this phrase, admirably borne out as it 
is by Mussel's preference for Italian subjects in his 
plays ; for it becomes pregnant with meaning when 
we consider all that this pagan spirit brought him 
later, in Dead-Sea fruit. At twenty-two, however, 
we have only a boy's vague craving for passion, and 
the love of love as he imagined it as every poet 



had imagined it, one might say, since J. J. Rousseau 
and Chateaubriand. The young Musset is all eager- 
ness to live, to strip the tree of knowledge with 
both hands. He would have liked to be Don Juan, 
as he says in his " Namouna "; and indeed lie was 
himself his very hero Don Juan haunted through 
all his loves by an unattainable ideal. 

Such is the Musset " before George Sand." The 
Musset that came after is a more tragic figure, and 
the love he sings, in the splendid " Nuila " that 
voice his passion and his despair, is now a terrible 
reality. No wilful fancy of a sensuous imagination 
is this, but love in the presence, burning with all 
the passionate regret of a wrecked hope and a shat- 
tered ideal. In " Souvenir " we have a calmer 
mood, love in its regret for a past idealized by time 
and in the matchless stanzas to la Malibran, love 
thrilled with the tragedy of death and ihe longing 
for an immortal life. In an earlhlier sense Musset 
might have said with Dante : 

" Io mi ton un che, quando 
Amor mi apira, ooto, I a quel modo 
Che ddtta dentro, vo significando." 

His is no divine Beatrice, certainly ; yet none the 
less, in many lines of his best poems he did at least 
catch a glimpse of 

" L'Amor ohe maove il sole e 1'altre atelle." 
We have here the significance of Alfred de Mussel 
in the poetry of France. No other poet so exalts 
love into a religion. No other poet believes in it so 
absolutely, or celebrates the necessity of belief in 
such an endless hymn. Let us quote his credo, as 
we find it in " La Nuit d'AoOt": 

" Puiaqae, jusqu'aux roc hers tout se change en pouasiere ; 
Puisque tout raeurt ce soir pour revivre demain ; 
Puisque c'eat un engrais que le meurtre et la guerre 
Pniaque sur une torn be on voit sortir de terre 
Le brin d'herbe sacree qni nous donne le pain ; 

" O mnae ! qne m'imporfe on la mort on la vie ? 
J'aime, et je veux pfilir; j'aime et je veux souffrir; 
J'ainie, et pour un baiser je donne mon genie ; 
J'aime, et je veux sentir sur ma joue amaigrie 
Ruisaeler une source impossible a tarir. 

" J'aime, et je veux chanter la joie et la pareaae, 
Ma folle experience et mes soucis d'un jour, 
Et je veux raconter et re'pe'ter sans oomo 
Qu'aprea avoir jure" de vivre sans maltreats 
J'ai fait sentient de vivre et de mourir d'amour. 

" De'ponille devant tous 1'orgueil qni te de'vore, 
Cu?ur gonfle" d'amertume et qui t'ea cru ferine" ; 
Aime et tu renaitraa ; faia-toi fleur pour 4clore, 
Aprea avoir aouffert, il faut souffrir encore, 
II faut aimer sans oeaae, aprea avoir aim*'." 

For the Anglo-Saxon, with his virile conception 
of life, there is a moral weakness implied in this 
idolatry of emotion ; it is especially evident in the 
second stanza. But we are not dealing here with 
Musset as a moral creature, but as a poet ; and the 
most severe of critics cannot deny that in this un- 
divided worship lay material for splendid flight* of 
impassioned lyricism. His religion of love made 
MdSM-t as ;i port, it made him a* a playwright ami 
a novelist ; and his life-long devotion to this ideal 
gave us a volume which in the range and depth of

its passion might almost be called the breviary of 
love. The very perfume of departed youth breathes 
from the pages of these plays and poems, and the 
odor of spring-time clings to them like the scent of 
April violets. Some would object that they are hot- 
house violets, but surely that does not alter their 
color or spoil their delicate perfume. 

Well ! we can see now why Musset was the idol 
of his contemporaries ; we can understand why his 
admirers once outnumbered Victor Hugo's. We 
realize why his comedies and dramatic proverbs, in 
which he catches a breath of the true Shakespearian 
fancy, still hold their own upon the boards of the 
Come"die Franeaise. "It is not enough to be ad- 
mired," he says in one of his poems, " one must be 
loved too." Alfred de Musset was both admired 
and loved. " The favorite poet of France," as 
Taine called him years ago, his popularity, tempor- 
arily obscured by the symbolists and the Banville 
school, lies safe in the hearts of the older genera- 
tion. No permanent eclipse can fall upon this 
singer of youth. No change of literary fashion can 
overthrow a poet who, dandy of letters as he was, 
never wrote a line save in absolute sincerity to his 
mood. We wonder so often, when reading Victor 
Hugo, whether his finest flights are not merely feats 
of rhetorical maestria. Not so with Musset. His 
vision of the poet is the pelican tearing out its heart 
to feed its young ; this is his secret of truth in art : 

" Ah ! f rappe-toi le cceur, c'est la qu'est le ge'nie, 
C'est Ih qu'est la pitie", la souffrance et 1'amour.'' 

This advice to a fellow-poet was written in 1832, 
several months before Musset met George Sand. 
How much Musset owed to Sand, how much his art 
gained from the woman who made him suffer, has 
long been dinned into our ears; Mme. Sand's 
admirers have even said that she taught his pen 
sincerity and truth. To us, perhaps, the fact might 
seem probable; the mad irony and licence of his 
earlier poems ring false to Anglo-Saxon ears. We 
prefer the sweet seriousness of the English muses; 
and Byron, that great nonconformist, has always 
been more popular on the Continent than in America 
or at home. But Frenchmen are not Anglo-Saxons, 
and few Frenchmen would admit that the use of 
irony evinces insincerity, or indicates aught but the 
expression of an ironical mood. No! wanton as 
she is, Musset's early muse is the poet's very self; 
all that suffering did for him later was to absorb 
him into a great experience, absorb him so fully 
that the sprites of wit and irony were for the time 
forgotten. For the born ironist, sorrow is the ulti- 
mate reality ; and sorrow alone, by taking from him 
the power of self-detachment, can give his art unity 
of emotional effect. 

So much, at least, George Sand did for Alfred 
de Musset. She made him suffer, and the world is 
the gainer by a few splendid lyrics. But the price 
he paid for their perfection! That high lyrical 
note, of course, could not last; it perished with 
the "Nuits," with the verses to Lamartine and to 



la Malibran, and with " Souvenir." And the poet, 
unable to readjust himself td reality, fell back into 
irony in his later verses, an irony deepened by 
disappointed hopes, the residuum of disillusion and 
departed dreams. 

It is a very human story after all, and the note 
of bitter experience that runs through Musset's 
plays and verse touches us, almost in spite of our- 
selves, with a sense of pity and regret for a talent 
thrown away. We have all dreamed of a fairer 
life than this is ; we have all given voice to Musset's 
cry : 

" Ah ! si la reverie e"tait toujours possible ! 
Et si le sonnambule, en e*tendant la main, 
Ne trouvait pas toujours la nature inflexible 
Qui lui heurte le front centre un pilier d'airain." 

We have all bruised our foreheads against the pil- 
lars of bronze ; and most of us have learned to ac- 
cept the facts of life into our philosophy. Alfred de 
Musset never did. Till the end of his days he kept 
clutching at the soap-bubbles of illusion, never 
daunted by the drops of water he received in his 
eager eyes. He was predestined to suffer, to suffer 
and to succumb. Moreover, his impressionability 
made him the plaything of life. His acces de nerfs 
in his boyhood, of which we read in Barine, would 
be enough to explain his nature, did we need evid- 
ence to convince us of his physical unfitness for a 
life of self-control. For Musset's final shipwreck, 
like Poe's, is implied in his character. It lies 
revealed in the mad objectless passion of his early 
verses, through which the lust of life in all its ful- 
ness already burns ; the wood that feeds it still 
green, but sending up even then such a feverish 
flame ! He was, in fine, a Romantic epicurean ; and 
an epicurean to whom even pain was preferable to 
the tedium of stilled emotions. And if anything 
more were needed to exhibit this hedonism, solely 
concerned with getting every emotion out of youth 
while it lasted donee virenti canities abest we 
may surely find it in the verses "A une Morte," 
whose melody leads so wonderfully up to the almost 
intolerable pathos of the final chord : 

" Elle est morte et n'a point ve'cu. 
Elle faisait semblant de vivre. 
De son main est tombe" le livre 
Dans lequel elle n'a rien lu." 

The obverse of the picture has the added pathos 
of reality. When Musset wrote these lines, he had 
lived, and his genius was all but dead. His book 
" le livre du cceur," as he called it, was all too soon 
read through, read and re-read until all meaning 
had faded from the words. He had realized, by 
this time, that one cannot re-live an impression ; that 
the emotions wear away in successive experiences, 
as a gold coin loses the freshness of its imprint and 
its first soft bloom. " Everything passes away like 
smoke," he cries, " everything except ennui." His 
heart is now "a solitude," "a tomb"; his brain 
" an empty fire-place filled with ashes." He envies 
Nodier, thirty years older than himself, the eternal 
youth which bubbles up in his " Stances" verses

thought that " happy memories are, perhaps, more 
real than happiness itself."

de Mussel was ready. Tired and disillusioned,

CASUAL COMMENT. 



TOT ELEVEN NEW ADMISSIONS TO THE HALL OF 

FAME show noteworthy and commendable selections. 
Ninety-seven ballots were cast, and fifty-one votes 
were required for election. New England is largely 
represented, and two women are among the eleven 
elect The list is as follows, with the number of 
votes cast for each name: Harriet Beecher Stowe, 
74; Oliver Wendell Holmes, 69; Edgar Allan Poe, 
69; Roger Williams, 64; James Fenimore Cooper, 
62; Phillips Brooks, 60; William Ciillen Bryant, 
59 ; Frances E. Willard, 56 ; Andrew Jackson, 53 ; 
George Bancroft, 53 ; John Lothrop Motley, 51. 
At last Poe comes in by a handsome majority, and 
Holmes gains twenty votes over the number cast for 
him five years ago such is the beneficial effect of 
his recent centenary. Mrs. Stowe receives a vote 
surpassed by only fifteen previous names. Eleven 
bronze tablets for the eleven new names will be 
designed, each bearing a fitting sentiment from the 
pen or lips of the person it commemorates, and the 
formal unveiling is expected to take place in October 
of next year. Among the almost-elected candidates 
at this latest balloting occur the names of Parkman, 
Samuel Adams, Mark Hopkins, Charlotte Cushman, 
and Lucretia Mott. . 

THE CLASSICS IN THE SLUMS might be thought 
unlikely to find readers, but they find what is even 
more astonishing buyers; and as the books are 
bought chiefly in unornamental editions, it must be 
for purposes of reading rather than display. These 
buyers, however, are not of our own Anglo-Saxon 
stock. One must go among the organ-grinding, 
fruit-selling, peanut-vending population of our larger 
cities to find these purchasers of Dante and Petrarch 
and Tasso, of Goldoni and Man/oni and Silvio 
Pellico, as also (in Italian versions) of Shakespeare, 
Voltaire, Virgil, Plautus. Macaulay, Dickens, Cooper, 
and many others. Side by side with macaroni and 
cigars and cheap jewelry, many a little shop in the 
Italian quarter maintains its stock of standard 
authors, often in ten-cent paper editions, but not 
infrequently in more pretentious and more durable 
form. " La Casa Trista " of Dickens and " II Corsaro 
Rosso " of Cooper, with Sheridan's " La Scuola della 
Maldicenza," and some of Hawthorne's stories col- 
lected under the title " Racconti di Far-West," com- 
pete with native Italian literature for Giovanni's 
and Jacopo's and Pietro's hard-earned pennies. As 



long as these poor children of sunny Italy manifest 
their spontaneous love of good reading by buying it, 
and of good pictures and statuary by thronging our 
art museums on Sundays and holidays, and of good 
music by packing the galleries of our opera houses 
on Italian-opera nights, what more hopeful class of 
immigrants could we desire to leaven the lump of 
our materialism and our stolid content with worldly 
prosperity? . . . 

LIBRARY SCIENCE AND BIBLIOGRAPHY IN ITALY 
appear to be in a sad state of neglect. In view of 
the coming exposition at Turin and the proposed 
exhibition of books in connection with it, the Italian 
government appointed a commission to visit the 
various national libraries of the country and make 
selections for what is likely to be an exceptionally 
fine display of rare and beautiful volumes. This 
quest has revealed an astonishing state of neglect 
and incompetence in the management of some of 
these libraries. It is reported of the Vittorio 
Emanuele Library in Rome that its staff is largely 
composed of lackadaisical directors, harmless luna- 
tics, chronic invalids, incapacitated octogenarians, 
and women of hopelessly idiosyncratic peculiarities. 
Disregard of library hours and library duties is the 
rule and not the exception. One assistant librarian 
has been absent from his post for eight months, 
another seems to have settled permanently in Cairo, 
and a third is resting from his labors behind iron 
bars, being in prison on a sentence for burglary. 
Wholesale mutilation of valuable works, singly and 
in sets, is reported. In short, Italian libraries might 
fairly be conceived of as on the rapid road to ruin ; 
but it may be that the instances of mismanagement 
and neglect pointed out by the commission are ex- 
ceptional, not the rule. Let us hope so. Complaint 
is also made of the incapacity of the editorial staff 
appointed by the government to prepare a number 
of costly reproductions of historical works at the 
expense of the Ministry of Public Instruction. To 
these editors Duns Scotus is so entirely unknown 
that his works, as found in the library at Subiaco, 
are described in two separate sections of a book on 
the monasteries of Subiaco, as the writings of a 
Signor Scotus and again as those of a Signor Duma. 
And yet it was Italy that gave to the world, or more 
especially to the British Museum, an Antonio 
Panizzi, of honored memory. 


FREAKS OF LITERARY CENSORSHIP are often 
amusing to the dispassionate observer, while not 
infrequently maddening to those more closely con- 
cerned with the censored wares. In a certain town 
not a million miles from Plymouth Rock, the open 
sale of Boccaccio, even in the original Italian, is 
discouraged if not forbidden, while the vending of 
Chaucer, complete and unexpurgated, in the not 
very obscure English of his day, no one dreams of 
protesting against. From across the water we hear 
that Mr. Laurence Housman. author of "An English- 
woman's Love- Letters," has been annoyed by the

censor's rejection of his recent play, " Pains and 
Penalties," but that his anonymous version, or 
adaptation, of Aristophanes's " Lysistrata " went 
through without demur, although certain plain- 
spoken passages excited public comment even after 
they had been toned down by the management from 
that unmitigated Aristophanic frankness of expres- 
sion which the censor had allowed to pass. An 
ancient name will cover a multitude of sins. In 
how many Puritan families has the Bible been peri- 
odically and conscientiously read through from cover 
to cover, while anything branded with the name of 
a novel, even a Waverley novel, and any work 
written for the stage, even a play of Shakespeare, 
have been banished from the house with pious 
shudders ! ... 

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF A YANKEE PRINTER, who 

was among the last surviving " forty-niners," and 
had in maturer life become a Methodist minister, 
strikes a reader of his obituary as probably unique. 
Taking a supply of type with him when he embarked 
for San Francisco in March, 1849, Linville J. Hall, 
printer by trade, and resident of Hartford, Conn., 
wrote, set up, and printed during the seven-months 
voyage a book of eighty-eight close-lined pages 
entitled " Around the Horn in '49 : Journal of the 
Hartford Mining and Trading Company." Nearly 
two hundred copies were struck off on the rude 
press he himself made on shipboard, and if anyone 
of them is still in existence it would be a treasure 
to its finder. A much later issue, with eighty pages 
of additional matter on " Mines and Miners in '49 
and '50," was produced by occupants at the State 
Prison at Canon City, Colorado, where Mr. Hall 
was for some years chaplain, and where he taught 
a number of his convict congregation the art of 
printing. He has recently died at the ripe age of 
eighty-eight, in Springfield, Mass., after a richly 
varied experience of life in sundry parts of the 
western hemisphere. His biography would make a 
book well worth reading, if we could only have it 
fully and faithfully presented.

sub-section, " Automobiles," are entered such items 
as this : " Corte Madera, near, car overturns, Miss 
Florence Pardee killed, S 11." Then follows, 
"Eureka, near, cars collide, Alexander Peterson 
killed, Ag. 7." (For the benefit of non-graduates 
of library schools let it be explained that "S 11" 
means Sept. 11, and "Ag. 7" means Aug. 7.) 
Further down we find, under "Prize Fights," 
" Johnson defeats Jeffries, Jl. 4." Under " Librar-

devoted to brief accounts of California libraries, 
entered alphabetically by place-name, with notes of 
recent changes or events of importance, and to the 
various activities of the California State Library 
and the California Library Association.

THE ARRESTED FLIGHT OF A SONNETEER an 

arrested flight in two senses of the term will 
make literature poorer than it might have been had 
the poet been allowed to fly. M. Edmond Rostand, 
after being moved to metrical utterance by the not 
yet commonplace spectacle of an aeroplane cleaving 
its way through the clouds, conceived the sublime 
idea of a sonnet, or perhaps of a longer poem, writ- 
ten in a flying-machine in full career. But Madame 
Rostand said emphatically, No, never or, at least, 
not until flying is as safe as walking. But when 
that stage of aeronautics is reached will it have 
power to thrill the aerial passenger and prompt him 
to sing? If flying had always been safe and easy to 
wingless bipeds, we should most certainly never have 
had any " Darius Green " (which by the way, after 
making a decided hit almost half a century ago, is 
now making another hit in a special edition with 
mirth-provoking illustrations by Mr. Wallace Gold- 
smith). There is, however, more than a possibility, 
in view of recent occurrences at Belmont, that the 
French poet, after dipping his pen in the azure of 
the heavens and hymning the ecstatic praises of 
aviation, might never have composed another line. 
It might, in short, have been his swan-song, and he 
might have learned with Darius that while flying is 
all well enough, " the' ain 't sich a thunderin' sight 
o' fun in 't when ye come to 'light." 

COUNT TOLSTOY'S LATEST LITERARY WORK, a 
pamphlet entitled "Three Days in a Village," re- 
counting simply and realistically the incidents of 
three days spent in a village near the writer's home, 
has evidently been found by the Russian government 
to contain too much truth to be edifying reading; 
and accordingly the seizure of all copies has been 
ordered. The sub-titles prefixed to the three suc- 
cessive parts of the little narrative ("Wayfaring 
Men," " Living and Dying," and " Taxes ") lead 
one to surmise that something of the heart-breaking 
misery and hopelessness of Russian peasant life has 
been presented to the reader; and it is also said 
that the author has not refrained from a closing 
arraignment of the ruling powers that are responsible 
for all this wretchedness and injustice. It is safe to 
conclude that the doughty author, against whom 
even the despot's hand is stayed, has delivered him- 
self of a weighty and a telling word, which, in spite 
of censors, will be heard around the world.

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



nent French litterateur, complains, in the Revue 
des Deux Monde*, of a deplorable deterioration in 
French prose writing. Good writing, he well main- 
tains, is largely a question of intellectual fibre; and 
there is much in modern educational methods, with 
their multiplicity of electives, including an increas- 
ing number of ''soft" ones, to produce flabbiness 
of intellectual fibre. Courses in the study and 
writing of English have multiplied, it is true; but 
the first requisite to good writing is sound and 
vigorous thinking. The student who has thoroughly 
mastered Thucydides in the original, for example, 
and has steeped bis mind in the English of the 
King James version of the Bible, is far more likely 
to write tersely and idiomatically than is the one 
who has taken courses in modern European fiction 
and written innumerable themes. But after all is 
said, in order to write well one must first have 
something to say; and the old saying still holds, 
that the style is the man. A person with no orig- 
inal ideas and no toughness of fibre is sure to be 

characterless and weak in his writing. 



A CHILLY COMMENT ON COMMANDER PEARY'S 

BOOK comes from Professor Andreas Galle, chief 
of the Geodetic Institute at Berlin. In the hardy 
explorer's account of his Arctic achievement, the 
German scientist professes to find no convincing 
evidence that the Pole was really reached by him ; 
in short, he declares that Commander Peary's 
claim rests upon no valid scientific proof whatever. 
Probably the Herr Professor, if strictly catechized 
on the subject, would be forced to own that he had 
never received any valid scientific proof of the 
existence of such a city as Chicago. The only 
validly scientific way to discover the North Pole 
would be for two or more geographic or geodetic 
societies to proceed thither in company, each keep- 
ing - tab " on the others, and all uniting in signing 
a sworn statement that the protuberant end of the 
earth's axis had actually been seen and handled by 
them severally and collectively. And then if a splin- 
ter were brought back in addition, perhaps even the 
Berlin professor of geodetics would be convinced. 


THE DISPOSAL OF THE LIBRARY AT STORMFIELD,

ated by his hand will fall a prey to the highest

region was favored by many for the 1910 meeting ; 
and as the Southwest has never had the conference 
in all the thirty-four years of the Association's 
existence, it is none too soon to give it the benefit 
and the stimulus of this annual congress of library 
workers. San Francisco was the meeting-place in 
1891, and Portland, Oregon, in 1905, these being 
the only occasions on which the Pacific coast has 
entertained the A. L. A. With its one hundred and 
twenty public libraries (without counting school. 
university, and other serai-public libraries ), and its 
four hundred or more library workers, only fifty- 
one of whom are at present enrolled as members of 
the A. L. A., California should profit greatly by the 
proposed conference within its borders, and should 
also benefit the Association by a generous infusion 
of new blood in the form of added membership. 


THE LATEST THING IN CRYPTOGRAMS comes from 
an ingenious Englishman, Sir Edward Durning- 
Lawrence, who has written a book with the em- 
phatically unambiguous title, Bacon is Shake- 
speare." It is a rather magnificent effort in a 
dubious cause, and especially admirable is the bril- 
liant discovery of a hitherto unsuspected anagram 
in that sonorous pseudo-Latin word put into the 
mouth (it must have been a large one) of the clown 
in " Love's Labour's Lost " honorificabilitudini- 
tatibus. By a clever re-arrangement of the letters 
of this word, Sir Edward achieves the following bad 
hexameter : 

Hi ludi F. Baconis nati tuiti orbi, 

which may be translated, These plays, offspring of 
F. Bacon, are preserved for the world. We think 
the Baconians might well rest their case here ; hu- 
man or inhuman ingenuity can hardly further go.

but in these latter days, when university degrees are 
as thick as blackberries and of yearly increasing 
variety, the winning of one can hardly be considered 
a very startling achievement At the University of 
Pennsylvania there is started this year a new course, 
known as the Public Health course, and designed to 
train its students to serve as public health officers 
having adequate knowledge of sanitary engineering, 
public water supply, the inspection of meat and 
milk, and a variety of similar useful accomplish-

its limits, leads to the degree of P. H. I).

THE "RETURN TO MACAULAY." 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

The discussion of a " return to Macaulay " moves ine 
to add a word upon the subject. In my opinion the time 
is not yet ripe for the type of history for which Profes- 
sor Hutson pines. The older histories of this class were 
either based upon highly colored partisan contemporary 
accounts or upon some theory as to what the facts were. 
It is impossible for any writer covering a large field or 
a long period to investigate fully the basis for the 
thousands of statements that his book must contain. 
Speaking for American history alone, there is scarcely 
a topic respecting which there are not important questions 
which have not yet been answered. How important 
these questions are cannot be known until the facts are 
ascertained. The most conspicuous example is the 
American Revolution. In hardly more than a single 
colony has the movement been traced in detail. Not 
until this has been done for all the colonies will any 
adequate presentation of the movement as a whole be 
practicable. The type of mind required for this detailed 
investigation is altogether different from that needed 
for painting the larger picture. When the detailed 
work is fairly complete, the man will come, who, with 
clear insight, a broad grasp, and a brilliant literary 
style, will combine the monographic results of his prede- 
cessors into a well balanced whole, which, to the inter- 
est of Macaulay, will add the advantage of being ap- 
proximately true. Therefore I would counsel continued 
work along present lines, and patience.

TILL EULENSPIEGEL ON AVIATION. 

(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

We have been reading of wonderful flying experiences 
in St. Louis, Darmstadt, and elsewhere, and our own 
old city of Magdeburg has just been the scene of a 
three days' national aeroplane contest. It is curious 
that two miles of street-car track bind together the 
great race-course where the German aviators strove 
with very modest success, it is true, not to mention the 
terrible death of Lieutenant Menthe to match the 
records of their hereditary enemies across the Rhine, 
and the old Town-House where the classic joker Till 
Eulenspiegel is said to have advertised one of the first 
flights on record. The story is Number XIIII. in 
"The Book of Till Eulenspiegel"; but I translate 
from the somewhat more intelligible modernized ad- 
aptation contained in "Tales of the City of Magdeburg," 
by Fr. Hiilsse (Albert Rathke, Magdeburg) : 

" Till Eulenspiegel came once also to the town of Magde- 
burg, to play here many a fool-caper. One day he gave notice 
that he would fly from the gable of the Town-House and 
down to the Market. [This gable was so arranged that 
officials mounted to a platform and read notices of public 
importance from that commanding position. TB.] When 
the news spread in the city, a great number of people, young 
and old, streamed together to the market-place. All were 
eager to see the far-famed fool fly. Eulenspiegel stood 
upright on the wall, and moved his arms and hands, just as if 
he would begin to fly. The folk opened eye and mouth wide 
in sheer astonishment, and thought to see him in the air the 
next moment. But Eulenspiegel laughed and said, ' I 
thought there were no fools or simpletons in the world but I. 
Now I see well that here almost the whole town is full of 
fools. For if all of you had said that you could fly I should 



not have believed it. You believe me, although I am a fool. 
1 am, as you know, neither a goose nor any other sort of bird ; 
moreover, I have neither wings nor feathers, without which 
no one can fly. So you can see clearly that I told you a lie.' 
Therewith he ran from the gable and left the folk standing, 
of whom some fled, but some laughed and said, ' Great rascal 
as he is, he has nevertheless spoken the truth.' " 

Far be it from the translator to institute comparisons 
or make a prophet of the cheerful philosopher. He 
merely finds it curious that the two events occurred so 
near together. ROY TEMPLE HOUSE.

A FOOT-NOTE TO " VANITY FAIR." 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

Every lover of Thackeray that is to say, every one 
with a soul worth saving will recall the chapter in 
" Vanity Fair " of which the climax is reached in the 
quarrel between George Osborne and his father. Prior 
to this scene, Miss Swartz and the Misses Osborne had 
a little music in the drawing-room, and the sisters 
began the entertainment with " The Battle of Prague." 

" ' Stop that d thing, ' George howled out in a fury from 
the sofa. ' It makes me mad. You play something, Miss 
Swartz , do. Sing something, anything but the Battle of 
Prague.' 

" ' Shall I sing Blue-Eyed Mary or the air from the Ca- 
binet? ' Miss Swartz asked. 

" ' That sweet thing from the Cabinet,' the sisters said. 

" ' We've had that,' replied the misanthrope on the sofa. 

" ' I can sing Fluvy du Tajy,' Swartz said in a meek voice, 
' if I had the words.' It was the last of the worthy young 
woman's collection. 

'"0, Fleuve du Tage,' Miss Maria cried ; ' we have the 
song,' and went to find the book in which it was. 

" Now it happened that this song, then in the height of 
fashion, had been given " 

And then the name of Amelia Sedley on the title-page 
of the album ushered in the fatal dispute. 

It has been many a long year since I first read those 
lines, and began to wonder why " The Battle of Prague" 
so incensed the easily-incensed cap tain, and what manner 
of song was the " Fleuve du Tage " with which . i 
dark heiress calmed his wrath. Nobody to whom 1 
put the question knew, and I came at last to believe 
that, since nobody was left alive who remembered the 
fashionable music of the -year ' 15, I must needs live 
my life out in ignorance thereof. Finally a very old 
lady recalled the " Battle " as a " very noisy piece; not 
at all pretty " ; and from an old handbook of " Things to 
Know " I learned that it was written by Franz Kotz- 
wara, who was born in the city which he thus celebrated, 
in 1791. It is possible, therefore, but not probable, that 
Thackeray was correct in fancying that Miss Maria and 
Miss Jane favoured their dinner guests with his com- 
position, in the spring before Waterloo. 

And now the death of another old lady, and the subse- 
quent sale of her books, has put me in possession of 
some bound volumes of " Godey's Lady's Book," and in 
the number for March, 1858, behold ! the song which 
Amelia loved " Fleuve du Tage," " written and com- 
posed for the piano forte for Godey's Lady's Book," by 
J. Starr Hollway. The pretty plaintive air, and the 
delicate accompaniment, suggestive of softly-flowing 
water, are quite suited to the verses. No one can doubt 
that dear Amelia would have adored the song. But, 
oh ! by what juggling with the calendar can we be sure 
that she ever heard it ! SARA ANDREW SHAFER.

MODJESKA IN POLAND AND AMERICA.* 

Even those of us who are only fortunate 
enough to have seen Madame Modjeska in later 
life can readily understand the enthusiasm 
evoked by her beauty, her charm, and her genius 
when, hardly more than a girl, she made her 
first appearance as Juliet in her native Cracow 
and received a veritable storm of applause, being 
ten times called before the curtain at the end. 
She had never witnessed a performance of the 
play, and had not even read it before taking up 
the study of her part. Her first appearance on 
the American stage, at San Francisco in 1877, 
which was also her first trial of the English 
language before an audience, was equally suc- 
cessful. Her " Adrienne Lecouvreur" was ap- 
plauded furiously. 

In a substantial volume of nearly six hundred 
pages, entitled " Memories and Impressions of 
Helena Modjeska," the great actress, who died 
last year at her California home before quite 
reaching the scriptural three-score-and-ten, tells 
her life-story with a most engaging frankness 
and completeness, and in English surprisingly 
pure and flexible, with such a command of its 
idioms as to betray hardly a trace of the for- 
eigner, although she was nearer forty than thirty 
when she began the serious study of our tongue. 
From her birth in 1840 to her retirement from 
the stage in 1907 the varied and eventful course 
of her life forms a narrative none too long. The 
many reminiscences of European and American 
celebrities, members of her own profession or 
otherwise noteworthy, diversify the story, while 
its abundance of portraits and views still further 
enliven it. 

Cracow was the birthplace of Helena Opid, 
and as she was one of ten children and was left 
fatherless at seven years of age, her early seek- 
ing of employment on the stage can be readily 
accounted for. Her passion for the drama, as 
well as her elocutionary and musical gifts, must 
have been derived from that ill-fated father, 
who delighted in telling stories and reciting 
poetry to his children, and who played several 
musical instruments, music being his passion, 
as we are told. The following scene, depicted 
by the daughter in her opening chapter, is pro- 
phetic of her own subsequent development : 

I remember him during long winter evenings, sit-

ting by the fireside, holding me and my sister on his 
knees; near him my mother knitting, and the boys, 
together with neighbors' children, scattered on the floor, 
watching him with glistening, curious eyes, and listening 
attentively to his stories. They were wonderful stories 
that touched us with pity or thrilled us with joy. Some 
of them were taken from national legends or from the 
mountaineer folk-lore, some were his own invention, or 
subjects taken from his cherished books. His favorite 
story was Homer's ' Iliad,' extracts of which be told 
us in his simple language. I do not know how much I 
understood then of the famous epic poem, but when I 
read it some fifteen years later, many famous scenes 
came back vividly to my mind, and the picture of my 
father rose from the remote past, filling my eyes with 
tears." 

In the same vein is her recollection of the later 
evening readings in the family circle, when 
every one had to take turns, and while my 
mother and Aunt Teresa were knitting, and we 
children were dressing or stitching clothes for 
our dolls, one of my brothers, or anyone who 
would volunteer to do so, would read aloud. 
These were very delightful, never-to-be-forgotten 
evenings." Dramatic talent was not confined 
to Helena ; two elder brothers left home for the 
stage, and the younger children took naturally 
to private theatricals. About the year 1860, 
as far as can be determined from her narrative, 
which is pleasantly free from an excess of dates 
and unfettered by too strict adherence to chron- 
ological order, Helena Opid married her German 
teacher, Gustave Modrzejewski (or Modjeski, 
as she very kindly abbreviates and simplifies it 
for us), and thus became the Madame Modjeska 
of histrionic renown, although only eight years 
later she was wedded to her second husband, 
Count Karol Chlapowski. Thus, the hyper- 
accurate librarian will take notice, her book 
should be catalogued, not under " Modjeska '' 
or even " Modrzejewska," but under " Chla- 
powska." But in just what one of the several 
ways familiar to the dramatic profession Mr. 
Modjeski passed from the scene of action and 
lapsed into oblivion, is not revealed. He ceases 
to figure in the book ere one is a quarter of 
the way through. 

Among Madame Modjeska's early friends 
were the brilliantly gifted De Reszke family; 
Joseph Chelmonski, the painter ; Count Przezd- 
ziecki, the historian and archaeologist ; Felician 
Falenski, the poet ; Stanislaw Witkiewicz, the 
painter and author ; and Henryk Sienkiewicz, 
the novelist. Of the latter as he appeared in 
his younger days we read : 

' It was on a visit to their country home [i.e. the 
country home of some common friends J that we met 
Henryk Sienkiewicz, and that glorious young man came 
almost regularly to our reception- I < ; u set- him even

now, sitting in a cosy corner of the room, his handsome, 
expressive face leaning against his hand, silent, for he 
rarely spoke, but his brilliant, half-veiled eyes saw every- 
thing and his ears drank in every word. The whole room, 
with its contents, men, women, and objects, was uncon- 
sciously yielding food for his acute observation. He some- 
times outstayed the company, and when only a few of our 
intimate friends remained he took an active part in the 
conversation, to our great delight, for his many-sided 
intellect and slightly sarcastic humor acted like a stimu- 
lant upon others, calling forth most clever and interest- 
ing replies. I was usually a mute listener to the inter- 
course, which sometimes became so fascinating that our 
guests did not notice when the candles were burnt out 
and replaced by fresh ones, while the dim white light 
peeped across the window-blinds." 

It was this young man of genius who was the 
most enthusiastic supporter of Count Chlapow- 
ski's project of forming a community in Cali- 
fornia on the model of the one that had so flatly 
failed at Brook Farm. The migration was 
actually accomplished, Anaheim was settled, 
and the colony struggled on long enough to 
disembarrass its promoter of fifteen thousand 
dollars or more, when Madame Modjeska seems 
to have put a stop to the folly by going off to 
San Francisco to study English and resume her 
old profession. Her husband accompanied her, 
and at one time acted as her manager. 

To touch here more particularly on her life 
in America, as the most important or at least, 
to us, the most interesting part, we may note a 
few of her more intimate friendships in this 
country and some of her triumphs as an actress, 
together with an occasional opinion of hers on 
American actors and on the art of acting in 
general. Her first meeting with Longfellow is 
thus described : 

" One of the most important events of my stay in 
Boston was my meeting with Henry W. Longfellow. 
Mrs. Gilder wrote that the great man would call on me 
at my hotel. Although I was forewarned of his visit, 
yet 1 was quite overcome with emotion when one after- 
noon his card was brought to my room. One look of 
his kind, deep-set eyes and a warm hand-shake soon 
restored my mental equilibrium and put me at my ease. 
The presence of this true, great poet, this man endowed 
with the finest qualities a man can possess, was a spirit- 
ual feast for me. . . . Then my son Ralph came in, and 
we were both invited to lunch at the poet's house in 
Cambridge. Longfellow's great charm was just that 
perfect simplicity, so rare in celebrated men. There was 
not a shade of the patronizing air so frequently assumed 
by people of superior standing, not a particle of the 
pomposity I had observed more than once among much 
less-known writers. A celebrity without conceit is rare, 
but there was none in the author of " Evangeline " and 
' Hiawatha.' He did not seem to care much for com- 
pliments. ... I made another attempt, and said I would 
gladly study some passages from his poems and recite 
them to him, and I mentioned " Hiawatha," but he 
stopped me with the words : 'You do not want to waste 
your time in memorizing those things, and don't you 



speak of "Hiawatha," or I will call you Mudjikiewis, 
which, by the way, sounds somewhat like your name.' " 

Edwin Booth, with whom Modjeska played 
for a season, won her hearty liking as well as 
her admiration. She says of him : 

" My season with Edwin Booth was delightful. I 
found him one of the kindest and pleasaiitest men of 
the profession. He also possessed what I considered a 
great quality simplicity of manner. . . . 

"... I remember that at supper we spoke of Shake- 
speare, and then I had the opportunity of learning how 
deeply and thoroughly Booth studied his parts. He 
says he has no ear for music, but any mistake in blank 
verse jars upon him as a false note. Of course he 
puts a great stress upon pronunciation, emphasis, and 
inflections of the voice, and he kindly pointed out some 
of my mistakes in pronunciation, which I gratefully 
accepted, and tried to correct myself at the next per- 
formance. . . . He also said that my delivery of the 
' Mercy ' speech [in < The Merchant of Venice '] was 
' admirable.' I felt highly flattered and happy, of 
course. It seems that the reason why he has not studied 
any new parts for a long time is that, whenever he put 
a new play on the bills, the audience kept away from 
it and were asking for 'Hamlet,' 'Richelieu,' etc., 
plays which he has played for years. It is very strange 
that people should be so conservative in their taste, but 
it is certainly the case with Americans, and the older 
the play the better ' the draw.' " 

A few pages after this surprising charge 
against us of excessive fondness for the good 
old plays, the writer has something to say about 
contemporary American actors, calling atten- 
tion to certain defects in the present system of 
training. " The evil," she adds, " lies in the 
unfortunate ' star ' system. There is little op- 
portunity for beginners to learn much. They 
usually are shifted from one company to another, 
and often forced to play one single part all 
through the season. In most cases they are not 
allowed to present their own conception of the 
character, but are compelled to follow blindly 
the stage-manager's instructions." Touching 
later on the interpretation of Shakespeare's 
plays, and the common contention that in order 
to render them properly the actors should be 
of English stock, she argues convincingly that 
Shakespeare is too largely human, too universal 
in his appeal, to require players of only his own 
nationality to impersonate his characters. Of 
course she admits that in no foreign tongue can 
his plays be adequately presented ; and her fine 
mastery of the language of Shakespeare is a 
proof of the earnestness of her feeling in this 
respect. Near the end of her book she says a 
few well-considered words on dramatic art in 
general. The faithful interpretation of a part 
she considers something more than an art. 

" Something else is needed, something which ought 
to lie in the very depth of the actor's soul, the sugges-

tion of which has much more value than even the moat 
laborious study. I do not know well how to define this 
something, but it seems to me to be an irresponsible 
desire of expression, together with the riches of feeling, 
which one can open to the world. Those who are en- 
dowed with this sense of expression, and moreover can 
enhance it with the color of their imagination and the 
intensity of emotional temperament, achieve what a 
mechanical though excellent performer can never do. 
They thrill the audience, which will carry home some 
of the actor's inmost treasures and live on them for a 
while. The richer his nature, the better the influence. 
' The more I give, the more I have,' says Juliet. To 
give and to give is our task." 

Some of this is rather trite and obvious, it may 
be, but the whole passage of which it is a part 
is well worth reading. 

Madame Modjeska's autobiography, coming 
as it does so soon after Miss Ellen Terry's and 
Madame Sarah Bernhardt's and Clara Morris's 
published reminiscences, invites comparison with 
them, and will surely not suffer thereby. Some- 
thing of the pathos, the passion, the intensity, 
of her Polish blood shows itself in her writing, 
and imparts to her pages a vividness and a depth 
and richness of human feeling that enthrall the 
reader and carry him a willing captive to the 
end. No better book in its kind could be desired. 

The considerable additions to the narrative 
and to the illustrations, over and above what 
has already appeared serially, make the work 

really a new book.

A NEW THING IN HISTORICAL WRITING.* 



There is a poem of Leigh Hunt's whose 
legend runs thus : For many years the dwellers 
at the foot of the Himalayas had been subjected 
to incursions from the hill-people above. These 
latter descended through a mighty pass whose en- 
trance overhung the lowlands. At last, however, 
actual invasions ceased ; but up out of the heart 
of that gorge in the hills there came ever down 
to the affrighted ears of those below the sound 
of the mustering and trampling and tumult of a 
mighty armament. Trumpets blew and drums 
sounded ; arms clashed and cheers echoed ; and 
in the hearts of the lowland hearers was a sub- 
jected awe, a panic always poised to fly. This 
went on for some time, but finally the noises 
grew fainter, the clarion calls died away, and 
the footsteps of a great army seemed to retreat. 
A few of the bolder of the folk below summoned 
up courage to climb into the pass and this in 
what met their eyes: Great tree-trunks had

been hollowed out and placed so that the winds 
of the gorge should blow through them. It 
was this which had simulated the noises of a 
tumultuous army. But Nature had defeated 
the scheme of man. Birds, birds in multitude, 
had crept into these hollowed pipes and built 
their nests; and as they gradually stopped 
those narrow chambers up, the martial music 
had gradually decreased. 

This poem comes back to the mind as one 
reads General Morris Schaff's book on "The 
Battle of the Wilderness." For more than a 
generation the histories of the Civil War have 
been filled with the thunder of great guns, the 
tramping of infantry, the clang of horsemen; 
filled, too, with the hatreds of both sides, and 
with the quarrels over the plunder of glory 
belonging to the various leaders. Now a poet 
makes his appearance, a poet with vision in 
his brain and charity and sympathy in his heart. 
Flowers bloom, birds sing, the woods are gay 
in May apparel ; we see the swinging march of 
men, we hear the ring of youthful voices. 
Stern war is turned to favor and romance. 
And hatreds and quarrels disappear. There 
is appreciation for the heroes of both camps, 
intimate pictures of their mien and bearing. 

This is indeed a new departure in historical 
writing, at least for American history. General 
Schaff has adopted something of epic methods. 
He has a " machinery " of his own a mythol- 
ogy of spirits and phantoms that come at will, 
predict events, and brood over battles. Under 
the definitely traced lines of his actual record 
there gleam faded traceries of fate and mystic 
meaning. It would have required but little more 
to have brought the Vates or Druids upon the 
scene. What fine imaginative gifts many of the 
soldiers of the Civil War have shown ! Pro- 
fessor Shaler rose to really great heights in his 
epic drama " Elizabeth of England," and now 
General Schaff displays a vividness of phantasy, 
with a concurrent grace and magic of style, that 
outpoint most of our professed poets. It may 
be said without hesitation that the use of all 
these literary gifts has immensely brightened his 
book and given it a chance for permanent fame. 
The average mind, unless personally interested, 
cannot follow the broken movements of a modern 
battle. Details of positions, roads, marches, 
battle-lines, attacks and repulses, are usually 
dry reading. In going back to the epic man-

incidents General Schaff has shown a wise 
artistic instinct. And though he has the poet's 
preference for beauty, and though he puts most 
stress as every writer on war who wishes to be 
read must do on the high spirits and magnifi- 
cent courage of his actors, he has not hesitated 
to dash the shadows into his picture. There are 
scenes enough of grim and grizly horror. 

Yet of course the book is history, is a record 
of fact, and presumably an accurate one. The 
author tells an amusing story about the diffi- 
culty of being correct in such matters. 

" Batchelder, whose map of Gettysburg is authority, 
. . . came to the army to verify the positions of the vari- 
ous commands. One night, after dinner, he entered, quite 
tired. 'Well,' he announced, taking his place at the table, 
' I have been in the Second Corps to-day, and I believe 
I have discovered how Joshua made the sun stand still. 

I went first to regiment and had the officers mark 

on the map the hour of their brigade's position at a cer- 
tain point. Then I went to regiment in the same 

brigade; they declared positively it was one or two 
hours earlier or later than that given by the others. So 
it went on, no two regiments or brigades agreeing, and 
if I hinted that some of them must certainly be mistaken, 
they would set me down by saying, with severe dignity, 
' We were there, Batchelder, and we ought to know, I 
guess ' ; and I made up my mind that it would take a day 
of at least twenty hours instead of thirteen at Gettys- 
burg to satisfy their accounts. So, when Joshua's cap- 
tains got around him after the fight and they began to 
talk it over, the only way under the heavens that he 
could ever harmonize their statements was to make the 
sun stand still and give them all a chance." 

General Schaff confesses that the strategy, 
grand tactics, and military movements of the 
war, stirring as these are, were not the features 
which engaged his deepest interest, but rather 
the spirit which animated the North and South. 
Perhaps he sees this through the haze of years ; 
but this only serves to bring his book into tone 
and harmony. We have spoken of the touch 
of magic which is often apparent in his style. 
Let us give a specimen. 

" And now, on those soft mountain and valley winds 
of memory, which always set in when anything pensive 
warms the heart, are borne the notes of bugles sounding 
taps in the camps around us on those long-vanished 
August nights. Camp after camp takes up the call, 
some near, some far. The last of the clear, lamenting 
tones die away sweetly and plaintively in the distance, 
and back comes the hush of night as of old. Again the 
sentinels are marching their beats slowly, most of them 
thinking of home, now and then one, with moistened 
eyes, of a baby in a cradle. Peace to the ashes of 
Warren, peace to those of the sentinels of the Army of 
the Potomac who walked their posts in those gone-by 
starry nights ! " 

Some of General Schaff's judgments we think 
are open to debate. He pleads with wistful 
eagerness for Meade, yet in the end ranks him 
below Sheridan and Sherman. We do not 



believe that time will endorse this verdict. His 
attitude toward Grant is that of simple rever- 
ence. For ourselves there seems to be a curious 
parallel to Grant's career in the Hannibalic 
War. Fabius and Marcellus and Nero were all 
greater soldiers, greater inventors in warfare, 
than Scipio ; but after they had worn down 
Hannibal's magnificent army until it was a mere 
shadow of a shade, Scipio came upon the scene, 
gave the final blow, and gained the ultimate and 
loftiest laurels. The flaw in this comparison is 
that Grant himself assisted in the wearing-down 
process, though in conflict with generals far 
inferior to Lee and his great lieutenants ; but 
against this may be set the large and im- 
portant share of credit belonging to Meade 
for the last year's operations. Again, Grant 
only carried out McClellan's policy of over- 
whelming the Confederacy by numbers. That 
he was allowed to do this, while McClellan was 
not allowed, probably arose not so much from 
any special strength of character in himself, as 
from the conviction at last forced upon the au- 
thorities at Washington that it was the only 
way. There are two orders of men of action, 
those who, with ample means and abundant 
resources, accomplish great things ; and those 
who with scanty means, or none at all, or against 
prodigious odds, achieve impossibilities. There 
can be no doubt as to the class in which Grant 
belonged. Judged by this test, not Grant the 
victor, but Lee the vanquished, is the central 
figure of the Civil War. And Meade, the only 
Northern leader who met Lee on terms of prac- 
tical equality and turned him back in disaster, 
deserves a place by his side. But Grant's un- 
assuming modesty, his generosity to his foe and 
generally to his fellow-commanders, mark him 
as a noble character. Victory but left him as 
it met him. He was a more determined power 
from defeat. Death could not shake his tran- 
quility. Honor to them all ; they were great 
men. 

Was it all worth while ? As one reads Gen- 
eral Schaff's book and realizes the visions of 
those meadows of the Rapidan and Rappahan- 
nock, and those dark tangled woods of the 
Wilderness, thick inlaid with patterns of fallen 
forms in blue and gray, it all seems a frightful 
waste. But we must wait. The blood sown in 
those mighty battles will yet bear noble harvests. 
Romance will rise and rear her altars through 
all that old Southern domain, and will set her 
saving mark upon those Northern thresholds 
whence our fathers issued forth. And General 
Schaff's book, with its fairness to friend and

AN ENGLISH TREATMENT OF GERM \ \ 
ROMANTICISM.* 



The root idea of the word " Romantic " has 
been used, somehow, in some form, almost ab 
tirbe condita. " All the great poets," says Mr. 
Arthur Symons, "have been Romanticists, except 
those of the eighteenth century." Romanticism 
has ever been, and will ever continue to be, so 
long as great poets poetize life. Yet there was 
once a prevalent opinion that Romanticism 
started in Germany about 1792, and died out 
about 1830. Romanticism was simply the pre- 
dominant feature of German literature during 
this period ; and from Germany it early spread, 
as a formal movement, over England, France, 
Italy, Poland, Russia, and Scandinavia. It has 
been treated at various times from the genetic, 
philosophic, analytic, biographic, and popular 
standpoint. Elaborate discussions began in 
Germany with those heavy works of Koberstein, 
Gervinus, and Julian Schmidt, works soon to be 
superseded by Haym's monumental Die roman- 
tische, Schule. Then there are the larger works 
of Heine (1833 ) ,Hettner(1850),Gautier) 1868), 
Brandes (1873), Phelps (1893), Huch (1899), 
Omond (1900), Beers (1901), and Symons 
(1909). The small monographs on individual 
phases of Romanticism are literally legion. Mr. 
Wernaer's " Romanticism and the Romantic 
School in Germany," however, not only super- 
sedes any work that has thus far appeared in 
English, but will stand the test of comparison 
with studies of similar aim in any language. 

There was a time when, if asked to define 
Romanticism, one would have dismissed the 
question with some such non-committal gener- 
ality as that it was a reactionary movement 
which in its attempt to resuscitate the Middle 
Ages unconsciously introduced mysticism. But 
that was the dark age of Romantic study. We 
now know better. We know that Romanticism 
was reconciliatory rather than reactionary, that 
there were a number of things about the Middle 
Ages actually hostile to the very spirit of Roman- 
ticism, that the Romanticists did almost nothing

MAXT. By Robert M. Wemaer. New York : D. Appleton

unconsciously, and that mysticism can also play 
a role in rationalism and realism. 

As Mr. Wernaer's title indicates, his book 
treats only the older group of German Romanti- 
cists, the " Romantic School"; and of this, only 
the great leaders the Schlegels, Wackenroder, 
Tieck, Novalis, Fichte. Schelling. and Schleier- 
macher. The author acknowledges manifest 
indebtedness to his predecessors. The work 
owes most to Ricarda Huch's Bliitezeit der 
Romantik. In some ways it is superior to 
Huch's work, in others it is simply different. 
This can be most clearly seen in the way each 
has treated that possibly most elusive feature of 
Romanticism, " irony." The work does not 
deal, except in the most meagre way, with 
Romantic form or style. The publisher's part 
in the book leaves something to be desired. The 
type-impression on some pages is so heavy that 
it shows through ; other pages are very pale. A 
few instances occur of badly muddled type. 
There are several typographical errors ; one 
of these, referring to Hiigli's Romanische 
Strophen^ etc.,9&"Romantische Strophen etc" 
is one that is generally found, even in card cata- 
logues. But since they are both about the same, 
this matters little. The author has italicized 
some untranslatable words and left unitalicized 
others. The italicized forms look better. These 
defects should be eradicated, root and branch, 
in the future editions that the work will likely 
enjoy. The Bibliography is modern, citing 
nearly a hundred monographs that postdate 
1880. The author's style is one to provoke 
comment, but not criticism ; it has peculiarities, 
but not defects. One only wonders at his fond- 
ness for the word " twist" Yet Arthur Symons 
gives J. J. Callanan a place among English 
poets because he once used this word, " The 
birds go to sleep by the sweet twist of her 
song." 

Mr. Wernaer has not only written about 
German Romanticism, he has also drawn a moral 
from its lofty aims and unreached goals. He 
makes a plea for Humanism as the golden middle 
way betweenClassicism of the Head and Romanti- 
cism of the Heart; between the legal temper 
and the sympathetic temper ; between obedience 
and freedom, duty and love. Literature, he 
says, represents life ; and Romanticism is soul- 
culture, it is love. This was the Romanti- 
cists' mission ; but they could not humanize it. 
They loved beauty, inner beauty, with a lover's 
love, blind to the hard realities that always con- 
front those who are not poets and whom poets 
must make free. They introduced a new sym- 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



375 



holism, a broader symbolism than that typified 
by the Versunkene Glocke or " The Ancient 
Mariner." This new symbolism received its 
birth through the metaphysical conception that 
when spirit is brought in contact with matter, 
the one is transformed into the other ; they do 
not merge, the spirit ever lingers on. Their 
works were the ambassadors of their own 
thoughts, feelings, moods, and dreams ; the 
visible representatives of something invisible. 
Symbolism defines Romantic style in its attempt 
to put soul into sense, to inebriate the forms 
of art with poetic nectar. 

Coming to the Romantic leaders, Wacken- 
roder is portrayed as one who devoted his whole 
life to purity of thought and the religious beauty 
of form and spirit, without being great as poet, 
critic, or writer, but with an immeasurable 
influence on Tieck, the poet of moods, mimicry, 
adaptation, of dreams and lack of seriousness. 
Then there was Fr. Schlegel, ingenuous, free- 
born, militant and intellectual ; A. W. Schlegel, 
with his great equanimity of critical temper, the 
man who first discovered Tieck and Wacken- 
roder to the reading public. There was Novalis, 
the mystic prophet and clairvoyant of the school, 
the Romanticist who lived in the spirit world 
while yet on earth, the man who was always 
"going home," the writer of fairy tales and epi- 
grams. There was Schleiermacher the preacher, 
who maintained that he was most religious who 
could get along without the Bible, who could, 
if necessary, write one himself. There was 
the somewhat retiring Dorothea Mendelssohn- 
Veit-Schlegel ; her real name was Brendel, but 
Fr. Schlegel (1798) called her Dorothea, and 
Dorothea she remained. And, finally, there 
was the forceful Caroline Michaelis-Bbhmer- 
Schlegel-Schelling. 

This account of the Romantic leaders covers 
94 pages, and is well worth while, since the 
book was written for an American public, un- 
acquainted with even the landmarks of Ger- 
man Romanticism. There follow 210 pages of 
delightful reading on the traditional themes 
that must concern this sort of work Impres- 
sionistic and Interpretative Appreciation of 
Art; the Romantic Mood; Nature Philosophy; 
Religion ; Beauty and Love ; Irony ; Novalis' 
"Hymns to the Night"; "Lucinde"; the Fairy 
Tale; the Blue Flower. On reading these 
pages, one gets the impression, it is hard to tell 
how, that the author read the works on which 
they are based over and over, time and time 
again, and then consigned to the page, not 
simply facts, but real revelations. To the tried 



student of Romanticism, they clear up some 
things. To the incipient student, they will 
open up a new world. 

The last two chapters contain the moral. 
The German Romanticists were cosmopolitans, 
and at the same time patriots, but only in the 
aesthetic sense, not in the political or social. 
They revived the art of Germany, but they 
thought there was only one art, only one 
poetry ; and this was the art, the poetry, of the 
world. They tried to be true to this cosmo- 
politan theory ; they pledged themselves to it. 
But in so doing, they neglected the call of those 
around them who were not poets, and whom 
they, as poets, were to make free. They had 
no time, no patience, for the social service of 
their day. They abounded in love, but lacked 
duty. They tried to reconcile the finite and the 
infinite, and in so doing they leaned too heavily 
on the infinite. They had enthusiasm with- 
out restraint. German Romanticism of the late 
eighteenth century has precious little meaning 
for us to-day. This is an age of democratic 
individualism, an age of service that needs 
restraint, obedience, law, and duty. Present- 
day literature must abandon photography and 
sensation, and concern itself only with that 
which is beautiful, yet wholesomely in accord 
with duty's laws. And the poet must not, like 
Heinrich in the Versunkene Glocke, attempt 
to flee from the realities of the finite world 
when the bells of every-day life are constantly 
calling him to service. Such in brief is the 
outline of this book.

TALKS ON CHARACTER AND 
TEMPERAMENT.* 



Professor Jastrow's forthcoming work on 
" Character and Temperament " is to be a con- 
tribution to the as yet unconstituted science 
which Mill postulated under the name of ethol- 
ogy. The little volume entitled " The Qualities 
of Men " is a popular presentation of the more 
general didactic and moral conclusions to which 
his severer studies have led him. With Pro- 
fessor Jastrow's ideas and aims we are in entire 
sympathy. His main plea is for a more discern- 
ing recognition of the qualities of men and 
things than is accorded by our democratic wor- 
ship of quantity, energy, bigness, and hustle. 
He pleads, to adopt his own terminology, for the 
conservation and encouragement of the poietic,

as well as of the kinetic, type of man. Especially 
timely is his protest against the domination of 
the kinetic type even in the university, where if 
anywhere the sense of the finer values ought to 
be fostered and preserved. 

The chief scientific and psychological interest 
of the book, a little disguised by the necessity of 
entertaining mixed audiences, is the attempt to 
trace the nicer shades and the higher qualities of 
mind and character to the common root of a 
keener and more delicate sensibility. From this 
point of view, the whole work may be taken as 
an expansion and psychological justification of 
Ruskin's declaration that " the essence of all 
vulgarity lies in want of sensation . . . blunt- 
ness of body and mind." 

Professor Jastrow's lucid intelligence invites 
and his candor makes it easy to practice frank- 
ness. We are free to say, then, that despite 
our complete agreement with its tendencies and 
teachings we like the book less than either of 
its predecessors, " Fact and Fable in Psychol- 
ogy" and "The Sub-Conscious," and less than 
we expect to like its successor. We do not think 
that the author has quite succeeded in harmon- 
izing the scientific and the hortatory or didactic 
points of view. In the interests of vivid and 
emphatic presentation, the popularizer employs 
summary classifications which must give the 
psychologist pause. One example will suffice. 
Under his " great divide," or " two-class divi- 
sion of humanity," he subsumes for literary illu- 
tration the antitheses of Athenian and Boeotian, 
of sulphite and bromide, of the gentleman and 
the vulgarian, and of the poietic and kinetic 
types. He is of course quite as well aware as 
tli'- reviewer can be of the cross-classifications 
to which this arbitrary procedure leads. The 
(technical) gentleman, as described in the oft- 
quoted paragraph of Professor James, which 
Professor Jastrow quotes again, may be the most 
soporific of bromides. The sulphite in conversa- 
tion and at the dinner table is not necessarily or 
perhaps even probably the originator, inventor, 
and leader in literature, science, or affairs. The 
specialization of faculty, native or acquired, as 
George Eliot is fond of reminding us, defeats all 
such summary and wholesale classifications. 

Our second cavil concerns what for the lack of 
an equally apt English work may be called the 
"preciosity" of the style. There are many ad- 
mirable and eloquent pages. But too often plain 
thoughts are not plainly and directly expressed, 
but are obscured by allusion, abstract circum- 
locution, and conceits. There are too many meta- 
phors, and too many of them are either mixed or 



relentlessly followed up. " The effort to develop 
a tonal facility becomes an unwarranted intru- 
sion upon an unwilling audience." " Discern 
that he is decoratively pur- blind." " Manner 
may beskin-deep, or even cosmetically achieved." 
" A whimpering, if not a crying need." " If I 
had to face the opulent necessity of a surgical 
operation." " The time-tested dictum of the 
Roman dramatist that in the country of the 
humanities no true man is foreigner." 

The public that heard these chapters as lec- 
tures doubtless applauded these and similar 
vivacities, and our censure may be thought 
captious. But we believe that Professor Jas- 
trow's second thoughts will concede that in a 
serious book such sallies are regrettable conces- 
sions to the very temper which he deprecates 
the taste which demands loud colors and crude 
effects at any cost. It is a style into which a 
clever writer, gifted with a large vocabulary and 
a quick fancy, is easily seduced by the notoriety 
which it has brought to some contemporary 
practitioners. But Professor Jastrow always 
has something definite to say, and his sound and 
sober thought does not need to hide inanity and 
confusion by meretricious ornament. We hope 
that he will return tb a style in which the truth 
can be told, a style whose main endeavor is to 
reproduce the very form and pressure of the 
truth as it is given to the writer to apprehend 
it. It is better to be sane than to be what the 
newspapers call " epigrammatic "; and in these 
days it is more of a distinction. Not the least 
of Professor Jastrow's distinctions as a psychol- 
ogist and as a popularizer, in the good sense of 
the word, is that he is eminently sane.

"Who is Polk?" was the derisive cry with 
which the Whigs greeted the nomination of the 
man who was to be President during those four 
fateful years in which slavery emerged as a 
nation-sundering issue. At the close of his 
administration, " Polk the mendacious " epito- 
mized the judgment of political opponents, and 
was echoed even by some who had earlier been 
adherents. To test the validity of such a verdict 
has, until very recently, been impossible, as 
materials were not available for an unbiased

judgment of the eleventh President of the 
United States. Intensity of partisan conviction 
permeated the works of Northern historians 
from 1850 to 1860, and in the decade following 
other men and newer issues were paramount. 
Even in the South no vigorous voice was raised 
in defense of one who at best was never re- 
garded as of the " inner circle " either politi- 
cally or socially. Yet Folk's administration was 
one of the most important in American expan- 
sion, and to-day interest is re-directed to his 
career and policies. Nor is the material for a 
careful study lacking. Over ten thousand of 
Folk's letters are in the possession of the Library 
of Congress ; while in the sixth month of his 
Presidency (August 1845), Polk began to keep 
a diary of each day's incidents, and continued 
it throughout the greater part of his four years' 
term. It is this diary, purchased some time 
since by the Chicago Historical Society, that is 
now presented in book form, and from it one 
may form some judgment of the justice or in- 
justice of contemporary opinion, as well as gain 
new light on vital historical incident. A copy 
of the diary, now in the Lenox Library at New 
York, was indeed made for the historian George 
Bancroft, a member of Polk's cabinet, probably 
with the intention of using it in an estimate and 
defense of his chief . But such use was never made 
of it, and the only writers who have as yet drawn 
upon the diary are Mr. J. S. Reeves, whose lec- 
tures on " American Diplomacy under Tyler and 
Polk" appeared in 1907, and Mr. G. P. Garrison, 
in his volume on " Westward Expansion." Both 
writers, however, were prohibited by the formal 
necessities of their publications from any ex- 
panded treatment of the man or his times. Thus, 
the importance of the present publication is great, 
both for student and historian. 

As Mr. Reeves well says, the sneer of " Who 

/ ' 

is Polk?" had been sufficiently answered at the 
end of his administration. The Diary shows 
him early determined upon four main points of 
his policy : settlement of the Oregon question, 
tariff reform, establishment of a sub-treasury, 
and acquisition of California ; and in each of 
these the object sought was attained. These 
were Polk's own policies, each approved by some 
group of his supporters, but all approved by 
none. That he thus carried through a pro- 
gramme is evidence of power, tenacity, possibly 
of good fortune. Certainly he was no mere figure- 
head. Quite evidently he was by nature secretive, 
listening attentively to the advice of his cabinet, 
commenting little, but ultimately formulating his 
own plan of action and adhering to it. Presum- 



ably this habit of silence is in part responsible 
for the charge of mendacity : for the silence that 
gives consent must often have been an irritation 
to officials who counted upon favors or acquies- 
cence from his receptive attitude, only to find 
themselves ignored in the outcome. 

As the intimate account of a personal ex- 
perience, the frank illumination of a personality, 
the Diary is disappointing. There is no key to 
Polk's tastes, or amusements, or ideals ; no ana- 
lysis of opinions ; no light on his mental pro- 
cesses. Neither are there reflections or com- 
ments upon successes or failures. There is no 
entertaining gossip. There is, apparently, not 
the least imagination or humor, and there is 
curious failure to discriminate, equal attention 
and space being bestowed upon foreign emis- 
saries and remote rural office-seekers. The man 
is sunk in the President, and there is only the 
record of the President's daily routine, stilted, 
concise, and, in the manner of it, wholly un- 
inspiring. Mr. Polk was strangely unemotional, 
given to the expression of neither elation nor 
despondency, and writing of himself with ab- 
surd formality. The first entry is August 26, 
1845, in which he writes, " The President 
stated," etc. October 1, "The President at- 
tended the Commencement of Columbia College 
today. . . He was accompanied from the Presi- 
dent's Mansion by the Secretary of War, the 
Attorney-General," etc. October 7. " Mr. 
Dallas, the Vice-President of the United States, 
called. . . He dined with the President at 4 
o'clock P. M. Maj'r A. J. Donelson returned 
from the North to-day, and took lodgings at the 
President's mansion. He dined with the Pres- 
ident, also." As time went on, however, Mr. 
Polk's oppressive consciousness of his august 
position became less novel and exacting, or the 
constant repetition of ceremonial forms became 
irksome ; for later in October, and for the 
greater part of the four volumes, he speaks of 
himself in the more natural first person. The 
only subject upon which he dwells at length is 
political intrigue, and this is treated at such 
length and with such seriousness as to create an 
impression of littleness of mind. And yet, in 
spite of the negative impression and lack of 
literary form or spirit, there runs throughout 
the daily journal a sense of country, and a bull- 
dog courage, that go far to redeem Polk from 
the stigma of mediocrity. 

Polk's first great problem was the settlement 
of the Oregon question with Great Britain. He 
had been elected on a platform asserting " the 
whole claim," "Fifty-four forty or fight."

THE DIAL 



[Nov. 16, 



Yet almost immediately he offered to accept 
the forty-ninth parallel, only to be rebuffed by 
Pakenham, the British Minister, in discourteous 
and insulting language. Polk then withdrew 
his proposal, and urged upon Congress measures 
looking toward American occupation of the 
entire territory in dispute. Apparently he was 
ready to go to war. After Pakenham 's refusal 
he writes (January 4, 1846): 

" I remarked . . . that the only way to treat John 
Bull was to look him straight in the eye; that I con- 
sidered a bold & firm course on our part the pacific 
one; that if Congress faultered or hesitated in their 
course, John Bull would immediately become arrogant 
and more grasping in his demands; & that such had 
been the history of the Brittish Nation in all their con- 
tests with other Powers for the last two hundred years." 

Ultimately he accepted from the British govern- 
ment, more reasonable than its representative, 
practically what he had himself proposed. For 
his conduct of this entire negotiation, Whig 
writers attacked him, either picturing him as a 
hypocrite in advocating the extreme American 
claim, with no intention of securing it, or as a 
blusterer whose threats nearly precipitated a 
war with England. Even Mr. Reeves doubts 
Polk's sincerity, and believes that he so artfully 
played the political game as to force upon others 
the odium of yielding a portion of the Oregon 
territory. To the present reviewer Polk seems 
sincere, but embarrassed by the approach of 
the Mexican War. If his Diary is to be taken 
at its face value, and not regarded wholly as a 
conscious defense for posterity, then he was 
absolutely convinced of the rightfulness of our 
claim. His first offer was made with reluctance, 
inspired by a sense of obligation to his prede- 
cessors, and he was, indeed, greatly relieved 
when Pakenham refused to consider it. Pend- 
ing a resumption of the question by Pakenham, 
Polk maintained an obstinate passivity, allow- 
ing no overture, and merely permitting a 
rumor to transpire that the President might 
consider a new offer if presented by Great 
Britain. Buchanan, the Secretary of State, 
was much alarmed at this determination, fear- 
ing that war was inevitable if such a line were 
persisted in, and argued in Cabinet meetings 
that this was not " wise statesmanship." Polk 
responded that it "was right in itself," and 
that the only way to force a conclusion to this 
long-delayed Oregon question lay in impressing 
upon the British government the imminence of 
a crisis. However remarkable the steps of 
this negotiation, and the President's attitude 
throughout, its satisfactory termination could 
reflect only credit on Polk's sagacity. 



The relations between the President and his 
Secretary of State were far from harmonious. 
Buchanan, fearing the results of a stiff foreign 
policy, chafed under the subordination imposed 
upon him, and yet from political ambition de- 
sired to escape responsibility. Polk was not 
blind to the anxiety for applause, the tendency 
to propitiate the public, in his Secretary, and 
in his Diary he reiterates his suspicions of 
Buchanan's intriguing for the Presidency. 
When the negotiations with Great Britain took 
a more peaceful turn, and it became clear that 
war was not to follow, Buchanan, appreciating 
that the popular voice was against the com- 
promise, made a complete face-about, seeking 
to evade responsibility. From the man who, 
dreading a foreign war, had counselled a still 
more generous treatment of the British agents, 
this reversal of position came with bad grace. 
Naturally Polk was very angry. The proposals 
of Great Britain were under discussion in the 
Cabinet: "He [Buchanan] said the 54 40' 
men were the true friends of the administration, 
and he wished no backing out on the subject. 
I felt excited at the remark but suppressed my 
feelings and was perfectly calm." In preparing 
the message to the Senate asking " previous 
advice " on the British proposal, Buchanan 
declined to aid the President. 

" He then said ; Well ! when you have done your 
message I will then prepare such an one as I think ought 
to be sent in. 1 felt excited at this remark, as he had on 
Saturday and on this morning refused to aid me in pre- 
paring my message, and I said to him, for what purpose 
will you prepare a message ? You have twice refused, 
though it is a subject relating to your Department, to 
give me any aid in preparing my message ; do you wish, 
after I have done, to draw up a paper of your own in 
order to make an issue with me ? He became excited 
and said that remark struck him to the heart, and asked 
me if I thought him capable of doing such a thing? I 
replied, you have twice refused to give me :m\ aid in 
preparing my message though requested to do so, and 
notwithstanding you see that I am overwhelmed with 
other important public duties and have been subject to 
constant interruptions, and now you say that after I 
have done you will prepare a message such as you think 
ought to be sent in ; and I asked him for what purpose 
will you do this, and he replied to submit it to you. I 
said, you have not before said that this was your pur- 
pose; to which he replied that it was to [be] implied 
that such was his purpose. I then told him that I 
thought I had cause to complain that he had not aided 
me when requested, but that if I had misunderstood 
him, I retracted the remark. The conversation became 
a very painful and unpleasant one, but led to mutual 
explanations that seemed to be satisfactory. I told him 
I had never had any unkind feelings towards him per- 
sonally or politically. He expressed his friendship for 
me and for Mrs. Polk. After a most unpleasant inter- 
view he retired."

Buchanan was but one, however, of the many 
aspirants to the Presidency whose principles, 
according to Polk, were determined by political 
expediency. Few men with whom he was asso- 
ciated in public life escaped his condemnatory 
judgment in this respect. During the Oregon 
controversy, but one man, Benton, seems to have 
had the President's full confidence, and to him 
he turned constantly for advice and counsel. 
Later, during the Mexican War, and particu- 
larly when Fremont's actions in California 
caused discord, Benton became less acceptable 
at the White House. Yet Benton's suavity and 
courtesy always appealed to Polk, for he was 
keenly sensitive, especially when new to office, 
to any word or attitude that seemed to reflect 
upon the dignity of his position. 

As time went on Polk's personality be- 
came better known and men learned at least 
to respect his determination and his gift in 
party manosuvring. The game to win occupies 
much more space than the larger objects for 
which the game is played. Polk understood 
better than any public man of his time, save 
Benton, the importance of the acquisition of 
California ; and yet Sloat's seisure of Monterey 
receives but a scant ten lines of notice. Was 
the California occupation so largely a foregone 
conclusion that no comment was called for, 
or was Sloat's action appreciated only in the 
retrospect ? Yet Polk generally believes that he 
held the statesman's point of view. On the last 
night of his term as President (March 3, 1849), 
he makes the following entry, of peculiar inter- 
est in these days of intense discussion of federal 
conservation : 

" I find that I have omitted to notice the passage by 
Congress, after night of this day's proceedings, of a Bill 
to establish the Department of the Interior, or home 
Department. It was presented to me for my approval 
late at night and [I] was much occupied with other 
duties. It was a long Bill containing many sections, 
and I had but little time to examine it. I had serious 
objections to it, but they were not of a constitutional 
character and I signed it with reluctance. I fear its 
consolidating tendency. I apprehend its practical opera- 
tion will be to draw power from the states, where the 
Constitution has reserved it, & to extend the jurisdiction 
and power of the U. S. by construction to an unwar- 
rantable extent. Had I been a member of Congress I 
would have voted against it." 

Judged by mere space, political management 
occupied most of Polk's attention ; and yet upon 
the subject of office-seekers and their persis- 
tence, words fail him, though his steadily in- 
creasing irritation and disgust frequently occupy 
his pen. October 19, 1848, he writes : 

" The office of President is generally esteemed a very 
high & dignified position, but really I think the public 



would not so regard it if they could look in occasionally 
and observe the kind of people by whom I am often 
annoyed. I cannot seclude myself but must be acces- 
sible to my fellow-citizens, and this gives an oppor- 
tunity to all classes and descriptions of people to obtrude 
themselves upon me about matters in which the public 
has not the slightest interest. There is no class of our 
population by whom I am annoyed so much, or for whom 
I entertain a more sovereign contempt, than for the 
professed office-seekers who have beseiged me ever 
since I have been in the Presidential office." November 
13, 1848: " The herd of office-seekers are the most un- 
principled persons in the country. As a mass they are 
governed by no principle. As an illustration of this I 
received to-day a slanderous & abusive letter from a 
man named Henry Simpson of Philadelphia. This man 
annoyed me by his letters for an office for more than 
two years of my time. He was disappointed, and now 
that I am about retiring he vents his bitter feelings. 
Such persons as he contributed largely to swell the 
vote of Taylor, the Whig candidate for the Presidency 
at the late election. This man Simpson professed to be 
an ardent Democrat whilst he was seeking office from 
me. He will now, I have little doubt, profess to be a 
Whig and be among the crowd of office seekers to 
Gen'l Taylor. There are thousands of unprincipled 
men like him who vote in elections according to their 
calculation of chances to get an office. The party in 
power will always be weakened by the votes of this, 
class of persons." January 10, 1849: "One Lady 
(Mrs. B.) a widow, called and importuned me to ap- 
point a gentleman whom she named who is now a clerk 
in one of the Departments. She appealed to me to 
appoint him upon the ground that she desired to marry 
him provided he could get an office that would support 
a family. She was a gay person of good character,, 
accustomed to good society, and was rather a pretty 
woman. She said she could not marry her lover while 
he was a Clerk, but that if I would appoint him a Pay- 
master in the army she would do so and would be very 
happy. The dispensation of the patronage of the Gov- 
ernment will weaken if not break down any administra- 
tion." January 11, 1849: "Men and women annoyed 
me for office for themselves, their relatives, and friends^ 
The people of the U. S. have no adequate conception of 
the number of persons who seek to live upon the Gov- 
erment, instead of applying themselves to some honest, 
calling to make a living. Several of those who called! 
to-day have importuned me half a dozen times for 
office. They have no claims upon the country and no 
individual merit. I cannot exclude them from my 
office, though I hold them in very low repute, and 
indeed I almost loath them when I see them entering 
my door." 

With such demands upon his time and for- 
bearance, surely even the Presidential office 
had its drawbacks. 

The period of Polk's administration was a 
fateful one in American history, and whether 
in relation to the play of parties, to Oregon, to 
the Mexican War, or to the great question of 
the use of the new territories, the four volumes 
of the Diary offer a rich opportunity and a 
great incentive to historical research.

A GUIDE-BOOK TO FICTION.* 



Mr. Arthur Ransome, after editing collect- 
ions of stories for the British public, has written 
a guide-book for his readers. He has L^im, 
not very happily, in the obscure regions of 
primitive story-telling ; he has followed more 
brilliantly with chapters on the narrative of 
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, has classi- 
fied the English novel of the eighteenth century 
into masculine and feminine, and concluded 
with very interesting discussions of such French, 
English, and American innovators as Scott, 
Hugo, Poe, and Flaubert. His book is one that 
forces a reviewer to quote again that much over- 
worked description of a certain kind of modern 
criticism, " the adventures of a soul amidst 
masterpieces." The author, as in most criticism 
of this nature, is sometimes inclined to put too 
much emphasis upon the adventures of his soul, 
and too little upon the absolute worth of the 
masterpieces. He sits with a pipe in his mouth, 
a cup of tea at his elbow (the description is his) , 
and runs over the centuries and their stories 
with an audacity that must shock the modern 
student of periods. And yet he writes pleasantly, 
is informing, sometimes illuminating ; and above 
all he tries, in a jocular fashion, to do some- 
thing new. He is one of the first to attempt to 
popularize the study of narrative technique. 

It is a much easier and perhaps a more im- 
portant task to write of personalities than of 
technique in literature. No wonder, then, that 
most critics of literature have chosen the former 
for their subject. And yet, for a history of 
the changing varieties of literary types, form, 
with the technical methods which lead to it, is 
all important. It is the register of that which 
belongs to art and not to psychology in those 
changes, and alone can give an effective unity 
to the whole. A writer upon such a subject 
must keep form chiefly in view. But unfortu- 
nately it is only the artist and the critic who have 
a natural interest in technical methods. The 
casual reader is after the kernel, and seldom 
cares for the shell. Being unaware that content 
and form are interdependent, he shies from a 
discussion of the latter as from a needless analy- 
sis which makes an artistic complexity of what 
he thought to be a simple story. The feeling 
is natural ; and if it be well that readers of 
fiction should sometimes consider the art as well 
as the substance of their favorites, the way to 
critical appreciation should be made as attract- 
ive as possible. Mr. Ransome has felt the

Illustrated. New York: Frederick A. Stoke. Co. 



desirability of an amiaUe introduction into the 
criticism of types of fiction, and his hook is 
a not unsuccessful attempt to provide one. 
Although there are many interesting theories 
and brilliant characterizations to be credited to 
the author, much of its historical and critical 
material is not new ; but it would be difficult to 
find a summary of the development of the art 
of fiction more likely to be read through and 
enjoyed. 

Mr. Ransome has not found his task an easy 
one. The paths of literary personality are 
seductive to the writer for non-professional 
audiences, and one can see the author turning 
away again and again from subjects more pleas- 
ant than types and purposes in story-telling. 
His restraint is praiseworthy. It has enabled 
him to bend in a truly critical manner the lives, 
the tastes, the ideas, and the world of his 
authors towards an explanation of their art, 
and this is a service in which more scholarly 
critics have often failed because of their very 
single-mindedness. At the expense of thorough- 
ness, and occasionally of accuracy, he has given 
a desirable breadth to his survey of fiction 
which more laborious students have often 
missed. The cost must not be overlooked. To 
classify all primitive narrative into the Warn- 
ing Example and the Embroidered Exploit is 
amusing, but ignores the animistic origin of 
much of our story-telling. Letters were by 
no means new in narrative when Richardson 
began, and it was less the letter form than the 
adoption of the plot of the novella for such 
material as Addison and Steele had been busy 
with which "helped him to be new himself." 
If it is most interesting to connect Poe with 
Godwin, who also constructed his stories with a 
" powerful interest " always in view, it is none 
the less important that his close connection with 
the English and German romanticism of his 
own day should be shown. And one wonders 
whether it is safe, even in a book which counts 
by centuries, to stop with Flaubert, as the 
" ultimate development of the Romantic move- 
ment without a change of name." And yet 
these and other questions which arise as one 
reads are not serious except in so far as they 
make up a criticism which must necessarily be 
passed upon a book of this kind. No series of 
generalizations, however brilliant, and however 
sane, can be entirely satisfactory unless their 
substructure be broad and sound. In Mr. 
Ransome's work there is little room for sub- 
structure ; one must too often take it upon trust. 
The powerful and complex inHuenuea of the

Orient, Eome, and Greece, recurring in many 
forms and in many centuries, but too little 
treated here ; the stimulus from romantic Ger- 
many, not so inconsiderable as to be passed by 
without mention ; that perpetual cross-reference 
between the romancers of the nineteenth cen- 
tury, with whom our author chooses to deal, 
and the realists, whom he puts aside ; the close 
and important relations borne by the obscure 
literature of an epoch to the masterpieces which 
have inspired this study, an absence of due 
consideration of all these makes one hesitate 
again and again before accepting conclusions in 
themselves persuasive and doubtless correct. 

But there was no room, and the casual reader 
will not endure an exhumation of the grave- 
yards of the past! Exactly, and here is the 
root of the whole matter. If Mr. Ransome 
had put more paper on his desk, more scholar- 
ship in his ink bottle, and more reading of dull 
and forgotten fiction in his head ; if he had 
made a new contract with his publishers, and 
served notice upon the light-minded among his 
readers, he might have grasped that admirable 
opportunity to write a thorough survey of fiction 
which his methods and his good judgment seem 
to have given him. But he or any one might 
readily fail in so arduous a task, whereas he 
has certainly presented us with a moderately 
comprehensive, occasionally brilliant, and thor- 
oughly readable popularization of the technique 
of fiction. HENRY SEIDEL CANBY.

of " The Old Wives' Tale " know so well. When 
we say that the new novel is quite the equal of the 
earlier one, possibly surpassing it in relentless real- 
ism and grim power, we say enough to indicate 
that it is a work of extraordinary importance. In 
the larger sense, it gives us an account of the social 
evolution of an English provincial community during 
the closing three decades of the nineteenth century; 
in the narrower and more intensely vitalized sense, 
it is concerned with the fortunes of one Darius 
Clayhanger, printer and stationer, and of his son 
Edwin. There are other figures, sisters, an aunt, 
employees, friends, and acquaintances, but these 
two are dominant, and with these two alone, vividly 
and minutely realized, typically significant, we are 
chiefly occupied. The tragedy of the narrative is 
found in the crushing influence of the older genera- 
tion upon the younger; Edwin has impulses and 
aspirations which might have borne fruit in a more 
favorable environment, but he is just lacking in the 
strength of will needed to free him from the iron 
tyranny of prescription. The struggle is soon 
over it is a struggle that hardly gets outside the 
arena of his own thoughts and he settles down to 
plod in his father's footsteps, take on the abhorred 
business, and forget that he has ever been tempted 
to revolt. This novel is, as we said of the earlier 
one, a tale of mean lives in mean surroundings, but 
the truth of its portrayal is so insistent that we 
are ready to acquiesce in the absence of most of 
the elements that go to make up ordinary romance. 
The author is so afraid of drifting into any sem- 
blance of sentimentality that he seems at times 
positively inhuman. His own hatred for Darius 
matches that of the son, and even the spectacle of 
the old man in his last stage of hopeless paresis can 
hardly wring from him a suggestion of tender sym- 
pathy. It is impossible to describe this book in 
honest terms that shall make it appear attractive, 
yet such is its power that we would not spare a 
single page; the very trivialities with which it 
mainly deals are touched with such genius that we 
find them interesting against our will, and we must 
admit that they are needed for the total effect of 
the composition. The book is open to one serious 
criticism. Hilda, the young woman whom Edwin 
loves, and who accepts him in one moment only to 
turn from him in the next, is not a real person in 
the present narrative. As some one says of her, 
" She's nothing at all for about six months at a 
stretch, and then she has one minute of the grand 
style." We learn why she is thus left a mystery 
when we read the appended note which promises a 
whole novel about her next year, and we have no 
doubt that we shall know her inmost nature when 
that novel shall be in our hands ; but it is certainly 
a defect of artistry thus deliberately to evade the 
full responsibilities of one work in order to keep 
sufficient material for another yet to be written. 
Her conduct, as we here get glimpses of it, has 
neither rhyme nor reason, while her appearance 
and her character are so inadequately portrayed 



THE DIAJL 



[Nov. 16, 



that Edwin's infatuation is nowise accounted for. 
To the present reader of Edwin's age, which means 
in the early fifties, the book has a special, interest 
in which younger readers cannot share. Pursuant 
to his larger purpose, the author has filled his nar- 
rative with echoes from the past, which evoke in us 
all sorts of dim memories. The things that were 
doing in the outside world, and of which even the 
Five Towns got some sort of inkling political 
happenings, currents of fresh thought, and the 
progress of civilization are brought into personal 
relations with the Clay hanger prejudices, and thus 
we read from time to time of such matters as 
Colenso and the higher criticism, home rule, Glad- 
stone and Parnell, the Queen's Jubilee, the obstinacy 
of Northampton in sending Bradlaugh to Parlia- 
ment, the prayer gauge " (here by a curious slip 
attributed to Thompson instead of Tyndall), "The 
Light of Asia," and the early epidemics of influenza. 
All these historical matters are deftly made to serve 
their purpose in the author's work of characteriza- 
tion, and at the same time to help to bring back a half- 
forgotten age. There are to be two more novels in 
the series the story of Hilda, already spoken of, 
and a final volume dealing with the life of Edwin 
and Hilda after their long-delayed marriage. 

If we had not previously received proofs of Mr. 
Bennett's versatility, we should wonder that the 
same pen should have produced " Clayhanger " 
and "Helen with the High Hand." " In the Five 
Towns," he says, human nature is reported to be 
so hard that you can break stones upon it." This 
readers of "Clayhanger" will readily admit, but 
when he adds that " sometimes it softens, and then 
we have one of our rare idylls of which we are very 
proud," the assertion needs the confirmation supplied 
by the light-hearted comedy of " Helen with the 
High Hand." The young woman thus designated 
is the great-stepniece of James Ollerenshaw, a 
bachelor of sixty, and the miserly accumulator of 
miserable weekly shillings from the several hundred 
cottages which he owns. Owing to an ancient feud, 
he has not recognized Helen's existence for the 
twenty-five years of her life, but one day that de- 
signing young woman insinuates herself into his life 
to the extent of becoming his housekeeper without 
asking his permission. The shock is twofold, for 
she gives him surprisingly good things to eat, and 
worries the wits out of him by her reckless expendi- 
ture. She soon lias him as wax in her hands, per- 
suades him, by alternate cajolery and the threat of 
going away, to purchase a mansion and live in it, 
and in the end he is prepared weakly to submit to 
her most irrational demands. His enlarged acquaint- 
ance with feminine nature inspires him to the auda- 
city of loving and winning a portly widow of the 
town (not without encouragement, it must be ad- 
mitted), and his evolution is complete. Meanwhile, 
Helen has a little love affair of her own, which her 
resourceful talent enables her to bring to the desired 
issue. It is capital fooling, humorously charming 
from start to finish, and we are glad to have it as a 



pendant to Mr. Bennett's gloomy large-scale depic- 
tions of the Five Towns. 

A modified version of the tale of Tristan and 
Isolde is given us in " Masters of the Wheat- Lands," 
by Mr. Harold Bindloss. An English wheat-farm, r 
in the Canadian Northwest has for years been 
betrothed to a girl in England- She has been self- 
supporting as a singer, but the loss of her voice 
throws her upon the world, and the man realizes 
that the time has come for the fulfilment of his 
pledge. But he cannot very well leave his farm, 
and so he deputes a neighbor (who is going to Eng- 
land anyway) to bring the promised bride out to 
her new home. His choice of a messenger is ill- 
advised, for the man who undertakes the mission is 
a hero of the type frequently depicted by Mr. Bind- 
loss, and the man who sends him is a shiftless sort 
of person, weak of will, and coarsened by his life on 
the prairie. The young woman draws the inevitable 
comparison, and when she reaches her new home, 
finds that she and her former lover have grown hope- 
lessly away from one another. It is a long while 
before the claims of conscience and the call of duty 
are adjusted to the new state of affairs, but in the 
end Tristan (without Tristan's treachery) prevails 
over the rather despicable King Marke, who, for his 
part, finds facile consolation in another quarter. 
The story thus offers something of a variant upon 
the author's stereotyped plan of construction, al- 
though in the matters of description and characteri- 
zation it follows familiar lines. What finally wins 
the heroine is a Quixotic enterprise undertaken by 
the hero for the rescue of an old-time companion 
stranded in the wilds of Kamschatka. This adven- 
ture, brought to a successful issue, is given us with 
great detail, and, although interesting enough in it- 
self, makes too great a gap in the continuity of the 
narrative. When the hero returns, affairs are 
brought to a swift conclusion. 

Captain Gilson's story of " The Refugee " is a 
spirited romance of the Napoleonic period. The 
chief figure is a fascinating and villainous French- 
man who joins the ranks of the emigres, finds shelter 
in an English country home, and makes love to the 
daughter of the house. But he is not fascinating 
enough to blind the object of his affections to his 
real character, and when he fails to win her by fair 
means, resorts to foul. Having become a turncoat 
and a spy in the pay of Napoleon, he plots to f urther 
the impending invasion, and incidentally to kidnap 
the girl. The story of his evil machinations and 
how they are foiled makes agreeable reading, and 
provides us with picturesque companions, notable 
among whom is the celebrated highwayman who 
gets mixed up in the plot, and whose audacious ex- 
ploits make us almost sorry for him when he is at 
last laid by the heels. 

Readers who found in Mr. Booth's "The Post 
Girl " one of the most charming of last year's novels 
will take similar pleasure in reading its successor, 
*' The Doctor's Lass." The doctor is a country prac- 
titioner in Yorkshire, and his life has been blighted

many years before by the flight of his betrothed 
with another man. He has brooded over it ever 
since, fallen into slovenly ways, and taken to drink. 
Now comes a letter from the deathbed of the woman 
who had wronged him, describing the miserable 
consequences of her action, and begging the doctor 
to look after her child, a girl of twelve or there- 
abouts. The responsibility is reluctantly assumed, 
and the child is sent for. But she looks like her 
mother, and the doctor cannot bear the sight. The 
bulk of the book tells how she insinuates herself 
into his affections, makes him mend his ways, and 
in the course of the proper number of years, aston- 
ishes him with the discovery that he is in love with 
her. There must, of course, be a set-back, and this 
is provided by her fancied attachment to a curate, 
which makes the doctor very miserable. Then her 
father turns up, a drunken criminal, and resorts to 
blackmail. This is too much for the curate, who 
loses no time in showing his colors, whereupon the 
girl discovers that it is her guardian whom she really 
loves after all. The story is rather excessively drawn 
out at times, and the agony a little more pro- 
tracted than it need be, but there are interest and 
vitality and wholesome charm in every chapter, and 
a style that is far out of the common. 

In its central situation, " The Greatest Wish in 
the World," by Mr. E. Temple Thurston, is not 
unlike Mr. Booth's appealing story. It is, of course, 
a very old situation, being that created when a girl, 
reared from early childhood by a man of middle 
age, so entwines herself in his affections as to create 
an almost tragic complication when the mating 
impulse possesses her, and he is threatened with the 
going out of the very light of his life. The artistic 
solution of this problem is probably to face the facts 
and let nature have her way, but if the novelist is 
sentimentally inclined he will follow the path of 
least resistance, as Mr. Booth does, and leave the 
girl in the protecting care of the man who is old 
enough to be her father. No such evasion is possible 
to Mr. Thurston, however, for the guardian of his 
heroine is a Catholic priest and there is nothing for 
it but that he should nerve himself for the inevitable 
bereavement. His Peggy is a very lovable creature, 
but her sailor-suitor seems to be quite worthy of her, 
and the misunderstanding which almost causes her 
to end her days in a convent is happily cleared up, 
with the connivance of Father O'Leary, just in time 
to save two young lives for earthly happiness. " The 
Greatest Wish in the World " is of course, that of 
having a child to cherish, and this is equally shared 
by Father O'Leary and his rather terrifying house- 
keeper, both of whom must suffer when Peggy 
takes her flight. The poignancy of the situation is 
softened for us as much as possible, and a sort of 
sunset glow the radiance of bright memories 
is made to play about their lives that are left desolate. 
The story is very genuine and very human, but we 
do not quite like the affectation of familiarity with 
the reader in which the author so frequently in- 
dulges. There is much impertinent matter of this 



kind that must be described as padding, and had 
far better have been excised. 

The sort of story that Mr. E. Phillips Oppenheim 
writes (at the rate of about two a year) may make no 
claim to serious critical consideration, but it cannot 
be denied that the author has acquired an admirable 
technique of the sort demanded by the novel of 
intrigue and mystery. He never lets the interest 
drag, he contrives dramatic situations in rapid suc- 
cession, and he keeps his secret well in hand until 
the time comes to let it out. " The Lost Ambas- 
sador " offers a typical example of Mr. Oppenheim's 
craftsmanship, and its easy man-of-the-world manner 
makes it entertaining reading. The hero discovers 
the heroine in the first chapter, constitutes himself 
her knight-errant, believes in her when appearances 
are most against her, and earns his final reward by 
the intelligence and devotion with which he ferrets 
out the mystery in which she has become entangled. 
It is all very neatly managed and to fairly exciting 
effect. 

Most detective stories plunge us into bewilder- 
ment and keep us there until the closing chapter, 
when we are vouchsafed a hurried and forced ex- 
planation that does not half explain. If it were worth 
while (which it usually isn't), we should have to go 
through the whole story again to untie all of its knots 
with the help thus tardily furnished. Now Mr. 
A. E. W. Mason, who writes "At the Villa Rose," 
claims our gratitude for the particularity with which 
he clears things up at the end, and his example de- 
serves imitation. Otherwise, the story is of fairly 
conventional pattern. The scene is at Aix-les- Bains, 
and the interest is in the murder of a rather vulgar 
middle-aged woman. Her companion (the heroine) 
is suspected, and the man whom we at first take for 
the hero turns out to be the criminal. Then the 
story takes an unexpected turn, for the celebrated 
French detective who has unravelled the mystery 
finds that he has also won the love of the } r oung 
woman whose name he has cleared. 

Although Dutch types of character have provided 
the leading figures in the later novels of "Maarten 
Maartens," they have been given something like a 
cosmopolitan setting, and been shaped by the in. 
fluences of the larger world. In " Harmen Pols," 
however, the author recurs to his earlier task, and 
draws his inspiration wholly from his native air. 
He has indeed, in local visualization and narrow con- 
centration of purpose, given us a more intimate pic- 
ture of Dutch life the racy and circumscribed life 
of the Dutch peasant than is to be found in any 
of the book's predecessors. It is a very small plot that 
he cultivates, but the cultivation is in the highest 
degree intensive. He has set himself to describe 
the spiritual tragedy of three lives the peasant-

is made upon the family farm, and the household is 
threatened with ruin. The boy tries to set matters 
to rights, and uncovers a complication of old in- 
iquities that threatens the very citadel of his soul. 
This test is the making of his character, and the 
redeeming ministries of pity and love achieve his 
rescue. The reality of the book fairly grips the 
reader, and the harsh outlines of the grim narrative 
are softened by tender and imaginative touches. 
The power of the story is no less marked than its 
fidelity to fact, and it is, as far as the chief figures 
are concerned, a triumph of artistic characterization. 
" The Lady of the Spur," by Mr. David Potter, 
is a story of love and excitement, with the adven- 
turous sort of hero and the pert sort of heroine that 
can always be counted on to provide entertainment. 
It offers a slight departure from the conventional 
type in the setting provided for it, which plunges 
us neither into the thick of modern life nor into the 
romantic atmosphere of the far distant past. The 
period is something less than a hundred years ago, 
when the name of Andrew Jackson was one to 
conjure with, and the scene is in the pine barrens 
of New Jersey. One Tom Bell, an escaped high- 
wayman under sentence of death, returns to this 
place after seine years of absence, trusting that he 
is so changed as to be safe from recognition. He 
comes to bring news of the death of one Henry 
.Mnrv;in. who has been his chum on the Missouri. 
But when he arrives, he is impelled to pass himself 
off as Morvan, whereby he takes possession of valu- 
able estates, and takes up the life of a country 
gentleman. His new life is beset by many perils, 
because his unexpected appearance frustrates the 
hopes of the rightful heirs, and a gang of masked 
nightrriders seeks to scare him away. He keeps up 
the imposture for the sake of a fair cousin with 
whom he falls in love, and balks the schemes of 
various villains at much personal danger. Finally, 
he makes a full confession, but the haughty heroine 
has capitulated, and then it turns out that he had 
never really been a highwayman, but a scapegoat, 
and that President Jackson has long since signed a 
full pardon for him. Thus is he ingeniously ex- 
tricated from what seems an impossible situation, 
and we may henceforth approve of him without 
the stirrings of conscience that have troubled us 
heretofore. The story is an exceptionally good one 
of its rather trifling but undoubtedly entertaining 
kind. 

His real name is Elam Harnish, but they call 
him " Burning Daylight," a fact ostensibly ac- 
counted for by a rather pointless anecdote, but better 
explained by the natural revolt of sensible men 
against such a legal appellation as belongs to him. 
His habitat is Alaska, where he is a superman, ex- 
celling all his fellows in feats of strength and daring, 
in recklessness at the gaming-table, and in general 
deviltry. Mr. Jack London, who has fashioned him 
for our delectation, evidently likes him, and glories 
in his varied brutalities, which is not surprising when 
we think of certain of the author's earlier essays in 



portraiture. " Daylight" has a " hunch " that makes 
him one of the first discoverers of the Klondike, and 
carries him through speculative operations whereby 
he cleans up " some ten millions in a couple of 
years. Then he betakes himself to New York, where 
a group of high financiers successfully " play him 
for a sucker," and transfer the ten millions to their 
own pockets. Being a superman, he then forces 
them to disgorge at the pistol's point, and carries his 
ten millions back to the Pacific coast. Settling in 
San Francisco, he plunges into the financial game 
himself (having profited by experience), and his ten 
millions soon grow to thirty in consequence of a 
series of unscrupulous enterprises, which reveal him 
as the most desperate cut-throat of the gang. But 
one day he discovers that his muscles are growing 
flabby, and that he has been drinking too much for 
his health. At the same time he discovers unex- 
pected charms in his private stenographer, and pur- 
sues her with his customary violence. But to his 
surprise she will have none of his millions, persuad- 
ing him that the game is not worth the cost, and that 
what he really needs is to cultivate the simple life. 
Whereupon he " chucks " the whole game, throws 
his fortune into the scrap-heap, and retires to a 
modest ranch to earn a living by the sweat of his 
brow. The young woman, seeing what havoc her 
influence has wrought, can do no less than go with 
him, yielding to the man what she had obstinately 
refused to the millionaire. His regeneration is 
worked out with less of the usual bathos than might 
have been expected, and is a thoroughgoing perform- 
ance. The whole story is deliciously and glaringly 
absurd, and done in the crudest of colors, but it has 
the merits of swift action and forcible expression, 
and is, on the whole, rather better work than the 
author has been giving us of late. He preaches a 
gospel that is wholesome (barring its socialistic 
vagaries) and much needed in our frenzied com- 
mercial age. WILLIAM MORTON PAYNK. 



BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS. 



A tone view 
of mdium$ 



to U8e * me emphasis in 
speaking of the " Studies in Spirit- 
i sm by Dr. A my E. Tanner, who 
has had the active cooperation of Dr. G. Stanley 
Hall in preparing her papers for publication. As a 
scientific survey of an elusive group of phenomena 
popularly misconceived, and by the prestige of 
"psychic researchers" distorted to support an alien 
construction, the present book ( Appleton) becomes a 
serious plea for the rights of both logic and psy- 
chology. Toward any very special subject, the public 
can assume but a casual attitude, and must ]>erforce 
judge by general appearances and draw distinctions 
loosely. To such, psychology and "psychic re- 
search" seem much alike; and the former has at 
times been looked upon as a dull evasion of the 
latter. Their very different manner of conducting

their affairs is too commonly overlooked. Hence the 
need of emphasis to make an impression. Further- 
more, a sensational eagerness for the marvellous and 
the obscure inclines to all that makes for the reality 
of telepathy, and for the evidential value of Mrs. 
Piper's sittings, and for the superphysical origin of 
Paladino's table levitations. The public listens only 
when a dramatic collapse makes a clatter that finds 
a response in shouting headlines. Mrs. Piper cannot 
be dramatically exposed; she must be rendered trans- 
parent to a reflective insight. Yet that difference 
does not obscure the important point in common: 
that the interpretation of such phenomena as revela- 
tions of unknown forces is just superstition, pure and 
simple, only not very pure and not very simple. 
For a stirring arraignment of this modern revival of 
outworn attitudes, Dr. Hall's masterly introduction 
should be read. How far it will serve as an antidote 
seems uncertain; but it prepares the way for Miss 
Tanner's findings of the facts in the case, as they ap- 
peared in six well-arranged sittings. The record is 
inevitably detailed, and to some the reading will be 
tedious. But it is all necessary to the analysis, as 
well as to show the hollowness of Mrs. Piper's (or 
her protagonists') pretences, and the amateurish 
irrelevance of the telepathic and similar " eviden- 
tial " hypotheses. Suffice it to say that Mrs. Piper 
and her spirit controls fell into obvious traps, and 
made just such good guesses and such bad ones as 
were natural for her natural assumptions, assisted 
by a skilful " fishing " for clues and a practised 
handling of the landing-net. The psychological side 
of the story is the more interesting: on the part of 
the sitters, much favorable prejudice, more prepos- 
session and exaggeration, and a system of apologetics 
that creates prodigious coincidences of incidental 
trifles ; on the medium's side, a trance-state that finds 
explanation as a variant of secondary personality, 
suggestive in the mode of its absorbing its mental 
stimulus and its suppressed reactions to the situa- 
tions. The trance-personality. Dr. Hall regards as 
sufficiently near of kin to the responsible Mrs. Piper 
to enable her to prepare a very illuminating account 
of the doings of her silent partner. Yet on the whole 
there is no great excitement in these four hundred 
pages ; though the presentation of the evidence does 
not lag, and the summing up and charge to the public 
jury are most ably delivered. It is a book worth 
a large and serious attention. Its point of view 
should be absorbed, and the significance of the case 
appreciated. Those with predilections for flying to 
forces that we know not of, owe it a careful hearing. 
Such a volume is indeed needed, and the investiga- 
tions that make it strong and sound, while not in 
themselves over-fruitful, will in the end makepossible 
an attitude of wholesome interest in the true signi- 
ficance of even the vagaries of the mental life. For 
this service, Miss Tanner and Dr. Hall deserve and 
will receive much credit. They must also be pre- 
pared to learn something about their motives and 
conduct and intelligence that their conscious selves 
have not as yet revealed to them. 



A new sheaf of those sprightly essays 
wherewith Dr. Samuel McChord 
Crothers periodically entertains and 
not seldom instructs " Atlantic " readers, is just at 
hand. " Among Friends " (Houghton) takes its 
name from the opening paper, which treats, among 
other things, of that good understanding and good 
humor which make possible the exhilarating give 
and take of good conversation. " The Anglo- 
American School of Polite Unlearning " is a whimsi- 
cal account of a supposed institution for the cure of 
international prejudice. "The Hundred Worst 
Books " and " The Convention of Books" will tickle 
the erudite and those whose days are passed in 
libraries. " In Praise of Politicians " has a good 
word to say even for the opportunist in statecraft, 
and it offers for our acceptance the useful word 
" politicaster " ( after the analogy of " poetaster ") 
to denote the less admirable follower of the noble 
calling of politics, as distinguished from the politi- 
cian who will be known after his death as a states- 
man. " Missionary Life in Persia, with Some 
Remarks on Liking One's Job " cannot be character- 
ized in two lines ; but it finely advocates the sports- 
manlike and cheery attitude toward the task in 
hand. " The Colonel in the Theological Seminary," 
"The Romance of Ethics," and "The Merry 
Devil of Education " indicate merely by their titles 
that happy conceits and amusing freaks of fancy, 
together with a sufficiency of more serious matter, 
are to be found in the chapters which they head. 
While the book abounds in its author's customary 
felicities of style and happy turns of thought, it 
seems to betray here and there a suggestion of the 
influence of Mr. Chesterton. It is difficult to escape 
the Chestertonic infection even if one has never read 
him. He is in the air. But we are assured that 
Dr. Crothers both reads and admires his British 
contemporary essayist. The following fragment 
from " Among Friends " inevitably reminds one of 
the staccato style so familiar to us from across the 
water : " Find out what Natural Law is about to 
make everybody do, and do it before they know 
what it is. That is success. Success consists, not 
in doing what you want to do and doing it well ; it 
is doing what you have to do and being quick about 
it." With the style, something of its originator's 
superabundance of thoughts and subter-abundance 
of thought may possibly be discovered ; yet we would 
not positively affirm this. It is a tendency, how- 
ever, to be guarded against. 

The charm Mr> ^ert Gehring, in his interesting 

and mystery and valuable book on "The Basis 
of Music. of Musical Pleasure" (Putnam), 

treats his subject mainly from the inductive and 
external side. He states that there is as yet no 
such thing as a genuine explanation of the pleasure 
inherently belonging to music, although we have 
many indications of the varied sources from which 
that pleasure springs. He discusses the power of 
tone, the significance of musical form, the halo of 



THE DIAL 



[Nov. 1, 



associative fascinations by which music is encircled, 
the effectiveness of music in its power to symbolize 
in many ways the light or serious experiences of 
men, and the remarkable parallelisms which exist 
between the intellectual and emotional life of the 
race on the one side and the structure and develop- 
ment of music on the other. To this last section 
of his subject he gives -his best and most decided 
attention ; and it is certainly worthy of the promi- 
nence in which he puts it. In fact, it contains 
within itself the possibility of an organic summation 
of all the other sources, and the placing of them in 
such relation as will make plain their comparative 
value and importance. Mr. Gehring is everywhere 
a suggestive and interesting writer, but he makes 
no pretense to be complete or systematic, and in 
the end is altogether too modest about the results 
attained. Thus he says : " Here we must conclude 
our research. It is better to make a frank confession 
of ignorance, than to indulge in empty guesses and 
untenable hypotheses. Let us hope that the problem 
is not essentially incapable of explanation, and that 
a day may arrive which shall witness a solution of 
the puzzling mysteries." It may perhaps be said 
that this day has already arrived. The mystery of 
music is neither more nor less than the mystery of 
any art. The secret of architecture is just as far to 
seek as that of music, and, indeed, the two have much 
in common. The Ninth Symphony of Beethoven 
may very well be likened to a Gothic cathedral, and 
the import of one is similar to the import of the 
other. Music, being the last of the arts to mature, 
is also the last to find its theory and explanation. 
Mr. Gehring's book is a hopeful sign. We think 
he will come to have a better opinion of opera 
than he seems at present to hold, and will entirely 
recognize that the world of emotion, complex and 
intricate, finds a consummate expression in the world 
of sound, cognately complex and intricate, and that 
the resultant music takes an equal place with the 
other arts in its revelation of the best and highest 
in the experiences of mankind. The book deserves 
the attention of all lovers and students of music. 



imr>re,ionof Having published his impressions 
an undeveloped and opinions of various other foreign 
commonwealth. Countr ie8, Mr. John Foster Eraser 
now adds Australia to the list " Australia: The 
Making of a Nation" (Cassell) gives a picture 
of the country as the author saw it in his visit of a 
year ago. A vast territory with but four million 
inhabitants, and those largely congregated in a few 
chief cities ; rather over-supplied with labor laws, 
and constrained to heed the mandates of the labor 
unions ; provided with government-owned railroads, 
and needing for the development of her vast re- 
sources many more miles of railroad than she is likely 
to get for a long time to come, this young and hope- 
ful commonwealth is revealed in the pages of Mr. 
Fraser's book as a paradise not without its jungles 
a land unquestionably delightful to the curious and 
observant visitor, but suffering from a variety of 



ills known and unknown elsewhere. If the climate 
were different, if legislation could be modified, if it 
were not for the rabbit pest, and so on with a gen- 
erous provision of ifs, Australia would be the ideal 
of what a country ought to be. Pending the reali- 
zation of these conditions, most of us are content to 
visit this over-grown and under-populated island in 
the pages of such generously communicative travel- 
lers and writers as Mr. Eraser. On an early page he 
assigns to Australia, in his largeness of heart and 
with a familiar disregard of syntax, an area " as 
big, or bigger, than all Europe," thus crediting the 
island with an excess of some eight hundred thou- 
sand square miles. Eifty-six excellent illustration* 
from photographs help the stranger to form correct 
conceptions of this land of splendid realities and 
still more splendid possibilities.

Mattachuitttt. Brown, & Co.), by Mr. George A. 
Torrey, who began the practice of his profession 
almost half a century ago in Fitchburg, Massachu- 
setts, and continued it later in Boston, becoming 
general counsel of the Fitchburg Railroad and trying 
cases in all but three of the counties in the State. 
His anecdotes of the bench and bar, from his own 
long and varied experience with courts and lawyers, 
are entertaining, and they bring into occasional 
near view such men of note as Judge Hoar, Senator 
Hoar, Mr. Richard Olney, and others. Even more 
interesting, for the average reader, are Mr. Torrey's 
reminiscences of his school and college days. He 
entered Harvard in 1855, under the benignant ad- 
ministration of President Walker and in the palmy 
days of Professors Felton, Peirce, Child, Cook, 
Lovering, and Bowen, all of whom he recalls by 
nickname. In his expressed conviction that the stu- 
dents of his time received a training such as is now 
no longer to be had, he but adopts the inevitable 
belief of all college men, that alma mater was in 
the full flush of her ripened charms during the four 
years they were in college, and that she has been 
falling off ever since. On an early page of his book 
the author assigns to his own church in Fitchburg 
the time-honored story of the very short preacher 
and the very high pulpit above which he managed, 
by standing on tip-toe, to show the top of his head as 
he piped forth his text, "It is I, be not afraid." 
How many other old-time churches claim to be the 
scene of this incident, we shall probably never know.

(Scribner). That the consorts of the doges must 
have exerted a real influence on Venetian policies 
and development is evident, though in rare case* 
only does this appear on the surface of the political

a social character : " the patronage and direction of 
charities of all kinds whether eleemosynary or 
educational, the maintenance of the Ducal hospitali- 
ties, the reception of ambassadors, the claims of the 
family, and the encouragement of arts and crafts." 
But these are activities that the annalist too often 
fails to record, and hence the story of the dogaressas 
is neither intensely interesting nor very instructive ; 
too often the account is limited to a name, a date or 
two, and a pedigree. Nevertheless, there is much 
in Mr. Staley's book that his readers will enjoy: 
pictures of Venetian life, both public and private; 
descriptions of odd customs and quaint ceremonial, 
of pageants, processions, athletic tournaments, and 
gorgeous funerals ; of household arts, particularly 
those of the boudoir. All this may be regarded as 
padding, but it is padding of a very pleasant sort. 
The work is, indeed, more a study of feminine life 
in Venice than a history of the ducal consorts ; it 
is as social history that it will prove most valuable. 
It is written in the author's easy, almost exuberant 
style, and is provided with a number of valuable 
illustrations.

and medicine. ern usa g eS) practices, and opinions, 
centering about the curing of physical ills by using 
the imagination which the mind naturally develops. 
He calls it " Primitive Psycho-Therapy and Quack- 
ery " (Houghton Mifflin Co. ) . What in primitive 
situations was the natural belief in the efficiency of 
procedures based on accredited systems of ideas, 
becomes in more illuminated periods the survival 
of quackery preying upon credulity. The large 
share of such quackery persisting to or revived 
in our own time and clime gives the necessary 
experience to make the older practices of one nature 
and kinship. Dr. Lawrence brings together a most 
varied collection, many of them from unusual 
sources, of the diverse methods of appeal to the 
faith in the desired cure, from amulets to blue-glass 
and magic formulae. It makes a curiously assorted 
string of beads, yet really united by the common 
thread of a mental influence acting upon a favorably 
disposed imagination ; and it leads to reflection 
upon the enduring traits of human nature, one of 
which was briefly commented upon by Puck, another 
by P. T. Barnum, and yet another by Lincoln. The 
degree of human folly, the human appetite for folly, 
and the futility of folly as a permanent prescription 
for all men on all occasions, all find pertinence in 
the long historical range of citations brought to- 
gether by this student of the by-ways of medicine 

and psychology. 

Dr. George M. Gould, whose thought- 
ful and thought-generating studies 
are by no means confined to the

The title is taken from the first chapter, which is

reprinted from " The Atlantic Monthly " of six years 
ago ; the other essays were also, with one exception, 
prepared originally for other purposes than book pub- 
lication. Taken together, they present, in an at- 
tractive and sufficiently systematic form, the deeper 
beliefs and higher ideals of a scholarly and reflective 
mind. Far from professing the skepticism or the 
agnosticism of the typical physician, Dr. Gould 
acknowledges a very positive belief, which, as we 
understand it, has a certain pantheistic tinge. The 
Infinite Presence is defined as " the living synthesis 
of all these characteristics of which we as partial 
incarnations present only facets." The limitations 
and "the failures, His mistakes or ours," of Dr. 
Gould's non-omnipotent deity are frankly acknowl- 
edged, although elsewhere in the book the terms 
" omnipotence " and " infinite of power " occur, but 
rather vaguely. The author makes the stellar uni- 
verse to be of limitless extent, whatever modern 
astronomy may have to say to the contrary. In spite 
of an occasional apparent or real self-contradiction, 
some repetition, and perhaps a little insufficiency of 
clearness and conciseness, the book is both worthy of 
a careful reading and is written in a style to insure it. 



BRIEFER MENTION. 



The crop of Baedekers revised for 1910 is now made 
to include " Belgium and Holland " (fifteenth edition), 
" Paris and Its Environs " (seventeenth edition), and 
" Berlin and Its Environs " (fourth edition). All are 
supplied with increased numbers of maps and plans. 
These books are imported by the Messrs. Scribner. 

The Justin Winsor historical prize essay for 1908, now 
published by the American Historical Association, is 
by Dr. Clarence Edwin Carter, who takes for his subject 
"Great Britain and the Illinois Country, 1763-1774." 
It is based upon much material heretofore unused, and 
constitutes a solid contribution to American scholarship 
in the historical field. 

The Cambridge University Press (Putnam) has 
completed its edition of "The Complete Works of 
George Gascoigne," edited by Professor John W. Cun- 
liffe, by the publication of the second volume. This 
volume of six hundred pages includes " The Glasse of 
Government," " The Princely Pleasures of Kenelworth 
Castle," " The Steele Glas," and many other pieces in 
prose and verse. 

Mrs. Neltje Blanchan's " The American Flower Gar- 
den " (Doubleday, Page & Co.), originally published in 
a sumptuous limited edition, is now reprinted in cheaper 
form, containing considerably fewer, though still a 
generous number of illustrations in color and half-tone. 
Mrs. Blanchan's book stands alone in its field, and the 
first edition was at once too small and too expensive to 
satisfy the popular demand. 

Professor Paul Shorey's college text of the Odes and 
Epodes of Horace, first published twelve years ago, has 
come into a new edition, the preparation of which has 
been shared by Professor Gordon J. Laing. The changes 
consist chiefly of added references to the recent litera- 
ture of the subject, and a slight curtailment of the

Sanborn & Co. are still the publishers of this extraordin- 
arily well-edited text. 

"A Guide to Reading in Social Ethics and Allied 
Subjects" is the title of a unique bibliography which 
has just been prepared through the cooperation of more 
than twenty teachers in Harvard University. Each 
instructor has contributed a list of the more noteworthy 
books in his special field, and in almost every case has 
added a brief criticism or analysis. Although the vol- 
ume is designed primarily for those engaged in social 
service, the general reader should find in it a useful 
guide to the best contemporary studies of social condi- 
tions and problems. 

'The Lure of the Antique" (Century Co.) is the 
attractive title of the latest book about old furniture. 
Some form of the antique allures almost everybody 
nowadays, and it is fnr these omnipresent amateur col- 
lectors that Mr. Walter A. Dyer has planned his 
treatise, which covers Colonial furniture, china, mirrors, 
candle-sticks, silver, pewter and glass ware, copper 
utensils, and clocks. Mr. Dyer urges the advantages 
of the Colonial period for American collectors, and of 
specialization in one field rather than dabbling in many 
and consequently accumulating a hodge-podge which 
is likely to include plenty of " fakes." How to dis- 
tinguish the false from the real is a matter to which 
he gives much attention. Another puzzling question 
for the inexperienced buyer is the financial one: how 
much to pay for the article you covet; what is a real 
bargain and what a fair price. Mr. Dyer finds a rather 
novel way of helping to solve this problem. His book is 
richly illustrated from photographs of typical antiques, 
and each one is given its approximate money-value. 
In the treatment of each subdivision of the subject the 
arrangement is chronological, with emphasis on the 
work of noted makers. 

Some time ago, Mrs. Bertha Feiring Tapper edited 
for the Musician's Library " of the Messrs. Ditson a 
volume of the " Larger Piano Compositions " of Edvard 
Grieg. She now gives us a companion volume of Grieg's 
" Piano Lyrics and Shorter Compositions," for which Mr. 
Samuel Swift has supplied a biographical aud descrip- 
tive introduction. The editor is herself a Norwegian, 
and consequently brings to her work of selection both 
understanding and sympathy. Eighteen opus numbers 
are represented, most of them by several pieces. Thus 
we have the gems of the ten books of " Lyrical Pieces," 
the Peer Gynt " numbers, many of the songs tran- 
scribed, and other exquisite selections. A sheaf of less 
pretentious musical publications from the same house

who brought out " The Garden of Allah," his greatest 
success. The new novel will be entitled " Dolores." 

" Arts and Decoration " is the title of a new monthly 
magazine to be devoted to art in relation to home- 
making. The periodical is issued by Adam Budge, 
Incorporated, of which Mr. Walter A. Johnson is presi- 
dent. The first issue of " Arts and Decoration" appears 
this month. 

The Harris Lectures for the current academic year 
at Northwestern University, Evanston, will be given 
from March 23 to March 28, 1911, by Professor 
Francis B. Gummere of Haverford College. The sub- 
ject of the series, which will be published later in book 
form, is " The Progress of Poetry." 

The new book by Professor G. Maspero, which the 
Appletons will soon publish, is entitled "Egypt: Ancient 
Sites and Modern Scenes." The volume is said to con- 
tain a collection of charming word pictures of Egypt, 
in which history and archaeology blend with the scenes 
of to-day, and the past is linked to the present. 

The books and autographs of Edmund Clarence 
Stedman, including unpublished letters and manuscripts 
from the Brownings, Swinburne, Aldrich, Bayard 
Taylor, Walt Whitman, Eugene Field, and others, will 
be sold at auction shortly by the Anderson Company of 
New York. The library of the late S. L. Clemens 
(Mark Twain) will also be sold by the same company. 

Some members of the bibliographical staff of " The 
Publishers' Weekly " office have been at work during 
the past summer on a classified directory of Private 
Libraries in the United States. Material for this prom- 
ising compilation has been gathered from muny sources, 
and it is planned to arnui^c it in thn-r alphabets. The 
first will be by names of collectors, with addresses and 
some mention of the collector's specialty ; the second 
will be geographical, by states and cities; the third, a

topical index, showing under each subject the names of 
all who have similar tastes. The little volume will 
probably not be ready before the end of the year, so 
that names of collectors not yet represented may be in- 
cluded if sent in during the present month. 

Under the title of The Great Illusion : A Study of 
the Relation of Military Power to Economic Ad- 
vantage," Messrs. G. P. Putnam's Sons will soon issue 
a considerably amplified edition of Mr. Norman Angell's 
notable pamphlet " Europe's Optical Illusion," which is 
regarded in Europe as the most notable contribution to 
a burning question that has appeared for many years. 

" English for Italians " is the title of a forthcoming 
book by Miss Edith Waller which teachers in Italian 
neighborhoods and social workers should find of consider- 
able usefulness. The William R. Jenkins Co., who will 
issue this book, also announce a French-English and 
English-French Dictionary, by Professor A. S. Collot 
of the University of Oxford, and " Forms for Analysis 
and Parsing " by Mr. A. E. Sharp. 

The Abbey Company, of Chicago, announce that they 
have acquired from Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. all rights 
in " The Abbey Classics." They will add to the series 
Whittier's " Snow-Bound," with a critical introduction 
by Mr. Walter Taylor Field. The Abbey Company 
also announce " A German Christmas Eve," the Christ- 
mas episode from Heinrich SeideFs " Leberecht 
Hiihnchen," translated by Miss Jane Hutchins White. 

The Lloyd Memorial Library, at Winnetka, 111., which 
was begun by the late Mrs. Henry Demarest Lloyd in 
memory of her husband, has been finished by her sons 
John and Henry D., and is now presented to the town 
as a memorial of both parents. About twenty-five thou- 
sand dollars has been spent on the handsome building, 
which, in accord with one of Mrs. Lloyd's provisions, has 
the novel feature of a combined club-room and smoking- 
room in the basement. 

Dr. Percy Louis Kaye has prepared for The Century 
Co. a volume of " Readings in Civil Government " to 
be used in schools as a companion to Mr. S. E. Forman's 
admirable " Advanced Civics." The readings are not 
for the most part documentary, but rather extracts 
from the writings of eminent publicists, all the way 
from Hamilton to Governor Woodrow Wilson. The 
selection is judicious and highly informing, and we could 
hardly imagine a book better fitted to supplement the 
ordinary text-book of this subject. 

" The Life and Times of the Right Honourable Cecil 
John Rhodes, 1853-1902 " is the title of the authorita- 
tive biography of the great builder of South Africa which 
is only about to appear eight years after Rhodes's 
death. The book is written by Sir Lewis Mitchell, of 
the Executive Council of Cape Colony, a trustee and 
executor of Rhodes's will and formerly his private sec- 
retary. It is a comprehensive work in two large 
volumes, and will be published about the middle of 
November by Mr. Mitchell Kennerley. 

During the past summer arrangements have been 
completed by which the Cambridge University Press 
assumes the British agency for the books and journals 
issued by the University of Chicago Press. The under- 
standing is that the Cambridge Press shall have ex- 
clusive right to the sale of these publications throughout 
the British Empire (including Egypt) in the eastern 
hemisphere. The connection thus formed between the 
newest of the great universities with one of the oldest, 
should be a matter for congratulation in both countries.

THE NEW EDITION 




PINNKK was held at riaridne's Hut*-] 
last night, by invitation of the Chan- 
cellor of the University of Canihi 
on the occasion of the undertaking 
by the University of the publication 
of the new (eleventh) edition of the 
" Encyclopaedia Britannica." The 
Chancellor (Lord Bayleigh) .presided, 
and among those present were the following officers 
of the University: 

The Vice Chancellor (Mr. Scott, the Master of St. 
John's), the representatives in Parliament (Messrs. 
Butcher and Rawlinson), the Master of Corpus Christi. 
the Master of Downing, the Master of Gonville, and 
Caius, the Provost of King's, the Master of Magda- 
lene, the Master of Pembroke, the Master of Peter 
house, the Master of St. Catherine's, the Master of 
Selwyn, Sir Clifford Allbutt, Sir Robert Ball, Sir 
George Darwin, Sir James Dewar, and Sir Joseph 
Larmor. , 

Among the other guests were the American Am- 
bassador, the Bishop of Ely, the Chancellor of the 
University of Manchester (Lord Morley), the Chan- 
cellor of the University of Aberdeen (Lord Strath- 
cona), Lord Gorell, Lord Justice Fletcher Mouiton, 
Lord Justice Buckley, Sir Alfred Lyall, Mr. Alfred 
Lyttleton, M.P.; the Vice-Chancellors of the Univer- 
sities of London, Manchester, Wales, and Glasgow, the 
Principal of the University of London, the editor (Mr. 
Chisholm) and staff of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 
the secretary (Mr. Wright) and staff of the Univer- 
sity Press, Sir William Crookes, Sir A. Geikie. the 
Hon. Arthur Elliot, the Hon. C. A. Parsons, Sir Har- 
old Harmsworth, Sir Ray Lankester, Sir Wm. Kam 
say, Mr. Moberly Bell, Mr. Edmund Gosse, Mr. Fred- 
eric Harrison, Professor Sedgwick, and Mr. Andrew 
Lang. 

The Chancellor, in proposing the toast of ' ' The 
King," announced that his Majesty had consents t<> 
accept the dedication of the new edition of the Ency- 
clopedia Britannica [cheers], and that the President 
of the United States had also accepted a similar iedi- 
cation. 

The President of the British Academy (Mr. -.11 
Butcher, M.P.) proposed the toast of the "Eney.-lo 
paedia Britannica." He said, in part, that the "En- 
cyclopaedia Britannica ' ' was a very remarkable book 
in its traditions. The first edition went back 140 
years, but the eleventh edition had now passed into the 
hands of the University of Cambridge. It was to come 
out in ti9 volumes; it had i!7,000 pages, 40,000 articles, 
and more than 1.500 contributors. These contributors 
were men of great distinction, not only in this coun- 
try, but all over the world; and with its India paper 



and some other of its physical characteristics, the 
weight of the 29 volumes was 30 Ibs., all the volumes 
being compressed into a space of about two feet. 
[Laughter and cheers.] How did this book come into 
existence? Who made it what it wast Who 
had created this new e<litionf It was more than 
a new edition; they might wiy that it had been 
"\\ritten as compared with the ninth or tenth edition : 
i ml the work was due to the editor, Mr. Chisholm, 
perhaps, also with the help of his assistant, Mr. Phil- 
ips. He had been silently at work on this edition for 
eight years, and had been able to produce an edition 
which wan a quite original thing in the history of en- 
cyclopedias. He had obtained the help of expert 
advisers, and through the aid of The Times had been 
able to establish relations with all the world. It 
seemed to him that there were two interesting and 
original features of this new edition. The first was 
that the book would be a complete and uniform whole. 
Through all these eight years the editor had kept 
all the parts of the book in relation one with the 
other. He had kept in touch with the contributors, 
and had made them know what the other collaborators 
were doing. He so set to work that the book received 
a structural unity of its own. This was the first novel 
feature of the "Encyclopaedia," because hitherto 
each volume had been a distinct and separate unit. 
Xow for the first time the book, though of immense 
variety, was a unit.' Hitherto there had been curi- 
ous inconsistencies and discordant articles intro 
into different volumes. They had this peculiar result 
from such an intellectual creation which had come 
into existence during an interval of fourteen or fifteen 
years. There was now an end of that irregularity, 
and this was a very great achievement. For the first 
time they had a real book, a book with structural 
unity, not a set of discordant monographs. 

The second characteristic of the new ' ' Encyclo- 
pa-dia" was that it kept pace with the forward move- 
ment and march of progress, and of the spirit of ex- 
pansion in every domain of knowledge. They were 
:i\\are that in the last thirty or forty years every 
form of knowledge had gone ahead at an extraor- 
dinary and accelerated rate, not only in the pi 

nc.es, but in humanistic science history, literature, 
an<l archaeology. In order, therefore, to bring this 
1 .ncyclopapdia ' ' up to date, it was necessary to 
revise the old one and even to rewrite it from the 
luxinning. The new book, therefore, was no longer 
a mere record of the past, bat it was to some extent 
in anticipation of future discoveries. It gave not only 
an insight into the past, luit it gave a foresight of 
the future, a spirit of progressiveness, and a display 
of the enlargement of all the boundaries of knowl

THE NEW EDITION 



edge. Surely, that was a splendid result to achieve, 
a splendid hope to have opened up? He observed in 
the list of contributors the names of writers belong- 
ing to the organized societies representing knowledge, 
some of the best men we had. There was, moreover, 
no limit of nationality in the selection of writers. 
Some of the 1,500 writers belonged to the Colonies, 
India, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, Hol- 
land, and even Japan. Those who had planned the 
book, therefore, and carried it through to completion, 
had done so inspired with the progressive spirit of 
science, having devoted to every branch of knowledge 
the kind of spirit which many would naturally feel 
might only belong to the more rapidly advancing 
forms of physical science. He believed that Cambridge 
was a fitting home for the new "Encyclopaedia." 
The University was a living organism; its roots were 
in the past ; it was a thing of gradual growth ; it 
looked on to-day and to-morrow; and its hopes 
stretched out into the future. He expressed the hope 
that by possessing and controlling such a book as this 
Cambridge might become more than it ever had in 
the past an inspiring center of world-wide intellec- 
tual life, and able to carry out not only its national 
but also its international function. [Cheers.] 

Mr. Hugh Chisholm, who was cordially greeted, 
while warmly thanking Mr. Butcher for the kind 
things he had said about him individually, insisted 
that it was in his representative rather than his per- 
sonal capacity that this very remarkable compliment 
was paid him. During the last seven or eight years 
he had been at the head of what had been really, 
though unrecognized by the world, a sort of college 
research, because he knew that the sort of book they 
wanted to bring out could not be made without it. 
An encyclopaedia was, of necessity, in a way, a coop- 
erative work, but the mere collecting of the work of 
a number of different distinguished authors did not 
make a work really cooperative. What they had done 
in the case of this particular edition was to make it 
really cooperative through the instrumentality of his 
editorial staff. It was universally recognized that the 
Ninth Edition, in spite of the faults that were due 
to the method of its compilation, was, on its merits, 
a very fine edition indeed, and he had certainly en- 
deavoured not to lower the ideals of Kobertson Smith 
and the editors of those days. The " Encyclopaedia 
Britannica" was never a mere reference book. The 
various editions of it had been among the actual 
sources through which progress had been attained, in 
the exposition of many important branches of knowl- 
edge, and they had attempted to maintain that tradi- 
tion in the present edition. But while keeping it an 
authoritative book and a collection of contributions 



from men who were making progress in all the sub- 
jects of knowledge, they had made it a very much 
better reference book than it was, and had given, he 
thought, a broader interpretation to the general prin- 
ciple. The ' ' Encyclopaedia Britannica ' ' long ago 
ceased to be purely Scottish, but it still remained in 
the Ninth Edition a predominantly and rather nar- 
rowly British book. It took an entirely British point 
of view in a great number of subjects. The phrase 
in some of its articles "in this country," meaning 
England, rather represented a certain mental attitude 
on the part of the contributors. The idea which ran 
through the whole of the new edition was that British 
interests were best served by giving the reader all the 
relevant information about any subject, whether it 
affected foreign countries or the homeland. Every 
single subject in the new edition was treated in what 
was really the only proper method, the comparative 
method. The book was not written purely for English- 
men, although his own feeling was that British inter- 
ests covered the whole world. The important thing 
was to give the English-speaking peoples an insight of 
what was going on in other countries. That was done 
in a capricious way in the Ninth Edition in the legal 
articles, but they carried out that principle in every 
sort of article in the new edition. He believed that 
Cambridge, by disseminating through all its educa- 
tional channels the contents of this book, would really 
be doing a great work to advance popular culture and 
to give a real impetus to the desire for accurate 
knowledge. 

The American Ambassador, in reply to the toast of 
"The Guests," with which his name was associated, 
said he thought there was a general consensus of 
opinion among the scholars of the world that the one 
Encyclopaedia to which they all looked for the most 
comprehensive, the most eomplete statement of facts 
relating to any particular subject, was the great 
"Encyclopaedia" with which they had to do that 
night. He thought, also, that there was very general 
satisfaction among the scholars of the world that this 
great work of reference was passing now from private 
control and from private editorship into the hands 
and under the responsibility of one of the two great 
Universities which for so many centuries had been the 
home of national, and perhaps he might venture to 
say, international scholarship. There was a certain 
satisfaction, too, in feeling that it had passed under 
the control of the University of Cambridge that one 
of the two great Universities which was popularly 
regarded at least as being specially given to scientific 
accuracy of investigation and to mathematical pre- 
cision of statement. Those were the very qualities 
for which they looked most of all in a book of rr-fer-

ence. A great scholar of Cambridge some centuries 
ago said that he proposed to take all knowledge as 
his province. The boundaries of human knowledge 
since that time had been enormously expanded, and 
no great son of Cambridge would now venture to say 
that he took all knowledge as his province. He might, 
perhaps, aspire to know everything about some one 
thing; he certainly could only hope after that to come 
op to what was an American definition of education 
to know something about everything. But the one 
great work to which they all did go if they wanted to 
know something about everything was the "Encyclo- 
pedia Britannica." Far be it from him to say that 
there was not a very large class of subjects on which 
American encyclopaedias were not better. He meant 
to say subjects in which Americans were specially 
interested. Perhaps to that extent their encyclopaedias 
were one-sided. He did believe, however, that it was 
the general judgment of the ttcholars and investiga- 
tors of the world that the one book to which they 
could go for the most complete, comprehensive, thor- 
ough and absolutely precise statements of fact upon 
every subject of human interest was the one for which 
the University of Cambridge was henceforth to be 
responsible to the world of letters. It was difficult 
to enhance the authority of the great work the Univer- 
sity had taken in charge. But if there was one thing 
which could be done to enhance its reputation they 
had done it. They had secured the authority to send 
it out to the world not only under their own imprima- 
tur, but bearing the great names of the two chief 
executives who divided between them the government 
of the he had almost said the undivided and indivisi- 



ble English-speaking race a race which was united 
in its history, united in its language, united in its 
pride, in the past, and united in its hopes and aspira- 
tions for the future. [Cheers.] 

The President of the Royal Society (Sir Archibald 
Qeikie) submitted the toast of "The University of 
Cambridge. ' ' 

The Chancellor (Lord Rayleigh), in reply, said that 
what, perhaps, came home to him most in connection 
with the new edition of the ' ' Encyclopaedia ' ' was the 
great advantage it would enjoy from the nearly simul- 
taneous publication of the various volumes. Many of 
them might remember the absurd results which might 
arise from piecemeal publication as given by, he 
believed, the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table. He 
described the case of a person who, having come across 
only one of the early volumes, knew everything about 
the Alps and the Andes, but hud never heard of the 
Himalayas or the Bocky Mountains. Continuing, the 
Chancellor said that his connection with the ' ' Ency- 
clopaedia Britannica" went back some little time. He 
knew the former editor, Dr. Robertson Smith, who 
said that if he wanted an article of a serious char- 
acter, inspired by wide and accurate knowledge, he 
generally looked for a Cambridge man as the author. 
It was implied, if not directly stated, that if he 
wanted a more general or ornamental treatment he 
might turn to the sister University. This was one of 
the matters in which, he thought, they might learn 
something from the sister University. At Cambridge 
they needed and were proud of their specialists, but 
even a specialist was none the worse for having com- 
mand of language and grace of style.

The Ne*iv York Times Book Review says: " Hcarn could not even get his manuscript read . . . but 
public and publishers have traveled far toward intellectual courage. The introduction by Hearn's biographer, 
Elizabeth Bisland, is a notable literary criticism, sympathetic, illuminative ... of the large, calm irony 
of its symbolism." 

Flaubert's great work could hardly have found a translator into English better fitted than Hearn by 
spiritual temperament, intellectual endowment, and acquired skill."

Why does an Englishman ever become a naturalized American ? 

(This story of Montana and of politics tells why Philip Danvers did.) 

The " local color" has, perhaps, not been squeezed from too many tubes of the days when the flotsam and 
jetsam of many nationalities ebbed and flowed across the international boundary between Montana Territory 
and what was then known as " The Whoop Up Country." From these various sources Montana drew some 
of her future statesmen. Montana's politicians have been exploited by others; but the characters in //;/'/ 
vigorous book are types never individuals.

" Now that he is dead and we shall never again hear that strange, penetrating, sympathetic voice, or catch

A Manual of Spiritual Fortification 



By LOUISE COLLIER WILLCOX. This collection of poems will prove of value from two separate points of 
view. In the first place, much of the deepest and sincerest religious feeling of the world has been expressed in 
purely secular verse. Secondly, the book is interesting historically, because it traces the progress of religious 
feeling, as distinguished from doctrinal, from the earliest period of English poetry down to the present. 16mo,

Mr. Jackson's novel is the best we have read for many a day 
an impressive, earnest study of an important American 
problem. Indianapolis News. 

A most tender little story, in which the author, with the 
delicate strokes of her accustomed art, has mingled humor 
and pathos with telling effect. The heart that can withstand 
her moving power is hard indeed. With a quaint and win- 
some simplicity, she has caught the issues of marriage and 
birth, in a touching tragi-comedy of mother-love.

Mr. McCutcheon's book on hunting big game in Africa is at once uniquely 
valuable and uniquely interesting. It is a significant narrative, packed with

is a notable contribution both to our knowledge of human nature and to our 
knowledge of natural history. Details are given for the guidance of any

Mr. William Dean Howells recently said that Brand Whit- 
lock's 13tb District is our best political novel. He also called 
attention to the fine literary skill, right literary method, and 
true literary ideal of his political short stories now collected 
under the striking title, The Gold Brick. 

The Native Born is the book of the hour in England. It has 
made a profound impression. The London Globe says : It is a 
real pleasure to be able to say of a new novelist that with his 
first novel he has achieved, if not greatness, the next best thing 
the right to be reckoned among the best of his contemporaries. 

We enthusiastically commend this work of fiction dealing 
with the strenuous yet ascending political life of the present. 
It is essentially big and vital. Terse, effectively humanized, 
replete with rapid action, this is a tale which men especially 
will admire and enjoy. Chicago Record-Herald.

Some Comments 

4 4 T^HIS rich, composite history of English literature is a real service to 

English scholarship. It presents us wtth the first adequate treatment 

of many neglected parts of our literary history, and it throws new 

light on many old themes. . . . The editors deserve all thanks, and the 

critic who feels inclined to quarrel with this point or that in their methods 

or conclusions will be humilated and silenced when he remembers that this 

is the first attempt by a body of scholars to tell the story of our literature on 

a scale worthy of its greatness." The Saturday Review. 

" A clear and convincing estimate, and one in which everything that is of 
outstanding significance is skillfully disentangled from the vast mass of 
subsidiary clues to interpretation. It seems to us that this is the supreme 
merit of the volume, the discrimination and judgment with which it brings 
to a focus the gradual evolution of a language and the wonderful outburst 
of creative achievement in letters under the Tudors." London Standard.

HOW TO REACH THE BOOK BUYERS 

The publisher's problem at this season 
is to reach the scattered thousands 
who buy books for Christmas. The 
best medium for the purpose is a 
newspaper that caters to such people 
by printing daily book reviews the 
year around. The only paper that 
does this in the middle West is 

THE CHICAGO RECORD-HERALD 

The favorite paper of book lovers. 
Since its reduction to one cent in 
Chicago and suburbs The Record- 
Herald has doubled its city circulation. 
This makes it more effective than 
ever for publishers' advertising a 
splendid opportunity to reach a great 
public. Test it and see.

TOLSTOY. 

The great Russian moralist who died ten days 
ago reached the venerable age of Goethe, and 
was as distinctly as Goethe the most command- 
ing figure in the whole world of contemporary 
letters. With Tolstoy the last of the nineteenth 
century giants has departed, although the twen- 
tieth century has run but a single decade of its 
course. Swift's epitaph might serve for him, 
for he has found rest ubi sceva indignatio ulte- 
rius cor lacerare nequit ; his torn and indig- 
nant spirit could no longer bear to live among a 
people fast lapsing into barbarism, a people that 
has wellnigh forfeited all claim to be reckoned 
among the civilized communities. Pathos un- 
utterable and spiritual tragedy are mingled in 
the story of those closing days in which he went 
forth into the solitudes to draw his final breath. 
Like Lear, he was driven out into the storm, 
and wandered distracted over the heath. He 
would not have relished the comparison, because 
he was blind to the splendor of that fictive 
counterpart of his own perplexed soul, but those 



446 



THE DIAL 



[Deo. 1, 



who were gathered about him at the end might 
well have murmured, u Vex not his ghost ! " as 
he passed into the valley of the shadow. 

In the happenings of recent years in Russia, 
its stifling of every aspiration toward freedom, 
its bloody orgies of administrative revenge, its 
foul perfidy revealed in the rape of Finland, 
there may be found ample cause for the gloom 
that enfolded Tolstoy's soul in the evil days 
upon which he had fallen ; yet could he have 
realized to the full his world-wide influence for 
good, some light might have found its way into 
his darkness. For he was, despite the seeming 
moral inertia of his environment, the most 
effective preacher of his time ; his voice stirred 
the deeps of many waters that appeared stag- 
nant, and its vibrations thrilled responsive 
hearts the world over. It was not by argument 
that he prevailed, but by direct appeal to the 
saving instinctive elements of the human con- 
sciousness. His reasoning was often childish, 
but his moral passion was overwhelming in its 
force. Thus, one need not accept the Tol- 
stoyan conclusions to be a Tolstoy an in spirit, 
and those who upon purely intellectual grounds 
must maintain the attitude of antagonism may 
without shame pay the tribute of reverence to 
his whole-souled sincerity. His essential service 
was to persuade men to go straight to the heart 
.of the fundamental problems of life, to strip 
them of their wrappings of custom and preju- 
dice and tradition, and to solve them in the 
terms of an all-embracing human sympathy. 

The key to all these problems, Tolstoy held, 
was to be found in the gospels. He believed 
that Christianity the literal teaching of its 
Founder was workable. He saw clearly 
enough that it had not worked hitherto, and 
that the poet's despairing cry was only too well 
justified by the historical record. 

" The nineteenth wave of the ages rolls 

Now deathward since thy death and birth. 
Hast tliou fed full men's starved -out souls ? 
Hast thou brought freedom upon earth ? 
Or are there less oppressions done 
In this wild world under the sun ? " 

One may make a comparison between literal 
Christian teaching and the literal text of the 
Constitution of the United States ; just as the 
latter has been made into a working instrument 
by a long line of decisions of the Supreme 
Court, so the former has been given practical 
expression as a guide of conduct by the glosses 
of ecclesiastical tribunals, has been fashioned 
into an effective system by the opportunism of 
the Church which stands as its visible and offi- 
cial embodiment. Now just as there are those 



who claim that <>ur political salvation lies in a 
recurrence to the fundamental principles of 
civil liberty as set forth in tlu- Constitution 
and the Declaration, so there are those who 
believe that in the New Testament, strictly 
interpreted, may be found a panacea for all the 
ills of modern society. Tolstoy was of those 
who shared this belief, and it never found a 
more appealing and eloquent champion. Was 
his light a marsh-fire or a beacon? We may 
do no more than put the question. The subject 
is immensely complex and infinitely debatable. 
He, at least, had no doubts, and his faith has 
powerfully influenced many wavering souls. 

The voice is stilled, but the record remains. 
It is a record assailable by logic at many points. 
It is weakened by inconsistency and paradox, by 
touches of mysticism and fanaticism, by a 
repudiation of many of the real conquests of 
civilization, and by an almost incredible lack 
of the historical sense. Its method is that of 
didacticism rather than of art, forgetful of the 
eternal truth : 

" Tout passe. L'art robuste 
Seul a F 4terniU$." 

But it is all aflame with the passion of the 
prophet, and its accents have a resonance that 
the echoes will prolong. Yet we cannot help 
feeling that his power would have been more 
lasting, and his influence exerted in ways subtler 
but ultimately more effective, had he not, mid- 
way in his career, allowed the exhorter in him 
to get the better of the artist, yielding to the 
emotional stress. of his overwrought soul. Des- 
pite the temptation to speak only words of praise 
in this hour when the world mourns the loss of 
one of its greatest and best, we are yet con- 
strained to repeat our words of twelve years 
ago, written upon the occasion of his seventieth 
birthday. 

" When his living personality shall have passed from 
the view of men, when his tracts and his parables and 
his religious polemics shall have taken their place in 
the intellectual lumber-room which contains the vagaries 
of great souls gone astray, when his autobiographical 
writings shall be valued only as curious revelations of a 
mind out of joint, he will be remembered and admired 
and extolled as the author of ' War and Peace,' that epic 
of the Russian people in the most tragic hour of its con- 
sciousness; of ' Anna Kare'uiua,' that sincere and poig- 
nant portrayal of a group of intensely limn m souls; by 
the slighter and earlier sketches of the Crimean War 
and the Cossacks and the Caucasus that exhibit in some 
respects a finer an than the two colossal productions by 
which he is best known. . . . Men will smile at the 
color-blindness of his esthetic writings, and at the pathe- 
tic lack of the historic sense so characteristic of his social 
and religious philosophy, l>iit they will luivcmily respect 
and wonder for his achievements during the years before 
he set about the hopeless task of reforming the world."

THE LANDSCAPE PAINTER IN LIFE 
AND LITERATURE. 



If pure happiness can fall to man it must 
surely be the lot of the Landscape Painter. He 
realizes Spenser's ideal, and enjoys delight with 
liberty. He is the real Aladdin, with the Lamp 
in his color- box. This makes him master of the 
world. From it he can evoke forests and 
streams, palaces with rich domains, cottages 
where tranquility abides. Only perhaps his 
genie does not always rise to his bidding with 
huge silver salvers laden with dishes or smok- 
ing with rich viands. But perish such low, 
material gratifications ! Even if house rent is 
lacking he is so free of nature that he ought to 
be able to lodge in a tree, like the French poet, 
" third branch to the right." 

The greatest of men have been tramps, 
Homer, Socrates, Dante, Cervantes, the founders 
of religious orders, not to speak of more sacred 
names still. Some of these their fellow-beings 
have imprisoned or hanged in order, I suppose, 
to give them gome visible means of support. 
The Landscape Painter's business is to tramp, 
to explore nature, to be blown about by breezes 
on the heights, to burrow into the valleys, to eat 
his noonday bite by curling brooks, to bivouac 
if need be on bedded leaves, to be of kin to 
beasts and birds and butterflies, to say to the 
ass, like St. Francis, " My Brother"; and when 
he has won the wise and healthy secrets of these 
things to bring them back to man in his crowded 
city dens as restoratives and inspirations. 

What a life is his! Perhaps, like the lower 
order of tramps, Winter may drive him into 
city quarters ; but when Spring breathes its 
first enchantment over the land he is out again 
where real existence is possible. He goes be- 
fore the Gypsies and takes the winds of March 
with his beauty, if he has any. He hunts out the 
likeliest and loveliest localities, and is the real 
advance guard of the great army of summer 
boarders which follows where he leads. He is 
always Dr. Syntax in search of the picturesque. 
Perhaps nearly every attractive Summer resort 
in this country has been first discovered and ex- 
ploited by artists. The quaint and natural in 
human life appeal to him as much as landscape 
splendors, and he is the real leader of revolt 
against the artificial and sybaritic existence of 
the rich. It is the artist who discovers those 
delicious villages where life is lived as in a 
world remote or a forgotten century ; or those 
individual inns which stand out in the memory 
like red letters in a missal. He is usually so 



simple in his tastes that he melts into this life as 
water does in water. The man of letters counter- 
feits all these tastes and traits, and because words 
are more portable and fly about the world easier 
than pictures he gets the credit for these returns 
to nature, but the artist is the man. 

However, business is business. The Land- 
scape Painter is not out primarily for his health, 
or to gratify his instincts for the quaint, the 
charming, or the unexpected. He is bent on 
the conquest of the outer world. It is for him 
to over-run nature as Alexander or Napoleon 
did the empires of man, and to put the stamp 
of his mind on the scenes he recreates. Some- 
times he makes a march to Moscow, but 
oftener he conquers and gives almost as much 
as he receives. For while he cannot compete 
with nature in details, while he cannot begin 
with his pigments to rival the infinite delicacies 
or splendors of form and color in the actual 
world, he can group and arrange these things 
better, or at least more significantly, than Na- 
ture. Nature, like Cromwell, is careless of the 
warts ; but the artist can eliminate, thrust back, 
bring forward, soften or make vivid any part 
of the scenes he paints, and can transform the 
most commonplace of these into something which 
resembles the portals of Fairyland. Sermons, 
in stones, books in the running brooks, are also 
in his line, and he can throw over Nature what- 
ever he possesses himself of gaiety or melan- 
choly, he can add to it a tragic grandeur, and 
cast upon it the reflection of human fate. 

To struggle with the problems of light and 
shade, of projection and distance ; to deal with 
the sky as a great drop-curtain which rises and 
falls on the scenes of the world ; to realize the 
clouds which build up their architecture of 
domes and towers, throwing shadows upon each 
other or upon the earth beneath as they sweep 
over it; to handle some frond of foliage where* 
half the leaves are like little mirrors reflecting 
the light of the sun and the other half are 
intricately confused in their own forms by the 
shadow of their neighbors ; to paint the forest 
depths where rays of light are like visitation of 
angels and gild what they touch with floating 
gold ; to reproduce that visionary light which at 
sunrise or sunset bridges the sky in an instant, 
and falling at one's feet turns the most ordinary 
objects to appurtenances of the Age of Gold ; 
to re-create the mystery of twilight when dusk 
gathers in the trees and night creeps close to 
earth's bosom, while above, as day departs, 
the moon's bowl fills, the moon's bowl glows, 
and with it all the starry chalices; to reveal

the -lani'ir <>f tin- tinnm's ton-lies as they MIOVC 
below, en tangled in boughs and bushes or march- 
ing in broad procession along avenues embanked 
in shade ; to give permanency to Spring's half 
nude graces, or Summer's rich pomp, or Au- 
tumn's wistful but glorious fading, or Winter's 
sculpturesque outlines, these are the labors 
and the delights of the Landscape Painter. 

And when he returns to his city studio, 
room so unlike all others, a chamber by night, 
a working place by day, strewn with implements 
of his craft, and with cooking conveniences in 
a corner, when he returns here what sheaves 
he brings with him, what rich spoils of con- 
quest! That his pictures are unsalable is of 
little import. A man cannot have everything. 
He cannot get heaven and have rosewood fur- 
niture and velvet carpets at the same time. He 
may not even have accumulated a wife and 
children, but he has espoused the day and 
begotten the stars. 

Literature has been strangely neglectful of 
the Landscape Painter. It has an affection for 
huffing heroes and people of action, captains 
and men-at-arms. When it turns to the arts at 
all for characters it takes up with its own kind. 
And it must be admitted that literary men are 
better fun than their gentler brothers of the 
brush, that their wits are brighter, their 
lives more interesting, that they deal more in 
love affairs, have more wives, and so become 
generally dear and delightful. Even literature 
incarnate in George Sand, who devastated all the 
other arts and sciences by her conquests, disdained 
having an affair with a landscape painter. 

I can recall no great literary creation of this 
profession. Poets, novelists, actors, figure and 
flourish in fiction. Thackeray even gives us that 
great artist of sauces, M. Alcide de Mirobolant. 
But the painter is forgotten. The dramatists 
of course have no use for him. I think the 
only occasion on which he appears in person in 
Shakespeare is the brief satirical glimpse of 
the portrait painter in "Timon of Athens." 
Molidre, who painted and satirized all other 
kinds of men, left the artist out though he 
must have known the Court painters of Louis 
XIV. Goethe, too, although he struggled hard 
to become an artist himself, did not devote any 
creative effort to bodying forth one of the craft. 
He drew poets, actors, even landscape gardeners, 
but the man of the brush he ignored. The epic 
and narrative poets also ignore him. Antiquity 
simply does not know that he exists. Dante 
devotes two lines to Giotto and Cimalme. 
Milton, Dryden, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley. 



Keats, Hugo, what have any of them done for 
the painter? Tennyson has his Lord of Bur- 
leigh, with the slighting " He was but a Land- 
scape Painter. ' Browning alone gives us some 
adequate sketches of artists, of which the one 
depicting the tortured soul of Andrea del Sarto 
is the greatest. 

The novelists are a little better. Rousseau's 
St. Prieux was an artist. That tame specimen 
of the genus homo, Waverley, sketched ; as did 
Colonel Mannering. The hero of "St. Ronan's 
Well " has a false glamor thrown over him by 
the imputation that he is an illustrious artist. 
Charles Reade's Triplet, being capable of all, 
might probably have painted landscapes, hut 
there is no record that he did. There is no artist, 
I think, in Jane Austen s books. Charlotte 
Bronte makes Jane Eyre a landscapist, and a 
wonderful one if the description of tin- sketches 
she shows Rochester is exact. Mrs. Humphry 
Ward starts one of her heroes as a landscape 
painter, but she soon involves him in that web 
of fine folk and important affaii-s which she 
delights to weave and which has no possible 
human interest. Thackeray, half artist him- 
self, did little to bring the painter into the 
realm of literature, though Clive Newcome dot s 
make a valiant attempt at art ; and Dickens did 
less, though Alfred Jingle could paint. Truly, 
printer's ink has not been wasted on the artist. 
The best creation of the kind I can think of in 
literature is the Scotch hutdscapist in William 
Black's " Shandon Bells." He is worth more 
than any figure in " Trilby,' though the latter 
is doubtless the most important piece of liter- 
ature which is all about artists. Its instant 
acceptance showed that the world was hungry 
for knowledge of the habits and manners of 
these little-known animals. 

History and biography of course come to the 
rescue of the artists, though even here they get 
much less than their just proportion of attention. 
Vasari's u Lives " are comparatively full and 
fairly attractive, but we get little about the jolly, 
rollicking Dutch artists, and only dry scraps in 
regard to the French and Spanish men. There 
are no art biographies, I believe, that can com- 
pare in affectionate labor and rich detail with 
a score of literary memoirs. 

Something has been made up to the artists 
by the great critics. Fronton tin. Rusk in, Meier- 
Graefe, and others have given to the works of 
the great painters a profound analysis and 
splendid praise. Kuskin is rather under a cloud 
with the artists at present, though they ought 
to sacrifice a hecatomb to him every year. He

opened the eyes of the great mass of English 
readers, taught them that the Earth was some- 
thing more than a place to plant potatoes in, 
and that the chamber of the air served other 
uses than that of respiration. And he made 
the art which reported these other purposes of 
Nature respectable and popular. His criticism 
erred in a hundred particulars. He was half 
wrong in his central principle that great art is 
the praise of God, it is just as often the 
praise of the Devil, or at least an uncriticizing 
exhibition of him. He was totally wrong in 
his insistence on actual truth in painting, in 
demanding that things be painted as they are 
rather than as they seem. He was largely wrong 
in both his apotheosis of Turner and his depre- 
ciation of Whistler. But when all is said and 
done, there is a great balance of right thinking 
and teaching to his credit. 

Literature and painting are the most closely 
allied of the arts. The domain of literature is 
immeasurably the wider, that of painting the 
more definitely realized. The trouble with paint- 
ing is this : it is not and cannot be known ex- 
cept to a few. Black and white or colored repro- 
ductions do something to spread a knowledge 
of it, but these do not give the real vision of the 
artist ; whereas a book repeats exactly to the 
reader what the writer created. It is perhaps 
this comparative secrecy and seclusion of the 
artist's work that accounts for his little promi- 
nence either in the real world or the literary 

report of it. ~ 

CHARLES LEONARD MOORE. 



TOLSTOY'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THE 
WOMAN PROBLEM. 

"That remarkable piece of stupidity which is 
called the rights of women," is the great Russian 
iconoclast's summary of the modern woman's insist- 
ent demand for the right of self-expression in all 
fields of endeavor. That remarkable revolt against 
tradition and established ethical and moral laws, 
the book that epitomizes his revolutionary tenets, 
" What to Do," deals uncompromisingly with the 
woman problem. From the point of view of the 
most Russian of all the Russians a man who has 
not been out of his own country in fifty years 
Tolstoy shows a keen appreciation of woman's status 
in the world. He is guided chiefly by the eternal 
verities. He exalts motherhood, and maintains that 
woman can be dominant only through her power to 
effect the salvation of man. He says : "As stated 
in the Bible, a law was given to the man and the 
woman. to the man, the law of labor ; to the 
woman, the law of bearing children. Although we, 
with our science, avons chang& tout $a, the law for 



the man, as for the woman, remains unalterable." 
Why should this credo, the outcome of his demand 
that we base all our actions on the most primitive 
interpretation of the law of brotherly love, seem 
reactionary ? In trying to lift what he considers 
the burden of twenty centuries of so-called civili- 
zation and progress from the shoulders of suffering 
humanity, Tolstoy sees only one path to right living: 
a return to primitive social conditions. But he re- 
conciles us to his stern demands by pointing out the 
wide, almost unlimited, scope of woman's work and 
influence: "Women form public opinion, and 
women are especially powerful in our day." These 
two expressions would seem to give the antipodal 
points in his attitude toward woman's emancipation. 
From both points of view, he places woman on an 
exalted plane. And yet we are constrained to voice 
some doubts. Will a return to the patriarchal condi- 
tions which he lauds as conducive to greater human 
happiness produce a loftier ideal of the marital 
union ? Does a realization of his ideal regarding 
woman's sphere and influence mean a denial of the 
ultra-modern woman'sdemands in their highest sense ? 
Countess Tolstoy's reference to her own position 
is singularly suggestive. ' When I married Count 
Tolstoy, I had modest ideas : that is, I was willing 
to be second ; he made me advance to first place. 
Since then he has desired to make me third. Eh 
bien non! I shall hold to second." In his own 
life, Tolstoy has been true to his championship of the 
old-time ideal of woman's position in the conjugal 
relation. He and his wife have always enjoyed 
the higher sense of companioni-hip that is the result 
of perfect harmony and broad intellectual sym- 
pathy and understanding. The Countess Tolstoy 
is a woman of high intellectual attainments. She 
has never favored the aggressive measnres of her 
modern sisters, probably because she finds that she 
has all the rights she can do justice to. Until her 
daughters were old enough to assume that duty, she 
was her husband's amanuensis ; ai.d she has always 
been the guardian angel who has protected him 
from the evil that might result in some cases from 
the extreme application of his theories. " In her 
conduct and bearing toward her husband and his 
literary productions," says her brother, Mr. Behrs, 
" she always reminds me of a religious worshipper 
and zealous guardian of some sacred fount." 

Tolstoy has always been deeply convinced of the 
mission of women as teachers. It is to be deplored 
that his own schools, in which his wife and daughters 
supervised the splendid work done, could not stand 
against Russian immutability. His aim to reform 
men, not methods, had some chance of realization 
in his own and his family's attempts to train young 
minds in the way they should go. His ideal of 
human fellowship and service could hardly be more 
practically applied than in his repeated admonitions 
to mothers as the pillars of the world's moral found- 
ation. He censures the modern tendency toward over- 
indulgence, with its consequent weakening effect; 
and he fears for the future of the race when he

warns us against " bolstering up this delusive life 
of ours with the aid of our science and art." Wuinan, 
the altruistic half of humanity, should know no 
higher mission than to lead toward the realization 
of man's highest endeavors. 

It is liard to reconcile this conception of woman's 
rights with her demands, in this dynamic age. We 
must not forget that Tola toy repudiates all force, all 
oaths of allegiance, and every social institution. 
Woman's aggressive measures for the attainment 
of what she deems her rights would come under his 
ban as being coercive. Militant suffrage he thinks 
abominable. How would a man of Tolstoy's con- 
victions meet the argument of the eminent French- 
woman of revolutionary fame, who demanded equal 
suffrage on the plea that a woman should have the 
right to mount the platform as long as she is con- 
ceded the right to mount the guillotine? According 
to Tolstoy, no human being is free so long as anyone 
has the right to sanction or forbid that person's 
actions by threatening violence. 

Those of Tolstoy's heroines who strike the right 
balance between head and heart in dealing with the 
problems of life are often a negative embodiment 
of his ideal woman. He places the blame for many 
wrecked lives on the prevailing false standards of 
social purity and conjugal honor. The " Kreutzer 
Sonata" has evoked the anathemas of many who 
could not sanction its moral perversities, and its 
author has been accused of having brought about a 
most dangerous unsettling of our moral and ethical 
codes. So far as the book's influence on immature 
minds is concerned, its jarring exaggerations and 
repulsive details reveal little more to them than 
abnormalities of the untamed Slav temperament. 
There are brutal biological facts and ugly truths 
that Tolstoy tells unflinchingly, and they see only 
these from their myopic viewpoint But the motive 
of the book is not a reversion of the moral code ; it 
is a much-needed arraignment of the causes that are 
responsible for much of the world's conjugal misery. 
Translated into action, the " Kreutzer Sonata'' would 
bring about social chaos. As a preachment from 
one of those fanatics of to-day who become the pro- 
phets of to-morrow, it must be regarded as holding 
the germ of a theory that leads in the right direction. 

George Meredith, that master interpreter of 
"the eternal feminine," called Anna Karenina the 
grandest woman in the whole range of fiction. Let 
us see how the heroine in this tragedy of a sinful 
love reflects what her creator demands as a woman's 
inalienable right, "not the support of social con- 
ventions but the laws of her own being," in the 
words of the most modern champion of her sex, 
Ellen Key. Anna's character reflects what the 
author has gained in sympathy and understanding, 
as does each of the women in his later works. Shortly 
after the publication of " Anna Karenina," Tolstoy 
astonished the world by his remarkable change of 
attitude toward the masterpieces that had raised 
him to the pinnacle of success. The subsequent 
volumes of religious essays and philosophical con- 



fessions contain comparatively few allusion* to 
woman and her sphere, except in his gem-ial ad- 
monitions to mankind to strive after the Nazarene 
ideal as applied to creed, to man's duty to his f t How- 
man, to his country, and, not least of all, to woman's 
place and work in the world. His denunciatory 
words first quoted a* referring to modern suffrage 
are so comprehensive as to need little elucidation, 
other than that contained in his creed. Not long 
ago, Sonia Rubenstein, a little girl living in Kief, 
asked Tolstoy if there is a God in Heaven. His 
reply embodies the fundamental idea in hi* philo- 
sophy of life: "God is not in heaven. He dwells 
within each of us. God is what gives life to all 
living things. We only know God through love. 
God's whole law is that we love Him and our neigh- 
bor. The greatest happiness in the world is to love 
all." In " Anna Karenina," he urges a higher idea) 
of the marriage relation, based on a higher standard 
of social ethics. Divorce is never justifiable in his 
eyes. Our American institution of rapid and easy 
release from galling marital bonds he considers the 
appalling outcome of woman's clamor for equal i -itjlu> 
and of a growing deterioration in domestic life. 
From his contention in the " Kreutzer Sonata," that 
most modern marriages are sinful, it would naturally 
follow that he considers an indissoluble union a fit 
punishment for the sin committed. 

In urging the right to a regenerated life through 
redemption from sin, Tolstoy preaches a magnifi- 
cent sermon in the tragedy called " Resurrection." 
Manlova, the fallen woman, is as sympathetically 
portrayed as the mysterious Madame X " of the 
French dramatist, who recently moved two contin- 
ents to tears. Both authors plead for a right that 
an unjust moral law denies the woman and grants 
to the man. Tolstoy demands sympathy, personal 
service, and the merging of one's personality, as the 
only acceptable aid we can give to sinm r-. 

Browning's noble words, " Trust God : see all, 
nor be afraid ! " might serve as a beaeon-light 
through the awful labyrinth of sin and degradation 
as revealed in "The Power of Darkness." Its 
revolting realism would l>e utterly disheartening, 
were it not for the author's powers of divination in 
showing the spark of eternal fire through the dross. 
These low degenerate human beings are pioducts of 
Russian civilization, which produces criminals of a 
type of perversity strange to occidental minds. That 
he arouses even a trace of pity for them, is an 
eloquent tribute to his genius and his sincerity. 
Our occidental point of view, and many incoiiM-t- 
encies in the application of Tolstoy's theories, together 
with our lack of understanding of the forces at work 
in a benighted country like Russia, make a woman 
such as Nikita's mother appear like some hideous 
uu-human creature from a nether world. And yet, 
does not the history of crime in our own country 
offer parallel cases?

trodden men or women. The chief aim of the 
association seems moderate in scope : to agitate for 
the modification of Premier Stolypin's land act, 
with the ultimate aim of enabling women to join in 
the land-purchase scheme and to become land- 
owners. Had Tolstoy lived, it is not impossible that 
his wide influence and undoubted sincerity despite 
his inconsistencies would have been thrown in 
favor of these progressive measures. He has shown 
that true advancement is not necessarily a departure 
from tradition, nor an under-mining of time-hallowed 
rights and privileges. After all, his Utopia has 
more of the right spirit of modernity than some of 
its most enthusiastic disciples might be willing to

CASUAL COMMENT. 



A FORGOTTEN AMERICAN POET is pleasantly re- 
called in one of the chapters of the just-published 
Stedman "autobiographic biography." When Mr. 
John Lane, the publifher, made a visit to this 
country about ten years ago, be was filled with 
enthusiasm for a new poet, Mr. Stephen Phillips, 
to wit, whose early works he had then recently 
produced. Calling one day upon Edmund Clarence 
Stedman, he enlarged upon the subject, and wished 
particularly to note the originality of the themes 
chosen by Mr. Phillips. There was the tale of 
Paolo and Francesca, he said, that no other modern 
had thought of making into a tragedy, whereupon 
Mr. Stedman turned to his shelves and took down 
the familiar (to American readers) work of George 
H. Boker. This was a setback, but Mr. Lane 
rallied, and said that at least no other poet had hit 
upon such a subject as " Christ in Hades." Where- 
upon Mr. Stedman again turned to his shelves, and 
took down a volume of poetry with that identical title. 
It was not easy to catch Mr. Stedman napping upon 
a matter of the history of American poetry. The 
poem in question was the work of William Wilber- 
force Lord, who was born in 1819, and who died 
not long ago when wellnigh a nonogenarian. This 
generation has completely forgotten him, but in his 
time he attracted marked attention,earning the praise 
of Wordsworth, and incurring the censure of Poe. 
He published three volumes between 1845 and 1856. 
In the new Stedman biography occurs the follow- 
ing passage, dated 1850, when the writer was a boy 
of sixteen. " Mr. Lord went over to N. York with 
me the morning you sailed. I admire him, from 
the bottom of my heart. I have, with great diffi- 
culty (they are so little known) procured a copy of 
his poems, and am lost in ecstasy and wonder at 
the sublimity of his ' Niagara' the calm and holy 
and grand philosophy of his ' Worship,' and the 
majesty and elegance of his ' Ode to England ' . . . 
What an intellect he has ! Will this be my fate 
to be forgotten and unknown ? " It is safe to say 
that Lord has not become better known during the 
sixty years that have elapsed since he received this 



tribute of boyish admiration. But Mr. Stedman was 
loyal to the last, holding Lord to have been the most 
Miltonic of American poets, and only a year before 
his death expressed this opinion in a conversation 
with the present writer, adding that one of the 
things he most hoped to find time and strength to 
do was to prepare a critical essay upon Lord's 
work. The essay, we fear, had to be left unwritten, 
but its subject remains, and possibly some one else 
may become minded to undertake the task which 
was thus left unperformed. 

A MASTER OF SUBTLE EFFECTS, both as painter 
and as writer, John La Farge, who died recently 
at the ripe age of seventy-five, will long be remem- 
bered for his passionate devotion to the mistress 
(Art) whom he so nobly served, for his insatiate 
thirst after ever new knowledge, his reverence for 
all that is venerable and sacred in the past, and his 
quick detection and dexterous exposure of much 
that is neither venerable nor sacred in the present. 
In literature he is known for his " Artist's Letters 
from Japan," his ' Artist and Writer : Lectures on 
Art," and those papers on the old masters and the 
Barbizon School of painters that have lately been 
collected in two volumes. A posthumous issue of 
tho*e autobiographical or retrospective notes that 
he is thought to have left behind him in some drawer 
or pigeon-hole of his de>k, is to be hoped for. French 
by descent and American by birth, he presented in 
his person a rare combination of notable qualities. 
His old friend and co-eval, Mr. Elihu Vedder, writes 
admiringly of him in ' The Digressions of V." 
" La Farge was inspiring," he declares ; " I have 
never met anyone more so." And further : " This 
quality of subtlety is shown in those never-to-be- 
forgotten flowers, particularly in that damp mass of 
violets in a shallow dish on a window-sill, where the 
outside air faintly stirring the lace curtains seems 
to waft the odour towards you. This quality, pecu- 
liarly his own, affects me in his writings, so that as 
a writer I was at one time inclined to find fault 
with him for a certain elaborate obscurity in his 
style, which I now see arises from his striving to 
express shades of thought so delicate that they seem 

to render words almost useless."

word concerning the man of letters, the poet of so 
fair early promise, the biographer of so noteworthy 
later achievement, was spoken by President Emeritus

kindly adviser. "Those of an who knew him best," 
said Dr. Angell, "looked for a distinctly literary 
career for him. We experienced a serious disap- 
pointment when we saw that events were turning 
him in a diffe rent direction." And from Mr. Root's 
speech this passage is noteworthy : " It would be 
difficult to conceive of a sharper contrast than 
between the character of Mr. Hay and the confident, 
thick-skinned, self-assertive, pushing, hustling char- 
acter ordinarily associated with success in the 
practical affairs of this hurly-burly world." The 
memorial building is a fine example of library 
architecture, dignified without and admirably adapt- 
ed to its uses within. It stands easily first among 
college and university library buildings in New 
England. ...

on hearing him mentioned now, to find still alive 
and active. It was as long ago as 1873 that his

fame as poet, playwright, and novelet-writer, was 
secure. He was born in Berlin on the 15th of March, 
1830, and the plaudits over his achievement of his 
eightieth birthday had hardly subsided when there 
came the report of this crowning honor of his long 
literary lifc. Thirty and more volumes are required 
to contain his collected works, and bis fellow- 
countrymen's estimate of their quality is evident 
from the tone of admiration and veneration in which 
he and his writings are mentioned throughout Ger- 
many. Whatever his unquestioned merits in other 
and more important fields of literature, his facility 
and artistry in the short novel, or long short-story, 
have won him a wide reading and an enviable fame.

AN ANNUAL REMINDER OF THE SWIFT LAPSE OF 

TIME comes to us this month in the Almanac for the 
new year HO close at hand. Still foremost among 
our favorites in the literature of this description 
stands "The Old Farmer's Almanac" founded by 
Robert B. Thomas, of honored memory, in 1793. 
The issue for 1911 is, consequently, the one hun- 
dred and nineteenth consecutive number of this 
venerable publication. Cautious and conservative 
in its weather forecasts, especially for the last few 
months of the year, it al-to prints a number of safe 
and useful maxims and sage reflections side by side 
with the monthly calendar. " Uncle Zekiel says 
that notwithstanding all the modern time-saving 
contrivances, there don't seem to be so much time 
left as there used to be." " A good many farmers, 
and a good many other men, too, for that matter, 
would know a lot if they had not forgotten so many 
things." An excellent opening suggestion on the 
January page is this : " Keep a notebook and a 
scraphook, or a combination of both." Those who 
like the homely, the practical, and the aphoristic, 
should order their days by "The Old Farmer's 
Almanac." 



SUPERIORITY OF AN " UNCUT " COPY of a 
book to a copy that hat* been shaved and {tared to

illustrated (in a negative way) than by a curious 
instance that has just come to our notice. At a 
recent Merwin-Clayton sale of books, in New York, 
a copy of the 1820 edition of Henry Brooke's " Fool 
of Quality," " judiciously revised and edited by the 
Rev. .John Wesley," was among the items sold. But 
it was not a tall, uncut copy, as proved both by its 
appearance and by an indignant note written in it 
by a former owner. "The marginal notes in this 
book," writes the aggrieved anonymous possessor of 
the volume, "were inserted by Samuel Taylor 
Coleridge, to whom I lent it when I was residing at 
Highgate. The binder threw them away two fly- 
leaves filled with his (Coleridge's) comments, and 
shaved off the edges of the volume so close that it 
is often impossible to ascertain the purport of the 
original note. It may be a warning to others of 
the craft that the misguided delinquent died of 
cholera shortly after being paid his bill for spoiling 
this hook. I find his was the solitary instance of 
death by that disease in Highgate." This will ntrike 
a responsive chord in the breast of those who have 
had cause for similar complaint. 



THE CLASSIFICATION OF LIBRARY WORKERS 

develops as a natural and indeed almost inevitable 
process in a profession that concerns itself so 
unceasingly and (with the constant enlargement 
of the domain of literature) so increasingly with 
classification in all its major and minor divisions, 
and with the attaching of appropriate and suffi- 
ciently conspicuous labels to the objects classified. 
The ST. Louis Public Library has just elaborated and 
applied a scheme of classification by which the 
entire staff is first divided into three classes, 
"those in regular grades, those in special grades, 
and those in ungraded occupations." The head 
librarian seems to form a class by himself, and 
under him are ranged the three above-named classes, 
subdivided into sections A, B, C, D. K, for the regu- 
lar grades, and into sections (1), (2), (3), for the 
special, while the ungraded persons, having neither 
letters nor numbers ( but not therefore necessarily 
illiterate or innumerable) bring up the rear with 
broom and coal-scuttle and such-like insignia of 
office. The qualifications requisite for each of these 
classes and sub-classes, and the formalities to be 
complied with in order to pass from a lower to a 
higher grade, are briefly explained in a type-written 
bulletin issued by the Library. 



A NEWSPAPER OF NEWSPAPERS, like a " Review 
of Reviews " or a " Literary Digest," would seem 
to have its place in the scheme of things journalistic. 
The busy man's daily newspaper, after the model 
of the busy man's monthly or weekly review, is a 
desideratum long felt by many impatient patrons of 
the increasingly voluminous sheets that chronicle 
the diurnal happenings of the world along with a

quantity of things that have not happened. Begin- 
ning about the first of this month, Mr. Ernest F. 
Birmingham, editor and publisher of "The Fourth 
Estate," proposes to issue a reasonably small after- 
noon journal, sifting and condensing the news of 
the world, skimming the cream of current editorial 
opinion, and " expanding the news of art, literature, 
music, the drama in its higher phases, education, 
religion, civic and economic questions, and the like, 
to an extent greater than is possible in any existing 
daily publication." Excellent paper and presswork 
and superior illustrations are promised. If all this 
wealth of laudable intention is realized, and also 
the exalted purpose is attained " so to conduct the 
paper that everything that appears in its columns 
will be considered as authoritative and practically 
the last word on the subject," then " The News- 
Letter," as the hopeful venture is to be named, will 
indeed supply a real want and make for the raising 
of the standard of journalism. 



AN INSTANCE OF LITERARY MASQUERADING that 

is reported to have deceived even the experienced 
cataloguers at the British Museum is rather note- 
worthy. Many readers were doubtless somewhat 
puzzled a few years ago by the oriental manner and 
appearance of Mr. F. W. Bain's book of haunting 
fairy-tales entitled " A Digit of the Moon." The 
author's mystifying hint of a Sanskrit origin to these 
stories and his perfect command of the oriental style 
of narrative he being a scholar thoroughly versed 
in East Indian lore and legend combined to deceive 
even the wary ; and so his book was classed with 
oriental literature by the Museum authorities, who 
also shelved in the same department its successors, 
" A Heifer of the Dawn," "A Draught of the Blue," 
" In the Great God's Hair," " An Essence of the 
Dusk," and others. The offering of translated work 
as original is a common enough practice, but the 
disclaiming of originality for one's own inspired 
ideas is not so common though a few conspicuous 
instances readily come to mind. At any rate, Mr. 
Bain's modesty seems now to have been unveiled, 
and the British Museum has made haste to re- 
classify the product of his gifted pen.

PUNGENT UTTERANCES FROM BALZAC have been 
quoted in abundance from his commonplace books, 
but the choicest collection of these sayings (or 
writings, rather) is found in the unpublished but 
soon-to-be-published notebook which the novelist 
used to call "the great park of my ideas." M. 
Jacques Cre'pet is the editor and annotator of the 
volume, which will bear the title, " Fences, Sujets, 
Fragmens," and from which a few choice passages 
have recently found their way into print. For ex- 
ample : " There are authors who are not viviparous " 
which no one will dispute. "Space, darkness, 
terror three great sources of poetry." "To doubt 
everything and to doubt nothing in both cases 
one betrays the same defect." " The finest revenge 
is the scorn of revenge." "Genius has big ears 



on the inside." "Virtue's sentinel is work " the 
complement to Isaac Watts's well-known lines about 
Satan and mischief and idle hands. "Everyone 
who thinks strongly raises a scandal." " Excessive 
civilization is close to barbarism, as steel is close to 
rusting. A moment's forgetfulness, and the thing 
happens." On the whole, there seems to have been 
rather more of bitterness than of sweetness, of 
doubt than of faith, of pensive melancholy than of 
radiant joy. in Balzac's musings. 



HOMER'S UNDYING CHARM for the appreciative is 
attested by the appearance, every few years, of a 
new translation of his " Iliad " or " Odyssey,'' or of 
both. The number of extant renderings in all 
modern tongues must be innumerable. Merely in 
the catalogue of the libraries of the late William 
Everett, and of his father, Edward Everett, which are 
to be sold this month, one meets with nearly a score 
of different versions of Homer. And Mr. Prentice 
Cummings of Brookline, busy lawyer and street 
railway president though he is, has found or made 
time to add another to the endless list, his being an 
achievement in hexameters that seems deserving of 
a cordial reception. As long as history shall be 
re-written for each new generation and the passion 
of the human heart re-sung, so long will the charm 
of Helen, the valor of Achilles, and the wanderings 
of Ulysses, be over and over again re-told from the 
epics of Homer. ... 

JOHN MORLEY THE WRITER AND JOHN MORLEY 
THE STATESMAN are almost two different persons. 
His recent reported resignation of public office has 
elicited press comment on his administration of 
Indian affairs, and it is even claimed that his chief 
title to fame rests on what he has accomplished in 
British India. But we who have always associated 
his name with those admirable woiks on Diderot 
and Voltaire and Rousseau, on Burke and Walpole 
and Cobden, with the early and highly successful 
editorship of " The Fortnightly Review," as also 
with the editorship of the first two-score numbers 
of the "English Men of Letters" f-eries, and later 
with the monumental life of Gladstone, we know 
better. Not as Lord Morley, Secretary of State for 
India, but as John Morley, scholar and author in 
the fields of history and literature, will he be longest 
and most favorably remembered. 
... 

THE SEASON'S ABUNDANCE OF BIOGRAPHIES OF 
PUBLIC MEN, especially of men in political life, is 
something unprecedented. We have, for example, 
the first volume of Mr. Monypenny's four-volume 
work on Disraeli, based largely on those f-eventy 
volumes of the statesman's papers that Lord Rowton 
preserved so long and so faithfully. Then there 
are lives of John Bright and Cecil Rhodes and John 
Redmond, and autobiographical reminiscences by 
Mr. William O'Brien, while in this country the

MACAULAT, MR. HUTSON, AND THE WRITING 

OK Hl.sTnkY. 

(To the Editor of THR DIAL.) 

I have been interested in the letter of Mr. Hut son 
on The Writing of History," aud in the replies called 
out by it Mr. Hutson tells us that history never has 
been a science, and that it is in a fair way of ceasing to 
be literature, and he advises us to get back to the spirit 
and methods of Macau lay as soon as we conveniently 
can. Those who reply to Mr. Hutson say that while 
history may not be a science, it is scientific in its methods. 
They deny that any historian tries to write badly, and 
they contend that many historians since Macaulay's time, 
such as Kenan and Luchaire, have written well, and 
that if we do not all write like Macaulay it is not 
because we do not wish to do so. They maintain that 
Macaulay was a genius, that England has produced but 
one Macaulay, aud that it is too much to expect us so- 
called historians to be geniuses like Macaulay, and to 
have a style like his; they think that, even if we 
attempted to imitate him, our books, doctor's theses and 
the like, would probably not displace the latest novel 
on the young ladies' dressing-tables. 

Probably they would not. But what interested me 
most was that your correspondents, differing at so many 
points, were quite agreed that there never was a style 
like Macaulay's. I have been waiting to hear someone 
say that he could not endure Macaulay's style. I remem- 
ber well the first time I read of Macaulay's History hav- 
ing been found, by the young ladies, when it first came 
out, more interesting than the latest novel. I was in 
college then, and I ran to the library to get Macaulay's 
History, hoping against hope that no one had drawn it 
out before me. No one had. I was elated at the thought 
that the history of England might be taken on so easily, 
and with the same pleasure I had experienced in learning 
about Athos and Porthos. I went home prepared to 
make the acquaintance of an English Dumas. Well, I 
was disappointed. I did not keep the book on my 
dressing-table, but returned it to the library. Since 
then, I have tried again and again to read Macaulay's 
History; and, by dint of much perseverance, I have 
succeeded in reading most of it. Imagine the whole 
history of England written by Macaulay ! I cannot 
imagine it; but I have often tried to imagine what the Pil- 
grim's Chorus, adapted to fife and drum, would be like. 
One of your correspondents, " J. W. T.," in his reply 
to Mr. Hutson, brought forward Renan, and set him up, 
with some timidity, I thought, by the side of Macaulay, 
to show that there had been some good writing since 
Macaulay's time. He seems to say that Renan writes 
very well indeed, and cites one passage which even 
Macaulay might have envied; and he mentions others, 
such at Lavisse and Luchair, who write well, though of 
course not as well as Macaulay. England, as he says, 
has produced but one Macaulay. Well, I should think 
that one was enough. Of course it would be a distinct 
loss not to have had one Macaulay, to observe the aver- 



age middle-class Englishman raised to the nth power 
is certainly worth while; but one such will do very well. 
Now, if it conies to style, or to matter either, or to man- 
ner, or to philosophy, I much prefer Renan. It is trm- 
that be has not the wealth of allusion to all the litera- 
tures of the world that Maraulay lias. Hut I think I 
must care less for literary allusions and quotations than 
some readers. I despise a Greek quotation because I 
cannot read it, and I am suspicious of a Latin quotation 
because I cannot always read it easily. O tempore I O 
marts ! if this is apropos here. 

Mr. Hutson complains that the new school turm-d it* 
back on Macaulay. " They drowned their thought with 

:in -ndlfs> tan-,'!.- <>( nnnlilirat I," a> !.< ><p aptly s.-ivs. 

" Those who still stood by rhetoric looked on Macaulay's 
style as crude and sometimes as cacophonous, and aimed 
at effects which we call, after the French, precious.' 
Of these were Walter Pater and Robert Louis Steven- 
son. Well, what of the result? Perhaps we have 
greater exactness as to facts, in many cases new points 
of view, a more cautious summing up of the evidence; 
but nowhere is the clear and (lowing current of narra- 
tive, the allurement of style, the wonderful touch of 
art in the presentation of truth." 

Incidentally, I am not convinced that Robert Louis 
Stevenson is "precious," at least not in the sense Mr. 
Hutson means. I do not wish to enlarge on that ; but 
since Mr. Hutson has mentioned Walter Pater, I would 
like to quote, apropos of " allurement of style, the 
wonderful touch of art in the presentation of truth," 
the following passage from that writer. It is taken 
from the essay on Leonardo da Vinci, and is an inter- 
pretation of the famous picture La Gioconda " : 

" The presence that thus rose so strangely beside the 
waters, is expressive of what in the ways of a thousand yean 
men had come to desire. Hera is the head upon which all 
" the ends of the world are come," and the eyelids are a little 
weary. It is a beauty wrought out from within upon the 
flesh, the deposit, little cell by cell, of strange thoughts and 
fantastic reveries and exquisite passions. Set it for a moment 
beside one of those white Greek goddesses or beantifnl 
women of antiquity, and how would they be troubled by this 
beauty, into which the soul with all it* maladies has passed ! 
All the thoughts and experience of the world have etched 
and moulded there, in that which they have of power to re- 
fine and make expressive the outward form, the animalism 
of Greece, the lust of Rome, the revery of the middle age with 
its spiritual ambition and imaginative loves, the return of 
the Pagan world, the sins of the Borgias. She is older than the 
rocks among which she sits ; like tin- vampire, she has been 
dead many times, and learned the secret* of the grave ; and 
has been a diver in deep seas, and keeps their fallen day 
about her ; and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern 
merchants : and, as Leda, was the mother of Helen of Troy, 
and, as Saint Anne, the mother of Mary ; and all this has 
been to her but aa the sound of lyres and flutes, and lives 
only in the delicacy with which it has moulded the changing 
lineaments, and tinged the eyelids and the hands. The fancy 
of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experi- 
ences, is an old one ; and modern thought has conceived the 
idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and Humming up in 
itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady Lisa 
illicit stand aathe embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol 
of the modern idea." 

Meanwhile, I sympathize with Mr. Hutson in the 
matter of doctor's theses. I have written one aud read 
several. Professor Sioussat, in his defence of doctor's 
theses, gives good reasons for their existence, some of 
which are, at the same time, the best reasons in the 
world for not printing them. CARL BKCKKR.

A POET OF THE WORLD.* 

Somewhere in the correspondence of Edmund 
Clarence Stedman occurs the following pas- 
sage: "Five hundred years of Earth are none 
too many could we retain vigor and health. 
Wouldn't you like to be fifty years a traveller, 
fifty an inventor, fifty a statesman to practice 
painting, sculpture, oratory and all the time 
a fisher, sailor, poet, author, and man of the 
world ? I should, and then might be willing 
to try another sphere." This confession of 
eager vitality, of an interest in life to which 
nothing human could possibly be alien, illus- 
trates the most characteristic trait of the man 
whose death, not quite two years ago, bereft us 
of our foremost poet and our most beloved man 
of letters. The seventy-five years of his life 
were far from sufficient to satisfy his measure- 
less desire for life, but they were nevertheless 
singularly rich in many varieties of experience 
that which chastens as well as that which exalts 
and their outcome was a ripeness of temper 
and wisdom such as is vouchsafed to few among 
mortal men. The record of his life is now 
spread before us, chiefly in his own words, in the 
elaborate " autobiographic biography " which 
has been prepared by Miss Laura Stedman, the 
poet's grand-daughter and sole surviving des- 
cendant, with the collaboration of his old and 
close friend, Dr. George M. Gould, whom he 
expressly wished to have a share in the work. 

In calling Mr. Stedman "a poet of the 
world," we have had chiefly in mind his many 
points of contact with life and the wide range 
of his interests. The designation is not to be 
taken in the sense of "world-poet," for his best 
friends would claim no more for him than that 
he was distinctively a product of American cul- 
ture, occupying a seat in the American Par- 
nassus a little less exalted than the stations of 
the half-dozen poets who were from one to four 
decades his seniors. Still less is it to be taken 
as meaning that he was a worldly-minded poet, 
with eyes imperfectly opened to the spiritual 
aspects of life, for this would indeed be to mis- 
interpret his aspirations and ideals. But in 
the sense already suggested by our introductory 
quotation he was very noticeably " a poet of 
the world," a man who lived among his fellows 
and delighted in them as inheritors of a com-

mon humanity, a man who could be many things 
to many men while still guarding the citadel of 
his own soul. The contrast between him and 
such poets as Poe and Emerson and Whittier 
was in this respect very marked ; it was similar 
to the contrast between Byron and Keats, be- 
tween Browning and Tennyson. In Stedman's 
case, the contrast was emphasized by the fact 
that throughout most of his career he was 
struggling for a living in the common mart. 
He once wrote to his mother : " I am not swal- 
lowed up of poetry. I earn eight dollars per 
day, but my business friends don't know that 
I ever heard the word." The honorable way 
in which he thus recognized that the primary 
obligation of a man even of a poet is to 
earn a living and support a family occasionally 
brought upon him the undeserved reproach of 
sacrificing to Mammon, and earned for him the 
meaningless newspaper- title of " banker-poet," 
or " broker-poet." This he keenly resented, 
and in one case, moved from a dignified silence 
by a peculiarly reckless attack, wrote a pointed 
letter to the editor of the offending publication. 
The article, he said, 

" Conveys the impression that I am devoted to mak- 
ing money; that I surrender the time which should be 
given to art to accumulating wealth as a stock-operator, 
and only give my leisure hours to poetry; that I am, 
in short, a mere money-chaser, and thus by choice an 
amateur or dilettante. This hypothesis may have formed 
itself in your mind from the vulgar newspaper-phrase 
' broker-poet ' which paragraphers have attached to my 
name, and which is as unwelcome to me as the term 
clergyman-editor doubtlessly would be to you and as 
utterly senseless." 

" Your hypothesis has just this basis of truth. I wish 
to live, and have dear ones for whose comfort and hap- 
piness I have taken sacred vows. Were I content to 
see them enduring the ills (to which you commend me) 
of absolute ' poverty,' I could not keep them even from 
cold and hunger by poetry alone. I am a member of 
the Stock Exchange, one of the mass of hard-working 
brokers who there toil humbly and honestly for their 
daily bread. This is for me a cause neither of pride 
nor of complaint. Most authors who have not inherited 
property, and whose writings are of an aesthetic or phil- 
osophical kind, have to sustain themselves by some labor 
other than that nearest their hearts." 

" I married young and, owing to a chain of circum- 
stances, found myself, upon a time, penniless ; and with 
a family to support, and had the choice of several 
modes of life, all of which you have seen exemplified in 
the careers of authors great and small : 1. I could 
leave my family to shift for themselves, fling my harp 
over my shoulders, and go on my tuneful way in quest 
of pleasure and fame. 2. I could support my house- 
hold, and continue to write verses, by a process of credit 
and imposition; could borrow of friends, refuse to pay 
the baker and washerwoman, filk the butcher, and 
maintain the traditional right of bardlets to exemption 
from the claims of decency and honor; or, 3. I might 
work at some occupation which would enable me to

earn an honest living, and write poetry when I found 
time, strength, and the heart to do so." 

l/et me at once acknowledge that the stem neces- 
sity of earning so much a week before I can write a 
line, interferes with and retards my literary work. . . . 
When baring a little money ahead, I have several 
times left the ' Street ' altogether, and have been devoted 
to study and authorship, until my reserve was exhausted 
and I had to go back again. Thus it happens that I 
have not yet been able to own my own home, to keep a 
horse, or even to visit Europe, where I have so many 
friends and literary comrades, and whither I have longed 
for years to go. But I have had a modest subsistence, 
having educated my children one of whom I have 
ventured, even, to send to college ; and have been able 
to write and print a few books whose merits are short, 
very far short, of my wishes and ideal." 

This apologia pro vita sua is one of the 
most strongly-felt and self-revealing documents 
in the whole biography ; the fact that it defends 
the writer from a charge which no one would 
now dream of making does not lessen its signifi- 
cance as an expression of the poet's character. 
The story of Stedinan's boyhood is interest- 
ing, and in a way pathetic. He was an infant 
when his father died, and he was separated from 
his mother for a considerable part of his early 
life, at school and in the care of relatives. Soon 
after he entered Yale, at the age of fifteen, his 
mother re-married and went to Italy with her 
husband, who represented the United States 
government at the Court of Piedmont. Mother 
and son were thus parted for a long term of 
years, and the seriousness of this separation is 
revealed in his tenderly affectionate letters to 
the distant parent. He was a precocious youth, 
a great reader with an early passion for poetry, 
but not without a healthy interest in boyish 
sports. His means were narrow, and he was 
not altogether successful in supporting himself 
while in college upon an annual income of three 
hundred dollars. He was inclined to be a little 
priggish at first, and formulated a set of rules 
for his conduct that would have made him a 
very model of student virtue had he not soon 
learned to depart from them. The reaction 
came in his sophomore year, and his escapades 
resulted in an intimation from the authorities 
that he had better seek another field for his 
talents. In his old age he thus wrote about the 
affair: 

" I was an imaginative and excitable boy, and became 
rather reckless; fell off in all my studies; cut prayers, 
etc., and excelled only in English composition, and in 
reading. . . . My nights were spent with beer, whiskey- 
skin, skittles, and howling around town. How I lived 
through it, I don t know. At the end of sophomore 
year, 1 wab arrested one night with some older men and 
taken before the local Dogberry. The others gave false 
names, paid their fines, and got away, but I was recogni- 



zed by my long hair, and other eccrutricitifs, and re- 
ported to the faculty ; was m.ti. ;iU-d tu Northampton, 
where I panned a summer under the charge of 1'rofi-ssor 
Dudley, a famous Greek scholar, who had a private 
seminary there. The institution was full of a still 
wilder crowd than I- had met at Yale, and I joined with 
them in painting the town red, getting in love with the 
Northampton girls, and into trouble generally." 
After this summer, he went to visit a college 
chum on a Virginia plantation, and of this visit 
the following anecdote is told : 

A custom more honored in the breach than in the 
observance - prevailed in the hospitable mansion, where 
he was a guest; the custom of opening the shutters, 
and welcoming the various guests by sending to their 
rooms a quart pitcher of mint julep, intended as a 
loving-cup for the household. This time it was left 
first at the door of young Stedman by an old white- 
haired darkey, who returned later to take the pitcher 
on its further rounds. When the black-and-white mes- 
senger came for this purpose, the old man looked at 
the pitcher, then at the dark-eyed youth ; then his eyes 
began to twinkle, and, as he went downstairs with the 
empty pitcher, his head shoo and his shoulders rattled." 

Stedman was predestined for the service of 
the muse. " As soon as he could speak," his 
mother says, " he lisped in rhyme, and as soon 
as he could write, he gave shape and measure 
to his dreams." He himself says : " From my 
earliest remembrance I made poetry. All of 
the Cleveland blood do bad cess to them! I 
was a natural writer, an insatiate reader 
especially of fiction, adventure, poetry." His 
first poet was Scott " what better fodder for a 
boy?" then he discovered Keats, Shelley, and 
Coleridge, had the necessary attack of Byron- 
ism, and gradually attained to the conception of 
poetry as art, a conception fully ripened when 
he learned to know and love Tennyson in his 
early twenties. His aesthetic creed must li;i\v 
become fairly fixed when he could write, as in 
1857 : " Now, to end with Tennyson, I want 
to say that through all his writings of every 
style, there runs, overtly or covertly, the tnu-st, 
noblest, broadest philosophy of the age. He 
has made me wiser and better, and if his grand 
thoughts are expressed in the most finished and 
perfect manner, it is a fault that the thousand 
shiftless writers of prosaic verse would do well 
to imitate. * By way of poetic p'rfnrmaiitv, 
Stedman had already won college distinct ions, 
and shown himself to be at least a facile \n>i 
fier endowed with much poetic sensibility. Mis 
41 Hours of Idleness " or " Victor and Cazire '' 
period produced nothing that is particularly 
worth preserving, but it drtmiiined his bent, 
and supplies its element to the interest of his 
life-story.

printer, publisher, and editor, and the story of 
the boy-and-girl marriage which seemed so fool- 
ish but which laid the foundation of a half- 
century of happy domestic life, we find Stedman 
in New York at the age of twenty-one, in search 
of a living. He experimented in selling clocks, 
in real estate brokerage, in the law, and in the 
railroad business all the time with one eye 
upon journalism as a practical gateway to liter- 
ature. One of the most interesting chapters in 
the biography is his account of the Unitary 
Home in which the family lived from 1858 to 
1860. This was an experiment in modified 
Fourierism, a kind of cooperative boarding- 
house, which solved the problem of comfortable 
existence upon a moderate outlay. He calls it 
" A Brownstone Utopia," describing both its 
management and its denizens in a very charm- 
ing way. This description was prepared as a 
chapter of the " Eeminiscences " upon which 
he was engaged near the end of his life, a work 
of which he brought only a few fragments to a 
finished state. 

The story of his successful skit, " The 
Diamond Wedding," and of how he almost had 
to fight a duel on account of it, is too long to 
relate here, but it must be mentioned as one of 
the things that brought him into closer rela- 
tions with journalism. It was soon followed by 
" How Old Brown Took Harper's Ferry " and 
" The Ballad of Lager Bier," the three ballads 
together earning for him a reputation that his 
more serious and artistic poetry had failed to 
secure. He received no pay from the " Tribune " 
for these poems, but they brought him his first 
assignment from that paper to report the fun- 
eral of Irving at Sunnyside, and he received ten 
dollars for the four columns of his report. At 
this time also, he entered into his lifelong friend- 
ships with Taylor, Stoddard, Leland, Boker, 
Aldrich, Willis, Winter, and many others. Of 
that joyous company, Mr. Winter is now the 
sole survivor. 

Immediately after the fall of Fort Sumter, 
Stedman set out for Washington as correspond- 
ent of the New York "World," and for the 
remainder of the year 1862 he was hard at work 
either at the capital or in the field. He saw the 
first battle of Bull Run, and described it in what 
was called " the best single letter written during 
the whole war." But he did more than observe, 
as will be seen from these words of another 
correspondent : 

" The enemy appeared in sight, firing their guns, the 
balls raining upon us thick. Emerging from the valley 
we saw the reporter of the ' World,' with the standard 



of the Massachusetts Fifth, waving it over him and 
pleading for the men to rally around him, but it was in 
vain; they heeded him not. An officer asked the priv- 
ilege of riding behind him. It was granted, and before 
they had gone a hundred yards a shot from the thicket 
struck the officer in the head and he reeled off. Mr. 
Stedman wrapped up the standard and galloped about 
a mile ahead, and afterwards succeeded in rallying a 
larger force." 

Thus did the poet receive his baptism of fire, 
and become qualified for something better than 
an arm-chair singer of the battle-field. His 
stirring war-poems followed in rapid succession, 
and were among the most inspiring that our four 
years' struggle produced. At the beginning of 
1862, Stedman became an assistant to Attorney- 
General Bates, occupying the post until late in 
the following year. Then he returned to New 
York, got more and more definitely into the 
banking business, and made fairly steady prog- 
ress. He wrote to his mother in 1865 : 

" I enclose a slip, to show you the honorable and 
large position of my house. Although obliged to leave, 
poor, 1 have the satisfaction of having, unaided, built 
up the most popular and successful young banking- 
house in New York, and having shown that poetry, if 
good, may not unfit a man for other work, if he chooses 
to do it. If I had health for five years, I would write 
two or three books, and open banking-houses in London 
and Paris, in connection with the New York house." 

Among the happenings of the ten years fol- 
lowing, we may mention Stedman's joining of 
the Stock Exchange Board in 1869, his restora- 
tion to membership in the Yale class of '53, 
with the degrees of A.B. and M.A., in 1871, 
and his publication of "Victorian Poets" in 
1875. To this period belong the extremely 
interesting letters from Swinburne upon which 
we commented last year (July 1, 1909). Mr. 
Watts-Dunton calls them " by far the most 
interesting letters that Algernon ever wrote." 
The decade brought varying fortunes, and alter- 
nating moods of gayety and depression. Here 
is a confession dated 1870 : 

" Have passed the fatal to poets thirty-seventh 
year, and begin to think I am no poet; only a poor, 
gray-haired, unsuccessful dreamer, trying to get fat by 
feeding on the wind. Am as poor as on my twentieth 
birthday, except in the love of friends. Mother and 
Mary send me gifts; my wife and boys love me, and 
we are all in a hired home by ourselves, but O, how 
poor, and how precarious the future ! And how my 
genius, whatever it may be, is cramped, warped, and 
gradually atrophying away." 

When the " Victorian Poets " had at last gone 
through the press early in 1875, the author 
took the first real outing of his life, setting sail 
for " The Carib Sea" for a few weeks of dreamy 
ease. This was such a joy as he had never 
before known, and the enchantment of the ex-

perience colored his thoughts for all the rest of 
his days. A second trip was made in 1892, 
and from the two journeys flowed a spring of 
lyrical inspiration which offers unfailing refresh- 
ment to the readers of his collected poems. 

For the next quarter-century, S ted man re- 
mained an active member of the Stock Ex- 
change; finally disposing of his seat in 1900. 
Oa that date he wrote in his diary : 

"Sold my 'seat' in the New York Stock Exchange 
for 839,500, less a commission, etc. This ends a mem- 
bership of thirty and one-half years (since the summer 
of 1809), and it is like tearing a tree up by the roots. 
All this time I have walked that floor, until its tragedies 
and comedies its drama its friendships in battle and 
in action in success and despair have become a 
part of my life. It is the tirst chance, in seventeen 
years, for retiring with honor, though half the money 
goes to liquidate my debts to my dear comrade Baker, 
who has carried me through evil times. And I am at 
best leaving the raft which has given me support since 
my ship was scuttled in 1883. Here at sixty-six, I don't 
know whether I have strength to live by writing, and I 
have no other means of support." 

The reference to the " scuttled ship " has to do 
with the tragedy of his business life. In the 
Spring of 1882, fortune was smiling upon him 
as never before, and he went to Europe, plan- 
ning an Italian vacation of several months. But 
he was barely settled in Venice, when a cable- 
gram informed him that his business had sud- 
denly become a wreck. Returning at once to 
New York, he set about saving what was possi- 
ble, and after a very black year of struggle, 
culminating in one terrible day of the following 
Summer, was able to write : " As it is, my bank- 
ing capital is gone I am in a sea of doubt and 
trouble but have averted dishonor, saved my 
confidential and my Wall Street engagements, 
saved many humble friends from ruin." His 
tangled affairs were settled by the end of the 
year, and ho resumed, regretfully, his active 
membership of the Stock Exchange. How he 
felt about it all may be learned from this extract 
from a letter : 

Tin- scholar's delightful indolence crept over me 
once more, during the few months when I stayed up 
town, and smoked, and wrote at my will. Goda ! how 
I hated to go back to meaner things. Nothing but the 
great value of my 'seat' to my family, in case of my 
death, and the will to have absolute vindication, led me 
to accept it again. For I found that we could live on 
the rent of Laura's house added to my literary income 
provided I should write altogether. Yea, and a quiet, 
happy life writing poetry. Think of what duty has 
compelled me to give up." 

The story of Stedman's life is mainly recorded 
in the first of the two large volumes now before 
us. It was in 1897 that he established himself 
in a suburban home almost a country home, 



although within easy reach of New York at 
Lawrence Park, Bronx \ ilk'. This was the Casa 
Laura in which he spent a term of relatively 
peaceful years, saddened toward the close by the 
death of Mrs. St-<lmaii in 1905, and of th-ir 
oldest son a few months later. Then, in 1906, 
the house was sold, and he returned to the city, 
occupying the apartment in Broadway where 
he was to die less than two years later. Miss 
Stedman gives us the following affecting arrount 
of his last hours : 

At the family dinner the old-time hour at which 
to talk over intimate and outside affairs, the evening 
before his death, he was, lays Mrs. Ellen Douglas Sted- 
man, ' more like himself than for days. He long had 
been,' she adds, ' putting on a brave face to the outside 
world,' but he was now 'unusually bright and alert.' 
Did he, perhaps, forefeet the coming end, and was he 
smiling, even laughing, at Death, as he crowded the 
days and hours with social activities and duties ? He 
followed his guests to the door, and keeping them a lit tit- 
longer, told ' one more story ' before Good-night was 
called, as if pleading to be thus remembered. He 
was accustomed to leave the papers, books, etc., on his 
work-table so that he could easily resume his study or 
writing where he had left off: this last night his books 
were balanced to the hour, and everything was ar- 
ranged and ordered as if he were, indeed, going away 
upon a journey. On the morning of Saturday, January 
18, 1908, Mr. Stedman rose a little later than usual, 
and passed the mom ing at work upon his last essay. 
His mail was large, and he said: ' Twenty-seven letters! 
What is the use ! ' After a late luncheon, he passed to 
another room and fell." 

Three days later, the funeral services were held, 
and a year later his friends gathered in the 
Carnegie Lyceum to pay their tribute to his 
memory. 

The second of the two volumes of this biog- 
raphy supplements rather than continues the 
first, by devoting separate chapters to Sted man's 
chief literary works, as illustrated by the corre- 
spondence and criticism that they evoked. Other 
chapters are concerned with his public activities 
and private friendships, and to the whole an 
extensive bibliography is appended. The chief 
achievement of this second volume is the setting 
forth of the many ways in which he was in touch 
with life, each contact being a vital experi<Micr 
for himself as well as a matter of interest for 
others. So rich is the material here offered that 
no review can pretend to do it justice, and \%v 
can only record the plain fact that the work is 
interesting beyond almost any other of its kind 
in the field of American literature. Two scraps 
from the feast spread before us may be offered 
in further illustration of the quality of this auto- 
biographic revelation.

you, 'tis only an aggravation, now for me to see youth and 
beauty f I see that my beard is white and they see 
it and yet I don't feel it. I havn't a ' realizing sense ' 
of it, and why should I voluntarily incite the woes of 
Tantalus? The most appalling and absurd scrape I 
ever got into was when Rose Cleveland beguiled me 
to tea at Mrs. Reed s finishing-school. Then she took 
me into the big hall with its waxed floor. There were 
fifty full-grown girls, doubtless all thinking me an old 
prig. However, I sat down between the prettiest two 
one in pink, one in blue and we soon were flirting 
at a great rate. Mark you ! that horrid Mrs. Reed 
switched me up on the platform, and then presented 
all those fifty girls to me till I felt like an octogen- 
arian muff and a figure-head. They hated me, I knew, 
and I wanted to hug them and talk nonsense to them. I 
am not a bit of a show, and Mrs. Stedman justly says 
that I have no dignity. Girls are good to kiss not to 
teach. I would rather have been Anacreon than Solon." 

With this Ruskinian outburst we will join 
the following note for the unwritten " Reminis- 
cences ": 

" At least I have obeyed at eve the voice obeyed at 
prime; the more so, as in this matter desire went hand 
in hand with duty. Strength wanes, passion long since 
flew, but the compulsive gift of youth stays by to the 
last. If I have been false to it through long stages of 
life, it was because there is a still higher law that of 
protection for others, and honor among one's kind. I 
confess that I am not of the Scriptural (patriarchal) 
breed, that would slay or sacrifice those under my law 
or protection, even at the command of an Angel in the 
bush, the thicket, or the cloud." 

How intimate, in both charm and appeal, are 
these contrasted confessions ! They illustrate 
the lighter fancy and the more serious mood of 
reflection that sojourned side by side in Sted- 
man's complex personality. He was truly one 
who *' warmed both hands before the fire of 
life," and so survives in the memory of those 
who loved him that they are fain still to think 
of him, not as dying in any real sense, but as 
flinging " off somewhere into the ether," as he 
said of Landor, " still facing the daybreak and 
worshipped by many rising stars."

stone of stumbling and a rock of offence unto 
the falling and redemption of many in both 
houses of Israel." But no picture drawn by a 
hostile critic could be more frank in its revela- 
tion of groping experiments and failures than 
Miss Addams's own account in her record of the 
first twenty years of that remarkable institution 
which has done so much to soften the sharpness 
of class hostility and bring the inhabitants of a 
great city a little nearer to the realization of 
the fact that they are indeed all one family, one 
member of which cannot suffer without injury 
to the whole body. 

Hull-House is not merely a "settlement"; it 
is a garden of civic health and sweetness ; it is 
a piece of sound flesh grafted into the midst 
of a plague-spot in the body of the sprawling 
giant Chicago; it is a life and a heart of love 
anastomosing into the arteries of a community 
impoverished by wealth and the struggle for 
wealth. Therefore Miss Addams has done 
well to begin her account of Hull- House with a 
sketch of the influences surrounding her youth, 
which prompted her to devote her life to this 
work. In connection with her first visit to the 
poorer quarter of her home town, she tells us : 

" I remember launching at my father the pertinent 
inquiry, why people lived in such horrid little houses 
so close together, and that, after receiving his explan- 
ation, I declared with much firmness, when I grew up 
I should of course have a large house, but it would not 
be built among the other large houses, but right in the 
midst of horrid little houses like these." 

Next to this instinctive desire for equal 
privileges was the sense of absolute sincerity 
cherished in the young Jane by the life and 
precept of her father, leaving upon her mind 
the final impression, that "it did not matter 
much whether one understood foreordination or 
not, but that it was very important not to pre- 
tend to understand what you didn't understand, 
and that you must always be honest with your- 
self inside, whatever happened." 

In these two influences of childhood it is 
possible to discern the dominating factors of the 
power of Hull- House : the will to help, and the 
open mind. And in the latter of these two 
factors lies the differential of Hull-House. No 
other settlement undertaking has been carried 
on with quite the same absence of pre-conception 
and prejudice, with the same willingness to learn 
and be adapted to the conditions, with the same 
absence of the air of patronage. Most settle- 
ments, for instance, have been outposts of denom- 
inational conquest : behind the kindly act was 
the more or less open suggestion, " Do not for- 
get the church that has done this for you/' Not

only the recipients of neighborly kindness, but 
even the fellow-workers in other settlements, 
were unable to understand a good will that repre- 
sented no propaganda, and were long disposed 
to suspect some dark heresy or atheism behind 
the movement that refused to walk under the 
standard of a denominational creed. 

"During the first decade of Hull-House it was felt 
by propagandists of various social theories that the new 
settlement would be a flue coign of vantage from which 
to propagate social faiths, and that a mere preliminary 
step would be the conversion of the founders; hence I 
have been reasoned with hours at a time, and I recall 
at least three occasions when this was followed by actual 
prayer." 

At one time, indeed, in the early history of 
Hull- House there was an attempt to unify the 
religious life of the " residents " so the regular 
workers call themselves, but it resulted only 
in the conclusion, that it might be possible 
that among such diversified people it was better 
that the Settlement corps should also represent 
varying religious beliefs." 

Miss Addams's book is a faithful reflection 
of the spirit and activities of the Hull- House 
Settlement : modest, unassuming, self-effacing. 
It has much to say of problems and experiments, 
but speaks shyly of lessons and achievements. 
With such a simple platform as good-will and 
open-mindedness, one hunts almost vainly for 
more definite threads of leading. 

A prime difficulty, too often ignored by 
charity workers and journalistic investigators 
of social conditions, was the fact that the resi- 
dents were not actually on the same footing as 
those with whom they proposed to " neighbor." 

"There was always present the harrowing conscious- 
ness of the difference in economic conditions between 
ourselves and our neighbors. Even if we had gone to 
live in the most wretched tenement, there would always 
have been an essential difference between them and 
ourselves, for we should have had a sense of security 
in regard to illness and old age, and the lack of these 
two securities are the specters which most persistently 
haunt the poor.'' 

"We were early impressed with the curious isolation 
of many of the emigrants; an Italian woman once ex- 
pressed her pleasure in the red roses that she saw at one 
of our receptions, in surprise that they 'had been brought 
so fresh all the way from Italy.' She would not believe 
that they had been grown in America. . . . During all 
her six years in Chicago she had lived within ten blocks 
of a florist's window ; she had not been more than a 
five-cent car-ride away from the public parks, but she 
had never dreamed of faring forth for herself, and no 
one had taken her." 

"That a group of Greeks should be permitted to 
slaughter sheep in a basement, that Italian women 
should be allowed to sort over rags collected from the 
city dumps, not only within the city limits, but in a court 
swarming with little children, that immigrant bakers 



should continue unmolested to bake bread for their 
neighbors in unspeakably filthy spaces under the | 
iin-lit, appeared incredible to visitors accustomed to 
careful city regulations." 

lint (if all the aspects of social misery nothing u 
so heartbreaking a unemployment, and it was inevit- 
able that we should sec much of it in a neighborhood 
where low rents attracted the poorly paid worker." 

" We early found ourselves spending many hours in 
efforts to secure work for deserted women, iiiMiraiu 
for bewildered widows, damages for injured operators, 
furniture from the clutches of the installment store. 
The Settlement is valuable as an information and inter- 
pretation bureau. The hospitals, the county agencies, 
and State asylums are often Init vague rumors to tin 
people who need them most. Another function of the 
Settlement to its neighborhood resembles that of th. 
big brother whose mere presence on the playground 
protects the little one from bullies." 

With all these and many more concrete 
problems the Settlement at Hull- House has 
endeavored to implant in its residents and it - 
neighbors a sound and democratic ideal of 
culture ; to civilize their amusements, to hum- 
anize their employments, to ennoble their daily 
routine, " to promote a culture which will not 
set its possessor aside in a class with others like 
himself, but which will, on the contrary, con- 
nect him with all sorts of people by his abilit\ 
to understand them as well as by his power to 
supplement their present surroundings with the 
historic background." 

In the pursuit of these ends Miss Addams 
and her co-workers have undertaken endl 
activities ; they have been garbage inspectors. 
Juvenile Court officers, strike arbitrators, 
members of numerous commissions and of the 
Chicago Board of Education. In the attempt 
to act as " big brother '' to the ignorant and 
wrong-headed, in such cases as the Pullman 
strike, the Averbuch extradition case, the 
Anarchist trials, the teamsters' strike, Hull- 
House naturally incurred the charge of sus- 
taining all the wrongs done in connection with 
these events. 

When Labor ' is in disgrace we are always re- 
garded as belonging to it and share in the opprobrium. 
In the public excitement following the Pullman strike 
Hull-House lost many friends; later the teamsters' 
strike caused another such defection, although my office 
in both cases had been solely that of a duly appointed 
arbitrator." 

Perhaps the most difficult thing for one in 
piililic or semi-public life is to stand out for 
truth and justice against popular clamor, be- 
cause the loss of popularity threatens at least 
immediate usefulness. And the most discour- 
aging feature in this situation is the fact that 
practically no great newspajwr can IH depended 
upon to stand with the misunderstood, but in

almost always found echoing the hue and cry 
of the mob. While the individual representa- 
tives of the great Chicago dailies have often 
been friendly to Hull-House, and have in many 
ways supported Miss Addams's efforts, in great 
emergencies they have been ready, to their 
shame, to decry and misrepresent one whose 
purposes they knew to be absolutely generous 
and noble. 

As has been said, this book is not a book of 
boastings. But with a fine net it is possible 
to gather out at least a partial list of definite 
achievements in which Hull- House has been the 
pioneer, though far from claiming the whole 
credit for them : the appointment of women as 
assistants in outdoor relief work ; the intro- 
duction of civil service methods in State and 
county appointments ; the Public School Art 
Society ; public bathhouses ; branch public libra- 
ries; probation treatment in Juvenile Courts; 
college or university extension ; local textile 
fabric exhibitions ; a purely amateur public 
stage, " through which humble experiments, as 
well as through the more ambitious reforms 
which are attempted in various parts of the 
country, the theatre may at last be restored to 
its rightful place in the community." 

Miss Addams's chapters on The Children of 
Immigrants, The Problem of Poverty, Economic 
Discussion, Labor Legislation in Illinois, So- 
cialized Education, Tolstoism, The Arts at Hull- 
House, Echoes of the Russian Revolution, 
but one might as well name them all, are 
replete with calm and sane observations and 
the report of most interesting experiences. It is 
a great satisfaction to read a book on sociology 
not written by a doctrinaire, containing abso- 
lutely no dogmatism and very few generaliza- 
tions. Yet this does not mean that most 
valuable lessons as well as tense entertainment 
may not be had from the reading of it. Every 
chapter has its share of concrete cases and 
anecdotes, though always such as bear on the 
problems involved. 

The drawbacks to the parole system in the 
Juvenile Court are illustrated by the case of 
the Bohemian boy " out on parole from the old 
detention home of the Juvenile Court itself, 
who brought back five stolen chickens to the 
matron for Sunday dinner, saying that he knew 
the Committee were having 'a hard time to fill 
up so many kids and perhaps these fowl would 
help out.' ' 

A beautiful illustration of the service of the 
Labor Museum maintained in Hull-House is 
given in the following : 



"A certain Italian girl . . . came every Saturday 
evening to a cooking class in the same building in which 
her mother spun in the Labor Museum Exhibit; and yet 
Angelina always left her mother at the front door, while 
she herself went around to a side door because she did 
not wish to be too closely identified in the eyes of the 
rest of the cooking class, with an Italian woman who 
wore a kerchief over her head, uncouth boots, and short 
petticoats. One evening, however, Angelina saw her 
mother surrounded by a group of visitors from the 
School of Education, who much admired the spinning, 
and she concluded from their conversation that her 
mother was the ' best stick-spindle spinner in America.' 
. . . At least two things resulted : she allowed her 
mother to pull out of the big box under the bed the 
beautiful homespun garments, which had previously been 
hidden away as uncouth; and she openly came into the 
Labor Museum by the same door as did her mother, 
proud at least of the mastery of the craft which had 
been so much admired." 

And full of dramatic situations is this experi- 
ence of the charity worker : 

" I recall the dying hour of one old Scotchwoman 
whose long struggle to keep ' respectable ' had so em- 
bittered her that her last words were gibes and taunts 
for those who were trying to minister to her. ' So you 
came in yourself this morning,' did you? You only 
sent things yesterday. I guess you knew when the 
doctor was coming. Don't try to warm my feet with 
anything but that old jacket that I 've got there ; it 
belonged to my boy who was drowned at sea nigh thirty 
years ago, but it 's warmer yet with human feelings than 
any of your damned charity hot water bottles.' Sud- 
denly the harsh gasping voice was stilled in death, and 
I awaited the doctor's coming, shaken and horrified." 

It seems impossible by excerpts to give a 
true impression of the tone of sweet reasonable- 
ness that pervades these pages. It is safe to 
say, however, that few modern books dealing 
directly with social problems give so much light 
and so much uplift to those who feel, as did 
Miss Addams in her youth, the responsibility 
for the wrongs of the social order and are 
prompted to make some effort for their allevia- 
tion. If such would-be workers do not find 
here a plain guide-post to the best course of 
action they will at least receive many valuable 
hints as to the right spirit in which to work, as 
well as concerning many errors to be avoided. 
Says Miss Addams near the close of her book : 

"There is no doubt that residents in a Settlement too 
often move toward their ends ' with hurried and ignoble 
gait,' putting forth thorns in their eagerness to bear 
grapes. It is always easy for those in pursuit of ends 
which they consider of overwhelming importance to 
become themselves thin and impoverished in spirit and 
temper, to gradually develop a dark, mistaken eager- 
ness alternating with fatigue, which supersedes the 
' great and gracious ways ' so much more congruous 
with worthy aims." 

The " practical" man may well question the 
usefulness of much ill-considered so-called Set- 
tlement work, which is often nothing else than

slumming in disguise; but in such influences 
as those of Hull-House it is hard to see anything 
but the noblest sort of solution of Mr. Stead's 
hypothetical problem If Christ Came to Chi- 
cago." Miss Addams's account of this work 
deserves, as it will undoubtedly receive, wide 
reading and taking to heart.

THE BEAUTY OF THE WORLD.* 

The translation of the late Emile Michel's 
book on " Great Masters of Landscape Paint- 
ing" is one which anyone interested in the 
subject will want to have. It covers a wide 
range, is well printed, and profusely illustrated 
with photogravure and other reproductions, not 
only of pictures but of drawings from many 
private as well as public collections, and is by 
a well-known authority. 

Owing to his general plan M. Michel was 
forced to omit one development in landscape 
painting that id now rather important. He in- 
cluded in his work no living artists, and there- 
fore of the so-called " impressionists " or "plein- 
air " landscapists he was able to mention only 
Sisley. Those students who feel that a work 
on landscape must omit a good deal when it 
omits Monet, Pissarro, and Ce'zanne, not to 
speak of many others, may remedy the defect 
by the translation of Duret's book on the French 
Impressionists, which, though it deals with much 
beside landscape painting, considers the impres- 
sionist landscapists in quite as much detail as 
M. Michel could have done according to the 
plan of his work. 

The many who have read with instruction 
and sympathy Mr. Birge Harrison's " Land- 
scape Painting " will be interested in knowing 
that whereas Mr. Harrison says, " Not until the 
early years of the nineteenth century . . . did 
the first true school of landscape make its 
appearance," M. Michel devotes almost two- 
thirds of his book to the painters before Con- 
stable. On the other hand, the landscape- 
painter who appears to be most interesting to 
M. Michel Theodore Rousseau is merely 
alluded to once by Mr. Harrison, and then 
only in connection with two or three others. 
Another quotation from Mr. Harrison is worth

noting: "In landscape, of course, drawing is 
of secondary importance; color, refraction and 
vibration ranking first " Now while color is a 
matter of some interest to M. Michel, he 
hardly ever mentions refraction or vibration or 
anything of the sort. Such comparisons make 
pretty clear the general position of M. Michel's 
book in the present interest in landscape- 
painting. It is not a presentation of landscape 
on the basis of the ideas now generally current. 
It is a historical study of landscape as it has 
appeared in European art in the last four or 
five centuries. And as the idea of landscape 
now predominantly current is a matter chiefly 
of the last hundred years or less, it becomes clear 
that M. Michel does not omit Monet and a 
hundred others merely because they were living 
at the time he wrote. He writes the book he 
does because he was not interested in the con- 
ception of landscape art which regards vibration 
and refraction as the two chief things. He had 
other standards, among them drawing. 

His book, therefore, has much in it for one 
whose taste has been largely formed in the 
schools of the present, because though one will 
not find one's favorite artists presented and inter- 
preted (one may go to M. Duret for that) one 
will almost without a doubt be interested and 
surprised to find how much there is in the land- 
scapes of earlier days, those landscapes of the 
centuries before " the first true school of land- 
scape" made its appearance. It will be seen 
that there were great men before Alexander. 

One thing that appears to me a great defect 
in the book is the general plan, which is chiefly 
individual or often biographical. That was, of 
course, M. Michel's idea and desire : he calls 
his book the " Great Masters." Now much 
may be done by a study of the great land- 
scapists of all time, and doubtless M. Michel 
knew just what he wished to accomplish. But 
much more interesting, to my mind, than a 
study of the lives, even of the works and the 
genius, of different artists, is a presentation 
which includes some study of developments and 
tendencies, a history of art, in fact. Perhaps 
we have heard so much of developments and 
tendencies of taste that people are tired of them 
and will be glad to read something that is 
frankly individual and biographical. But the 
matter is not merely a matter of taste : it has 
a more practical element. For instance, M. 
Michel has half a page on Salvator Rosa and a 
page on Wilson : there is little more than a 
mention of each. This is natural enough from 
his standpoint, for Salvator is certainly not one

of the masters of landscape with whom, for the 
beauty of his own work, we should want to 
have much to do ; and although there are many 
things by Wilson that are charming, yet one 
can see how a Frenchman whose mind was full 
of Claude would not consider him very im- 
portant. But both men were undeniable in- 
fluences. To us in America they are more 
interesting than elsewhere, for there can be 
little doubt that the pictures of Wilson, and to 
a less degree of Salvator, were a real inspiration 
to Thomas Cole and the first American land- 
scapists, not to mention American writers and 
men of general culture. Doubtless M. Michel 
was not at all interested in Cole and his inspir- 
ations, or in American landscape, but it was 
not by any means in America alone that Salvator 
was an influence, or Wilson either. So I feel 
a lack in this book which comes, doubtless, 
from looking in it for what M. Michel did not 
care to put there. 

If the reader will look at the book for what 
is there he will find much that he will like. 
Here is an appreciative and thorough account 
of the Barbizon painters ; here, as one would 
expect, is a thoroughly sympathetic treatment 
of Nicolas Poussin and of Claude ; here is a 
full dealing with Ruysdael, Hobbema, and the 
Flemish and Dutch.* These things one would 
expect, but there are other matters not so 
obvious. One is a matter of method. It 
surely is excellent in M. Michel to study land- 
scape not only with his eye on the picture but on 
thescene. Here we have the so-called '"Tempest " 
of Giorgione compared with a photograph of 
Castlefranco ; we have a consideration of Titian 
on the basis of the photographs and sketches 
of the country about Cadore ; we have the 
already known comparison of some of the land- 
scapes of Ruysdael with the localities them- 
selves. I am sorry that M. Michel did not go 
further in this way, for it seems to me to be full 
of possibilities, not for identification only, 
but to help us form an idea of what the painter 
had in his mind to give us in his picture. It 
is something like a comparison of Shakespeare's 
plays with their sources, a study that may easily 
become dry and lifeless, but which is also sus- 
ceptible of real gain in dramatic appreciation. 
In studying American landscapists, in partic- 
ular, such a method has its advantages, one of 
which is that it is not difficult to do a good deal 

* Cf. Mr. Harrison, p. 28 : " Thanks to them [the luini- 
narists] it is not possible for the worst of our modern land- 
scapists to use such distressing color as is to be found in the 
best of the Hobbemas and Cuyps and Ruysdaels of the 
sixteenth century." 



in identifying localities and seeing what a man 
has made of them. 

It must be allowed, however, that such a 
means runs easily into the descriptive or the 
historical, and this is M. Michel's especial field ; 
indeed, his criticism is too often apt to lack 
artistic quality. He often speaks of the senti- 
ment or the idea of a painter, and often, too, of 
his technical means. But these things somehow 
fail to give one the painter's quality. Velasquez, 
he says, " is unique as a painter." Doubtless : 
but I at least feel the truth of this remark more 
on looking at the two pictures of the Villa Medici 
in the Prado, or rather at their reproductions, 
than "by reading M. Michel's criticism. But 
M. Michel's position has been long known, and 
there is no reason why I should try to define 
it. His book certainly gathers together an 
immense amount that will delight any lover of 
landscape. 

In turning to the Impressionistic landscapists 
in M. Duret's book,, one thing will be immedi- 
ately obvious of which the cause is significant. 
The pictures give by no means so pleasing an 
impression as those of the other book. In fact, 
some of the impressionist pictures look very 
childish, for instance, the " Pay sage " of 
Cezanne, or one or two by Monet. None of the 
pictures in M. Michel's book look childish except 
the very early ones : even the pictures of some 
lesser-known Dutch painter, say Van Goyen, 
do not look childish at all. The reason for this 
is as plain as the fact, and it is a characteristic 
matter. In the newer landscapists drawing is 
of less importance than some other things, 
for example, vibration ; and while drawing is 
something that can be well reproduced by a 
photograph, vibration cannot. The means taken 
by the impressionists to gain by painting the 
especial effects that they desire are such as 
cannot be reproduced in some totally different 
medium. You cannot give a good idea of 
Richard Strauss's orchestration on a pianola. 
In other words the impressionists are aiming at 
very different effects from the landscapists of 
earlier years. Even Constable, Crome, Cotman, 
or Rousseau, Corot, Millet, though acknow- 
ledged by the moderns to be great painters of 
landscape, did not have the same aims as the 
present. People now look in landscape for 
things very different from those which charmed 
preceding generations. They want form, com- 
position, values, as people always have; but 
they also want, and want more, light, vibration, 
actuality. And these new elements in landscape 
are so potent that their presence or absence 



464 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 1, 



outweighs all other things put together when it 
comes to quality. Hence the impressionist is 
indifferent to subject in so far as associations 
are concerned, or picturesqueness. He finds an 
ordinary hillside with a house on it as good a 
subject as a craggy precipice with a romantic 
old castle. In fact it is better as a subject; 
for there will be no story or association to dis- 
tract attention from the light and the feeling 
of reality and the atmosphere which he wishes 
to give. There are many things in Nature, and 
when one is accustomed to her freshness and 
brilliancy, or her softness and delicacy, one is 
not satisfied by a number of other things which 
sometimes are not in Nature at all. Whether 
this is for the best or not, we need not discuss 
here. An understanding of the fact shows the 
difference between the impressionist landscape 
and every other landscape that has preceded it. 
The others may be beautiful, they often are, 
and a landscape that was beautiful in the time 
of Giorgione will generally have preserved its 
beauty to-day, but the landscape beauty of 
to-day is something that the older masters did 
not think of. 

M. Duret's book is on " Manet and the 
French Impressionists," and half the book is on 
Manet, who was not a painter of landscape. He 
was, however, often enough a painter of out-of- 
doors, and of his pictures here reproduced, Le 
Dejeuner sur 1'Herbe" is quite as much of a 
landscape as the picture of Giorgione which 
inspired it. And whether landscapist or not, 
Manet was full of the feeling and ideal which 
afterward appeared in the pictures of Monet 
and Pissarro. So the whole book will be inter- 
esting to the student of landscape. As we have 
said, the impressionist landscapes do not always 
lend themselves to reproduction, but with this 
necessary drawback the book is handsomely 
illustrated with etchings, wood-engravings, and 
half-tones. 

It is an inspiring thing to read these books 
and get an idea of the beauty of nature as it 
has moved the genius of so many artists. If 
one read them this Winter, one will see more 
that is delightful next Summer, if not before.

The striking, the picturesque, the tragic, 
comic, or otherwise significant aspect of things 
which men of the brush and pencil have a way 
of seeing and of reproducing by their art, they 
also not infrequently possess the knack of 
picturing with their pen in a manner highly 
stimulating and refreshing to their render-,. If 
Thackeray and Du Maurier had not l>een 
draughtsmen before they were writers, how 
much less might have been their success in the 
literary world! Although Mr. Elihu Vedder 
repeatedly and unaffectedly disclaims all literary 
skill, his autobiography, the rich and varied 
record of his seventy-four years of going to and 
fro in the earth and walking up and down in it, 
painting the while as well as doing thousands of 
other things, is incomparably the most diverting 
book of the season so far as the season's 
books have come to the present writer's notice. 

"The Digressions of V.," as the author 
humorously names his autobiographical recol- 
lections, may indeed occasionally remind some 
older readers of Artemus Ward's familiar way 
of deserting the topic of his lecture to expatiate 
on sundry irrelevant matters casually called to 
mind, until the evening was found to have sped 
and the announced lecture had to be postponed. 
But it is with Mr. Vedder as with Artemus : 
whatever the drift of his discourse, one could 
not possibly wish him to be talking about any- 
thing else in the world than just what is actually 
claiming his attention, and his listener's. A bit 
of original verse on the half-title-page indicates 
the book's purpose : 

"Somewhat o'ershadowed by great names, 

A feeble plant he tries to rear; 
It is not nourished by great aims 

Nor yet retarded by much fear; 
His aims if any are but these, 
To be remembered and to please." 
The title-page itself sets forth the nature of 
what is to come, thus : 

" Containing the quaint legends of his infancy, an 
account of his stay in Florence, the garden of lost 
opportunities, return home on the track of Columbus, 
his struggle in New York in war-time coinciding \s itli 
that of the nation, his prolonged stay in Koine, and 
likewise his prattlings upon art, tamperiugs with liter- 
ature, struggles with verse, and many other things, 
being a portrait of himself from youth to age." 
In his Introduction Mr. Vedder deplores his 
lack of a Boswell, his experience convincing 
him that full many a spark of wit is struck to

flash unseen, and waste its brilliance on the 
family air ; and therefore, faute de mieux, he 
decides to be his own Boswell, and also to tell 
his story in plain and simple language. "Apro- 
pos of hard words," he explains, " I frequently 
tell of the Frenchman who disliked tomatoes. 
He said he was glad of it, for if he liked them, 
he would eat them whereas he detested them. 
It is the same with me in regard to hard words. 
I don't like them ; luckily I know but few ; if 
I knew many more I would use them, whereas 
I detest them, or at least regard them with 
apprehension. ' 

The author's name is in itself enough to indi- 
cate his Dutch descent. Schenectady was the 
American cradle of his race, and its members 
intermarried to an extent that would now alarm 
the apostle of eugenics, but that then seems to 
have had no worse effects than the generating 
of strong, not to say idiosyncratic, characters 
in considerable numbers. One of these was a 
grandfather, or great-grandfather, of the artist, 
who never allowed his religion to give him a 
moment's concern, because he knew his damna- 
tion or election was already irrevocably deter- 
mined, and there was no use in worrying. On 
the day of his death he took care to have the 
clock wound as usual, wound his watch, and 
announced that he was going to die at three 
o'clock. Had death failed to keep the appoint- 
ment he would have been much put out, says 
his grandson. It was in New York, however, 
not in Schenectady, that Elihu, son of Elihu 
and Elizabeth (Vedder) Vedder, was born on 
the 26th of February, 1836. Of the various 
homes he knew in boyhood, on Long Island and 
in Cuba, as well as in New York and Schenect- 
ady, and of the successive schools to which he 
was sent and where he was exposed to the more 
or less imminent danger of catching an educa- 
tion, and of all the pranks he engaged in and 
the narrow escapes he had from sundry sorts of 
violent death, there is no space here to tell. 
These things, with hundreds more, must be read 
in the writer's own words and with the artist's 
own drawings. A brief passage from an early 
page will show what bent was early given to 
his mind in religious matters. 

"I am writing of long ago. At that time, as a 
matter of course, all good Christians quarreled among 
themselves, at least in Schenectady, but united most 
harmoniously in persecuting the poor Universalists. In 
Schenectady it was like the early days of the Church. 
We met almost furtively, and the windows of the 
humble little chapel were constantly broken by stones, 
thrown, sometimes, during the meetings. And all this 
because they, the Universalists, held that a good God 
would never create any one for endless torture." 



A few pages later he relates an ingenious but 
unanswerable question which he had put to an 
orthodox Sunday-school teacher, and which the 
latter could not answer without stultifying him- 
self or incriminating the Deity. " My child," 
replied the teacher, " you are too young to 
understand such things ; when you get older, 
all that will be explained." " I am still wait- 
ing for the explanation, still too young, per- 
haps," adds the author. 

The turn that his artistic impulse later took 
toward the not infrequent representation of the 
weird, the gruesome, the shuddersome, may 
perhaps be partly accounted for by the follow- 
ing boyhood experience: 

" In this quiet street there had been a very old grave- 
yard; but progress, even in that quiet spot, had made 
its appearance, and it was decreed that the graveyard 
must be removed. And so it happened that I had a 
glimpse of an uncle that I had never known. Why I 
went, or who too* me, I have forgotten, but shall never 
forget what I saw. We had to go some distance out 
of town ; it was a cold day, under a gloomy sky, that we 
climbed the bleak hillside until we could see beneath 
us the ice-blocked river and the flooded, snow-covered 
flats fading away into the distance. From afar off, 
borne on the wind, came the tooting of a distant engine, 
a most desolate sound. At our feet, on the frozen 
ground, was a broken and decayed coffin with tne lid 
gone, and in it a tall skeleton to which clung bits of 
shroud that fluttered in the chilly wind, and this was, 
or had been, my Uncle Uri. A strange meeting, indeed! 
And then back to the cheerful town and the warm fire- 
side leaving him out there alone." 

Strange and mysterious things were con- 
stantly occurring in the Vedder family. For 
example, the mother, after having the time of 
her death predicted years before by a fortune- 
teller, and after the foolish augury had been 
aJl but forgotten by those interested in it, was 
actually taken ill at the appointed time and, 
through the carelessness of an aged doctor who 
forgot to prescribe a strengthening diet when 
the crisis was past, fell a victim to medical 
neglect and died of innutrition. The announce- 
ment of her death caused her son Elihu to faint 
away, for the only time in his life, so deep and 
strong was his attachment to her. 

His art education, it is significant to note, was 
largely self -education. At the Atelier Picot, in 
Paris, whither the young man betook himself 
in 1856, " the instruction consisted," as we read, 
" in a little old man with a decoration coming 
twice a week and saying to each one of us, ' Pas 
mail Pas mail' and going away again. But 
we got instruction from the older students, got 
it hot and heavy and administered in the most 
sarcastic way." Further, the author goes on : 

" Who can tell of the workings of Fate or foretell 
anything? Had I fallen in with some of the American

students of Couture, I might have gone there and 
gotten over a faithful but fiddling little way of drawing 
which hangs around me yet, unbeknownst,' or I might 
have said in later yean with a most talented friend of 
mine, ' I wish to God I could get rid of that cut-and- 
dried Beaux-Arts style.' All that is past remedy. I 
was only in Paris eight months, drawing from plaster 
easts, and left because Rhodes left, and I wanted to 
see Italy." 

And in Italy, the author tells us, so much Art 
burst into his unprepared mind that the result- 
ing confusion has lasted for the rest of his life. 
" I studied by myself," he continues, "and some- 
times wish I hadn't, for my pictures always have 
to me a home-made air which I don't like. I 
mean, they lack the air of a period or school, and 
this I say it seriously seems to me a great 
defect." Probably it is this very " defect " of 
unoonventionality, or originality, that his ad- 
mirers most like in him. While on this topic 
of theory in art, he adds : 

" One thing I settled on that style should spring 
entirely from the subject, be appropriate to it and the 
time at your disposal, whether you were taking it by 
assault or by siege; and my idea of the aim of Art 
was first to have an idea, and then from your expe- 
riences and the nature about you get the material to 
clothe it. In fact, take a soul and give it body ; this in 
my case has not been a cold-blooded plan of action, 
but merely the expression of my nature. I am not the 
discoverer of this idea, however." 

Contrasting his style as artist with his style 
as writer of his own life, the author remarks on 
the peculiar fondness he has for painting land- 
scapes with no figures, whereas in wandering 
through the hazy past he finds himself always 
writing about the figures and not about the 
landscape. " Is it," he asks, " because I have 
been so awfully bored by long descriptions of 
beautiful scenes and health-giving air which only 
the writer can afford to either see or breathe? 
Or that Nature is always in dead earnest, ex- 
cept in kittens and puppies?" Dead earnest 
is, happily, often absent from Mr. Vedder's 
mirthful pages. 

Referring to one of his best-known works, 
he writes: 

I have been told by those in the trade that, as an 
illustrated book, the Omar Khayyam has had a longer 
lease of life than any other book of its kind. I happen 
to know that it yet sells, and have reason for being 
glad of it. But I wonder why the book should sell. I 
am not alluding to the poem that will always sell; 
but is there something wrong about the pictures 
something Tupperish that they should have been so 
popular? A fearful thought. It cannot be the drawing 
in them, for plenty of men I do not say can, but at 
least do, draw better; therefore that cannot be the 
attraction. They take the mind, perhaps? or do they 
touch the heart ? Who knows ? The subject is too deep 
for me; I give it up, yet I wonder if that getting at 



the heart or mind is not my proper trade after all, and 
if I had not better stick to it." 

Yes, it is getting at the heart, of the reader 
no less than of the picture-viewer, that is Mr. 
Vedder's " proper trade." In his book he ap- 
peals to the unspoiled human nature that i.- in 
us, and reveals himself as unmistakably human 
and large-hearted and lovable, generously en- 
dowed with desirable qualities from those sturdy 
and enterprising Dutch pioneers of the Mohawk 
valley, and richly possessed of all that comes 
to him who lives a long and full life worthily 
and well. Such scanty quotations and conden- 
sations as have been given above can convey 
no adequate notion of the charm of the author's 
digressive narrative, and hardly a word has 
been said of the abundant and always character- 
istic and appropriate illustrations, which are 
sometimes reproductions of the artist's more 
celebrated paintings, sometimes sketches made 
expressly for the book. There are many pecu- 
liarities in the cover-design, the title page, and 
elsewhere, that are eminently Veddt-n-sqiu'. 
Scarcely ever, in fact, has a man put more of 
himself into his book than has this artist-author 
crammed into the generous bulk of " The 
Digressions of V." PERCY F. BICKNELL. 



THE NEWEST BOOK OF PARIS.* 

Disdaining to enter into competition with 
Baedeker, the most recent author of a " Book 
of Paris " has undertaken the pleasant task in 
some such spirit as Thackeray used in his 
"Sketch Books." It is true that Mr. Claude 
C. Washburn takes himself far more seriously 
than Thackeray ever took himself; and takes 
less pains to make sure his little asides are truly 
interesting. That is a mere detail. Both thr 
Victorian and the American write "personal' 
volumes. And the later-comer tells us, with 
perfect veracity, that " Paris is not the subject 
of the book : Paris is only the medium." The 
subject is life : " and whatever, good or bad, 
has any bearing upon life is found somewhere 
in its pages." It may sound unduly patron i/iu; 
to hint that it is unfortunate that Mr. Wash- 
burn has already given us his " Book of Paris," 
instead of keeping it by him to rewrite, and 
delete, and enrich. Yet it is certain that in 
taste and in true knowledge of life he will in 
the years to come greatly increase, or at least

that is to be devoutly wished and hoped for. A 
travel-book of the conventional sort Mr. Wash- 
burn is amply qualified to produce. It is only 
this fuller and more ambitious kind of writing 
that he is hardly " up to." In feeling that 
Mr. Washburn could have greatly improved 
his book and made it altogether good reading 
which it is not as it stands I judge, in part, by 
the intolerant common-sense of his "exposure" 
of so-called bohemianism ; by the delightful 
passage on the Faubourg St. Germain ; by the 
exquisitely humorous account of a motor-bus 
journey from Montmartre to the Left Bank 
such a journey as my Uncle Toby himself might 
well have taken, in company with his diverting 
nephew, had he lived long enough to be shaken 
about in a motor-bus. If the "Book of Paris" 
were not, even as it stands, the most striking 
book recently published on the subject of so 
many books, I should not have been tempted to 
write about it at such length, and with so many 
qualifying phrases. As a matter of fact, it is 
when he almost succeeds in getting the better 
of his very troublesome self-consciousness that 
Mr. Washburn interests his reader. " Oh, for 
the poet great enough to convince us of the 
nobility and the glory of eating when we are 
really hungry !" he exclaims on a page that we 
could well do without. This is, in his own 
phrase, de la litterature : and not good litera- 
ture. Neither is what follows : 

"We reserve the splendor of our verse for love; but 
there is not half the high satisfaction in being in love 
that there is in dining well after a hard gallop over 
country roads. I know, for I have tried both." 

Too many such pages of the " Book of Paris " 
obscure for us, through their labored crudity 
and incorrigible dilettanteism, the real excel- 
lences of the book. Anatole France is, appar- 
ently, the writer's hero among men of letters ; 
but, in spite of the " Imaginary Interview," the 
deeper culture and the native wit of M. France 
are not Mr. Washburn 's. 

This returned traveller generously spares 
us " word-paintings " of familiar monuments. 
He leaves the matter of illustration to his col- 
laborator, Mr. Lester G. Hornby. This skilful 
young American suggests Mr. Pennell fre- 
quently in his choice of subjects, rather less 
frequently, but rather more unmistakably, in 
his treatment of subjects. Some of the etchings 
and drawings which he includes in his part of the 
" Book of Paris " are no more than the promis- 
ing "studies" of an art-student en voyage. 
They want sureness of touch, and they suggest 
an absence of definite intention. But neither 



craftsmanship nor selectiveness are in every 
case absent. There are several effective street- 
scenes ; and in handling such unambitious com- 
positions as are strongest, after all, in " human 
interest," or, at any rate, homely interest 
cabs at the cab stand, for example success 
in all things but originality is attained. And 
what is originality compared with sincerity? 
In spite of his failure to spare us such messiness 
as blots his " Old Passage, Palais Royal," Mr. 
Hornby has already, when at his best, a certain 
delicacy both in impressibility and manner ; and 
a decided charm. 

The Book of Paris has often been written, 
and " by eminent hands." It has been written 
and unwritten and rewritten and it has so far 
come no nearer completion than the catalogue 
of the Bibliotheque Nationale. Yet when a 
writer of great opportunity, so far as " elegant 
leisure " goes, " settles " in Paris, how can he 
utterly fail to convey something of the city's 



enduring charm ?

NOTES OF A VETERAN PRINTSEL,L,EK.* 

The announcement of a book about the great 
engravers, from the pen of one who has acquired 
intimate knowledge of their works during forty 
years' experience as a printseller, naturally 
arouses keen expectations. It is somewhat dis- 
appointing, therefore, to find Mr. Keppel's at- 
tractively printed and profusely illustrated vol- 
ume not what its title would imply; but instead 
that it is made up, for the most part, of articles 
originally contributed to popular magazines, 
lectures delivered before the Grolier Club in 
New York, at Yale University and elsewhere, 
and of what appear to be biographical sketches 
to accompany dealers' exhibition catalogues. 
The article entitled "The Golden Age of 
Engraving," from which the book takes its 
name, was first published in " Harper's Maga- 
zine " in 1878, and has since been reprinted at 
least four times. All that Mr. Keppel has to 
say about the line engravers and their works is 
contained in this and two shorter articles, the 
three covering only thirty-five pages, while 
nearly two hundred are devoted to etching and 
etchers, and seventy to other topics. 

If the book had been called "A Veteran 
Printseller's Notes about Famous Etchers and

named. The author's style is light and chatty, 
and his pages abound in anecdotes and entertain- 
ing reminiscences. Some of these stories, hav- 
ing been used to enliven more than one of the 
articles, reappear several times in the book be- 
fore us. Judicious editing might have elimin- 
ated some of the repetitions, and certainly would 
not have permitted the printing of the following 
comment upon Mr. PennelTs work, on page 241: 

" Tli is impromptu spontaneity of Mr. Peunell'a method 
carries with it one little drawback if it be a draw- 
back at all. It is, that in his architectural scenes what 
the French call the orientation is reversed : west is east, 
and east is west. In this he follows the precedent of 
both Kenibraudt and Whistler. The sole preoccupa- 
patiou of these masters was to produce a picture, and 
they cared not at all to provide a topographical plan of 
some stated locality." 

In the same article, the reader had already 
been told, on page 234, that : 

This impromptu spontaneity of his method involves 
one little drawback if it be a drawback at all: it is 
that in his architectural drawing what the French call 
orientation is reversed ; west takes the place of east and 
south of north. But in this he follows the precedent of 
Rembrandt, Whistler, and Seymour Haden. The sole 
preoccupation of these masters was to make an artistic 
picture, and they cared nothing at all for observing the 
points of the compass." 

One of the most interesting of Mr. Keppel's 
reminiscences takes him back to his first trip to 
Europe to buy prints. 

" It did not take long for me to expend my little 
store of money, so I packed up my stock and engaged 
my passage to New York on a steamer which was to sail 
in a few days. The day following I learned that the 
greatest priutseller in all Europe could be found at 
number 109, The Strand. I went there and read on the 
signboard the name of Noseda. I entered, inquired for 
Mr. Noseda and learned that the head of the house was 
Mrs. Noseda, an elderly widow. I was introduced to 
her and found that in spite of her Italian name she was 
a good cockney who had been born to the prosy name of 
Jane Smith, and I perceived that when she spoke, the 
letter h was very uncertain in her vocabulary. I stated 
my business and said that I had spent all my money 
before I knew of her and her magnificent stock of rare 
prints. 'It might be arranged,' said Mrs. Noseda, 'if 
you 'ave good London references.' Well, I had, and 
next day I took to her three letters of which I was quite 
proud. ' What are these ? ' said she. I answered that 
they were three letters from prominent London mer- 
chants, and that these letters spoke of me as being an 
honest and industrious young man. Mrs. Noseda tore 
up the three letters unopened, dropped them into the 
fire, and said to me: * Now you may take anything and 
everything you like of my stock, and when you return 
from New York next year you shall pay me for them.' " 
To thin remarkable woman's confidence in him 
Mr. Keppel attributes his "first real start. 
She was a pronounced " character," and he 
relates several amusing anecdotes in which she 
figures. These are too long to be quoted here, 



but his description of her apparel is necessary 
to complete the picture of the first interview : 

" Anyone 'seeing her in lu-r street attire (which was 
the same at all seasons and for long year*) was not 
likely to forget her. She generally wore a yellow gown: 
her hat was of the most outlandish and flamboyant 
British style, but it was her outer garment that made 
her unforgettable. It was a satin shawl of scarlet and 
yellow, in broad alternate stripes, and it could be seen 
in the street as far as human eyesight could reach." 

Mr. Keppel's comments upon the artists 
about whom he writes, are, on the whole, sound 
and well-considered. He does not venture into 
the field of criticism, but confines himself almost 
wholly to biographical sketches, personal gossip, 
and generous words of appreciation of the artists' 
finest works. Only now and then does he at- 
tempt comparisons, as in the case of Millet's 
" The Wood Sawyers," which he rightly places 
far above the better-known " Angelus " in artistic 
merit. Occasionally his enthusiasm leads him 
to extravagant statement, as when he insists that 
etching can suggest all that {minting can. In 
the hands of a master, lines and light and dark 
masses can be made to suggest a great deal, but 
surely far less than all that it is possible for 
painting to present to the mind. This, however, 
is of little importance. The charm of a fine 
etching is not so much in what it suggests as 
in the harmonic arrangement of the lines and 
masses. Even the magic quality of touch is sec- 
ondary to the composition. Strange to say. art i>ts 
do not always keep this in mind. There arc etch- 
ings by Whistler that consist of petty details 
only, and are lacking in the general effect. 

For Whistler as an artist Mr. K.-pp. 1 has 
only unstinted praise ; and he devotes to him an 
essay on " Whistler as an Etcher," and an article 
entitled "One Day with Whistler." Both of 
these are very readable. The author, how- 
ever, makes one rather invidious and unmerited 
though perhaps unintentional distinction in 
mentioning Mr. Howard Mansfield's descriptive 
catalogue of Whistler's etchings, published by 
the Caxton Club of Chicago, and the catalogue 
compiled by Mr. E. G. Kennedy to accompany 
the portfolios of reproductions of the etc hi 
issued by the Grolier Club of New York. In 
saying that * Mr. Kennedy's book, in particular, 
is a monument of patient and intelligent lal>or" 
it is probable that Mr. Keppel meant only to 
praise the work of a rival pi -intscller. Imt the 
language used is most unfair to Mr. Mansfield, 
whose book is also the result of long and pains- 
taking research, and is the more complete of 
the two. 

The illustrations of this volume are of especial

interest. They consist of two hundred and 
sixty-two well-printed half-tone plates, chiefly 
reproductions of notable etchings and en- 
gravings, including most of the acknowledged 
masterpieces. Together they form a collection 
of very considerable utility.

BOOKS OF TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION. 

The undying appeal of Palestine has been heard 
and heeded by Mr. Robert Hichens, who, in a sumpt- 
uous volume entitled " The Holy Land," illustrated 
from paintings by Mr. Jules Guerin and from photo- 
graphs, conveys to the reader something of his delight 
in the scenes and characters there to be encountered. 
The mere sensuous charm of the region seems almost 
to intoxicate Mr. Hichens. " It is an Arcady of the 
East." he exclaims, " and of a charm to me irresistible. 
Cares drop away, are lost among the innocent wild 
flowers ; fears, anxieties disperse on the gentle, cares- 
sing breezes. Far off, at evening, the little white tent 
will welcome you ; and as you see it in the distance, 
and your horse, lifting his head and distending his 
sensitive nostrils, neighs joyously, you will bless 
from your heart the nomadic life." After a chap- 
ter devoted to Baalbec and one to Damascus, the 
author takes us from Damascus to Nazareth, from 
Nazareth to Jerusalem, and from Jericho to Bethle- 
hem. An important chapter on Jerusalem, and 
another descriptive of the Easter ceremonies at the 
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, as viewed under 
rather trying conditions by the writer, close the book. 
Similar in character to Mr. Hichens's work on 
"Egypt and its Monuments," the book is of course 
a noteworthy product of the printer's and the illus- 
trator's art, as well as a glowing piece of writing. 
Vivid effects are present in abundance, both in the 
text and in the brilliantly colored pictures by Mr. 
GueVin, who accompanied the author on his journey 
through Palestine. (Century Co.) 

Unfading is the charm of Brittany, and every 
fresh visit reveals some new phase or detail of that 
charm. Last year Miss Frances M. Gostling told 
us much that was delightful about "The Bretons at 
Home." and this year Mr. George Wharton Edwards 
has produced an elaborate volume on " Brittany 
and the Bretons " (Moffat, Yard & Co.) illustrated 
both in color and in black-and-white by himself; 
while Miss Mary J. Atkinson, in a book entitled 
" A Chateau in Brittany " (James Pott & Co.), gives 
her impressions of the country and its people. Mr. 
Edwards, rambling extensively with Mrs. Edwards 
in the byways of that unmodernized corner of France, 
has chronicled their wanderings in a style and with 
a variety of illustrative anecdote that cannot fail to 



interest. Occasional passing mention of the ancient 
superstitions of the people as, for instance, their 
steadfast abstention from blackberries because they 
believe the crown of thorns was made of blackberry 
vines helps one to realize how far removed they 
are from the twentieth-century world about them. 
The author's pictures are numerous, and their 
manner of execution is well adapted to the homely 
quaintness of their themes. So interesting are they 
that one could wish the accompanying reading mat- 
ter were more given to expatiating on or explaining 
their details. Miss Atkinson's "Chateau in Brit- 
tany" is also the record of personal experience, 
and it takes its title from the comfortable villa, or 
farm-house, at Dinard which she and her companions 
made their headquarters. The ways of the people, 
and the antiquities and legends of the country, with 
a sufficiency of historic reference, help to give 
variety to the author's account of places visited and 
sights seen. Seventeen pictures from photographs 
are scattered through the book. If now the English- 
speaking tourist does not find himself already fairly 
familiar with the Bretons and their country before 
visiting them, it will not be for lack of agreeable 
and informing literature on the subject. 

To stand in the streets of Pompeii is to feel that 
" nothing in its life became it like the leaving it." 
Never more than a second or third rate provincial 
town in its own day and generation, with no claim 
on the notice of its contemporaries in respect of art, 
letters, or men, Pompeii through its death, burial, 
and resurrection has won for itself a charm unique 
and unrivalled in the world. Not until the nineteenth 
century was well on its way did we learn much of 
Pompeii as we see it to-day. Since then, not only 
picks and spades but pens have been busy, and 
Pompeii dead enjoys a fame never known by 
Pompeii living. The traveller finds no lack of 
guide-books, the scholar no lack of archaeological 
data ; but the average stay-at-home reader will de- 
light rather in the new and satisfying volume on 
" Pompeii " by Mr. W. M. Mackenzie, published 
by Messrs. Macmillan. The author's aim is to 
reconstruct, often necessarily by suggestion or 
analysis only, the life of the old town, with suffi- 
cient explanation and account of the material to 
furnish a basis of actuality , or at least a general 
view, from different sides, of what Pompeii means. 
From what is now disclosed, much insight is gained 
into such features of Roman civilization as muni- 
cipal and domestic life, streets, trades, houses, deco- 
ration and art, public buildings and public amuse- 
ments, religion, temples, tombs, and monuments. 
It is somewhat unusual to find the name of the 
illustrator precede that of the author on the title- 
page of a book. That it does so in the present 
instance is only just to the artist, Alberto Pisa, who 
painted the twenty charming landscapes and archi- 
tectural groups that illustrate Mr. Mackenzie's text. 
These are in full-page and fairly aglow with color. 
But, brilliant and striking as they are, only a person

who has never seen Pompeii in the Spring-time will 
consider them exaggerated. 

Mr. Ernest Peixotto's qualifications for describ- 
ing and illustrating the attractions of his native 
State are a sufficient guarantee of the excellence of 
his " Romantic California " (Scribner). Seventy 
illustrations from his hand are ably reinforced with 
descriptive matter giving the artist's experiences 
and impressions in various parts of his vast and 
even yet not very well known State, and in the 
Farallones. What may be called the old-world 
charm of California especially appeals to him, as do 
also the natural beauties of its less frequented 
spots. A chapter devoted to the "Midsummer 
Jinks " of the San Francisco Bohemian Club in the 
redwood forest eighty miles north of the city, with 
some account of the recent Grove Plays, is of un- 
usual interest; as are also the chapters ''Through 
Bret Harte's Country " and " The Farallones." The 
Spanish blood in Mr. Peixotto's veins may at least 
partly account for the fondness in which he holds 
the history and the picturesque antiquities of this 
romantic land, and in expressing which his pen and 
pencil have vied with each other. The book has a 
pleasing cover-design in color and gilt ; elsewhere 
the artist confines himself to black-and-white. 

When, in wandering about London, you come 
upon a particularly quaint street, a square whose 
old houses have an unmistakable air of being historic, 
and whose little park speaks, somehow, of interest 
ing associations with by-gone days, then you long 
for a guide who is versed in all the rich tradition of 
the place, and who can tell you in detail its whole 
story. It is exactly this sort of thing that Mr. James 
S. Ogilvy does for the reader in his volume entitled 
" Relics and Memorials of London Town" (Dutton). 
Mr. Ogilvy is a painter, with a taste for quaint pic- 
turesqueness and the lore of the past. In a former 
volume he painted and described bits of London 
" City "; now he wanders over a wider area, search- 
ing not so much for beauty or architectural import- 
ance as for storied interest. But he finds beauty too, 
of a kind the London kind, as the fifty colored 
plates in this book testify. Lincoln's Inn Fields 
and Portsmouth Street, Gray's Inn, the neighbor- 
hoods of St. Clement Danes and St Mary-le-Strand, 
Drury Lane, Covent Garden, Charing Cross, Soho 
Square, Bethnal Green, these are a few of the 
many localities whose history Mr. Ogilvy relates 
and whose traditions he has carefully sifted, finding 
his greatest difficulty to be the curious confusion of 
characters from novels or ballads with real people. 
The book is naturally too large to be used as a guide 
on the spots described ; but as preface or appendix 
to a London visit it would be difficult to find a more 
delightful volume. 

To Mr. Clifton Johnson's " American Highways 
and Byways " series is now added a volume on 
"The Rocky Mountains" (Macmillan). The au- 
thor's camera has here, as usual with him, aided 
and abetted his pen with excellent effect More 
than sixty scenes from animate and inanimate 



nature, including human nature in divers types, are 
faithfully reproduced. Tin- fifteen chatty chapters 
of the book take the reader on a pleasant ramble 
through North and South Dakota, New Mexico, 
Oklahoma, Colorado, Nebraska, Montana, Wyom- 
ing, Kansas, Texas, Utah, and the Yellowstone 
National Park. The cyclone cellar on the plains 
where the wind will blow the buttons off a man's 
coat, besides doing more serious mischief, the 
I pioneer farmer holding the plough while his faithful 
helpmate leads the horse, and the fast-disappearing 
Indian tepee, with types of redskin humanity, are 
objects of interest to the author and to his readers. 
With tact and skill Mr. Johnson secures from the 
natives much racy and informing talk on local mat- 
ters and on the history of the region, so that a large 
part of his narrative is printed in quotation marks 
and has the agreeably broken-up appearance of 
conversation. 

Professor Oscar Kuhns, a lover of Swit/.erland 
by virtue of his descent from Swiss ancestors and 
of summer vacations and several longer sojourns 
amid the Swiss mountains, is the author of an his- 
torical and descriptive volume entitled Switzer- 
land : Its Scenery, History, and Literary Associa- 
tions " (Crowell). Its strongest appeal is to the 
mountain-climber and the mountain-lover, abound- 
ing as it does in the adventures of famous Alpine 
explorers, in stories of landslides and other stirring 
incidents among the mountains, and in pictorial and 
verbal presentation of the glories and the sublimities 
encountered on every hand in this " playground 
of Europe." Edward Whymper's conquest of 
the Matterhorn in 1865, with the fearful acci- 
dent attending that achievement, is well, though 
briefly, related. As the author has several times 
made Geneva his home, attending courses at the 
University and making-excursions into the surround- 
ing country, he has had ample opportunity to possess 
himself of the spirit and traditions of the country. 
Illustrations, print, and binding are in keeping with 
the excellence of the reading matter. 

In these days when so many tourists consider a 
camera a necessary part of their equipment, there 
will be plenty of interested readers for such a book 
as Mr. W. I. Lincoln Adams's " Photographing in 
Old England, with Some Snap Shots in Scotland 
and Wales " (Baker & Taylor Co.). Mr. Adams is 
editor of "The Photographic Times," and manifestly 
is skilled in the taking of sun-pictures, as well as 
experienced in the art of sight-seeing. The des- 
criptive matter that divides his large pages with 
the beautiful views to which it relates, originally 
appeared in the paper which he edits, as did also 
the illustrations. Sixteen full-page plates are inter- 
spersed among the more numerous smaller pictures ; 
all are fine specimens of photography and of half- 
tone reproduction, though a few are credited to other 
cameras than the author's. The scenes photographed 
lie chiefly along the Thames from Windsor to 
Oxford; in Warwickshire; in Devonshire: in the 
Lake Country: in London: in Wales ami Scotland;

and in various cathedral towns. A chapter of per- 
tinent advice to itinerant amateur photographers 
concludes the book. 

" The Father of Waters," and the vast valley it 
drains, has proved a fruitful theme to Mr. Julius 
Chambers in his large and profusely illustrated 
octavo, " The Mississippi and its Wonderful Valley " 
(Putnam). Since his first passage over the twenty- 
seven hundred and seventy-five miles of the mighty 
stream, from its source to the sea, the river has 
become to Mr. Chambers a veritable enthusiasm, as 
he informs his readers ; " dwellers along its banks 
have become his friends and associates ; mere towns 
when first known to him have grown into prosper- 
ous cities." Beginning with " the era of fable," he 
sets forth in not too great detail about all that is 
known or knowable concerning the Mississippi in 
early times. In addition to the historic and the pic- 
turesque aspects of the river, its industrial or com- 
mercial importance is duly considered, one of the 
most interesting chapters treating of the proposed 
deep waterway for large steamers from Chicago to 
the Gulf. Views and portraits and maps in good 
number are scattered through the book, which in 
workmanship is worthy of its theme. 

" Oxford and Cambridge, delineated by Hanslip 
Fletcher" (Wessels & Bissell Co.) presents in 
sixty-one large plates, and in an historical introduc- 
tion and other descriptive and historical articles by 
various competent writers, the beauties and the 
antiquities of the two venerable seats of learning in 
England. An agreeable change from the prevalent 
half-tone photographic picture is the hand-executed 
illustration of Mr. Fletcher. Some of his work is in 
pen and ink, while other examples appear to be 
wash-drawings of some sort ; but all are executed 
with wonderful minuteness of detail and also with 
excellent general effect. The various colleges are 
adequately represented, and the descriptive matter 
is in each instance contributed by a fellow or other 
member of the college in question ; while the 
Registrary of Cambridge writes the general intro- 
duction, in which most readers will find much that 
is new to them and interesting. The book is dur- 
ably, flexibly, and neatly bound. 

The leisurely and book-loving traveller in War- 
wickshire and London could find few better com- 
panions for his wanderings than Mr. William Winter 
in his long since famous work, " Shakespeare's 
England." The gradual outgrowth of a number of 
visits to the old country, the book took its present 
name and something of its present form in 1888, and 
under that name " it has passed through more than 
twenty-five printings," as the author, with pardonable 
pride, announces in his preface to a new and still 
further enlarged edition, handsomely published by 
Messrs. Moffat, Yard & Co. Incidentally, this new 
issue has a personal or biographical interest from 
the author's endeavor, " while eliminating repeti- 
tions, to express, wherever essential, the different 
moods and emotions awakened, in the same ob- 
server's mind, by different visits to the same place." 



Thirty-one views from photographs supplement the 
text and please the eye. 

A striking memento of the San Francisco earth- 
quake and fire comes from the publishing house of 
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co. It is in the form of a 
volume, quarto size, of heavy brown paper, the right- 
hand pages serving as card-board mounts to beauti- 
fully tinted photographs of the ruined and of the 
resurgent city, and the left-hand pages bearing 
verses inspired by the accompanying views. " The 
Vanished Ruin Era : San Francisco's Classic Artis- 
try of Ruin Depicted in Picture and Song, by Louis 
J. Stellmann " so runs the title-page. The brown 
tint of the illustrations matches the brown paper 
upon which the book is printed, and the objects 
photographed are chosen with an artist's eye. The 
metrical accompaniment, pitched in a minor key of 
tender regret, is pleasing and appropriate. The 
volume is stoutly bound in buckram and boards. 

A series of handsome volumes dealing with 
" Beautiful England " has been undertaken by 
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co. Mr. Ernest W. Hasle- 
hust furnishes the colored illustrations, and Messrs. 
Edward Thomas, Walter Jerrold, A. G. Bradley, 
Canon Danks, and others write short and chatty 
descriptions of the places and buildings represented. 
The six volumes now ready are entitled " Oxford," 
"The English Lakes," "Canterbury," " Shakespeare- 
Land," "The Thames," and "Windsor Castle." 
Not as formal guide-books, but rather as dainty 
souvenirs of scenes visited or read about, will these 
agreeable volumes prove their worth. 

The freshness of first impressions and the inti- 
macy of family letters are combined in Mrs. Agness 
Greene Foster's "By the Way" (Paul Elder), 
which is made up of " travel letters written during 
several journeys abroad, describing sojourns in En- 
gland, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Austria- 
Hungary, Italy, Greece, and European and Asiatic 
Turkey," with many illustrations from photographs. 
The book is really a new edition, with added letters 
on Germany, Austria-Hungary, Greece, and Turkey, 
of a little volume published seven years ago. An 
" Index of Places, with name of hotel or pension " 
and an "Index of Authors and Books Mentioned" 
have also been added. 

Six deservedly popular books of travel, which 
have appeared within the last two or three years, are 
now offered by the publishers, Messrs. Little, Brown, 
& Co., in new editions of attractive appearance and 
moderate price. Two are by Mrs. Anna Bowman 
Dodd: "Falaise, the Town of the Conqueror/' and 
" Three Normandy Inns." Mr. Henry C. Shelley is 
also the author of two volumes : " Untrodden English 
Ways," and "Literary By-Paths in Old England"; 
and the remaining two are Mr. Samuel Adams 
Drake's " New England Legends and Folklore in 
Prose and Poetry," and Miss Lilian Whiting's 
" Italy, the Magic Land." All the volumes are 
attractively illustrated, and boxed ; and all deserve, 
in their new and popular-priced form, a large ac- 
cession of readers.

HOI.II- w KDITIOXS OP STANDARD LITERATUBE. 

Highly elaborate and wholly in harmony with 
the spirit of the poem is the artistic accompaniment 
prepared by Mr. Willy Pogrfny for "The Rime of 
the Ancient Mariner" (Crowell). The text itself, 
in a rather profusely ornamented black-letter, with 
initial letters of more or less intricate design, and 
with a generous use of colored scroll-work, presents 
the appearance of an illuminated manuscript It 
is, we infer, from the same hand that executed the 
many illustrations, mostly in color, that fill about 
half the volume. Weird, fantastic, and gruesome 
are some of the artist's conceptions, while others 
have a lightness and grace difficult to describe. 
Like delicate water-color paintings, with here and 
there a suggestion of Turner in the treatment of 
shimmering ocean or haze-enveloped ship, these 
more airy productions are of the very stuff that 
dreams are made of, even as the others are trans- 
lated nightmares. Each page has both marginal 
decorations of elaborate pattern, and also, running 
over the page, a faintly-tinted design wherein 
crawling things and snake-like vines have much to 
do. The albatross is skilfully worked in as an 
occasional ornamental feature. The front cover, 
the half-title, and the title-page are splendid with 
gilt and scroll-work and rich colors. A page of 
Latin from Thomas Burnet's " Archaeologise Phil- 
osophicie " effectively precedes the poem, and a 
part of the Lord's Prayer, likewise in Latin, follows 
it. Without question, this is the most elaborate 
and the most beautiful edition of the ''Ancient 
Mariner " ever published. 

In sumptuous form, beautifully printed on heavy 
paper, and lavishly illustrated in color, with other 
decorative features, M. Joseph Bedier's version of 
the Tristram and Isenlt legend makes its appear- 
ance in an English translation from the pen of Miss 
Florence Simmonds. <( The Romance of Tristram 
and Iseult" (Lippincott) in its present version forms 
a very readable love story, told in modern phrase but 
with much of the naive manner of the original frag- 
ment from the hand of Beroul. To the translation 
of this fragment (about 3000 lines) M. Bexlier added 
from various sources, or supplied outright, what 
was necessary to make a complete and connected 
narrative. In a brief introduction to the work M. 
Gaston Paris says: "The element which attracted 
the French romancers in the story and tempted them 
to clothe it in the consecrated form of octosyllabic 
verses, in spite of all its difficulties and obscurities, 
was the element which secured the success of their 
undertaking and gave an unprecedented popularity 
to the legend as soon as it became familiar to the 
Romano-Germanic world: the idea of the fatality 
of love, which raises it above all laws. This idea, 
incarnated in these two exceptional beings, is the 
more sympathetic to the hearts of men and women 
here, because it is purified by suffering and sancti- 
fied by death." The colored pictures by M. Maurice 
Lalau are in harmony with the romance, and the 



English translation is admiral.lv smooth and just 
enough tinctured \\ith archaism. 

It is one hundred and forty years .since (iolil- 
smith's "Deserted Village" first appeared, in a 
quarto of thirty-two pages, with a steel engraving 
on the title-page. Subsequent editions, three of 
which appeared within little over a month of tin- 
first issue, are of course too numerous to mention: 
but the quarto reprint, copiously illustrated both in 
color and in black-and-white by Mr. W. Lee Hankey, 
published in this country by Messrs. Dodd, Mead iv 
Co., has merits, artistic and typographical, belonging 
to few if any of its predecessors. In forty colored 
plates and about as many uncolored drawings the 
artist has well caught the spirit of the poem and 
reproduced its homely rural scenes and characters. 
With few exceptions the coloring of the plates is 
subdued enough to be natural and pleasing, and 
the drawing is excellent A short introduction by 
" T. S." gives the circumstances attending the writing 
and publishing of the poem, with a few contemporary 
estimates of its merits. To lovers of Goldsmith, no 
more acceptable gift of its kind could be presented. 

Mr. Edmund Dulac has once more been fortunate 
in securing exactly the right material on which to 
exercise the magic of his art The Sleeping 
Beauty and Other Fairy Tales" have been freely 
translated from the Cabinet des Fees by that sym- 
pathetic raconteur of old stories, Sir Arthur (^uiiler- 
Couch, who also contributes a charming preface about 
the Cabinet des Fees and Perrault and Madame de 
Villeneuve, authors of the four tales here chosen 
from its mine of riches. Mr. DulacVnew pictures 
have a touch of drollery like those he made for the 
" Arabian Nights," more than a touch of the romance 
and mysticism of his " Rubaiyat " illustrations, and 
a fairy-like daintiness and delicacy of design and 
coloring that is all their own. They are, of com -. 
beautifully reproduced. The text is handsomely 
printed on wide-margined pages of fine proportion, 
and the binding is tasteful and of appropriate 
design. (Hodder & Stoughton.) 

Miss Mitford's and Anna Maria Hall's rural 
sketches are drawn upon for two holiday books 
" Sketches of English Life and Character" and "Tales 
of Irish Life and Character," both with the McClurg 
imprint The first is ascribed to Mai \ I-;. Mit- 
ford, author of 'Our Village."' Of course Mary 
Russell Mitford's "Our Village" is a well-known 
work, and the natural inference that these revamped 
"Sketches" are taken therefrom is found to be 
correct: but there has been such jumping about 
among the five original series of the work, with not 
too scrupulous retention of the original titles, as to 
make identification rather difficult Why the book 
could not have been published as a selection from 
" Our Village," rather than as by the (misnamed) 
author of "Our Village," will puzzle the plain 
reader, who will also be perplexed by the lack of 
connection between the reading matter and the " six- 
teen reproductions from the paintings of Stanhope 
A. Forbes, A. R. A." The pictures are pleasing.

however, and rural in theme. They are all hrightly 
colored. The " Tales of Irish Life and Character, 
by Mrs. S. C. Hall," are chiefly selected from Mrs. 
Hall's " Sketches of Irish Character," a work now 
about eighty years old and probably not unworthy of 
a revival. In this instance again, the colored "re- 
productions from the paintings of Erskine Nicol, 
R.S.A.," have no close reference to the text which 
they adorn. But the two volumes make pretty 
picture-books, and the reprinted sketches have not 
spoiled with age. 

It was a happy thought that sent Mr. Clifton 
Johnson with his camera to Walden Pond to pro- 
cure illustrations for a new edition of Thoreau's 
best-known book. "Walden" appears in the same 
handsome form as " Cape Cod " and " The Maine 
Woods," from the hands of the same illustrator and 
the same publishers (Crowell & Co.). Thirty-three 
full page views, not only of Walden in different 
aspects and the site of Thoreau's hut, but also of 
memorable spots in the village of Concord, are 
scattered through the volume. A short introduction 
by Mr. Johnson gives, among other information, the 
ultimate fate of the hermitage, of which no good 
picture seems to have been available for the present 
edition of "Walden." Both for those that have and 
for those that lack " a pretty good supply of inter- 
nal sunshine," this record of a two-years' cheerful 
solitude, spent in simple labors of the body and 
healthful exercises of the mind, will always be in- 
vigorating reading. " To read well," says Thoreau 
in the book under discussion, " that is, to read true 
books in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one 
that will task the reader more than any exercise 
which the customs of the day esteem." 

If the humor of the " Pickwick Papers " needs 
any bait to tempt present-day readers, it is provided 
in Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton's reprint, wherein 
are to be found some of the Club's adventures, under 
the title " Mr. Pickwick : Pages from the Pickwick 
Papers." The book is rather bulky to read from, 
but this disadvantage is offset by the large clear 
type. And whoever takes it up merely to look at 
the pictures will shortly find himself too much 
amused by them not to dip into the story. Mr. 
Frank Reynolds is the artist. His humor is more 
genial than that of the early illustrators, and a 
large page and the use of color give him an excel- 
lent opportunity to depict his conception of the 
Pickwickians, their friends, and their experiences 
in a fashion at once telling and decorative. 

Mr. Rudyard Kipling's "Collected Verse" 
the author's own selection of the work by which he 
wishes to be finally represented is the basis of a 
handsomely-made holiday volume with illustrations 
by the English colorist, Mr. W. Heath Robinson. 
Mr. Kipling's imagination is peculiarly difficult to 
match pictorially. It demands boldness both in 
coloring and conception; and the fall from the 
interestingly grotesque to the mere absurd is easy. 
Mr. Robinson attempts everything the singing 
souls of the "jolly, jolly mariners," the Explorer 



insane in the desert, Tomlinson gripped by a spirit 
hand, the " Ford o' Kabul River " with its floating 
dead. All the pictures are interesting, but many 
give most strongly the impression of being attempts 
at the impossible. 

"Tom Sawyer" needs no commendatory word 
from the reviewer's pen. Nevertheless the new 
edition issued by the Harpers, with sixteen excellent 
illustrations by Mr. Worth Brehm, is so attractive 
that it cannot be passed over in silence. Tom him- 
self is admirably conceived by the artist, who shows 
him to us in some very convincing attitudes, 
whitewashing his Aunt Polly's fence, showing off 
before the blue-eyed, yellow-haired girl in Jeff 
Thatcher's garden, relating his adventures to a 
spellbound circle of admirers, and so on. But there 
is one detail in the first-named picture that is 
wrong : the fresh whitewash from Tom's brush is 
represented as beautifully and brilliantly white, 
whereas every whitewash artist knows that the 
white shows only after the wash is dry. But Mr. 
Brehm may plead artistic license; and his good work 
in other respects has earned him our indulgence. 

Browning's " Pippa Passes " and the group of 
lyrics called " Men and Women " are brought to- 
gether in a small clearly-printed volume in flexible 
leather binding, with ten colored illustrations by 
Miss E. Fortescue Brickdale. The poems included 
under the title " Men and Women " are not limited 
to the final grouping of the author, but include the 
much larger selection issued under that title in 
1855. " In a Balcony," however, has been omitted, 
because it was republished in a separate form by the 
author. The pictures, if we mistake not, appeared 
originally in an octavo edition of these poems, a 
few years ago. The volume contains a wealth of 
poetry, and is issued in an artistic and durable form, 
suited to the book-shelf or the pocket. (Hough ton 
Mifflin Co.). 

The continued popularity of Eugene Sue's 
" Mysteries of Paris " is attested by the handsome 
two-volume edition issued this Fall by Messrs. 
Crowell & Co. It is a reprint from the original 
English version published by Chapman and Hall, 
and seems to have the original illustrations nine 
spirited drawings in each volume. Together with 
" The Wandering Jew " and Victor Hugo's " Les 
Mise'rables," this story will long be read by lovers 
of old-fashioned French romance in its elaborate and 
somewhat sensational form. That the author was 
strongly convinced of the high moral purpose actu- 
ating his literary labors, appears in an interesting 
foot-note to the eighteenth chapter. 

Bret Harte's characteristic story of "Salomy 
Jane " is issued in a tastefully illustrated and decor- 
ated edition by the regular publishers of Bret Harte's 
works, Houghton Mifflin Co. Mr. Harrison Fisher 
and Mr. Arthur I. Keller have illustrated the tale 
most attractively, especially captivating being the 
former's conception of the heroine. Among the 
season's moderate-priced gift-books this has both in 
matter and embellishment rather unusual distinction.

[Dec. 1, 



MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 

That enthusiastic Bostonian, Miss Mary Caroline 
Crawford, follows up her "Old Boston Days and 
Ways " with another glowing tribute to the undying 
.hai m of the American Athens. In her " Roman* 
tie Days in Old Boston " (Little, Brown, & Co.) it is 
the nineteenth century that she chiefly confines her- 
self to in recalling the interests and activities of a 
Boston that, though irrevocably past, will endur- 
ingly survive in literature and tradition and in the 
permanent influence for good that she exerted on 
the country at large. Merely to name some of the 
topics selected for treatment by this well-informed 
writer such topics as the Brook Farm experi- 
ment, the real Zenobia, the slave as a hero, the 
words and deeds of Wendell Phillips and Theodore 
Parker, the old Boston theatres and their stars, old- 
time hostelries, the great fire, some famous visitors 
and how they were entertained, and Boston as a 
literary centre will give a notion of the book's 
strong appeal to readers -of the right sort." 
Though of the present generation, Miss Crawford 
has friendships and memories (her own or trans- 
mitted to her) that enable her to write with more 
than a scholar's command of her theme. The un- 
usually numerous and interesting illustrations in the 
book constitute one of its chief attractions. It is 
indexed, and runs to four hundred pages of most 
inviting reading matter. 

Steering a middle course between the seriousness 
of history and the frivolity of fiction, Mrs. Jean 
Lang's substantial volume entitled "A Land of 
Romance: The Border, its History and Legend" 
(Dodge Pub'g Co.) brings together a large amount 
of matter interesting to readers of Sir Walter, as 
also to students of Scotland's antiquities and the 
vicissitudes of her eventful history. Beginning with 
the building of the Roman Wall, the author passes 
on to the coming of Arthur, then to the spread of 
Christianity northward to that wild borderland, and 
after that treats of the border wizards. Monks and 
monsteries, the struggle for independence in the 
days of Wallace and Bruce, raiders and robbers, the 
ill-fated Mary Queen of Scots, border feuds, the 
Covenanters, bonnie Prince Charlie, and finally a 
chapter on "Sir Walter's Day," referring to the good 
old time when the Laird of Abbotsford was alive, 
such are, in brief, the remaining contents of the 
book, which is adorned with six photogravure illus- 
trations from paintings by Mr. Tom Scott An ap- 
propriate poem in six stanzas, by Mr. Andrew Lang, 
precedes the first chapter and prompts the inference 
that ' Jean Lang " is none other than Mrs. Andrew 
Lang. Not to be dismissed without commendation 
is the handsome typography of the book. 

A new series (the third) of " Where Ghosts 
Walk," by Mrs. Terhune ("Marion Harland") con- 
tinues those pleasant sketches of bygone folk of 
bygone days, as recalled by visits to their familiar 
haunts. The " Ghosts " of the new volume are 
English, with a sprinkling of French dames and 



gallants for variety. The visits paid to storied spot* 
are casual tourist's wanderings, Imt inspired by a 
definite purpose and backed by thorough prepara- 
tion. One of the most entertaining (sketches is that 
about the Ladies of Llangollen, the eccentric pair of 
eighteenth-century friends who forsook the gay 
world to live together in the wilds of North Wales. 
The mansion that they made out of a cottage is now 
stored with interesting relics of their tenantry, in- 
cluding journals, correspondence, and expense-books, 
whose items, quoted at length in the narrative, are 
both entertaining and enlightening. Two portraits, 
a photograph of their faithful maid, views of their 
house and of their tombs in the parish church-yard 
serve as illustrations to this chapter. The little 
Duke of Gloucester at Twickenham, Sir Philip 
Sidney at Penshurst, George Herbert at Bemerton, 
Joan of Arc at Chinon, and Marie Stuart at Am- 
boise are among the other subjects, in the treatment 
of which historical anecdote is pleasantly mingled 
with lively personal recollections of the scenes in 
which the dramas of great lives were set (G. P. 
Putnam's Sons.) 

It would be difficult to write a dull book about 
Rosa Bonheur. Virile, energetic, original to the 
verge of eccentricity, generous to a fault, absorbed 
in her art and holding a unique position among 
artists, withal a delightful and copious letter- 
writter, she provides an almost ideal subject 
for biographical study. Mr. Theodore Stanton's 
"Reminiscences of Rosa Bonheur" (Appleton) is, 
as far as possible, a first-hand record of the artist * 
personality as shown in her letters, and of her 
friends' and contemporaries' impressions, in many 
cases offered expressly for Mr. Stanton's use. Mr. 
Stanton furnishes the missing links in the chain of 
continuous narrative, besides exercising much .skill 
in sifting and arranging his documentary material. 
Many portraits and a number of reproductions of 
Rosa Bonheur's paintings enhance both the human 
and the artistic interest of the volume, which runs. 
always entertainingly, to the proportions of a stout 
octavo. Mr. Stanton's picture is that of a very 
genial, very independent woman, with a keen zest 
for life, an intense interest in only one thing, and a 
serene carelessness of public opinion except where 
it touched her paintings. 

The Friendly Library" (Macmillan) is enriched 
this season by two inviting little books, beautifully 
printed and bound, and neatly boxed. One of them. 
"The Book of Friendship," is tastefully illustrated 
by Mr. Wladyslaw T. Benda and provided with an 
appropriate introduction by Dr. Samuel McChord 
Crothers. The selections, in both prose and verse, 
are wide-ranging, culled from novels, plays, poems, 
the Bible, juvenile fiction, and published correspond- 
ence, all conveniently divided into sections headed 
"Childhood Fi i. Midships." " Inarticulate Friend- 
ships. -In School and College Days," "Neigh- 
bors," and so on. The other volume, entitled The 
Second Post," is a companion or supplement to "The 
(Jentlest Art." and compiled by the same skilful

hand that of Mr. E. V. Lucas. Bits of informal 
letter-writing are selected from the immortal letter- 
writers, and a number from less famous sources are 
added. A few unpublished fragments, mostly anony- 
mous, are also included. The whole, besides being 
good reading, forms an excellent guide and model 
to the would-be graceful and witty and friendly 
letter-writer. 

An agreeable book for all lovers of George Eliot 
has been written by Mr. Charles S. Olcott. " George 
Eliot: Scenes and People in her Novels" (Crowell) 
treats of the circumstances attending the writing 
of her successive stories and novels, with appro- 
priate illustrations from photographs. The original 
scenes and characters utilized by her are once 
more brought to our notice, and occasional critical 
remarks are introduced, both original and quoted. 
The chapter on " Romola," that scholarly effort of 
painstaking historical and antiquarian research, runs 
to a length and to a warmth of commendation rather 
out of proportion to its merits as a work of fiction. 
In a chapter devoted to the quasi-matrimonial rela- 
tions between Marian Evans and Mr. Lewes, the 
writer says that the two " decided to live together as 
husband and wife, and to make the mere announce- 
ment of their determination suffice in lieu of the 
usual ceremony." What about that nuptial cere- 
mony on the continent, which, as we have been glad 
to learn on apparently good authority, was resorted 
to as the best available substitute for a regular 
English marriage ? The book closes with a readable 
chapter on "The Womanliness of George Eliot " 

Miss Helen Keller's unrhymed poem in irreg- 
ular metre, which first appeared in " The Century 
Magazine " under the title "The Song of the Stone 
Wall," is now issued in book form with eight 
pictures from photographs representing the author 
amid rural surroundings, the wall also appearing in 
most of the views. The rough irregularity and 
enduring strength of the old wall, rudely built of 
field stones, are to some extent typified by the un- 
conventional pattern of the poem, while the fresh- 
ness and vocal sweetness of the woods and meadows 
through which the wall runs breathe again in the 
thought and feeling of the verses. The dedication 
is to Edward Everett Hale ; " for he loved the old 
walls and the traditions that cling about them," 
and he was himself "the living embodiment of 
whatever was heroic in the founders of New En- 
gland." Decorative borders add a finishing touch 
to this handsome volume. (Century Co.) 

Mr. and Mrs. Robert Shackleton's " Adventures 
in Home-Making " (Lane) will delight and inspire 
all enterprising persons who either don't own homes 
or find those they do own hopelessly ugly. There 
is no use in living in a house you don't like, aver 
the Shackletons cheerfully, and then proceed to 
produce their evidence : photographs of the very 
ugly one they bought, and of the charming abode 
into which, with comparatively small expenditure 
of money but with plenty of time and thought, they 
transformed it. How to remove " ginger bread " 



decorations, alter partitions, let in windows, take 
out superfluous doors and stairs, snatch charming 
banisters, mantels, and cupboard doors from the 
wreck of half-demolished houses, and transform the 
doors into wall-paneling, how to be everlastingly on 
the watch for the right things, to picture in imagin- 
ation just what you want and then get it, even to a 
secret stairway, this is what the Shackletons did ; 
and they describe the process in all its practical 
details, even to the sordid one of dollars and cents. 
The " Adventures " extended to porches, barn, 
gardens, useful and ornamental, and lawns; so that 
a variety of interest is assured. There are pictures 
of all stages of the game of home-making, the 
fascinations of which, in spite of multitudinous 
detail, are never lost sight of. 

A vivacious, even a tempestuous great lady was 
" Bess of Hardwick," whose life is entertainingly 
chronicled by Mrs. Maud Stepney Rawson. Thrice 
married to a great title, lady-in-waiting to Queen 
Elizabeth, friend of Mary of Scotland, - to whom 
her last husband, the Earl of Shrewsbury, long acted 
as jailor, vain, romantic, passionately fond of power 
and exercising a great deal of it, Elizabeth Countess 
of Shrewsbury is an extremely picturesque figure. 
Among " her children, her friends, her buildings, 
her household gods, her intrigues, and her dazzling 
dreams," she moves, always dominating, often in- 
scrutable, generally thorny, but never uninteresting. 
Her copious correspondence is largely drawn upon 
to add personality and local color to the pages of 
Mrs. Rawson's volume. Numerous family portraits 
at once illustrate and embellish the text. (John 
Lane Co.) 

Of such value to photographers and to artists in 
general did Mr. Sadakichi Hartmann's chapters on 
" Landscape and Figure Composition " show them- 
selves to be on their appearance in " The Photo- 
graphic Times " that they are now collected and 
issued, with some revision and enlargement, in book 
form, together with the numerous illustrations origin- 
ally accompanying them. Occasional diagrams are 
used to make clearer the author's remarks on com- 
position, and the tone of his instruction and exposi- 
tion is throughout so little technical or otherwise 
difficult that a mere beginner or even a general 
reader without artistic pretensions can follow him 
with ease and pleasure, as also with profit. Both 
celebrated paintings and views from nature are used 
in illustration, and though often the scale is too 
small for the best effect, the author's purpose is 
fairly well served. One, two, and even three illus- 
trations appear on a page, usually with some read- 
ing matter ; but the page is of generous propor- 
tions. (Baker & Taylor Co.) 

Beginning with " Beowulf " and ending with 
" Here ward the Wake," Mr. M. I. Ebbutt has re- 
told many of the more important legends of ancient 
British heroism and adventure. " Hero-Myths and 
Legends of the British Race" (Crowell) is a sub- 
stantial volume, fully illustrated by Mr. J. H. F. 
Bacon, Mr. Byam Shaw, and others, and is likely

THE DIAL 



to appeal strongly to the lovers of folk-lore and of 
stirring tales of heroes and adventurers. Younger 
readers of fairy-tales will be a little daunted by the 
book's apparatus of introductory and explanatory 
matter, by the glossary and index, and by the metri- 
cal passages, sometimes not inconsiderable, from 
both earlier and later sources. Yet older readers 
will profit by these helps to the understanding of 
the myths and legends, and younger readers will 
grow to their appreciation. The book covers well 
a certain age of fable with which every English- 
speaking person should be familiar. 

Local color, a dash of dialect here and there, 
swinging metres, .and spirited illustrations, many of 
them in the hues of nature, or an approximation 
thereto all this and more is to be set to the credit 
of the volume containing Mr. Joseph Mills Hanson's 
"Frontier Ballads" (McClurg). The twenty-five 
poems in the book are about evenly divided into 
>oldier Songs," "Prairie Songs," and "River 
Songs," of which the last two sections please us 
more than do the tales of violence and bloodshed. 
In "The Engineer of the 'Golden Hind' " we make 
the acquaintance of a second Jim Bludsoe who 
heroically runs his blazing craft ashore, and then 
has done with engines for good and evermore ; and 
in " Jesus Garcia," a similar character in the person 
of a Mexican railway engineer thrills the spell- 
bound reader. Mr. Maynard Dixon has furnished 
the drawings, which begin on the front cover of the 
book and run through the volume in a manner both 
realistic and decorative. 

The holiday season would scarcely be complete 
without Mr. Ralph Henry Bar hour's annual tale of 
young love and happiness. " The Golden Heart " 
(Lippincott) is the title of his latest offering. The 
heroine's eyes are of a sparkling blue, the hero's of 
a soulful brown ; she keeps a tea-room and gift-shop, 
he rows a skiff and paints pictures ; and as the tea- 
gift establishment stands at the water's edge, what 
more natural than a meeting and love at first sight? 
After that nature is allowed to take her course. But, 
incidentally, the author, in personifying Nature, 
makes her masculine, against which one must pro- 
test. The colored illustrations by Mr. Clarence F. 
Underwood are very pretty, and they catch the 
spirit of the little romance, while the marginal 
sketches and other decorations by Mr. Edward 
Stratton Holloway lend an attractive touch to this 
attractive book. 

Fire and passion, tears and pathos, the hunger 
for affection and the sweetness of reciprocated love 
are mingled in due proportion in the fascinating 
Japanese tale entitled " Tama " (Harper) by Onoto 
Watanna, author of " The Wooing of Wistaria," 
"The Heart of Hyacinth," and other successful 
stories. Tama the Fox-woman is the offspring of 
a surreptitious love affair between a foreign sailor 
and a " Noble Nun of second rank," and she be- 
comes enamoured of 0-Tojin-san (Honorable Mi. 
Foreigner) who is a professor in the college at 
Fukui, and who shown himself to be by no means a 



marble-hearted man. Interesting results follow. 
Four dainty colored illustrations, with softly-tinted 
marginal decorations, and cherry blossoms on the 
cover, give the book a very inviting aspect 

A fresh collection tf Mr. Harrison KMu-r'x 
studies in feminine beauty is issued by Messrs. 
Dodd, Mead & Co. in a volume entitled " A Garden 
of Girls." Its spacious pages are marginally deco- 
rated by Mr. Theodore B. Hapgood, and tint her 
filled with appropriate verses of an amorous nature. 
mostly from early and later English poets. A crit- 
ical eye cannot fail to note the mutilation and altera- 
tion of Donne's little poem, " The Message," which 
is blunderingly ascribed to - John Bonne." Certain 
of the girls have their charms not exactly heightened 
by the hideous headgear of the day, but other" IM 
the costumes are only less fetching than the bright 
eyes and rosy cheeks of their wearers. 

A good old-fashioned love-story in verse is pre- 
sented in " A Hoosier Romance" (Century Co.), by 
Mr. James Whitcomb Riley, with colored and other 
illustrations from the skilful hand of Mr. John 
Wolcott Adams, and with a tinted decorative design 
embellishing each page of print. The troubled but 
finally triumphant course of a true love, against 
which a harsh and miserly father makes unsuccess- 
ful opposition, is related in Mr. Riley's well-known 
manner, the climax of the tale being an ingenious 
variation of the elopement episode and the speedy 
tying of the nuptial knot. The book is tastefully 
bound and boxed. 

Three hundred and thirty-seven thousand copies 
of Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin's ' Rebecca of Sunny- 
j brook Farm " (Houghton) have been sold since its 
I first publication seven years ago. This \ve It-am 
from the " Publisher's Note " to the new illustrated 
holiday edition of the charming story. A colon- 1 
frontispiece by Mr. F. C. Yohn shows Rebecca 
seated by Mr. Cobb's side on the old stage-coach, 
and there are eight other illustrations from photo- 
graphs of scenes in the play so successfully made 
out of the story. The stage Rebecca contrasts 
strongly with the stage-coach Rebecca, and in other 
respects the theatre pictures are not quite what 
might best have interpreted the simple tale ; but the 
book is sure to please as a handsome holiday issue 
of a deservedly popular work. 

Folk-lore as it is found among tin vanishing 
aborigines of the far Northwest is presented in 
Miss Katharine Berry Judson's " Myths and Leg- 
ends of the Pacific Northwest, especially of Wash- 
ington and Oregon" (McClurg). Effort is made to 
relate the simple legends as the Indians tin ins. l\t ^ 
told them, though of course not in their tongue; and 
of course this means the reproduction of much that 
is childish and primitive in thought ami expression 
but all anthropologically significant even though 
devoid of literary charm. Of unusual beauty are 
the full-page views of natural scenery, and also 
interesting are the photographs of Indians and of 
their wares. The large form of the Look cond-i'miteS 
to the effectiveness of these numerous illustrations.

A handsome volume of " Stories of the Spanish 
Artists until Goya" (that is, including Goya), by 
Sir William Stirling-Maxwell, "selected and ar- 
ranged by Luis Carreno, with introduction by 
Edward Hutton," is published in this country by 
Messrs. Duffield & Co. Fifteen great artists of 
Spain, beginning with Morales in the sixteenth 
century and ending, not with Goya, but with Cean 
Bermudez, who survived Goya by a year, are chosen 
for biographical and anecdotal and more or less 
critical treatment, from contemporary records, with 
a sufficient reproduction, sometimes in color, of 
examples of their work. The book is of handsome 
appearance and sure to please the art-lover and the 
student of art-history. It is published in the " Art 
and Letters Library," forming a companion volume 
to those already devoted to Italian, Flemish, Dutch, 
English, and French artists, respectively. 

Selections in prose and verse (chiefly the latter) 
on the subject of friendship have been brought to- 
gether by Miss Ina Russelle Warren to form "A 
Book of Friendship " (Jacobs), which is published 
in a style befitting the theme. A frontispiece and 
marginal decorations give an artistic finish to the 
book, whose broad pages are graced with the praises 
of that " golden thread that ties the hearts of all 
the world " from the pens of various writers, from 
Marcus Tullius Cicero to Mr. George Sylvester 
Viereck. An author-index and a title-index facili- 
tate the finding of any given selection. 

An especially appropriate souvenir of the holiday 
season has been prepared by Mr. Walter Tittle. 
"Colonial Holidays: being a Collection of Contem- 
porary Accounts of Holiday Celebrations in Colonial 
Times" (Doubleday) is so elaborately illustrated 
and illuminated by the compiler that the reading 
matter, except such part of it as is ornamentally en- 
grossed on a gilded background, is quite cast in the 
shade. Divers passages from old chronicles and 
letters and diaries have been studiously hunted up 
and brought together so as to furnish, together with 
the pictures, some adequate conception of how our 
ancestors, whether Puritans or Cavaliers, celebrated 
the festive season. Nor is it Christmas and New 
Year's alone that are treated by the compiler ; 
Thanksgiving Day, May Day, royal birthdays, and 
other glad occasions receive due attention. 

Mr. E. S. Rait has felt moved by the studies he 
undertook for the " Victorian History of the Coun- 
ties of England " to edit a much smaller work on 
"English Episcopal Palaces (Province of Canter- 
bury)," which is issued in this country by Messrs. 
James Pott & Co. A staff of six contributing 
writers has prepared short historical and descriptive 
sketches of the archiepiscopal and episcopal palaces 
within the province of Canterbury, embellished with 
fourteen portraits, and with a frontispiece portrait 
of Sir Thomas More; but not a single one of the 
palaces is pictorially represented, except in the 
cover-design. The book, however, will please those 
interested in English church history. 



THE SEASON'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG. 



The following is a list of all children's books published 
during the present season and received at the office of 
THE DIAL up to the time of going to press with this

is believed that this list will commend itself to Holiday 
purchasers as a convenient and trustworthy guide to 
the juvenile books for the season of 1910.

NOTES. 



" The World of Dreams," a new book by Mr. Have- 
lock Ellis, which the Houghton Mifflin Co. bad hoped 
to publish this Autumn, will not be ready until next 
Spring. 

Mr. Austin Dobson's new volume of essays, entitled 
Old Kensington Palace, and Other Studies," will be 
issued at once in an American edition by the Frederick 
A. Stokes Co. 

A posthumous volume of essays by William Sharp, 
to be entitled " The Garden of Letters : Papers on Men 
and Movements," is being arranged for publication by 
Mrs. Sharp, and will appear shortly. 

" Julius Ciesar " and " Twelfth Night," both edited 
by N. Brainard Kellogg, and Carlyle's essay on Burns, 
edited by Dr. Julian W. Abernethy, are recent addi- 
tions to the "English Texts" of Messrs. Charles 6. 
Merrill & Co. 

" Literary Lapses " is the title of a volume of essays 
by Mr. Stephen Leacock, which the John Lane Co. will 
publish immediately. The same firm will also issue an 
extended biography of William Harrison Aiusworth, 
prepared by Mr. S. M. Ellis. 

The Wessels & Bissell Co. publish a new edition of 
Mr. Rossiter Johnson's " History of the War of Seces- 
sion, 1861-1865." No changes of consequence seem to 
have been made from previous issues of this very read- 
able and workmanlike history. 

Those who have never known the delight of reading 
Lord Dufferin's " Letters from High Latitudes " are 
earnestly counselled by us to procure the pretty new 
edition of the work now edited by Dr. R. W. Macan, 
and published by Mr. Henry Frowde as an especially 
acceptable volume of the " World's Classics." 

Mr. Walter Raleigh is a writer whose books are 
always welcome. His latest volume is a dignified tome 
published by Mr. Henry Frowde, and entitled "Six 
Essays on Johnson." Two of the six are now printed 



for the first time; the other four have previously seen 
the light in different quarters. One of the titles is 
"Johnson wit limit Boswell," a thing difficult to imagine, 
but justified by the essay itself. 

Volume X. of the " Proceedings of the Aristotelian 
Society " comes to us from Messrs. Williams & Norgate. 
There are ten papers in all, dealing for the most part 
with general and highly abstract themes, although two 
philosophers Kant and M. Bergson come in for 
specific attention. 

A new anthology, " The Englishman in Greece," is 
announced by the Oxford University Press. It has been 
compiled by Mr. H. S. Mil ford, and among the poets 
whose work is given are several living authors. Sir 
Rennell Rodd, one of these poets, contributes an intro- 
duction. The book is a companion volume to "The 
Englishman in Italy." 

Mr. Arthur Spurgeon's now familiar utterance on 
" The Premature Cheapening of Copyright Books " - 
being one of the most important papers read at the 
International Publishers' Congress which met at Am- 
sterdam last Summer is reprinted in handy pamphlet 
form, together with the English " Publisher's Cin u- 
lar's " comment thereon, by Messrs. Cassell & Co. 

English Tragicomedy : Its Origin and History," by 
Dr. Frank Humphrey Ristine, is a publication of the 
Columbia University Press, done in the regulation aca- 
demic fashion, with notes and bibliographies. A Har- 
vard production of the same well-defined type is Dr. 
William Alfred Morris's monograph on " The Frank- 
pledge System," published by Messrs. Longmans, Green, 
& Co. 

Paul Johann Ludwig Heyse, the veteran poet and 
novelist who has just been awarded the Nobel Prize in 
Literature, is probably best known to the American 
public through his play " Mary of Magdala," which Mr. 
William Winter translated and Mrs. Fiske produced 
some years ago, and his novel " Children of the World " 
which in its English translation has gone through several 
editions. 

Six volumes have recently been added to Messrs. 
Scribners* " Memorial Edition" of George M-iv<lith's 
works: "The Tragic Comedians," "Diana of the Cross- 
ways," " One of our Conquerors," " Lord Ormont and 
his Aminta," " The Amazing Marriage," and " Celt 
and Saxon." This instalment completes the tale of the 
novels, leaving only the short stones, essays, and poems 
to complete the edition, besides a volume of bibliogra- 
phical material. 

"The Vineyard" is the title of a little monthly 
magazine recently started in London which sets for 
itself the ambitious task of cultivating "every thing that 
has proved essential in the real progress of man." Its 
more specific purpose is to fortify the ancient love of 
the earth, alike for its spiritual and economic value." 
In this wholly commendable aim we wish " The Vine- 
yard " all success. Its contents are pleasingly varied 
and interesting, and its physical make-up inviting. Mr. 
A. C. Fifield is the publisher. 

An authorized biography of the late Julia Ward 
Howe is in preparation by her daughters, Mrs. Laura 
E. Richards and Mrs. Maud Howe Klliott. and will be 
published next year by the Houghton Mifllin Co. In 
order that nothing may be lost from the record of Mi-. 
Howe's activities of many years, the authors request the 
loan of letters and characteristic notes that may be use- 
ful for the purposes of the biography. Communications 



1910.]

may be addressed to Mrs. Laura E. Richards, Gardiner, 
Maine. All material sent will be promptly copied and 
returned to the owners. The authors will also be grate- 
ful for any personal anecdotes or reminiscences of Mrs. 
Howe. Early this month the Houghton Mifflin Co. 
are planning to publish a collection of Mrs. Howe's 
later poems entitled " At Sunset," upon which she was 
engaged at the time of her death. They were written 
mostly during the last eleven years, many of them for 
notable public occasions. 

" The Cost of Our National Government," very appro- 
priately sub-entitled " A Study in Political Pathology," 
is a volume by Professor Henry Jones Ford, now pub- 
lished by the Columbia University Press. It contains 
the George Blumenthal lectures for 1909, revised and 
amplified for presentation to the reading public. The 
recognition and diagnosis of a pathological condition 
must necessarily precede curative measures, and the case 
now under discussion is sorely desperate, but we have 
no great hopes that the heroic remedies needed will ever 
be applied. 

A volume of seven " Essays and Studies by Members 
of the English Association," collected by Mr. A. C. 
Bradley, is published by Mr. Henry Frowde. Mr. 
Henry Bradley leads off with a study of " English 
Place-Names," and Mr. Robert Bridges follows with a 
paper " On the Present State of English Pronunciation," 
which (the state) we violate no confidence in saying that 
the writer finds discouraging. The five remaining 
essays are upon subjects as varied as Blond Harry, 
Shakespeare, Browning, and Carlyle, with a pleasant 
essay by Mrs. Edith Sichel entitled " Some Suggestions 
about Bad Poetry." Altogether, the collection makes 
very good reading. 

Mr. Cobden-Sanderson announces the early publica- 
tion of three new volumes from The Doves Press, com- 
prising: Browning's " Dramatis Persona?," printed 
from the first (1864) edition; " Pervigilium Veneris," 
edited, rearranged, and supplemented by Professor J. W. 
Mackail; and " Laudes Creaturarum," by St. Francis 
of Assisi, in the Latin text with Matthew Arnold's trans- 
lation. During the coming year Mr. Cobden-Sanderson 
hopes to issue the following: Goethe's " Die Leiden des 
Jungen Werther," from the Weimar text; "In Prin- 
cipio," the first chapter of Genesis in the Authorised 
Version ; " A Decade of Years," poems by Wordsworth, 
1798-1808; and Shakespeare's "Anthonie and Cleo- 
patra," in the First Folio text. 

A posthumous work of Lafcadio Hearn's, being a 
translation of Flaubert's "The Temptation of St. 
Anthony," is published by the Alice Harriinau Com- 
pany of New York and Seattle. An illuminating preface 
by Hearn's biographer, Mrs. Elizabeth Bisland Wetmore, 
gives interesting personal reminiscences of the making 
of the translation, which belongs to the early period of 
" Cleopatra's Night " and newspaper work in Cincinnati 
and San Francisco. Mrs. Wetmore dilates also upon 
the spiritual fitness of Hearn for interpreting what is 
considered by many to be Flaubert's masterpiece ; and 
she adds something about Flaubert and the tremendous, 
passionate effort that went into everything he wrote. 
Hearn preceded the translation by a brief " Argument "; 
in both is to be found the subtle, sensitive, exquisite 
quality of style which marks all his work. The trans- 
lation is complete save for a few unessential paragraphs, 
which Hearn intended to treat as addenda, and which 
the publishers have thought better to omit entirely.

REASON AND BELIEF 

By SIR OLIVER LODGE 

8vo. $1.25 net; by mail, $1.37. 

" He approaches the subject from a scientific viewpoint, reverently, reasonably, and with a lucidity of expression that 
is distinctly helpful to the ordinary intelligent man." London Daily Graphic. 

"The work, like everything the author writes, is a contribution of value, and peculiarly interesting because of the 
characteristically personal note it strikes." Scotsman, 

EXTRACT FROM THE PREFACE. Ever since the close of the nineteenth century a difficulty has been felt about the utili- 
zation of the Old Testament for teaching children. Nor has conviction of the truth of the cardinal doctrines of the New 
Testament been quite unshaken. So much has had to be modified or discarded, in deference to scientific discoveries which 
are in process of popular assimilation, that a hesitating cautious attitude is not only reasonable but meritorious. 

In so far, however, as my own researches have led me to perceive a profound substratum of truth underlying ancient 
doctrines, and in so far as the purpose of them instead of underlying actually illustrates and illumines use of these, I con- 
ceive it to be my duty as well as my privilege to indicate to the best of my ability how matters stand.

The New York Sun says in an editorial : " It is a pleasure to The Sun to note in this part of the paper the'publication of 
an unpretentious but very meritorious text book of political philosophy by the Hon. JOB E. HEDGES. It is called " Common 
Sense in Politics." and the title is warranted by the character of Mr. HEDGES'S cogitations. The author has thought 
seriously, soberly, and honestly about many of the aspects of contemporary political life in America, and has written his 
ideas in a style that is a lesson in good English. We commend the book to our fellow-citizens, to be read if possible before 
the approaching elections, or, if there is not time for that, to be studied considerately during the subsequent leisure." 

"A FLAMING NOVEL" 

FREEBOOTERS OF THE WILDERNESS 

By AGNES C. LAUT 

12mo. $1.35 net; by mail, $147. 

A spirited, powerful novel of the Northwest of America as it is to-day. The scene is high up in the 
big lumber country, with the Rangers, the sheep-men, the missionaries, the outlaws, and the others who give 
the land its character. The issue is one of those which gives the cause of conservation its piquancy to-day, 
an issue resulting from corporate greed worked out through politics and lawlessness and its resistance by 
the conservators of the people's interests, the sage green rangers. 

There is a love story of the utmost interest, and the incidents which cluster around the plot's develop- 
ment are many of them of the most exciting sort

A most tender little story, in which the author, with the

THE MOST AMAZING HUMAN DOCUMENT OF RECENT YEARS 

China Under the Empress Dowager 

Being the History of the Life and Times of Tzu Hsi 

Compiled from State Papers and the Private Diary of the Comptroller of Her Household 

By J. O. P. BLAND and E. BACKHOUSE 

For the first time this remarkable volume lifts the veil that diplomacy allowed to fall 
over the late Empress Dowager's share in the Boxer outbreak during the summer of 
1910. It begins with an introductory history of the Yehonala family, and graphically 
covers the stirring incidents and happenings during Tzu Hsi's eventful reign from her 
first regency to her death. It also incorporates the diary of His Excellency Ching 
Shan, which is more illuminating than perhaps any document that has ever come out 
of China. In it is recorded what actually took place from day to day in the Forbid- 
den City during the siege of the Legations, and what was the manner and cause of 
many strange incidents during that period of stress and storm.

THE AMERICAN ACADEMY. 



It was a year ago that the American Acad- 
emy of Arts and Letters made its formal 
appearance before the public. The place was 
Washington, and, besides the regular sessions 
of the organization, there was a reception by 
the President of the United States, which in a 
way symbolized the newly-assumed public char- 
acter of the organization. Application was made 
to Congress for a national charter, and the 
bill for that purpose is still pending. It passed 
the Senate, but did not obtain from the House 
the " unanimous consent " necessary for prompt 
action. Some members objected because their 
own pet measures could not gain this concession, 
and one or two others because they could not 
discover in the membership of the Academy any 
representatives of, say, Arkansas or Oklahoma. 
We trust that this was only a temporary post- 
ponement of action upon a subject that cannot 
possibly be affected by any political interest, 
and is of some concern to the higher life of the 
nation. 

Last week, the second public meeting of the 
Academy was held, this time in New York, and 
in connection with the larger National Institute 
of Arts and Letters, from whose membership 
academicians must be elected. The sessions 
were dignified and impressive, fully justifying, 
if that were necessary, the existence of the two 
organizations which jointly represent the best 
that America can offer in literature and scholar- 
ship, in music and the arts of design. Even 
the newspapers were somewhat less irreverent

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



than they usually are in dealing with anything 
that even remotely suggests Matthew Arnold's 
saving "remnant," did not make as many 
jocose remarks about " immortals " as might 
have been expected, and in general treated the 
meeting quite seriously. Those who were pres- 
ent felt that they were witnessing the begin- 
nings of a movement having much potentiality 
for good, and likely in the future to play a 
considerable part in our national life. 

A year ago, we published a list of the members 
of the Academy as it then was constituted. 
There have been a few deaths and a few elections 
since that time, but the list remains substanti- 
ally the same. One of the sessions of last week 
was devoted to the reading of commemorative 
papers upon the members who have died during 
the last five years or so, and the roll is one of 
which any body and any country might well be 
proud. In literature, the names included were 
those of Stedman, Clemens, Hay, Norton, 
Aldrich, Jefferson, Gilder, Schurz, Harris, and 
Hale. In music and the fine arts there were the 
names of Mac Do well, Saint-Gaudens, McKim, 
Ward, and Homer. Since the plans for this 
session were made, three other academicians, 
Moody, La Farge, and Mrs. Howe (the only 
woman member) have gone over to the majority. 
It must be a lasting inspiration to the organi- 
zation to know that these men once adorned its 
ranks, as well as a spur to those living to make 
themselves as worthy as possible to occupy the 
vacated places. 

The sessions pf last week were held in the 
New Theatre (generously given for the occasion) 
and were gracefully presided over by Mr. 
William Dean Howells, as President of the 
Academy, and Mr. Henry Van Dyke, as Pres- 
ident of the Institute. The papers which were 
read were upon a high level of thought, and 
struck with proper discretion, but without undue 
forcing, the American note. The last-mentioned 
characteristic was noticeable in the afternoon 
session of December 8, when music, poetry, 
fiction, and sculpture were respectively repre- 
sented by Messrs. Walter Damrosch, Percy 
Mackaye, Hamlin Garland, and Lorado Taft. 
The morning session had been occupied with 
more abstract and philosophical themes, 
" Criticism," by Mr. William Crary Brownell, 
"The Revolt of the Unfit," by President 
Nicholas Murray Butler, and "The Living 
Past in the Living Present," by Mr. Henry 
Mills Alden. All these papers will appear in 
due time in the Proceedings of the organiza- 
tions concerned. 



The first paper of all must have a word to 
itself. It was entitled "A Retrospection," and 
was read by the venerable John Bigelow. The 
paper itself was a page of racy reminiM .-n. . 
from the author's life in Paris in the early 
sixties, but the interest it aroused on its own 
account was greatly exceeded by interest in tin 
personality of the reader. That wonderful old 
man, now in his ninety-fourth year, brought the 
whole audience to its feet when he stepped for- 
ward upon the platform, and the prolonged 
applause which his appearance evoked was 
heart-felt and sincere. His voice was low but 
distinct, and he spoke with a degree of anima- 
tion suggestive of anything but senility. In 
him, the Academy boasts of a member who 
comes close to being an "immortal" in the 
literal sense, and he gave a new turn to an 
ancient jest when he began his remarks by 
saying : " You'd scarce expect one of my age 
to stand in public on a stage." 

Second in interest only to Mr. Bigelow's 
contribution to the programme was the Shake- 
spearian reading given by Dr. Horace Howard 
Furness, that veteran scholar who bears his 
years so lightly, and wears his honors with such 
unaffected simplicity. "King Henry the Fifth" 
was the play chosen for the reading, and those 
who knew the play best felt that they were 
viewing it in a new light through the medium 
of the reader's skilfully modulated voice and 
occasional suggestive commentary. Not the 
least noteworthy incident of the meeting was 
the bestowal of the gold medal of the Institute 
upon Mr. James Ford Rhodes, declared by a 
plurality of votes to be the most worthy among 
living American historians to be awarded this 
distinction. The closing act of the public exer- 
cises was provided by a formal reception given 
by the Mayor of New York in the Lenox Li- 
brary. When the end of the entire programme 
was reached, the members regretfully dispersed, 
most of them feeling, we think, that it was good 
to have been participants in the affair. It was 
all very skilfully managed, and its temper was 
happily voiced by the President of the Academy 
when he said : 

"The academies of France, Spain, St. Petersburg, 
and other European countries have un aiitiioritati\i* 
position which we don't pretend to. We don't hope to 
shape American art and letters, hut our aggregation 
will make for a higher standard in American art and 
letters. Each of us feels the molecular stir of universal 
activity. The purpose of our organization is to relate 
itself to the testhetic life of tin* nation. \\ < lia\r a ri^lit 
to remain in this organization because we hope that we 
can help others to do something more important than 
we have done ourselves."

ANATOLE FRANCE. 



Did some prevision of worthiness stir within 
Jacques Anatole Thibault when he chose for pseu- 
donym the name of his country and became Anatole 
France ? If so, time has justified his temerity ; for 
now, at sixty-six years of age, the author of some 
twenty-seven works, and member of the Academy, 
he is certainly the most interesting and perhaps the 
most remarkable figure in the literary life of con- 
temporary France. Furthermore, his fame and his 
books have begun the crossing of boundary lines, 
translations are growing abundant, and one sees 
"Anatole France" in the lite'rary journals almost 
as often as the names of the popular novelists. 

When a foreigner comes to America, we have an 
unfortunate habit of saddling him with a compari- 
son : he is the Hearst of Italy, or the Roosevelt of 
Illyria, or the boss of Madrid. A foreign author 
must be labelled forthwith; hence many an un- 
offending Belgian or Russian has Shakespeare or 
Mark Twain stamped upon him for the American 
market. No one denies the usefulness of the prac- 
tice, but in certain cases it may be unfortunate. We 
have greeted Anatole France as the Sterne of his 
native country. The comparison is particularly un- 
happy. Sterne was a sentimentalist : France is as 
unsentimental as Bernard Shaw. Sterne played upon 
the foibles of human nature : France attacks human 
nature itself. There seems to be no possible resem- 
blance between the two writers unless in their like 
mastery of wit and of style, a resemblance which 
scarcely justifies an exchange of names. If France 
must be compared to an Englishman, let it be to 
Swift. Swift turned his generation into pigmies, 
and so made fun of them ; he made his ideas of 
better men into giants, and so cudgelled his contem- 
poraries with Brobdingnagian strokes ; he embodied 
his ideals in the form of a horse, and so cast scorn 
upon the unideal. Just so Anatole France trans- 
forms his Frenchmen into penguins that he may ex- 
pose their frailties, saints into fools that he may 
reflect upon saintly wisdom, and beloved stories into 
analyses of human folly. By all means call him the 
Swift of France, if you must compare ; but the truth 
is more interesting than any approximation. 

After the comparison-mongers, two other recep- 
tion committees have waited upon the reputation of 
Anatole France. They are the slightly contemptu- 
ous and the entirely objective schools of criticism. 
The first make no bones of the matter. France 
lashes the church, lashes the state, lashes morality, 
lashes human nature. Believing in nothing himself, 
he is as destructive as a steam-shovel. Therefore he 
is a satirist without a standard, an intellectual dilet- 
tante, and thus very dangerous. The objective 
school is more gentle. For them, France is a wit, 
a stylist, and a consummate master of irony. His 
fundamental beliefs or disbeliefs can go hang. What 
do they care about his dilettanteism so long as he 
amuses them ! Both schools, I believe, are wrong. 



The accusers on the grounds of dilettanteism 
were nourished, one may suppose, upon " Le Crime 
de Sylvestre Bonnard," and have cherished opinions, 
thus conceived, to apply them where they do not be- 
long. " Sylvestre Bonnard " is an old book. It was 
crowned by the French Academy in 1881, and has 
been popular ever since, as witness my own copy, 
bought in August, 1909, in France and of the one 
hundredth and ninth edition. When you read it, a 
strange sense of familiarity comes over you, mingled 
with a stranger sense of novelty. The familiarity is 
easily explained. The book is an idyll, a prose 
idyll of the kind the French have always done so 
well. Sylvestre Bonnard, the scholar, sits in his 
City of Books far above the Paris quays and looks 
down upon the world below. After awhile he ven- 
tures out into that world. First, it is when a young 
wife has the temerity to become a mother in the 
neighborhood of his scholarly retreat ; again, it is 
in a wild pursuit of a manuscript, to Sicily and back ; 
most decisively, however, when he joins battle with 
custom and law in an attempt to save from misery 
the daughter of a woman he had once loved. With, 
as hero, the most charming and gracious scholar who 
ever lost the world for a book, this is sufficiently 
idyllic. 

But Sylvestre is somewhat different from the 
" professor " who usually represents the faculty in 
literature. True, he is unworldly, as that figure 
always is. True, he distrusts his imagination, and 
is aware of the cramping of his heart. But Bon- 
nard remains a hard-headed intellectual from cover 
to cover. He exhausts the thirteenth century, yet 
in the droop of his age one finds him, no truant to 
knowledge, at work upon the society of the flowers 
and the bees. In brief, this book is an idyll of the 
intellectual life, the most intractable of materials for 
idyllics ; and hence its curious novelty. It is made 
up of the reflections of the world upon the mirror of 
the intellect. If it has a moral, it teaches how to 
get pleasure from one's mental life, and thus is 
indubitably a study in intellectual dilettanteism. 

But I believe no one called France a dilettante 
when he published " Bonnard." With so gentle a 
book, there was no need for name-calling. And 
yet satire was latent there. Hamilcar, who purred 
upon his cushions in the City of Books, could some- 
times show his claws; and so could the author of 
" Sylvestre Bonnard." Old Bonnard got his wished- 
for manuscript through the woman with the baby; 
for she was a collector of rarities too of rare 
match-boxes with photographs of notabilities on the 
covers, and so of course could sympathize with

Indeed, though Bonnard passes with a Nunc Dim-

of it, quite willing now to test Paris and the world 
with his intellect, sure that if they be found wanting 
his intellect will still remain to console him. It is

THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



idyll, who wrote " L'lle des Pingouins," and lias 
been called an intellectual dilettante for doing so. 
"The hie of Penguins " was probably not the greatest 
book of its year (1908), but it was perhaps the 
most interesting, and certainly the most remarkable. 
It begins with a faithful if somewhat satiric repre- 
sentation of an early saint of the kind which those 
who read the saints' legends know. The blissful 
Mal had been accustomed, like all the early mis- 
sionaries, to navigate in a trough of stone; but, 
tempted by the devil, he foregoes the miracle and 
takes to a boat. The evil boat, taking the wind in 
its teeth, flies far down into the Antarctic, and there 
lands the blissful .Mad. weary, half blind with spray, 
upon a little island, where sit a colony of penguins. 
The holy man mistakes them for savages, blesses 
them, and, believing that the chorus of quackings 
with which they respond to his voice indicates a 
desire to be saved, instructs them in the faith, and 
baptizes each one with a drop of pure water upon 
his head. Then the pontiffs, the doctors, and the 
saints in Heaven are thrown into a horrid confusion. 
What has been the effect of this unfortunate bap- 
tism? Is it the form or the spirit of the sacrament 
which counts? If it is the form, here is a pretty 
pickle! The debate goes to the formalists; and 
God, to save an embarrassment for what if the 
Penguins, having no souls, should sin and be damned ? 
transforms the birds to men. Then the isle of 
the Penguins is towed by miracle to the Breton 
shores ; Penguiny becomes France, the rise of the 
Penguins the rise of our modern civilization. But 
the Penguins, though men in shape, at first are but 
animals in intelligence. It is an opportunity for 
their facile historian who, with searching irony and 
infinite wit, leads them through the courses of 
sophistication. One views in their bare nakedness 
the origin of sacred institutions. " Do you not see," 
cries the ancient Mael, " this furious Penguin who 
bites the nose of his fallen adversary, and that other 
who pounds the head of a woman with a great 
stone? " " I see them," answers Bulloch, his fellow 
monk. They create law ; they found property ; 
they establish the principles of civilization, the basis 
of society, and the foundation of the State." The 
age of myth appears, with its dragon, who is ex- 
posed as a most vicious fraud, but remembered by 
the Penguins as a most awful reality. And so one 
passes through the notable twists and turns of 
French history wherein man is shown to be always 
ridiculous, incapable, vain, and lewd ; where woman 
is sensual, and the cause of wickedness and wars ; 
where great events happen from little causes, and 
the Penguins as men are often more ignoble than 
as birds. Finally, the story looks to the future. 
" Houses could never be built high enough ; they 
raised them ceaselessly, constructing thirty or forty 
stories upon which were placed offices, stores, and 
banks ; while, beneath, the earth was dug more and 
more deeply for cellars and tunnels. Fifteen mil- 
lions of men worked in the giant city." But life 
had become too monotonous, too hard for happi- 



ness. A young man, who felt that this society had 
passed its usefulness, harnessed radium, and in a 
series of mighty explosions wrecked the giant city. 
Anarchy followed, and gave rise to decadence. The 
city died, and was buried beneath pastures. A 
pastoral people wandered over the site. They 
founded villages. The villages became great towns. 
These united into a vast capital. It grew rich and 
vast, until " houses could never be built high enough : 
they raised them ceaselessly, constructing thirty or 
forty stories upon which they placed offices, stores, 
and banks ; while, beneath, the earth was dug more 
and more deeply for cellars and tunnels. Fifteen 
millions of men worked in the giant city." And 
thus, with the recurrence of a melancholy cycle, 
the book ends. 

The school of the contemptuous and the school of 
the objectivists view this story in different fashions ; 
and to them is added a third school with still a 
third point of view. This last group is the most 
positive of all. The book is bad, they say, morally 
bad, and so wash their hands of further criticism. 
One must admit, in fact, that the English lady who 
found " Antony and Cleopatra " " so unlike the 
home-life of our dear queen " would be shocked by 
" The Isle of Penguins," seriously shocked. But it 
is doubtful whether she would not be more shocked 
still by Voltaire's " Candide." The two books be- 
long upon the same shelf. Who should read them 
and who should not, is a nice question, the answer 
to which I leave to divines. I wol not han to do 
with such matere." 

The contemptuous say that "The Isle of Pen- 
guins " is dangerous politically, because it advocates 
the destruction of a society which has failed in the 
pursuit of happiness and therefore advocates 
anarchy ; that it is dangerous for religion, since its 
attitude is completely negative as regards religion 
itself, but most positive in its abuse of the accom- 
paniments of the Christian religion ; that it is 
dangerous morally, since it adopts the anthropologi- 
cal explanation of our morals, and traces result^ 
which, if sometimes ludicrous, are terrible to con- 
template; and that, though pessimistic, it is com- 
pletely flippant in tone. They charge the author 
with attacking everything while believing in no- 
thing ; and maintain, finally, that the book as a 
whole is dangerous because it is irresponsible. 

The particular charges I admit ; the general. I 
deny. Anatole France does believe in something : 
he believes in intellectuality. The force of his 
attack upon humanity betrays some interest in th<> 
body attacked, even as Swift's brutal onslaught 
proved that he felt his enemies to be worth chastis- 
ing. One does not analyze the weaknesses of tin- 
French character for four hundred pages, with con- 
tempt of the species as the only motive. The writer 
must at least assume an intellect sufficiently intflli- 
gent to appreciate attacks upon itoelf, and worthy 
to be written for! An ingenuous youth atadinm-r 
given to France in the Argentine Republic de- 
clared that the writer had bestowed upon the young

THE DIAL

men of the republic a new conception of life. Surely 
the books this youth had read were positive as well 
as negative. And they are so, all of France's satiric 
books. They apply the test of intellectuality, or of 
the intellectual life, to the world, and then discourse 
of the reactions. The author has a standard of 
criticism and a basis for his satire. He is like his 
Colomban, who seems to stand for Zola in the 
Penguin's version of the Dreyfus case. Colomban, 
a short-sighted, hairy little man, alone of all the 
Penguins can apply reason to the affair of the 
alleged traitor. When he sees the truth, he acts 
upon it ; and in spite of abuse, bruises, slander, 
threats, advances the banner of reason against the 
hosts of unreason and prejudice. When he is over- 
whelmed with the execrations of the multitude, he 
is content to remark, " The affair is more difficult 
than I had supposed." Tumbled into the Seine, 
sheltering his dripping body beneath a bridge in com- 
pany with an old, lame horse, he merely persists, 
" This affair is more difficult than I had supposed." 
France is far more tactful than Colomban, but he 
displays the same consistency in advocating reason 
and the intellect. In this book he is in no sense 
a dilettante, and though often wrong or at least 
one devoutly hopes so is in no sense irresponsible. 

But no more tenable is the position of those who 
are content merely to enjoy the exquisite wit, the 
charming style of "The Isle of Penguins," while 
they let the sincerity of the author take care of 
itself. Bernard Shaw and Anatole France are fellow- 
sufferers in this respect. Their wit, their style, 
cannot be wholly appreciated when divorced from 
its guiding principle. France's principles, or his 
application of them, must often be erroneous ; other- 
wise it is a pretty world we live in. To ignore or 
deny them is to miss the full flavor of his work. 

Nevertheless, there is much that is racial in prin- 
ciples, and in the satire which flows from them. It 
may be that the purely literary and artistic virtues 
of the books of Anatole France are more instructive 
for English readers than his philosophy, be that 
never so cogent. His satire is sometimes like 
French tobacco, designed for home consumption ; 
whereas his literary art has earned its English 
rights since it has made singularly impressive a 
foreign mental attitude which is neither very novel 
nor particularly sympathetic. 

Some of the literary virtues of this Frenchman 
are perhaps the virtues of the French in general. 
His style is clarity and grace itself ; he has, what is 
so rare in English, a light pen for heavy matters ; 
he never fails to make precise the half-thought or 
the subtle perception. But there is one virtue, one 
power, which is all his own : the satirical illumina- 
tion of legend or history. He is not a good story- 
teller. He stops at too many pleasant cafe's where 
one may rest awhile and discuss the situation ; his 
characterization is too arbitrary. Yet he chooses 
story-telling for the discharge of his ideas, and so 
falls unfortunately sometimes, successfully often 
into a kind of narrative essay. In his best vein, he 



holds with the modern historian that the chronicles 
preserve only the symbols of the past ; then deduces 
from an old story the true happening. Every ap- 
pearance of scholarship bolsters his work. Sylvestre 
Bonnard himself might be proud of the erudition, of 
the method ; and yet the results are pure satire. One 
feels the ultra-modern intellect at work upon the 
foundations of tradition, and this satire cuts home. 

u Les Sept Femmes de Barbe-Bleue," which 
everyone in France seemed to be reading in the 
summer of 1909, is a charming example of this un- 
comfortably effective process. " The Seven Wives 
of Bluebeard," though it gives the book its title, is 
not the best story. There is, for example, the miracle 
of the great St. Nicholas. Scientific scholarship 
proves that there were two saints of this name. 
Scientific scholarship, after the best models, identi- 
fies one of them as the holy man of the nursery- 
rhyme who miraculously synthesized the bodies of 
three children salted in a pork barrel. Back to the 
city of Trinqueballe the bishop for this St. 
Nicholas was a bishop led the fruits of his ex- 
periment, and there brought them up according to 
a policy of perpetual kindness, hoping thus to 
counteract the harshness of their years in the pork- 
barrel. But note the results of the miracle : one 
became a murderer and ravisher, one a swindler, 
and one a heretic. Thanks to the efforts of the 
three, Nicholas was despoiled of his wealth, bereft of 
his beloved niece, his bishopric torn by wars and 
dissensions, its faith made prey to indecent heresies, 
and he himself driven out to seek some hermitage 
where he might spend the little remainder of his 
life in puzzling over the mystery of the will of God. 
Yet the purpose of the miracle was not left unex- 
plained. There was a hermit upon the lonely 
mountain-top where he sought for peace. It was 
the wicked inn-keeper who had salted the three 
unfortunates ! The miracle had converted him ; he 
was the soul saved by the universal wreck. 

Then there is "La Chemise," a perfect work of 
its kind, almost as perfect in form and this is rare 
with France as it is pungent in substance. A 
king, as in the old tale, must have a shirt from a 
perfectly happy man if he is to be cured of his ills ; 
but king and ills are modern. This ruler who 
bears a strange resemblance to Leopold, the late 
lamented of Belgium is a commercial success; he 
has learned to despise his ministers, and yet run a 
constitutional government without friction ; he has 
learned to steer his course between popularity and 
unpopularity ; but in spite of all the conveniences 
of a modern kingship, he is bored bored until 
ennui becomes a disease. His physician belongs to 
the modern school which believes in natural reme- 
dies. Sea-air, mineral waters, for example, are 
excellent ; and for this case, no less a tonic than the 
exudations from the skin of a perfectly happy man. 
Saint-Sylvan and Quatref euilles go forth to find the 
happy man and his shirt. They approach a noble 
peer ; alas, he loves the public, and the public revile 
him for his solicitude. They seek a heroic duke ;

he is senile, the prey of his servants. They din- 
cover, with rejoicings, a country curt who lives an 
idyllic life among his peasants ; his existence is a 
torture, for he no longer believes. The lover, the 
rich man, the wise, and a dozen of those intermediate 
types which modern society provides, are but new 
figures for the comedy. Women they do not seek. 
It will not do to feminize the king's ideas of happi- 
ness, and besides, says Saint-Sylvan, "I observe 
that, in our class, they do not bring up their chil- 
dren, do not direct their households, know nothing, 
do nothing, and kill themselves with fatigue ; they 
consume themselves in shining, their life is a kind 
of candle ; I ignore if it is enviable." And, last of 
all, Mousque, a poor half-witted creature who plays 
about in the king's park and makes toys for the 
children. " As happy as Mousque," the people say. 
He is happy, he admits it when they explain to 
him the nature of happiness; but when they offer 
him gold, a palace, a new pair of shoes, for his shirt, 
his face expresses only surprise. He had no shirt ! 
And it is thus that this good Anatole France 
teases his penguins. Is he a notable figure in con- 
temporary literature? Certainly he is an artist 
with novel means at his disposal ; certainly a power- 
ful satirist with a consistent standard of criticism. 
Yet, if notable, it is not because his point of view 
is new it was Voltaire's before him but because 
of the -kill and the modernity of its application. 
One is tempted to call him the Swift of France ; in 
spite of the dangers of comparison, one is still more 
tempted to call him the Voltaire of the twentieth 
century, though a very limited and specialized 
Voltaire, who advances, as the only guide, a very 
up-to-date intellect : indeed, a Voltaire so individual 
that it would be well to exhaust the resemblance, 
and drop it, before we begin to compare some 
writer of our own to Anatole France.

CASUAL COMMENT. 



THE KEPROACH OF ACADEMICISM, which that vig- 
orous and independent thinker, Thomas Davidson, 
the "wandering scholar"- (as his biographer, Dr. 
William Knight, aptly called him), used to throw 
up against the college-trained man, is still one that 
waits to be entirely removed. Undoubtedly the 
modern varied curriculum, despite its faults, pro- 
duces fewer prigs and pedants than did the old-time 
college course that demanded of the student little 
beyond an ability to read and remember, and that 
placed a premium on drudgery rather than on intel- 
lect A correspondent of the New York " Evening 
Post," Professor Hiram Bingham of Yale, offers a 
suggestion which, if universally followed, might go 
far toward removing the reproach of academicism, 
and toward making the mere drudge much less suc- 
cessful in his pursuit of academic honors. " The 
bane of our present college teaching," Mr. Bingham 



believes, " is the frequency of questions beginning 
with 'what' and 'who/ and the infrequency of 
those beginning with why ' and ' how.' Of course 
such questions are harder to make out, harder t<> 
answer, and harder to mark than those designed to 
see whether the student can give back what he has 
heard the instructor say, or has read in the text- 
book. But my own experience has been that the 
results are correspondingly far more satisfactory." 
This substitution of the " why " and " how " for 
the " what " and " who " would certainly discourage 
the cowardly though comforting habit of clinging to 
the text-book as to a life-preserver.

THE PUBLIC LIBRARY A PUBLIC PANACEA such, 

in brief, is the burden of the song, or hymn of 
praise, that greets the delighted ears of librarian 
and assistants at a certain great city library with 
many branches. Patrons of this institution have 
given uttterance to so many expressions of appre- 
ciation and gratitude for benefits received, that the 
library has issued an anthology of these eloquent 
tributes. This florilegium (to be sure, it is not in 
verse, or if it is the scansion is defective) is entitled, 
" Results not Shown by Statistics in the Work of 
the Public Libraries of Greater New York." We 
give a few choice extracts. An Irishman is reported 
as saying : " My children are getting so d n smart 
at school that I am obliged to use the library to keep 
ahead of them." " My ! " exclaimed another reader, 
in praise of the library's collection of music scores, 
I could hear two or three operas on the money I 
saved by coining to the library for music scores." 
A French woman, a semi-weekly frequenter of the 
library, said : " I don't know what we should have 
done without the library this winter. My husband 
and I could in former years go to the theatres once 
in a while; but this lias been such a hard winter 
that we could not afford any such luxuries. The 
library has furnished us with all our pleasures this 
winter." And another woman : " I have had a 
great deal of trouble. Everything in life has failed 
me, and if it were not for my books I should go 
crazy." This from a man of enterprise : " I was a 
barber, and have been able to become an electrician 
with the aid of the books in the library." And so 
on, through fourteen pages of fine print, in far 
greater variety and detail than can here be even 
hinted at. It is a little book to warm the librarian'* 
heart. . . , 

A SUGGESTION TO BUYERS OF GIFT-BOOKS for 

Christmas may not be out of order. Many places 
too small to support a good book-store do maintain 
an excellent public library, and at the library may 
be seen and examined, with the aid and consent of 
the librarian, a collection of recent and desirable 
holiday publication-, from which certain title.-, with 
publishers' names and perhaps also with prices, 
may be noted for subsequent orders on the nearest 
book-dealer. The public library of Jackson, Michi- 
gan, makes a practice of exhibiting at this season 



1910.] 



THE DIAL 



511 



books suitable for gifts to children. It might well 
make its exhibition more comprehensive, as the 
grown-ups, too, like to receive presents in the shape 
of books. The Jackson method may be indicated by 
an extract from the current Report of the librarian. 
" The Christmas exhibition of Children's books 
suitable for gifts was again held, and attracted 
much attention. Upon request to the publishers 
seventy-two books were donated, and forty-two were 
lent us by the State Library ; the total number of 
books shown was 235. . . . The present collection 
of gift books for children has been of great use to 
teachers and parents, and inquiries about it have 
come from all over the State." 

THE POEM THAT THE PEOPLE LIKE BEST, according 
to the editor of the " Notes and Queries " department 
of the Boston " Transcript," seems to be that favorite 
of our tender years, " The Blackberry Girl," by Mrs. 
Nancy Dennis Sproat. No other piece of verse is 
asked for and inquired about so often as this touch- 
ing tale of piety and poverty, beginning, as many will 
remember : 

" Why, Phoebe, are yon come so soon ? 

Where are your berries, child ? 
You cannot, sure, have sold them all : 
You had a basket piled." 

The whole story of blackberries spilled and the 
anguish of dark despair and the final emergence of 
the sun of happiness from behind the thunder-clouds 
of gloom takes twenty-one of these four-line stanzas 
in the telling. They were published as early as 
1829, in Boston, in a collection of Mrs. Sproat's 
writings entitled " Stories for Children in Familiar 
Verse." But it is probable that " The Blackberry 
Girl " had already been separately given to the 
world in some newspaper or other periodical. In 
1833 it re-appeared in a reading-book called " The 
Child's Guide," published by the old and famous 
house of George Merriam, at Springfield. Probably 
few, even of those who best remember the poem, are 
aware that it had a sequel, " What the Blackberry 
Girl Learned at Church, or The Blackberry Girl 

Continued." 



THE LATE PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF 

VERMONT, who died Nov. 29, at Burlington, was 
one of our comparatively few scholars of the good 
old sort, well-versed in the Greek and Latin classics, 
and master of a literary style at once ornate and 
clear. It is now thirty-nine years since Matthew 
H. Buckham succeeded Dr. James B. Angell (upon 
the latter's acceptance of the presidency of Michigan 
University) as head of the University of Vermont; 
and in that time he has added to the laurels of 
scholarship the well-earned fame of an able admin- 
istrator, and the institution under his direction has 
flourished notably. The mere titles of some of his 
printed discourses indicate the breadth and sanity 
of his mind, as, for example, " The Love of Diffi- 
culty," "The Culture of the Imagination," "Dead 
Languages Forsooth," " The Real Bible," " Reserve 
in Matters of Religion," and " The Economic Sit- 



uation." He was an occasional contributor to 
educational magazines, but his lifework is more 
substantially commemorated in the later buildings 
and professorships of the Vermont University than 
in the domain of literature. 



TO RELIEVE THE PRESSURE OF DEMAND FOR THE 

LATEST LIBRARY BOOKS the obvious thing to do is to 
buy additional copies if the requisite funds are 
available. The generous policy of the Springfield 
(Mass.) City Library is thus stated in the current 
Report of that well-managed institution : " When- 
ever four names are on the waiting list for a book, 
unless the demand appears purely spasmodic, an 
additional copy is bought. This applies chiefly to 
new and popular works of non-fiction. Standard 
works for which the demand is fairly constant 
should usually be obtainable with less delay, and 
especial attention has been paid to procuring suffi- 
cient copies of such books. Libraries do not hesi- 
tate to buy many copies of the new, more-or-less 
ephemeral fiction, and it would seem to be no less 
a duty to multiply copies of the standard histories, 
biographies, and other works of literature. Readers 
unable to obtain books readily may have their wants 
attended to by filling out a slip entitled 'Books 
never in.'" This liberality of supply may, and 
indeed must, lead to congestion, sooner or later, in 
certain instances of books over-rated at the time of 
their appearance. But there are always springing 
up new public libraries to which the less desired 
duplicates are likely to .prove an acceptable offer- 
ing ; and so the greatest benefit to the greatest 
number will be effected.

THE DEATH OF LIBRARIAN BURR OF WILLIAMS 
COLLEGE deprives that institution of one of its most 
useful and most highly esteemed faculty members. 
A graduate of the college (class of '68), Charles H. 
Burr was called in 1888 from the pastorate of the 
Bethany Congregational Church in New York to 
take charge of the library of his alma mater, where 
he devoted twenty-two years of skilled service to the 
formidable task of transforming an old-fashioned, 
rudely classified, imperfectly catalogued, and laxly 
administered college library into a modern, scien- 
tifically classified, adequately catalogued, and wisely 
managed college library. Like many another de- 
voted to the somewhat dry technicalities of this 
learned profession, Mr. Burr had a dry humor of his 
own that cropped out in speech and in writing; 
and he will be missed not only for his scholarly and 
administrative ability, but also for his genialty and 
companionableness as a man. 


THE PERIODICAL POETRY OF THE YEAR has been

a poet of repute, in accordance with his custom of 
the last six years, and his results are published in

selects for his purpose six magazines that, as he 
affirms, " publish the best, and not only the best, but

the greatest number of poems." These six encour- 
agers of contemporary poets are "The Atlantic," 
44 The Century," " Scribner's," "Harper's," *'Mc- 
Clure's," and * Lippincott's," which in the year now 
closing have published, respectively, 34 poems (12 
of distinction), 69 (19 of distinction), 42 (13 of 
distinction), 62 (16 of distinction), 36 (9 of dis- 
tinction), and 48 (8 of distinction). It 'is note- 
worthy, but not surprising, that the - Atlantic" has 
the highest proportion of distinguished poems, ac- 
cording to Mr. Braithwaite's rating. He chooses 
six for reprinting at the end of his article, and of 
these three are from the "Atlantic," two from the 
" Century," and one from " Scribner's," the names 
of the six poets thus crowned being Grace Fallow 
Norton, George Edward Woodberry, Louise Imogen 
Guiney, Ellen Angus French, Cale Young Rice, and 
Timothy Cole. . . . 

THE TERCENTENARY CELEBRATION OF AN ENG- 
LISH CLASSIC known by name at least to every one, 
and by far the " best seller " in the book-trade of 
to-day, is to be held next April. It ought to be 
superfluous to give the name of this book, one or 
more copies of which are to be found in nearly 
every English-speaking household in the land, and 
the phraseology of which has made a permanent 
place for itself in our spoken and written language ; 
and yet it may not instantly occur to every one that 
in the year 1611, on a day now no longer accurately 
determinable, there was published in England that 
masterpiece of clear, forcible, idiomatic, and pic- 
turesque English, the King James version of the 
Bible. It is proposed by the American Bible So- 
ciety to devote the first Sunday after Easter to a 
general commemoration of this publishing event. 
Among the topics suggested for addresses and lec- 
tures are these: "The story of the growth of the 
English Bible from the first translations to the 
King James version," " Later revisions and trans- 
lations," "The influence of the Bible on English 
literature," "The influence of the Bible on customs, 
laws, government, and social life," and "The English 

Bible and civil liberty." 



GENIUS AND MADNESS have ever been regarded 
as closely akin. The gift of poetry is especially 
likely to be confused with unsoundness of mind by 
the severely practical. "Ant iruanit homo, aut 
versus facit," Horace makes his slave Davus say 
of him. Sophocles in his old age was charged with 
insanity by his unfilial son lophon, and was sum- 
moned by him before the Phratores, to whom he 
read, in proof of his mental soundness, a splendid 
passage from his lately-written but not yet produced 
"CEdipus at Colonus," and so made his poetry clear 
him of that suspicion of imbecility which, had he 
been a stock-broker or a hardware-dealer instead of 
a poet, would probably never have rested upon him. 
And now, si parva licet componerc magnis, a poet 
of no mean ability is said to have been recently 
discovered in a Minnesota asylum for the insane. 
Was it her addiction to poetry that caused her con- 



finement? Still another public institution (a peni- 
tentiary tlii- time) of the name State shelters a 
writer of verse that has met with acceptance in 
high quarters in the magazine world; and the 
alleged reason for his seclusion too may be defined 
as a sort of insanity, if one takes the view that all 
sin is but unsoundness, or insanita*, of the moral 
nature. But, after all is said, there remains a large 
proportion of the mentally or morally mad who 
possess neither poetic n<>r :in\ other kind of genius: 
and also there are many poets and poetasters who 
have never incurred the faintest suspicion of any 
sort of phrensy, either divine or diabolical. 



THE PROFITS OF PASTIME are not always con- 
fined to those returns of enjoyment and reinvigora- 
tion that make pastime so emphatically worth while. 
Sometimes a person's play is more remunerative, 
pecuniarily, than his serious labor. Lewis Carroll 
(or Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, as he was known to 
his friends and acquaintances) varied the monotony 
of preaching sermons and writing textbooks on 
higher mathematics by giving the rein to his playful- 
ness of humor in those immortal adventures of Alice 
that so delighted the circle of little girls who formed 
his audience, and that have since been the joy of 
other children of all ages up to ninety or over. One 
is glad to learn, from the life of Lewis Carroll now 
added to the season's stock of good books, that these 
merry whimsicalities of his leisure hours yielded 
him such returns that he could devote himself to

A MOUNTAIN OF BOOKS, or something approach- 
ing it, confronts the sight-seer in Berlin who visits 
the new Royal Library. The rambling old palace 
that formerly held this precious collection of books 
has been superseded by the nearest approach to a 
sky-scraper known to the library world. The new 
building towers aloft to the height of thirteen stories, 
and its bookstack contains more than fifty miles of 
shelving, or capacity therefor, its 1,300,000 books 
filling already nearly thirty-two miles of this shelv- 
ing. In fifty years, or in less time if the world's 
production of books continues at its present rate of 
annual increase, this many-storied stack will be filled. 
But there is always plenty of room at the top, and, 
within the limits imposed by building laws and laws 
not made by man, bookstacks can always grow in 
an upward direction. However, before another halt- 
century has passed perhaps our librarians will in- 
vent some satisfactory sifting process to relieve the 
pressure on their shelves, or possibly a second Omar 
will solve the problem by burning our enormous 
collections of books and giving us a chance to he- MI 
over again.

cern us. What does concern all interested in curio- 
sities of literature is the finding of an early treatise 
on aerial navigation from the pen of no less a cele- 
brity than Jean Jacques Rousseau. " Men walk on 
the earth," says Rousseau, " they sail on the water, 
and swim in it. Is not the air an element, like the 
others. What business have the birds to shut us 
out of their domain while we are made welcome in 
that of the fishes?" To Rousseau's restless and 
inquiring mind the problem of man-flight resolved 
itself into the two subsidiary problems of finding a 
body lighter than air and so capable of rising, and, 
secondly, of discovering some means to make it stop 
rising and (hardest of all) to compel it to descend. 
'' Le Nouveau D^dale " for thus the little book was 
happily named is said to have first found its way 
into print in the year 1801 ; but it was ahead of its 
day, and so lapsed into speedy oblivion, to be revived 
a century later. 

A TWICE-TOLD TALE OF THE STEAMBOAT that IS 

curious enough to merit a passing note is to be 
read in the two like-named and simultaneously pub- 
lished books of the season, " Steamships and their 
Story" by Mr. E. Keble Chatterton, and "Steam- 
Ships and their Story " by Mr. R. A. Fletcher, 
both large octavos, illustrated with almost equal 
profusion and partly in color, and pursuing much 
the same plan of tracing the development of the 
latest turbine monster of the deep from the earliest 
beginnings of steamboat construction. This is 
another instance of the mysterious impulse that so 
often prompts two persons (or it may be three or 
more) to say or write the same thing at the same

THE END OF THE CHAUCER SOCIETY is announced

is now in prospect. Established in 1868, the society's 
original intention was to continue in existence for 
about twenty or thirty years, whereas it has now 
been beneficently active for forty-two years, doing 
excellent work in the elucidation and publication of 
Chaucer texts. It has earned a rest from its labors.

PRESIDENT FOLK'S DIARY. 
(To the Editor of THE DIAL.) 

In your issue of November 16 appears a long review 
of " President Folk's Diary," lately published in your 
city from the original manuscript now owned by the 
Chicago Historical Society. The reviewer observes of 
the Bancroft copy of that Diary, in the Lenox Library 
at New York, that the only writers who have yet drawn 
upon it are two recent ones specified by him, and he 
calls repeated attention to the rich opportunity for new 
historical research afforded by the present publication. 

I should like to point out that the Lenox Library 
copy of " Folk's Diary," clearly typewritten, and hand- 
somely bound, and purchased long ago with the MSS. 
Collection left by George Bancroft, has been known and 
appreciated for many years by historical investigators, 



of whom I may claim to be the earliest, as well as the 
first to call public attention to the work and make state- 
ment of its contents. In 1894 I made a diligent study 
of all the Polk papers in that collection, and published 
two articles in the "Atlantic Monthly" in 1895 
" President 'Polk's Diary " (August), and " President 
Folk's Administration" (September). Both of these 
articles were reprinted in my volume of " Historical 
Briefs," published in 1896. 

That President Polk's papers were well preserved by 
his widow in Tennessee and included his own "Diary" 
of his administration, I learned from Mr. Bancroft 
himself in 1887 ; and the circumstances under which he, 
that same year, procured the copies from Mrs. Polk for 
his own use in Washington, are detailed in the former 
of these articles. While preparing the narrative of 
President Polk's Administration for my "History of 
the United States" (Vols. 4 and 5) I tried in vain to 
get access to to these copies; and as soon as the Ban- 
croft manuscripts were purchased and made available 
the venerable author having died in 1891 I hastened 
to examine them, by way of revising my own volume, 
published shortly before. The two " Atlantic Monthly " 
articles were intended as a sequel commentary to my 
narrative; and when in 1904 new plates were made for 
my History I revised the text so as to incorporate the 
new material. 

Mrs. Polk survived George Bancroft several years; 
and as the ex-President's papers did not come into the 
market until long after the Bancroft Collection had 
been purchased by the Lenox Library, these copies of 
the Polk papers were readily accessible to scholars long 
before the originals. I presume that the Lenox Library 
copy of "Polk's Diary" is full and accurate in all 
respects. JAMES SCHOULER. 

Boston, Mass., Dec. 3, 1910. 

[I am extremely sorry that in writing the review 
of " Polk's Diary," I was in ignorance of the fact 
that Mr. Schouler had used it and printed material 
based upon it, previous to its publication. In at- 
tempting to check the statements in the preface 
and introduction, to the effect that the Diary had 
" occasionally been used " by historians, I naturally 
turned first of all to Mr. Schouler's well-known 
work. Unfortunately, that happened to be the first 
edition of the "History of the United States," in 
preparing which the Diary was not accessible to the 
author. I failed to examine either the later edition 
or the "Historical Briefs." These omissions I 
greatly regret. That Mr. Schouler has made use 
of the Polk MSS. is not surprising ; it is only sur- 
prising that the reviewer should not know of such 
use by a scholar of reputation. This, however, is 
the case. While the Lenox Library copy of the 
Diary undoubtedly offered opportunities to those 
who could get to it, the appearance of the Diary in 
print is surely a genuine "incentive to research." 
Neither Mr. Reeves nor Mr. Garrison, whom I men- 
tioned, used the Lenox Library copy exclusively; 
the former had resource both to the Chicago MSS. 
and to the copy; and the latter had the Chicago 
MSS. copied expressly for his own use. What I 
have meant to say is that the Diary in print is now 
widely available, and that no writer has exhausted 
its content or bearing. THE REVIEWER.]

A PUBLICIST OF Two NATIONS.* 

The late Goldwin Smith's book of " Reminis- 
cences " expresses the conclusions of one who 
was deeply occupied with the general welfare ; 
who came into large and varied contact with the 
leading persons and events of his time, and 
Drought to their consideration an independent, 
penetrative, and judicial mind. The author 
says of himself that he was not ambitious, and 
the events of his life seem to confirm this opin- 
ion. He was more than once solicited to run 
for office; yet, with liberal means and delicate 
health, he never allowed himself to come under 
the exactions of hard labor. In boyhood he 
was a scholar at Eton, where he came in contact 
with boys who were to play a prominent part in 
life. Later he was a student at Oxford, where 
he became a tutor and then a professor the 
last and the most permanent position that he 
held in England. The period of the profes- 
sorship is given as 1858-1866, and was later 
than his residence in London. He was a member 
of several public commissions fitted to add to 
his influence. He was interested in current 
events in Ireland, in our Civil War, and in the 
insurrection in Jamaica. In all these move- 
ments and events the spirit of philanthropy 
prevailed with him. 

Prior to his Oxford professorship, he began 
the study of law in London, but found its 
demands too severe for his health. He spent 
several years in London, and for three years 
was on the staff of " The Saturday Review." 
In 1868 he made a second journey to America, 
and became for two years professor in Cornell 
University. He removed thence to Toronto, 
where he remained some forty years, until his 
recent death. 

These diverse experiences were interspersed 
with travels, visits to Europe and to Amer- 
ica. While not under the pressure of cur- 
rent events, he was profoundly interested in 
them, and bore by personal intercourse and by 
writing a part in them. His interest was con- 
fined to no one class or country, and was never 
locked up in a particular philanthropy. As a 
student in Oxford he was brought in contact 
with the leaders in the Tractarian Movement. 
His religious feelings are not prominent in the 
" Reminiscences," and yet we are led to feel that

the opinions and methods In- encountered were 
ofton distasteful to him. He was conversant 
with men of literary eminence, and gives us an 
occasional criticism. What he says of Emerson 
is so concurrent with my own feeling that I 
give it in full : 

" I cannot honestly say that 1 ever got nim-h from his 
writings. I can find no system; I find only aphorisms; 
an avalanche, as it were, of unconnected pebbles of 
thought, some of them transparent; some translucent, 
some to me opaque. Carlyle introduced Emerson to 
the British public as one who brought new fire from 
the empyrean. But the two men in genius were 
leagues apart, and Carlyle at last found the new fire 
a bore." 

Goldwin Smith was thoroughly democratic 
in his tendencies, and judged men and things 
chiefly in their bearing on the general wel- 
fare. It was political events more than other 
events that occupied his mind. He regarded 
as the deepest issue in our Civil War the 
cardinal difference between slavery and free- 
dom. He did not allow this issue to be pushed 
aside or covered up by any secondary issues 
which might have arisen in connection with 
it. While he seems to us to do full justice 
to Lincoln, he does not fall into the indiscrim- 
inate laudation that has become the fashion. 
As one who, in a living experience, was familiar 
not only with the war but with the events that 
preceded it and prepared the way for it, I have 
felt that Lincoln's chief merit lay in his un- 
failing honesty. He entertained all forms of 
human welfare according to the measures of 
his own character, and never allowed himself to 
forget them or to be turned from them by im- 
mediate interests. He did not, however, enter 
into the depths of the ethical struggle involved 
in the war. He entertained the apologetic and 
partial reasons which occupied public attention 
and concealed in part the true force of events. 
The working classes in England had a more 
thoroughly correct view of the war than most 
Americans. The question was not whether we 
should allow another nation to spring up on the 
soil of the United States, but whether a slave- 
holding nation should establish itself at our 
side with exacting and hostile claims. A war 
was inevitable, should we meet it in its ear- 
liest and weakest form, or allow the forces of 
evil full opportunity of accumulation ? Lincoln 
felt the crisis, but rather as a national crisis 
than one in the history of the world. His 
methods had sufficient patience and insight to 
succeed, but hardly enough to turn victory into 
moral enthusiasm. The things most striking 
in his addresses, as that at Gettysburg, was the 



1910.]

perfectly simple and straightforward way in 
which he contemplated the facts. 

We have stood as a nation for democratic 
principles, the universal recognition of human 
rights; but it has been largely because our 
interests have been identified with these princi- 
ples rather than because we have accepted them 
as of universal application. When prosperity in- 
vited a departure from fundamental opinions, we 
have readily strayed into the forbidden paths 
of tyranny. We have been fortunate in our 
European admirers; they have been truer 
than we have been to our best convictions. 
Carl Schurz and Goldwin Smith felt at once 
the derelictions into which we were falling. 
Goldwin Smith could see but little in the pres- 
ent Republican Party of the promise contained 
in its early history. While he regarded our 
present pension system as a negation of merit 
and a complete subserviency of politicians to 
an unscrupulous vote, the only good he saw in 
it was an enormous expense frightening us 
from war. His repugnance to war rested on a 
sense of the immense evil it brings to society. 

Among those in English politics on whose 
character and services the writer dwells were 
Disraeli, Gladstone, and Cardwell. The latter 
was for a time Irish Secretary, and thus in- 
volved in that tangle of evils, impossible of 
correction, which has so long perplexed both 
peoples. To have brought any firm and suffi- 
cient policy to Ireland is the highest of records. 
Acknowledging the wonderful power and facil- 
ity of execution which belonged to Gladstone, 
Goldwin Smith saw also clearly the restricted 
action of his mind in some directions, and the 
rapidity with which he was liable to fall into 
extreme measures. 

Goldwin Smith's dislike of Disraeli was so 
strong as somewhat to overstrain his candor. 
The success of Disraeli in English politics is 
proof both of his own power and the perversion 
of thought still possible in England. The cur- 
rent of censure directed against Disraeli, though 
well deserved, has doubtless carried away at 
times the banks of the stream, and tumbled 
some shapely trees into the river. 

Goldwin Smith belonged to the Manchester 
school, the school of free trade so long and so 
beneficently led by Cobden and Bright. Per- 
haps no man in English politics preserved so 
uniformly a broad and generous view in his 
speeches as did Bright. Sound sentiment in 
trade seemed to temper all his thinking and im- 
part to him a universal philanthropy. Goldwin 
Smith escaped the narrowness that sometimes 



grew out of a single interest of trade. It was 
possible to attack protection simply as an ob- 
stacle to one's own occupation. Goldwin Smith 
was an advocate of trade unions as a necessary 
defense of the workman against the drift of 
social causes and the encroachments of capital. 
No class more needs a careful consideration of 
its own welfare and the assertion of its rights 
as a leading constituent in society. 

Goldwin Smith belonged to the class of con- 
stant, consistent, and reasonable critics, a 
class to which much of our progress will always 
be due. No temper requires more balance, more 
self-restraint, than the reformatory temper. It 
is one thing to figure a perfect social state, 
often in oversight of many new evils ready to 
be set in motion, and quite another thing to 
see and urge the correction that lies next in 
order. Goldwin Smith preserved his hold on 
active influential men while striving to enlarge 



and redirect their efforts.

VENICE ix HER, DECADENCE.* 



Perfection being inhuman, every book must 
perforce have some fault; yet just what is the 
fault of M. Philippe Monnier's " Venice in the 
Eighteenth Century" it is difficult to say 
unless it be an embarrassment of charm. 
Reading it now in the English translation after 
having read it in the original French a year or 
more ago, one's belief that it is an enchanting, 
as well as accurate, word-picture of a delightful, 
albeit decadent, age is thoroughly confirmed. 
Yet the reader must know Venice to enjoy to 
the full the charm of this book, so permeated 
is it with the spirit of the city of the lagoons. 
If you know Venice, M. Monnier will transport 
you there ; seat you in a frail gondola ; guide 
you through an enchanting maze of dark 
canaletti to the Lunetta; and there debark 
you so deftly that, when you follow him into the 
glorious piazza beyond, forgetful of the grime 
and soot of the material place in which you 
dwell, you will actually believe yourself to be 
in Venice at carnival a time when " there is 
no more day nor night, no more appointed hour 
for sleep or dinner, no more restraint, stability, 
or rule"; a time when " folly shakes her bells, 
fiddles are tuned, and all feet are agog to dance." 

Until the last page is turned, you will not 
realize that you have been reading a treatise as

French of Philippe Monnier. Boston : The Gorham Press.

scholarly as it is delightful ; for, although M. 
Monnier colors with the charm of a Watteau, 
his outlines are as true as the most rigid 
naturalist could demand. Indeed, he is what 
might be termed an artistic scholar, if that be 
not a paradox or, to put it more clearly, an 
artist who feels and a scholar who knows. 

Although he is erudite as well as artistic, 
M. Monnier has no sociological theories to 
propound, no historical lessons to preach. He 
realizes that the age he is portraying is a petty 
age, yet he knows that even in her decadence 
Venice remained great ; for, as he wisely puts 
it, "her greatness had been built upon the 
rock of her past, and this past was potent still." 
It is no mere word-artist who, studying that 
eighteenth century, so petty in Italy, so perti- 
nent in France, has the historical acumen to see 
that in that age Venice stands out conspicuously 
from the rest of Italy, not only because of her 
unique independence, but because she is the 
city where life was most vivid, most intense," 
and that " never in the whole of her history had 
she been freer of the influence of Rome than at 
this moment of supreme civilization ; never had 
she seemed more worthy of her cleverness and 
of her beautiful dialect, never more signally, 
more triumphantly Venetian" Furthermore, 
it takes a man of greater insight than the mere 
delightful chronicler of follies that M. Monnier 
appears to be in many instances, to analyze the 
very folly he is chronicling and make it clear 
to the reader that : 

" Never in the history of the world had there been a 
time when the element of tragedy was so conspicuously 
absent from the scheme of things. Never had human 
life been so void of all heroism. And never had there 
been such joyous, childish laughter in the world, as at 
this moment of termination to a period that reeked of 
passion and blood." 

Though history tempers M. Monnier's pages, 
his book is no history, but rather a series of 
dissolving views in which a people and an age 
are pictured with an artist's touch. Yet with 
all the bold dashes of color that illuminate these 
pages, the man who knows his Venice will feel 
that the color is characteristically true ; while 
he who has studied the particular age whereof 
M. Monnier writes will recognize that here that 
age is painted more charmingly, truthfully, and 
concisely than in any other book about it. 
Painted is the very word : no other will describe 
what the author has done ; even a bungling 
translator cannot wholly destroy the charm of 
such a colorful picture of Venice on a summer's 
day as this : 



"Out of a veil of tenderest blue, soft as mist, cradled 
in a translucent vapour, rises tin- city of the sea like a 
dream of rose and marble. Air and water seem to 
merge themselves with the vision of her past, and to 
weave for her a robe of fantasy, where opal and mother- 
of-pearl, coral, old ivory, and old silver are wedded in 
a riot of pink, palest violet, and lucent grey. Over 
everything there is a wonderful brightness. It bathes 
the domes, the cupolas, the towers of the city in an 
exquisite luminosity, displaying their spires and pinnac- 
les in a trellised daintiness more like lace than stone." 

The words "exquisite luminosity " have a 
euphuistic sound, but they are the translator's 
own, not a suggestion of them appearing in M. 
Monnier's original. Indeed it is to be hoped 
that the distinguished author of this book does 
not understand English, else a very bad quarter 
of an hour will be his when he reads his charm- 
ing work in our guttural tongue. Take, for 
instance, the very passage we have just quoted. 
In the original French it reads in this exquisite 
way: 

" Sur une soie d'azur tendre, dans une gaze de vapeur 
molle, au sein d'une poussiere lumineuse, surgit la cite* 
:ui;ul\ OIIHMU- comme une fantaisie de marbre rose. L'eau, 
le nuage et le passe* s'accordent a lui tisser uu vgtemeut 
de nuance, oh la nacre et 1'opale, le corail et la perle, 
le vieil ivoireet le vieil argent s'appellent, se re*pondent, 
se marient, se pament, s'^panchent en roses Verne's, en 
violets pales, en gris transparents et mobiles. Une 
clarte* charmante enveloppe et pdiietre les domes, les 
coupoles, les campaniles, qui y baignent leurs bulbes, 
qui y trempent leurs e*pis, qui y de'ploieut les graces 
ajourees d'une pierre en dentelle." 

The inapt translator has apparently been utterly 
baffled by M. Monnier's delightful imagery, 
not a vestige remaining in his garbled version 
of the thought that beautiful Venice rises out 
of the misty sea like Aphrodite Anadyomene 
at her birth. Yet M. Monnier's ima^rry is not 
really so baffling as it seems, and needs but to 
be translated to convey the very impressions he 
intended to convey, the following being but a 
literal rendering of the passage in question : 

" On a silk of tender blue, in a gauze of soft mist, on 
the breast of radiant spray, the Anadyomene city rises 
like a caprice of roseate marble. The water, the 
clouds, and the past conspire in weaving for her a 
various garment wherein nacre and opal, coral and 
pearl, old ivory and old silver call and respond one to 
another, wed, faint, and are disclosed in veined roses, 
pale violets, and transparent, changeable greys. AM 
enchanting light envelopes and penetrates the domes, the 
cupolas, and the church towers, which bathe their l>ull 
therein, steep their crests, and unfold the fretted 
charms of a stone in the form of lace." 

Here the original text has been followed far 
too conscientiously, it being apparent that 
" tissue " and " veil " are nicer words than 
"silk" and "gauze," and that a translator 
should not be too faithful in his allegiance to 



1910.] 



THE DIAL,

the Latin roots and construction of the original. 
Only in the word "fretted " has any great lib- 
erty been taken, the heraldic term " ajoure" 
although Englished, being too un-English to 
serve in even so literal a translation as is here 
attempted. The passage has been rendered thus 
faithfully in order to demonstrate the gross 
liberties the anonymous translator of this book 
has taken with M. Monnier's deft imagery ; for, 
although " translucent vapour," " lucent grey," 
and " exquisite luminosity " stand forth in vul- 
gar crudity, it is chiefly when imagery appears 
to confound him that he or, more likely, she 
demonstrates that just so long as Anglo- 
Saxon publishers, to pare shillings or dollars, 
confide the translating of foreign masterpieces 
to literary hacks instead of to literary artists, 
will foreign masters be butchered mercilessly. 

To return to M. Monnier's book and the 
petty age it pictures, it may be said that the 
men of Venice were quite as little as their age 
it being a truism that men make an age. Even 
Metastasio, great though his aspirations un- 
doubtedly were, is great only in comparison 
with the dwarfs who surround him. Though 
an artist of the grand style, Tiepolo, to quote 
M. Moimier (who seems ever to be aptly quot- 
able) " loved to delight his fancy with wonder- 
ful lights and strange architecture, beautiful 
draperies, beautiful forms, animals, and im- 
plements." 

Indeed, the only man of that period who 
refused to delight his fancy with lights and 
draperies and beautiful forms was Goldoni. 
Being a lover of his kind, with a keen obser- 
vance, this master of naturalistic comedy painted 
bits of life exactly as he saw them ; yet too short 
of sight to penetrate the broad atmosphere en- 
veloping the life he painted, he failed to see the 
relation of that life to the past or the future or 
even the times in which he lived ; therefore, 
though a great naturalist, he was not that 
higher thing, a great realist, such as Moliere 
proved himself to be in Le Misanthrope, Tar- 
tuffe, and Le Festin de Pierre. As a true 
picture of a bit of humorous life, Le Baruffe 
Chiozzotte is a masterpiece ; yet, though we may 
laugh at it till tears fill our eyes, while exclaim- 
ing how true it is, it will never make us ponder. 
Though the greatest man of his age in Italy, 
Goldoni must therefore be given a place on the 
second rung of the ladder, his limitations being 
due to the fact that, though he saw clearly and 
sanely everything about him, he never pondered 
upon the origin of the things he saw, upon their 
relation to each other, or upon their outcome. 



Understanding Goldoni as thoroughly as he 
understands his petty age, M. Monnier thus 
portrays both the charm and the limitations of 
this commanding figure of eighteenth century 
Venice : 

" No one ever invented more situations, imagined 
more events, wove more intrigues, arranged more in- 
cidents, seized more opportunities for fun, marshalled 
more characters, produced more persons, imparted more 
gaiety, and scattered or poured .out a greater profusion 
of his riches with more recklessness of heart. The 
laughter, which arose from this jumble, was frank and 
fresh, pure and unrestrained, thoughtless and untinged 
by bitterness. It rose in the air like the gay outburst 
of a joyful heart. 

" With the directness of a natural force and the 
elemental simplicity of a creature from a golden age, 
he calmed and simplified existence. Always eager and 
obliging, charitable and good-humoured, he was as un- 
defiled as water from a spring, as transparent as a 
crystal. Conscious of his limitations, he was content 
with the talents which he had, and employed them as 
he could. In spite of scorn and derision and mis- 
understanding, he triumphed over all obstacles with 
his smile, avenged all offences by forgiving them, and 
continued to vouchsafe to all, bad and sad and wicked 
alike, a salutary example of good-humor. Gran 
Goldoni' the crowd shouted with enthusiasm on Car- 
nival evenings dead and gone. For all these reasons 
he was great." 

Here Goldoni is not patriotically exalted, as 
many Italians have exalted him, nor chauvinis- 
tically belittled, as many Frenchmen have be- 
littled him, but justly given his true place as a 
naturalist, who "calmed and simplified exist- 
ence " and whose humor was the " gay outburst 
of a joyful heart." Nor is he deified as the 
" Moliere of Italy," be it remarked, a mis- 
nomer beneath the crushing weight of which 
Goldoni has all but perished. On the contrary, 
he is Italy's Gran Goldoni the most "salu- 
tary example of good humor " in the entire 
realm of the drama. 

This judicial quality makes M. Monnier's 
book valuable ; its charm has already been set 
forth, therefore little need be added except to 
say that it tells of gaiety and love in Venice as 
well as of that Sybaritic city's literature, music, 
and drama in the century of her decay ; tells, 
too, of how her people lived and of how her 
freedom perished when the span of its pleasure- 
loving life had been run. It is a book for 
Platonists, however, not for matter-of-fact 
Aristotelians ; and, furthermore, it is a book 
for those who love Italy and particularly Venice. 
By these it should be read ; but in the original 
French if possible, much of its charm being 
lost in the translation.

His Excellency Ching Shan, while the Boxers

and with this statement will everyone agree 
who reads the intensely interesting pages of 
China under the Empress Dowager." Only 
two years dead, it is impossible to pans a final 
verdict upon her wonderful career ; but one 
thing seems certain beyond peradventure of 
doubt, the "Old Buddha" will stand out as 
one of the great women of all time, and as the 
greatest of Chinese queens. 

The story of her life seems like a page out 
of some mediaeval romance rather than one writ 
in the full light of the nineteenth century. And 
what a life it was ! Born of good parentage, in 
1835, selected as an Imperial concubine when 
not yet seventeen, she soon became the favorite 
of her dissolute master, and later, as mother of 
his heir, her position was unassailable. These 
were stirring times within the Empire. In the 
southern provinces the Taipings were apparently 
in full control, with Nanking as their capital ; 
and to this great rebellion, unequalled in modern 
history, was added a war with England and 
France which only ended with the capture of 
Peking and the flight of the Imperial house- 
hold to Jehol, beyond the Great Wall. For the 
first time Tzu Hsi knew the sorrows of hurried 
flight before the "outer barbarians," who on 
this occasion destroyed the Summer Palace. 

It was at Jehol that the Empress faced the 
first great conspiracy against her. The emperor, 
Hsien-Feng, had been failing rapidly. His 
death would necessitate a regency, and three of 
the Manchu nobles laid their plans to secure 
this power for themselves. Their success seemed 
assured, but they had reckoned without Tzu 
Hsi; their authority was short-lived, for on 
the return to Peking she asserted her rights, 
and the conspirators were condemned to suicide 
or a felon's death. 

Then began the first Regency (1861-1873), 
in which she formally shared authority with 
Tzu An, the late Empress Consort ; but as a 
matter of fact the latter generally deferred to 
her more vigorous colleague, and rarely did 
Tzu Hsi have to force her will upon her <>-

Regent. This period saw the collapse of the 
Taiping Rebellion, to which result tin- KmpreBB 
Dowager contributed through her whole-hearted 
support of the great Viceroy, Tseng Kuo-fan. 
With the coming to age of her son, the 
Emperor T'ung-Chih, the joint Regency ex- 
pired, and the supreme authority was nominally 
vested in the weak and dissipated youth. But 
the Dowager had tasted the sweets of power, 
and she could brook no interference. It was to 
her interest that in the event of her son's early 
death no heir remain to cause the widowed con- 
sort to become the Empress Dowager. So it 
has been widely believed that Tzu Hsi encour- 
aged the youthful Emperor in his dissipations, 
and did nothing to protect him from their evil 
effects. At any rate, in January, 1875, the 
Emperor succumbed to small-pox, and " as- 
cended the Dragon to become a guest on high." 
Then came the question of the succession. The 
young Empress was enceinte, and should a son 
be born he would become Emperor, which was 
not to the taste of Tzu Hsi. Supported by 
faithful officials and troops, she called a council 
of the Clansmen and high officials, and in spite 
of all opposition secured the succession of her 
sister's son, a grandson of the Emperor Tao- 
Kuang. In this way Tzu Hsi retained her 
authority, for the former co-Regents were 
continued, and the widowed Empress completely 
ignored. A few months later her death was 
recorded, by suicide it was reported officially, 
but there were many who read a more sinister 
meaning into the pathetic story. 

The enforced selection of Kuang-Hsu as 
Emperor caused a storm of protests from both 
Chinese and Manchus, for it meant a violation 
of the dynastic law and of the fundamental 
principle of ancestor worship. The heir should 
have been of a younger generation in order 
that he might perform the proper rites before 
his adopted parent's shrine. In this case the 
late Emperor was left without an heir, while the 
new Emperor was proclaimed as the adopted 
son of his uncle, the Emperor Hsien-Feng, and 
it was promised that as soon as a son was born 
he would act as the adopted son of the late 
Emperor. But this explanation was not satis- 
factory to many of the loyal supporters of the 
throne. 

The second Regency was marked by increas- 
ing bitterness between the co-Regents, to such 
an extent that the sudden death of the Empress 
T/ u An. in 1881, occasioned many misgivings.

solemn mysteries of the Forbidden City, the 
woman who later, because of her failure to pro- 
vide an Jieir to the Throne, had effaced herself 
in favour of the Empress Mother, her poor- 
spirited rival of many years Tzu An would 
trouble her no more. Henceforth, without 
usurpation of authority, Tzu Hsi was free to 
direct the ship of State alone, sole Regent of 
the Empire." 

In February, 1889, the " Old Buddha," as 
she was now familiarly called, handed over 
her powers to the Emperor, and for almost ten 
years she enjoyed a respite from her arduous 
labors ; but even among the pleasures of the 
restored Summer Palace she did not lose track 
of the developments in Peking. In this period 
came the disastrous war with Japan, for which 
the Empress Dowager was not a little blamed, 
especially because of the diversion of funds 
designed for the navy to the rebuilding of the 
Summer Palace, and for the protection afforded 
Li Hung Chang, who by the southern Chinese 
especially was looked upon as an arch-traitor. 

With the death of Prince Kung, the respected 
head of the Grand Council, the Emperor fell 
under the influence of the Cantonese reformer, 
K'ang Yu-wei. Then began the " Hundred 
Days of Reform." Decrees were issued in rapid 
succession reforming the system of education 
and examination ; the army and navy were to 
be reorganized, and reforms in other depart- 
ments of government were announced. But 
all the time the Emperor and the reformers 
realized that their most dangerous obstacle was 
the " Old Buddha." If she approved, all would 
go well ; if she opposed, the result would be 
disaster. This led to the cleverly-planned 
coup d'etat which should have resulted in the 
arrest and confinement of the Empress Dow- 
ager and the execution of her loyal supporters. 
Yuan Shi-k'ai was selected as the leading actor 
in this palace revolution. He was to seize 
Jung Lu, Viceroy of Chihli and Commander- 
in-Chief of the foreign-drilled army, and also 
the most loyal servant of the Empress Dowager. 
Then, after having him beheaded, he was to 
lead the disciplined troops to Peking and there 
arrest the Empress. The plan was excellent, 
but the agent was human. 

" Yuan reached Tientsin before noon, and proceeded 
at once to Jung Lu's Yamen. He asked Jung Lu 
whether he regarded him as a faithful blood brother. 
(The two men had taken the oath of brotherhood 
several years before.) < Of course I do,' replied the 
Viceroy. You well may, for the Emperor has sent me 
to kill you, and instead, I now betray his scheme, 
because of my loyalty to the Empress Dowager and of 



my affection for you.' Jung Lu, apparently unaffected 
by the message, merely expressed surprise that the Old 
Buddha could have been kept in ignorance of all these 
things, and added that he would go at once to the capital 
and see the Empress Dowager that same evening. Yuan 
handed him the Emperor's decree, and Jung Lu, travel- 
ling by special train, reached Peking soon after 5 p. m." 

From that moment events moved with startling 
rapidity. The Empress Dowager grasped the 
situation " with the courage and masculine 
intelligence that enabled her to overcome all 
obstacles," and a secret conference of the Con- 
servative leaders was arranged. In less than 
two hours the whole of the Grand Council, 
several of the Manchu princes and nobles, and 
many of the high officials were gathered together, 
and "on their knees, the assembled officials 
besought her to resume the reins of government 
and to save their ancient Empire from the evils of 
a barbarian civilization." Early the next morn- 
ing the Emperor was seized, and a decree issued 
in his name which stated that he had begged 
the Empress Dowager " to condescend once 
more to administer the Government " and that 
she had graciously consented. Then came the 
punishment of the reformers, although K'ang 
Yu-wei escaped in a British war-ship to Hong 
Kong, and later many of the reform decrees 
were reversed. The Emperor still lived, and 
there were many who believed that his " sudden 
death" was to be expected and, when the blow 
did not fall, believed that only fear of the south- 
ern Chinese and of foreign opinion caused the 
Empress to spare her traitorous nephew. 

Following closely upon the revolution of 1898 
came the Boxer Rising of 1900. The material 
for this period is of supreme interest, for it is 
thg diary of His Excellency Ching Shan, a 
Manchu kinsman of the Empress Dowager's 
family who had held many high offices until 
his retirement in 1894. With the entry of the 
allied forces, three of the women of his house- 
hold committed suicide, and he was murdered 
by his own son. The diary was found in his 
study, and saved from destruction at the hands 
of a party of Sikhs. It is a most remarkable 
human document. The Boxer madness is de- 
scribed from the inside. The hopes of the 
Empress that at last an instrument had been 
provided for the complete destruction of the 
hated barbarians, her rage at the fraudulent 
despatch from the Ministers demanding her 
abdication, the murder of von Ketteler, the Ger- 
man Minister, the " unfathomable ignorance " 
of many of the Manchu nobles, the endeavors 
of far-sighted officials to stem the flood of un- 
reasoning hate, all are vividly portrayed. We

see her wavering between hopes and fears, cry- 
ing out for the destruction of all foreigners and 
again sending fruit and melons to the beseiged 
legations ; and we read a new explanation for 
the failure of the beseigers in the dogged refusal 
of Jung Lu to turn his cannon over to the 
Boxers. 

Then came the march of the allies upon 
Peking, and once again the Empress Dowager 
knew the privations of a hurried flight before 
the masterful barbarians. This experience 
taught a needed lesson. Out of it emerged a 
changed woman, penitent for the evils brought 
upon the Empire and genuinely eager for the 
reforms which she now realized were sorely 
needed. From 1901 until her death in 1908 
she moved in the front rank of the reformers, 
and her edicts even went beyond those that had 
caused the Emperor's retirement in 1898. The 
difference was this, that the Empress Dowager 
now urged reforms, and there was no one strong 
enough to oppose them. 

Such are the events portrayed in " China 
under the Empress Dowager." Full of interest 
they certainly are, and the treatment is in full 
accord with the theme. Even the memorials 
and edicts so frequently quoted contain a liter- 
ary charm seldom found in western state papers, 
and the extracts from the various diaries add a 
rare personal note. The book lends itself to 
quotation , especially the excellent final chapter, 
in which an attempt is made to analyze the 
secret of Tzu Hsi's power over men. To both 
the general reader and the special student, this 
well-told story of a great queen and a remark- 
able woman cannot fail to be of interest and

to see realized on the earth, and calling upon 
the rest of the world to see with their t \ 
And as for walking, there is no other way. 
They have all learned long since that those who 
touch even the hem of their divinity's garment 
come not in automobiles or express trains, but 
in the humility and labor of their own footing. 
He who knows most among them tramps most, 
and the first sacrifice demanded of the neo- 
phyte is a generous out-wearing of buskin and 
cothurnus. 

This season four princes among these ideal 
trampere are on the road, offering their com- 
panionship to all who will go with them four 
princes of varied tastes and temperaments, dif- 
fering both in the objects of their search and in 
their manner of talking by the way. Among 
them we best know Mr. Burroughs, whose breezy 
swinging stride or saunter as the case may 
demand over fields and through woodlands 
has put much good blood into our own veins. 
We are only too glad to renew our youth with 
him now by being taken a second time over 
some of the walks among the Catskills where 
Mr. Burroughs was born and where he learned 
to tramp. Good strenuous outings most of these 
are ; and some of them, such as are described 
in " The Snow- Walkers " and " A White Day 
and a Red Fox," furnish the seasonable inspira- 
tion which we need to keep us in the open in 
spite of cold and storms. The essay on the 
Southern Catskills, which tells of Mr. Bur- 
roughs's first ascent of Slide Mountain, is par- 
ticularly exhilarating. Others will be remem 
bered as among the author's best descriptions 
of bird life. Mr. Clifton Johnson's photographs 
are genuinely illustrative, and furnish some 
good portraits of Mr. Burroughs. 

Mr. Packard's " Wood Wanderings " are 
quiet strolls in less famous and less dramatic 
surroundings ; but one does not expect to take 
fairy walks in bold regions and we already 
know that when we walk with Mr. Packard we 
may expect to meet fairies. Starting out 
with the belief that " woodland glades and sun- 
dappled depths" may easily be peopled with 
fairies, sprites, and goblins, he sees that the 
fairies have stitched the poke-berries across the 
top to keep them from bursting, as is proved 
by the fact that " the marks of the needle show, 
and the tiny puckering made by drawing the 
thread very tight." He suspects the fairy 
urchins of taking l>it's from tin- partridge l>er- 
ries when their mothers are not looking, and is 
sure that the faint glow which you see in your

path when you walk the wood at night is cast 
by the candles in the jack-o'-lanterns which 
these same urchins make from trillium fruit. 
The same delicate wit serves him in all his 
hobnobbing with the woodland, and glints back 
at people in the world outside, making the 
quaintest associations. He can but feel, he 
says, that the pure lives of the birches " radiate 
an influence among the swamp maples," and 
explains : 

" Most of the lady birches stand aloof on the upland 
slopes; I notice not far enough away to forbid the 
handsome young maples from climbing out of their 
mire of dissipation to nibble the dry husks of gravel- 
bank breakfast food and drink dew among them if 
they have the courage. But not all thus withdraw in 
whispering groups. Down into the swamp others have 
stepped, and stand among the rubicund roisterers. 
Social workers these without doubt, missionaries of the 
birch C. T. U., who thus give their lives nobly to teach- 
ing by example." 

Under further special favor of the Brother- 
hood of Walkers, Mr. Packard received last year 
a roving commission which sent him south for 
the winter but on a good ship and not on foot, 
and gave his genius unlimited opportunity to 
exercise itself on " Florida Trails." The greater 
extent of this other spit of sand, which he says 
reminds him always of Cape Cod, has not 
blunted the fine point of his delightfully whim- 
sical but nevertheless accurate observation. 
" The Florida heron," he says, " wading leg 
deep in the St. Johns River, has the same self- 
conscious dignity, the same absurd rhythmic 
hesitancy of motion as a wedding procession 
going up the aisle. I have seen a great many 
grooms wade in and I never saw anything a bit 
different." Blue birds and butterflies, cherokee 
roses and crocodiles, jasmine and pelicans, pigs 
and palmettos, and all the other varied exuber- 
ances of Florida, become in turn the shrines of 
his reverent but fanciful devotion. A number 
of photographs bring sunny remembrances of 
Palm Beach, Indian River, the Everglades, and 
numerous Keys to those who perforce must take 
their Florida second-hand. 

A less well-known writer, Mr. Samuel C. 
Schmucker, in his group of essays entitled 
" Under the Open Sky," shows himself a com- 
petent instructor in this peripatetic school. It 
is quite wonderful to note how much informa- 
tion he imparts, with no malice prepense, and 
over how wide a range his wisdom extends. 
Has anyone told us before that in the spring 
the meadow-lark "because his yellow breast, 
now growing more brilliant in readiness for his 
nearing courtship, would betray him among the 
bare branches, is quite in the habit of turning 



his back to any living thing in the neighbor- 
hood whose movements he mistrusts "? Of the 
cricket he says : " His joy, so a scientist tells 
us, rises and falls so absolutely with the ther- 
mometer, that it is possible to calculate' the 
temperature with a reasonable degree of pre- 
cision by the pitch of the ericket's shrilling." In 
like manner we may learn from these carefully- 
written pages wherein consists the poison of the 
poison ivy, how the seventeen-year locust 
spends his cabalistic existence, what method the 
bee follows in fertilizing the violet, how tragic 
and loveless is the old age of the grasshopper, 
how Jack-in-the- Pulpit seasons his religion with 
pepper, and many other secrets. Numerous 
illustrations, both marginal and full-page, give 
a further lift to the imagination. 

We feel that all of these " delegates of the 
ideal " are poets at heart ; but it is nevertheless 
a pleasure to find among them a poet so prac- 
tised in verse-making that he finds it " easier to 
tell the strict truth in poetry rather than in 
prose." " October Vagabonds " is the enviable 
title of Mr. Le Gallienne's book, which in the 
reviewer's plain prose tells the story of a 
tramp from a summer paradise somewhere in 
western New York to some other place much 
nearer the city 

" Enchanted journey ! That begins 
Nowhere and nowhere ends." 

But there is little plain prose in the story ; for 
though not overweighted with verse, it is full 
of imagination and is there a better term 
than literary? fancy. If the word seems 
inappropriate at first, it proves gratefully 
true on perusal of the book ; for Mr. Le 
Gallienne, lacking the trained observation of 
the naturalist, sees in trees and fields and hills 
the outward embodiment of the dreams of poets 
and prophets with which his mind is stored. 
" Can anyone deny," he asks, " that the 
meadows of the world are greener for the 
Twenty-third Psalm, or the starry sky the 
gainer in our imagination by the solemn caden- 
ces of the book of Job ?" The orchards along 
the way grow more beautiful because they look 
like those in the country of King Alcinous, and 
the heavily-laden wains on the farms waken us 
to our identity with the past when they become 
" the slow-moving wagons of our Lady of 
Eleusis." Learners in this school of out-of- 
door idealism will be glad to know what books 
so keen a critic of the appropriate carried in 
his knapsack and found not irrelevant. They 
were these : J. W. Mackail's " Georgics," Hans 
Andersen's Fairy Tales, Shakespeare's Sonnets,

VARIETY ix CURRENT DRAMA.* 



Not within the memory of living man have 
acting dramas which yet make the literfcry ap- 
peal been published so freely as at the present 
time. The group here considered only a part 
of the season's promise, is proof of the state- 
ment, and significant of the fast-growing im- 
portance of the literary drama in all the lands 
where letters are cultivated. If the movement 
increases proportionately in the next few years, 
fiction, that modern tyrant among literary 
forms, will have to look to its laurels. 

M. Maeterlinck has done remarkable things 
with the play form. He has shown the value 
of indirection through an imaginative appeal 
which has subtilized psychology, and he has far 
surpassed Ibsen in the use of the subjective 
method. Only once, in Monna Vanna," has 
he produced an acting drama in the traditional 
sense ; although " Sister Beatrice," more ob- 
jective in motive, has considerable dramatic 
power, beautiful as it is pictorially and in con-

ception. " The Blue Bird," charming as spec- 
tacle and literature, is not a play in the strict 
sense. " Mary Magdelene," his new drama, 
seems som.'uliat disappointing, In-oans*- it larks 
objective dramatic power, while the historical 
demands seem to clip the author's genius and 
forbid a success of " The Intruder " type. Tin- 
main situation, to be sure, with the Roman 
soldier promising Mary to spare the Christ if 
she will give herself to the soldier, is of obvious 
dramatic value ; but there is a lack in the 
handling : it fails to thrill. There is a certain 
pictorial quality, too, in the scenes, notably 
that in the house of Joseph of Arimath&a, and 
in the effect of the mob in the garden of Silanns, 
with the Saviour invisible yet dominating the 
scene. It may well be that these skilful group- 
ings and plastic manipulations would lend the 
play fascination when witnessed. But on the 
whole, the material appears to be handled rather 
tamely, and it is doubtful if this drama can ever 
stand with the author's best ; although its good 
taste in the presence of a delicate theme, and its 
spiritual elevation, can be heartily recognized. 

After reading the three one-act pieces of Herr 
Sudermann grouped under the sombre title 
" Morituri," one instinctively asks what would 
be their fate if the author were not famous. 
They possess little or no dramatic quality, and 
whatever of literary charm is theirs is success- 
fully eliminated by the translator, whose En- 
glish is indifferent or worse than indifferent. 
To allow Herr Sudermann to be Englished by 
one with so little feeling for idiom, to whom the 
distinction even between "shall" and "will," 
for example, does not exist, is a pity. The first 
play, the historical sketch called "Teja," is the 
best of the trilogy, but in no way remarkable ; 
"Fritzchen" is slight and ineffective; and as 
for the final piece, " The Eternal Masculine " 
(a clever title that promises well), after two 
readings I am inclined to give it up, either 
the translation has ruined it, or it is far below 
the author's standard and dangerously near 
nonsense. Herr Sudermann's earlier play- 
group, * Rosen," while no more than minor 
work, and seamier in themes than the present 
set, was very much superior as drama. " Manila " 
and " The Joy of Living " truly seem far away 
in reading these later specimens of the same 
author's play-making. 

\V hatever the faults of Mr. Edward Sheldon's 
" The Nigger," nobody can read or sec it with- 
out recognizing that it is genuine drama, in 
contradistinction from the drama that is "liter- 
ary." And one relishes the vigor of this young-

est of aspirants, after the languid efforts of 
mature experts. When I saw the play at the 
New Theatre last winter, it was for me a 
vigorous and skilful piece, certainly with melo- 
dramatic touches, but handling a perilous theme 
in a way to make it inoffensive, while evoking 
from it a very strong central situation : the 
love of a Southern man supposedly white for a 
Southern girl, and the question of what she will 
do on discovering that he has negro blood in 
his veins. And now, reading the play, I feel 
that it has good workmanship, the artist's able 
control of his material ; it is a piece of liter- 
ature, which perhaps gets a bit didactic in the 
last act, but in general the story is allowed to 
speak for itself, and the situations are there and 
made much of. Moreover, it has the great 
merit of being about something, and that some- 
thing worth while ; the drama has a big idea. 
In view of the author's youth, this play and 
his preceding " Salvation Nell " are immensely 
promising for Mr. Sheldon's future, and he will 
hereafter be looked to as one of the torch- 
bearers. He is very much sur le mouvement. 

The advanced realism of the day the 
realism that has produced a Wedekind in Ger- 
many is well exemplified in Mr. John Mase- 
field's The Tragedy of Nan, and Other Plays." 
There is something terrible in finding the 
British rustic types, here studied, so revolting 
in their characteristics. This remark applies 
less aptly, perhaps, to the title-piece than to the 
two connected one-act pieces that follow, which, 
for straight, sullen horror have rarely been 
equalled in English. " Nan," a study of a 
girl whose lover leaves her, whereupon she kills 
him, is a skilful and forcible bit of dramatic 
work, which ought to act well. But judging 
Mr. Masefield by these examples, I should say 
that at present he has a chip on his shoulder 
for his dramatic theory : an attitude, whether 
for life or literature, not without danger to one 
assuming it. 

The Kussian genius, large, sombre, impres- 
sive, is not dramatic at all in the sense that the 
French genius is : I mean, in the feeling for 
form, development, and climax. There never 
was a more undramatic play than Gorki's ter- 
rible "Nachtasyl," and you have the same ex- 
perience with the dramas of Ostrovsky and 
Tolstoy. In fact, the Slav's desire to come to 
a grapple with life is, in a sense, a menace to 
his art. One realizes all this afresh when in 
contact with Leonid Andreyev's strange, slow- 
moving, awful, yet unquestionably gripping 
drama " Anathema." It is unthinkable as a 



playing piece. That tremendous prologue where 
the damned creature of earth jeers at the silent 
guardian of the heavens could not be visual- 
ized ; it is an effect for the imagination. Nor, 
one would guess, could much that follows be 
properly shown : the old Jew, David Leizer, is 
given a large fortune by Anathema, the Meph- 
isto of the story ; he dispenses it all in charity, 
the world turns and rends him, and Anathema, 
whose desire is to prove man bad and God 
cruel, triumphs over David's mangled corpse. 
It is a scene of frightful force and significance. 
But when, in the epilogue, this evil spirit re- 
visits the Maker of things, he finds that Good 
is still conqueror, and in rage returns to do more 
impotent evil upon the earth. The careless and 
light-minded will pass this creation by as baffling 
or even as absurd ; but it is a monumental alle- 
gory of good and evil, richly humanitarian, and 
of large and noble implications in its philosophy. 
One reads it in somewhat the same mood as that 
begotten by the Book of Job. And certainly 
it seems intensely Slavonic in character. 

Standing head and shoulders above every- 
thing else in the present group as drama is Mr. 
Galsworthy's superb " Justice," at once a vital 
piece of life and literature, and a play of un- 
questionable fine technique and evident acting 
value. In skill, verity, and life values, it stands 
by itself, so far, among this author's plays. No- 
wonder we hear that the English government 
has already been moved, through the influence 
of such a drama, to improve the existing prison 
regulations. They seem intolerable, thus pre- 
sented. " Justice " illustrates the power of the 
stage when used aright, albeit the dramatist be 
the sternest and most uncompromising of real- 
ists. Indeed, those who are looking merely for 
the vacuously pleasant in play form are warned 
away from this drama ; it is the most consistent 
and logical of tragedies. But it makes you 
think, it broadens your sympathy, it gives you 
the pleasure proper to a work of art. And 
therefore, for some of us at least, it is greatly 
worth while. The story concerns the fate of a 
young London clerk who, desiring money to- 
help the woman he loves (the wife of a drunken 
brute who makes her life wretched) forges, is 
caught, and is committed to prison. On coming- 
out, after serving his sentence, he feebly tries to 
be honest ; he secures a position, but his record 
hounds him ; the woman he loves is still his care, 
and his employers, kind men but taking the con- 
ventional view, tell him he must get rid of her. 
In a final scene, as poignantly true and pathetic 
as modern drama can show, we see the poor,

weak fellow caught again, and taking his own 
life ; while Ruth, ont of love for whom his sin 
has been committed, stands dazed with grief 
beside him. It is impossible to read this mov- 
ing social document, dramatically so masterly 
that one tingles with its cumulative power, with- 
out realizing, perhaps as never before, the spirit 
of good in things deemed evil ; and without 
registering a vow to be more charitable in the 
future. Although the drama arraigns the 
present reformatory procedure, it has a larger 
meaning too, I think ; it suggests the awful 
complexity of human society, the mystery of 
failure, the apparent injustice inherent in a 
world so often at sixes and sevens. Yet is the 
tone not bitter ; Mr. Galsworthy is above all 
an artist : he presents the facts as he sees them, 
he lets the facts be special pleaders for him. It 
is devoutly to be hoped that a play so sterling, 
so representative of the best in the modern 
realistic school, may soon be seen in this country.

That discriminating student of French cathedrals, 
Miss Elise Whitlock Rose, gives in her two-volume 
work on "Cathedrals and Cloisters of the Isle de 
France " (Putnam) a fitting sequel or companion to 
her earlier books on the cathedrals and cloisters of 
southern and midland France. As in those works, 
too, she has been ably seconded by Miss Vida Hunt 
Francis in the illustration of her chapters with nu- 
merous and excellent photographs. The grouping 
of the matter is not geographical, but by archi- 
tectural periods, early Gothic, mature Gothic, 
flamboyant, and pseudo-classic. The selection of 
material from so rich a field has been a perplexing 
question, but the two ample volumes contain enough 
to do fair justice to the subject. Naturally the 
authors were tempted to overstep the limits indi- 
cated by the book's title, and no one will quarrel 
with them for occasionally yielding to the tempta- 
tion. In general, the present work seems to do for 
northern France what its predecessors accomplished 
for central and southern France. The plates are 
both full-page and of smaller size, giving well both 
general effects and minute details. 

Following up his studies of the Borneo Head- 
Hunters with similar researches among the natives 
of another tropical island in the same quarter of 
the globe, Dr. William Henry Furness, 3rd, has 
written a substantial volume on " The Island of 
Stone Money : Uap of the Carolines " (Lippincott). 
The medium of exchange which gives its name to 
the book consists of "large, solid, thick, stone 
wheels, ranging in diameter from a foot to twelve 
et, having in the centre a hole varying in size with 



the diameter of the stone, wherein a pole may be 
inserted sufficiently large and strong to IH.-H- tin- 
weight and facilitate transportation." The origin 
and use of this cumbrous currency form the subject 
of one of the most entertaining chapters in tin- 
delightfully written book. Religion, burial rite-. 
native house*, costumes and adornments, Uap 
friendships, tattooing, dance and posture songs, 
and other things curious and novel, together with a 
treatise on Uap grammar and a seventy -four-page 
vocabulary of the language, fill up the rest of tin- 
volume. Thirty-one pictures, from photographs 
taken by the author, serve to make more real the 
strange scenes described. To the reader craving 
something new in the department of travel, The 
Island of Stone Money " can be cordially recom- 
mended. 

The terrible story of the great earthquake in 
Sicily and Calabria is told by an eye-witness of its 
disastrous effects and an active worker for the relief 
of its victims, in an attractive volume entitled 
Sicily in Shadow and in Sun " ( Little, Brown, & 
Co.) by that always delightful chronicler of tilings 
Italian, Mrs. Maud Howe Elliott. As Secretary of 
the Ladies' Auxiliary of the American Relief Com- 
mittee, Mrs. Elliott had the best of op]x>rtunities to 
study the relief work from first to last; and Mr. 
Elliott, who was with her, made drawings and took 
photographs of the memorable scenes, whereby the 
book is very greatly enriched. As usual with her. 
the author has made her book invitingly conversa- 
tional and first-personal in its tone. Even the hor- 
rors of the earthquake receive a welcome softening 
from the charm of the manner in which they are 
related. But there are other things to claim one's 
attention besides the sufferings of the stricken dis- 
trict. Chapters on Palermo, Taormina, Syracuse, 
and on the building of the new Messina, with pas- 
sing glimpses of famous visitors to the relief cam]). 
diversify and enliven the narrative. The book, like 
its companion volumes from the same pen, is printed 
in the clearest of type and attractively bound, while 
in wealth and variety of illustrations it probably 
surpasses them. 

Conspicuously excellent by reason of its half- 
hundred photogravure plates, printed in soft and 
pleasing tints, is Mr. Joel Cook's handsome two- 
volume work on "The Mediterranean and its 
Borderlands " ( Winston). The method of treatment 
is descriptive and historical, the western shores and 
islands of the Mediterranean being taken up first, 
and the older lands of the Levant reserved for the 
latter part of the work. The recent large increase 
of travel, especially in the winter, to the sunny 
shores of the greatest of inland seas makes timely 
and useful this attractive guide-book, which is of 
course indexed and otherwise arranged to facilitate 
reference. Among subjects of modern interest in 
these pages so largely devoted to old-world topics, 
occurs a description of the great Assouan Dam, 
which began its beneficent work of irrigation only 
a few yean ago. A good map of the regions de-

scribed would not have come amiss, but none is to 
be found in the book. Ornate gilt binding, out- 
side cloth wrappers, and a box of the same material, 
contribute to the beauty and durability of the vol- 
umes. 

A volume compactly printed and full of informa- 
tion acceptable to the tourist, as also to the stay-at- 
home reader, comes from the Macmillan Co. in 
Mr. Edward Hutton's " Siena and Southern 
Tuscany." Having already written a book on " The 
Cities of Umbria," the author is sufficiently familiar 
with and sufficiently in love with this section of 
Italy to write enthusiastically and with much first- 
hand information. Rather whimsically, however, 
he insists on the superiority of the old mediaeval 
highway, the Via Francigena, as the one proper 
route to follow in journeying through Southern 
Tuscany, partly because it was the way of the 
Franks into Italy and the road our ancestors followed 
in visiting Rome. The exact route signifies little, 
so one gets a view of all that is worth seeing ; and 
much of this is embraced in Mr. Hutton's book, 
which is made additionally attractive by the twenty- 
eight illustrations it contains, sixteen of them being 
beautiful colored views executed by Mr. O. F. M. 
Ward. After Siena, the reader is conducted to 
Asciano, Rapoland, Serre, Lucignano, Sinalunga, 
Montepulciano, Arezzo, and many other places of 
interest. 

Poetry and charm would not be looked for by 
many in the mud of the Missouri River. Neverthe- 
less Mr. John G. Neihardt, the Nebraska poet, has 
found inspiration in that turbid flood of waters for 
his volume of romance from real life, " The River 
and I" (Putnam). From Benton, in Montana, at 
the head of Missouri River navigation, to Sioux City 
in Iowa he and two companions made their leisurely 
way by row-boat, meeting with divers adventures 
and enjoying every mile of the journey, so far as 
head winds and other unavoidable adverse condi- 
tions would allow. On reaching his destination the 
author confesses that he has never felt at home in 
a town. "Towns, after all, are machines to facil- 
itate getting psychically lost," he declares. Asked 
at the outset what he expected to find on his journey, 
the poet-philosopher replied briefly : " Some more 
of myself." Fifty illustrations from photographs 
that appear to have been taken on the way appro- 
priately accompany the reading matter. The book 
is one to give the conventionalized city-dweller a 
wholesome jolt. 

Others beside the doughty Colonel have hunted 
big game in Africa, and have written about it, too. 
Among these author-huntsmen Mr. John T. Mc- 
Cutcheon deserves commendatory notice, the more 
so that he is not only a lion-killer and an agreeable 
writer, but also able to illustrate with his pencil the 
thrilling adventures chronicled by his pen, being 
indeed well known as cartoonist of the Chicago 
" Tribune." " In Africa : Hunting Adventures in 
the Big Game Country " (Bobbs-Merrill) is a book 
about as large as Mr. Roosevelt's similar volume, and 



describes events that took place at about the same 
time as those that form the subject of "African 
Game Trails." In fact, the two American hunters 
met, and not the least interesting portion of Mr. 
McCutcheon's book is that relating the interchange 
of courtesies and stories between them. It was an 
expedition organized by Mr. Akeley, the famous 
African hunter, that Mr. McCutcheon joined, and its 
experience was an eventful one. Numerous draw- 
ings, frequently humorous, are sprinkled through 
the book, which is further illustrated from many 
photographs. 

No hasty impressions are recorded in Miss Irene 
A. Wright's "Cuba" (Macmillan), but rather the 
matured opinions and convictions of a ten years' 
residence (somewhat interrupted) oh the island, 
" the last four of which have been spent largely in 
travelling hither and yon through its provinces, on 
work entailed first by connections with local news- 
papers, next by an appointment as special agent of 
the Cuban department of agriculture, and, finally, 
by the business of editing a monthly magazine 
which describes the island principally from agricul- 
tural and industrial points of view." These words 
indicate fairly well the author's point of view in the 
present work, although her book is rich in miscel- 
laneous information and incidents of personal ex- 
perience. In a chapter entitled " ' Cuba Libre ' a 
Farce," as occasionally elsewhere in the volume, she 
does not hesitate to draw aside the veil covering the 
sordidness and selfishness of many of the motives 
actuating our late intercession and our inglorious 
war with Spain. Half-tone plates are lavishly used 
in illustrating the book, which runs to the length of 
five hundred pages. 

In a series of nineteen day-excursions about Lon- 
don, Miss Aida Rodman de Milt (or De Milt, 
whichever she prefers) saw so much that is worth 
seeing, and that the visitor to London often omits, 
that she has prepared an inviting volume, " Ways 
and Days out of London" (Baker & Taylor Co.), 
fully illustrated with the aid of a camera, describing 
and depicting the views, the buildings, the incidents, 
and the people that made those nineteen days so 
memorable to her and to her tourist companions, 
Sonia and Diana. Among the places thus easily 
and quickly accessible from London are Hampton 
Court, Ascot, Rochester, Richmond, Ely, Maiden- 
head, Epping Forest, Dulwich, St. Albans, Canter- 
bury, and Cambridge. But Oxford we do not find 
on her list, rather strangely. The light and breezy 
style in which the author has endeavored to present 
these holiday-makings is indicated by the remark 
of an aged guide at Harbledown : "I like to show 
the church to American ladies. They always say 
something to make you laugh ; and we might as 
well laugh whenever we can, you know." The 
sixty-six pictures in the book greatly stimulate the 
interest. 

In an unfrequented spot in the Bernese Alps, in 
a mountain chalet which she christens " Chalet 
Edelweiss," about a mile and a half from the 



THE DIAL 



[Dec. 16, 



Grindelwald station on the road to the Upper 
Glacier, Mrs. Edith Elmer Wood and her family 
minus its head, who is a naval officer and had been 
ordered to the Philippines passed a recent sum- 
mer of Arcadian peace and happiness and simplicity ; 
and she now chronicles the blissful experience in 
engaging fashion, with plentiful illustrations of 
Swiss scenery, in a book entitled " An Oberland 
Chalet," published by Weasels & Bissell Co. Walking 
excursions and other innocent and healthful recrea- 
tions helped to occupy the time, and as the scenes 
and characters described are not those familiar 
to the tourist, the narrative successfully avoids 
the Nth repetition of the Utterly Familiar." Mrs. 
Wood's style has the sparkle of wit and merriment 
and high spirits, and her book has a wholesome 
and tonic effect. Artistically bound and boxed, it 
is also a pleasure to the eye. 

The comparatively unknown interior of Sicily, 
with its survivals of ancient customs and supersti- 
tions, is entertainingly treated in Miss Louise 
Caico's "Sicilian Ways and Days" (Appleton). In 
the province of Caltanissetta, the only Sicilian prov- 
ince with no sea-coast, the author was long a so- 
journer, mingling familiarly with the natives and 
snap-shotting them and the scenes amid which they 
live. From these numerous photographs, taken 
with a small camera, and in no expectation of ever 
publishing any of them, a large number have been 
selected for the illustration af the photographer's 
book, being arranged two on a page and showing an 
unexpected clearness of detail. Even the surfeited 
reader of travels will find novelty and piquancy in 
Miss Caico's pages. In gaining the confidence and 
friendship of the inland Sicilians, who are by nature 
secretive and disposed to suspect the visiting stranger, 
she has been fortunate, and her readers will profit 
by her ability to draw the curtain from before much 
that usually remains hidden to the conventional 
traveller. 

Dr. Charles W. Townsend's " A Labrador Spring " 
(Estes) is a tale of ornithological travel and adven- 
ture along northern shores. The author is evidently 
a naturalist, but not of the closest type. He is a 
lover of the out-of-doors, and writes a pleasing narra- 
tive of the cruise of " La Belle Marguerite " from 
the Acadian village to the summer homes of the 
Montagnais Indians. The book is replete with ob- 
servations on the peculiar flora, the birds and other 
denizens of these bleak shores. The author is also 
a student of human nature, and his accounts of his 
northern friends, both Indian and white, are enter- 
taining. The book is beautifully and abundantly 
illustrated, and gives on the whole a very satisfactory 
glimpse into this little-known and inhospitable land. 

A narrative of personal experience among the 
leaders of thought and action in Norway is to be 
found in Martha Buckingham Wood's A Trip to 
the Land of the Midnight Sun " (Brando's ), a series 
of brief chapters devoted to a wide range of Nor- 
wegian topics. The writer's discourse is mainly of 
persons, interspersed with casual references to the 



physiographic, climatic, and social conditions of this 
the most truly democratic nation of Europe. The 
intense and serious intellectual activity of this sturdy 
people is revealed in the author's converse with one 
and another. Their well-founded pride in their 
authors, musicians, and artists, and the large share 
which women take not only in the political but in 
the intellectual life of the people, is often revealed 
by the passing comment. 

HOLIDAY ART BOOKS. 

Two large, handsomely printed, and fully illn-- 
trated volumes are added to the " Classics of Art " 
series (Scribner). The pathetic story of that artistic 
genius who worked his way up from obscurity and 
poverty to the high level of Reynolds and Gains- 
borough in the patronage of fashionable London and 
in the judgment of connoisseurs is again told, and 
well told, in Mr. Arthur B. Chamberlain's " George 
Romney." His life is related in Part I.; "The 
Man and his Methods" is the heading to Part II.; 
and "His Art" is considered in Part III. More 
than seventy plates, including one of Romney as 
painted by himself, and including also, of course, 
a number of Lady Hamilton's portraits in various 
characters, are given as examples of the artist's 
style. Bibliography, appended details, and copious 
index are duly provided, and the whole work, for 
which the public appetite has been whetted by Mrs. 
Ward's " Fenwick's Career," should meet with a 
cordial reception. In Mr. A. J. Finberg's "Turner's 
Sketches and Drawings " is presented a well- 
systematized and, in general, a chronological study 
of Turner's art as illustrated by those twenty thous- 
and and more preliminary sketches with which his 
death enriched the National Gallery. The collection 
Mr. Finberg has found to be "of very great psy- 
chological interest. It shows clearly upon what 
basis of immediately presentative elements the airy 
splendour of Turner's richly imaginative art was 
built : and amongst the twenty odd thousand sheets 
of drawings in all stages of elaboration, the embry- 
onic forms of most of the painter's masterpieces can 
be easily traced." One hundred plates, including 
a colored frontispiece, show these initial conceptions 
of the artist in various stages of completion. Of 
psychologic and also of more general human inter- 
est to the average reader, the book is sure to appeal 
strongly to the artist and the artrlover. 

" French Portrait Engraving of the XVIIth and 
XVIIIth Centuries " (Bell-Macmillan) is a detailed 
and more or less technical account of that branch of 
art, from Claude Mellan of the early seventeenth to 
Janinet and others of the late eighteenth century, 
with some notice of MeUan's predecessor* and a 
preliminary chapter on the general characteristics 
of the French school. The author, Mr. T. H. 
Thomas, says of this school that it " had no inde- 
pendent existence before 1625, and it was brought 
to an end by the Revolution ; since then the por- 
traits engraved in France have either been academic 
imitations of the old work, or else in a wholly differ-

ent manner." Thirty-nine excellent reproductions 
of noteworthy engravings illustrate and explain the 
writer's criticisms and comments, which are grouped 
under three main divisions, " The Seventeenth 
Century," "The Louis XV. Period," and "The 
Louis XVI. Period." The book closes with a com- 
mendably full list of French portrait engravers of 
the two centuries under discussion, the list includ- 
ing the chief foreign engravers who adopted the 
French method and style. Mr. Thomas has sought 
to fill a gap in art history, and it is safe to say 
that no such careful and critical and reasonably 
exhaustive treatment of the subject has before 
appeared. 

Napoleonic literature, vast though it is, has hith- 
erto contained no work treating fully that blithesome 
branch of art called caricature as applied to the 
world-familiar form and features of the Little Cor- 
poral. This lack is now abundantly supplied by 
the two ample volumes of Mr. A. M. Broadley's 
" Napoleon in Caricature" (Lane), to which Mr. J. 
Holland Rose contributes an adequate " Introductory 
Essay on Pictorial Satire as a Factor in Napoleonic 
History." Both men have already written learnedly 
and at length about Napoleon, and they enter upon 
their present task well equipped. The first volume 
is devoted to English caricature of Britain's hated 
foe, while the second takes up French, German, 
Italian, Spanish, Russian, Dutch, Swiss, and Scandi- 
navian caricature. American caricature of Napoleon 
seems not to have claimed the author's attention. 
Nearly two hundred and fifty illustrations, of which 
twenty-four are colored, present the more interesting 
specimens of Napoleonic caricature and the portraits 
of some of the more eminent caricaturists. Mr. 
Broadley has done his work well, and, we should 
say, has done it for all time. 

Miss Elisabeth McClellan, whose long superin- 
tendence, at the Philadelphia Library, of that de- 
partment of literature which treats of the history of 
costume has made her a trustworthy authority on 
the subject, supplements her " Historic Dress in 
America, 1607-1800 " with a companion volume, 
"Historic Dress in America, 1800-1870," both 
handsomely produced by Messrs. George W. Jacobs 
& Co. As is said in the prefatory note to the latter 
work, "many books have been written on the 
houses, the furniture, and the decorations of the 
century we have so lately seen pass into history, but 
of the costumes chosen and worn by our immediate 
ancestors very little -has been recorded in print." 
Naturally it is the dress of women that occupies by 
far the larger portion of Miss McClellan's book. 
The quarto size of its pages affords space for group- 
ing the costumes of a period in a striking and 
extremely interesting manner. From old-time wear- 
ing apparel, from nineteenth-century photographs 
and prints, from paintings, and from other trust- 
worthy sources the large number of illustrations 
have been drawn. There are some in pen-and-ink 
and some in half-tone, Miss Sophie B. Steel and 
Mr. Cecil W. Trout being the artists. The de- 



scriptive matter shows careful study of a large 
number of authorities, a list of which and an index 
and a glossary close the book. 

Mr. Charles H. Caffin, who writes on art in a 
way so intelligible and so interesting even to those 
who are neither artists nor very highly educated in 
art history and criticism, has issued another of his 
popular manuals on painting. This time it is " The 
Story of Spanish Painting " ( Century Co.) that he 
has chosen to tell, in much the same manner as his 
" Story of Dutch Painting." A preliminary chapter 
on " The Story of the Nation " presents the physical 
environment of Spanish art, and is followed by use- 
ful chapters on the characteristics of that art and a 
panoramic view of its development to the opening 
of the nineteenth century. The succeeding chapters 
are devoted to a few of Spain's greatest painters, 
from " El Greco " in the sixteenth century to Goya, 
who died in 1828. A " Postscript " pays brief 
attention to Fortuny, Pradilla, Zuloaga, and a few 
others of our own time. Thirty-three full-page 
plates convey such hints of the merits of the masters 
discussed as can be given in the black-and-white of 
half-tone reproductions. 

HOLIDAY BIOGRAPHIES AND MEMOIRS. 

A considerable number of entertaining episodes 
from real life are brought together in a large and 
handsome volume entitled " The Rose Goddess, and 
Other Sketches of Mystery and Romance " (Long- 
mans), enriched with a profusion of portraits and 
other illustrations. Lady Constance Russell, ex- 
perienced narrator of such tales of romance (see 
her " Three Generations of Fascinating Women " 
and her " Swallowfield and its Owners "), is 
the author of the book. Each of its component 
sketches, she says, introduces one or more charac- 
ters nearly or remotely connected with her family, 
so that, although several of them are old stories re- 
told, she has been able to add, from private sources, 
some new and intimate details. These sources she 
seldom distracts the reader by naming. Never 
allowing a good story to be spoiled in the telling, 
she carries her willing listeners swiftly and agree- 
ably along, from the romance of the " Rose 
Goddess " (Kitty Kirkpatrick, Carlyle's supposed 
first love, concerning whose history in more detail 
the student should consult Mr. Raymond C. Archi- 
bald's book of a year ago) through the fortunes of 
Louise de KeVoualle and some of her descendants, 
the marriage of Lady Elizabeth Keppel to Lord 
Tavistock, and what came of it, the strange dis- 
appearance of Benjamin Bathurst, of the British 
diplomatic service, the history of Sarah, Marchioness 
of Exeter, and other diverting narratives. Appended 
matter, including notes and a genealogical chart 
giving Louise de KeVoualle's pedigree, and an index 
close the book. Of the numerous pictures, twenty- 
eight are collotype plates, and the remaining twenty- 
two half-tone prints. 

From a new and rather surprising point of view 
Mr. W. R. H. Trowbridge contemplates the char- 



THE DIAL 



[Der. !;, 



acter and deeds of that mighty magician, Count 
Cagliostro, in his book entitled "Cagliostro: The 
Splendour and Misery of a Master of Magic " 
(Dutton). Entering upon his work with never a 
doubt that this famous wonder-worker was the arch- 
impostor he is generally supposed to have been, 
Mr. Trowbridge was " astonished to find how little 
foundation there was in point of fact for the popular 
conception." Accordingly his conscientious study of 
the man is no parrot-like repetition of the familiar 
tale of his alleged impostures ; but whether he suc- 
ceeds in his attempt " to correct and revise ... a 
false judment of history," we will not, off-hand, 
undertake to say. The reader will enjoy deter- 
mining for himself what degree of success has been 
gained in this rather formidable, if not hopeless, 
enterprise. At any rate, the book is unique among 
the many accounts that have been written of the 
famous charlatan, as he will still continue to be 
called. Illustrations, chiefly portraits, are abund- 
antly supplied to heighten the attraction of this 
undeniably attractive book. 

Women's looks were Byron's books, and folly 
was all they taught him. That, in brief, is the 
lesson of Mr. Francis Cribble's extended work of 
nearly four hundred pages on "The Love Affairs 
of Lord Byron" (Scribner). The poet's whole 
life, observes the author, " was deflected from its 
course and thrown out of gear : first, by his un- 
happy passion for Mary Chaworth ; secondly, by 
the way in which women of all ranks, flattering his 
vanity for the gratification of their own, importuned 
him with the offer of their hearts." But in regard- 
ing Byron's love affairs as " the principal incidents 
of his life, and almost the only ones," Mr. Gribble 
goes a little too far. Byron had his friendships, as 
well as his loves, he had his literary projects and 
ambitions, and also his literary squabbles, and he 
had a most real and active interest in Greek inde- 
pendence. Still, a life of Byron with chief refer- 
ence to his affairs of the heart is the kind of biog- 
raphy to appeal successfully to the public, and it is 
the sort of work Mr. Gribble has before now engaged 
in to the satisfaction of his readers. The present 
volume is provided with portraits, and is printed in 
Urge, clear type, with division into short and invit- 
ing chapters. 

Biography somewhat after the fashion of Miss 
Muhlbach is presented in Miss Marie Hay's generous 
volume entitled "The Winter Queen: Being the 
Unhappy History of Elizabeth Stuart, Electress 
Palatine, Queen of Bohemia " (Houghton). Both 
title-page and preface frankly proclaim the book to 
be a romance; but as the author prepared herself 
by special study and a special journey to Prague 
before putting pen to paper, and as her hand is by 
no means new to this sort of writing, her work 
merits respectful attention. Her heroine, the con- 
sort of Frederick V. who reigned in Bohemia just 
one winter (1619-20), is truly a romantic character 
as portrayed in Miss Hay's pages. The Stuart 
charm has taken possession of the author, and t la- 



reader is exposed to the risk of falling a victim to 
the same fascination. The moderate length of tin- 
chapters, the sufficiency of brisk conversation, the 
rapid succession of events, and the interspersed 
portraits of the chief characters, certainly give t la- 
book an inviting appearance. 

Lady Dorothy Nevill has followed up her chatty 
" Reminiscences," of four years ago, with another 
volume of like anecdotal and retrospective character. 
" Under Five Reigns" (Lane), completed last sum- 
mer and edited by her son, was prompted by 1 1 it- 
fact that, as the writer says, she has come across 
further notes and letters connected with the social 
life of the Victorian and Edwardian eras, a number 
of which it seemed to her might not prove unacct-|>: 
able to her friendly readers. Born in the reign of 
" the first gentleman of Europe," Lady Dorothy has 
witnessed the accession of four succeeding monarch- 
to the throne of England. Given a good memory 
and a ready pen, a life of that length, lived in 
society, affords material for much enlivening reminis- 
cence ; and the author has not been blind to her 
opportunity. The pictures in the book include, be- 
side numerous portraits, three pages of amusing 
sketches from the pen of Richard Doyle, one of 
whose letters in fascimile is also given. The lunik 
is a treasury of memories of auld lang syne. 

Mr. Frank Hamel, whose studies and previou- 
writings qualify him to speak umlerstandingly on 
the subject, has prepared a volume on " The 
Dauphines of France " (Pott). "In gathering into 
one volume," he says in his preface, "the biogra- 
phies of fifteen princesses, some familiar, others 
as yet Very little known to English readers, it has 
been obviously impossible to give an exhaustive 
history of each, but I have aimed at producing in 
every case a finished study of life and character." 
From Jeanne de Bourbon in the fourteenth century 
to Marie-The'rese in the nineteenth, this portrait 
gallery of women who had fame thrust upon them 
exhibits a succession of characters that compel one's 
interest if only by reason of the scenes and events 
amidst which they lived. Nor are fascinating per- 
sonalities lacking among them, as, for instance, 
Mary Stuart, Marie- Adelaide de Savoie, and Marie- 
Antoinette. Of course the book is not deficient in 
portraits of these dauphines, nor is it without its 
full and useful index. It also contains, in its open- 
ing pages, what the author believes to be the first 
account in English of the position of the dauphine at 
the French court and of the ceremonial which sur- 
rounded those in the direct line of succession to the 
throne of France." 

A history of fops and foppery has been zealously 
undertaken and elaborately executed by Miws Clare 
Jerrold in a good-sized octavo volume entitled "The 
Beaux and the Dandies" (Lane). James Ha\. 
Earl of Carlisle, is the first of a long succession of 
magnificent leaders of fashion whom the author 
makes to strut and smile and ogle for our benefit, 
and Count d'Orsay, more than two centuries later, 
is the last of this brave company to be met with in 



1910.]

her amusing pages. Beau Nash of course figures 
prominently in those pages. Chesterfield, George 
Selwyn, Charles James Fox, King George the 
Fourth, and the Duke of Wellington appear also 
among those more or less addicted to foppery. 
Seventeen well-chosen pictures help the reader to a 
better acquaintance with all these delectible dandies. 
An index concludes the hook, but there is neither 
annotation nor bibliography to temper with too great 
seriousness the gaiety of its sprightly chapters. 

HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE. 

In no more inviting and beautiful form has Miss 
Mitford's " Our Village " ever appeared than in the 
large octavo, clearly-printed, wide-margined, appro- 
priately and profusely illustrated edition now issued 
by the Macmillan Company, with an extended 
Introduction by Mrs. Anne Thackeray Ritchie. 
" For people who are beginning to remember, rather 
than looking forward any more," she says, "there 
certainly exists no more delightful reading than the 
memoirs and stories of heroes and heroines, many 
of whom we ourselves may have seen, and to whom 
we may have spoken." If not Miss Mitford's actual 
characters, we have all seen persons answering well 
some of her graphic descriptions. No sketches in 
all English literature are more wholesomely engag- 
ing, in their quiet way, than Miss Mitford's. The 
sixteen colored plates provided by Mr. Alfred 
Rawlings for this edition breathe the very air of 
" Our Village "; but not less pleasing, and even 
more gracefully delicate and beautiful, are the one 
hundred line drawings executed by Mr. Hugh 
Thomson. 

No play of Shakespeare's bears repeated re- 
reading better than " Hamlet," and even though one 
may know it almost by heart it will be most agree- 
able to read the familiar drama once more in the 
sumptuous new edition illustrated by Mr. W. G. 
Simonds and provided with a detailed synopsis or 
paraphrase of the play and an account of its origin 
by Sir Arthur T. Quiller-Couch. The latter writer 
takes occasion to express his disbelief in Hamlet's 
madness. The text of the Oxford edition has 
been followed, and notes are conspicuously absent. 
Nothing but the frequent highly-colored pictures 
will distract the reader's attention, and these well- 
conceived and not too realistic illustrations will 
hardly be complained of as an unwelcome distrac- 
tion. They are thirty in number, loosely mounted 
on heavy inserts. The volume in its style and size 
is suited to the table, not to the unsupported hand. 
(Hodder & Stoughton.) 

"The History of a Conscript of 1813," which 
many readers will remember, with affection or the 
reverse, as having been imposed upon them at school 
as compulsory French reading, appears in an ex- 
cellently printed and generously illustrated edition 
(Macmillan). Text illustrations are interspersed 
with colored drawings, not so artistically excellent 
as to distract the reader's attention from the story ; 
and of the translation we are told in a prefatory 



note that it " is based on that issued by Mr. John 
Camden Hotten, about 1871," but that it has been 
compared with " an early French edition, and thus 
numerous verbal errors and inaccuracies have been 
corrected." The same note gives a brief sketch of 
the joint authors of the story, Emile Erckmann and 
Alexandre Chatrian. As a handy, clearly printed, 
and inexpensive edition of this famous historical 
romance, the book merits hearty commendation. 

Mr. Arthur Rackham finds inspiration for his 
annual holiday volume in Wagner's " Nibelung's 
Ring." The cycle is to be completed in two 
volumes, the one now ready containing " The 
Rhinegold and the Valkyrie," the text newly trans- 
lated into English by Miss Margaret Armour. The 
new book is similar in size and make-up to Mr. 
Rackham's other notable volumes ; the illustrations 
are as usual printed in colors and separately mounted 
on tinted sheets. Mr. Rackham touches nothing 
that he does not adorn, and his "Ring" pictures 
are full of imagination, quaintly humorous, mysti- 
cal, suggesting in sweep of line the colossal grandeur 
of the theme. In comparison with his earlier work, 
however, they lack a certain spontaneity and a 
delicacy of fancy that has been one of the artist's 
chief charms ; the freshness of genuine inspiration is 
not upon many of them. (Doubleday, Page & Co.) 

A serviceable, well-illustrated, sufficiently-anno- 
tated, and inexpensive edition of Goldsmith's poems, 
with a biographical and critical introduction by Mr. 
Horatio Sheafe Krans, is published by the Messrs. 
Putnam. Nine pictures in photogravure, from 
original designs by Mr. Frederick Simpson Coburn, 
help to interpret the poet, several of them being 
views executed at Lissoy, the " sweet Auburn " of 
"The Deserted Village." The biographical intro- 
duction, filling seventy-six pages, gives in agreeable 
and handy form the main facts concerning Gold- 
smith's life and writings, with eulogistic comment 
on the poems. Dr. Krans is in love with his theme, 
and it will not be his fault if the reader fails to 
conceive a new affection for this most amiable of 
British poets. 

The immortal love-story of " Aucassin and Nicol- 
ette," that perpetual challenge to the dexterous 
translator, has tempted Mr. Eugene Mason to essay 
another version. A comparison with the original 
shows his rendering to be free, but in admirable 
harmony with the spirit of the romance, and his 
paraphrases of the metrical portions to be in the 
metre of the French, and, in every case, nearly or 
exactly of the same length as the original. The 
typography and decoration of the book, including 
six fanciful colored illustrations by Mr. Maxwell 
Armfield, are tasteful. A more agreeable English 
dress to this old French classic could not reasonably 
be desired. (E. P. Dutton & Co. ) 

A limited edition of Gray's "Elegy," hand 
lettered, printed on Italian hand-made paper, sewed 
by hand with silk, and with a hand-colored frontis- 
piece and initial letter, is issued by Mr. F. J. Trezise 
of Chicago. A decorative border encloses each page

of text, and the printing is on one side only of the 
paper, which is folded, however, so as to give the 
book no unusual appearance on opening it. The 
total effect is distinctly artistic and pleasing. Two 
hundred copies have been printed. 

HOLIDAY FICTION. 

Rural scenes and strongly marked rural char- 
acters form the staple of Mr. Frank Waller Allen's 
The Golden Road" (Weasels & Bissell Co.) which 
is rendered especially attractive to the eye by Mr. 
George Hood's tinted decorations and excellent 
illustrations. " Oldmeadow," a Kentucky village 
on the Ohio, is the scene of the story, and Jean 
Francois, " the Happy Pedler," and poet as well as 
pedler and umbrella-mender, is one of the chief 
dramatis personce. Others are old Dr. Felix Long- 
street, " always smelling delightfully of a mixture 
of strong tobacco smoke and carbolic acid," Monsieur 
1'Abbl Jacques Picot, Nance Gwyn, and Charles 
Reubelt King, the narrator. As a quiet bit of 
character-study and deft character-drawing the book 
is very pleasing, and does credit to Mr. Allen. 

As usual, a number of short stories have this 
year been published in form suitable to the gift 
season. Mrs. Margaret Deland's "The Way to 
Peace " ( Harper) is a sweet but over-tragic tale of 
a Shaker settlement Illustrations by Mrs. Alice 
Barber Stephens and decorative page borders lend 
it a holiday air. "A Christmas Mystery: The 
Story of Three Wise Men " ( Lane), by Mr. William 
J. Locke, is a powerfully related episode in the life 
of three eminent Londoners. As a magazine story 
it attracted much attention ; in a prettily decorated 
booklet it is sure to prove a popular gift Poetic, 
delicate, little sketches, often allegorical in form, 
are Mr. Emerson Hough's "The Singing Mouse 
Stories" (Bobbs-Merrill Co.). They suggest the 
subtle joys that lie behind the commonplaces of life, 
particularly the charm of childhood memories and 
of nature. The decorations are vague and shadowy, 
in keeping with the elusive character of the Singing 
Mouse. "The Unlived Life of Little Mary Ellen" 
is the title of Mrs. Ruth McEnery Stuart's new 
Simkinsville story, which is prettily decorated in 
tint by Miss Ruth Clements. (Bobbs-Merrill Co). 
In "Everybody's Lonesome" (Revell) Miss 
Clara Laughlin tells a - true fairy story " with a 
moral for all discontented people. There are illus- 
trations by Mr. A. I. Keller. "On Christmas 
Day in the Evening," by Miss Grace Richmond, is 
a companion volume to the same author's "On 
Christmas Day in the Morning." There are 
illustrations in color, and borders of holly leaves. 
(Doubleday Page & Co). "A Chariot of Fire," 
by Mrs. Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, is a tale of true 
neighborliness between rich and poor folk; and the 
rich are left debtors to the poor. (Harper & Bros.). 
One of the most popular chapters in that popular 
volume, "Aunt Jane of Kentucky," was "Sally 
Ann's Experience," which is now published by itself, 
with a gay cover, frontispiece, and borders in color. 



and an introduction by Mrs. Hall, telling why she 
wrote the story. (Little, Brown & Co.). An 
absurd bit of fooling by the late " O. Henry " is 
published in an illustrated booklet by Messrs. 
Doubleday, Page & Co. Its title, "Let Me Feel 
Your Pulse : Adventures in Neurasthenia," suffici- 
ently suggests its theme. 

MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS. 

We can hardly have too many books about 
Hawthorne. To the large number already existing 
Miss Helen Archibald Clarke adds one on " Haw- 
thorne's Country " (Baker & Taylor Co.), similar 
in character to her " Longfellow's Country," 
' Browning's England," and " Browning's Italy," 
of previous seasons. Her purpose in the present 
volume is " to show more explicitly than has hereto- 
fore been shown the relation between his [Haw- 
thorne's] life experiences and his work, and to 
illustrate as completely as possible in the space of 
one volume the general trend of his genius and the 
culmination of its various phases." Accordingly the 
different sections of New England that he became 
familiar with, and also something of the England 
and the Italy of his European days, are successively 
treated, with a natural emphasis on the relation 
between his environment and the products of his 
genius. Whether or not that environment was of 
so great moment to one of Hawthorne's introverted 
nature, may remain an open question ; but the story 
of his successive " life experiences " is of per- 
ennial interest, and the publishers have given of 
their best, in clear type, handsome binding, and 
numerous illustrations, (the latter including many 
views of old buildings from early prints), to make 
Miss Clarke's well-written book appeal successfully 
to a discriminating taste. 

Originality in conception and treatment is to be 
found in Mrs. Emily James Putnam's thoughtful, 
well-written, and sufficiently learned work on "The 
Lady : Studies of Certain Significant Phases of her 
History " (Sturgis & Walton Company). The book's 
purpose is "to suggest in outline the theories that 
various typical societies have entertained of the lady ; 
to note the changing ideals that she has from time 
to time proposed to herself ; to show in some meas- 
ure what her daily life has been like, what sort of 
education she has had, what sort of man she ha* 
preferred to marry ; in short, what manner of terms 
she has contrived to make with the very special con- 
ditions of her existence." The eight chapters into 
which it is divided take up, successively, the Greek 
lady, the Roman lady, the lady Abbess, the lady of 
the castle, the lady of the Renaissance, the lady of 
the salon, the blue-stocking lady, and the lady of 
the slave states. Available sources for illustrating 
such a book as Mrs. Putnam's are not lacking, and 
they have been freely drawn upon. With its richly 
decorated cover and fair, large print the volume is 
very inviting. 

Mr. Warwick Goble, whose colored illustrations 
for Kingsley's " Water Babies " will be remembered 



1910.]

as a pleasant feature of last year's holiday season, 
now reappears as the illustrator of a large octavo 
volume entitled " The Green Willow, and Other 
Japanese Fairy Tales " (Macmillan). The stories, 
thirty-eight in number, which make up the text have 
been gathered by Miss Grace James from various 
sources. " Some have been selected from the Ko- 
ji-ki, or Record of Ancient Matters, which contains 
the mythology of Japan. Many are told from 
memory, being relics of childish days, originally 
heard from the lips of a school-fellow or a nurse. 
Certain of them, again, form favorite subjects for 
representation upon the Japanese stage." Mr. 
Goble's forty delicately-colored illustrations are sur- 
prisingly successful in reproducing the native atmo- 
sphere of the tales, and altogether the volume is one 
of the most charming and unusual of the season's 
offerings. 

The steam-ship, no less than the sailing vessel, 
is a thing of beauty and of power. The history of 
this marvellous product of many inventive brains is 
fully related in Mr. R. A. Fletcher's " Steam-Ships : 
The Story of their Development to the present 
Day " (Lippincott), uniform in style with Mr. E. 
Keble Chatterton's " Sailing Ships and their Story." 
Not only is the evolution of the modern ocean grey- 
hound traced from the first rude constructions of 
Rumsey and Fitch and Stevens and Fulton, but the 
author even goes back to such vague mention of ox- 
driven or man-driven paddle-wheel craft as is to be 
found in early literature. One hundred and fifty 
illustrations are provided, including views of mach- 
inery and of vessels in process of building, and the 
descriptive matter will interest both the naval archi- 
tect and the general reader. We look in vain among 
the pictures for the famous old stern-wheeler of 
the Mississippi River, and for the " Great Eastern." 
A model of the latter, however, is represented, 
and also an interesting contemporary caricature. 
Floating docks, the evolution of the battle steam- 
ship, the development of steam auxiliary, the turbine 
engine, and other related matters are adequately 
treated. 

The life of the lowly, sympathetically depicted, 
has far more of wholesome human interest than 
many a biography of the high and mighty. "A 
Shepherd's Life: Impressions of the South Wilt- 
shire Downs " (Dutton) has to do with the poor 
and obscure but on the whole contented and cheer- 
ful folk of pastoral England. Mr. W. H. Hudson 
is the author, and he has been ably seconded in his 
work by Mr. Bernard C. Gotch, the illustrator. 
One Caleb Bawcombe, South Wiltshire shepherd, is 
a prominent character in the rambling narrative, 
but there are others to divide the interest. Curious 
bits of natural-history lore from various sources 
enrich the chapters and prove the author to be 
intellectually acquisitive and also keenly observant. 
Among matters relating to sheep-culture we read 
with some surprise that sheep-bells in England are 
used chiefly if not solely because the shepherds, 
unprovided with the pastoral pipe of classic times, 



crave music of some sort, and get it in the tinkling 
of many bells, twenty-five or thirty to a flock. Mr. 
Gotch's many admirable line drawings, and his 
colored frontispiece view of Old Sarum, display 
much skill and taste. 

To those readers who find Gibbon's " Decline 
and Fall" too formidable to undertake, and even 
Signer Ferrero's far less ponderous works not suffi- 
ciently light, Mrs. Elisabeth W. Champney's " Ro- 
mance of Imperial Rome " (Putnam) is well calcu- 
lated to prove an acceptable presentation of some of 
the most interesting episodes in the history of the 
Eternal City. From the times of Augustus to the 
reign of Marcus Aurelius she conducts the reader 
through a succession of stirring scenes, making free 
use of anecdote and dialogue to enliven her pages, 
which are further diversified with numerous and 
excellent illustrations, partly in photogravure and 
partly in half-tone, reproducing both famous places 
and buildings of interest and also celebrated paint- 
ings having to do with Roman characters and events. 
The colored frontispiece, the ornamental binding, 
the large type and its open setting, the spacious 
margins, and, last but not least, the absence of index 
and notes, proclaim the book a source of enjoyment 
and diversion rather than a giver of historical in- 
formation and useful instruction. 

Mr. M. A. De Wolfe Howe's dignified and inter- 
esting volume on "Boston Common" (Riverside 
Press) will find a welcome far beyond the boundaries 
of that city. In four chapters he presents the 
memorable features and associations of the Common 
in the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, and 
twentieth centuries. The last, however, as being 
not yet in its 'teens, is dismissed with little ceremony 
and but a few remarks. Thirty-five excellent plates 
from sources more or less ancient adorn the book 
and greatly enhance its interest. Like the careful 
scholar that he is, Mr. Howe closes with a list of 
his "sources of information" and an index. The 
book, beside being well bound, is also boxed. The 
edition is limited to five hundred and fifty numbered 
copies. 

" Rumbo Rhymes, or The Great Combine " (Har- 
per), by Mr. Alfred C. Calmour, and " rendered 
into pictures " by Mr. Walter Crane, teaches, in a 
set of rollicking jingles, the wrongfulness of eating, 
beating, over-working, and otherwise oppressing 
our brothers and sisters of the brute creation. The 
book may fall considerably short of making all its 
readers vegetarians, but it is sure to amuse them 
if they be young in years, or in heart, or in both. 
The numerous animal pictures, all in a profusion of 
color, are in Mr. Crane's well-known style, and 
most happily match the rhymes in whimsical and 
good-natured absurdity. 

Marginal pictures in considerable variety, tinted 
and decorative in effect, as well as full-page colored 
illustrations, all from the practiced hand of Miss 
Sarah S. Stilwell, profusely adorn the new edition 
of Mr. Edward Sandford Martin's popular book, 
" The Luxury of Children, and Some Other Luxu-

riea" (Harper). These talks on domestic matters 
a subject on which we all feel qualified to express 
ourselves in agreement or disagreement with the 
author, especially if we chance to have no domestic 
life of our own as a disconcerting check to our 
abstract theories are of universal appeal, and they 
are now presented in a form that leaves nothing to 
be desired. 

Three successful books for the dweller in the 
open are reissued by the Outing Publishing Co. in 
uniform bindings of green limp leather and offered 
together in a neat cloth case as "The Robinson 
Crusoe Library." Mr. Horace Kephart's "Book 
of Camping and Woodcraft " and " Camp Cookery " 
and Dr. Charles Stuart Moody's " Backwoods Surg- 
ery and Medicine " are the three volumes comprising 
the set. Kurh is a practical and accredited manual, 
upon which the camper or woodsman may safely 
put reliance. A more acceptable gift for one who 
sojourns, either casually or habitually, out-of-doors 
will not be found among the season's publications. 

An appropriate and beautiful gift book for Christ- 
mas has been prepared by Miss Eleanor Hammond 
Broadns in her "Book of the Christ Child" 
(Appleton), which presents a number of the more 
important legends concerning the infant Jesus, 
simply and interestingly told, alternating with 
poetical selections from various sources, and abund- 
antly furnished with reproductions of famous paint- 
ings by the old masters. Both poems and pictures 
are in harmony with the book's purpose, which, the 
author explains, is " to present picturesque material 
which is comparatively unfamiliar in a Protestant 
country," and not "to give religious instruction." 
Old and young alike can find something to please 
them in the handsome volume. 

From a new publishing concern, The Abbey Com- 
pany of Chicago, comes a little group of choicely- 
printed booklets. Whittier's "Snowbound" is an 
addition to the " Abbey Classics," a series of English 
poems artistically printed on Japan vellum, with 

rubricated initials and photogravure portrait A 

beautiful Christmas story is to be found in the late 
Dr. Frederic Dewhurst's "The Magi in the West 
and their Search for the Christ" It relates how 
the Wise Men met again, this time to search for the 
kingdom of Christ on earth, and how at last they 
found it in the power of love. The third of the 
group is '* A German Christmas Eve," translated 
from the German of that popular humorist, Heinrich 
Seidel. The story, which is taken from his master- 
piece, " Leberecht Htihnchen," is a delightful picture 
of home life in Germany. The little book is printed 
in two colors, and daintily bound. 

The San Francisco publishing house of Messrs. 
Paul Elder & Co. maintains its enviable reputation 
as publishers of artistic and original holiday volumes. 
Their most attractive publication for this season is 
a limited edition of Mrs. Browning's " Sonnets from 
the Portuguese," printed in italic type on hand- 
made paper, and tastefully bound in boards, with 
decorated title label. A photogravure portrait and 



especially designed initial decorations coni]>ri-. 
the decorative features. Mr. Arthur Guitcnnan 
contributes a preface and notes. "The Book of 
Hospitalities" is an attractive guest book, with 
guest greetings in verse by Mr. Arthur Guilt-mum. 
who also contributes a " foreword " on " Old House 
Mottoes." Decorations in green on brown-toned 
Brittany paper and binding of brown boards with 
leather back are in the publishers' characteristic 
style. "The Complete Cynic," being " Bunches of 
Wisdom Culled from the Calendars of Oliver II. i - 
ford, Ethel Watts Muniford, and Addison Mizner," 
is a mirth-provoking collection of distorted proverbs 
with appropriate illustrations and decorations. 
"The College Freshman's Don't Book," by "G. F. 
E. (A. B. )," covers a multitude of college subject- 
from dress and dining to " things in general." Most 
of the advice is humorous and all of it is good. 
Patience and Her Garden," by Miss Ida Smith 
Decker, is "a whimsical parable for club-women, 
house-keepers," and other busy people. It is bound 
in paper, as is " Love and Friendship," a collection 
of epigrams by Miss Lillyan Shaffner. The " Im- 
pressions Calendar" for 1911 is composed of fifty- 
four sheets, each containing a motto beautifully 
decorated and illuminated. 

First place among the small anthologies of the sea- 
son belongs to Mr. Temple Scott's " The Christinas 
Treasury " (Baker & Taylor Co.). In outward 
form the volume is exactly uniform with the same 
compiler's collection entitled " In Praise of Gardens," 
published a few months ago ; and is edited with equal 
good judgment in the choice of material. The dec- 
orative cover, tinted end-leaves, and inviting typog- 
raphy are all in the best of taste. One of the most 
popular among year-books has been Mrs. Florence 
Hobart Perm's "The Optimist's Good-morning." 
To it she has now added a companion volume, " The 
Optimist's Good-night " (Little, Brown, & Co. ), full 
of tonic thoughts for the days of the year. Each 
page contains a helpful quotation and a prayer. 
"A Manual of Spiritual Fortification" (Harper) is 
a compilation by Mrs. Louise Collier Willcox, of 
"meditative and mystic poems" expressing "the 
abiding sense in man of- the indwelling God." 
Besides the intrinsic charm of the poems, the col- 
lection is interesting historically, as tracing the prog- 
ress of religious, as distinguished from doctrinal, 
feeling through the course of English poetry. 
Inspiring quotations from American and foreign 
authors have been gathered into an anthology by 
Mr. H. Wellington Wood, under the title, " Golden 
Words Fitly Spoken " (Lippincott). The extracts 
are printed in large type, in two colors, and portraits 
of a dozen or more of the authors represented serve 
as illustrations. "Songs of Sentiment " (Moffat, 
Yard & Co. ) is an anthology of love lyrics of all ages, 
printed with decorated page borders and illustrated 
in color by Mr. Howard Chandler Chri-ty. It is 
something of a shock to find Byron's "When We 
Two Parted " or Moore's " The Time I've Lost in 
Wooing " accompanied by pictures of typically u|>-

to-date Christy figures; but this will not disturb 
the artist's admirers, who are legion. "Through 
the Year with Sousa " (Crowell) consists of excerpts 
from the operas, marches, novels, letters, magazine 
articles, songs, sayings, and rhymes of the versatile 
and entertaining Mr. John Philip Sousa, selected 
by himself from the note-books kept through thirty 
busy years. Mrs. Grace Browne Strand has com- 
piled two companion anthologies, "Love, Friend- 
ship, and Good Cheer " and "Faith, Hope, Love." 
They are published in gay bindings, with novel 
decorations, by Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. 
" The Little Book of Friendship" (Reilly & Britton), 
compiled and edited by Wallace and Frances 
Rice, is a thin volume of treasure-trove, taste- 
fully bound in boards, with frontispiece in color. 
The little "Good-Luck Book," in an appropriate red 
leather cover, is a compilation of good wishes and 
cheerful verses compiled by Mr. Ole Bang and pub- 
lished by Brandu's. Miss Leolyn Louise Everett 
has collected, and the Watkins Co. of New York has 
published, the "Sleep Book," being selections from 
" The Poetry of Slumber." The volume is well 
printed on hand-made paper, in a limited edition. 

We can do little more than mention a number of 
small gift-books, whose range of interest is wide 
enough to include all imaginable minor holiday 
needs. " Cupid's Cyclopedia, compiled for Daniel 
Cupid ' ' by Messrs. Oliver Herford and John Cecil 
Clay (Scribner), is a worthy successor to "Cupid's 
Almanac." It defines for the earnest student of 
Love-making all the terms of the game, and depicts 
many intereresting varieties of the genus Lovely 
Woman, besides furnishing a map and a full de- 
scription of the " Ancient and Marvellous Countrie 
of Amoria." Mrs. Janet Ayer Fairbank is the 
author and Miss Rebecca Kruttschnitt is the illus- 
trator of "In Town, and Other Conversations" 
(McClurg), wherein are discussed, with more or less 
wit and wisdom, such matters as Debutantes, Bores, 
Playwriting, Woman and Superwoman, Success, 
and Civilization. "The Zodiac Birthday Book " 
(Baker & Taylor), by Miss Beatrice Baxter Ruyl, 
enables its reader to discover the whole truth about 
his own and his friends' characters. It is attractively 
printed in two colors, with blank pages under 
each sign for the insertion of names. In " The 
Teddy see " (Huebsch) , Mr. Wallace Irwin recounts 
in classic metres plentifully besprinkled with up- 
to-date slang the recent wanderings of the intrepid 
Colonel through Africa, Europe, and America. 
Appropriate illustrations by Mr. Blumenthal ac- 
company the text. Mr. H. C. Bunner's delightful 
operetta, "The Seven Old Ladies of Lavendar 
Town," with Mr. Oscar Weil's music, appears in a 
new illustrated edition bearing the imprint of 
Messrs. Harper & Brothers. Full of tender pathos 
is the plaint of "Caesar," the late King Edward's 
dog, entitled "Where's Master?" Who held 
Caesar's paw as he wrote the book has not been 
divulged, but it is evidently somebody who under- 
stands both dogs and men. " Mrs. Featherweight's 



Musical Moments," written and illustrated by Mr. 
John Brady, appears in a new edition, in board 
covers, from the press of the Alice Harriman Co. 
In spite of her excess of musical temperament, 
Mrs. Featherweight's monologues are full of human 
and humorous interest. " Siegfried," the third of 
the Ring cycle, has been translated into English 
verse by Dr. Oliver Huckel, as a companion volume 
to " The Rheingold ' ' and " The Valkyrie. ' ' There 
are four illustrations. (T. Y. Crowell & Co. ) In 
"The Great Moments in a Woman's Life," Miss 
Emily Calvin Blake sketches half a dozen episodes 
in the experience of a typical woman. They may be 
considered as a sort of sequel to her " Engaged Girl 
Sketches." (Forbes & Co.) Now that "Darius 
Green and his Flying Machine " has " come true," 
it is only fitting that Mr. Trowbridge's poem 
should appear in a new edition. Mr. Wallace 
Goldsmith furnishes a generous number of illus- 
trations. (Houghton Mifflin Co.) Mr. Thomas G. 
Thrum has selected a few tales from his book of 
Hawaiian legends, and Messrs. A. C. McClurg & 
Co. reprint them in a quaintly bound and decorated 
booklet entitled " Stories of the Menehunes." From 
the same publishers comes "Quercus Alba " by the 
late Will Lillibridge, a tale of a veteran oak of the 
Ozark Mountains. "The Master's Friendships" 
is a sermon by Dr. J. R. Miller, published with half 
a dozen illustrations in color and a pretty cover 
by Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co. An addition to 
Messrs. Duffield's " Rubric Series " reprints Oscar 
Wilde's "Ballad of Reading Gaol." "Brass Tacks: 
Capsule Optimism," by Colonel William C. Hunter, 
contains much epigrammatic wisdom making for 
courage, hope, and success. The cover is plenti- 
fully besprinkled with "tacks." (Reilly & Britton 
Co.) " My Advice Book " and "Making Faces " 
(McClurg) are pocket-sized opportunities for one's 
friends to develop latent humor. The small volumes, 
which are designed by Mr. Herschel Williams, are 
intended to be lent about among one's acquaintances, 
who are expected to fill them with good advice or 
good likenesses, as the case may be. Three pretty 
booklets in paper covers are Dr. William A. Quayle's 
interpretation of " The Song of Songs " (Jennings 
& Graham) ; Mr. Walter Taylor Field's discussion 
of "What is Success" (Pilgrim Press); and 
"Merry Xmas! " a two-scene farce on the overdoing 
of Christmas giving, by Miss Elizabeth Kellogg 
(Cincinnati: U. P. James). 



A TRANSLATION by Frances Douglas (Mrs. Charles 
F. Lummis), of Seuor Vinente Blasco Ibanez's story 
of bull-fighting, " Sangre y Arena," is announced by 
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co. for publication next Fall. 
Mrs. Lummis is an accomplished Spanish scholar, and 
her English rendering will have the approval of Senor 
Ibanez himself. The book will be illustrated in full 
color by Troy and Margaret West Kinney, who are 
spending the Winter in Spain partly to execute this im- 
portant commission.

NOTI->. 



The sixteenth annual meeting of the central division 
of the Modern Language Association of America will 
be held at Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri, 
on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, December 28, 
29, and 30. 

Dr. Sven Hedin's "Overland to India " will be issued 
by the Macmillan Co. within the next few weeks. It 
is supplementary to his " Trans-Himalaya," and de- 
scribes the overland journey to India by way of Teheran, 
made by the author before he started on his expedition 
to Tibet 

We are informed that an official biography of Thomas 
Love Peacock is being prepared. Any persons who 
have unpublished letters of Peacock in their possession 
are asked to communicate with his grand-daughter, 
Mrs. Charles Clarke, at 63, Kensington Mansions, Earl's 
Court, London, W. 

"The Oxford Book of Ballads," chosen and edited 
by Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch, is to be issued imme- 
diately by the Oxford University Press. This volume, 
consisting of nearly 900 pages, includes 176 ballads, a 
form of art, which, as the editor points out, has been 
dead, or as good as dead, for two hundred years. 

We learn from the London Nation " that Matilde 
Serao is engaged upon a novel, of which she is said to 
have greater hopes than of any she has yet written. Its 
theme resembles that of Flaubert's " Madame Bovary," 
and her original intention was to call the book " Sin." 
The author has, however, changed her mind, and the 
book will appear under the title of Intoxication, 
Slavery, and Death." 

A Memoir of the late John La Farge, with a study 
of his work, by Mr. Royal Cortissoz, is announced for 
publication next Spring by the Houghton Mifflin Co. 
Mr. Cortissoz, who is critic of art and literature of the 
"New York Tribune," and the author of important 
books upon art matters, has an intimate knowledge of 
Mr. La Farge and his work, based on a friendship of 
some twenty years. The book, which was sanctioned 
by Mr. La Farge, will embody recollections communi- 
cated by him to the author in manuscript, together with 
numerous notes of conversations, anecdotes, etc., making 
it a personal portrait of unusual vividness and authen- 
ticity. It will be fully illustrated with reproductions 
of \A Purge's work reproduced in photogravure. 

The Titmarsh Club of London is engaged in arrang- 
ing the celebration of the Centenary of the birth of 
Thackeray, falling on July 18, 1911. In connection 
with the celebration, a Thackeray Exhibition will be 
held as nearly as possible on that date at the Charter- 
house, by the courteous permission of the Master of the 
Charterhouse. The Club has already received many 
assurances of valuable support from collectors abroad 
and at home, and will gladly welcome further offers of 
interesting contributions to the exhibition. These con- 
tributions may include personal relics as well as items 
of literary and artistic interest connected with the great 
novelist. The utmost care will be taken of every object 
entrusted to the Club during the whole course of the 
exhibition, which, it is proposed, shall not last longer 
than about a fortnight. Those who intend cooperating 
with the Club in its interesting plan should communi- 
cate with the secretary, Mr. Lewis Melville, Salcombe, 
Harpenden, Herts, England.

NOW READY 

A History of the French Academy 

BY D. MACLAREN ROBERTSON 

\ N original history in English from the Academy's foundation, compendious yet adequate, 
^*- treating of its General History; of that of its Dictionary, an institution of itself; of its 
Membership (with its composition in three different lists), whose literary achievement is 
placed under the eye of the reader in brief biographies in a more compact form than any- 
where else between two covers, even in French. Shows clearly, also, the relationship 
between the five great national Academies and the Institute pf France, of which the history 
is sketched in outline. 

The authority of its sources, its thoroughness and completeness within its scope, its fund 
of information and anecdote, should make this book what it aims to be, a permanent work of 
reference as an authority in England on (in Hallam's phrase) "the most illustrious institution 
in the annals of polite literature," besides forming for the general reader an agreeable story 
and for the student an introduction to the French literary and political history of nearly three 
centuries. 

8vo. Cloth-bound. Seven full-page half-tone illustrations. 405 pages. 
Price, $3. 00 net. Postage, 15 cents.
